"(CNN) -- Years ago, a friend of mine considered getting a mobile phone, but he opted for a car phone instead. He just couldn't imagine needing to call someone when he was walking around. As humans, we often have a hard time seeing the significance of new technologies. When the telephone came out, the telegraph companies dismissed it as ""idiotic."" Many of the first television programs consisted of people reading radio scripts. According to popular legend, Thomas Watson of IBM once declared that the worldwide market for computers was ""five."" When the web arrived, it was like an entirely new dimension. It allowed us to publish things into ""cyberspace,"" where anyone could see them. We could instantly pull up facts on any topic. Soon e-commerce emerged, allowing us to research products, buy things with one click and track our shipments in real-time. Social networks allowed us to publish profiles and learn about others in ways never before possible. It was a Cambrian explosion of knowledge. To this day, we struggle to remember what life was like without it. Should we fear mind-reading future tech? The physical world, by comparison, is pre-internet. Each day we walk past buildings wondering what they are. We wait at busy intersections, hoping that a taxi will eventually come our way. We go to clothing stores blindly hoping to find things we like, and we cross paths with thousands of people, knowing nothing about them. For some reason this does not seem weird to us. It has always been this way. For the second time in as many decades, a new dimension is opening up. The mobile phones that once seemed so useless are now everywhere. And they are powerful -- with GPS receivers, gyroscopes, accelerometers, and proximity sensors. They can speak to other databases, access the internet, and publish things into the air above our heads. It's a new type of spatial web: one that gives us real-time data about the people, places and things physically around us. Mapping and local search apps like Yelp have been popular since the early days of the iPhone. More recently, improvements in battery life and location technology have given rise to services like Uber and Lyft, which let you request a ride and track your driver as a moving dot on a map, coming to pick you up. TaskRabbit and Exec do similar things for local errands, and HotelTonight lets you book a last minute hotel nearby with the tap of a button. This new web is also changing the way we socialize. Imagine if you could see information about the people standing near you. Your phone could notify you when friends were nearby, help you remember people's names, and surface the hidden connections you have with others in the room. Just by looking at someone you could know all about them. This is what we are building at Highlight. Do our mobiles own us? New hardware devices like Pebble and Google Glass will be the early browsers of this spatial web, allowing us to see this information without pulling out our phones. Eventually it'll move to contact lens overlays. With improved battery life and storage technology, we'll be able to capture our entire lives on video (or some equivalent) and recall the past at any time. Imagine being able to go back to the first moment you met your wife or relive a family vacation you took when you were eight years old. The social, legal, and psychological implications are just staggering. So how do we feel about this shift? It's been fascinating to see how people react to Highlight. At first, the idea of sharing a profile with the people around you is a bit jarring to some. It's not because we are inherently opposed to the idea. It's because we've never even had to consider it. It just hasn't been possible until now. Just like with the Web, we need to figure out how we want to use this technology. What things do we want to share? What should the social norms be? What privacy settings do we want? The potential of this technology is tremendous. Knowing more about the world around you just makes life better. It makes you more informed and educated. It saves time and reduces inefficiencies. Most importantly, it makes people friendlier. They smile more, talk more, see the hidden connections around them. In another decade, we are going to look back and wonder how we ever got by without this, and how we lived for so long blind to the world around us. I am excited for that day to come. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Davison.","New tech has always been met with doubt, criticism but in the end, real-world application prevails, says Davison .
Google Glass and Pebble will be the first to combine the physical world and the web .
Davison argues this new tech creates more social people who are more informed and educated ."
"Cairo (CNN) -- As protesters battled supporters of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy outside his palace, his chief of staff announced Thursday that the president would address the nation later in the day. The chief of staff, Refaa El-Tahtawy, said the speech would include important news but did not specify what that might be. The announcement came hours after demonstrations erupted into violence Wednesday night over Morsy's assumption of sweeping powers last month. Three of Morsy's advisers resigned Wednesday in protest of his edict, while demonstrators set fire to offices of the Muslim Brotherhood and its political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party, in three cities. The unrest comes as Egypt lurches toward a scheduled December 15 referendum on a new constitution. Days of largely peaceful protests in Tahrir Square had preceded Wednesday's violence. But that all changed Wednesday. After Morsy supporters chased protesters from the grounds, pro- and anti-Morsy demonstrators threw rocks, fireworks and Molotov cocktails at each other. Late in the day, a spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood called on protesters to withdraw from the area of the palace ""and not to protest there again due to its significant symbolic position as the president's office."" The Health Ministry reported four were killed and 271 were injured; state media reported earlier in the night that no one was killed. Dr. Mohamed Sultan, a spokesman for the ministry, said the injuries ranged from bruises to cuts, burns and fractures. More marches were promised for Thursday, said Rami Shath, a member of the Revolutionary Alliance and the Free Egyptian Party. ""We hold opposition figures, namely Sabbahi & ElBaradei, fully responsible for escalation of violence & inciting their supporters,"" said the Muslim Brotherhood in a tweet, referring to opposition leaders Hamdeen Sabbahi and Mohamed ElBaradei. Morsy, Egypt's first freely elected leader, was a Muslim Brotherhood leader before winning office in June, when he resigned from the movement and the Freedom and Justice Party to represent all Egyptians, he said. Demonstrators were protesting his recent edict granting himself sweeping powers and the proposed constitution -- drafted by an Islamist-dominated council -- that they fear will give him even more power. ""This is not what we asked for,"" one protester said. ""It's a complete dictatorship."" Other protesters vowed to remain in the streets until Morsy is forced to leave office. ""He's not our president anymore,"" another protester said. The three advisers who announced their resignations said they had done so after failing to persuade Morsy to reverse his November 23 decree. ""He has rejected all our suggestions and initiatives that may have avoided the cycle of violence we are witnessing today,"" Ayman al-Sayad, Seif Abdel Fattah, and Mohammed Esmat said in a joint statement. But the powerful Muslim Brotherhood called the protesters ""thugs"" who were trying to overthrow the president. ""By the grace of God, the Egyptian people will be able to protect this legitimacy, its constitution and its institutions,"" the group said on its Facebook page. Ahmed Sobea, a spokesman of the Freedom and Justice Party, said the party's offices in the northeastern cities of Suez and Ismailia had been ransacked and torched by masked, armed men on Wednesday night. The offices were empty when the attacks occurred, Sobea said. State-run Nile TV broadcast pictures of the Ismaila office on fire and reported that other masked men had burned the Muslim Brotherhood headquarters in the northeastern city of Zagazig. Opposition leaders are prepared to open talks with Morsy if he withdraws his edict and delays the referendum, said ElBaradei, leader of the liberal Constitution Party and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate. But Vice President Mahmoud Mekki said the referendum will be held as planned. ""Saying the referendum will be held on time is not being stubborn,"" Mekki said. ""The president has backtracked from decisions before; he's not a stubborn character."" Morsy's decree placed his decisions out of the reach of courts until a new constitution is approved. He said the move was designed to protect the spirit of the popular 2011 uprising that drove former strongman Hosni Mubarak from power. Critics call it a power grab. Egyptian judges and media outlets as well as liberal political groups have protested Morsy's decree and the proposed constitution, saying it goes against the goals of the revolution. How the struggle plays out could have repercussions across the Middle East and North Africa, regions already wracked by upheaval. In nearby Gaza and Israel, tensions remain high after last month's fighting. In Syria, a civil war has raged since March 2011. Wednesday's violence followed clashes Tuesday outside the palace, which has become the focus of protests by Egypt's liberal opposition. On Tuesday night, police fired tear gas after anti-Morsy protesters broke through barbed wire around the palace and hurled chairs and rocks at retreating officers. After the initial clashes, police withdrew behind fences and the demonstration was peaceful for several hours. Yassir Ali, a spokesman for the presidential office and the vice president, told reporters Wednesday that the presidential office had ordered the security forces at the palace ""to protect the protesters and keep them safe."" ""The orders to the security forces were not to confront (them), (but) to preserve the lives of the protesters and to prevent any clashes between the security forces and the protesters,"" Ali said. CNN's Reza Sayah and Journalists Mohamed Fadel Fahmy and Sarah Sirgany reported from Cairo, CNN's Michael Pearson, Joe Sterling, Saad Abedine and Yousuf Basil reported from Atlanta, and Sarah Brown and Laura Smith-Spark reported from London.","Morsy chief of staff says president's address will contain important information .

"(CNN) -- A veteran airport screener at New York's JFK Airport has been charged with grand larceny after he allegedly stole two iPads that were planted in a checked bag as part of a police sting. Port Authority police initiated the sting after passengers complained of electronic devices being taken from luggage. While the case highlights a recurring problem of theft at Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, one law enforcement official said it illustrates an even bigger threat. ""If they (an unscrupulous employee) can be taking stuff out of bags, what can they be putting in? That's a serious issue,"" said the official, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to talk about the case. TSA screeners at LAX arrested on narcotics trafficking charges . In the JFK incident, there was no suggestion that anything other than attempted theft was involved. Police said a ""decoy bag"" was placed among checked luggage at Terminal 4 at JFK on Tuesday. Police later stopped the screener as he was leaving work on board the airport's AirTrain system. In his backpack, police found the two planted iPads that had been in the decoy bag. They also found in his possession other electronic devices and earphones that had been reported stolen from luggage, and additional stolen items in his home. Oakland traveler arrested for watch 'art' that TSA thinks is timing device . Port Authority police identified the man as Sean Henry, 32, of Brooklyn, and said he had been a TSA screener for 10 years. Henry is charged with three counts of grand larceny, one count of petty larceny and official misconduct. Efforts by CNN to reach Henry were unsuccessful. TSA spokesman David Castelveter said the individual, who he did not name, ""is being processed for removal from TSA."" ""TSA holds its employees to the highest ethical standards and has zero tolerance for misconduct in the workplace,"" Castelveter said.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Crew members of the boats that collided in Hong Kong's deadliest maritime disaster in decades may face manslaughter charges, according to the director of public prosecutions, who spoke Wednesday at the preliminary hearing of the commission of inquiry. Thirty nine people, including eight children, were killed after a company-owned boat carrying Hong Kong Electric employees and their families was upended by a regular passenger ferry off Lamma, an outlying island. Revelers had been en route to Victoria Harbor to watch fireworks celebrating China's National Day on October 1. The Director of Public Prosecutions, Kevin Zervos, told the commission that he expects police to bring charges as early as next month against the seven crew members arrested from both boats. On Friday, the commission's chairman denied all applications to adjourn the hearing to a later date. Information presented at the public commission of inquiry would unduly influence potential members of the jury, Zervos had argued on Wednesday, requesting the commission postpone hearing evidence related to the cause of the collision. The chairman said that a judge in a criminal trial would instruct the jury to review evidence presented in court and ignore information they had received in any other way. The chairman also rejected applications from lawyers representing the boat operators and crews to adjourn the hearing until next month. They had requested more time to review 30 boxes of government documents, compiled by rescue services, marine officials, and other departments. The commission of inquiry was appointed in October to investigate the causes of the accident, assess safety practices of passenger vessels, and make recommendations to avoid similar incidents. It will not determine civil or criminal liability. The hearing will begin on December 12. The commission is expected to submit its report to the Chief Executive, the city's leader, by April.","Commission of inquiry into Hong Kong's deadliest boat crash in decades held preliminary hearing .

"Gaza City (CNN) -- Exiled Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal arrived in Gaza Friday to a hero's welcome, two weeks after a bloody fight with Israel that left the group energized and emboldened. He dropped down and kissed the ground after crossing into Gaza from Egypt at the Rafah border crossing. ""We politicians, we owe the people of Gaza, and the entire factions of the resistance, we owe the heroes and martyrs,"" Meshaal said. ""if it wasn't for you we would have not visited Gaza."" A jubilant crowd lined the road leading from the border crossing into Gaza City. Among the throng were hundreds of jubilant Hamas fighters, wearing fatigues and balaclavas, hoisting AK-47s and RPG launchers, and cheering Meshaal's first visit to the Palestinian territory. Opinion: With cease-fire, Hamas' isolation has ended . The first appointments on his schedule included visits to the homes of former Hamas leaders and Gaza residents killed in recent years by Israeli's strikes. Among the stops were the home of the Hamas military leader whose targeted killing by Israel in November opened the recent eight-day conflict, as well as the home where 10 members of one family died in an Israeli airstrike. Saturday, he will participate in a rally celebrating the 25th anniversary of the founding of Hamas. Meshaal, who has led Hamas from exile since 2004, is making his first visit to Gaza and his first to the Palestinian territories in 45 years. He left the Palestinian West Bank in 1967 at the age of 11 after Israel moved into the territory during the Six-Day War. Israel, under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, attempted to assassinate him in 1997. ""I say this my third birth,"" Meshaal told supporters, saying the first was his natural birth in 1956, while the second followed the attempted assassination. ""And this moment today, December 7, 2012, this I consider it to be my third birth, Meshaal said. ""And I ask God for our fourth birth with the entire liberation of Palestine."" Read more: What is Hamas? The goal of Hamas is an Islamic fundamentalist Palestinian state. Its manifesto advocates the destruction of the state of Israel, and calls for the raising of ""the banner of Allah over every inch of Palestine."" Hamas members, like most Palestinian factions and political parties, insist that Israel is an occupying power, and that the group is simply trying to liberate the Palestinian territories. Israel, the United States and other Western countries label Hamas a terrorist organization. The United States has also listed Meshaal as a terrorist since 2003. Hamas leader tells Amanpour his group wasn't behind bombing . Meshaal has previously said the group would support a Palestinian state based on the borders that existed prior to the 1967 Six-Day War, during which Israeli troops occupied Gaza, the West Bank, the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem. The state would have East Jerusalem as its capital, he said. However, he has stopped short of backing a full two-state solution, including acceptance of Israel's right to exist. He has long advocated a role for the threat of violence in forcing peace with Israel. ""You are successful in negotiation and in imposing your conditions on the enemy depending on the number of power cards you have on the ground,"" the Congressional Research Service quoted Meshaal as saying, citing a Jordanian newspaper. That perspective will be in full view in Saturday's rally. Meshaal will speak to the assembled throng from a platform beneath a replica of the Qassam rockets fired at Israel during the recent conflict, in which 160 Palestinians and six Israelis died. The inscription on the rocket? ""Made in Gaza."" Read more: Palestinian UN bid explained .

"(CNN) -- Four decades ago it was merely barren desert land. Four years ago it was at the height of an unparalleled economic boom that turned to bust amid the global financial crisis. Today the emirate of Dubai is staging a lively comeback, once again announcing the kind of ambitious plans that made it famous in the first place. Most recently, it outlined plans to build a brand new city. Named after its ruler, Mohammed bin Rashid, it is intended to house a hundred hotels and a Universal Studios entertainment center. It is the latest in a string of glitzy projects, among them the world's tallest building, the world's largest shopping mall -- even man-made islands and in-door ski resorts. In 2009, cheap credit had spurred a considerable real estate bubble in the Gulf state, which once it burst, caused property prices to tumble and debt to spiral out of control. The lifeline came from the neighbor Abu Dhabi, which extended a multi-billion dollar bailout loan. Dubai was forced to get its house in order. Today, the emirate has gone back to its core strength, Philippe Dauba-Pantanacce, senior economist at Standard Chartered, tells CNN. One of the biggest growth drivers, he says, is the airport activity. ""It's estimated that by the end of this year, 56 million people will have gone through Dubai airports. That makes it one of the three to four biggest airports in the world."" But travelers are no longer just passing through. Analysts say the Arab Spring has made Dubai a safe haven for people in the Middle East who worry about the turmoil elsewhere. ""Tourists from other Gulf states have increased by 45% in 2012. This has pushed up hotel occupancy to nearly 90% -- a world record,"" Dauba-Pantanacce says. That has lifted confidence. ""The trajectory is positive at the moment,"" says Stuart Anderson, managing director at Standard & Poor's, adding that Dubai has benefited from rising oil prices. Yet, for a state that was once riddled with debt, some say financing remains a concern. ""Though Dubai has been able to make good on all its obligations in 2012, the Dubai story cannot be completely separated from the debt overhang which is still there,"" Dauba-Pantanacce says. The hope is that projects like Mohammed bin Rashid will lure millions more visitors a year. And though similar projects were shelved only a few years ago, the citizens of Dubai avow that the hard lessons have been learned.","Four years ago Dubai was at the height of an unparalleled economic boom that then turned to bust .

"(CNN) -- And EW's Entertainer of the Year is... Ben Affleck! Having captivated moviegoers both in front of and behind the camera with ""Argo,"" Ben Affleck earned the number one spot on our annual list of the most talented and original performers who entertained us in 2012. Fifteen years after he bounded onto the Hollywood scene in 1997′s ""Good Will Hunting,"" the 40-year-old Affleck is now older and wiser — and may very well be headed back to the Oscar stage for his political thriller about the real-life covert CIA mission that freed six diplomats from Tehran during the Iran hostage crisis. ""I had very low expectations for 'Argo's' performance,"" says the leading man-turned-director. ""I just hoped that over time people would find the movie. Also, being at a place in my life and my career where I know what I'm trying to do, it's different than being 26. When you're younger and have the early success that I had — it sounds like the worst Hallmark cliche — but I didn't have anyone to share it with. I don't mean I wanted someone to sit by the fire with. But when you have a family and children, you kind of see yourself reflected in them. I want to make the kinds of movies that my kids are proud of. I have higher standards, in a way, for them."" Not that everyone back at the Affleck household was thrilled about his shaggy '70s Method hairdo and beard. Says Affleck of his wife Jennifer Garner's reaction: ""My wife is a very polite and kind woman. She and the kids did not like the beard. It had an exposed wire vibe. It was hated in my home."" EW Daily Poll: 'New Girl': Who'd make the best match? ""Argo"" producer George Clooney also weighs in on Affleck's triumphant return to the A-list after a decade of ups and downs. ""Hollywood loves a comeback, and he's an unbelievable comeback kid."" Of course, Affleck isn't the only person who had a great year. That's why we asked a select group of famous folks to offer their own tributes to the others who made our list: . Charlize Theron on the star of ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" Jennifer Lawrence: ""How is it that she can just stand there, not saying a word, and make us feel so much? Her talent is undeniable, and she is a force to be reckoned with."" Aziz Ansari on the cast of Showtime's knotty conspiracy series ""Homeland"": ""The turns are unexpectedly sharp, and the season's plot has been aggressively paced in the best way. To put it bluntly, crazy s— just keeps happening."" Nathan Fillion on geek godhead and ""Avengers"" director, Joss Whedon: ""He does what he does for the right reasons: this guy loves telling stories.... There are millions of people who've known of his talent for years, thanks to Buffy, Angel, and Firefly. Now it seems like everybody knows.""

"(EW.com) -- For Broadway producers, Thanksgiving brought some extra trimmings this year. According to figures from the Broadway League, a dozen Broadway shows topped $1 million at the box office for the week ending Nov. 25 — the first time that's happened all year. Perennial musical hits led the list: ""Wicked"" ($2.3 million), ""The Lion King"" ($2.1 million), ""The Book of Mormon"" ($1.8 million), and ""Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark"" ($1.78 million). The fifth slot went to the just-opened revival ""Annie,"" which took a stroll down Easy Street by selling $1.5 million in tickets, 105 percent of the show's potential gross and a house record for the Palace Theatre. (Premium ticket charges spiked the average ticket price to $116, from $89 the week before.) Two other new productions took advantage of seasonal enthusiasm: ""A Christmas Story: The Musical,"" which opened last Monday, took in $1.1 million for the week — though it managed to sneak in an extra ninth performance to goose its box office total. The show earned a promising 70 percent of its potential gross. Another holiday-themed screen-to-stage musical, Elf, fell just short of the seven-figure mark with $997,000 over eight performances, about 60 percent of its potential gross. Filling out the million-dollar club last week: ""Once"" ($1.17 million), ""The Phantom of the Opera"" ($1.13 million), ""Mary Poppins"" ($1.12 million), ""Newsies"" ($1.11 million), ""Evita"" ($1.01 million), and ""Jersey Boys"" ($1.01 million). The Al Pacino-led revival of ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" earns an asterisk for the week — and not just because the high-grossing nonmusical drama is officially still in previews before its Dec. 8 premiere. ""Glengarry"" used the Thanksgiving holiday to scale back its schedule to five performances (instead of its usual seven). As a result, its haul last week was just $853,737, down from $1.16 million the previous week. EW Daily Poll: Who will win 'Dancing With the Stars'? Meanwhile, turkey time had a very different meaning for the producers of ""Scandalous,"" the new musical biography of Aimee Semple McPherson with book and lyrics by Kathie Lee Gifford. In its first full week since its Nov. 15 opening, the show scraped up a thin gruel of $194,511, less than 16 percent of its potential gross, and played to houses that were less than one third full. Even a presidential pardon is unlikely to save this one. See original story at EW.com. CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly . © 2011 Entertainment Weekly and Time Inc.

"JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, has temporarily banned YouTube to block access to a video that many Muslims consider anti-Islamic. Protesters demonstrate against an anti-Islamic film in front of the Dutch embassy in Jakarta. Indonesia's Communications and Information Minister sent a letter to all Internet providers ordering them to block the video-sharing Web site until further notice, a ministry spokesman said Tuesday. The minister has asked YouTube to remove the 15-minute movie ""Fitna,"" but has not received a reply from the company, the spokesman said. ""Fitna,"" which is the work of Dutch lawmaker Geert Wilders, features disturbing images of terrorist acts juxtaposed over verses from the Quran to paint Islam as a threat to Western society. It has been posted on several Web sites, including Google Video and YouTube. Last week, about 50 Indonesia students broke into a Dutch consulate compound to protest the movie. They tore off the gate of the embassy in the city of Medan and ripped down a flag, said a Dutch Embassy spokeswoman. Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkanende has said his government is worried that Geert Wilders' film could provoke a violent backlash. The film has also prompted protests in other parts of the Muslim world. Soon after its release last month, hundreds of angry Muslims rallied in Pakistan, where the government temporarily blocked access to YouTube because of a trailer for Wilders' film. The protesters burned the Dutch flag and called on Pakistan to cut ties with the Netherlands. The Dutch government and others, including the European Union and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, have rejected the film. The OIC has 57 member states across four continents and claims on its Web site to be the second largest inter-governmental organization, after the United Nations. In its statement, it urged the international community to condemn the showing of the film and asked the Dutch government to prosecute the author of the documentary under Dutch law. But Wilders has stood by his project. ""My intention was not to offend in any way, but to show the truth -- at least the truth as I see it,"" Wilders told CNN. ""And if the truth hurts and could be offensive, well, this of course is not my problem.""  Watch interview with Dutch lawmaker Geert Wilder. » . Wilders is a member of the Dutch parliament from the conservative Party for Freedom and an outspoken critic of Islam. He said he has ""big problems"" with Islam's Prophet Mohammed, the Quran and ""everything that is stated inside this terrible book."" The title, ""Fitna,"" translates in Arabic to ""strife"" or ""conflict"" of the type that occurs within families or any other homogenous group. The film opens with passages from the Quran, interspersed with graphic images of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against the United States . The video also includes disturbing images of other terror attacks -- bloodied victims; beheadings of hostages; executions of women in hijab, the traditional Muslim attire; and footage, with subtitles, of Islamic leaders preaching inflammatory sermons against Jews and Christians.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea's decision to launch a second long-range rocket this year, in the face of international condemnation, could be partly due to internal instability, a senior South Korean government official said Friday. ""This action is driven primarily by domestic demand,"" the official said, declining to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. Read more: What does North Korea's planned rocket launch mean? North Korea has said it will launch the rocket between Monday and December 22 in a fresh attempt to put a satellite in orbit. But other countries, including the United States, say the move is a cover for testing ballistic missile technology, which the United Nations has forbidden the North from doing. Analysts have cited a number of possible reasons for Pyongyang's decision to carry out an unprecedented second launch this year, after a failed effort in April, including significant anniversaries related to the reclusive state's ruling dynasty. But the South Korean official on Friday suggested that political and pragmatic concerns might be greater motivations for the nuclear-armed North Korean regime. Read more: Kim Jong Un tightens his grip . The North's young leader, Kim Jong Un, has used unusual expressions and words, such as ""rebellion,"" in recent statements, the South Korean government official said. ""He refers to the possibility of uprisings or impure elements of those who are not content with the status of the country,"" the official said. Read more: North Korea moves closer to rocket launch, group says . Kim has been sending North Korean police to a foreign country for training in dealing with riots, according to the official, and has increased his personal physical protection. He is also said to have ordered law enforcement agencies to root out those who are not happy with recent military and cabinet changes that he has imposed, according to the official. ""There is a large scale witch hunt going on,"" he said, declining to disclose the sources of his information. There has been little sign of division in articles published by the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency. One item Friday referred to the leader as ""the dear respected Kim Jong Un."" Pyongyang has said the planned rocket launch would be ""true to the behests"" of Kim Jong Il, the late North Korean leader and father of Kim Jong Un. The elder Kim died on December 17 last year, so the first anniversary of his death falls within the launch window that North Korea has announced. Read more: Kim warns troops to prepare for 'sacred war' Experts also speculate that Pyongyang wants this launch to happen before the end of 2012, the year that marks the centenary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea and grandfather of the current leader. A presidential election on December 19 in the country's neighbor and rival, South Korea, also takes place inside the launch window. What's more, Seoul had planned its own rocket launch aimed at putting a satellite in orbit late last month before postponing it minutes before takeoff. Pyongyang insists that this is a ""peaceful scientific and technological satellite launch,"" but even China, a key ally, has given a cool reception to the prospect.

Security Council resolutions, China hopes the DPRK can proceed from the overall situation of peace and stability on the peninsula and act prudently,"" Hong Lei, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said at a news briefing this week, according to Xinhua, the Chinese state news agency. DPRK is an abbreviation of North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The South Korean government has declined to say what exactly its response might be if the North Korean rocket launch goes ahead. ""We will send a message that North Korea will have to heed,"" the senior government official said cryptically on Friday. ""Something that will deter any future provocations."" Japan, for its part, has said it will shoot the rocket down if it threatens any part of its territory. South Korean media this week cited unidentified officials as saying that the North had completed installing the three-stage rocket on its launch pad at the Sohae Space Center on the west coast of the country. But an analysis published Thursday by the U.S. academic website 38 North questions that claim. Run by the School of Advanced International Studies at John Hopkins University, 38 North says, ""We believe these reports are inaccurate based on satellite imagery and lessons from past North Korean rocket launches."" The process may have been delayed by a light snowfall, the website's analysis says, but North Korea could still have the rocket ready in time for the start of the launch window. This is the first time North Korea has attempted a rocket launch in winter, and experts say the timing of preparations and the launch itself will depend heavily on weather conditions. ""Pyongyang's announcement of a twelve-day launch window, over twice as long as the five-day window for the April 2012 test, may have been based on careful consideration of possible delays or technical problems due to winter weather,"" 38 North says. Previous launch attempts by the North in 2006 and 2009 also failed to achieve their stated goal of putting a satellite in orbit and provoked international condemnation. CNN's Jethro Mullen in Hong Kong and Alex Zolbert in Tokyo contributed to this report.","North Korea says it will launch a rocket as early as next week .

"(CNN) -- I grew up about 30 minutes north of Boston in a town that was a virtual melting pot — I was exposed to all different backgrounds, cultures, and religions, fueling my personal interests in global issues. My teenage years were dotted by regular interactions with people like me from all around the world — people I could connect with about these issues. I was lucky to be able to expand my understanding of the world in this way. Now, with the arrival of Facebook, YouTube and other social media, young people everywhere in the United States have an incredible opportunity to learn from their peers in other countries and partner to make a huge impact in addressing global health issues. I know how hard it can be for young people in high school, college, or just starting out, to balance schoolwork, relationships and other activities. But today is World AIDS Day, and we should each find a way to use the moment to raise awareness about this global pandemic and unite in the fight against HIV. That's why this weekend I participated in an event with young reproductive health advocates from New York who got up early to tune into a live webcast from Johannesburg, South Africa. The webcast featured young leaders in the fight against HIV/AIDS responding to questions from the youth in New York and around the world. The conversation focused on how young people are leading the charge in HIV advocacy and prevention, and it was a part of Planned Parenthood Global's and the Global Youth Coalition on HIV/AIDS' efforts to mark World AIDS Day on Saturday. Those young people include folks like Brandon, 17, and Lena, 19, who work with their peers at Planned Parenthood Metro Washington's Ophelia Egypt Center. The Egypt Center is a community program that helps educate young people about reproductive health. Brandon and Lena are both giving back to their community and making sure their peers have accurate and comprehensive information about their health care. That's how we're going to fight HIV/AIDS -- by engaging and empowering young people to help themselves and their peers stay HIV free. This is the demographic that is most vulnerable to unintended pregnancy, STDs and HIV/AIDS. In fact, worldwide, young people still make up about 40 percent of all new HIV infections. While we've made a lot of progress in fighting HIV, we know there is great room for improvement. In many countries around the world, young people are still often unable to access quality health care. Testing and treatment can be problematic where resources and geography make it difficult. In the United States, the situation isn't much better, especially for young people. A recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report finds that more than half of people infected with HIV in the U.S. aged 13 to 24 don't know they have it. That same age group is responsible for more than a quarter of new U.S. infections each year. On ""Glee,"" we often tackle the tough topics that young people face — in fact, my recurring character, Wade ""Unique"" Adams, is a transgender teenager who finds herself navigating a lot of the same problems many young people face around the globe. While these challenges are different everywhere, young people now see themselves connected to the world beyond our borders. The Internet, mobile technology, the 24-hour news cycle and immigration have all helped contribute to this new global identity. We are living in a world that is increasingly without borders. That's why events like the one I participated in this weekend are so important — they help open a dialogue between young health advocates in the United States and the rest of the world on what programs and policies need to be put in place. We need these global conversations if we are going to win the battle against HIV, because there is so much we can learn from one another's successes and continued challenges. Of course, it won't all rest on our shoulders. Some of our leaders already know just how important this issue is for young people. Thanks to President Barack Obama, under the Affordable Care Act, millions more people will be eligible for health insurance, including many people with HIV. In November, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force also recommended that all Americans aged 15-65 receive routine HIV testing, not just those most at risk. If finalized, this would mean insurers would have to cover HIV screening without a co-pay, saving young people some much-needed money. With new investments in medically accurate sex education and the evolution of health technology as a means to educate and communicate with more people than ever before, we have new tools to address the HIV epidemic. On World AIDS Day and every day, there is much to be done. Talk to your friends, schoolmates and family — face to face or online — about this global problem, ensure your loved ones get the information and care they need and deserve, and let your legislators know that you support policies that help young people get the care they need. It will be impossible for us to eradicate HIV as long as any corner of the world is cut off from the education and services that we know helps stop the spread of this disease. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alex Newell.","Alex Newell says he grew up in a melting pot near Boston, exposed to diverse humanity .

"(CNN) -- Dangling from the top of a 20 meter mast while bouncing along the open waves would test even the most hardened sailor's stomach. If the vertigo doesn't rattle you, the mast lurching at a 45 degree angle will. Then there's the real possibility the whole boat could capsize under the strain -- plunging you deep under water with it. But for maritime photographer Kos Evans -- who pioneered the hazardous art of masthead photography and bagged some of sailing's greatest images in the process -- it's all part of the day-job. The extraordinary pictures, taken from masts up to 10 storeys-high, capture sailors the size of ants scuttling around on sleek white decks, surrounded by churning ocean and enormous rippling sails. Looking back at a career that now spans over three decades, Evans recalls the reaction to her first foray into masthead photography in the early 1980s. ""The pictures were incredible because no one had taken a photo from that angle before,"" she said. ""A lot of guys wouldn't do it, so there was admiration and respect for the fact I was trying something new. The media completely pounced on it."" An exhilarating oeuvre of images followed, and Evans has since been shortlisted for the prestigious British Sports Photography Awards, British Nautical Awards and exhibited at London's Getty Gallery. With a new book, set to be published in January, chronicling in vivid detail the work that has made her a household name in sailing circles, it's funny to think that it all began as little more than a dare. After graduating from the London College of Printing with a degree in photography, Evans landed a dream job taking pictures aboard British yacht Victory, during the 1982 America's Cup. It was a joke by the crew that first prompted her to shimmy up the 24 meter mast. ""They thought it would be quite funny to send me up the mast to get me out of their hair, as I'd been photographing them day-in-day-out for a few weeks,"" Evans writes in the upcoming book. Little did they realize the young woman was well up to the challenge, having been raised in a sailing family and yachting since the age of three. ""Once at the top I started shooting, but my feet kept swinging into frame and I had to find ways of wrapping my legs around the mast so I could virtually hang upside down and not fall out of the bosun's chair."" The result was a remarkable image of the vibrant white, blue and yellow sail billowing around the seemingly tiny deck, later used as the poster for Victory's America's Cup campaign. ""Kos is known for her spectacular shots -- whether they be from the top of the mast of a racing yacht or at incredible angles within the water. She brings the colors to life and manages to capture yachts and yachting in the right moment,"" said Jamie Edmiston, managing director at international superyacht charter company Edmiston. ""In an industry that was largely dominated by men she carved out a highly respected position and reputation,"" she added. Capturing such striking images comes with its dangers, as Evans discovered in the early 1990s when the yacht she was photographing capsized while she was at the top of its 18 meter mast. She had been presenting a television show when the skipper lost control of the yacht. ""We were down in seconds,"" said Evans. ""Fortunately one of the crew had cut the rope [attaching me to the mast] so I was able to pull myself away. To this day I always carry a knife with me."" When not otherwise clambering up the world's tallest sailing ships, the award-winning photographer can be found hanging from a helicopter in a harness traveling 160 kilometers per-hour in hot pursuit of Powerboat World Champion competitors. Not content with aerial acrobatics, the ballsy Brit has also carved a name for herself as an accomplished underwater photographer, diving six meters below the surface to capture yachts silently slicing through the waves in the annual Maxi Yacht Rolex Cup. It's this volatile environment that keeps Evans coming back again and again. ""I love the color and drama of sailing -- the human endurance in unpredictable conditions."" ""I've never seen myself as a daredevil, my drive has always been trying to find a different image, something that hasn't been done before."" When asked if she believed she was indeed the pioneer of masthead photography, the answer is straightforward: ""Absolutely. 100%."" Judging by her plethora of dizzying images, it would be a tall task finding another photographer who could claim that hard-earned title.","Sailing photographer Kos Evans pioneers innovative masthead genre .

"(CNN) -- This week, in a scene not witnessed during the 30-year rule of Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian presidential palace was encircled with barbed wire as thousands of protesters opposing President Mohamed Morsy besieged it from all sides. The visual is shocking, considering that a few short months ago, Morsy stood without a shield to give a speech to thousands in Tahrir Square. Most experts would agree that Mubarak did not start out as the dictator he ultimately became. Indeed, the oppression, torture and crackdown on opposition his regime was known for grew gradually over the years before reaching the height of brutality in his last term. It also took at least 10 years of determined commitment by activists and opposition to make change. The opposition grew from a few people beaten by police while peacefully protesting on the stairs of the Supreme Court to more organized groups such as Kefaya and April 6, to the massive citizens uprising of January 25, 2011. But in just a few months, Morsy already has deployed all the ingredients of authoritarianism: intimidating media outlets, defaming opposition and casting doubt on their patriotism and intentions and using violence and detention against protesters. On November 22, Morsy finally crowned these atrocities with a constitutional declaration granting him complete power over the executive, legislative and judiciary authorities, with no accountability. When the act was denounced at home and abroad, Morsy claimed that these are temporary measures were required to protect the revolution and help the transition to democracy. What has followed have been the opposite of democratic. Explainer: What's driving Egypt's unrest? Morsy quickly announced that there would be a December 15 referendum to vote on the new draft constitution that was rushed through by the Islamist-dominated constituent assembly. The majority of liberal and secular voices had already boycotted the committee over a lack of transparency in the drafting process. Despite protests, strikes and a declaration by federal judges that they will not monitor what they consider to be an illegitimate referendum, Morsy shows no sign of reversing course -- ignoring opposition in the fashion of Mubarak. But Mubarak was not democratically elected. Then why is Morsy moving so frantically to consolidate his power without even attempting to disguise it behind a democratic facade? The answer is, Morsy is not stupid. He is aware that he only won by a 1.7% margin. A substantial number of his voters favored him only to avoid another era of military rule at the hands of his opponent, Mubarak's ex-prime minister, Ahmed Shafik. In fact, the non-Islamist opposition arguably represents the majority, but only failed to mobilize for the election because it was deeply fragmented and disorganized. But Morsy's coup has done what some thought impossible: unite the liberal/moderate opposition. Outside observers applauded Morsy's early decisions -- such as dismissing the heads of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, releasing military prisoners and banning pornographic websites -- as surprising and bold. However, these decisions were either populist or designed to appease his constituency of Islamists. Morsy avoided making any painful, but essential, decisions, such as lifting subsidies, increasing prices of utilities and dealing with unemployment. But Morsy has made three major miscalculations. First, he made appeasing his own constituency a bigger priority than winning over the opposition. This helped them to unify against him. Second, he assumed that he would be immune from international criticism after his celebrated success in brokering a cease-fire between Hamas and Israeli earlier last months. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, he underestimated the Egyptian people. The massive protests on Tuesday, which included people of all ages, incomes and walks of life, showed that the Egyptian people no longer would accept dictatorship in any form. iReport: Bloody clashes around Egyptian Presidential palace . The opposition has shaken Morsy's misconceptions: The protests have been unified and included all political forces. Meanwhile the international community is not so naive and realizes that the opposition is not simply a minority group that wants to restore the old regime, a scenario the Brotherhood spokesmen publicly propagate. All is not lost for Morsy if he is willing to change course. If he were to withdraw the declaration, call for a national dialogue and provide an opportunity for an inclusive space to redraft the current document of the constitution, there is hope for getting Egypt back on track in its transition. At a minimum, he should extend the time frame for the referendum to open the door for a real national debate. This would not only spare the divided nation from descending into violent chaos but would also save Morsy and his party. It is already evident that situation is only escalating, with more violent clashes Wednesday between supporters and opponents of Morsy in front of the presidential palace. There is no guarantee that even this will regain stability or restore Morsy's legitimacy, but what is certain is that the longer he delays his response to the angry masses, the more irreversible the situation will be. The political dynamics in Egypt have drastically changed since the revolution. Foreign governments, particularly the U.S., should factor this into its approach to engaging with Egypt. This does not mean siding with one regime or playing one group against the other, but rather siding with the principles of freedom and democracy against oppression and authoritarian rule. The Egyptians are still waiting for the Obama administration to match its fine words with actions. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nancy Okail.","Nancy Okail: In only a few months, Mohamed Morsy has provoked protests .
She says this recalls Hosni Mubarak as Morsy has upended constitutional process .
She says he has miscalculated his mandate; his actions have galvanized opposition .

"(CNN) -- For 70 years, survivors of the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor have captivated listeners with their firsthand accounts, recalling buddies who died in their arms or the glasses worn by a low-flying Japanese pilot. They have participated in solemn wreath-laying ceremonies and spoken to civic groups and school children about the infamous day and the need for the United States to remain vigilant. But the gradual loss of the World War II generation has accelerated, and this year, perhaps more than any before it, evidence of a tide change is inescapable. The Pearl Harbor Survivors Association, founded in 1958, is dissolving December 31. The passing of time, the difficulty in finding chapter officers and the health of its 2,700 members have taken their toll. ""We don't like to see it happen,"" said George Bennett, 87, the organization's national secretary and a Pearl Harbor survivor. ""But we don't have young members coming in like other organizations."" Informal social and local activities will continue, he said. About 84,000 uniformed Americans were on Oahu that fateful day. Only an estimated 8,000 are alive today -- and they are in their late 80s and older. Children and grandchildren have stepped up to carry the flag of their forefathers. The Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors, with about 20 chapters, is helping to ""carry on the legacy left to us,"" said national president Louella Large, whose father served at the U.S. Army's Schofield Barracks during the attack. Large, like others, is concerned that most U.S. schoolchildren today know almost nothing about the surprise attack that pulverized battleships and aircraft stationed at Hawaii. Flying from aircraft carriers, Japanese pilots attacked eight battleships, destroying two, and left a trail of death and destruction across the verdant landscape. About 2,400 people, most of them in the military, were killed. The attack shook America's confidence and ushered the country into World War II. About 120 Pearl Harbor survivors are registered to attend Wednesday morning's annual memorial ceremony. Four military and four civilian survivors will be on panels at a symposium that concludes Monday. No Japanese military veterans of the attack are able to be on hand for ceremonies honoring U.S. dead at the World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument. Perspectives at the symposiums, held every five years, are shifting. ""We were able in the past to (tell the story) through the mouths of those who saw it,"" said Lisa Ontai, spokeswoman for Pacific Historic Parks, an organization that assists the National Park Service. ""Now, we are showing it through experts who studied it over the years."" Among others traveling to Hawaii are families of two servicemen who died in the past two years. Remains of Vernon Olsen, 91, of Port Charlotte, Florida, will be interred Wednesday in the battleship USS Arizona, on which he served and where 1,117 sailors and Marines died in the attack. Those of Lee Soucy, 90, of Plainview, Texas, will be carried Tuesday by a diver to the USS Utah, which also is entombed off Ford Island. ""I think it's pretty awesome that we are getting to do this,"" said daughter Mary McCormick. Soucy's children also will spread ashes belonging to their father and mother, Peggy, at St. Andrew's Episcopal Cathedral in Honolulu, where the pair were married in January 1945. Peggy Soucy was a Navy nurse who met her future husband at Pearl Harbor. Memorial ceremonies, boat and bus tours are taking place this week on Oahu. Veterans and others will converge on current and former military installations, including Hickam Field, Pearl Harbor, Wheeler Army Airfield and the Marine Corps base at Kaneohe Bay. A Blu-ray version of the the 1970 film ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" with extended footage, was to be shown Sunday evening at the Pearl Harbor Visitor Center, near the USS Arizona. Historians say the passage of time is allowing for a broader, more objective look at the attack. Research has provided new insights, particularly about the Japanese perspectives and source material on the attack. In recent years, interpretation also has shifted its focus ""from engagement to peace,"" with recognition that both sides fought a ""savage war,"" said Daniel A. Martinez, chief historian at the WWII Valor in the Pacific National Monument. 'I harbor no ill will' McCormick, 65, of Amarillo, Texas, told CNN her father's enlistment was due to expire December 7, 1941. Soucy, a pharmacist's mate on the USS Utah, would vividly recall a peaceful Sunday morning that quickly turned to terror, she said. ""He was looking out the port window and saw what he thought would be his last day there. He saw these planes coming in. He thought it must be the Marines because nobody else would be working on Sunday."" The Utah was quickly disabled. Soucy swam 200 yards to shore from the sinking vessel and was quickly recruited, because of his medical training, to help treat the injured. After the war, Soucy moved to Plainview, where he raised his family. He died in January 2010; his wife passed away this year. The family will take part in the sunset ceremony, accompanied by full military honors, Tuesday at the USS Utah memorial. U.S. Navy divers will help lower the remains inside the vessel. McCormick said her father spoke at previous symposiums and met Japanese pilots. ""He forgave,"" McCormick said. ""On his Pearl Harbor Survivors garrison cap he had a button that read 'love not war' written in Japanese."" Bennett, of Battle Ground, Washington, was a radio-trained 17-year-old seaman first class on December 7, 1941. He leaves Monday to make the trip to Hawaii, where he had been assigned to a squadron of PBY-3 aircraft at Ford Island. On the day of the attack, Bennett heard explosions, but thought it might be part of a U.S. military exercise or an accident. He then saw a Japanese plane flying low over barracks near the USS California. He and others worked to put out a fire on a hangar roof, but eventually were ordered to get down. ""Toward the end, the Japanese started to strafe us up there,"" Bennett told CNN on Friday. ""We were trained to fight the Japanese, and the Japanese were trained to fight us,"" Bennett said. ""It was the leaders in Japan who made this happen. That's the way I look at it. I harbor no ill will toward the Japanese today."" Martinez and other staff members have recorded video interviews with many veterans, preserving their memories. ""They tell me stories they haven't told their families,"" he said. Teaching your children . In San Diego, Stu Hedley, 90, said fewer Pearl Harbor survivors are available in Southern California to give talks to groups or schools. Sixteen members of his chapter have died this year alone. Hedley, the head of a local survivors chapter, will take part in a December 7 program in San Diego on the USS Midway carrier. A comrade will attend a ceremony at the Veterans Museum and Memorial Center. ""We're all moving into our 90s and late 80s,"" Hedley said of the disbanding of the national organization. ""It's part of life. We have to accept it one day at a time."" More than 100 crew members on his ship, the USS West Virginia, were killed in the attack, he said. Hedley said he believes members of the U.S. government ""sold us out"" in 1941 and made the attack possible. President Franklin D. Roosevelt wanted a ""war economy ... and his idea was to let them fire the first shot,"" said the Navy veteran. These days, Hedley said, he gives two principal admonitions to students. ""My first warning to you is to stay in school. Don't quit under any circumstances."" He recounted dropping out of high school in 1939, three months before graduation. That kept him from becoming an officer. ""The other admonition is learn to live with one another,"" he said. ""Regardless of race, creed, religion or whatever."" Hedley is concerned about how little many Americans know about Pearl Harbor. ""I've had college students who have asked me what Pearl Harbor was,"" he said. ""If you can find a paragraph (in California textbooks) about Pearl Harbor, you are doing good."" Large said the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors safeguards stories of their parents. Her late father, Army Cpl. Harry M. Cross, was in an artillery unit at Schofield Barracks and got a close-up view of a Japanese pilot strafing U.S. troops. ""One of his buddies died in his arms,"" said Large, 63, of East Canton, Ohio. ""He said he had a hole in his chest where he could put his fist in."" Cross never was able to forgive the Japanese, Large said. She, however, supports moving forward and reconciliation. Large said the Sons and Daughters will take over a national scholarship the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association once managed and invite veterans to its 2012 convention. Pacific Historic Parks will publish a portion of the Gram, the survivors' newsletter. Though Large is concerned about what young people know about Pearl Harbor and its role in bringing the United States into World War II, she has experienced good moments during her efforts to spread the word. Students have told her they learned more from one of her talks than from their lessons. Large recalled talking several years ago to a group of fifth-graders, her father at her side. ""Afterward, a young boy asked if he could shake his hand. He did so,"" Large said. ""He said 'can I give you a hug?' Dad bent down and hugged him. The boy said, 'I wanted to thank you for protecting our freedom.'""","Pearl Harbors Survivors Association formally disbands at end of month .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- At least eight people were killed and thousands displaced after powerful Cyclone Nilam roared into India's southeastern coast, authorities said Thursday. About 8,000 people in low-lying areas on the coast of Tamil Nadu state were moved to temporary shelters, said Jatindranath Swain, the province's disaster management commissioner. An oil tanker with 37 people on board got into difficulty as the storm made landfall Wednesday, he said. The high winds and strong waves set the vessel adrift and drove it toward the coast, where it ran aground, Swain said. Naval divers engaged in rescue efforts at the stranded ship, according to Swain, but six crew members remained missing Thursday.

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemned recent outbreaks of violence in Northern Ireland and urged a continued commitment to peace during meetings Friday with political leaders in Belfast. ""There can be no place in Northern Ireland for any violence; the remnants of the past must be quickly condemned,"" she said. She described the violence as ""a sad reminder, unfortunately, that -- despite how hardy the peace has been -- there are still those who not only would test it, but try to destroy it."" Three people were arrested Friday, and two officers were injured, said Elsie Glendinning, a press officer for the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Some cars were set afire, she said in a statement. Twenty-one officers were injured during this week's disorder, said Assistant Chief Constable Will Kerr, who appealed for calm. ""This behavior is simply not acceptable,"" he said. ""These people are only wrecking their own communities and putting innocent people's lives at risk.""

The party said that its sole lawmaker in the UK parliament at Westminster, Naomi Long, was told Thursday night to leave her home and was advised not to go to her constituency office in east Belfast on Friday after receiving a death threat. Clinton spoke alongside First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness at Stormont, the seat of Northern Ireland's power-sharing government, in east Belfast. She recalled her first visit 17 years ago with then-President Bill Clinton, at a time when the first glimmers of peace were on the horizon. On that occasion, the couple turned on Belfast's Christmas lights. Read more: Queen makes history with ex-IRA leader handshake . ""Peace does take sacrifice and compromise and vigilance, day after day, and we have seen again this week that the work is not complete because we have seen violence break out again,"" she said. ""There will always be disagreements in democratic societies. We are experts in that in the United States ... but violence is never an acceptable response to this."" Clinton joined Robinson and McGuinness in condemning the recent violence in the Belfast area and the threats against Long. Read more: Police brace for trouble as thousands join Northern Ireland march . Robinson and McGuinness presented Clinton with an award recognizing her contribution to Northern Ireland's peace and economic progress. She then returned to Washington. McGuinness, a former commander in the anti-British Irish Republican Army, shook hands last summer with Queen Elizabeth II -- a gesture marking a step forward in the peace process relating to British rule of Northern Ireland. Belfast was the last stop on Clinton's European tour, which began with visits to the Czech Republic and Belgium. She was in Dublin on Thursday for an international security conference at which she met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and the U.N. special envoy to Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi. The timing of her visit to Northern Ireland, which she has held up to other nations as an example of a divided community that has transitioned to peace, is seen by observers as unfortunate, given the unrest. The vote on the Union flag followed a summer of heightened tensions between Northern Ireland's Catholic and Protestant communities. Riots in September left dozens of police officers injured. Just more than a month ago, a prison officer was killed in a suspected dissident IRA attack, the first such attack in years. In recent days, a number of suspected dissident IRA members have been arrested. On her first visit as secretary of state, in 2009, Clinton paid tribute to the efforts of Robinson, McGuinness and other political leaders in helping to secure more than a decade of peaceful progress for Northern Ireland. The majority of the island gained independence in 1921, following two years of conflict. But six of the nine counties of the province of Ulster chose to stay in the United Kingdom, eventually becoming the country of Northern Ireland. In the late 1960s, the conflict between mainly Protestant unionists, who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, and largely Roman Catholic nationalists, who want it to be reunited with the rest of Ireland, exploded into a political and sectarian war, known as the Troubles. The three decades of ensuing violence between loyalists and the IRA claimed more than 3,000 lives, most of them north of the border. While the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 effectively ended the conflict, distrust remains between Catholics and Protestants. Under the terms of the accord, groups on both sides dumped their weapons, and members of Sinn Fein, the political affiliate of the IRA, now work with pro-British politicians in Northern Ireland's power-sharing government.

"Washington (CNN) -- Calling it the single largest crackdown on bus companies that the Department of Transportation has ever undertaken, Secretary Ray LaHood announced Thursday the agency has shut down 26 bus operators for breaking federal safety rules. He declared the operations imminent hazards to public safety. Officials also ordered ""10 individual bus company owners, managers and employees to cease all passenger transportation operations, which includes selling bus tickets to passengers,"" the Transportation Department said in a news release. ""These operators transport over 1,800 passengers a day, up and down the I-95 corridor from New York to Florida,"" LaHood said. ""This crackdown is a victory for bus safety and the people who ride these buses."" The 26 shutdown orders apply to nine active companies, 13 companies already ordered out of service that were continuing to operate, three companies attempting to apply for operating authority and one ticket seller, the Transportation Department said. All told, the companies operate between 30 and 35 buses and are based out of Georgia, Indiana, Maryland, New York, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, according to the department. Officials allege the companies operated buses that needed repair, failed to test drivers for alcohol and drugs, failed to properly document driver medical qualifications, and kept the drivers behind the wheel beyond legal limits. ""People get up every day and use a lot of different forms of transportation without thinking about the safety factor, and we don't want them to worry about the safety of the bus they ride on or the highway they drive on,"" LaHood said. The crackdown was triggered after a series of deadly bus accidents and was the culmination of a yearlong investigation by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the Transportation Department arm tasked with regulating bus safety. On May 31, 2011, one year to the day before Thursday's announcement, four passengers were killed and 53 others injured in a Virginia bus accident. Investigators claim fatigue on the part of driver Kin Yiu Cheung caused the bus to run off the road and overturn. Cheung faces four counts of involuntary manslaughter and is slated to go to trial June 25, the Caroline County Virginia court clerk told CNN. ""The crash and other fatal crashes like it that occurred along I-95 last year led our agency to conduct this unprecedented one-year investigation into dangerous and illegal bus companies operating in violation to our basic safety standards,"" Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administrator Anne Ferro told reporters. In another accident, Ophadell Williams, 40, was behind the wheel of a tour bus that crashed into a roadside barrier in New York, killing 15 passengers. After the crash, New York state's inspector general revealed that Williams should not have been given a commercial bus driver license, but was able to obtain one by allegedly using fake names and false information. The Transportation Department's statement said it has doubled the number of bus inspections of the nation's estimated 4,000 passenger bus companies, from 12,991 in 2005 to 28,982 in 2011. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration shut down three primary companies -- Apex Bus Inc., I-95 Coach Inc. and New Century Travel Inc. -- which oversaw a broad network of other bus companies. ""Through the course of our investigations our enforcement teams found multiple patterns of glaring violations by the three networks of enterprises,"" Ferro said. She said the companies ""found loopholes"" and managed to get back on the road even after authorities had shut them down. The crackdown on alleged rogue companies was applauded by the American Bus Association, a trade group representing motor coach and tour bus companies. The agency's actions ""went far beyond random roadside inspections, and ABA very much supports these types of law enforcement efforts. We will continue to support (the agency), and we urge our members to operate at the highest level of safety,"" association President Peter Pantuso said in a statement to CNN. Buses remain a popular mode of transportation for Americans, carrying almost as many passengers each year as commercial airlines. About 750 million passengers ride passenger and tour buses each year, compared with round 800 million passengers on airlines, according to American Bus Association spokesman Dan Ronan. In March, the Transportation Department announced a new program, ""Look Before You Book,"" and a smartphone app that allows users to access the safety records of nearly 6,000 interstate commercial passenger carriers. The records consist of safety and inspection data about private bus lines, school buses and tour bus operators. To use the app, passengers can search the bus company or the company's registration number. Information provided by the app reveals who owns the bus and the bus company's safety record. A check of the app by CNN showed the companies involved with Thursday's announcement were ""not allowed to operate.""","The Department of Transportation says 26 bus operators broke safety rules .

"(CNN) -- One of the strangest sequel projects in movie history is no longer a sequel. In a joint statement, MGM Studios and Dahlia Waingort, the producer of the film originally known as Raging Bull II, declared on Wednesday that Waingort's film now has the working title The Bronx Bull, and is in no way associated with Martin Scorsese's 1980 film Raging Bull. The announcement resolves a lawsuit brought by MGM in July that attempted to shut down production on the film, which traces the life of boxer Jake LaMotta in the years that span before and after Raging Bull. LaMotta, now 91 years old, has been cooperating with that project, but it otherwise had nothing to do with Scorsese's film, which won star Robert De Niro an Academy Award. Instead, Boardwalk Empire's William Forsythe is playing the older LaMotta, with Mojean Aria playing him as a youth. Check out the full statement below: . The parties have amicably reached a resolution of their pending litigation, pursuant to which production of a film based upon certain events in the life of Jake LaMotta will proceed under the working title The Bronx Bull.

"Galway, Ireland (CNN) -- The husband of a woman who died after reportedly being refused an abortion in Ireland said Friday he will not cooperate with an inquiry into her death. Ireland's health service monitoring group -- the Health Information and Quality Authority -- Friday published the ""terms of reference"" for its investigation into the death of Savita Halappanavar at University Hospital Galway in October. The inquiry will investigate the safety, quality and standards of services provided. However, the lawyer acting for Praveen Halappanavar, Gerard O'Donnell, confirmed that his client would not support the investigation and would only accept a public inquiry. O'Donnell plans to take the case to the European Court of Human Rights. Two state investigations have been called, but Halappanavar had said he has no faith in them, claiming some of his wife's medical records have disappeared. The Irish Health Minister James Reilly said Friday he had not ruled out a public inquiry but was waiting on the interim results of an internal ""clinical review"" by the Health Service Executive before deciding his next move. The Halappanavar family says Savita died of blood poisoning after doctors declined to abort her miscarrying fetus because of Ireland's strict laws. Her husband claims she was advised her unborn baby would likely die. Halappanavar says his wife, who was in extreme pain, asked for the abortion, but was told that Ireland is a Catholic country and an abortion could not be done while the fetus was alive. Three days after the request for a termination was made, the fetus died and was removed. Four days later, Savita died of a blood infection. Her death provoked anger in Ireland and elsewhere and sparked demands for Ireland to introduce new abortion laws. The issue has been debated in Ireland's parliament, but it's unclear when, or if, a resolution will come. Prime Minister Enda Kenny said Wednesday he wants a legislative decision on abortion ""as quickly as possible."" Read more: Husband wants answers over wife whose death sparked abortion debate .

"(CNN) -- If there was a predominant reaction to this voter's indecision, shared in ""Young, Female and Undecided"" on CNN two weeks ago, it was incredulity. ""The candidates have spent billions,"" I was told. ""Their TV ads have replaced normal programming. This campaign has been longer than a life sentence. How can you still be undecided?"" To clarify, my indecision did not stem from an unrequited love for either candidate. I just could not bring myself to support either of these guys. A vote for Obama makes me a crazy, government-expanding liberal. I vote for Romney and I'm a crazy, masochistic female. The truth is that voting for a candidate doesn't mean you stand united on every issue. This is not Build-a-Bear. I cannot create my own candidate, taking the best features from each then add a glowing heart and a soft, plush, huggable exterior. Nevertheless, I have made a choice. I'm young, female and decided. Drumroll, please... I'm voting for Mitt Romney. ""Well, duh, your dad's a Republican strategist."" My father Alex Castellanos' affiliation has not affected my decision. Although I respect his ""suggestions,"" my choices are my own, as even he would tell you. What has resolved this contest for me? Was it the cantankerous candidates in the last debate, fighting to fight for the safety of our great nation? No. Personally, I found the last debate tremendously boring, except for President Obama's ""bayonets"" comment. Ultimately, my decision came down to this: I could not rehire Bobby Valentine. Valentine, manager of the Boston Red Sox this past year, was fired after a horrible season. His team's poor record wasn't entirely Bobby's fault. In fact, Red Sox general manager Ben Cherington said, ""Bobby was dealt a difficult hand."" No doubt Valentine inherited a lot of problems. But looking ahead, there was no reason for Sox fans to hope that next season Valentine would lead his team differently or deliver a better record. Obama inherited a lot of problems, too. In his defense, our expectations for hope and change were too high. Unless he Midas-touched his way through the White House, Obama was destined to disappoint us. But manager Obama has not achieved the goals he led us to believe he would. He has not turned his team around. You don't keep a failing manager when there is an acceptable alternative. It's time for a replacement. I am hoping, praying, that should he be elected, Romney's experience will lead to a positive shift in the economy and an increase in job creation. I still disagree with the governor on women's rights. Should he become president, I'm going to rely on the power of the American people to protect women from those who would set the clock back. The Cujo-like, growling TV ads attacking Romney on women's rights are cut and choreographed to make him seem appalling. Romney might not have closed the gender-gap entirely, but at least some women suspect those ads are unrealistic, more bark than bite. An ad in which Romney says, ""I would overturn Roe v. Wade"" does not include what follows, the governor stating, ""But that's not where we are. That's not where America is today.""If Romney is elected, abortion is not going to become illegal. We will not have a government official holding our hands during our annual doctor's visit. Similarly, I know Romney is against same-sex marriage. One day, I expect to tell my own children there was a time where gay people could not get married, just like my parents told me of a time I could not understand, when African-Americans were not presidents but confined to the back of the bus. Some of the progress we've made and injustices we've overcome will not be reversed, no matter who is president. ""That's not where America is today."" Romney won't be able to change everything. But what if he could change the economy? ""You can stick with what's barely working or take a chance with [Romney],"" said Jay Pharaoh, imitating the president on ""SNL."" We've had a losing streak, so I'm taking a chance. Because four years from now, if President Obama is finishing his last months in office and we're deeper in debt, still praying for a winning jobs report, I'll know I got just what I expected. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Cat Castellanos.","Cat Castellanos had been torn over which candidate to support .

"Rome (CNN) -- Italy's former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said Saturday he would run again as his country's leader, signaling a return to the limelight for the nation's most flamboyant politician. The billionaire resigned as prime minister just over a year ago at the height of his country's debt crisis, bringing to an end an 18-year era in which he dominated Italian politics. Profile: Italy's most colorful political figure . Since then, Italy has been run by an unelected, technocratic government headed by economist Mario Monti. Monti plans to step down after passage of a national budget and stability measures, Italian President Giorgio Napolitano said in a statement Saturday after meeting with Monti. ""The prime minister doesn't consider it possible to further carry out its mandate and thus he expressed his intention to resign,"" it read. The statement referenced comments made this week by the secretary of Berlusconi's party, who said that the party considers ""Monti's experience concluded."" If Monti resigns before the new year, elections could be held as early as next February, a few months earlier than the natural end of the legislature. In a message posted on his website and Facebook page, Berlusconi said: ""I'm besieged by my people that are requesting that I get back in the battlefield leading the People of Freedom, PDL party."" He said the center-right coalition had searched for a new leader, but there was no one to replace him. ""I return to politics with despair and out of a sense of responsibility,"" he said. But, he added, ""I enter the race to win."" When he resigned in November 2011, Berlusconi said he did not intend to run for office when elections were held again. But the 76-year-old's intention to return to frontline politics has been rumored in the months since. In October, a Milan court sentenced Berlusconi to four years in prison for tax evasion. However, under the Italian legal system, he and his fellow defendants have the right to appeal their sentence twice, in the appeals court and a higher court. Also, because the case dates to July 2006, the statute of limitations will expire next year, meaning there is a good chance none of the defendants will serve any prison time. Through the years, Berlusconi has been accused of embezzlement, fraud and bribery, but the tax evasion case marked the first time he had been convicted of an offense. Berlusconi also faces trial on charges that he hired an underage prostitute and later tried to pull strings to get her out of jail when she was accused of theft. The woman involved in the long-running case is Moroccan dancer Karima el Mahroug, nicknamed ""Ruby the Heart-stealer.""

"(CNN) -- Texas A&M freshman quarterback Johnny Manziel on Saturday was named the 2012 Heisman Trophy winner, making history. Manziel, whose exploits led to his being dubbed ""Johnny Football,"" is the first freshman to win the Heisman, college football's most prestigious award. ""This is a moment I've dreamed about since I've been a kid, running around the backyard pretending to be Doug Flutie, pretending I was throwing Hail Marys to my dad,"" Manziel said, gesturing to Flutie, the former Boston College quarterback who was onstage with other previous Heisman winners. ""It's such an honor to represent Texas A&M and my teammates here tonight,"" he told the audience at the Best Buy Theater in New York. ""I wish they could be on the stage with me."" He bested a field of finalists that included Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te'o and Kansas State quarterback Collin Klein. Roland Martin: The legend of ""Johnny Football"" grows . Manziel amassed 43 touchdowns rushing and passing this year, and his 4,600 yards smashed the Southeastern Conference record for total offense. But beyond the numbers, what put Manziel on the map was his play in Texas A&M's improbable November win against Alabama, ranked No.1 in the nation at the time. The Aggies were thought not to have much chance of success in the first season in the SEC, but largely because of Manziel's play, they finished the regular season 10-2 and will be playing Oklahoma in the Cotton Bowl on January 4. In smashing through the underclassman barrier, Manziel achieved a feat that eluded past freshman stars Georgia's Herschel Walker, Virginia Tech's Michael Vick and Oklahoma's Adrian Peterson. Walker (1980) and Vick (1999) both came in third in Heisman voting as freshmen, and Peterson (2004) finished second. (Walker did go on to win the trophy as a junior, in 1982.) Manziel received 474 first-place votes, cast by past winners and members of the media, to 321 for Te'o and 60 for Klein. Other vote-getters were Southern Cal wide receiver Marquis Lee and Ohio State quarterback Braxton Miller. Like the freshman Manziel, the other two finalists represented potential firsts among Heisman winners: Te'o would have been the first exclusively defensive player to win the trophy and Klein the first Kansas State player.

"(Mental Floss)  -- Some companies find their niche and stick to it. Others, though, have to adapt to changing markets in order to thrive. Here's a look at some companies that switched industries at some point in their histories, usually for the better. Tiffany's may know how to prettily wrap jewelry because the company began in the paper business. 1. Avon . David H. McConnell started Avon in 1886 without really meaning to. McConnell sold books door-to-door, but to lure in female customers he offered little gifts of perfume. Before long, the perfume McConnell was giving away had become more popular than the books he was selling, so he shifted focus and founded the California Perfume Company, which later became Avon. 2. Nokia . The telecom giant got its start in Finland in 1865, when Fredrik Idestam opened a pulp mill and started making paper on the banks of Tammerkoski. The company later bounced around a number of industries before getting serious about phones in the 1960s. 3. 3M . When the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company's founders opened their business in Two Harbors, Minnesota, in 1902, they weren't selling Post-It Notes. The partners originally planned to sell the mineral corundum, an important ingredient in building grinding wheels, directly to manufacturers. 4. Berkshire Hathaway . The sprawling holding company helmed by Warren Buffett was originally a textile manufacturer that took off in 1839. Buffett took control in 1962, though, and by 1967 he started to move outside of textiles into insurance and other sectors. Mental Floss: Ginsu Knives, Dairy Queen and what else Warren Buffett owns . 5. Wrigley . Like Avon, the chewing gum company got its start with a popular freebie. William Wrigley, Jr. founded the company in 1891 with the goal of selling soap and baking powder. He offered chewing gum as an enticement to his customers, and eventually the customers didn't care about the baking powder; they only wanted the gum. 6. Tiffany & Co. The jewelry and silverware hot bed was originally a stationer called Tiffany, Young, and Ellis when it started in 1837. In 1853 Tiffany switched its core business and began focusing on jewelry. 7. Coleco . The defunct electronics corporation actually began as a leather goods company in Connecticut in 1932. In the early days it was known as the Connecticut Leather Company, which was later shortened to ""Coleco."" 8. Hasbro . The company behind Transformers and G.I. Joes began in 1923 as Hassenfeld Brothers. The titular brothers didn't make toys, though; they sold textile remnants. Their business gradually shifted into school supplies before making the leap to toys after the 1952 introduction of Mr. Potato Head. Mental Floss: How 10 classic toys were invented . 9. Raytheon . The defense contractor started up in 1922 as the American Appliance Company, which worked on refrigeration technology. Eventually the company branched out into other areas of electronics and became Raytheon in 1925. 10. Colgate . The hygienic products company got its start in 1806, but it didn't make its first toothpaste until 1873. Founder William Colgate initially manufactured soap, candles, and starch. 11. Xerox . When Xerox got off the ground in 1906, it was as a maker of photographic paper and photography equipment called the Haloid Company. The company didn't introduce what we would think of as a copier until the Xerox 914 made its debut in 1959. 12. John Deere . The man behind the giant fleet of green tractors got his start as a blacksmith in Grand Detour, Illinois. After struggling to make plows that could cut through the area's tough clay, Deere hit on the idea of building plows out of cast steel, and his blacksmith gig gave way to a booming farm-supply business. 13. Reading Entertainment . Remember the Reading Railroad from the last time you played Monopoly? The company still (sort of) exists! The Reading Company got out of the railroad business in 1976 but was reborn as Reading Entertainment, which operates movie theaters mainly in Australia, New Zealand, and the U.S. Mental Floss: 11 things Wal-Mart has banned . 14. Abercrombie & Fitch . When David Abercrombie founded the clothing store in 1892 in New York City, he wasn't dreaming of clothing high school and college students everywhere. The store was originally a sporting goods shop and outfitter; Abercrombie even outfitted Charles Lindbergh for his famous flight across the Atlantic.

"Manila, Philippines (CNN) -- The death toll from twin typhoons that pounded the Philippines has reached 59, authorities said. Typhoon Nesat -- known locally as Pedring -- has claimed 55 lives, and the death toll from Nalgae -- known locally as Quiel -- rose to four Monday as rescuers found the body of a man who drowned in raging floodwaters in Bulacan province. Several towns in Bulacan and Pampanga provinces, in Central Luzon, were under chest-deep water when continuous rains from Typhoon Nesat last week prompted the release of water from four dams around the area. Among the worst hit was the city of Calumpit, Bulacan, where residents were stranded on rooftops for days. Although floodwaters have begun to subside, hundreds of families remained in evacuation centers as more than 43,000 houses were damaged by Typhoon Nesat alone, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said. It estimated damages to infrastructure and agriculture at more than 8 billion Philippine pesos (almost $183 million). Several dikes have also been breached in Pampanga province during Typhoon Nesat. Typhoon Nalgae, which made a landfall on Saturday morning, aggravated the damage from Nesat as it cut a swath of destruction along the upper regions of Luzon island, directly hitting the crop-producing provinces of Isabela and Cagayan as well as the Cordilleras. Landslides from Typhoon Nalgae cut off portions of a major highway, isolating the town of Carranglan in Nueva Ecija. A passenger van headed toward Bontoc, Mountain Province, encountered a landslide along the Halsema Highway, resulting to the death of one person, the disaster agency said. By Monday afternoon, Nalgae had weakened to a tropical storm. But Nalgae still threatened to bring heavy rainfall and strong winds to China's Hainan island on Tuesday and is expected to dump heavy rain on coastal Guangxi province in the next two days, the state-run Xinhua news agency said. CNN's Ivan Cabrera contributed to this report.","NEW: Nalgae, now a tropical storm, threatens southern China .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility Saturday for a blast that killed seven people, including three children, during a Shiite religious procession. The bomb was planted in a garbage container in the central Pakistani city of Dera Ismail Khan and exploded as the last section of the procession, in which children were following adults, was passing by, police spokesman Khalid Sohail said. Eighteen people, including five children and two police officials, were wounded in the attack. The spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, Ihsanullah Ihsan, said the group would continue ""its mission"" and attack Shiite Ashura processions across Pakistan. Pakistan is on high alert because of the two-day high holy Shiite holiday of Ashura, in which believers mourn the death of a key imam from the seventh century. Taliban claim blasts killing dozens in Pakistan . Shia Islam is a minority sect in the mainly Sunni Muslim country, and its members face persecution from extremists. The Pakistani Taliban took responsibility for similar attacks earlier this week. The government increased security for the Ashura observance, which ends Saturday. Interior Minister Rehman Malik temporarily blocked cell phone services in cities, where gathered intelligence indicated the possibility of bombs detonated by cell phone. He also banned motor bikes, often used to conceal bombs, for two days in some cities. Malik said the safeguards were specifically meant to protect Shiites. Pakistan Taliban threaten to target India after execution of Mumbai attacker . At least 31 people were killed and 68 wounded in multiple bomb attacks Wednesday despite heightened security. A Tehrik-i-Taliban spokesman said those attacks targeted Shiites, who the terrorists believe denigrate the Prophet Mohammed with their religious observance. Ashura commemorates the death of the Prophet Mohammed's grandson, killed in the Battle of Karbala in 680 AD. The battle and subsequent death of Imam Hussein caused the split between Shiite and Sunni Muslims.","NEW: The Pakistani Taliban claim responsibity for the blast .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- An Israeli think tank with close links to the government has simulated what would happen in the Mideast and internationally if Israel attacked Iran's nuclear facilities -- and concluded that reaction would be ""in the direction of containment and restraint,"" not the trigger for a larger war. The Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) says it held a ""war game"" several weeks ago -- when ""it appeared that the fall of 2012 would be a critical period"" -- simulating the initial ramifications of Israeli airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. ""This sense of an imminent decision has since abated somewhat, but after the U.S. and Israeli elections, the question of an attack will undoubtedly resurface,"" the think tank says in a report published this week in its online ""INSS Insights."" For its war game, INSS used ex-Israeli diplomats and military officials who played different roles, such as pretending to be the heads of state from Israel, the United States, Russia and Iran, reacting to developments in the first 48 hours after such an attack. The war game was planned and enacted in September -- the same month that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on the United Nations General Assembly to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons, holding up a picture of a spherical bomb and drawing a red line below the fuse. In the Institute for National Security Studies' scenario, Israel informs the United States of its attack plan after its planes are in the air, but the United States later ""stood by Israel's side and did not expose its differences in opinion with Israel,"" the think tank said in its summary of the simulation. While some analysts predict ""the outbreak of World War III"" after such an attack, the think tank said the September simulation aimed for a different approach: ""containment and restraint."" ""The intention was not to predict developments, rather to examine the significance and implications of one possible scenario,"" the think tank said. ""The players acted very rationally, demonstrating preventive policies and motivated by crucial interests alone."" The Israeli Institute for National Security Studies is based at Tel Aviv University and describes itself on its website as an independent, nonpartisan academic institute but adds that it has ""a strong association with the political and military establishment"" in Israel. The think tank's analysis of its simulation doesn't go into details about how Barack Obama or Mitt Romney might respond as U.S. president if Israel attacked Iranian nuclear sites. Iran insists that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but the program came up in last month's final presidential debate between the two candidates. ""As long as I'm president of the United States, Iran will not get a nuclear weapon. I made that clear when I came into office,"" Obama said. Romney also said a nuclear-capable Iran was unacceptable, and said he would support tighter sanctions. ""We need to increase pressure time and time again on Iran because anything other than a solution to this ... which stops this nuclear folly of theirs, is unacceptable to America. And of course, a military action is the last resort. It is something one would only consider if all of the other avenues had been tried to their full extent,"" the Republican presidential candidate said. Both candidates said the United States would stand by Israel if that country is attacked. CNN's Michael Schwartz and Catherine Shoichet contributed to this report.","The think tank has close links to Israel's government and military .

"Washington (CNN) -- About half the schools in Tennessee didn't meet the annual yearly progress requirements of the No Child Left Behind law last year. Tennessee is not alone. Saying schools are struggling to meet the student progress requirements of the No Child Left Behind law, the White House announced Monday it would be signing waivers that will relieve schools of some of the key provisions of the law. ""The law -- No Child Left Behind -- as it currently stands is four years overdue for being rewritten. It is far too punitive, it is far too prescriptive, lead to a dummying down of standards, lead to a narrowing of the curriculum,"" Education Secretary Arne Duncan said at a White House press briefing on Monday. ""We can't afford to have the law of the land be one that has so many perverse incentives or disincentives to the kind of progress that we want to see."" The law requires that all students meet reading and math adequacy by 2014. If they don't, the schools are subject to reforms. As the standards have increased annually, schools are finding it increasingly difficult to meet them. ""We hope that this is simply a transition or bridge to fixing the law,"" Duncan said of the waiver plans. Rather than a large sweeping bill to reauthorize the entire Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), also known as No Child Left Behind Act, Rep. John Kline's committee has been working on smaller, more specific bills throughout the summer, to address ESEA concerns. The Republican-led House Education and the Workforce committee has passed three bills intended to streamline education programs, address charter school issues and give states and localities more flexibility in spending their federal dollars. These bills have not yet made it to the House floor for debate, nor have they come up in the Democratic-led Senate for debate. Only one of the bills -- the one on charter schools -- passed out of the House committee with bipartisan support. The committee is expected to take up separate legislation on teacher effectiveness and accountability this fall. ""I remain concerned that temporary measures instituted by the Department (of Education), such as conditional waivers, could undermine the committee's efforts to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act,"" Kline, R-Minnesota, said in a statement Friday. Duncan said the Education Department will announce the standards under which the waivers will be granted in September but in the meantime, they encourage all states to apply. Duncan said he had talked to more than 30 governors about the waiver plan. ""I have not spoken to one governor that wasn't very enthusiastic about this,"" he said. Tennessee applied for a waiver to the law late last month, according to Kelli Gauthier of the Department of Education there. Without a waiver, Tennessee would be ""responsible for intervening in a large number of its 'failing' schools; a role the department has neither the desire nor the capacity to take on,"" according to Gauthier. Tennessee is still waiting to see if Secretary Duncan approves their request.","Education Secretary Duncan hopes this is transition to fix for law .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani Taliban on Tuesday claimed responsibility for a foiled plot to assassinate a high-profile television journalist by planting a bomb on his car. Hamid Mir, a senior anchor on Geo TV's prime time programming, escaped the attempt on his life Monday when the bomb was found attached to the back of his car and disabled before it could cause any harm. Read more: Who are the Pakistani Taliban? ""We will continue targeting journalists who propagate a secular agenda and side with the government,"" Ihsanullah Ihsan, a spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, said by telephone Tuesday. Mir said he had gone to a busy market place in the heart of Islamabad ""to run some errands"" on Monday when the bomb was detected. A police officer in Mir's security team saw a plastic bag containing half a kilo (about a pound) of explosives attached to the car and called the bomb disposal squad, which successfully defused the device, said Bin Yamin, the Islamabad police chief. Read more: Girl's courage, Taliban's cowardice . Despite the brush with danger, Mir remained defiant following the incident in a country that is fraught with risk for journalists. ""I want to give those responsible a message,"" he said in an interview with Geo TV. ""I want to say that as long as I have life in my body and blood in my veins I will not stop telling the truth."" He said the assassination attempt ""is a message not just to me but to Geo TV and the entire journalist community."" Pakistan is frequently cited by press freedom advocacy groups as being among the most deadly countries in the world from which to report. Danger can come from militant organizations -- like the Taliban, who threatened journalists for their coverage of the attack on the teenage education activist Malala Yousufzai -- and also from government agencies, the advocacy groups say. ""We have a lot of respect for journalists, however all those who are spreading negative news against us and Islam will be targeted,"" Ihsan, the Taliban spokesman, said Tuesday. The Pakistani Taliban, who are closely linked with their namesake in Afghanistan and with al Qaeda, operate in the ungoverned area that sits on the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan. Police say they are investigating the assassination attempt. The Islamabad bureau chief of Geo TV, Rana Jawed, said that he thought the bomb plot had been carried out by group with expertise in such attacks. ""Somebody must have followed Mir's car, and when he got a chance he must have attached the bomb,"" Jawed said. He said the bomb had not gone off because it was ""faulty.""","NEW: The Pakistani Taliban say they planted the bomb .

"Khartoum, Sudan (CNN) -- Final results of last month's referendum show an overwhelming majority of southern Sudanese voted to split from the north, a result that will lead to the creation of the world's newest nation, the referendum commission said Monday. The chairman of the Southern Sudan Referendum Commission, which organized the vote and includes members from both sides, said 98.83% voted for separation, while 1.17% voted for unity. ""It was a peaceful process,"" chairman Muhammad Ibrahim Khalil said at a ceremony in Khartoum attended by Sudanese politicians, international diplomats, U.N. staff, academics and others. ""It was a transparent process."" ""Not a single person"" showed up to appeal the results, he said. Preliminary results had shown overwhelming support for separation. The commission met Monday with Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and First Vice President Salva Kiir to present the final results, state TV reported earlier. Al-Bashir has stated his commitment to the results and said he will accept them, state TV said. As a result of the government's acceptance of the results, the United States is beginning the process of removing Sudan from its list of state sponsors of terrorism, U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Monday. U.S. President Barack Obama announced Washington's intention to recognize Southern Sudan as a sovereign, independent state in July, when a comprehensive peace agreement with the north is due to end. ""After decades of conflict, the images of millions of southern Sudanese voters deciding their own future was an inspiration to the world and another step forward in Africa's long journey toward justice and democracy,"" Obama said in a statement. ""Now, all parties have a responsibility to ensure that this historic moment of promise becomes a moment of lasting progress.  The Comprehensive Peace Agreement must be fully implemented and outstanding disputes must be resolved peacefully."" Obama promised the United States would support the governments of both Sudan and Southern Sudan to ensure a smooth and peaceful transition to independence. Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain -- which ruled Sudan between 1899 and 1955 -- said he welcomed the Khartoum government's positive reaction to the results and said the United Kingdom would support the country's new chapter. ""It is a happy day for southern Sudanese,"" said Louis Makor, 40, an activist from the south.  ""We have gained our rights, our self-determination, and I hope the best for both southern and northern Sudanese. And we will remain brothers."" Those in the north had more varied opinions. ""I think it is better,"" said Abd al-Aziz Ahmad, 30, a grocery store owner. ""They can have their own country, and our problem in the north will lessen."" Northerner Al-Razy Yassin, 27, however, said he felt very sad about the outcome. ""I believed that our strength is in our diversity,"" he said. ""This means the failure of the Sudanese national state, and I fear what might come."" There were tears on the face of Ikhlas Garang, a woman who is half northern and half southern, who cried, ""Why are we separating? Why are we separating?"" Sudan's north and south fought a war for more than two decades, finally ending in a peace treaty in 2005 that paved the way for the referendum. The conflict, which left 2 million people dead, pitted a government dominated by Arab Muslims in northern Sudan against black Christians and animists in the south. A majority of Sudan's oil reserves are in the south, which was another flashpoint in the war. Several million voters, including expatriates in the United States and seven other countries, cast ballots. Before Southern Sudan can become independent, the two sides still have to address various issues including currency, citizenship, national debt, and how to divide the majority of oil reserves found in the south. The Abyei region -- which straddles the border between the regions -- remains a disputed area between the two sides. And as the world's newest nation, Southern Sudan would face daunting obstacles. There is a desperate need for development in the south and a lack of a robust educated class to control the new levers of power. A flood of refugees, eagerly returning to an independent homeland, could complicate matters in a place that already lacks enough schools and clinics and has few paved roads. Longstanding grievances among rival southern groups could erupt in violence; several hundred southerners already have been killed in such fighting in the last year or two. Or the north could refuse to accept the results or stir tensions by trying to pit one southern faction against another. The concerns run so deep that a year ago, Dennis Blair, then the U.S. director of national intelligence, warned the U.S. Congress of possible genocide. ""A number of countries in Africa and Asia are at significant risk for a new outbreak of mass killing"" in the next five years, he said. ""Among these countries, a new mass killing or genocide is most likely to occur in Southern Sudan."" Al-Bashir, wanted for war crimes after mass killings and rape in the country's western Darfur region, has said a southern vote for independence would be like ""cutting off a part of the nation's body, but not the end of the world."" Still, al-Bashir has said he won't hesitate to accept the results, because peace with the south is the ultimate goal. People in Southern Sudan have long felt dominated by the north, ever since slave-raiding parties from the region penetrated the south around 1840. The raids instilled a collective hostility toward northerners that successive generations in the south nursed until they erupted in open war. When it ruled Sudan, Britain administered north and south as separate entities, preventing travel from one region to the other. The imbalance that resulted sparked southern fears of northern domination when the British announced plans to leave. Southerners took up arms against the north in August 1955, six months before Sudan's independence. Most jobs in the new national government went to people from the north, which also dominated the process of drafting a constitution. The insurgency that started in 1955 killed several hundred thousand people and forced many more from their homes, until a peace deal silenced the guns in 1972. Barely a decade later, though, war resumed after the Sudanese president split the south into three regions and sought to impose Islamic law on non-Muslims. The 1989 coup that brought al-Bashir to power let him steer the ship of state by the compass of Islamic extremism. He praised the 1979 Iranian revolution and offered shelter to many groups the United States views as terrorist organizations. Osama bin Laden arrived in Sudan in 1991, long before he became a household name. The United States added Sudan to its list of state sponsors of terrorism two years later. Peace talks to end the war were well under way in 2003 when a mostly unrelated conflict erupted in the western Sudanese region of Darfur. Marginalized non-Arab Muslims there rebelled against the government by attacking a military garrison. The Sudanese government responded by arming and cooperating with Arab militias that killed, tortured and raped thousands, mainly targeting tribes from which the rebels drew strength, according to the United Nations, Western governments and human rights organizations. The United Nations says 300,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million displaced in Darfur, though the government of Sudan says the toll is lower. Al-Bashir's role in Darfur led the International Criminal Court to indict him in 2009 on accusations of war crimes. Even as the killing continued unabated in Darfur, al-Bashir's government made progress in negotiations with southern rebels. That progress resulted in a landmark agreement in January 2005 between the Sudanese government and the main rebel group in the south, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement. The Comprehensive Peace Agreement called for the referendum that took place last month. Journalist Isma'il Kushkush in Khartoum and CNN's Aliza Kassim and Mark Bixler in Atlanta contributed to this report.","The final results of January's vote were announced Monday .

"(CNN) -- Gas prices have plummeted 46 cents a gallon over the past two months, according to a survey released Sunday. ""This has been a true price crash,"" said Trilby Lundberg, publisher of the Lundberg Survey. The average price of a gallon of regular gasoline is $3.38, down nearly a dime over the past three weeks, Lundberg said. ""This crash began back when refining problems around the country were being fixed, one after the other, at the same time that our seasonal gasoline demand was shrinking,"" she said. Crude oil prices have also dropped after having risen steadily. Prices at the pump should drop even more in the coming days, as refiners cut how much they're charging distributors and retailers, Lundberg said. The national average is about 8 cents higher than the average a year ago. The survey tallies prices at thousands of gas stations nationwide. Long Island, New York, had the highest average in the latest survey, at $3.85. The lowest average was in Memphis, Tennessee, at $3.04. Here are average prices in some other cities: . • Boston - $3.59 . • Baltimore - $3.34 . • Atlanta - $3.27 . • Baton Rouge, Louisiana• - $3.11 . • St. Louis - $3.05 . • Salt Lake City - $3.40 . • Los Angeles - $3.68 .","Fixed refining problems, shrinking demand, lower crude oil prices bring gas prices down .

"(CNN) -- ""It's like all our memories are gone."" That's what my brother said when he called to talk about the devastation Superstorm Sandy wreaked on the Jersey Shore, the summer playground of our youth. With those words I realized that as concerned and sad as I was about the effect of the storm, I was also mourning for a place that harbored so many happy memories for me growing up that may never be the same. My brother still lives in the Northeast, but I have long since moved to Atlanta and married a woman from Siesta Key, Florida. For vacations, we venture out to exotic spots. But the word ""vacation"" always conjures up images of the Jersey Shore in my mind, and I have often found it difficult to communicate to my wife and my Southern friends what an important cultural touchstone the Jersey Shore is for people in that region. All they know is the caricatured version presented by MTV. But for tens of millions of people in greater New York and Philadelphia who live a short drive or train ride away, the Jersey Shore has always been a weekend destination where families vacation year after year. New York after Sandy: A tale of two cities . It was not a coastline of resorts and golf courses, like so much of the South. It was grid-based towns that went right up to the beach and were capped off with boardwalks that stretched for miles. Back home in Pennsylvania, we all knew those towns. We knew which had the best piers with the best rides, and we knew that the best sausage and pepper sandwich was at a boardwalk stand in Seaside Heights. We knew that Lucy the Elephant was actually a hotel in Margate and that the places on the Monopoly board really existed. We also knew that ""the Shore"" meant only the Jersey Shore. Everywhere else was just the beach. But the shore was more than just a beach. It was carnival rides and boardwalks and the remnants of what entertainment looked like in the Victorian era. It was the birthplace of Miss America and the land of Springsteen. It was beach towns filled with memories made by generations of families. My grandparents were the first ones in my family who were born in America, and for them and every generation in my family, our first encounter with the ocean was at the Jersey Shore. As a result, I was able to do some of the same things in the same places my grandmother did, when as a young woman she would take the train from Philadelphia to Atlantic City with her girlfriends to frolic in the sand and walk the boardwalk. I could hang out on the beach and wander around the sights in Cape May, just like my mom did. It is a connection that binds generations. It was to the Jersey Shore that my brother and our high school friends went the day after senior proms, just like our dad did. And we both agree our best family vacation ever was in Lavallette in 1977, when he was 12 and I was 10. So many of our friends were there at the same time, and we could finally hang out on the boardwalk on our own. I loved it so much I vowed I would keep forever a T-shirt I got at a boat race we attended that week. And I have. It is now my 9-year-old son's favorite T-shirt and his special connection to the Jersey Shore. Entertainment: 'Jersey Shore' cast on Sandy devastation . When you are married to someone who grew up on an island with palm trees, it is hard to convince them the Jersey Shore is a worthy alternative. But I finally convinced my wife to go there for a family reunion when she was newly pregnant with our first child. We arrived when it was dark, and the cool, late summer air was damp with the ocean spray. I insisted that she walk up to the beach with me, and when we got there we turned, looked north and I showed her the boardwalk pier stretching out over the water, with a Ferris wheel and a roller coaster lighting up the night sky over the black ocean. I stood behind her, with my arms wrapped around her shoulders, and sang in a whisper into her ear: ""The amusement park rises bold and stark; kids are huddled on the beach in the mist."" I could finally show her that place was real. And that imagery was the imagery of my memories. And my parents' memories . . . and their parents' memories. And that was my Jersey Shore.

"(CNN) -- Republicans are consoling themselves with the claim that President Barack Obama didn't win a mandate Tuesday night, even if he did renew his White House lease for another four years. They are fooling themselves, however, if they think the 2012 election merely ratified the political status quo. More than just a personal victory for Obama, the outcome was an unmistakable defeat for GOP ideology. Disgruntled conservatives, of course, are already dressing Mitt Romney for the part of fall guy. But this is the politics of evasion. Sooner or later, GOP realists will have to reappraise the party's message rather than shoot its messenger. That message was a call for rolling back government. Intoxicated by a potent brew of resurgent libertarian dogma and intense personal animus toward Obama, Republicans vowed to undo his major achievements: health care reform, new rules for financial markets, the regulation of carbon emissions, higher fuel economy standards for autos, and so on. Conservatives also railed against an alleged epidemic of dependency on government; called for deep spending cuts (but no tax hikes) to reduce public deficits; threatened to roll back women's reproductive rights; and took extreme positions on tax, immigration and energy issues that seemed calculated to thwart bipartisan compromise. Such tea party radicalism seemed to work in 2010, amid acute public dissatisfaction with the slow pace of economic recovery. But a different electorate -- larger, more moderate and more Democratic -- rejected the conservative vision this time. In effect, the pragmatic center reasserted itself on Tuesday. According to exit polls, a plurality of voters, 41%, were moderates, and they favored Obama by 15 points. In general, voters viewed Obama as more for the middle class and Republicans as tilting toward the interests of the rich. They did not accept Romney's claims that Obama has been an incompetent economic manager; nearly half the voters instead blamed the weak economy on his predecessor. Opinion: Obama's critics, repudiated at last . And for all the GOP's ceaseless demonization of Obamacare, the issue seemed to work in the president's favor. Exit polls say health care registered as the voters' second most important concern (albeit a distant second to the economy and jobs). Obama won massively among these voters, which suggests that Republican promises to kill health care reform may have backfired by spurring greater intensity among its advocates. Some Republicans point hopefully to the fact that the election barely changed the existing composition of political forces in Washington. That's true, but this was an election they could have won. With stubbornly high unemployment and the president's low approval ratings (often below the previously supposed ""can't win"" threshold of 50%), the Republicans had objective reality on their side. Instead, they blew it by indulging in pathological partisanship and ideological hubris. The big question now is whether Republicans will accept the lessons of their defeat or take refuge in the usual alibis. The biggest lesson, of course, is they lost because they picked the wrong candidate -- a Massachusetts moderate who didn't given the country a clear choice between undiluted conservatism and Obama's alleged ultra-liberalism. This electoral math is no better than Romney's budget math. America may list slightly to the center-right, but no party can cede the center and win. What Republicans really need is an analogue to the New Democrat movement of the 1990s -- a determined effort by moderates and pragmatists to reassert control over their party's agenda and electoral strategies. Whether they realize that is another matter: Democrats had to lose four out of five presidential elections between 1968 and 1992 before finally accepting that their message could no longer command electoral majorities. Opinion: Obama will get little time to celebrate . Republicans don't have that luxury. Tuesday's results made it blindingly obvious that the GOP's political strategy of relying almost exclusively on white voters already has reached a dead end. As expected, white turnout was 72%, according to exit polls, two points down from 2008, and is projected to be two points lower in 2016. The GOP's bet on a kind of white identity politics -- which dates back to Ronald Reagan's successful 1966 run for governor in California and was ruthlessly perfected by Richard Nixon in 1972 -- is played out. Meanwhile, what the National Journal's Ronald Brownstein calls the Democrats' ""coalition of the ascendant"" is growing by about the same amount every four years. This coalition includes minorities, young voters and women (especially single women), along with highly educated white professionals. As they pore over election returns, expect GOP strategists to look especially ruefully at Latino voters. Obama won them by 71% to 27%, according to exit polls, improving on his 2008 performance. Assuming that Latinos would focus mainly on their economic struggles and ignore the GOP's harshly anti-immigrant stance, proved to be a major miscalculation. A conservative governing philosophy centered on exploiting white voters' sense of cultural dispossession is a formula for political marginalization, if not demographic suicide. Any honest post-mortem of the 2012 election should lead Republican strategists to this inescapable conclusion: It's the ideology, stupid. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Will Marshall.","Obama's re-election was an unmistakable defeat for GOP ideology, says Will Marshall .

"(CNN) -- Scientists in the Arctic have discovered the largest ever under-ice bloom of phytoplankton, likening the discovery to ""finding the Amazon rainforest in the middle of the Mojave Desert."" Researchers were amazed to discover a colossal 100 kilometer (62 miles) stretch of phytoplankton blooming under Arctic ice, north of Alaska, in July last year. It had previously been assumed that sea ice blocked the sunlight necessary for the growth of marine plants. But four times more phytoplankton was found under the ice than in ice-free waters nearby. Scientists now believe that pools of melting ice actually function like skylights and magnifying glasses, focusing sunlight into sea water, providing the perfect conditions for the intense phytoplankton bloom, which makes the water look like pea soup. Undiscovered until the 1970s, the ocean's phytoplankton is now understood to be responsible for about as much of the oxygen in our atmosphere as plants on land. The ecological consequences of the polar bloom are not yet fully understood but given phytoplankton's position at the base of the food chain, it is expected to have implications for ocean animals that feed in the area. It was a serendipitous discovery for scientists who, as part of NASA's ICESCAPE program, were studying the impact of climate change in the Chukchi sea, where melt season changes are pronounced. Making their way through meter-thick ice aboard the U.S. Coast Guard's largest icebreaker Healy in July last year, scientists observed surprising amounts of fluorescing chlorophyll, indicating the presence of photosynthesizing plant life. Tide turns towards undersea energy . ""If someone had asked me before the expedition whether we would see under-ice blooms, I would have told them it was impossible,"" said ICESCAPE mission leader Kevin Arrigo of Stanford University, at a press conference announcing the publication of findings in ""Science"" this month. ""This discovery was a complete surprise."" Donald Perovich, a U.S. Army geophysicist who studied the ice's optical properties, described the under-ice area as looking ""like a photographic negative"". ""Beneath the bare-ice areas that reflect a lot of sunlight, it was dark. Under the melt ponds, it was very bright,"" he said. The melt pools were found to let in four times as much light as snow-covered ice. Protected from ultraviolet rays, phytoplankton grows twice as fast under-ice as in the open ocean. Using an automated microscope system called an Imaging FlowCytobot, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution biologist Sam Laney took millions of photographs of the phytoplankton organisms, some of which he also found in brine channels inside the ice. Antarctic ice shelves 'tearing apart', says study . The type of phytoplankton found near coasts can bloom rapidly when there are changes to the amounts of light and nutrients available. Some blooms are toxic for humans and marine life. If the Arctic sea ice continues to thin, blooms might become more widespread and appear earlier, which could pose problems for migrating birds and whales, said Arrigo. ""It could make it harder and harder for migratory species to time their life cycles to be in the Arctic when the bloom is at its peak,"" he said. ""If their food supply is coming earlier, they might be missing the boat."" ""At this point we don't know whether these rich phytoplankton blooms have been happening in the Arctic for a long time, and we just haven't observed them before,"" he said.","A NASA expedition has discovered a huge phytoplankton bloom under Arctic ice .
Scientists say melting ice pools function as skylights, enabling under-ice photosynthesis .
The timing of such blooms could affect migratory species' feeding cycles ."
"(CNN) -- They say football can take over your life and now German Bundesliga side FC Schalke 04 have taken that adage to its extremes. Schalke fans have long filled Germany's leading football arenas with the chant ""Ein Leben lang, Blau und WeiÃŸ ein Leben lang"" (""a lifelong blue and white"") but now, the club has ensured that such devotion can officially last a lifetime -- and beyond. For devotees of the side lying second in the Bundesliga and currently topping their European Champions League group can, from next month onwards, be laid to rest in a cemetery specifically made for Schalke fans -- one which lies in sight of the team's Veltins-Arena home in Gelsenkirchen. ""You can start your life with Schalke 04 by getting baptized, you can get married at the stadium and now you can be buried at the Schalke cemetery,"" Schalke's public relations officer Sonja Berger told CNN. ""The Schalke cemetery is a unique project and as far as we know there is nothing comparable in Europe."" The rising fortunes of the Royal Blues have been assisted in recent years by signings of the caliber of former Real Madrid star Raul Gonzalez and current Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, with Schalke having achieved four second-place finishes in the Bundesliga since the turn of the century and reached the last four of the Champions League in 2011. Off the pitch, the club has also been growing. Three years ago, Schalke opened a delivery room in the maternity wing of a hospital close to the Veltins-Arena, so that newborns can enter the world in a room with blue and white coloring and where Schalke logos and images adorn the walls. With the club also providing baptisms and weddings, the introduction of the cemetery project -- which is known as the Schalke Fan Feld -- takes the array of services offered by the club into the afterlife as well. However, adverse weather conditions have delayed the opening of the historic cemetery -- which features 1,904 plots in commemoration of the year the club was founded -- until the middle of December but fans are already snapping up the limited places. Given that the team with seven championship crowns (albeit with the last dating back to 1958) has long been one of Germany's most popular sides, plots at a stadium-shaped cemetery -- which will be bedecked in blue-and-white flowers surrounding a tiny rectangular ""pitch"" featuring two goals and a floral Schalke emblem -- may not last long with over 100 having already been taken. This is despite a cost of $6,639 (5,406 Euros), a price which does not benefit the Bundesliga club itself but which does guarantee 25 years of grave maintenance, as provided by a company headed up by local real estate agent, and former Schalke trialist, Ender Ulupinar. With no current plans to extend the one-off project beyond the 1,904 graves available, the Schalke cemetery -- which lies within the city's larger Beckhausen-Sutum cemetery -- will have a certain exclusivity, and one family have already decided to move a late relative's remains from his initial resting place to this new home. Plots to have already gone include number 04, for obvious reasons, and number 215 which has been allocated to a fan who wanted it in memory of Schalke's leading European triumph in 1997, with the club winning the now-defunct UEFA Cup on 21 May -- or 21/5. ""For a normal person, I think this decision is insane -- but not for me. I have supported Schalke for almost 26 years now so for me, it's just an additional way of showing my support. Either you are a really huge fan or just a fair-weather fan -- I am a really huge supporter, I love my club and think it's a good idea,"" Arthur Gore, who is just 34, told CNN. ""You pay for the care, so no one needs to care for the grave, and for me, it's like a pioneering project as well, so I am really proud of it. Schalke is part of the culture in Gelsenkirchen because after the mines were closed in our city, there has been a lot of unemployment. ""Without Schalke, there wouldn't be anything here and the opinion of many people, not just myself, is that the city lives from the club."" When asked whether he had made provision for any future family members, the unmarried sales manager laughed freely before admitting it was a topic he had given little thought to. ""These are questions I haven't thought about yet but I do have a girlfriend. I told her I had bought her a grave but she looked surprised -- as she is not a football fan, she doesn't really get it,"" replied Gore, who says he was attracted by the ""unique"" nature of the offer. ""One of my married friends also wants to buy a plot and I think his wife will understand as she knows that when she married, she married Schalke as well. Otherwise, I am not sure the marriage would work as being a die-hard supporter, which includes traveling the country, takes up a lot of time."" Despite the high cost, Gore is convinced a number of Schalke fans are so devoted to the club that many will soon embark on setting funds aside to buy a plot in future. Meanwhile, Ulupinar -- whose wife runs a cemetery garden business -- says the idea came to him after noticing a mix of Schalke pennants, flags, season tickets, player photos and blue-and-white flowers were already decorating hundreds of gravestones in the western city of Gelsenkirchen. ""The feedback has been very good, not just in terms of the number of graves already taken up, which we didn't expect to be so high, but also in terms of the fan and media interest too -- and it hasn't only come from Schalke followers either, but other supporters too,"" says Ulupinar, 39. ""There has been some criticism though, with some people feeling it is not Christian to designate an area of the cemetery for people of a certain, and smaller, group. But on the whole, people like the idea."" Helpfully for Ulupinar, Hans-Joachim Dohm, a retired pastor and Schalke fan himself, has countered the protests by saying that dozens of supporters had been requesting a special final home with links to the club for a number of years. Schalke are not the first football club to open a cemetery for their fans, with Argentina's Boca Juniors having created one with 3,000 plots in 2007 while South Africa's Kaizer Chiefs have entered the market in different fashion, offering fans a Funeral Plan which effectively serves as a life insurance policy.","FC Schalke 04 to open stadium shaped cemetery for club's fans from next month .

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo could be forgiven for feeling a sense of deja vu after he was pitted against chief rival Lionel Messi of Barcelona in the race for football's prestigious Ballon d'Or. The pair will go up against Messi's Spanish teammate Andres Iniesta after the original shortlist was whittled down from 23 to three. The trophy will be presented in Zurich on January 7 following votes from journalists, national team captains and coaches. Magic Messi moves in on record . Messi, the darling of the football world, has won the top accolade on the previous three occasions and could become the first man to win the prize four times. While Real Madrid star Ronaldo amassed an astonishing 46 goals in La Liga last year, Messi scaled unprecedented heights by finishing with 50 goals in the league alone. The 25-year-old is now chasing Gerd Muller's all-time record of 85 goals in a calendar year, which the former Bayern Munich and Germany striker set back in 1972. Messi needs just four more strikes to surpass Muller's record and rewrite yet another chapter of European football. Cristiano Ronaldo and Daniel Craig - A right to privacy? But Portugal's Ronaldo, who won the prize in 2008, enjoyed an outstanding year, firing Real to the La Liga title under new manager Jose Mourinho. Iniesta, 28, has wowed fans with his mesmerizing skills while playing alongside the talented Xavi for both Barcelona and Spain. The diminutive midfielder, who has won two European Championship Finals and a World Cup, is one of the most pleasing to watch in the game. Like Messi, he has also won five La Liga titles as well as three Champions League successes. Ronaldo admits perceived arrogance has cost him . Both Iniesta and Ronaldo will start as underdogs in the final voting process, which also has a category for Coach of the Year. Spain's national manager, Vicente Del Bosque, is one of the final three candidates after leading his country to victory at Euro 2012.

"(CNN) -- Actress Mackenzie Phillips reveals she had a long-term incestuous relationship with her famous father, musician John Philips, in a tell-all memoir, according to People.com, which obtained an advance copy of her book. Actress Mackenzie Phillips reportedly reveals a family secret to Oprah Winfrey. Phillips, the 49-year-old former child star and daughter of the Mamas and the Papas founder John Phillips, says she had sex with her father the night before she was to marry Jeff Sessler, a member of the Rolling Stones entourage, in 1979, according to People.com. ""On the eve of my wedding, my father showed up, determined to stop it,"" writes Phillips, who was 19 at the time and a heavy drug user, according to People.com. ""I had tons of pills, and Dad had tons of everything too. Eventually I passed out on Dad's bed."" Phillips, best known as Julie Cooper on the sitcom ""One Day at a Time,"" says the sexual relationship became consensual as her life began to spiral out of control.

"(CNN) -- Relatives of 10-year-old Lyric Cook and 8-year-old Elizabeth Collins got news Monday that no family wants. Authorities identified the bodies found by hunters in a wooded area last week as those of the two young Iowa cousins, missing since July. Their bodies were found in the Seven Bridges Wildlife Area in Bremer County. Chief Kent Smock of the Evansdale, Iowa, Police Department, confirmed the news and said that the girls' families had been notified, according to a statement from the Black Hawk County Sheriff's Office. The cause of the death in both cases is pending. ""Our hearts and prayers go out to the families and friends of those precious little girls,"" said Black Hawk County Sheriff Tony Thompson. He vowed vigilance in pursuit of those responsible, and said no resource would be spared so that ""justice may prevail."" Lyric and Elizabeth were last seen by their grandmother on July 13 when they left for a bike ride. The girls' bicycles and a purse were found near Meyers Lake in Evansdale, hours after they were reported missing. A search of the 25-acre lake turned up nothing, and authorities eventually said they believed that the cousins had been abducted. About a week after the girls disappeared, investigators said they thought Lyric and Elizabeth were alive. FBI spokeswoman Sandy Breault declined then to say exactly what evidence they had to push them toward that conclusion, urging anyone with information to come forward. A $50,000 reward was offered for information leading to the successful recovery of the girls and the prosecution of the person, or people, responsible. The girls' disappearance sparked a massive volunteer search effort in Evansdale, a town of about 4,700 that is about 12 miles southeast of Cedar Falls. Last week, when the bodies were found but authorities had not yet identified them as belonging to the girls, residents gathered at Meyers Lake for a candlelight vigil, according to CNN affiliate KCRG. ""I guess I'm not surprised ... because of the length of time that they've been missing,"" Karen Carroll told the network. Carroll works at Poyner Elementary, where Elizabeth was in fourth grade. She said keeping morale up at the school has been tough. Students and staff created a ""remembrance chain"" that they will give to the girls' families, along with a memorial made from pink ribbons. The chain is built from rings of colored construction paper. Elizabeth's mother, Heather Collins, posted a message on Facebook last week expressing gratitude for the prayers and outpouring of support amid the ""gut-wrenching news."" ""We know that they are up in heaven with our savior,"" she wrote. ""Lord we know that you have them in your loving arms and we are so blessed.""

"(CNN) -- Research presented at a just-concluded breast cancer symposium will help doctors understand how to use existing drugs better when certain drugs don't work, and how chemotherapy may not be to blame for so-called ""chemo brain."" Breast cancer doctors and researchers from around the world gathered at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in San Antonio, Texas, last week to learn about the latest developments in treating the disease. Here are some of those latest developments: . 1. 'Chemo brain' starts before chemo . It's been known for a long time that when women undergo breast cancer treatment, they can have trouble remembering regular tasks and jobs. Chemotherapy, or so-called ""chemo brain,"" has often been blamed. There's still no good explanation for why this happens or how to treat it. Doctors are concerned about this because patients' concerns over ""chemo brain"" may result in a reluctance to accept life-saving therapy, said Bernadine Cimprich, an associate professor emerita at the University of Michigan School of Nursing in Ann Arbor, who presented a new study at SABCS. Using an MRI, her team tested patient's brain function while performing a working memory task in the scanner. This was done before any chemotherapy started and a month after treatment was completed. The study involved a total of 97 participants: 28 patients receiving chemotherapy, 37 patients who got radiation therapy and 32 healthy women. Breast cancer awareness: Not so pretty pink . The results showed that women who were scheduled to undergo chemotherapy had the lowest activation of the part of the brain that is critical for the effective performance of a working memory task: The left inferior frontal gyrus. Women who were not able or less able to activate the frontal brain region suffered greater fatigue over time, regardless of treatment, Cimprich said. Also, women expecting chemotherapy were more worried and more fatigued than the other groups, including the radiation group. Cimprich believes there's a need for increased awareness that cognitive problems can begin before a woman starts chemotherapy after her tumor is removed, including letting women know that as they wait for chemotherapy to start, they are more vulnerable to cognitive problems related to worry and fatigue. She said ""chemo brain"" may not be an appropriate label for cancer-related cognitive dysfunction because there are likely other sources that contribute to the problem or produce problems that wouldn't exist otherwise. 2. Twice as long is better with the drug tamoxifen . When breast cancer patients take the hormone-blocking drug tamoxifen for 10 years instead of five, they can significantly reduce their chances of the cancer coming back or of dying from it, according to new data from an ongoing clinical trial called ATLAS or Adjuvant Tamoxifen -- Longer Against Shorter. About a decade ago, the National Cancer Institute recommended premenopausal women with a type of cancer that is fueled by estrogen (called estrogen-positive breast cancer) should only take tamoxifen for five years after they've had tumors surgically removed. The argument was that there wasn't sufficient data to justify it taking longer, according to Dr. Peter Ravdin, director of the breast cancer program at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. While tamoxifen has been known to have a residual effect of another five years after a patient stops taking it, ""about one-third of relapse in estrogen-positive patients occur after five years,"" Ravdin said. Researchers from England, however, report that after taking tamoxifen for 10 years, the risk of a woman's cancer coming back was reduced by 30% and the risk of dying from the cancer was reduced by nearly half. These aren't the final results of the ATLAS trial, which is a huge clinical trial. Nearly 13,000 women were enrolled between 1996 and 2005, and researchers presented eight-year follow-up data from about 7,000 of them at SABC. There are side effects from taking this drug, including an elevated risk of endometrial cancer. But the risks are far smaller than the benefits, say researchers. Tamoxifen has been around long enough that a generic version is available and costs about $100 per month. Once the final results of ATLAS are in and it's compared to other similar studies, the standard of care for these patients will probably change from five to 10 years, according to the editorial accompanying the study in The Lancet. CDC: Breast cancer more deadly in black women . 3. Twice as much is better with the drug fulvestrant . Doubling the dose of a drug called fulvestrant improved survival in postmenopausal women who have estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer that has either spread in or outside the breast, according to one study. Fulvestrant works by blocking the action of estrogen on cancer cells, according to the National Institutes of Health. It was approved at a 250 mg dose, Ravdin said. But Italian researchers found a dose of 500 mg led to four months more of survival without the cancer getting worse and a 19% reduction in the risk of death, according to Dr. Angelo Di Leo, who heads the department of medical oncology at the Hospital of Prato, Istituto Toscano Tumori in Prato, Italy. 4. Twice as long is not better with the drug Herceptin . Women who are diagnosed with early stage Her2 positive breast cancer, another type of breast cancer, will be put on a drug called Herceptin, an artificial antibody which binds to the cancer cell and kills it. Giving Herceptin for a longer duration did not improve ""disease-free or overall survival"" over one year of treatment, research shows, said Dr. Martine J. Piccart, chief of the medicine department at the Jules Bordet Institute in Brussels, Belgium, president of the European Society for Medical Oncology and chair of the Breast International Group. Piccart said this very large trial conducted in many countries (not in the United States) confirms that the current regimen is still the best. Study questions benefit of yearly mammograms . 5. Avastin isn't indicated for breast cancer . Researchers were hoping that combining the cancer Avastin for one year with regular chemotherapy would help women with triple-negative breast cancer. This type of cancer, is very aggressive and has few effective treatment options. According to new data presented at SABC, adding Avastin (which stops the growth of blood vessels that help tumors grow) did not improve a patient's survival. Sadly, researchers have nothing extra to add to standard chemotherapy for early, triple-negative breast cancer, said Dr. David Cameron, professor of oncology at Edinburgh University in Scotland, who presented the data at the conference. Just over a year ago, the FDA withdrew its approval for Avastin for treating breast cancer patients because a review of various studies showed Avastin was not shown to be safe and effective for that use in this type of cancer. Avastin is still approved for treating certain types of colon, lung, kidney and brain cancer (glioblastoma multiforme).","Research shows improved outcomes with some drugs at higher doses or for a longer time .

"(CNN) -- Dallas Cowboys nose tackle Josh Brent was released from jail on $500,000 bond Sunday -- around the time his team pulled off an emotional, last-second win -- after his arrest in the fiery weekend car crash that killed his teammate. Brent was arrested on suspicion of intoxication manslaughter after a Mercedes he was driving flipped and caught fire early Saturday in Irving, Texas, the Dallas suburb where the Cowboys are based. He was out of the Irving City jail by 4:45 p.m. (5:45 p.m. ET), said a source at the jail who identified himself only by the last name McBride. Police said Brent's car was traveling at high speed when it hit a curb, and officers on the scene ""believed alcohol was a contributing factor in the crash."" In an arrest affidavit released Sunday, police reported that Brent was pulling his teammate, Jerry Brown Jr., from the wrecked vehicle when officers reached the scene of the crash. He refused a blood test, but police were able to take a sample from him because the case involved a fatality, the affidavit states. The car traveled about 900 feet after hitting the curb, said police spokesman John Argumaniz. The 25-year-old Brown, an outside linebacker on the Dallas practice squad, was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital. Cowboys players were told of Brown's death on their flight east Saturday for a game against the Cincinnati Bengals, said head coach Jason Garrett. They talked more extensively about the situation during meetings that night. ""My memory is of a big strapping guy with a bright smile on his face, bright eyes, bounce in his step every time I saw him,"" Garrett said. ""Twenty-five years old, he's no longer with us. And that's hard for everybody to handle."" Despite their heavy hearts, the Cowboys rallied Sunday from nine points down in the game's final minutes to beat the Bengals 20-19 on a last-second Dan Bailey field goal. Emotional players and coaches could be seen hugging afterward, with defensive lineman Jason Hatcher holding up Brown's No. 53 jersey. ""I think there was a feeling of numbness out on the field today, but somehow (the players) focused ... and we figured out a way to win,"" said Garrett, who added that he talked with Brown's mother after the game. ""I thought we honored him as well as he could be honored."" Brent, 24, is in his third season with the Cowboys. He appeared for arraignment Sunday morning and did not enter a plea during the brief hearing, according to a detention officer who requested anonymity because she was not authorized to talk to news outlets. The charge he faces is a second-degree felony that carries a potential two- to 20-year prison sentence with a maximum $10,000 fine. In a statement issued through his agent Saturday night, Brent said he was ""devastated"" over the accident and ""filled with grief for the loss of my close friend and team mate, Jerry Brown."" ""I am also grief-stricken for his family, friends and all who were blessed enough to have known him. I will live with this horrific and tragic loss every day for the rest of my life,"" the statement said. Brent pleaded guilty to a DUI charge in 2009, according to court records in Champaign, Illinois, where he played football with Brown at the University of Illinois. He received a 60-day sentence, a fine and 200 hours of community service. CNN's Lateef Mungin, Chandler Friedman and Greg Botelho reported from Atlanta. CNN's Jason Durand contributed to this report.","NEW: Josh Brent is released Sunday from Irving City jail, a source at the jail says .

"(CNN) -- For years after his NFL career ended, Ted Johnson could barely muster the energy to leave his house. In healthy brain tissue, virtually no protein tangles, which show up as brown spots, are visible. ""I'd [leave to] go see my kids for maybe 15 minutes,"" said Johnson. ""Then I would go back home and close the curtains, turn the lights off and I'd stay in bed. That was my routine for two years. ""Those were bad days."" These days, the former linebacker is less likely to recount the hundreds of tackles, scores of quarterback sacks or the three Super Bowl rings he earned as a linebacker for the New England Patriots. He is more likely to talk about suffering more than 100 concussions. ""I can definitely point to 2002 when I got back-to-back concussions. That's where the problems started,"" said Johnson, who retired after those two concussions. ""The depression, the sleep disorders and the mental fatigue."" Until recently, the best medical definition for concussion was a jarring blow to the head that temporarily stunned the senses, occasionally leading to unconsciousness. It has been considered an invisible injury, impossible to test -- no MRI, no CT scan can detect it.  Watch more on what goes on in athlete's brains » . But today, using tissue from retired NFL athletes culled posthumously, the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy (CSTE), at the Boston University School of Medicine, is shedding light on what concussions look like in the brain. The findings are stunning. Far from innocuous, invisible injuries, concussions confer tremendous brain damage. That damage has a name: chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). On Tuesday afternoon, researchers at the CSTE released a study about the sixth documented case of CTE in former NFL player Tom McHale, who died in 2008 at the age of 45, and the youngest case to date, an 18-year-old multi-sport athlete who suffered multiple concussions. While CTE in an ex-NFL player's brain may have been expected, the beginnings of brain damage in an 18-year-old brain was a ""shocking"" finding, according to Dr. Ann McKee, a neuropathologist at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Bedford, Massachusetts, and co-director of the CSTE. ""We think this is how chronic traumatic encephalopathy starts,"" said McKee. ""This is speculation, but I think we can assume that this would have continued to expand."" CTE has thus far been found in the brains of six out of six former NFL players. ""What's been surprising is that it's so extensive,"" said McKee. ""It's throughout the brain, not just on the superficial aspects of the brain, but it's deep inside."" CSTE studies reveal brown tangles flecked throughout the brain tissue of former NFL players who died young -- some as early as their 30s or 40s. McKee, who also studies Alzheimer's disease, says the tangles closely resemble what might be found in the brain of an 80-year-old with dementia. ""I knew what traumatic brain disease looked like in the very end stages, in the most severe cases,"" said McKee. ""To see the kind of changes we're seeing in 45-year-olds is basically unheard of."" The damage affects the parts of the brain that control emotion, rage, hypersexuality, even breathing, and recent studies find that CTE is a progressive disease that eventually kills brain cells. Chris Nowinski knows well the impact of concussions. He was a football star at Harvard before wrestling professionally with World Wrestling Entertainment. In one moment, his dreams of a long career wrestling were dashed by a kick to his chin. That kick, which caused Nowinski to black out and effectively ended his career, capped a career riddled with concussions. ""My world changed,"" said Nowinski. ""I had depression. I had memory problems. My head hurt for five years."" Nowinski began searching for studies, and what he found startled him. ""I realized when I was visiting a lot of doctors, they weren't giving me very good answers about what was wrong with my head,"" said Nowinski. ""I read [every study I could find] and I realized there was a ton of evidence showing concussions lead to depression, and multiple concussion can lead to Alzheimer's."" Nowinski decided further study was needed, so he founded the Sports Legacy Institute along with Dr. Robert Cantu, a neurosurgeon and the co-director of the CSTE. The project solicits for study the brains of ex-athletes who suffered multiple concussions. Once a family agrees to donate the brain, it is delivered to scientists at the CSTE to look for signs of damage. So far, the evidence of CTE is compelling. The Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy, along with other research institutions, has now identified traumatic encephalopathy in the brains of late NFL football players John Grimsley, Mike Webster, Andre Waters, Justin Strzelczyk and Terry Long, in addition to McHale. Grimsley died of an accidental gunshot wound to the chest. Webster, Long and Strzelczyk all died after long bouts of depression, while Waters committed suicide in 2006 at age 44. McHale was found dead last year of an apparent drug overdose. ""Guys were dying,"" said Nowinski. ""The fact of the matter was guys were dying because they played sports 10 or 20 years before."" So far, around 100 athletes have consented to have their brains studied after they die. Ted Johnson was one of the first to sign up. He said he believes that concussions he suffered while playing football explain the anger, depression and throbbing headaches that occasionally still plague him. Johnson said he played through concussions because he, like many other NFL athletes, did not understand the consequences. He has publicly criticized the NFL for not protecting players like him. ""They don't want you to know,"" said Johnson. ""It's not like when you get into the NFL there's a handout that says 'These are the effects of multiple concussions so beware.' "" In a statement, the NFL indicated that their staffs take a cautious, conservative approach to managing concussions. While they support research into the impact of concussions, they maintain that, ""Hundreds of thousands of people have played football and other sports without experiencing any problem of this type and there continues to be considerable debate within the medical community on the precise long-term effects of concussions and how they relate to other risk factors."" The NFL is planning its own independent medical study of retired NFL players on the long-term effects of concussion. ""Really my main reason even for talking about this is to help the guys who are already retired,"" said Johnson. ""[They] are getting divorced, going bankrupt, can't work, are depressed, and don't know what's wrong with them. [It is] to give them a name for it so they can go get help."" ""The idea that you can whack your head hundreds of times in your life and knock yourself out and get up and be fine is gone,"" said Nowinski. ""We know we can't do that anymore. This causes long-term damage.""","NEW: Researchers find start of brain damage in 18-year old athlete who died .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- A Kurdistan Regional Government spokesman expressed hope Wednesday that only a temporary ""technical issue"" led the Iraqi government to deny permission for Turkey's energy minister to fly to the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq. Energy Minister Taner Yildiz's plane was forced to turn around in mid-flight Tuesday. He was in a private plane flying to Irbil, the Kurdistan region's capital, to attend a three-day conference on oil and gas. ""We had applied for flight permits. We were issued one, and the plane was on the move,"" said a Turkish foreign ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity due to government protocol. ""But in the meantime we were notified by the Iraqis that they have banned all VIP flights to Northern Iraq."" But Kurdistan Regional Government spokesman Safeen Dizayee told CNN on Wednesday that officials there hope the denial was only temporary. ""There are new regulations by the central government for private planes to enter Iraqi airspace, and apparently energy minister's plane had not complied with the new regulations"" Dizayee said. ""Iraqi airspaces are completely controlled by the central government. The cabin crew of the Turkish minister's plane was directly in touch with Baghdad to get permission and Kurdistan Regional Government has no control on it"" he added. ""We hope it is only a technical issue and it will be resolved soon,"" he said. Opinion: Why U.S. should rethink policy over Syria's Kurds . Iraqi government officials have not commented on the aborted flight. The incident came at a time of heightened tension between Ankara and Baghdad. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Iraqi counterpart, Nuri al-Maliki, have engaged in a public war of words, accusing each other of pushing their respective countries towards civil war. For months, Turkey has also offered sanctuary to Iraq's fugitive vice president, Tarek al-Hashemi, who was sentenced to death in absentia by an Iraqi court for murder. And last August, the Iraqi central government loudly objected after Turkey's foreign minister made a short visit from Iraqi Kurdistan to the contested oil-rich city of Kirkuk, apparently without Baghdad's permission. Iraqi Kurds have witnessed a remarkable reversal over the past decade, as Turkey has gone from being a major adversary to being one of the Kurdistan Regional Government's largest trading partners. ""To ensure access to Kurdish oil and gas, Turkey has eased its trade, economic, diplomatic relations with the KRG. Even in some cases, it has acted as the protector of the Kurds in Northern Iraq,"" wrote Yerevan Saeed, an Iraqi Kurdish energy security analyst at Tufts University. ""This has made both Baghdad and Tehran angry, and they have been trying to limit Turkish influence,"" Saeed added, referring to Iran, another regional player that is seen by many observers as one of the chief patrons of the Baghdad government. The intrigues in Iraq have been complicated by the fact that relations are also deteriorating between al-Maliki's government and the Iraqi Kurds. The Iraqi central government and the Kurdistan Regional Government have been at odds for years over who has final authority over Iraq's vast oil wealth. In recent weeks, that tension has flared around Kirkuk. Last month, Iraqi Kurdistan deployed troops and tanks to cement the Kurds' claim over the strategic city. The Kurdish forces have been engaged in a tense standoff with units of the Iraqi Army, which were recently deployed to areas near Kirkuk.

"(CNN) -- Just days after an arson attack left a Bolivian radio personality in critical condition, police arrested four suspects. Now, the victim's family says, comes the real test: Will investigators uncover the mastermind behind the attack? The daylight attack on Radio Popular, a small FM station in the southern city of Yacuiba, happened Monday, as owner and host Fernando Vidal was on air conducting an interview. Four men forced their way into the radio station, said Vidal's son-in-law, Esteban Farfan. Two entered the studio. Listeners heard live on the radio the gunshot of one of the men, and the ensuing scuffle between Vidal and one of the intruders, while the other poured gasoline on him and his equipment. They lit Vidal on fire and fled. Read more: Bolivia weighs regulating social media . The 70-year-old radio personality, a former mayor and councilman, survived, but remains in critical condition with burns to his face and body, Farfan said. Another employee in the room, Karen Arze, suffered burns to a lesser extent and also is hospitalized, he said. Others escaped the radio station through the windows. The assault sparked international condemnation. It was a ""vicious and brazen"" attack, the spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said. Three men were arrested the next day as they tried to cross the border into Argentina, just miles from Yacuiba. They were charged preliminarily in connection with the attack, police commander Orlando Gongora said. A fourth suspect was arrested Wednesday and is awaiting a formal preliminary charge, he said. Police worked for 48 hours straight to identify the attackers, Gongora said. But Vidal's family insists that the incident has deeper roots. Read more: Bolivian officials, mutinous police continue talks . ""(The police) have done the easiest thing -- to arrest the four suspected attackers,"" Farfan said. ""Now we need to reveal the masterminds behind this."" Vidal is an outspoken and respected journalist who made enemies with his opinions, Farfan said. A leftist, Vidal was once close to President Evo Morales, but the journalist broke off his support over what he described as the president's turn to authoritarianism. He is a relentless critic of corruption, Farfan said. He calls out politicians who allegedly grow their personal bank accounts with state funds and routinely calls for investigations into corruption. At the time of the attack, Vidal was interviewing two guests on the topic of smuggling in the border area, leading to initial speculation that an organized crime group tied to the smuggling was behind the incident. But that explanation seems too convenient to Farfan. He believes that political opponents had a role in the attack against his father-in-law. ""The message is clear,"" Farfan said. ""(The attackers) want to shut us up."" But the cash-strapped station borrowed equipment and was back on the air less than 24 hours after the attack. The police commander is aware of the theories that someone ordered the attack on Vidal, but said it's too early in the investigation to know for sure. For police, the motive and any affiliation the four suspects may have with organized crime or other interests remains unknown. Before their arrests this week, the suspects had been in trouble with the law before, but only for minor robbery charges, the commander said. That doesn't make sense to Farfan.

"Seoul (CNN) -- Is she or isn't she? Pregnancy rumors and speculation are swirling around the world but the lady in question is saying nothing. This could easily be about a Hollywood star but this time, we're talking about the world's most reclusive nation, North Korea, and its first lady. Ri Sol Ju, the wife of young leader Kim Jong Un, has not been seen in public for around two months, according to North Korea watchers. A photo released by the state-run news agency KCNA shows her back in public and wearing a long coat that could be hiding a bump. Ri watched a football match and attended a musical concert with her husband Monday to mark the 60th anniversary of the Kim Il Sung Military University.

South Korean media has kicked into overdrive to speculate on whether she is pregnant or whether she was kept out of the public eye as a disciplinary measure for a perceived slight. Local media has claimed she may have fallen out of favor for not wearing a lapel pin of the former leaders, a requirement for adult North Koreans. ""Rumors first came out from officials who attended the same event,"" said Kim Yong-hoon, head of the North Korean desk at Daily NK, an online newspaper based in Seoul that focuses on North Korea. ""They started questioning and speculating if she was pregnant and it has spread throughout the country and that's how we heard about the rumors.""

By announcing Ri Sol Ju as his wife and having her accompany him on many public engagements, Kim Jong Un has shown a personality very different to his late father, Kim Jong Il. While producing a son and heir for a dynastic regime is considered very important, Delury points out ""that's also true for the families of the 'chaebol' or business conglomerates of South Korea, for Hyundai and Samsung,"" he says.

"(CNN) -- He's back. Having kept a relatively low profile since being forced to step down as Italy's premier last year, Silvio Berlusconi, the bad boy of Italian politics, has decided to run for the fourth time as the centre-right's prime ministerial candidate in a keenly awaited parliamentary election likely to take place in February. Italy needs a Berlusconi comeback like it needs a hole in the head. The scandal-plagued Berlusconi, who was recently sentenced to four years in prison for tax fraud but has a knack of successfully appealing against his convictions, epitomizes the dysfunctional nature of Italian politics, with its discredited leaders and unstable governments. Read more: Is the eurozone crisis almost over? Over the past year or so, Mario Monti, Italy's respected technocratic prime minister, has drawn attention away from these failings by restoring credibility to Italian policymaking. The problem was that Monti, who took over from Berlusconi in November 2011 in the face of a bond market crisis, was always dependent on the parliamentary support of Berlusconi's People of Liberty (PdL) party to govern. He now no longer has the PdL's backing and says he'll resign as soon as next year's budget is passed. So what next for Italy, and is a ""Berlusconi sell-off"" in the bond market in the offing? To be sure, Berlusconi's comeback is not entirely unexpected and is more about the implosion of, and dramatic loss of support for, the PdL (not to mention its dependence on Berlusconi for most of its funding) than anything else. Read more: The eurozone's reluctant leader . The real question, therefore, is whether investors have become too complacent about Italy in their expectation that policy continuity under the next government - which may yet include Monti - is more or less assured. I suspect they have to a degree and are now staring at the uncertain prospect of a post-Monti political landscape in Italy. Fortunately for Italy, the bond-buying programme of the European Central Bank (ECB) is providing a powerful counterweight to concerns about Italian politics. If Berlusconi's party had withdrawn its support for Monti's government before ECB president Mario Draghi promised in late July to ""do whatever it takes"" to save the eurozone, Italian yields would have already risen sharply. This is not to say that investors won't start to reprice Italian credit risk in the coming days and weeks. Rather, it suggests that the scope for a sharp and disorderly sell-off akin to the one Italy suffered in November 2011 is quite limited. Still, Monti's decision to stand down as premier once parliament approves the 2013 budget provides the first big test for Italy's bond market since the ECB-driven rally in Italian debt began in late July. Having shone mostly on Spain over the past few months, the spotlight of the markets is now shifting to Italy. The most important priority for Italian policymakers is to maintain confidence in the country's huge stock of government debt, the largest in the eurozone in absolute terms and the second-largest as a share of GDP after Greece. This is why Italy's upcoming government bond auctions will be scrutinized for any sign that investors are losing confidence in Italian debt - particularly since foreign buyers of Italian debt are already few and far between. Perhaps the most salient point about the latest developments in Italy is that investors should start paying more attention to idiosyncratic, or country-specific, risks. Just because the ECB is prepared to intervene forcefully in Italian and Spanish bond markets does not mean that the underlying problems of the eurozone's third and fourth-largest economies respectively are being addressed. Indeed, quite the opposite. Italy remains mired in recession and now faces weeks of political uncertainty at a time when it can least afford it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nicholas Spiro.","Silvio Berlusconi is making a fourth run for Prime Minister in Italy's upcoming parliamentary elections .

"New York (CNN) -- An inferno spread across a flooded neighborhood of Rockaway Peninsula in Queens early Tuesday, torching at least 80 homes as a potent mix of weather blasted the region. Some 200 firefighters battled the six-alarm blaze in Breezy Point, which was fed by high winds and made more perilous by downed electrical wires, according to witnesses and local authorities. ""The winds were just devastating, blowing from one building to another,"" New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at a news conference. By daybreak, emergency personnel and local volunteers could be seen sloshing through flooded streets to put out patches of remaining flames while others assessed what had been lost. Waking up to floods, fires and darkness after Sandy . Fire authorities reported three people were injured by Superstorm Sandy, though all injuries were considered minor.

""We couldn't help anybody,"" he said. ""I couldn't even help myself."" Floodwaters engulfed Mastrandrea's home and began to rise from his basement as the fire raged outside. ""We couldn't tell if the fires were 100 yards or a mile away,"" he said. ""It was just so bright. I couldn't tell where it was. ""I thought we were going to have to jump in the water,"" he added. Mastrandrea's home was largely destroyed as he fled with his family to higher ground. ""There's nothing here,"" he said. ""Our homes can always be rebuilt.

"London, England (CNN) -- Pop singer George Michael was jailed Tuesday to serve an eight-week sentence after pleading guilty to a charge that he drove while under the influence of drugs. The charge would normally carry a 12-week sentence, but District Judge John Perkins said he gave Michael credit for his guilty plea and his remorse. He said Michael must serve at least half the sentence. The case relates to an incident in the early hours of July 4, when Michael crashed his car into the front of a north London shop, damaging the facade. No one was hurt in the accident. Prosecutor Jonathan Efemini told the court Tuesday that when police got to the car, they found Michael wide-eyed and appearing ""spaced out."" He was also carrying two marijuana joints, Efemini said. Michael told police he had left home at 1:30 a.m. to see a friend but couldn't remember the route. He said he had taken a sleeping pill that had been prescribed eight days earlier and admitted smoking cannabis earlier in the night, Efemini said. About a dozen fans lined up to get a seat in court, but only five were allowed into the public gallery. Shelley Williams, 41, who was the first fan in, said, ""I just wanted him to know that his fans out there support him."" Another London fan, Anne Fallon, 41, said, ""It's really sad. I hope he can get the help he needs."" Michael, whose real name is Georgios Panayiotou, was sentenced for the formal charge of driving while unfit through drugs. His sentence includes a fine 1,250 pounds, or $1,925, and a five-year driving ban. He already reimbursed the shop owner in person for the damage, Efemini said. Despite showing leniency, the judge mentioned Michael's two previous drug arrests, saying, ""It does not appear you took proper steps to deal with what is clearly an addiction to cannabis."" Michael was found guilty in 2007 of unfit driving through tiredness and prescription medication and received a two-year driving ban. He also received a caution for cannabis in 2006 and a caution for cannabis and crack cocaine in 2008, Efemini said. He was arrested again the following year near Hampstead Heath park in north London and cautioned for possession of a controlled substance. Michael's defense attorney said his client had ""profound shame and horror"" at having committed another offense. ""He acknowledges and recognizes that his actions ... had the effect of causing other road users to be in danger,"" Mukul Chawla told the court, ""and that stark fact caused him to be greatly ashamed."" Chawla said Michael even admitted that shame to officers when he was arrested, telling the police, ""It's so ridiculously dangerous."" Michael has used prescribed medicine for many years, Chawla said, and earlier this year decided to stop taking them completely. Though it went well initially, Chawla said Michael eventually started having anxiety and insomnia, and reluctantly asked a doctor for sleeping pills to manage it. The defense highlighted Michael's extensive charity work, much of which he keeps private. Chawla called the singer a ""kind, considerate, loyal man, constantly concerned with the plight of others."" Chawla also revealed that Michael, a former member of the '80s group Wham!, has begun writing songs again for the first time in many years. ""His creativity, so long hidden by the [drugs], is reemerging,"" Chawla said. Melissa Gray .","Pop star begins serving eight-week sentence for driving under the influence .

"(CNN) -- The eurozone crisis has truly engulfed Italy -- but is it because the country is insolvent or simply unable to access funds easily in the financial markets? If Italy is solvent, a distinction can perhaps be drawn between it and the countries surviving on bailout funds from Europe and the International Monetary Fund -- Greece, Portugal and Ireland. The solution, in this case, would be for the European Central Bank to provide cheap liquidity -- loans, effectively -- to the Italian government for a limited period of time. The markets would then be pacified and the crisis would begin to be resolved. If only it were that easy. The distinction between being insolvent and unable to access funds easily in the financial markets might be natural to enterprises but it does not easily fit sovereign states. Italy is certainly finding it difficult to access funds -- the bond markets are gradually turning the tap off by pushing rates on ten year bonds above 7%. But how can we tell if it is insolvent? Solvency means that Italy could be reliably expected to service its national debt out of its expanding gross domestic product (GDP). If lenders were confident about growth and sufficient tax revenues, they would continue to meet Italy's public borrowing needs. If they were not, the country would have a liquidity problem, as is currently happening. Solvency and liquidity are closely connected for sovereign states. Financial markets rightly worry about Italy's solvency. They have often been wrong during the last several years, but not this time. Since the mid-1990s, Italian growth has been less than 2% a year; investment and consumption have been practically flat; increases in people's real income have been among the weakest in Europe, worse even than Germany. Italian households, traditionally conservative, have increased their borrowing to 45% of GDP. Only one word can characterize Italian performance during the years of monetary union: stagnation. The country has systematically lost competitiveness relative to Germany. The result has been one of the highest national debts in Europe, standing at around 120% of GDP. Critically, as Italian households have come under pressure, national saving has been steadily declining, making it difficult for the country to service its national debt. Lenders are justifiably worried since, in all these respects, Italy looks similar to the struggling smaller economies of the eurozone periphery. It might be a sizeable economy with a large industrial base, but that means little in this case. The European Monetary Union -- which is the system within which the euro operates -- has trapped several countries of diverging competitiveness within a rigid framework of fixed exchange rates, a single monetary policy, tough fiscal discipline, and continuous pressure on labor. The markets realize that Italy's debt predicament is similar to peripheral countries, and are sensing that the crisis is gradually moving to the core. The response of the European Union has been a testament to its weakness. To placate markets it has demanded the imposition of austerity on Italy. But the economics of austerity makes no sense at all. Italian problems have originated in a stagnant economy, not in a profligate state. Austerity would almost certainly make things worse by pushing the country into recession, thus worsening the burden of debt. Greece is an extreme case, but it shows graphically the dangers. Italy is entering a risky path -- and the markets know it. On top of that, the imposition of austerity has directly transgressed on Italian sovereignty and on the domestic democratic process, as it has done elsewhere in the periphery. The EU appears to be increasingly run by a small cabal of core countries which impose decisions on others, ignore national institutions and practices, and even force elected governments out of office in preference to so-called non-political administrators. As the liquidity crisis gets sharper and Italy threatens to be shut out of the markets, the EU has only one weapon in its armory: the European Central Bank . It must stem the unfolding collapse of the monetary union by allowing the ECB to buy large volumes of Italian debt. But this could only fix the shortage of liquidity -- Italy's solvency problem will continue and probably become worse through austerity. If, moreover, the ECB started freely to purchase the public debt of the other 16 countries, it would soil its own balance sheet, a dangerous course to adopt as there is no state to back it up. The credibility of the euro would suffer across the world, defeating the purpose of the monetary union for Germany and other countries at the core. With Italy in turmoil, the EMU is coming up against its own contradictions and probably heading for a breakup. The mix of economic malfunctioning and open disregard for national sovereignty and democracy is highly combustible. Peripheral countries, in particular, are steadily forced toward the exit, with Greece under the most intense pressure. This is probably the only way to break out of the trap of monetary union, while restoring sovereignty and reasserting democracy. Should that occur, the implications for the European and the global economy will be very severe. But those who decide EU policy would have only themselves to blame. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Costas Lapavitsas .","Costas Lapavitsas is the lead author of a new RMF report 'Breaking Up? A Route Out of the Eurozone Crisis'

"Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (CNN) -- We all know that vaccines save lives by protecting people against disease. What is less well-known is that vaccines also are an engine for economic growth -- far beyond their health benefits. I am reminded of this in Tanzania this week, where my organization, the GAVI Alliance, is hosting a conference for its partners. GAVI's mission is to save children's lives and protect people's health by increasing access to immunization in developing countries. We don't do this alone. We have many partners, including prominent companies that work closely with GAVI. They recognize that in addition to the humanitarian need, countries such as Tanzania are emerging markets that can fulfill their economic ambitions only if they also can ensure good health for their citizens. The private sector is a critical part of the equation. Our corporate partners know they can do well by doing good. Consider Tanzania. It has an ambitious five-year development plan that aims to transform the country into a middle-income economy by 2025. The plan includes critical funding to ensure a healthy population by strengthening the health system, which will significantly improve child and maternal mortality rates. Tanzania already has begun this process by working closely with GAVI and its partners to significantly increase its routine vaccine coverage rates to above 90% today from 79% in 2001, the year before GAVI began its work there, according to data from the World Health Organization and UNICEF. At the same time, Tanzania's GDP growth has been astounding, rising to $23.7 billion last year from $10.2 billion in 2001, according to the World Bank. See also: Trekking savannah to deliver vaccines . Is there a connection? Further study is needed in the case of Tanzania. But we know for a fact that vaccines -- in addition to saving lives and improving health -- are the cornerstone of a vibrant economy, fuel growth and serve as a magnet for foreign investment. Indeed, research has shown vaccines to be among the most cost-effective investments in global development. This has been borne out of several independent studies that look beyond the health impacts toward areas such as cognitive development, educational attainment, labor productivity and financial attainment. In other words, healthier children -- spurred by immunization -- attend school more often, learn more while they are there and remain in school longer. As adults, they therefore are more productive, earn more money, save and invest more, and live longer. Healthier children also spread less disease through the adult population, further increasing productivity. See also: Fighting cancer with cell phones: Innovation to save lives in Africa . These academic papers, including one recently published that focuses on how to measure the economic benefits of the HPV vaccine, are getting noticed in African countries -- not only by health ministers, but also by finance ministers and other officials. For instance, I attended a landmark meeting in Tunis in July organized by the African Development Bank, where its President Donald Kaberuka brought together a variety of ministers and experts to discuss how to allocate budgets and make healthcare a national priority. I was in Tunis because of the wide recognition that immunization can be the high-octane fuel that leads to increased trade, capital infrastructure projects and technological improvement. This brings me back to the private sector and the benefits many companies now see in playing a role in supporting global health, including immunization services. One benefit, of course, is humanitarian. The GAVI Alliance -- with help from partners such as UNICEF, WHO, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Bank and donors -- has helped countries immunize 370 million people, saving more than 5.5 million lives since 2000. GAVI now is in the midst of helping immunize another quarter billion people, which could save an additional 4 million lives by 2015. The private sector is involved, providing core business skills to tackle key obstacles to immunization in the developing world. For example, GAVI is working with a leading telecommunications company to explore the use of its mobile technology with hopes of improving vaccine stock management in implementing countries and alerting parents when children are due for vaccines. GAVI is constantly looking for partners to lend their business savvy to help us accomplish our mission. An increasing number of them are responding, compassionate in their outlook while aware of the underlying economic value of vaccines. They understand that this is the highest return on investment they could ever make.

"(CNN) -- My favorite thing about New York City is that there are so many different ways to live here. As I love to tell first-time visitors and far-flung friends who ask me why I'd choose to make my home in such a crowded, expensive, dangerous, stuck-up, difficult place: first of all, it chose me; and second, it's what you make it. Depending on your means and motivations, you could spend your days on the floor of the Stock Exchange, basking in the bright lights of Broadway, stoop-sitting in the East Village, hawking fish in Hunts Point, maxing out your platinum card on Fifth Avenue or selling arepas under the 7 train after the nightclubs let out in Jackson Heights, Queens. There are as many New Yorks as there are New Yorkers. Or at least there were. Today there are two: those with power and those hunkering down in the dark. When Superstorm Sandy savaged much of the Eastern Seaboard on Monday night, it swallowed up lives and livelihoods and homes, and left the United States' most populous city with widespread electrical outages, and effectively landlocked. The disconnect is sharp, eerie and painfully familiar for longtime New Yorkers who have weathered all manner of wounds to our city. Victims fall to Mother Nature's wrath . I'm writing this from my well-lit and warm apartment in Brooklyn, as I wait for my husband to ferry my friend Sarah and her dog Sheldon here from their home in Manhattan. While we were lucky enough to suffer only power flickers and some overturned plants, Sarah rode out the storm in her Stuyvesant Town apartment, just blocks from where a transformer exploded in a power plant in the height of the storm. Sarah has been without electricity, running water, heat or much in the way of communication, and she's uncertain what she'll find -- other than total loss and an astonishing stench -- when she's finally able to re-enter the walk-in refrigerator of her East Village restaurant. And yet, in the face of loss of possessions, inventory, revenue and shelter, she's expressed just one emotion, gratitude, and one impulse -- to help others. And there's a lot of help needed here. Those in the dark zone -- effectively Manhattan below 40th Street and areas of Brooklyn and Queens, especially along the waterfront -- who have been able to send up occasional digital flares have painted a dire picture of what's going on around them.

"Washington (CNN) -- The so-called ""lame duck"" session of the Democratic Congress convened Monday, with members preparing to make decisions on a host of contentious issues that could have major political ramifications for both President Barack Obama and the incoming Republican House majority. Newly elected House members, meanwhile, were given a daylong orientation on the rules and procedures governing life on Capitol Hill. They are set to take office in January. In the Senate, two new members -- Delaware's Chris Coons and West Virginia's Joe Manchin -- were sworn in by Vice President Joe Biden.  Coons and Manchin are both Democrats; their addition to the Senate did not change the chamber's 59-41 Democratic edge for the lame duck session.  Senate Democrats will have a smaller 53 to 47 majority next year. Manchin was elected to fill the final two years of the late Sen. Robert Byrd's term.  Coons will serve the final four years of Biden's term. One of the first challenges for the House is the selection of its new leadership.  Republicans are expected to tap Ohio Rep. John Boehner and Virginia Rep. Eric Cantor as speaker and majority leader, respectively.  Democrats appear ready to tap current House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California as the new minority leader, while also keeping Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer and South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn in the leadership. But North Carolina Rep. Heath Shuler, a more conservative Democrat, appears ready to challenge Pelosi if she doesn't step down. GOP senators face a tough vote Tuesday on whether to ban earmarks, a policy House Republicans already have in place and are expected to keep in the new Congress.  The idea of prohibiting members from designating funding for specific projects in their states or districts is popular with reform-minded deficit hawks but opposed by congressional veterans trying to steer funds to constituencies back home. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, a longtime defender of earmarks, announced Monday that he intends to vote for the ban when the GOP Senate caucus meets Tuesday. ""I'm not wild about turning over more spending authority to the executive branch, but I have come to share the view of most Americans that our nation is at a crossroads,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor.  The ""only way we will be able to turn the corner and save our future is if elected leaders like me make the kinds of difficult decisions voters are clearly asking us to make."" Obama responded with a statement welcoming McConnell's ""decision to join me and members of both parties who support cracking down on wasteful earmark spending, which we can't afford during these tough economic times."" But, the president added, ""we can't stop with earmarks as they represent only part of the problem."" Obama may weigh in more on Thursday, when he is scheduled to meet with the bipartisan congressional leadership at the White House. At the top of the agenda: whether to extend the Bush tax cuts for families making more than $250,000.  Republicans contend that failure to extend the cuts for everyone would be a mistake in a weak economy.   Obama considers such a move a roughly $700 billion budget-busting mistake, but recently suggested he's willing to compromise. If Congress fails to act, all the cuts will expire at the end of the year. In addition to the tax cuts, the lame duck Congress also has to consider expiring cuts in the estate tax.  If Congress fails to act, the estate tax rate -- currently zero -- will return to 55 percent on assets over $1 million.  One bipartisan Senate proposal would cap the tax at 35 percent on assets over $3.5 million, but serious negotiations have not begun, according to aides from both parties. Congress must also decide what to do about a bill that is keeping the government running but is set to expire December 3.  House Republicans want a nearly yearlong extension, but with funding cut to 2008 levels.  Democrats are resisting, though some Democratic senators appear to be open to some reductions. Also on the agenda: a possible repeal of the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy barring gays and lesbians from serving openly in the armed forces.  The repeal is attached to an annual defense authorization bill.  There is still significant opposition in the Republican caucus to lifting the ban, raising doubt about whether the defense bill will come up for a final vote this year. The Senate must also take up ratification of the nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia, a long-stalled food safety measure, an extension of unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless and funding for the settlement of a discrimination suit by black farmers. At the same time, House Democrats are pushing a measure to give Social Security recipients a $250 payment to make up for not getting a cost-of- living adjustment this year because inflation is low.  They're also trying to pass a child nutrition bill backed by first lady Michelle Obama and the Dream Act, which would create a path to citizenship for young illegal immigrants if they attend college or serve in the military. Congress is also slated to consider adjustments to the Alternative Minimum Tax and another extension of the so-called ""doc-fix,"" preventing reimbursement cuts to doctors treating Medicare patients. Hanging over all the deliberations of the lame duck session: the enormous pressure to cut spending being brought to bear by the incoming conservative group of congressmen. ""I'm certainly going to come up here and do the things that the people elected me to do, and that is get this out of control spending under control,"" Missouri GOP Rep.-elect Billy Long told CNN.  ""We're going to be in bad, bad trouble if we don't get some of this under control, and I'm not afraid to make the tough votes."" Steve Southerland, a newly elected Florida Republican, also repeated the campaign mantra of pushing for a smaller government. ""As the federal government has expanded, small businesses and communities around this country have constricted,"" he said.  ""And that's not a trend that I think should continue.""

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea said Wednesday that it had given the title of marshal of the army to its young leader, Kim Jong Un, the latest in a string of moves to reconfigure the top ranks of the military. Kim, who is already referred to as ""supreme commander"" of the Korean People's Army, has been awarded the title of marshal by the reclusive regime's most powerful political and military bodies, the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported. The announcement follows the removal of the army chief, Ri Yong Ho, from all his government posts on Sunday, a decision KCNA said was motivated by an unspecified illness. Ri was considered one of Kim's closest aides. A day later, North Korea promoted a little known general, Hyon Yong Chol, to the rank of vice marshal. Analysts have speculated that the moves may show signs of a struggle within the regime between the military and civilian elites as Kim seeks to consolidate power after succeeding his father, Kim Jong Il, who died in December. The young leader's new title is probably partially related to the recent military reshuffle and appears intended ""to emphasize he's in a position of power,"" said Andrei Lankov, a professor at Kookmin University in South Korea. Kim Jong Il held the title of marshal when he ruled North Korea. In February, he was posthumously named ""generalissimo"" or grand marshal. As a result, Kim Jong Un had been widely expected to take the title of marshal. ""I recently spoke to a group of North Korean specialists and everyone was surprised the promotion had not happened yet,"" Lankov said. CNN's Paula Hancocks reported from Seoul; Jethro Mullen reported from Hong Kong.

"(CNN) -- Halloween will come a little late for some this year, thanks to Superstorm Sandy, but in areas of New York that didn't take a major beating, revelers and trick-or-treaters were eager to celebrate after days of being cooped up inside. The situation is still dire in many parts of the East Coast, including New Jersey, where neighborhoods are littered with debris from shattered homes, downed trees and power lines. Citing safety concerns, Gov. Chris Christie signed an executive order Wednesday postponing Halloween. ""I've taken this action to minimize additional risks to lives and the public safety as we begin the process of rebuilding and recovering from Hurricane Sandy,"" Christie said. ""In too many communities in our state, the damage and losses from this storm are still being sorted out, and dangerous conditions abound even as our emergency management and response officials continue their work."" Elsewhere, residents in parts of New York, Pennsylvania and Connecticut were asked to hold off on trick-or-treating. Parades were postponed or canceled, including New York's annual Village Halloween Party, which the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management and the New York Police Department canceled for the first time in 39 years. But that didn't stop celebrations altogether for residents of New York's outer boroughs who had planned on attending the Village Halloween Party. Hallow-meme costumes take off . ""We were already planning on having a party. But now that nobody can get into Manhattan we are really having a party,"" said Brooklyn resident Adam Scher, who invited friends to enjoy electricity and running water in the office of his online marketing agency in Clinton Hill Wednesday night. ""People need something to do,"" he said. ""Everyone has been cooped up inside for the past four days, and nobody has anywhere to go or anything to do, so why not provide them with some fun celebratory festivities!"" In Brooklyn's Williamsburg neighborhood, iReporter Luis C. Muniz took pictures of trick-or-treaters walking around storm detritus. ""Even though most of New York City is still paralyzed and without electricity, the spirit of Halloween is alive and well,"" he said. On New York's Upper West Side, costumed children and parents also had to avoid downed trees and store awnings surrounded by yellow caution tape as they searched for Halloween treats, which were in short supply. In some high-rise buildings that had power, the tradition of apartment trick-or-treating continued if residents could find candy. ""On the one hand, the kids and parents were so happy to be outside and have some semblance of Halloween celebration,"" said iReporter Jodi Kaplan, who lives on the Upper West Side. ""What was striking was that the stores did not have any decorations, or had tape and boards over the front windows. Half of them are still closed down. And the half that were open were almost all out of candy."" An undercurrent of guilt pervaded the festive atmosphere, she said, because revelers knew that residents of lower Manhattan, much of which was still without power and littered with storm damage, could not participate. With several cities along the East Coast experiencing power outages, information was hard to come by, leaving many to improvise or source information through social media. Colleen Napoli of Wantagh, New York, posted updates on Facebook to alert friends who didn't have power in their homes but could check their smartphones. The town of Hempstead, where she lives, asked residents to postpone trick-or-treating until Saturday, and a parade in nearby Huntington was canceled. Halloween facts and figures . Instead, the married mother of five brought her kids to East Meadow, where parents met in a school parking lot for a ""trunk or treat,"" she said. They lined up their cars next to each other with trunks open to display big bowls of candy. The kids went from car to car scooping up treats before hitting the playground. While the kids got to expel pent up energy from being housebound, parents were able to commiserate, she said. They shared stories of losing roofs and exchanged information about school openings, upcoming games and where to find gas or bread. ""It was endearing and heartwarming to see a town coming together in this moment. It brought lightness to what was a dark situation,"" she said. Elsewhere, the change in routine brought neighbors together as they've been forced to improvise. For Lia Mariscal and her family in Hoboken, New Jersey, that meant Halloween actually arrived a little early this year. Her 13-floor, 70-unit apartment building was still without power Tuesday and surrounded by a couple of feet of water. ""Our building is full of bored trapped kids,"" she said. To keep them busy, everyone gathered in the lobby and played board games on Tuesday. Later in the day, the children dressed up in their costumes and went trick-or-treating in the building, she said. ""Some of the families had not gotten a chance to get candy so they improvised,"" she said in a Facebook message. Because she's been home for four days, Jee Won Park, who normally works full time, finally met her neighbors in Washington Heights after living in her building for a year and a half. Thanks to one mother in the building -- ""There's always one mom who organizes for all the other mommies,"" said Park -- families have been taking turns hosting events and gatherings so the load is spread out among several families. Since Monday, there have been group playdates, a pancake party, movie sessions and even (this being New York) a yoga class. ""Because of the nature of my job, I have not been around very much, so it's great to meet the other mommies,"" said Park. ""It's taken me a year and a half and a hurricane,"" she said. ""They said, 'We never even knew you actually had a kid.' "" Did you celebrate Halloween in spite of Sandy or were you forced to postpone festivities?

"(CNN) -- Attention, Upper East Siders: Headbands are back! If you're not a fan of ""Gossip Girl,"" that reference was probably lost on you, but that doesn't mean you're unfamiliar with the CW series' impact on fashion, and one hair accessory in particular. Thanks to countless pleas from fans, costume designer Eric Daman is bringing back Blair Waldorf's (Leighton Meester) headbands. ""We tried to (compensate) with the hats last year, but it didn't seem to have the same impact,"" Daman said. ""I feel like the headband was such a thing for her when she was in high school. We wanted to segue out of it for a little bit."" Going into its sixth and final, season, ""Gossip Girl"" would rather recycle an on-screen relationship than an outfit. While some characters have found themselves back in the arms of past lovers, ""every handbag, every shoe, every accessory, every piece of clothing is only used for the scene that it's in,"" Daman said. With the exception of some of the men's suits and dress shirts, that is. Season six, which premieres October 8, will be no exception. In addition to Blair's headbands, Daman said, fans can expect a ""rich fall color palette"" complete with ""deep sapphire blues, military olives, delicious aubergines punctuated by pops of fuchsia."" And look for ""neons and acidic yellows in the way of accessories, shoes and bags."" Rather than the statement jewelry the characters have rocked of late, Daman said, it's all about delicate layering pieces this season. He called jewelry designer Meira T ""one of this season's best discoveries."" Fall TV fashion: Outfitting 'Revenge' Daman comes from ""Sex and the City,"" where he was an assistant costume designer on seasons 2, 3 and 4. He said his reputation, from working alongside Pat Field on the HBO series, was one reason designers were excited about getting involved with ""Gossip Girl"" early on. ""It's an honor and a privilege for me to be able to have access to all these amazing designers. ... If I tried to do the show on our budget, there'd be no way it would look like it does."" Viewers should expect to see pieces by Valentino, Jonathan Saunders, McQueen, Prada, Marni, Gucci, Jenny Packham and Bottega Veneta on screen this fall. But outfitting a show like ""Gossip Girl"" isn't as simple as just plucking looks from the runway. Daman styles each ensemble, putting different pieces together to create something unique, like Serena van der Woodsen's (Blake Lively) Jimmy Choo bag and Marc Jacobs laptop case, which peeked out of the tote. It didn't take long before blogs were buzzing about the combo. Fall TV fashion: Outfitting 'Pretty Little Liars' ""All the characters have really grown in story and in style,"" Daman said, ""making statements and fashion headlines with their wardrobe choices on the way."" Chuck Bass, played by Ed Westwick, has had a significant style transformation, Daman added: He's gone from ""bad-boy billionaire to seriously suited business maven."" Gordon Gekko -- Michael Douglas' character in 1987's ""Wall Street"" -- and Patrick Bateman -- Christian Bale's character in 2000's ""American Psycho"" -- both inspired Chuck's current style, Daman said. ""(Chuck) can wear whatever he wants,"" Daman said. ""He can wear a pink suit and an ascot and pull it off. ... When you have men wearing pastels, there's kind of a power behind the sexuality, I think. They're so confident."" Blair and Serena have also come a long way from the Constance Billard School uniforms they wore for the better part of the show's first and second seasons. Fall TV fashion: Outfitting 'Scandal' ""The challenge really was ... giving them each their own kind of identity,"" Daman said of accessorizing their uniforms. ""Blair obviously started with the headband, and then it became giant ruffled bow blouses and fuller skirts. ... Whereas Serena was wearing her skirt from when she was a sophomore, which was a different plaid. ... It was a little shorter and just kind of worked with who her character was. And to make her more boho chic, she was wearing T-shirts and not proper blouses ... then we'd accessorize her with sparkly cardigans or great little leather vests."" Giving the actors an identity through their wardrobe really helps them ""generate who they need to be for their characters,"" he added. And while Daman notes many high points in his five years working on the series, his proudest moment came during season 2, when he watched his own creation walk the runway in ""The Serena Also Rises."" ""It was a Jenny Humphrey (Taylor Momsen) design that Serena (Lively) wore ... a green bubble dress she wore in an Eleanor Waldorf (Margaret Colin) fashion show,"" he said. ""It fit Blake (Lively) like a glove, and it was just one of those moments where I was like, wow, that's really a great dress."" Daman teased that there's a possibility season 6 will call for more original designs. In which case, viewers might get to see more from him. Either way, fans will see Daman channel a different decade on the '80s-set ""Sex and the City"" prequel, ""The Carrie Diaries,"" which is expected to debut on The CW in January. Daman drew from his experience as an assistant costume designer on the original series to reinvent Carrie Bradshaw as a teenage girl. ""As (Bradshaw, played by AnnaSophia Robb), grows up, we're going to see the development of her fashion style grow and understand where it all comes from,"" he said. In the meantime, Daman is excited for fans to see what he's got up his sleeves for the last season of ""Gossip Girl."" Given the state of the economy, he said, ""people just enjoyed getting lost in the drama and the jewels and the sparkly-ness.""","Eric Daman is the costume designer on ""Gossip Girl,"" which is heading into its sixth season .

"(CNN) -- Like St. Augustine's prayer ""God make me chaste - but not yet,"" Filipino fighter Manny Pacquiao's personal conversation with God may not lead to his retirement anytime soon. Pacquiao said in a radio interview on Monday he had a dream in which God had told him to hang up his gloves, fueling speculation he may back out of a long-anticipated fight with American Floyd Mayweather. ""I will not stay long in boxing because He said: 'You have done enough. You have made yourself famous but this is harmful',"" he told Manila's DZMM radio. However, his team say retirement is still a long way off. ""A few years ago the pressure for him to retire was coming from his mother,"" Pacquiao's business manager Eric Pineda told CNN. ""But recently he dreamt that God told him to retire but there's nothing definite about his retirement either this year or next year. ""This year it's out of the question,"" Pineda said. ""And I'm not even sure about next year either."" He said a Mayweather fight would be up to the Mayweather camp, but that Pacquiao was more than ready to meet him in the ring. ""Manny is a fighter and there is still the desire,"" Pineda said. ""He really wants this thing with Mayweather to happen. ""He doesn't want to retire leaving unanswered questions."" Pacquiao, 33, has a 54-3 win-loss record with two draws and plans to pit his World Boxing Organization welterweight crown against undefeated American Timothy Bradley in Las Vegas on June 9. Boxing fans have long sought a fight between Mayweather and Pacquiao. The pair were in negotiations for a fight to be held later this year but talks fell through. The 34-year-old American boxer has won all 42 of his professional fights, 26 by knockout. ""People are clamoring for this fight -- and it will probably be bigger than the Ali/Frazier fight. Manny still wants to prove to himself that he can beat Mayweather,"" Pineda added. Pacquiao also has an ongoing defamation suit against Mayweather, claiming the American fighter has insinuated that his success is the result of performance-enhancing drugs. Pacquiao is the first boxer in the sport's history to have won world titles in eight weight divisions and recently launched a successful political career after being elected to the Philippine House of Representatives in June 2010. Formerly a heavy gambler and late-night party-goer, Philippines media reported in February that Pacquiao had renewed his commitment to his faith, shutting down a restaurant and bar he owned, selling shares in a casino and nightclub and selling his cockfighting gamecocks.","Pacquiao says he had a dream in which God told him to retire .

"(CNN) -- A prominent Texas attorney and former university trustee faces charges of laundering more than $600 million for a Mexican drug cartel. Marco Antonio Delgado, 46, was in court Thursday to face his charges, according to federal authorities. The attorney, who once was a trustee at the Carnegie Mellon University, was arrested on November 2 at a restaurant in El Paso. ""Delgado is linked to a drug cartel based in Guadalajara, Mexico, and accused of conspiring to launder more than $600 million,"" investigators with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Homeland Security Investigations said in a statement. Delgado faces a maximum 20 year prison sentence if convicted, federal authorities said. Delgado had been active in the local community as he was a member of the board at the El Paso Symphony Orchestra and once donated more than $20,000 to the organization. Ruth Jacobson, executive director of the symphony, told CNN affiliate KFOX that she was ""surprised and saddened"" by the arrest. Delgado also donated to Carnegie Mellon University setting up the ""Marco Delgado Fellowship for the Advancement of Hispanics in Public Policy and Management ,"" according to the website of the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania based university. The scholarship that started in 2003 awards about $5,000 to ""students who are expected to make a significant contribution to the Latino community,"" the website said.

"(CNN) -- Mesut Ozil salvaged a 2-2 home draw for Real Madrid against Borussia Dortmund in their Champions League Tuesday with a last-gasp equalizer. German champions Dortmund looked set for a famous win in the Bernabeu until Ozil struck, but they still lead the so-called ""Group of Champions"" by a point with two matches remaining. Ajax Amsterdam kept their hopes of qualifying for the last 16 knockout stage alive with a 2-2 draw at English Premier League champions Manchester City, whose slim hopes took a further knock. City were stunned in their Etihad Stadium as Siem de Jong took advantage of slack defending to score twice in quick succession. The home side gave themselves renewed hope when Yaya Toure volleyed home to cut the deficit and Sergio Aguero leveled after the break. City had an goal disallowed for offside and Mario Balotelli's penalty appeal on the final whistle was also ignored. Manager Roberto Mancini confronted the match officials after the incident which leaves his team without a win in four games. Dortmund, so impressive in the Etihad in a drawn match in the previous round of matches, were again on top form on the road in Madrid. They took the lead when Marco Reus volleyed an unstoppable shot past Iker Casillas but Pepe leveled for Real with a thumping header. Just before half time, Dortmund went ahead again as Robert Lewandowski crossed for Mario Goetze to force Alvaro Abeloa to put past his own goalkeeper. Only a minute was remaining when German international Ozil curled in a free kick to spare Jose Mourinho's men a rare home defeat. Schalke came from two goals behind to earn a 2-2 home draw in Gelsenkirchen with EPL side Arsenal. England's Theo Walcott and French international Olivier Giroud put the visitors in command at the Veltins Arena with neat strikes in quick succession in the first half. But Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored a crucial goal for the Royal Blues just before half time to rekindle their hopes, shortly after being denied by a superb save from Vito Mannone. The home side pressed strongly for the equalizer in the second half and it came as no surprise when Peru striker Jefferson Farfan hammered home their second. But Arsenal were always dangerous on the break and Walcott was left frustrated at the end as his effort was blocked by Lars Unnerstall. ""It's regrettable that we conceded a goal before the break, then missed a goal with the last chance of the game. They both had a great influence on the result,"" Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger told Sky Sports. The result leaves Schalke one point clear of Group B ahead of Arsenal. Olympiakos of Greece are third, one point further back after beating French side Montpellier 3-1 in the other match. Champions League new boys Malaga sealed their passage to the knockout stage with a 1-1 draw at seven-time champions AC Milan in Group C. Eliseu put the Spanish visitors ahead just before half time, but Milan stayed in second place in the section after Pato equalized in the second half. Delighted Malaga manager Manuel Pellegrini lauded their efforts. ""We didn't win, but to come to the San Siro and get a draw is an important victory for us,"" he told AFP. Anderlecht moved to within a point of Milan in the battle for the second qualification spot with a 1-0 home win over Zenit St. Petersburg. Portuguese giants Porto also clinched their qualification from Group A with a goalless draw at Dynamo Kiev in the Ukraine.

"(CNN) -- As President Obama and Mexican President Felipe Calderon talk tough about cracking down on the deadly drug war, the United States is changing tactics in the battle against illegal narcotics at home. Legalizing marijuana is off the table, the White House says. The man Obama picked to be the new ""drug czar,"" Gil Kerlikowske, has made it clear that the United States is going to do a better job of treating addicts to try to reduce the demand for narcotics. Kerlikowske, 59, is a military veteran with 36 years of law enforcement experience. The drug czar oversees an agency that sets the country's drug-control strategy. The White House and Congress want to see more drug courts, and increased funding for the program 250 percent in the spending bill signed in March. It's a campaign pledge that the Obama administration thinks will give nonviolent offenders ""a chance to serve their sentence, where appropriate, in the type of drug rehabilitation programs that have proven to work better than a prison term in changing bad behavior,"" according to the White House Web site. Judge Paul Gluchowski, who works with the Prince William County Juvenile Drug Court in Virginia, dismissed the notion that a drug treatment program is the easy way out.  Watch what it's like inside the drug court » . If anyone thinks that, he said he'd tell them they should ""come and talk to some of the participants. A lot of them probably wish they never agreed to undergo drug court. And a lot of them have given up because it's too hard."" Those who slip up in drug court can be forced to wear ankle-monitoring bracelets or put into juvenile detention. ""If they don't give up, then when it comes time for graduation and you see the shine on their face, when you know that they have accomplished something, and they know that. That's what it's all about,"" Gluchowski said. Vice President Joe Biden stressed the importance of drug courts and prisoner re-entry programs when he announced Kerlikowske's position in March, saying they ""can serve as the light at the end of the tunnel, of a very long, long dark tunnel, for those who are stuck in the cycle of drug addiction and incarceration."" Kerlikowske said he was committed to tackling the nation's drug problem, but noted that it would take a ""coordinated and multifaceted effort."" ""The success of our efforts to reduce the flow of drugs is largely dependent on our ability to reduce demand for them,"" Kerlikowske said, calling the nation's drug problem one of ""human suffering."" ""It requires prosecutors and law enforcement, courts, treatment providers and prevention programs to exchange information and to work together. And our priority should be a seamless, comprehensive approach,"" he said. In meeting with Calderon on Thursday, Obama tried to show Mexico's president that he is committed to ending a crisis that hits so close to home. Obama vowed to beef up security along the border and to work to slow the flow of guns and drugs. He said the United States shares responsibility for the drug problem, saying ""a demand for these drugs in the United States is what is helping to keep these cartels in business."" But he also tried to limit expectations that there could be any sort of quick fix. ""Now, are we going to eliminate all drug flows? Are we going to eliminate all guns coming over the border? That's not a realistic objective,"" he said. ""What is a realistic objective is to reduce it so significantly, so drastically that it becomes once again a localized criminal problem, as opposed to a major structural problem that threatens stability in communities along those borders."" The White House has listened to those who say legalizing marijuana will pull the rug from under the violent cartels in Mexico and boost the U.S. economy, but that option is not on the table. Asked Thursday if that is something realistic, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano quickly responded, ""No, it is not."" Sixty percent of drug criminals sent to prison re-offend, compared to 17 percent of graduates of drug court, according to the National Association of Drug Court Professionals. Drug policy experts like those numbers, but say the nation needs more treatment options. ""For individuals who don't have the resources, don't have public health insurance, can't afford it themselves, the single best way that they can access treatment is to get arrested,"" said Ryan King, a policy analyst with the Sentencing Project. ""And that's wrong. What we need to do is make sure for every American that is abusing drugs and wants to stop, that they have the resources made available to them, regardless of whether they can afford them.""

"Istanbul (CNN) -- A trial opened in Turkey on Tuesday against four Israeli military officers accused of commanding a botched raid against a Gaza-bound aid ship called the Mavi Marmara, which resulted in the death of nine activists. There was no legal representation for the four Israeli military commanders, who are being tried in absentia. Israel denounced the court case, calling it a Kafkaesque ""show trial"" that ""has nothing to do with law or justice."" Read more: Turkey kicking out top Israeli diplomats over Gaza blockade . ""The 'accused' have not been served, summoned, notified or informed in any way that they are going to be charged, or what the charges against them may be,"" wrote Yigal Palmor, a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry, in an e-mail to CNN. ""There has not even been the slightest symbolic attempt to allow the 'accused' to receive legal representation,"" he added. Hundreds of demonstrators rallied outside the recently constructed Caglayan Justice Palace in Istanbul on Tuesday, chanting ""Murderer Israel! Get out of Palestine!"" Inside, the courtroom was packed with plaintiffs, lawyers and observers. Read more: Israeli raid on Gaza-bound flotilla remembered . Turkish prosecutors accuse the four now retired Israeli senior military officials with ""instigating murder with cruelty,"" ""instigating maiming with a weapon"" and ""instigating torture."" In their testimony, several plaintiffs described mistreatment after the May 2010 raid. They also said Israeli troops used excessive force against unarmed civilians. Among the plaintiffs testifying in court Tuesday was retired U.S. Army Col. Ann Wright, who was a passenger on a ship in the convoy that sought to break through the Israeli blockade around Gaza in May 2010. Speaking outside the court, Wright said she witnessed the Israeli military take over the Mavi Marmara from a different ship in the flotilla. She also described her own experience in Israeli custody. ""They did everything to intimidate and humiliate us,"" Wright said. Read more: Flotilla raid 'regrettable' but legal, Israeli commission finds . ""If there is a judgment against these four people, then it really sends the signal to other Israeli officials that if you implement the criminal policies of your government that are violations of your own laws as well as international laws, then you may be held accountable. And that is a major move. That's really big,"" she said. Present at the trial Tuesday were officials from the Humanitarian Relief Foundation, a Turkish Islamist charity organization widely known by its Turkish acronym IHH. The IHH owns the Mavi Marmara and played a key role in the failed 2010 aid convoy to Gaza. Read more: Israel probing claims of flotilla ship thefts . ""This is a historical trial. Finally the Israelis are being tried in front of a judge,"" said Huseyin Oruc, Deputy Chairman of the IHH. ""It is a very emotional thing,"" Oruc said. ""It is a big honor because in a way, this is about representing all the people who are hurt by Israel's policies."" The trial in absentia of the four Israeli commanders highlights the lingering rupture in relations between Turkey and Israel, two Middle Eastern countries that were once close military allies. Turkish-Israeli ties were already strained before the bloody night in May 2010, when Israeli commandos rappelled from hovering helicopters onto the deck of the Mavi Marmara. Since then, Turkey has cut military ties and withdrawn its ambassador from Israel in protest. Ankara is also demanding an apology and reparations for the eight Turks and one Turkish-American citizen killed on board the Mavi Marmara. Turkey says the ship was in international waters when the commandos boarded it by force, killing the nine passengers. Israel says the organized resistance of armed passengers aboard the Mavi Marmara justified the use of deadly force. Turkish legal experts said since the four Israeli defendants are being tried in absentia and since Israeli does not appear to recognize the trial, the Istanbul Bar Association Is likely to assign Turkish attorneys to represent the defendants. CNN's Ivan Watson in Istanbul and Kareem Khadder in Jerusalem contributed to this report.","The four officers are being tried in absentia; Israel: ""show trial ... has nothing to do"" with justice .

"(CNN) -- Joyful supporters cheered as President Barack Obama stepped out to speak at his victory party in Chicago in the early hours of Wednesday, thanking them and millions of voters for allowing him another four years to lead the nation forward. ""Tonight, in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back, and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America, the best is yet to come,"" he told them. When Obama finished, the first family and Vice President Joe Biden and his family joined him onstage in a celebration of waves and hugs amid a blizzard of confetti. But despite the happiness and relief, the mood was perhaps more subdued than that experienced by those who were present for the wild celebrations four years earlier in Grant Park. Nearly everyone in the room had worked to get the president re-elected, either making phone calls or knocking on doors, and as they eagerly awaited his remarks early Wednesday morning there seemed to be less of the dreamy optimism that surrounded the 2008 campaign. Those seated in the bleachers energetically waved tiny American flags, and those on the floor calmly mingled, cheering sporadically whenever networks called a state for the president. But gone were the chants of ""yes we can,"" replaced instead with chants of ""four more years,"" and the president's re-election message was echoed in conversations throughout the convention hall -- there's still more work to do. Gov. Mitt Romney's concession speech was played on the monitors flanking the stage, and the crowd cheered as the defeated challenger admitted that ""the nation chose another leader."" But it also cheered, albeit somewhat begrudgingly, when the president thanked campaign volunteers from both parties, saying, ""Whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign, you made your voice heard and you made a difference."" And when Obama talked of sitting down with his former rival ""to talk about where we can work together to move this country forward,"" there was scattered yet enthusiastic applause at the prospect of bipartisanship. After getting their pictures taken or recording some cell phone video, a few members of the audience floated toward the exits to beat the crowds, but the vast majority stayed through to the end. In conversations they expressed a conviction that the country is indeed moving in the right direction, but most admitted readily that the change they'd voted for would require more hard work. The president's final exit from the campaign stage had come more than 24 hours earlier. With the imposing Iowa State Capitol looming over a soggy crowd that bore near-freezing temperatures in windswept Des Moines, Obama made his last major appearance of the 2012 campaign to urge the more than 20,000 supporters to maintain the enthusiasm that first catapulted him from a fresh-faced senator to presidential front-runner nearly five years ago. Flanked by first lady Michelle Obama and rock star Bruce Springsteen, Obama's final bow just before midnight marked at long last the arrival of Election Day and the end of the president's last campaign -- 105 rallies after kicking off his re-election effort in Ohio and Virginia seven months prior. How Obama got to 270 electoral votes . And when Air Force One touched down in Obama's hometown of Chicago 60 minutes later, the president's role as a candidate was all but done. On Election Day itself, Obama largely lay low, as has long been his practice when it comes time for voters to head to the polls. That's not to say the president closed the book on entirely on his re-election effort. Obama sat for a string of satellite interviews with television stations in battleground states in a final effort to get his message out, including two each in Iowa, Ohio and Florida -- states the president's campaign particularly focused on. Markets in Nevada and Colorado also got interviews. And in the afternoon, the president sat for an additional six interviews in yet more battleground markets. The president also turned up at a campaign field office in Chicago on Tuesday to shake hands with volunteers. ""I just want to say how grateful Michelle and I am for all the families, all the communities who have welcomed us, into their homes in some cases, into the neighborhoods, and have in some cases worked so hard on our behalf,"" the president said at the stop. ""The great thing about these campaigns is after all the TV ads and all the fundraising and all the debates and all the electioneering. It comes down to this, one day, and these incredible folks who are working so hard,"" he said. But for all intents and purposes, Obama remained largely out of sight Tuesday, containing whatever nerves he felt behind closed doors surrounded by friends, family and a circle of advisers who have been with him since the early days of his 2008 presidential race. A heavy dose of nostalgia and reflection was in the air, given that whatever the result Obama would never run for political office again. Some of the president's senior advisers, including David Axelrod and David Plouffe, were spotted wearing Obama 2008 fleece jackets Monday. Meanwhile, other veterans of the 2008 campaign, such as speechwriters Jon Favreau and Ben Rhodes, were also on hand for the president's final sprint. The 2012 campaign in 27 tweets . ""It's like the end of a long-running series, and all the characters are coming back,"" Axelrod mused. Perhaps with an eye toward recreating some of 2008's magic, Obama reconvened a game of pickup basketball that he got in the habit of playing every Election Day during that year's drawn out primary process. Senior campaign aide Robert Gibbs said instructions were sent several days ago to Reggie Love, the president's former body man and frequent basketball companion, to organize an Election Day game. The game kicked off shortly after 2 p.m. at the Attack Athletics facility in downtown Chicago. A White House aide said that in addition to Love, ""friends and staff"" were participating in the game, including Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Obama friend Mike Ramos. Kamarck: Five things Obama must do . ""I think it's safe all rituals will be observed,"" said Gibbs, who also noted that the one time the president didn't play basketball on an Election Day was when he had a surprise loss to Hillary Clinton in the 2008 New Hampshire primary. ""We won't make that mistake again,"" he joked. Kennedy: Obama's win won't transform America . One thing the president did not do Tuesday was visit any additional battleground states, the campaign's traveling press secretary Jen Psaki said, even as Romney went out to meet and greet voters in Ohio and Pennsylvania until polls closed. That was a calculated decision not to get in the way of the campaign's get-out-the-vote efforts in the battleground states, said Stephan Cutter, a senior adviser to the campaign. ""On Election Day, the last thing you want to do is take your GOTV staff off from getting people out to the polls,"" she told CNN. Instead, the president was aware his fate was largely out of his hands and instead in those of the thousands of grassroots operatives and volunteers who are charged with getting voters to the polls across the country. Speaking to a Virginia crowd Saturday night, Obama mused that he now felt like a ""prop"" because there was little left he could do with so few hours remaining until voters issued their final judgment. ""It's up to the volunteers,"" he told the Virginia crowd. ""It's up to somebody knocking on a door. It's up to somebody making a phone call."" Share your reaction to the results . Ultimately, the president spent the majority of his time Tuesday simply trying to stay at ease with a close circle that includes the first lady and old friends such as Martin Nesbitt and Marvin Nicholson. He also put the finishing touches on two speeches -- one for a victory, and the other for the eventuality that he lost. And just as the first wave of results flowed in, the president sat down to dinner with the first lady, his two daughters and mother-in-law -- all of whom flew in from Washington earlier in the evening. At that final rally in Iowa on Monday night, Bruce Springsteen ended his 30-minute concert with his classic, ""In the Land of Hopes and Dreams,"" crooning, ""Well, you don't know where you're goin' now, but you know you won't be back."" It was a fitting end for a president who didn't yet know if he'd hold on to White House but could be certain his days as a candidate were forever over. Obama: My vision for America .

"Phoenix, Arizona (CNN) -- When America's financial institutions crumbled and housing values plummeted, cities and families across the nation felt the tremendous impact. Almost overnight, the reality of how we live our lives and govern our communities shifted dramatically. To make matters worse, no road map to help us navigate these new and troubled waters was delivered to our doorstep. It had to be created. Endless dialogue and analysis about whether or not the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) is working has become a cottage industry among economists, professors and political commentators. The debate of whether or not the stimulus has in fact ""stimulated"" our economy will continue for months, and possibly years to come. But the picture in Phoenix, Arizona, is clear: Because of ARRA, key projects are under way, our environment is improving -- and thousands of people are going back to work. Meet James Ceaton. Phoenix has more than 300 days of sunshine a year, so it doesn't surprise anyone to learn that a key to our local economy is tourism. Moving individuals in and out of Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport efficiently is critical to our economy. At a time when our economy had slowed to a point where new infrastructure projects did not seem possible, the city was awarded $11.7 million from ARRA to reconstruct a taxiway at the airport. Until now, the taxiway was able to handle only small aircraft and ground vehicles. When complete, it will be capable of moving large commercial aircraft between the north runway and the terminals at Sky Harbor. Ceaton is a construction worker who was hired for the job. ""Without the stimulus,"" he told the Phoenix Business Journal, ""I would still be out of a job."" Because of the stimulus, though, he continues to work, to support a family, to pay a mortgage and to make purchases that contribute to our economy. Meet the Lovato family. While cities on the East Coast struggle to keep utility bills low for residents during cold winter months, our hot summer months can cause a significant economic burden on Phoenix residents. The Lovato family in central Phoenix was the first family of 1,200 households that will benefit from the city's $7.2 million ARRA weatherization grant during the next three years. Weatherizing the Lovatos' home is expected to shave 30 percent to 40 percent from the family's $440 monthly energy bill. The project also employed six full-time and a dozen part-time workers. Scott Lovato, who lives with his wife, Angela, and two children, Christian, 13 and Sarai, 11, commented, ""At a time when the economy really stinks and people were out of work, a lot of people were working on this,"" he said. ""This put paychecks in their pockets so they could feed their families. I think that is probably the best thing out of all of this."" Meet Jeanne Simons. Simons is a seventh- and eighth-grade teacher at Gateway School in Phoenix. Last year, she was told that if ARRA funds were not approved, she would lose her teaching position. If her position had been eliminated, the remaining teachers would have faced class sizes of between 40 and 50 students -- a daunting task for any educator to face. Ceaton, the Lovato family and Simons are only three of the thousands of Phoenicians who continue to be employed and contribute to our economy. And they, and we, have the ARRA to thank for it.

"(CNN) -- Ali-Frazier. Leonard-Duran. Gatti-Ward. Zale-Graziano. Most of boxing's great rivalries produced three memorable fights, trilogies of spectacular action. They were entertaining fights that demanded sequels, then sequels that demanded sequels. Rare is the case when it takes a fourth fight to satisfy the fighters, the fans and the press. Boxers often have other rivals to battle, and younger fighters come along deserving their shots. But for Manny Pacquiao (54-4-2, 38 KOs) and Juan Manuel Marquez (54-6-1, 39 KOs), their legacies require one more battle in the ring, a fourth fight that will give one a chance to finally hear his name pronounced the winner and a match that could allow the other to push aside the controversial decisions of the past. That comes Saturday night at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas when the two meet in a non-title fight. Pacquiao has, in the eyes of the judges, won two of the previous matches. The first was ruled a tie. He believes he won all three. Marquez fervently believes he won all three. Public sentiment and the opinion of sports media fall mostly in the middle. Roach: Beaten Marquez deserves fourth Pacquaio fight . What everyone agrees on is that the fights have been great. Pacquiao comes hard after Marquez, who counterpunches superbly. Pacquiao has knocked Marquez down four times, three of which came in the first round of the first fight. Had the referee stopped the fight, as they often do after a boxer falls three times, the trilogy would have been a quick one-night stand, or one-night fall, as it were. Now the two fighters are forever linked. Marquez, 39, thinks that even though they are fierce rivals now, that might change. He told reporters they might even become friends. ""Because of the great rivalry we had in the ring. I have nothing against him except for the decisions,"" Marquez, who is Mexican, said, according to an interpreter. ""I don't see why we can't have a personal relationship and not just a professional relationship."" But on HBO's 24/7 documentary series, he admits there is some animosity, at least on his part. ""As professionals, we respect each other,"" Marquez said. ""But after everything that's happened, it's starting to get personal. It's heavier. There's more anger. That's how the fourth fight will be."" The soft-spoken Pacquiao, a Filipino legend, always carefully chooses his words. ""I never hate my opponent outside of the ring,"" he said. ""It is just my job to fight, and there is nothing personal. I guess we are kind of friends because I look at all of my opponents as a friend."" Pacquiao's last fight gave him a taste of what Marquez has felt during the reading of the scorecards for their battles. It appeared Pacquiao dominated Timothy Bradley in a 12-round welterweight title fight in June, but he lost the decision on two of the three judges' scorecards. Naturally everyone predicted a fall rematch, but it didn't materialize. It has a lot to do with money, as Marquez is a better name on the marquee and Saturday's fight stands to draw more viewers to pay per view. According to Yahoo Sports, Pacquiao stands to make at least $8 million guaranteed and as much as $30 million if the pay-per-view sells well. Marquez is guaranteed $3 million, Yahoo reported. Pacquiao, 33, is more diplomatic about why he is fighting Marquez instead of Bradley. ""I am giving him a chance. I am giving him a chance to prove he can win the fight because he thought he has won all three and he keeps talking about it,"" he said. ""So it is very important to me to win this fight, especially since Marquez really wanted this fight."" 'Pacman' loss leaves Philippines fans stunned . Some people have speculated that despite two previous wins, Pacquiao might need a clear victory over Marquez this time to avoid the judges rewarding him for past perceived injustice. Pacquiao's long-time trainer Freddie Roach has even said that they can't win if they don't get a knockout. At a press conference announcing the fight, Pacquiao used his thumb to scratch into the tablecloth, ""We need to win by knockout"" for Roach to see. ""I said, 'Yes, we do,'"" Roach said. ""That is the best news I've seen yet. Usually it's God will decide or it'll be a close fight or I'm not going to predict anything. ""And the thing is, who is going to give Manny Pacquiao the fourth fight if it's another close call?"" Marquez said he also feels the need to knockout his opponent to clearly win. He won't change his style, but he said he will fight ""with intelligence"" and more aggression, Marquez said. Roach said his fighter will make sure the pace is more up-tempo. ""I think it's going to be a sensational fight. Juan is the most difficult fighter that Manny Pacquiao has ever faced,"" Marquez's trainer, Nacho Beristain, said.","Fourth fight in Pacquiao-Marquez battle will give one a chance to proclaim himself the winner .
The first three fights resulted in a draw and two close wins for Manny Pacquiao .

(Prices vary; silvacompass.com) In an age of mobile GPS, compasses can seem like an affectation -- except when traveling where a mobile phone or car can't go. That's where something like the small, sturdy design of a Silva Compass comes in handy: The colder months bring their own set of challenges when hiking or exploring on foot, but they can bring rewards as well. After the holiday, spend the next few months prepping to hike the Appalachian Trail in Georgia, at its southern end, just as spring approaches in early March.

"(CNN) -- Mali's prime minister abruptly resigned Tuesday on state television, a day after he was arrested by a group of soldiers loyal to a former coup leader. The development is another blow to the stability of a country once hailed as a model of democracy in Africa, but one derailed by a coup and an uprising of Islamist militants. Cheick Modibo Diarra, a former NASA engineer, who holds U.S. citizenship, was set to fly to Paris for medical care Monday, when he received notice that his bags had been removed from the plane, said a close aide, who did not want to be named. Diarra decided to stay home, where three pick-up trucks with armed soldiers pulled up at 11:00 p.m. and took him away to military headquarters in Kati, five miles north of the capital Bamako, the official said. There he met with former coup leader Capitaine Amadou Sanogo. Armed soldiers brought the former prime minister to broadcaster ORTM around 1 a.m., said TV technician Adama Haidara. ""Mr. Diarra looked tired, worn out,"" he said. The soldiers gave him a statement to read. ""I cannot say if he was forced,"" Haidara said. ""He looked unharmed."" In his televised appearance on the military controlled broadcaster, Diarra did not offer a reason for his resignation, except for a vague statement that he solemnly delivered. ""Our country Mali is going through the most difficult period in its history,"" he said. ""During this time of crisis, the men and women of this country -- uncertain of what is going to happen to their country -- find themselves in an unfortunate situation. ""That's why I, Cheikh Modibo Diarra, have resigned with all my government, on this day, Tuesday, 11 of December of 2012."" Diarra's whereabouts are yet unknown, but his aide believes he is still in Bamako. ""He was not injured when the military arrested him last night,"" he said, ""but he has not come into his office today."" ""The arrest was made by a small force loyal to Sanogo,"" said army spokesperson Colonel Idrissa Traore. ""The majority of the military officers in Bamako were not informed about the arrest of Mr. Diarra, and no one knows what will happen now,"" he said. Mali held its first democratic elections in 1992 after decades of military rule, and had a strong democracy for the most part. That was until March, when a group of soldiers toppled the government, which it accused of not providing adequate equipment to battle ethnic Tuareg rebels roaming the vast desert in the north. The president disappeared from sight. The Tuareg rebels took advantage of the power vacuum and seized parts of the north. They have always wanted independence, and have staged several rebellions since the 1960s. After Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was killed and Libya plunged into chaos, Tuaregs, who had fought by his side, took weapons to Mali to ramp up their conquest. A power struggle erupted between the Tuaregs and local al Qaeda-linked radicals -- including Ansar Dine -- who prevailed and seized control of two-thirds of northern Mali, an area the size of France. The international community is also worried that al Qaeda's north African wing is expanding into Mali. U.S. officials have said that the wing, the al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, is linked to the deadly Benghazi attack that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three others. Tuareg rebels have retreated from the well-armed militants, but have vowed to fight back and establish their own country in the north, which they call Azawad. And as the world seeks a solution, the Islamist militants are busy applying their strict interpretation of sharia law, including the banning of music, smoking, drinking and watching sports on television. They also publicly stoned a couple to death in July for reportedly having an affair. Public executions, amputations, floggings and other inhuman punishments are becoming common, the United Nations says. At least four times this year, the militants have destroyed Timbuktu's historic tombs and shrines, claiming the relics are idolatrous. The picturesque city was once an important destination for Islamic scholars for its ancient and prominent burial sites and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. West African states and international leaders say a rapid military intervention is essential to solving the security crisis. When soldiers seized the capital, the regional and international powers put pressure on them to restore democratic rule. Sanogo conceded and transferred power to interim President Dioncounda Traore, who was appointed by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Traore appointed Diarra interim prime minister. Traore fled to a Paris hotel after being beaten unconscious in a May 21 attack that occurred in the presidential palace. Prime Minister Diarra took over the country's leadership until Traore returned.

"(CNN) -- Mainstream America was supposed to get to know Jenni Rivera in the coming months, but not like this. Not because of her tragic death in a plane crash at just 43 years old. The Mexican-American singer, who died in Mexico on Sunday, had recently signed a deal with ABC to star in a sitcom about a single mom with quirky parenting skills who juggles family and business: a reflection of her real life. It would have been a chance for the country to get to know a remarkable superstar and woman who was talented, refreshingly down to earth and even inspiring. Rivera had a big voice, a big personality and an undeniably big presence, whether she was onstage, belting out songs about heartache in traditional Mexican dress or a sexy leather outfit, or off it, talking openly about her personal struggles and success. She was a luchadora, or fighter, who had overcome considerable personal strife, and she drew on her strength to climb to the top of a Latin music genre dominated by men. She started out in music as a young mother and eventually became a mogul who sold more than 15 million albums worldwide, including 1.2 million albums and nearly 350,000 digital tracks stateside; sold out venues like the Staples Center in Los Angeles and had a bilingual TV show, a radio program, several businesses, a foundation for battered women and millions of followers online. Fans and our readers -- Latina magazine first put her on the cover in May 2011 -- connected not just to her background as the daughter of immigrants who made something of herself, but her openness: She was neither perfect nor pretended to be so. She once brawled with a fan, but later made amends and invited the fan to an all-expenses paid trip. She had run-ins with the law and rocky relationships: She was married three times and was divorcing former Major League Baseball pitcher Esteban Loaiza at the time of her death. ""I'm not faking it in any way,"" she told us last year about her life as reflected in her show, ""I Love Jenni,"" which aired on the Latino-aimed bilingual cable network mun2, adding that she wanted fans to ""see the human being behind the celebrity name, the lights and sold-out concerts."" Instead, Latino journalists like me are left to introduce her to a larger audience by writing about her in the past tense. Hearing the news of her death on Sunday, I couldn't help but think of another star, Tejano singer Selena, who was poised to make an impact on American culture when she was killed 17 years ago. In both cases, we not only mourn the artist, but the moment, the lost opportunity to have one of us tell his or her own story beyond songs. But at least we'll always have those.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court ruled Monday that two men convicted of killings committed when they were 14 cannot be sentenced to life in prison without at least the possibility of parole. The 5-4 ruling is a victory for defenders of juvenile offenders, affirming recent high court rulings against harsh criminal sentences. Justice Elena Kagan said it would be wrong for states to ignore the chance that these now-adult inmates may someday be rehabilitated. ""The mandatory sentencing schemes before us violate this principle of proportionality, and so violate the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment,"" Kagan said. Justices mull whether life without parole appropriate for underage killers . The high court in 2005 banned the death penalty for those under 18 who commit aggravated murder. Then, five years later, the justices said juveniles found guilty of non-homicides could not receive life without parole. The spotlight has now turned on the youngest of killers and the question of whether a national consensus has developed to treat them differently regarding a lifetime of incarceration. The separate appeals involved an Alabama boy who, with an accomplice, robbed a neighbor and then beat the man to death and set his house on fire; and an Arkansas youth who was part of a group of teens who robbed a video store where the clerk was blasted to death with a shotgun. Both defendants are now adults serving their sentences. Both were tried and convicted as adults and received the minimum sentences allowed under state law for felony capital murder. About 2,500 prisoners are serving life sentences without parole for crimes committed as juveniles, at least 79 of whom were 14 years or younger at the time, according to the Equal Justice Initiative, which is representing the two men before the high court. In his argument to the court, Attorney Bryan Stevenson had urged the justices not to ""give up"" on child offenders, who he said are fundamentally different from adults. He said that while they must be held accountable for their actions, youths are also works in progress, emotionally and developmentally. Stevenson said firmly that all those under 18 at the time of their crimes deserve the chance for parole someday. He said the often-terrible facts of a murder can overwhelm any mitigating factors like a defendant's age, especially for jurors who may be unaware that a young person's brain and self-control are often not fully developed, and their living environment can play a role as well. ""You would say that a person of 17 years and 11 months who commits the worst possible string of offenses -- and demonstrates great maturity -- still cannot be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole?"" asked Alito during oral arguments in March. He wrote the tough dissenting opinion, supported by Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. ""When the majority of this court countermands that democratic decision (by state legislatures), what the majority is saying is that members of society must be exposed to the risk that these convicted murders, if released from custody, will murder again,"" said Alito, who delivered his dissent from the bench, a rare privilege typically granted in only the most contentious of cases. Alabama Solicitor General John Neiman told the court that states deserve discretion to set punishments for the worst of offenders, even teenagers. Complicating matters, several justices at argument noted differences between the two cases before them. Neiman said the murder committed by Evan Miller in Alabama was especially ""gruesome."" The boy and his accomplice had smoked marijuana with the victim in his trailer. The 52-year-old man burned to death after the mobile home was set ablaze. In Kuntrell Jackson's case, he was outside acting as a lookout when the Chickasaw County, Arkansas, robbery took place. It was a 15-year-old boy who shot the female clerk when she refused to turn over money. The actual shooter later pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life with the possibility of parole. Stevenson said there was a real question whether Jackson had an ""intent to kill"" during the botched robbery, perhaps allowing for a lesser sentence. But Arkansas Assistant Attorney General Kent Holt said the sentence of life without parole was still appropriate, arguing the defendant could have received the death penalty if he had been an adult at the time of the crime. ""A legislative judgment has been made with regard to drawing a baseline for all murderers, whether they are juvenile murderers, whether they are getaway drivers,"" Holt said. ""And when you counsel or aid or do anything that gets you liability for being a capital murderer, then that is the minimum sentence"" -- life without parole, with no exceptions. The cases are Miller v. Alabama (10-9646) and Jackson v. Hobbs (10-9647).

"(CNN) -- A man fatally injured one person, then burst into a Wyoming college class Friday morning to kill another person and, ultimately, himself, police said. According to Casper police, ""there were no firearms involved in the crime(s), and the (victims') injuries were caused by a sharp-edged weapon."" It was not immediately clear how the three people -- one of whom was a Casper College faculty member -- were killed. ""I've been a college administrator for about 40 years, (and) I can say without a doubt this is the worst day of my career,"" said college President Walter Nolte. Police Chief Chris Walsh did not immediately identify the three dead but said one was a woman and two were men, including the suspect. All of them knew each other, he added. Authorities got their first call shortly after 9 a.m. MT (11 a.m. ET) about ""a traumatic injury on the campus of Casper College."" About 33 law enforcement officers from various agencies arrived within minutes, according to Walsh. Casper College subsequently went on lockdown, as did the Natrona County Schools, as authorities tried to ascertain what happened. As they canvassed the Wold Physical Science Center building, officers found two dead bodies in a third-floor classroom, the police chief said. Meanwhile, two minutes after that first call, police learned of another ""traumatic injury"" at a site off-campus. Police are working under the assumption that this death is related to the other two and that the man behind all the violence is dead. ""There is no one at large, and there's no threat of violence or anything like that,"" Walsh told reporters early Friday afternoon. The police chief said the suspect was not a current Casper College student, although he didn't elaborate or explain how the three dead knew each other. Walsh did say ""the suspect appeared to be completely alone.""","3 are dead at two separate, but related crime scenes, according to police .

"(CNN) -- The defense team for George Zimmerman -- charged with murder in 17-year-old Trayvon Martin's death -- continued their offensive Friday, pressing in court for access to information they hope will shed light on what happened and exonerate the Florida man. In an interview Thursday with ""InSession's"" Jean Casarez, Zimmerman's lawyer Mark O'Mara previewed the court action and reiterated the position that Martin, and not his client, was the aggressor in the February 26 incident. ""We will have a ... trial, and if that trial is fair, he's going to be acquitted,"" O'Mara said, ruling out a deal in which his client pleads guilty to lesser charges. While driving through his Sanford, Florida, neighborhood that winter night, Zimmerman spotted Trayvon Martin, whom he described on a 911 call as ""suspicious."" A dispatcher told the 28-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer not to follow Martin, but he did anyway. After an altercation, the unarmed African-American teenager was shot dead. Weeks after the incident, the case drew national media attention, and activists demanded an arrest. On April 11, Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder. Defense lawyers have steadfastly maintained their client's innocence, saying Zimmerman was badly beaten and acted in self-defense. They have challenged key pieces of the prosecution's case. One of the most potentially pivotal pieces deals with a 911 call from that night in which someone can be heard screaming for help. The thinking is that the person pleading for assistance -- whether it was Martin or Zimmerman -- was on the defensive, and the other was the aggressor. A defense motion filed Monday in Seminole County court, which the prosecution replied to Friday, asks that Zimmerman's lawyers be allowed to question for a second time Sanford police investigator William Erwin. Zimmerman's lawyers claim that Erwin overheard the late teen's father say the screaming voice was not that of his son. The father, Tracy Martin, has said he is ""positive"" the pleading voice is that of Trayvon. In a response Friday, Assistant State's Attorney Bernardo de la Rionda criticized the defense's arguments and said Erwin ""never mentioned anything about overhearing Tracy Martin talk about the voice."" But the lead prosecutor didn't object to O'Mara and other lawyers deposing Erwin. Additionally, Zimmerman's defense team filed several new documents Friday. One asks that the prosecution ""disclose all witnesses known to the state who claim to be familiar with Trayvon Martin's or George Zimmerman's voice that have heard"" the 911 call. Zimmerman sues NBC Universal over edited 911 call . Another motion asks the court to force Benjamin Crump, the Martin family's attorney, to turn over the original recording and recording device that he used to first interview the late teenager's girlfriend. Asserting that the young woman can prove Martin was killed ""in cold blood,"" Crump said in March that the girlfriend ""completely blows Zimmerman's absurd self-defense claim out of the water."" But defense lawyer Don West said Thursday that the recordings he's aware of are a ""copy of a copy that's disjointed and chopped and obvious that it was edited."" On Friday, Crump said he has already turned over the tape. ""The phone records speak for themselves,"" the lawyer said. ""She tells him to run. He runs. And then, when you go through the 911 tape, George Zimmerman admits that he is pursuing Trayvon."" Zimmerman filed a different motion Friday, asking that he be allowed to remove his GPS monitor and leave Seminole County without the court's permission. The document alleges that Zimmerman and his wife have lived ""in fear of violence at the hands of those who would wish (him) harm based on their misinterpretation of the events."" These and other court filings Friday follow other moves by Zimmerman's team in recent days to raise questions in court and in public about the prosecution's case. The next hearing in the case is set for December 11. Last week, they released a photo of a bloodied Zimmerman taken a few minutes after Martin was shot dead. On Thursday, they filed a lawsuit against NBC for a report that O'Mara claims portrays his client as a racist and murderer; the lawyer called it ""one shining example of what was done wrong to George."" ""They took an event and made it highly inflammatory,"" said O'Mara of the NBC report that, according to the lawsuit, selectively edits audio of Zimmerman's 911 call to make him sound racist. ""They wanted to be first, and ... they wanted to have the most sensational headline of that day. And they just did it. They just presumed, I think, ... they had a racist."" Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, is accused of fatally shooting Martin, who was African-American. NBC Universal disputed the accusations and issued a statement saying: ""There was no intent to portray Mr. Zimmerman unfairly. We intend to vigorously defend our position in court."" CNN's George Howell and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","George Zimmerman is charged with murder in the death of Trayvon Martin, 17 .
His lawyers want to loosen restrictions on Zimmerman, saying he lives in fear .

"(CNN) -- In the radio biz, if the buzz is good, the listeners will come. But now a suicide that followed an Australian radio prank is forcing American radio broadcasters to look in the mirror. ""It was a feeding frenzy last week when the prank first happened,"" said Paige Nienaber, a radio consultant for about 100 stations. ""We thought, 'This is the greatest thing ever!' Then, of course, it became a tragedy."" Although the story is Topic A on U.S. airwaves, where pranks and stunts are all too common, it's hard to know what's being said off the air -- when studio microphones are not live. The blame is widespread, says 40-plus-year radio veteran Bruce Kelly. ""Most of the industry people I've talked to are saying it's not the DJs' fault. But it does make radio as a whole look pretty stupid."" Nurse Jacintha Saldanha's apparent suicide after Australian DJs Mel Greig and Michael Christian fooled her into thinking they were Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles has triggered American station owners to take a new look at their policies concerning pranks and stunts, industry insiders say. ""There is no way they could have anticipated this,"" said Nienaber. Now station owners, he said, are reviewing policy and reminding their talent to toe the line when it comes to stunts and pranks. ""My advice: it's a tragedy, but just calm down."" ""The DJs should not blame themselves,"" wrote CNN commenter Marci Richardson, who described herself as a paralegal. ""No one commits suicide over a prank."" But another commenter, identifying as yokohamacat, wrote that ""without their prank, she would probably be alive now. DJs can not go claiming total innocence as long as there is a clear sequence of suicide and the prank call."" Related story: Prank call radio station donates to nurse's family . When it comes to prank phone calls on American radio -- believe it or not -- there are rules. In fact, the Aussie prank never would have happened in the United States, broadcasters say, because the FCC dictates that anyone featured on air must give their permission before their voice is broadcast. Some stations take this so seriously that they produce fake prank phone calls by hiring impromptu actors to play the roles of unwitting listeners. Radio has been successful partly because it has realized April Fool's Day doesn't have to happen once a year, Nienaber said. He should know. The stunts he's helped stations promote are creative to say the least. --Hundreds of listeners were fooled into thinking they were appearing in a Brad Pitt movie. --A station promoted a ""baby giveaway"" contest by offering the winning couple free treatments for in vitro fertilization. --A contest dubbed Swap Your Wife for a Brand New Life offered several couples prizes after they switched partners. The tragedy has morning shows nationwide thinking twice. ""Those of us in the media forget the impact we have on people's lives, both positive and negative,"" Kelly said. ""Personally, I think anytime you publicly embarrass someone it doesn't sit well with me,"" said 31-year radio veteran Kevin Robinson, who programs 106-5 The Arch in St. Louis. Related story: Opinion: DJs broke 'no harm' rule . Is there a line that should not be crossed? ""The line is, don't do it if it endangers the public directly,"" Kelly said. The suicide dredges up memories of an American radio stunt that ended tragically: a 2007 contest that left 28-year-old Jennifer Strange dead from acute water intoxication. Strange entered the contest sponsored by Sacramento, California, station KDND. The contest promised a free Wii video game system to the person who could drink the most water without going to the bathroom or vomiting. Promoters dubbed the contest, ""Hold Your Wee for a Wii."" Strange's family was awarded $16.5 million in a wrongful death suit against the station owners. ""Sacramento really seemed to validate what a lot of people already believe: that we are this dangerous medium,"" said Nienaber. But he also calls it the ""intestinal gas, fart joke medium,"" because ""a lot of the people are emotionally stuck in the eighth grade."" People who own radio stations, he says, see DJs as ""children playing with explosives."" What's the payoff for radio pranks? In a word, buzz. Pressure from programmers often forces talent to go to extremes to ""make noise"" in the market, insiders say. Get listeners talking. What about ratings? Are pranks a direct result of trying to win a ratings war? Not necessarily. ""I don't think there's a correlation,"" Nienaber said. DJs would devise pranks regardless, he says. ""At the end of the day, it's just fun."" But like every medium these days, radio is changing. Will the Aussie DJ's scandal leave a permanent mark? Will your favorite morning DJs change their tune in the aftermath of the tragedy? ""I don't think radio pranks will ever go away as long as there are 'funny' morning shows,"" said Lee Abrams, an industry pioneer and consultant who's legendary in the business. ""The Australian prank was a fluke ... though the hosts and their employers will probably think twice"" in the future ""and that's probably a good thing."" Phone pranks like the one in Australia have become ""old and boring"" Kelly said. Much of radio's fun with pranks has roots in the 1950s with shows like ""Candid Camera"" and in the '80s with Scott Shannon's ""Morning Zoo"" at New York's Z100. ""I think it was something that was happening more in the '80s and '90s,"" said Jim Denny, morning co-host at Indianapolis' WFMS. ""I think you hear more mean stuff on the sports radio and news-talk stations, where they're beating up on the listeners sometimes."" Pranks and stunts appear to be moving from radio to reality TV, Kelly said, leaving radio with a few basic formats that he calls ""shut-up-and-play-the music""; ""I-hate-Obama-I-love-Obama"" aka talk radio; or an ""ensemble of human interaction with Morning Zoo-like overtones, without the snarkyness."" If radio ends up becoming more predictable as a result of the controversy, it will disappoint many broadcasters as well as listeners. It's radio's unpredictability, they say, that makes it great. ""Anything can happen,"" Nienaber said. ""But should this stop us from doing everything? No.""","An Australian radio prank prompts U.S. broadcasters to re-evaluate .

"(CNN) -- While anxiously awaiting the September 30 season premiere of ""Homeland,"" you likely have a lot of remaining questions about season one: Will Carrie remember that Brody knew Issa? What happened to the Brody confession video? Why would someone eat peanut butter off a ruler? And of course: Did Jessica keep her hair short, the way Brody apparently ""always liked it?"" Morena Baccarin, who plays military wife and mother Jessica Brody on the Emmy-nominated Showtime hit, is featured in the October issue of Esquire magazine. In the piece, writer Tom Chiarella calls Baccarin ""the most beautiful woman in the world"" (six times), but notes that the actress' hair ""appears to be in transition, caught somewhere between Alien Queen and Weepy Soldier's Wife. ""What happened to the pixie cut she featured in her brief but epic run on the more recent resurrection of ""V?"" Chiarella asks. Baccarin, 33, explained to ""Esquire"" that after having had ""superlong"" hair ""forever,"" she took on a role that called for short hair and for years afterward volleyed between cutting it and wearing wigs. For the past four years, however, she's kept her locks super short -- in the pre-haircut ""Homeland"" episodes she's actually wearing a wig. Now, Baccarin said, she's ""growing it out for 'Homeland'."" How We First Got to Know Morena Baccarin... With entire online message boards devoted to Baccarin's hair, the consensus is this: the public is largely taken aback when a gorgeous woman sports a short haircut. In the December 2011 issue of Elle UK, actress Michelle Williams, who's worn a pixie-style cut for years, admitted ""straight men across the board are not into this hair! I cut it for the one straight man who has ever liked short hair and I wear it in memorial of somebody who really loved it."" Williams' cropped tresses are a tribute to the late actor Heath Ledger, with whom she has a daughter, Matilda. Incidentally, Williams said that 6-year-old Matilda would love to see her mom with long hair. Anne Hathaway's hair is currently in a pixie style, too, but she had to cut it in order to play Fantine, the terminally-ill prostitute who sells her hair in ""Les Miserables."" Hathaway told Kelly Ripa on ""Live!"" that the cut left her ""inconsolable,"" reducing her to ""mental patient-level crying."" What We Know About Homeland's Next Season . There are, of course, many beautiful actresses other than Baccarin, Williams and Hathaway who have successfully, if briefly, worn their hair short: Mia Farrow, Audrey Hepburn, Demi Moore, Winona Ryder and Emma Watson come to mind. That's not to say that there hasn't been a fair share of short hair backlash either. Remember when ""Felicity"" cut her hair short in season two of the eponymous college drama? If not, maybe you saw the ratings-fallout incident mentioned on ""Six Feet Under,"" ""Gilmore Girls,"" ""30 Rock"" or ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer."" With Baccarin's Jessica Brody transitioning into the political wife role, it'll be interesting to see viewer reaction to her hairstyle. What about you?

"(CNN) -- Derreck Kayongo is a Ugandan war refugee who started the Global Soap Project to help vulnerable communities fight disease. Based in Atlanta, the nonprofit has collected 100 tons of used soap from hotels in the United States and reprocessed it for shipment to impoverished nations. What started in 2009 as a one-man operation in his basement has grown into an effort that includes 300 hotels and hundreds of volunteers all over the country. The group now operates out of a donated warehouse. Kayongo recently spoke with CNN about how far he and his Global Soap Project have come and what he envisions for the future. CNN: What did it mean to you to personally deliver your group's first box of soap to orphans last summer? Kayongo: I became a refugee in Kenya, so it was important for me to be at the first delivery in Kenya with that soap. It's like going back home where you left so much plight and suffering, and going back and giving back. So many of us leave distressed areas and never look back. Having been blessed in the U.S., I knew I needed to give back. The soap means a lot (to the kids). It means somebody cares. This is a health issue, and we are trying to protect them from simple diseases that could kill them. It means health, and it also means hope. CNN: How does your process work? Kayongo: When the soaps come into the factory, we separate them by hotel. We don't mix the soaps up -- they have different smells, colors, chemistry. We inspect each bar, literally. We used to use a potato peeler to peel off anything of concern. Now we have a machine that's been outfitted with a gadget that will literally peel everything off and give us the inner piece. The machine breaks the pieces down into a dust, and then we take that out and add water, which gives a feta cheese texture. Then we put it back into the machine, which heats it up to about 250 degrees and compacts it. It comes out as a long bar that we cut into small bars -- either 4- or 6- or 8-ounce bars. ... Then we box the bars. We don't package them in plastic or small boxes -- we don't want to continue pollution. But before we ship them off, we take a bar at random and ship it to a lab and they test for pathogens. Once it comes back negative, we know that batch is safe and good to go. CNN: How does the soap get to the people who need it? Kayongo: We have partner organizations that work with us. They are already on the ground doing incredible work and know where the needs are for soap within the communities they serve. They serve very poor people. These organizations usually have containers of other aid going to the communities, and they pick up the soap from our warehouse and put it in their containers. It's a wonderful symbiotic relationship and a good way of using resources all around. Then (the soap) gets home, and the mamas and the kids start screaming. (They) dance. The soaps have different smells, different colors, and they're from beautiful hotels here. They're high-end soaps. You can imagine getting that soap. It's a remarkable gift. CNN: What are your future goals? Kayongo: I look forward to a day where we will become a full-fledged operation, where we have the money to make this professional. I want to be a soap depot where people who are under distress who need soap ... whenever there is a crisis globally, they can come to us and we can give them the soap. I don't want to ever see a child without soap. I don't want to see a mother give birth where the attendant didn't wash her hands. I want to put a bar of soap in every child's hand globally that cannot afford it. That's my goal.

"(CNN) -- Corporate India was surprised that the low-profile scion of an Indian construction tycoon will take over the nation's most high profile company after a 14-month search. Reaction across the Indian business press was one of surprise at the appointment of 43-year-old Cyrus Pallonji Mistry as the successor to business icon Ratan Tata, the man who has led the $80 billion conglomerate for the past two decades. Mistry was former head of Shapoorji Pallonji Group, a construction company. ""The first (impression) is wow! People looked at the possibility of Tata's half-brother succeeding him, but nobody looked at Mistry,"" Sunil Jain, opinion editor of the Financial Express, told India's MoneyControl. ""I think for all you know, he may turn out to be a good chief."" Mistry was named deputy chairman Wednesday, shadowing Tata for a year before officially taking the reins in December 2012. Mistry is expected to be named the sixth chairman since the company's founding in 1868. India's Tata Group names successor . It was widely expected that Tata's half brother, Noel Tata -- who is married to Mistry's sister -- would be named chairman. He is managing director of Tata International. Asked in an exclusive interview with CNN earlier this year what are the chances a Tata family member would replace him, the 73-year-old Ratan Tata said, ""My stepbrother is one of the candidates that is being considered and I don't think it's my lot to say whether it's 50%, or 90% or 10% (chance)."" The Tata Sons holding company has about 100 companies sprawled under the Tata umbrella -- stretching across 80 countries in fields as diverse as automotive, energy, business consulting, steel, IT and telecommunications sectors -- with annual revenues of $83 billion. Under Ratan Tata, the group aggressively expanded overseas, and now owns the Jaguar and Land Rover brands, as well as European steelmaker Corus Steel and Tetley Tea. The company made history in 2009 with the production of the Nano, the world's cheapest car. The group also owns the Taj group of hotels, including the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower in Mumbai which was at the center of the deadly 2008 terrorist attacks. Tata is a bachelor with no children. He took over the family business in 1991 and has been credited for pioneering different markets and turning ""Tata"" into a household name. The decision was announced by a five-member selection committee that once included Mistry, who left the committee after he became a candidate for the job. ""For some it is a welcome move and for some others it is a case of a selector becoming the selected,"" wrote the Hindu Business Line. Mistry's family business, led by his construction tycoon father, Pallonji Mistry, is the largest single shareholder in Tata Sons with an 18.4% equity stock. Most of the company's stock is controlled by Tata family philanthropic trust funds. Mistry's father has an estimated net worth of $8.8 billion, according to Forbes. The younger Mistry has been on the Tata board since 2005, taking over a seat vacated by his father. Described as an avid golfer and prolific reader of business books, Mistry has a civil engineering degree from London's Imperial College and studied management at the London Business School. Mistry is married to Rohiqua, daughter of high-profile lawyer Iqbal Chagla, who told Indian press that Mistry ""has a very old head on his young shoulders."" ""People raised eyebrows when Ratan Tata succeeded JRD (Tata, the previous chairman),"" Darius Pandole, a partner in New Silk Route, told India's Economic Times. ""Look at what he's achieved.""

"(CNN) -- The Violence Against Women Act has protected crime victims and helped police and prosecutors take violent criminals off our streets for nearly 20 years. After it became law in 1994, it was reauthorized, with robust support from both parties, in 2000 and 2005. Republicans played a prominent role in crafting the act, and particularly its protections for undocumented crime victims. But this time around, House Republicans are blocking its reauthorization and proposing a dramatic and dangerous rollback in its protection for immigrant victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and human trafficking. The House Reauthorization bill undermines two decades of relief for immigrant victims who suffer continuing abuse at the hands of U.S. citizens or permanent resident spouses or parents.Â  The Violence Against Women Act has provided undocumented immigrant women and children, who might depend on their abusers for legal status or economic support, a special immigration remedy that helps victims Â become independent and stops their assailants from trying to keep them quiet with threats of deportation. The House bill breaks with that history by weakening vital confidentiality provisions that protect immigrant spouse and child abuse victims from retaliation by keeping their abusers from interfering with the victims' immigration case. A U-visa, a feature of the act, gives a person who is undocumented and a victim of certain violent crimes protection from deportation with legal status and work authorization. It is not easy to get one. You must meet certain criteria and agree to assist and continue assisting in law enforcement investigations and prosecutions. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service reported that the Department of Homeland Security has incorporated safeguards for adjudicating these cases and there is no evidence of fraud. The House bill would put immigrant crime victims on a path ""from report to deport"" by making U-visas temporary and contingent on factors outside the victim's control, such as whether a rapist has been identified. It would also remove the possibility of lawful permanent resident status for those who, thanks to the U-visa, are able to summon the courage to report crimes and cooperate in criminal investigations and prosecutions. The U-visa has been instrumental in solving and preventing crimes. In one dramatic case, a police officer who investigated gangs helped an immigrant victim of domestic violence and sexual assault obtain U-visa certification from his department. This action ended up saving his life. The victim cooperated in the successful prosecution of her assailant. And she later warned the officer that her abuser's gang had put out a contract to kill him and his partner. The House bill's proposed changes would have ended in her deportation and, perhaps, those officers' deaths. Members of Congress who once led efforts to offer immigration relief for crime victims included nearly equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats. I had the privilege of assisting these bipartisan collaborations to create special immigration protections for victims of spousal, child and elder abuse, the U-visa for cooperating crime victims and the T-visa for human trafficking victims. The crimes suffered by U-visa applicants and recipients are predominantly domestic violence, child and elder abuse, at 46%; rape, human trafficking and sexual assault, at 29%; felonious assault, murder and torture, at 11%; and kidnapping and false imprisonment, at 8%. These are serious crimes indeed, and it is imperative that congressional leaders summon the political will to reauthorize the act before the end of December 2012. Each new incarnation of the act has improved protections. In contrast to the House bill, the Senate Reauthorization bill (S1925) continues the long bipartisan history of expanding the act to assure better protections for domestic violence and sexual assault survivors. The Senate bill extends protection to members of the LGBT community and Native Americans; prevents children from being denied benefits because they have grown too old during the long application process; expands the pool of U-visas and adds stalking to the list of covered crimes. It also strengthens protections for foreign fiances and spouses of U.S. citizens through amendments to the International Marriage Broker Regulation Act. The Senate bill addresses an annual shortfall by increasing the cap on U-visas from 10,000 to 15,000 for each of the next eight years. This is not a net gain in allotted U-visas, but is a recapture of about 34,000 of roughly 74,000 U-visas that were authorized by Congress but never used. From 2001 to 2007, thousands of applicants were granted interim relief, rather than the U-visas allotted for those years, while they waited for Department of Homeland Security to adjudicate their cases. The House bill keeps the cap at 10,000 and imposes restrictions that will make it impossible to investigate, solve and prosecute crimes when the victim is an immigrant. Every U-visa represents a tip to law enforcement and a cooperating witness. In a survey of nearly 8,000 U-visa cases, 99.45% of U-visa applicants and U-visa holders either provided, or were willing to provide, critical information and ongoing cooperation with police and prosecutors. Police departments are benefiting greatly from the value of the U-visa in building good relationships with immigrant communities. HR 4970 would end U-visa protections and thus discourage victims' cooperation with law enforcement, destabilizing the trust between police and immigrant communities the law has fostered for many years. Immigrant crime victims who receive U-visas have a legal obligation to continue cooperating with law enforcement as a requirement to file for lawful permanent residency. This allows police to maintain important sources of information. U.S. demographics are changing. Today 27% of the U.S. population is either immigrants or has one or more immigrant parent. Passing the Senate's proposals for the Violence Against Women Act will allow many victims of terrible crimes to come out of the shadows and find justice and safety. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Leslye Orloff.","Leslye Orloff: GOP, Democrats have supported Violence Against Women Act since 1994 .

"(CNN) -- Behold the power of the teeny, tiny camcorder. With the push of a button, we've got real-time recordings of clashes with riot police in Egypt, chaotic protest scenes in Libya, totally adorable kitties and rambling, real-life mumblecore scenes of everybody sipping Tecate and listening to that new YACHT album on Spencer's porch. That's right, documenting life on video is easier than ever, and rolling cameras are preserving moments that otherwise would have been lost. Recently, a young acquaintance passed away, and her friends scoured their hard drives, sending her parents iPhone and Flip cam clips of her goofing around or vacationing or just hanging with friends. Those vids captured moments snapshots never could -- movement, gestures, body language, voice. Would her clique have had so many clips to choose from 20 years ago, when personal video recording involved bulky cameras and tapes? Certainly not. Thank you, Digital Age. YouTube, the original platform for anyone with Internet service and a penchant for hitting the record button, recently hit 3 billion daily views, proof positive of our need to film and screen. ""Watching the Watchers,"" an awesome article in the current issue (that's print, not online) of Wired, notes the ubiquity of cameras. It said roving cameras have turned citizens -- the ones whom ol' Orwell worried would be constantly in Big Brother's view -- into watchdogs who capture and bring to light shadowy instances of police brutality, for example. But the writer, Clive Thompson, also admits that when he wore an ear-mounted camera for a day, he unnerved the crap out of everyone he encountered. So, two takeaways here: One, become that wannabe videographer who uses the video function on her phone/tablet/etc. because videos shared over social networks have power, either for nostalgic or citizen journalism purposes. And two, when filming your friends in particular, don't be a complete jerk about it. Here are a few things to keep in mind before pressing the big red record button. Be transparent . Raise your hand if this has ever happened to you: You're mugging in front of what you assume is a still camera for something like 30 seconds, wondering why the cameraman hasn't pressed the shutter, only to learn the device is on video and you've been captured posing like a fool and intermittently hissing ""Did you take it?"" through your teeth. Don't be sneaky. Announce you're taking a video, let everyone get their awkward hand waves out of the way, and then keep rolling as the gang relaxes and the action unfolds.

"(CNN) -- It's a phrase uniquely hated by high school teachers and internship coordinators everywhere: ""Could you write me a reference?"" But it means something different now than it did even a decade ago. Sure, trigonometry teachers still need to crank out those form letters packed with hoary cliches like, ""a pleasure to have in class,"" and ""interested in education in the truest sense of the word"" and ""correctly follows APA guidelines at least 80% of the time when turning in papers."" But now the rest of us are treating our networks like the people version of Yelp, giving (and soliciting) reviews all over the place. LinkedIn has long had a ""ask to be endorsed"" function (that's seriously what it says), where coworkers and bosses can gush about you right on your online resume. But the site's no longer the only space where you're begging for accolades. The person borrowing or lending you a car (see Getaround), a bike (see Spinlister), an apartment (see AirBnB) or even an electric drill (see ToolSpinner) wants to know that you are not, in fact, a psychopath. So in a weird way, your presence on these online bazaars, where social media meets the marketplace, has become part of your online persona. And wouldn't it suck if a potential employer Googled you and learned that you misrepresented the ""spacious"" parking lot in front of your lawn (see Parking Panda), which is actually ... your lawn? Ergo, we offer up some tips for giving (and getting) digital referrals that will show the world just what a wonderful human you are. 1. Don't just use the site's ""request a referral"" function. It's jarring to be going through your day and then suddenly get an email that basically says, ""A person in your life wants you to sign up for a site you've never heard of and write nice things about him/her."" Reach out to your target reference first, and ask if she'd mind doing you the favor. And don't feel too bad about the ask. Research shows that people enjoy the ego boost of doing something altruistic, so in a way, you're doing her a favor. 2. Write it for her. Not ENTIRELY, but give her some bullet points. See, stringing together words is kind of hard for a lot of people. (See: online comments sections. Zing!) And if your friend or former boss isn't entirely sure which of your virtuous qualities you want highlighted, she runs the risk of writing something off-topic and wasting both of your time. Outline what you're looking for her to say (e.g., ""It'd be awesome if you could just mention that I'm responsible and respectful and take good care of my stuff."" Assuming that is not a blatant lie.) Also give her a basic sense of how long it should be -- a sentence, a paragraph, a whole freaking recommendation letter? 3. Volunteer to return the favor. Ask if she'd like a recommendation on the same site or another one. Everyone could use a boost. 4. Put some stock into strangers' reviews... Zero reviews on a site that hinges on trust should give you pause. (One AirBnB user had her apartment ""burglarized and ransacked"" by a guest, prompting the company to add an insurance policy.) If you're going to lend someone your car or apartment (not just a jigsaw), try to Google him, get him on the phone and/or friend him (temporarily) on Facebook. 5. But not too much stock. It isn't hard to create a fake profile and make nice, allegedly third-person comments about yourself. So, depending on your personal level of paranoia, the above steps of added due diligence might be wise even for established users. 6. Be a good little reviewer bee. Whenever you deal directly with a person online (buying a used book on Half.com, etc.), take the 20 seconds afterward to rate the experience. If it was good, you're growing their business, and if it was bad, you're doing a good deed for the rest of humanity. We know, we know, you're too busy to rate experiences after-the-fact. That's why you're doing dealings online in the wee hours of the night while eating Bugles and wiping the crumbs on your shirt, right? Well, giving and getting reviews is a (sad, half, proxy for) actual human interaction. Take whatever you can get.","Presence in ""online bazaars"" such as car-lender Getaround is part of a digital persona .

"Dongshigu Village, China (CNN) -- The memories are still raw for 78-year-old Wang Jinxiang. In her own home, guards put her through the daily humiliation of body searches. This is where guards repeatedly beat her youngest son, prominent blind human rights advocate Chen Guangcheng, and his wife. Wang's eyes well with tears when she described how officials refused to let her say goodbye to a different dying son. For more than 18 months, Wang was largely confined to house arrest along with her son. Unlike Chen, she was still allowed to go out to buy groceries from time-to-time, accompanied by several guards. ""The guards moved in, eating here, sleeping there -- and two usually sat right outside Guangcheng's bedroom day and night,"" said Wang, pointing to different areas in her courtyard. Her chronic arthritis worsened during her son's captivity. The dozens of burly plainclothes guards who blocked all entrances to this small village, turning away -- often violently -- would-be visitors including CNN crews on three different occasions, are now gone. They have left the farmer's house tucked away in the rural Shandong province. All that remains are the clucking chickens roaming free in Wang's courtyard. The lone reminder of that period seems to be a surveillance camera watching over a footpath where Chen's arguably most famous supporter -- ""Batman"" star Christian Bale -- was roughed up and chased out last December. Her youngest son, the blind activist, is now thousands of miles away in New York. His arrival in the United States on May 19 -- along with his wife and children -- brought an end to a diplomatic firestorm between Beijing and Washington that erupted after he fled from house arrest in late April and hid inside the U.S. embassy in China's capital for a week. ""They spent millions of dollars to keep me away from public view, but I still end up talking to you today,"" Chen, who turned 41 on Monday , told CNN via Skype. ""They should realize the effect of suppression and persecution won't last."" In 2006, the self-taught legal activist was sentenced to four years and three months in prison for ""damaging property and organizing a mob to disturb traffic."" His supporters have maintained that the charges were trumped up by local officials -- the same group that Chen said was responsible for the grotesque abuses he and his family suffered after his release -- to punish his legal advocacy. Chen has fought for victims of what he called abusive practices of the country's draconian family planning policy, including forced abortions and sterilizations. Like him, a new breed of grassroots activists for a myriad of causes -- united by their goal for a freer and more just society -- is making its mark in China, posing a rising threat to the Communist government obsessed with control and stability. Hu Jia is an old friend of Chen and among the first people he met after fleeing to Beijing. A champion of democracy and political freedom, Hu, 39, was arrested and sentenced to three and a half years in prison on subversion charges before the Beijing Olympics in 2008. Now technically a free man, Hu says his continued effort in exposing corruption and injustice after release from prison has led to constant harassment from the authorities, including frequent house arrest in his apartment complex in eastern Beijing -- ironically named Freetown. ""They try to destroy your dignity, your freedom, everything except your life -- and I think the root of such tyranny actually reveals their own insecurity,"" Hu told CNN in a recent interview, before officials forced him to leave town to ensure a trouble-free 18th Communist Party National Congress where a once-in-a-decade leadership transition will take place at its conclusion. ""I've always told the authorities, we're playing the game of cat and mouse -- but I am the cat,"" he added. Inspired by the likes of Hu and Chen, analysts see a trend of more people in the younger generation -- armed with legal knowledge and Internet skills -- joining the ranks of human rights activists at a time when mass discontent over problems like a widening income gap and rampant official corruption simmer beneath the surface. Former English teacher He Peirong -- known by her online name Pearl -- was so touched by Chen's story that she became involved in the plan to rescue him from his village to Beijing. Police in her hometown of Nanjing detained her for a week after Chen's escape in April, but she says she feels no regrets. ""As we become more educated and better off, I think our political conscience will become stronger, as more people wake up to stand up for their rights,"" she said, adding that police had warned her not to go to Beijing during the Party Congress. As the West relies more on China economically during a global slump, observers say the issue of human rights has taken a backseat in its interaction with the Chinese leadership, noting that it was barely mentioned during the recent U.S. presidential election campaign. ""This is compensated greatly by the fact that Beijing is more worried than ever about the domestic human rights movement, about the fact that its citizenry is increasingly framing their demands through legal rights and human rights language,"" said Nicholas Bequelin, a Hong Kong-based senior Asia researcher for Human Rights Watch. ""The Party sees the stakes as getting higher and higher, and therefore we are seeing an increase in unlawful tactics and means of suppression of dissent."" Chen and his family say they have borne the brunt of such tactics, and relatives left behind continue to face official retribution after the activist's escape. His oldest brother, Chen Guangfu, hasn't seen his son for half a year. Authorities arrested the younger Chen for attempted murder in late April and told his family that no one except police officers was allowed to see him during the investigation. The Chens have maintained that the activist's nephew injured a few officials with a kitchen knife in self-defense when they broke into his house in the middle of the night and attacked his family after his uncle ran away. An official with the local police department, who declined to give his name, told CNN that the younger Chen's case is now ""in the judicial process"" and would not comment further. Repeated phone calls to the local prosecutor's office went unanswered. ""My family is ruined, but I don't regret helping Guangcheng -- and we have done nothing illegal,"" Chen Guangfu said. ""He helped those in need with his knowledge and skill -- and at least we can answer to our conscience."" With Vice President Xi Jinping expected to be appointed the new Communist Party chief Thursday, Pearl says she feels more optimistic about the country's future direction while Hu emphasizes he has lost all hope on the current regime. Chen, citing Chinese history, views the leadership change as almost irrelevant when it comes to the inevitable fall of tyranny and move toward a constitutional democracy. While activists seem divided on whether a new generation of leaders will improve China's human rights record, Chen Guangcheng's elderly mother says she has a more basic worry: Will her youngest son ever be allowed back home to live freely and safely?","Chen Guangcheng's mother lives with memories of guards in their home .

"(CNN) -- While most children Stella Ehrhart's age are thinking about what they're going to be for Halloween, this 8-year-old from Nebraska is thinking about who she's going to be each day of the week. But don't misinterpret what she's doing as ""dressing in costume,"" her mother said. Stella is dressing ""in character"" based on what she has in her closet and where her imagination takes her. All it takes is a black dress and a red-tissue paper flower in her hair and she's jazz singer Billie Holiday. Or, she's Jane Goodall with a flannel shirt and stuffed chimp tucked under her arm. With a khaki shirt emblazoned with a police badge she's her Aunt Pam, a police officer. ""She's definitely drawn to characters that have overcome a lot, with a lot of inner strength,"" her mother, Stephanie Anderson, said. Her ideas come from books, people she learns about or even friends and relatives, she said. The list goes on and on because she hasn't repeated a single costume since she started last year at the beginning of second grade, Stella and her mother say. Stella was reading Laura Ingalls Wilder's ""Little House"" series about a pioneer family's life and wondered what the author wore. The next day she showed up to school in a dress with leggings, Stella said, starting a tradition that lasted the entire school year. She resurrected it this year as she began third grade. It's important to not repeat characters, Stella said in a phone interview, because doing so would mean fewer opportunities to try something new. ""I think it's better to focus on as much as we can,"" she said. ""If I repeat an outfit five times that's five times we don't have for a new character."" Not all of the characters are obvious or distracting, which minimizes their potential to disturb the classroom, her mother said. To the contrary, teachers and students love it because they tend to learn something new about the person Stella is emulating. ""I think its just in her genes,"" said Anderson, who worked in local theater in Omaha before she had kids. Stella's father is the director of Omaha's Rose theater. ""She does this all on her own,"" Anderson said in a phone interview. ""I don't costume her or buy anything special for this, we shop at Target and Goodwill for clothes."" Stella shared insights into her five favorite costumes and what she has learned from them. -- Harriet Tubman: ""I like her because she led people on the Underground Railroad, she was a slave. ... I like how she helped 26 people and risked her life for them."" -- Helen Keller: ""I like how she never gave up on learning and she kept trying until she learned how to read Braille."" -- Rosa Parks: ""She said she had enough of it. She stayed on her seat on the bus. That was her way of saying, 'No way, this is not fair and I don't like it!' "" -- Anne Frank: ""People just think she's the person who hid behind the door but she had to move three times. ... You've got to do what you have to do."" Jane Adams (activist): ""It's good to do what you have to do to help people, especially those in need."" So, what is she going to do for Halloween? ""I'm not sure yet,"" Stella said. ""I haven't really thought about it yet as a special day, so probably whatever I had planned.""","Stella Ehrhart, 8, dresses as a different character each day for school in Omaha, Nebraska .

"(CNN) -- As human rights advocates around the world celebrate the 64th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights this week, their counterparts in the United States are mourning the Senate's rejection last week of the international convention for disability rights. Appalling in its own right, the Senate Republicans' defeat of the 21st century's first human rights treaty is a sad but sharp reminder that misinformation and fear can still override fundamental principles of human decency and common sense. More importantly, it is yet another blow to the United States' ability to play a leading role in promoting freedoms and human dignity in the world. The international bill of rights adopted by the United Nations on December 10, 1948, still stands as the gold standard in the daily fight for basic human rights today. As our societies democratize, mature and progress, human rights defenders are winning longstanding battles to expand the frontiers of rights to include women, children, indigenous peoples, LGBT communities and migrants. Economic and social rights are ascendant as well, as people make claims for the essentials of human life: water, food, health, jobs and education. The United States has a long and generally bipartisan tradition of concern for human rights, a pillar of its founding principles. Americans also have been at the forefront of the global human rights movement for generations and consider ourselves a leading example for others of a rights-respecting society, even if we still have much work to do to improve our record. Indeed, it was Congress' passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990 that paved the way for the international campaign for disability rights and which served as the standard for the treaty the Senate rejected. When it comes to international law, however, some Americans get confused. The image of the United Nations as a supranational body with powers to insert itself into our living rooms persists even though there is no evidence to support it. This myth-making, and its inherent contradictions, are in full display in Rick Santorum's bizarre opinion essay published last week in The Daily Beast. In it, the leader of the conservative movement, to defeat the treaty, claims that unelected U.N. bureaucrats could take away a parent's power to demand special education services for a disabled child. He then asserts that there is no point in ratifying the treaty because it ""would do nothing to force any foreign government to change their laws or to spend resources on the disabled. That is for those governments to decide."" Precisely. The hallmark of the U.N. human rights system is its success in elaborating international standards for protecting a comprehensive set of human rights, monitoring states' respect for those rights and making recommendations for improving their records. In exceptional cases involving gross violations, such as war crimes and mass atrocities, governments (though not the United States) have agreed to a more robust set of mechanisms, like the International Criminal Court, to hold individuals accountable. The emerging doctrine of responsibility to protect civilians has even been applied to prevent the slaughter of civilians in Libya. But these measures are a far cry from any alleged interference of U.N. lawyers in our schools and homes. At the end of the day, however, national sovereignty trumps these efforts, leaving any state free to follow its own path for governing its people. For better or worse, that's the way it works. There is a broader and more disheartening message that the world hears from Washington on this year's International Human Rights Day: The United States is losing its moral voice on human rights because it is not leading by example. As one human rights defender remarked to me recently, his government routinely cites U.S. treatment of detainees at Guantanamo as justification for its own violations of human rights. When the exceptional case, like the ""necessary"" measures adopted to wage battle against terrorists, becomes the norm, we have lost a major source of credibility to promote basic principles of due process and ""innocent until proven guilty."" Unfortunately, the conservative movement's victory in defeating the disability rights treaty is just the latest example of our political leaders' failure to convert high-sounding rhetoric into meaningful action when it comes to human rights. If a war hero Republican like Bob Dole, who uses a wheelchair, cannot persuade his colleagues to do the right thing, then we are all the losers in the battle for human rights. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ted Piccone.","Last week, Senate Republicans defeated the international convention for disability rights .
Misinformation and fear overrode decency and common sense, says Ted Piccone .

"(CNN) -- Derreck Kayongo's Global Soap Project collects used hotel soap bars, reprocessing it to save lives in impoverished countries. Since 2009, the Atlanta-based nonprofit has provided about 150,000 bars of soap for communities in 10 countries, including Haiti, Kenya and Afghanistan. Kayongo, a Uganda native, considers the soap he provides for poverty-stricken children ""a first line of defense"" to help fight disease. CNN asked him for his thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2011. CNN: Where were you when you got the call that you'd been selected as a top 10 CNN Hero? Derreck Kayongo: I was in my office at work, and I was really taken by surprise by this generous compliment. It's very humbling and at the same time very rewarding to know that there are folk out there who think that we are doing something so important to human survival that it warrants recognition of this magnitude. On behalf of all the poor that live on a dollar a day, we receive this recognition with immense joy. Someone does really care! CNN: What do you hope this recognition will mean to the Global Soap Project? Kayongo: This will symbolize a firm acknowledgment by the American public that a new culture of good stewardship -- as it relates to recycling soap to help fight disease -- is long overdue. From this day forth, gone is the day that one will travel and stay in a hotel and wonder what will happen to that bar of soap left behind. With this new recognition, (we hope) the Global Soap Project will be a formidable force in the fight against poor sanitation around the world. CNN: What do you want people to know most about your work? Kayongo: Before Global Soap Project, the hotel industry -- at no fault of their own -- threw away 8 million bars of soap every year. Because of our work, this world is going to be a better place than we found it -- with no soap being thrown away and with no child or woman in a refugee camp or orphan or any vulnerable populous left without a bar of soap to fend off disease.

"(CNN) -- For her long and impressive résumé of independent films like ""Dazed and Confused,"" ""Party Girl,"" and ""Best in Show,"" Parker Posey is often referred to as the ""Queen of the Indies."" Though much of her work in recent years has focused on memorable television roles, the Mississippi native returns to the big screen in Michael Walker's ""Price Check."" In the film, which debuts in select theaters on November 16 and is available for rental on iTunes. Posey plays ""Susan,"" a powerful marketing executive overseeing a chain of grocery stores. For fans who have grown to love Posey's trademark dry wit and pitch perfect edginess, Susan lands squarely in the wheelhouse. In her war to take over corporate America, Susan faces off with a man at every turn. Part genius, part sociopath, part seductress, Susan uses her full arsenal of God-given weapons -- from sexual manipulation to full blown tempter tantrums -- to get what she wants. During a recent conversation with CNN, Posey discussed her new role, explained her take on the public's misconceptions about working in Hollywood and confessed the whoops moment that just may have cost her Angelina Jolie's Oscar. CNN: My first impression of you is that you're fearless. Are you fearless? Parker Posey: You know, I don't really see myself that way. I've been doing this now professionally for 20 years. Isn't that wild? I think the perception is when you're famous you pick and choose your own material, but, honestly the material comes to me and I don't feel like I don't have much of a choice at all. So, when something is good, I end up doing it. But, I do like to show things that maybe most people wouldn't want to show of themselves, where people can judge you and you're not perfect. So, maybe that's where you're getting that kind of fearlessness. CNN: The character you play in ""Price Check"" certainly falls in this category. Posey: There are things about ""Susan"" that I think are very of this time right now. I've certainly seen women like this that are very entitled and powerful and manipulative and seductive. CNN: She's a woman dominating a man's world but with what most would consider typically masculine traits. Posey: Those characteristics excited me! I don't read parts like that that have those levels - someone who's powerful and also someone who's a loose canon. She has a really strong appetite, even more than these men that are around her and she's hungry for more! One of the first ideas or images I had for her was Faye Dunaway from ""Network."" Her female powers aren't female, they are totally male. And she doesn't have those things that make a woman powerful like vulnerability and sensitivity and intuition. She takes and she demands. CNN: She even demands fun. I love the Halloween party scene when she keeps saying everyone is going to have fun, but clearly has no idea what fun is. Posey:  I didn't even think about that. That's so true. She's all about planned fun. It's not like that in other countries. Doesn't that seem like a very American thing to do? CNN: I have heard that before, yes. We're a very type-A culture. But, you seem like a woman who knows how to have a good time. What brings you the most joy these days? Posey: It's a really laid-back thing like cooking or having friends over and just talking. I like a one-on-one with a friend, really deep conversations. CNN: Are you and your friends talking about the election at all? Posey: Well, it's all kind of unsettling what we're seeing right now being played out. This drama! That it becomes entertainment, that it becomes a game. I can't really watch it, I just get too, there's so much that needs to be done, I get kind of down about politics. I don't have the stomach to usually watch it. CNN: There's a lot of attention being paid to women's health. Posey: Yeah, yeah, I think we're in the '50s. I think we're at very conservative times as women, as individuals. It's strange times. CNN: I wonder what Susan's reaction would be to all the men talking about women's issues. Posey: I think she'd be really mad. Then, she would run for president. CNN: (laughter) Susan is just the latest of many roles you've made famous, but was there ever a part you passed on and then regretted later? Posey: What I did pass on that may surprise you is ""Girl Interrupted."" The Angelina Jolie role. And she won the Academy Award! Isn't that funny? CNN: Oh, I could definitely see you in that role. Why did you pass? Posey: I just didn't care enough about it. I don't know. There was something about it. They probably wanted me to audition and I didn't feel like doing it, or maybe they wanted me to jump through hoops and I didn't feel like doing it. Honestly, I just didn't care about it enough to be grounded in it.","""Queen of the Indies"" Parker Posey is tackling a new role .

"(CNN) -- Perfumes are typically named for flowers, jewels, seasons or feelings -- not long-range missiles. But residents of Gaza can now buy a fragrance inspired by the rockets used in Hamas' recent conflict with Israel. Gaza company Stay Stylish is behind the perfume, called M75. ""We have a marketing slogan which is 'Whoever loves victory, happiness and dignity, loves the M75 perfume,'"" the company's marketing director, who wished to be identified only as Shadi, told CNN at the Stay Stylish store in Gaza City's Rimal neighborhood. ""M75 in Gaza means a period of happiness, or the feeling of victory, and the use of the perfume is an expression of happiness as well."" The M75 was one of the long-range missiles militants in Gaza fired at Tel Aviv and Jerusalem during the conflict last month, which ended after eight days with a cease-fire on November 21. Although the conflict resulted in the deaths of many more Palestinians than Israelis, Hamas' leader Khaled Meshaal claimed victory for his organization, saying Hamas had forced Israel to accept their terms. Many Gazans took to the streets to celebrate what they saw as a victory over the Israeli military. Shadi told CNN the ""victory"" provided an ideal marketing opportunity. He said the rocket was a local symbol of pride, used in much the same way a Parisian company might use an image of the Eiffel Tower to market their perfume. ""In our case, it was the victory of the Palestinians that will make a profit for our company,"" he said. Charles Lister, an analyst at IHS Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Center, told CNN the M75 was named for one of Hamas' founders, Ibrahim Al-Maqadma, and its designed range of 75 kilometers. Although the rocket was essentially a reproduction of Iranian technology, Hamas had branded the rocket a Palestinian achievement to project an image of self-dependence and military strength. ""By claiming to have produced the M75 itself, Hamas is arguably trying to present itself as a force capable of producing its own weapons and not relying only on foreign powers as suppliers,"" he said. The commander of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards has publicly acknowledged supplying Hamas with the knowledge to develop the M75, a version of Iran's Fajr missiles. Shadi said the perfume came in male and female versions, with the male scent containing notes of citrus, vanilla and sandalwood, and the women's version smelling of rose, basil and jasmine. Both were selling well, he said. ""Thank God the Palestinian people are proud of the number 75."" M75 is not the first fragrance to have been inspired by a conflict with Israel. Following the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict, Lebanon's Daily Star reported bottles of a scent called ""Resistance"" were being sold in southern Beirut, packaged with an image of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and a representation of a damaged Israeli warship.","A Gaza company has launched a perfume named after Hamas' M75 rockets .

Rushing waters made seem to make beach houses disappear. The destruction was breathtaking . ""I am not going outside,"" said Mann. ""But when people do go outside the clean up is going to be tremendous and there is going to be a lot of damage."" Shahir Daud was watching the lights go out in his Upper East Side New York neighborhood, hoping that his place would not be next. He saw manhole covers blown out of the street and wondered if there was a fire nearby. He watched as dark waters from the East River submerged parts of Franklin D. Roosevelt East River Drive. But by late Monday evening it seemed that the worst of the storm had passed his neighborhood. And the 33 year-old filmmaker wondered when he would be able to get back to his job at MTV.

Millions were not that lucky and were still in the dark, officials said. Another danger was the more than 60 mph wind gusts that were predicted to batter a large number of northeastern states. CNN iReporter Earl Bateman, a stock broker, who has lived in New York for 30 years said he saw something he never saw before Monday. ""We just looked out the window and there's this river flowing through the middle of Manhattan,"" Bateman said. The power was still on in his building but the elevators had stopped working.

"Washington (CNN) -- Iran said it took ""decisive"" action after a U.S. drone entered Iranian airspace in the Persian Gulf last week, a commander said. ""Iran will use all its capabilities, including the relevant international agencies, to follow up on this case,"" Maj. Gen. Ahmad Vahidi said Friday, according to Iran's semi-official news agency ISNA. The Pentagon said two Iranian jets fired on an unmanned U.S. Air Force drone last week. But the United States said the firing happened over international waters on November 1. The Iranian action triggered a formal warning by the United States to Iran through diplomatic channels. Iranian jets fire on U.S. drone . The warning came after two Iranian Su-25 fighter jets fired on an unarmed Predator drone conducting routine surveillance in international airspace east of Kuwait, 16 miles off the coast of Iran, Pentagon press secretary George Little told reporters Thursday following CNN's report. Read more: U.S. targets Iranian human rights violators . The drone was not hit, and it returned under its own power to its base, he said. Little stopped short of calling the incident an act of war. ""I'm not going to get into legal labels. The reality is that we have a wide range of options, as I said before, to protect our assets and our forces in the region, and we'll do so when necessary,"" he said. ""The United States has communicated to the Iranians that we will continue to conduct surveillance flights over international waters, over the Arabian Gulf, consistent with longstanding practices and our commitment to the security of the region."" Little said the warning was delivered through Swiss diplomats who have acted on behalf of U.S. interests in Iran since Washington and Tehran cut ties in 1980. Read more: Unclear whether Iran shot down drone, a U.S. official says . ""Our aircraft was never in Iranian airspace. It was always flying in international airspace. The recognized limit is 12 nautical miles off the coast, and we never entered the 12-nautical mile limit,"" he said. The Obama administration did not disclose the incident before the presidential election. Three senior officials confirmed the details to CNN on Thursday. The three spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive intelligence nature of the matter. Two of the officials said the fighter jets belonged to Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps force, which has been more confrontational than regular Iranian military forces. At least two bursts of gunfire came from the Su-25s' cannons, they said. The drone started to move away, but the Iranian aircraft chased it, doing aerial loops around it before breaking away and returning to Iran. The drone's still and video cameras captured the incident, showing the two Su-25s approaching and firing their onboard guns, the officials said. The Iranian pilots continued to fire shots that went beneath the Predator but never hit it, according to the officials. U.S. military intelligence analysts are still not sure if the Iranian pilots simply were unable to hit the drone because of a lack of combat skill, or if they deliberately missed and didn't intend to bring it down. But as one of the officials said, ""It doesn't matter; they fired on us."" Little said the United States has to assume that Iran was trying to bring down the Predator. Before Vahidi confirmed the action, another Iranian commander, Maj. Gen. Seyed Masoud Jazaeri, commented on the reports of the incident. ""The armed forces will respond decisively to any act of transgression,"" he said, according to the semi-official Fars News Agency. ""If any foreign planes try to enter our country's space, our armed forces will confront it,"" he was quoted as saying. ""The defenders of the Islamic republic will give a decisive response to navy air, land or naval attacks."" CNN's Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- An American citizen has been detained in North Korea for more than a month, U.S. officials said Tuesday. The U.S. government does not believe that Kenneth Bae, who has traveled to North Korea several times before, is being mistreated, a U.S. official told CNN. Bae has been involved with a Protestant religious movement, the official said. The Swedish government, which acts as the protecting power for the U.S. in North Korea, is working to get consular access and trying to get him released, the official said. Bae's detention was first reported by South Korean newspapers, which said that Bae, a tour operator, entered North Korea at the port city of Rajin accompanied by five other tourists. Bae and the group were on a five-day trip to the country, according to South Korea's Yonhap News. One of the tour members was carrying a computer hard disk ""that apparently contained sensitive information,"" Yonhap News reported, citing a Korean-language paper. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland would only say that the United States was aware of the reports of Bae's detention, but because of privacy considerations, it would not discuss the issue further. ""We obviously have no higher priority than the welfare of our citizens. As you may know we have no representation in Pyongyang. The embassy of Sweden acts as our protecting power for issues involving U.S. citizens in North Korea,"" Nuland said Tuesday.","A tour operator has been held in North Korea for more than a month, U.S. officials say .

"(CNN) -- An Arizona charity may have come out ahead by turning down a gift from the nation's largest retailer -- a snub that grabbed headlines and renewed interest in the labor practices of big business. Casa Maria Free Kitchen, a Tucson-based food bank, rejected a $1,000 donation from Wal-Mart, joining a chorus of voices demanding better pay, fairer work schedules and affordable health care. The retailer had made $15,000 in donations to several charities as part of its typical outreach to community groups after opening a new store. But the Arizona charity said Tuesday that their snub netted much more than what Wal-Mart had offered after an outpouring of local donations came from those concerned about the store's effect on union jobs and small businesses. And yet, it may have all stemmed from a simple mistake. On October 26, Wal-Mart opened a new outlet in Tucson, boasting 300 new jobs and pledging thousands to charities identified by local political leaders. ""We had expected Casa Maria to be at the grand opening,"" said Delia Garcia, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman. But the food bank, which says it bags about 500 daily lunches for low- and no-income residents, never planned to attend. ""We had a big meeting about it and decided not to take the money,"" said charity organizer Brian Flagg. But Wal-Mart still included the group in its news release, which it later called a miscommunication. ""At that point, we had to do something,"" said Flagg, who wrote a letter entitled ""CORRECTION"" to the editorial board of his local newspaper. From there, the attention snowballed as news outlets reported on the defiant local charity that had rebuffed the retail giant. ""At the very least, it got us talking about the 'Walmartization' of America, and whether that's a good thing,"" said Flagg. And those concerned about the discount stores' effects have continued opening their checkbooks, he added. ""I don't have a set dollar amount that we've received, but I'm sure it was substantially more than Wal-Mart offered us,"" Flagg said. ""When people sent us checks, they also wrote 'thank for your stance on Wal-Mart.'"" The retailer responded Tuesday with a statement detailing its ""long history of supporting Tucson nonprofits."" ""Since 2009, Wal-Mart has donated more than $345,000 to local Tucson organizations that are supporting the community's needs,"" it said. ""Our pay and benefits typically meet or exceed what's offered by the majority of our competitors; we promote from within, our turnover rate is below the industry average and our associates' satisfaction scores have trended higher over the past few years."" The average wage of a full-time Wal-Mart employee in Arizona is $12.52 per hour, with the company reporting that it picks up about 75% of premium health care costs. But part-time employees who work fewer than an average of 30 hours per week do not qualify for those benefits. As a capital-versus-labor debate again flares up across the country, Flagg's rebuff drew a heady response. ""I have never given to Casa Maria before but when I read about them rejecting a donation from Wal-Mart I sent them a check,"" Tucson resident Kim Crooks posted on Facebook. ""I have never been in a Wal-Mart and never will. They have come into to many communities and put the small locally run businesses out of business."" But the move also sparked criticism about whether the group had shirked its main responsibility to feed the hungry. ""I think that these people are horrible,"" Jen Switalski posted on the site. ""As a charity they should take what they can get."" The local spate coincided with Black Friday demonstrations at Wal-Mart stores over pay, schedules and health care. Critics also say the stores' low prices squeeze out mom-and-pop competitors, depress wages and encourage foreign-based manufacturing while discouraging unionized labor. Supporters argue that Wal-Mart instead offers competitive wages and that its bargain prices foster consumer spending critical to a beleaguered economy. Wal-Mart and firms like it, they say, also give low-income households a chance to purchase otherwise unaffordable luxury products such as large-screen televisions and other electronics. So who's right? According to a 2008 study by West Virginia University economics professor Russell Sobel, Wal-Mart has had no real impact on the number of small businesses in the United States. And while mom-and-pop stores that are forced to compete with the retail giant are often put out of business, other businesses have taken their place, the study found. Others such as Robert Reich, a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and a former U.S. secretary of labor, argue that jobs filling those voids often offer low-wage, no-benefit occupations, limiting the purchasing power of America's middle class and poor.

"(Financial Times) -- The Philippines would strongly support a rearmed Japan shorn of its pacifist constitution as a counterweight to the growing military assertiveness of China, according to the Philippine -foreign minister. ""We would welcome that very much,"" Albert del Rosario told the Financial Times in an interview. ""We are looking for balancing factors in the region and Japan could be a significant balancing factor."" The unusual statement, which risks upsetting Beijing, reflects alarm in Manila at what it sees as Chinese provocation over the South China Sea, virtually all of which is claimed by Beijing. It also comes days before an election in Japan that could see the return as prime minister of Shinzo Abe, who is committed to revising Japan's pacifist constitution and to beefing up its military. A constitutional revision that upgraded Japan's Self-Defence Forces to a fully fledged military would allow it far more freedom to operate and could change the military balance in Asia. In spite of its official pacifism, Japan's armed forces do not lack for hardware. Its navy has about 50 large surface ships, compared with China's 70-odd. Support from other Asian nations for a rearmed Japan could embolden Mr Abe to change the constitution. Beijing has long raised the spectre of a return of Japanese militarism. The attitude towards Japanese rearmament in the Philippines, itself colonised by Japan, suggests regional fears of an assertive China may be beginning to trump memories of Japan's aggressive wartime actions. This month, the Philippines objected strongly to an announcement that maritime police from China's Hainan province would intercept ships entering what it considered its territorial waters. Beijing has started issuing passports that include a map of its ""nine-dash"" claim to almost the entire South China Sea, parts of which are also claimed by Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan and Indonesia. The Philippines has refused to stamp the new passports in protest. ""The Philippines has contended all along that the nine-dash claim is an excessive claim that violates international law,"" Mr del Rosario said. Southeast Asian countries concerned about what they see as an abrupt change in China's ""peaceful-rise"" diplomacy have welcomed the renewed commitment to the region by the US in the form of its ""pivot"". Mr del Rosario said Manila had agreed to more US ship visits and more joint training exercises. The region is also closely watching Beijing's stand-off with Tokyo over the Japanese-controlled Senkaku islands, known as the Diaoyu in China. Regional countries have struggled to present a united front against China, which prefers to deal with each capital bilaterally. Last June, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations failed to issue a final communiquÃ© after Cambodia refused to endorse language referring to recent naval stand-offs with China. In July, Japan and the Philippines signed a five-year agreement to strengthen military co-operation though exchanges of personnel and technology. Japan is providing 12 new patrol ships for the Philippine coast guard, financed with a combination of soft loans and foreign aid grants. © The Financial Times Limited 2012 .","The Philippines support a rearmed Japan to counterweight China's military power .

"(CNN) -- He became the first man in Olympic history to defend both his 100 meter and 200 meter crowns and Usain Bolt's gold-plated 2012 could be about to get a little better. The fastest man on the planet was untouchable during the Games in London, completing his unprecedented sprint double and also picking up gold with Jamaica's 4x100m men's relay team. It is no surprise then that Bolt leads the nominations for the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) male athelete of the year award. Bolt is joined on the list by two other male stars that enjoyed a successful summer in the English capital. Olympic hero Bolt to play for Manchester United? The second athlete chosen is American Aries Merritt, who took the men's 110m hurdles crown in London, before breaking the world record at a meet in Belgium shortly after. Merritt took seven hundredths of a second off the previous mark, held by Dayron Robles, which had stood for four years. The 27-year-old also took gold over the 60m distance at the World Indoor Championships held in the Turkish city of Istanbul in March. The third nominee is David Rushida, who holds one landmark Bolt will never gets his hands on after the Kenyan became the first man to break a world record on the track in London's Olympic Stadium. The 23-year-old was the first person to run under one minute and 41 seconds in the 800m as he broke his own world record storming to gold. His performances drew praise for the chairman of the London Organizing Committee, Sebastian Coe, who called Rushida ""the most impressive track and field athlete at these Games."" But there is no place for Britain's Mo Farah, who joined an elite list of distance runners by taking Olympic gold in both the 5,000m and 10,000m. Bolt will be favorite to take the award after dominating the sprint category in London just as he did in Beijing four years previously. The 26-year-old held off the challenge of compatriot Yohan Blake to secure his 100m and 200m double, labeling himself the ""greatest athlete"" to have lived after his triumph. Bolt's holds the world record in both disciplines and holds six Olympic gold medals, after also winning the men's 4x100m relay in 2008. The winner will be crowned on 24 November during the IAAF's Centenary Celebrations in the Spanish city of Barcelona.","Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt leads nominations for IAAF male athlete of 2012 .

"(CNN) -- Americans are forgoing medical attention in the face of high health-care costs, a new consumer health survey has found. The high cost of medical care and treatment has some sick people opting out of treatment, a survey finds. Specifically, 24 percent of people polled in the 2009 Deloitte Survey of Health Care Consumers decided not to seek medical care when they were sick or injured. The largest subgroups were those who were uninsured (36 percent), and those between ages 28 and 44, referred to as ""Gen Y"" respondents in the survey (37 percent). Two-fifths of the people who didn't see a doctor when they needed one did so because of the high cost of care. They either didn't have medical insurance coverage or they perceived the cost of such care to be excessive, according to the survey, which was released early Tuesday to CNN by the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions, a nonpartisan, independent research center. ""Costs are impacting the system, and it's changing how we respond to our health care,"" said Paul Keckley, executive director of the center. In addition to data about how many Americans fail to seek necessary medical care because of high costs, another theme that emerged in the survey focused on consumers' dissatisfaction with the nation's health-care system: . • 94 percent of respondents said they believe health-care costs threaten their own financial security. • More than half said they think 50 percent or more of the money spent by Americans on health care is a waste. • Only 6 percent indicated their own family is totally prepared to shoulder the financial burden they expect to face. Not only are Americans putting off health care and facing increasing dissatisfaction, they are also shopping around for better deals on doctors' fees, prescription medication prices or health insurance plans to cut costs, according to the survey. There has been a lot of perceived loyalty and commitment in health care, Keckley said, and many providers think patients will stay with them. ""This study suggests that people really don't [stay],"" Keckley added. ""And that's surprising."" Despite the desire to shop around and gather more information to make improved decisions about their health-care choices, the abundance of options also can be baffling, says Kathleen Stoll, deputy director of Families USA. The group is a nonprofit, nonpartisan health care advocacy organization that regularly advises consumers on choosing insurance coverage plans. ""People weigh the costs of deductibles versus premiums, and these options can be confusing. They are asking themselves, 'What is it that I can afford in the family budget?' I sense a lot of people feeling unnerved by having to choose less [insurance] coverage because that's all they can afford,"" Stoll told CNN. The survey also underscored Americans' receptiveness to innovations that potentially lower costs and offer greater convenience, pointing toward growing preferences for options such as retail walk-in primary care clinics in drug stores, medical tourism (high-quality, relatively inexpensive medical procedures obtained abroad) and Web-based medical services (often referred to as e-visits). Sampling a nationally representative group of more than 4,000 adults using a Web-based questionnaire, the survey was funded by the center's parent company, Deloitte LLP, which has a wide range of clients in the health care industry. The center released its first version of the annual survey results in 2008. Last month, the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation released its own health-care survey findings, with even greater numbers reflecting cutbacks in spending on medical services and treatments. According to the report, more than half of American households scaled back health-care spending in the previous 12 months before the survey, which was conducted in early February. Families relied on home remedies and over-the-counter medications instead of going to the doctor about 35 percent of the time, and they skipped visits to the dentist 34 percent of the time.","Survey finds 24% of respondents skip medical care when they're sick or injured .

"(CNN) -- Florida A&M University, under fire in the hazing death of a drum major and over its finances, was put on probation for one year by an accrediting agency, officials said Tuesday. FAMU expects more details of the sanction within the next week, the Tallahassee institution said in a statement. Administrators learned from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges that FAMU's accreditation is in jeopardy. The loss of accreditation would put thousands of students at risk of not being eligible for federal financial aid. The regional accrediting agency has expressed concerns about academic policies, student rights, the control of finances and the institutional environment, according to FAMU. It asked the university to provide information about policies that protect students when they participate in university-sanctioned events. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement separately investigated alleged ""financial irregularities"" involving the marching band. ""It is important to emphasize that FAMU remains an accredited institution, even while under the probation sanction from SACSCOC,"" interim university President Larry Robinson in a statement. ""We are committed to addressing the areas of concern, and ensuring that FAMU is compliant with all SACSCOC accreditation standards."" The probation comes as a Florida circuit court judge weighs whether to dismiss a civil lawsuit brought by the family of drum major Robert Champion Jr., 26. Champion died in November 2011 after being beaten on a bus in Orlando, Florida, after a football game at which the school's famed marching band performed. The hazing was part of a ritual known as crossing the bus, in which pledges attempt to run down the center aisle from the front door of the bus to the back while being punched, kicked and assaulted by senior members, band members have said. In September, FAMU responded to the lawsuit by filing court documents saying that the institution was not responsible for Champion's death. The school asserted that Champion broke the law and school policies when he willingly took part in the hazing that killed him. ""My reaction is that the school did not take the responsibility to keep my son safe,"" Robert Champion Sr. said.","Florida A&M University put on probation for one year by accrediting agency .

"(CNN) -- Al Ahly's incredible journey continued on Sunday as the Egyptian soccer side reached the semifinals of the Club World Cup in Japan. While back home protesters demonstrated against President Mohamed Morsy's planned constitutional referendum, Al Ahly set up a clash with South American champions Corinthians on Thursday. ""Ahly fans can now dream of reaching the final. We, too, dream of this, and we'll do our best to clinch the title,"" coach Hossam El-Badry told the club's television channel after a 2-1 victory over J-League winners Sanfrecce Hiroshima. With the Egyptian league suspended since the deaths of more than 70 fans at Ahly's match in Port Said in February, it is a miracle the Cairo team has got this far. Ahly qualified for the tournament by winning the African title for a record-extending seventh time last month, when the second leg in Tunisia was played the same day that more than 50 children died in a train accident in Egypt. Most of its home games in the African Champions League were played behind closed doors due to security fears, while the first leg of the final was held at a military facility near Alexandria. ""#Ahly is the only entity that can unite millions behind it on one opinion, hope, and dream,"" one fan wrote on Twitter after Sunday's game in Toyota. Veteran Mohamed Aboutrika scored a second-half winner in a match marred by a serious injury to the man he replaced -- Ahly's captain and key playmaker Hossam Ghaly. Battling snowy, cold conditions Ahly took the lead after 15 minutes when Hiroshima's replacement goalkeeper Takuya Masuda was given no chance by Elsayed Hamdi. Masuda had been forced into the fray in just the fifth minute when regular No. 1 Shusaku Nishikawa was carried off with a facial injury after colliding with Ahly striker Gedo. The home side equalized after Ahly captain Ghaly went off with a suspected ruptured knee ligament, as the J-League's leading scorer Hisato Sato netted in the 32nd minute. Aboutrika, playing at the tournament for the fourth time, scored his fourth goal to go level with record-holders Lionel Messi of Argentina and former Brazil international Denilson. Ahly also reached the semifinals in 2006, losing to Brazilian side Internacional before winning the third-place playoff against Mexico's Club America. ""The Corinthians are a great team. We'll do our best to get a positive result and dedicate the title to the victims of the Port Said stadium disaster,"" said the 34-year-old Aboutrika, who was also in the 2006 team. ""Playing with Brazilian opponents is always interesting for me. Also, Brazil is a great thing for me, especially since I dream of reaching the World Cup there with the national team."" Mexican team Monterrey also qualified for the semifinals, setting up a clash with European champions Chelsea on Thursday by beating Asian titleholders Ulsan Hyundai 3-1. Monterrey, winners of the CONCACAF Champions League last season, took the lead in the ninth minute through 19-year-old winger Jesus Corona while former Argentina international Cesar Delgado added two late goals. The Korean side scored an 88th-minute consolation through 2012 Asian player of the year Lee Keunho, whose long-range shot eluded keeper Jonathan Orozco.","Al Ahly and Monterrey qualify for semifinals of Club World Cup in Japan .

"(CNN) -- Rescue workers are searching for more than 300 Filipino fishermen who have gone missing after a devastating typhoon that tore across the Philippines last week, killing more than 600 people, authorities said Monday. Typhoon Bopha, the strongest tropical cyclone to hit the Philippines this year, set off flash floods and landslides that engulfed people sheltering in their rickety houses in remote, unprepared regions on the southern island of Mindanao. Read more: Rescuers struggle to aid Philippines storm victims . The number of people still unaccounted for climbed sharply during the weekend as officials learned of the disappearance of boatloads of fishermen who set off before Typhoon Bopha slammed into the east coast of Mindanao on Tuesday. Rescue efforts are under way to try to find the missing fishermen, many of whom left from the port city of General Santos on the south coast of Mindanao, said Maj. Reynaldo Balido, military assistant for operations at the Philippine Office of Civil Defense. A total 780 people are missing in the Philippines as a whole, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, the country's emergency management agency, said Monday. Read more: Devastation in a Philippine valley where typhoons aren't expected . That includes the fishermen and more than 400 people in New Bataan, a town in southeastern Mindanao where flash floods triggered by Bopha's heavy rain buried large areas under mud, rocks and trees. The overwhelming majority of the 647 people killed by the typhoon are from the regions of Davao Oriental and Compostela Valley, where New Bataan is situated. Many people in those areas failed to anticipate Bopha, known locally as Pablo, the strongest storm to hit Mindanao in decades. The island experiences fewer tropical cyclones than the regions of the Philippines further north. Survivors are now struggling to find enough water, food and shelter. Relief agencies are scrambling to provide help to the worst hit areas, but damage to infrastructure like roads and communications networks is complicating their task. The scale of the challenge facing them is huge: nearly 1,500 people have been injured and more than 300,000 have been forced to seek shelter in evacuation centers or elsewhere. Philippine President Benigno Aquino III, who visited New Bataan and other severely affected areas Friday, has declared a state of national calamity, which releases emergency funds and puts price controls on basic goods.","Typhoon Bopha has so far killed 647 people in the Philippines .

"(EW.com) -- Broadway is about to get a little extra sparkle in those famous neon lights. It was recently announced the ""Twilight"" musical is officially happening. Before you book your tickets to NYC (or, conversely, get the heck out of Times Square) you should know it's not expected to have a very long run. ""Twilight: The Musical"" will make its off-Broadway debut as a one-night-only staged reading on January 16, and the proceeds will benefit the charity Blessings in a Backpack. The most exciting thing about this announcement may be the cast, and the plot teases their characters' names give us. In addition to Bella and Edward, (who already sings a lullabyâ€”why shouldn't he also belt out a Broadway tune?) the name that gets me onboard is the totally awesome Lauren Lopez (Alice), who played Draco Malfoy opposite Darren Criss' Harry Potter in the spectacular ""A Very Potter Musical."" Other teases that make me cautiously optimistic this could be a lot of fun: characters named both Harry Potter and Hermione Granger will be showing up--perhaps leading up to that epic vampire vs. wizard war that we all know is coming. According to the website the show, ""examines our culture of obsession through the story of teenage outsider Bella Swan who risks everything when she embarks on a star-crossed romance with Vampire Edward Cullen."" The musical, which you can watch blurry clips of on YouTube, originally premiered and was workshopped last year in New York. With opening lyrics like ""Nothing ever happens in Forks"" and (of course) ""I wish I had a boyfriend,"" the show seems to be in the same vein as ""A Very Potter Musical"" in that it's a fun-loving parody by people who clearly enjoyed the source material. It will be interesting to see how far the production is able to get, as the show has no stated affiliation with Stephenie Meyer or Summit. Parodies are typically ok, copyright law-wise, but a show has to play up the 'unofficial' and 'spoof' aspects--the fact that the character names don't appear to be changed surprises me. That this one-night-only reading is for charity (aka no one involved is making money) probably helps. EW reached out to Dreamcatcher Entertainment (one of the producers) and they did not return requests for comment. Love it, hate it, or some strange combination of both, I'm surprised a ""Twilight"" show hasn't happened sooner. Think of the musical possibilities for a show with the tagline 'death never sounded so good.' (Please resist the obvious joke in the comments). A teenage girl is in love with a guy vampire from the wrong side of the tracks living. Are vampires and werewolves really that different from Sharks and Jets? And try to tell me the werewolf chases in the woods aren't just waiting to be a shirtless staged ballet. If you were in New York would you check it out?

"(CNN) -- Arsenal's stumbling season suffered a new low on Tuesday as the Gunners failed to reach the League Cup semifinals after being knocked out on penalties by fourth tier side Bradford City. Having made their worst Premier League start since Arsene Wenger took charge in 1996, Arsenal needed a late equalizer to force extra-time -- only to lose a dramatic penalty shoot-out as Bradford reached the last four for the first time in their 109-year history. Wenger has often fielded weakened sides for League Cup matches but he sent out a strong team at Bradford where the game ended 1-1 after 90 minutes, with extra-time failing to provide further goals. As they set about creating one of the biggest upsets in the competition's long history, Bradford opened the scoring through Garry Thompson after 16 minutes. Despite the presence of Santi Cazorla, Jack Wilshere and Lukas Podolski, the Gunners failed to register a shot on target until the final quarter of a match against a team from the bottom tier of the English football league. Arsenal captain Thomas Vermaelen thought he had rescued his side when heading home after 88 minutes, but the Belgian later turned from hero to villain as he missed the decisive kick in the penalty shoot-out to spark wild scenes of celebrations. ""Whenever you go out, it's not a good result for Arsenal,"" said Wenger. ""We lost on penalties to a team who defended well. I cannot fault the effort of my team, we gave absolutely everything for the 120 minutes and you have to give credit to Bradford."" The win meant that Bradford, whose stadium was hosting its largest crowd since 1960, had set a British record of nine consecutive penalty shoot-out wins. While the financially challenged club -- who were playing in the Premier League eleven years ago -- will celebrate the vital income that comes from reaching the competition's semifinals, Wenger can expect ever greater scrutiny in a season that goes from bad to worse. Many Arsenal fans were incensed when captain Robin van Persie was sold in August to traditional rivals Manchester United, with the league leaders now 15 points ahead of a team lying seventh in the Premier League after 16 rounds. Wenger, who won three league titles between 1998-2004, angered some supporters earlier this year when stating his belief that it was more important for Arsenal to qualify for the lucrative Champions League than to win trophies. Without a trophy since the FA Cup win in 2005, some Arsenal followers have lost patience as the gap between the club and rivals Manchester United and Manchester City grows -- with one group of fans recently protesting before the home defeat by Swansea City at the manner in which the club is being run. In the evening's other League Cup quarterfinal, Aston Villa coach Paul Lambert enjoyed a return to Norwich City, the club he left in June, as the visitors came from behind to win 4-1. Bradford and Aston Villa will be joined in the semis by Swansea City or Middlesbrough, who play on Wednesday, while the last quarterfinal will be known on 19 December when Leeds United host Chelsea, who are currently in Japan on Fifa Club World Cup duty. In the Premier League itself, Sunderland eased the pressure on coach Martin O'Neill when beating Reading 3-0 at home to climb out of the relegation zone and up to 15th in the table. In France, Sweden's Zlatan Ibrahimovic bagged a hat-trick as Paris Saint-Germain's 4-0 win at fifth-placed Valenciennes perfectly set up Carlo Ancelotti's side for Sunday's hosting of league leaders Lyon. The former Barcelona and AC Milan star needed less than an hour to register a treble, and take his tally to an unsurpassed 17 Ligue 1 goals, before Ezequiel Lavezzi also struck as Valenciennes suffered their first home defeat of the season. The win takes PSG to within two points of Lyon, who can extend their lead before the weekend's top-of-the-table clash at the Parc des Princes when hosting bottom side Nancy on Wednesday. PSG coach Carlo Ancelotti was under pressure one week ago, with his side having surrendered top spot in the league, but three consecutive wins have given the Italian some breathing space. After beating Portuguese title-holders Porto 2-1 to win their Champions League group, the big-spending French side have since thrashed both Evian and Valenciennes 4-0. Elsewhere, AS Roma beat Atalanta 3-0 to reach the quarterfinals of the Coppa Italia.","Fourth tier Bradford City stun Arsenal as they reach League Cup semifinals on penalties .

"(CNN) -- Javier Hernandez has had to be patient this season. Robin van Persie's arrival at Manchester United was followed by a glut of goals that justified Alex Ferguson's $38 million investment in the former Arsenal striker. Hernandez also made a big impact two years ago as a relatively little-known signing from Guadalajara, being named player of the season as United won a record 19th league title. But last season was a different story as the Mexico international played a bit-part role and the club's Premier League crown was snatched by crosstown rivals Manchester City. The 24-year-old came into the 2012-13 campaign fresh after Ferguson demanded he miss Mexico's successful Olympic campaign, but he has started only five matches out of 16 in all competitions. However, a run of seven goals in his last five games means ""Chicharito"" will be one of the first names on the team sheet next weekend for United's trip to Norwich. ""When he came to us two years ago, that's what we're seeing again today and, when you score a hat-trick, you pick yourself. I think he'll be playing next week,"" Ferguson said after Hernandez inspired another comeback victory against Aston Villa on Saturday to put United four points clear at the top of the table. The ""Little Pea"" scored three goals in the two come-from-behind wins against Braga that sealed United's place in the last 16 of the Champions League, and he came off the bench to rescue the team from 2-0 down against struggling Villa. It was the eighth time United have won this season after going behind. Hernandez is claiming a hat-trick, though his equalizing goal appeared to be off-target before it deflected into the net off Villa defender Ron Vlaar. Ferguson had to change his preferred attacking formation at halftime, taking off England winger Ashley Young, after Villa took a shock lead with two goals from young Austrian forward Andreas Weimann. ""We do prefer that one striker with one playing behind,"" the 70-year-old manager said. ""It didn't work today in the first half but when Javier came on and Robin dropped a bit deeper, and Wayne went out to the left-hand side, you had a feeling that if we got a goal we would go on and win it."" Van Persie could not add to his league-leading eight goals this season, but he played a key role as he hit the bar twice in the space of a minute and then laid on a perfect freekick for Hernandez to head an 87th-minute winner. ""It doesn't matter who scored the goals,"" Hernandez said. ""The most important thing is who is top of the league and that we came back from two goals down to win."" It put pressure on second-placed Chelsea and City, who respectively host Liverpool and sixth-placed Tottenham on Sunday. Seventh-placed Arsenal lost more ground on the leaders after being held 3-3 by London rivals Fulham, as midfielder Mikel Arteta missed a last-minute penalty. Arsene Wenger's team blew a two-goal lead for the second time this week, having also been held in the Champions League by Schalke. France striker Olivier Giroud put Arsenal ahead before fellow preseason signing Lukas Podolski added another, but Fulham's former Manchester United striker Dimitar Berbatov continued his career revival as he reduced the deficit and then set up Alex Kacaniklic's 40th-minute equalizer. The Bulgarian put visiting Fulham 3-2 ahead with a penalty but Giroud leveled before Arteta's spot-kick was saved by veteran Australian goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer -- leaving both teams on 16 points from 11 matches. ""It was frustrating because we had the chances,"" Wenger said. ""We were caught in too comfortable a position. We did the difficult thing, going 2-0 up, but then we lacked defensive urgency."" Everton stayed fourth with a 2-1 victory at Sunderland in manager David Moyes' 400th Premier League game. In-form Marouane Fellaini leveled Adam Johnson's opener with his sixth league goal this season and then set up striker Nikica Jelavic for the Croatian's fifth. Fifth-placed West Brom joined the Merseyside club on 20 points following a 2-1 win at Wigan. James Morrison headed the opener and Gary Caldwell diverting Billy Jones effort into his own net before Arouna Kone reduced the deficit just before halftime. Stoke moved away from the relegation zone with a 1-0 win at home to bottom club Queens Park Rangers, while promoted sides Reading and Southampton remained in the drop zone after respective draws against Norwich and Swansea.","Javier Hernandez comes off the bench to inspire Manchester United to victory .

"(CNN) -- Delta Air Lines has pre-emptively canceled approximately 500 Christmas Day flights, a company spokesman said Friday, as it and other U.S. airlines work to get ahead of a storm that's threatening the East Coast. Morgan Durrant, a Delta spokesman, said Friday that the airline has canceled roughly 300 flights in and out of Atlanta and 200 more elsewhere around the country. Delta also has joined Continental, United, American and AirTran in waiving penalties for travelers who have to reschedule their trips over the weekend. The mid-Atlantic and Northeast could see combinations of rain, sleet and snow, with the heaviest amounts of precipitation in highest elevations, CNN meteorologists said. Still, forecasters on Friday noted considerable uncertainty as to the shape, the direction and the strength of the system. By Friday evening, National Weather Service forecasters were predicting that an intensifying low-pressure system should hit Saturday night off the Carolinas coast and barrel northward toward Cape Cod, Massachusetts. In parts of West Virginia, light snow starting Friday night was expected  to give way to a ""prolonged snow shower event"" on Saturday night into  Monday, the weather service said. Two to five inches could fall every 12-hour period in  mountainous areas. A hazardous weather outlook was issued from Massachusetts south down the East Coast through New York, New Jersey, Delaware and into Maryland. The New York metropolitan area has a 40 percent chance of precipitation, which was expected to start after noon and fall as snow. While the accumulation there was expected to be fairly minimal, the weather service noted that a shift in the storm's track could mean ""significant wind-driven snowfall to the entire region."" In addition, winds could gust as strong as 50 mph for eastern Connecticut and New York's Long Island. Beginning Sunday afternoon and through Monday, southern New England  could see six to eight inches of snow -- with 10 inches possibly falling in  some locales. In addition, the National Weather Service cautioned about a  coastal flood threat for eastern Massachusetts during high tides. While the storm's path remained uncertain, airlines worked to get ahead of it by cancelling flights and adjusting restrictions and fees for those who changed their travel schedules. United Continental Holdings Inc., parent company of United and Continental airlines, said that ""customers scheduled on flights to, from or through the impacted areas may reschedule their itinerary with a one-time date or time change, and the change fees will be waived."" For canceled flights, ""a refund in the original form of payment may be requested,"" it said. Mike Trevino, a United Airlines representative, confirmed that United will issue a waiver for customers traveling Saturday through Monday to areas affected by weather. ""Customers will not be charged a change of ticket fee. No flights have been canceled in advance of the storm,"" he said. The offer applies to travelers with tickets purchased on or before Thursday and going to, from or through airports serving Newark, New Jersey; New York City, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Boston, Washington, Baltimore and Atlanta. Delta is offering customers whose flight plans may be affected by winter weather across the Southeast and East ""the ability to make one-time changes to their travels schedules without fees. Delta's weather advisory encourages customers to consider postponing or rerouting their travel to avoid possible inconvenience from expected flight delays."" Customers ""booked on Delta-ticketed flights to, from or through"" several cities ""may immediately rebook for travel before or after their original travel dates as long as new flights are ticketed and rescheduled travel begins by Dec. 29."" The cities are Atlanta, for travel booked for Saturday and Sunday; and Baltimore, Boston, Newark, New York and Washington for travel booked for Sunday and Monday. AirTran is also waiving penalties for passengers traveling to and from Atlanta from 2 p.m. Saturday to noon Sunday, and on Sunday and Monday for some cities ""as long as travel is completed within three days from the date of the original scheduled departure date or five days after the original scheduled departure date, based on space availability, without fees or fare adjustments."" The locations are Allentown, Pennsylvania; Atlantic City, New Jersey; Baltimore; Boston; Buffalo, New York; Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; New York City; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Portland, Maine; Richmond, Virginia; Rochester, New York; Washington; and White Plains, New York. American Airlines, too, will allow its customers set to fly December 26 and 27 in and out of certain destinations to change their tickets free of charge. The policy applies to airports in Boston, Washington, New York, Newark and Philadelphia.","NEW: Much of the East Coast, especially north of Washington, could see snowfall this weekend .

"(CNN) -- The fight boxing fans have long been clamoring for has moved a step closer, with undefeated Floyd Mayweather challenging Manny Pacquiao to a showdown on May 5 -- but will it happen? Hopes of the much-anticipated bout dimmed in December when Mayweather, the WBC welterweight champion, was sentenced to a 90-day prison term after being found guilty of domestic violence. However, a Nevada judge ruled last week that the American, who has won all 42 of his professional fights (26 by knockout), could delay reporting to jail until June because he had already lined up a fight in May. And now the 34-year-old has revealed he wants his opponent to be the Philippines' WBO champion -- his longtime rival for the title of best pound-for-pound boxer, and a man he failed to agree a deal with in 2010 after insisting on Olympic-style pre-bout blood testing. Mayweather chose micro-blogging website Twitter to issue his challenge. ""Manny Pacquiao I'm calling you out let's fight May 5th and give the world what they want to see,"" he wrote on Tuesday. ""My jail sentence was pushed back because the date was locked in. Step up punk."" However, Pacquiao -- who retained his WBO title in his third meeting with Juan Manuel Marquez in November -- issued a statement via his website saying he does not want to fight on that date. ""Manny Pacquiao wants to make it clear the fight can happen at the end of May -- Manny wants Floyd to release his grip on May 5th, so the fight can happen for the fans,"" Wednesday's statement read. Pacquiao has an impressive record, with 54 wins from 59 bouts -- 38 by knockout -- plus three losses and two draws. He is the first man in the sport's history to have won world titles in eight weight divisions. The 33-year-old is rated by Ring Magazine as the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world, with Mayweather second on the 10-man list following September's knockout win over compatriot Victor Ortiz in Las Vegas. Pacquiao has also launched a successful political career and was elected into the Philippine House of Representatives in June 2010.","Floyd Mayweather has challenged Manny Pacquiao to a fight on May 5 .

"(CNN) -- I have a dog named Norma. She is a small beige cockapoo who barks at the mailman. I would not trust Bobby Petrino to watch her. I also would not trust Bobby Petrino to take my car in for a tire change. I would not trust Bobby Petrino to deposit my Aunt Ruth's Social Security check. I wouldn't trust him to clean my bowling ball, shop for a Christmas ham, change a twenty for two tens, tell me the time or recite the proper lyrics to Blind Melon's ""No Rain."" This is not because I am a particularly untrusting person. No, it's because I think Bobby Petrino is slime. In case you missed the news, two days ago Western Kentucky University held a press conference to announce that Petrino, undeniably one of the nation's elite football minds, had agreed to a four-year, $850,000 per year deal to take over the Hilltoppers. With nearly 400 giddy sports fanatics in attendance, Petrino, standing alongside Todd Stewart, the school's athletic director, spoke of honor and loyalty and love and redemption. The ensuing press release, issued by Western Kentucky's sports information department, was straight out of Disney: 101. It made Petrino sound like a cross between Vince Lombardi, Martin Luther King and Gandhi; God's gift to young men seeking to better themselves. Petrino fired as Arkansas head football coach . What it failed to mention—and what the school desperately wants everyone to fail to mention—is that Petrino may well be the least ethically whole man in the, ahem, ethically whole-deprived world of Division I collegiate sports. Why, it was only seven months ago that Petrino, at the time the University of Arkansas' head coach, was riding his motorcycle when he crashed along Highway 16 near Crosses, Arkansas. When asked by school officials to explain what had happened, he failed to mention that, eh, also on the bike was Jessica Dorrell, a 26-year-old former Razorbacks volleyball player who worked as the student-athlete development coordinator for the football program. It turned out that Petrino, a married father of four, was not only having an affair with Dorrell (who was engaged at the time), but was a key voice on the board that hired her for the position when she wasn't even remotely qualified. During an ensuing university investigation, it was determined that Petrino made a previously undisclosed $20,000 cash gift to Dorrell as a Christmas present. Ho, ho, ho. To his credit, Jeff Long, the school's athletic director, defied the wishes of every pigskin-blinded Razorback fan and fired Petrino. In a statement, he rightly wrote that, ""all of these facts, individually and collectively, are clearly contrary to character and responsibilities of the person occupying the position of the Head Football Coach—an individual who should serve as a role model and a leader for our student-athlete."" Now, ethics and morals and character be damned, Bobby Petrino has returned, spewing off nonsense about second chances (Ever notice how garbage men and bus drivers rarely get the second chances we are all—according to fallen athletic figures—rightly afforded as Americans?) and learning from mistakes and making things right. Western Kentucky, a school with mediocre athletics and apparently, sub-mediocre standards, has turned to a person who lied to his last employer about the nature of an accident involving the mistress he allegedly hired to a university position she was unqualified to hold. Please, if you must, take a second to read that again. And again. And again. Bobby Petrino, holder of a Ph.D. in the Deceptive Arts (he also ditched the University of Louisville shortly after signing a long-term extension in 2007, and quit as coach of the Atlanta Falcons 13 game into his first season later that year. He informed his players via a note atop their lockers), will be the one charged with teaching the 17- and 18-year-old boys who decide to come to Bowling Green about not merely football, but life. He will be their guide. Their compass. Their role model. Bobby Petrino and social media prove a bad mix . Sadly, in the world of Division I sports, such is far from surprising. This has been a year unlike any other; one where the virtues of greed and the color of green don't merely cloak big-time college athletics, but control them. In case you haven't noticed, we are in the midst of a dizzying, nauseating game of Conference Jump, where colleges and universities—once determined to maintain geographic rivals in order to limit student travel—have lost their collective minds. The University of Maryland, a charter member of the ACC, is headed for the Big Ten. The Big East—formerly a power conference featuring the likes of Syracuse, Georgetown, St. John's and Connecticut—has added Boise State, San Diego State, Memphis, Houston, Southern Methodist and Navy. Idaho moved from the WAC to the Big Sky, Middle Tennessee State and Florida Atlantic went to Conference USA, the University of Denver—a member of the WAC for approximately 27 minutes—joined the Summit League. Which, to be honest, I didn't even know existed. Rest assured, none of these moves (literally, nary a one) were conducted with the best interests of so-called student-athletes in mind. New conferences tend to offer increased payouts, increased merchandising opportunities, increased exposure and increased opportunities to build a new stadium—one with 80,000 seats, 100 luxury boxes, $20 million naming rights, $9 hot dogs and the perfect spot for ESPN to broadcast its Home Depot pregame show. Why, within 24 hours of quarterback Johnny Manziel winning the Heisman Trophy, Texas A&M was hawking Heisman T-shirts for $24 on its website (Or, for a mere $54.98, one can purchase his No. 2 jersey). Percentage of the dough that winds up in Manziel's pocket? Zero. After another spectacular exit, Petrino eyes football return . That, really, is the rub of it all; of Petrino's crabgrass-like revival; of coaches bounding from one job for another (even as players can only do so after sitting out a year); of Rutgers moving west and San Diego State moving east and athletic department officials moving on up (to a penthouse apartment in the sky); of $54.98 jerseys. It's the athletes ultimately getting screwed. Sure, for the 0.5% of Division I football players who wind up in the NFL, the deal is a sweet one. The other 99.5%, however, are mere pawns, sold a dizzying narrative of glory and fame and lifelong achievement, but, more often than not, left uneducated, unfulfilled and physically battered. They are told a coach will be with them for four years—then watch as said figure takes a $2 million gig elsewhere but, hey, only because it was right for him and his family. They are told they will receive a great education, then find themselves stuck on a six-hour flight from California to Newark, New Jersey. They are told that these will be the greatest years of their life, that the college experience is a special one, that only the highest of standards exist. Then they meet their new coach: Bobby Petrino. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeff Pearlman.","Bobby Petrino was named the new football coach at Western Kentucky this week .

"London (CNN) -- Jacintha Saldanha should never have become a household name. But within a few hours of her apparent suicide after being duped by a radio prank call, the nurse's name was in headlines around the world. Her husband and two teenage children have said little, overwhelmed by the shocking death of a wife and mother thrust suddenly into the public eye. Read more: Radio personalities apologize for prank call to duchess's hospital . An inquest, expected to open Thursday, may shed more light on the reasons for her apparent decision to take her own life early Friday, three days after putting through the fateful call from two Australian DJs who impersonated Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles to gain medical details about Prince William's pregnant wife, Catherine. In the meantime, a picture is starting to emerge of a generous, caring woman who was caught up in a media maelstrom. Read more: Prank call pitted 'the great' against the powerless . The 46-year-old nurse moved to the UK from India a decade ago, and for the past four years, she had worked in the hospital where Catherine was being treated for acute morning sickness. She spent her time off duty in the family home in the southwestern city of Bristol, according to UK media reports. British lawmaker Keith Vaz -- who accompanied Saldanha's husband, Benedict Barboza, and their children, Lisha and Junal, on a visit to the hospital living quarters in central London where she was found dead -- said they were devastated by the loss of ""a loving mother and a loving wife."" With the family standing beside him, looking shell-shocked, he added: ""This is a close family. They are devastated by what has happened. They miss her every moment of every day, but they are really grateful to the support of the British public and to the public overseas."" UK media reports have quoted an online testimonial for her driving instructor in which Saldanha apparently described herself as ""a very nervous person."" Read more: Nurse death sparks outrage, casts glare on 'shock jocks' But for her classmates and colleagues back home in India, she was a deeply religious, benevolent and bold young woman. ""Jacintha was loving and caring,"" recalled the Rev. Sister Aileen Mathias, chief nursing officer at the Father Muller Medical College in the southern Indian city of Mangalore. Both trained at the institution's nursing school in the 1980s. Mathias still remembers her night shifts with Saldanha, who was a year her senior. ""She would share her bread, coffee and sweets with the patients,"" Mathias said as she reminisced about her time with her old friend. Saldanha, at that time single, was a nursing student from 1984 to 1988 and said to be a devout Catholic. Read more: Hospital slams prank call radio station over nurse's death . ""She was very religious. She will pray for the patients. Both of us will pray together for the patients,"" Mathias said. Last year, Saldanha visited her alma mater and donated money for the needy receiving treatment at the hospital, the nursing chief said. ""Jacintha was a generous person. She would help patients whenever she was here."" A condolence message posted on the website of Mangalore's Father Muller Charitable Institutions described the late mother of two as a ""dedicated and caring nurse."" But Mathias also recollected Saldanha's lighter side. ""She was a forward-looking girl. And she was very humorous. We cracked jokes. It was fun being together."" Read more: Australian prank call radio station boss calls nurse's death 'truly tragic' Her friends have not forgotten her diligence in her studies. ""Jacintha was pretty studious. She would often score as much as 75% or even more (in exams). And she was an active participant in several activities of the college,"" Mathias said. Nathalia Martis, 46, was in Saldanha's class. She cannot believe that her classmate committed suicide. ""I was shocked to hear that. She was not that type who would do that,"" she said. Now a staff nurse herself at the Father Muller Hospital, Martis remembers Saldanha as a ""bold girl."" ""She was very good, polite, but a very bold girl. She was always ready to face any kind of a situation,"" Martis said of her friend. She praised Saldanha for her ""leading capacity."" Martis wouldn't elaborate, though, saying she doesn't remember specific incidents from more than 25 years ago. But she found Saldanha to be a decisive woman. ""She was a good decision-maker. ... I mean she will take quick decisions during problems,"" Martis said. A family acquaintance, Ivan D'Souza, also considered her a ""confident"" person. ""She was a student here at Father Muller. She was a confident girl. And that's what her teachers also tell us about her. She would not normally make mistakes,"" he said on the phone from Mangalore. ""We are not able to digest the news about her death."" Others back in Britain also praised her as a professional and caring person. Lord Glenarthur, chairman of the private King Edward VII's Hospital where she worked, described her as ""a first-class nurse who cared diligently for hundreds of patients."" And the hospital's chief executive, John Lofthouse, spoke of her as ""a much loved and valued colleague"" who would be greatly missed by her co-workers. For now, D'Souza said, much of Saldanha's family is in her birthplace, waiting for her body to arrive. ""We should get it as soon as possible,"" he said. The decision on when to fly her remains back to India is one for her relatives to make, London's Metropolitan Police said. So far, her family's most public expressions of grief have been made via Facebook. Barboza, Saldanha's husband, wrote over the weekend: ""I am devastated with the tragic loss of my beloved wife Jacintha in tragic circumstances. She will be laid to rest in Shirva, India."" Saldanha's daughter, whose Facebook page is headed by a photo of herself with her mother and brother, wrote: ""I miss you, I loveeee you. (Heart) Jacintha saldanha."" CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh reported from New Delhi; and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.","Friends of Jacintha Saldanha in India say she was a generous, caring woman .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Zsa Zsa Gabor underwent surgery for the removal of a blood clot Friday night, a complication relating to her recent hip replacement surgery, her publicist said. Gabor was rushed to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles after her husband called an ambulance to their Bel Air, California home, spokesman John Blanchette said. Gabor, 93, is expected to remain in the hospital for several days, Blanchette said, . The actress had returned home on Wednesday, three weeks after undergoing surgery to replace a hip broken in a fall from her bed. Gabor has been frail and ""pretty much confined to a wheelchair"" since a 2002 car accident, said her husband, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt. The crash happened when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. The glamorous Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is most famous for her many marriages. Among her other husbands was Oscar-winning actor George Sanders. Her more prominent films include John Huston's 1952 Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, ""Moulin Rouge,"" ""The Story of Three Loves"" in 1953, ""The Girl in the Kremlin"" in 1957 and Orson Welles' 1958 classic, ""Touch of Evil.""","Gabor's blood clot was a complication from hip surgery .

"Washington (CNN) -- The nation's top intelligence officials told senators they used not only intelligence but clues in social media to keep abreast of recent uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa, but they admitted the task is a daunting one given the overwhelming amount of information available. The officials were defending intelligence community efforts at the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, during which Chairwoman Diane Feinstein, D-California, questioned whether the CIA and other agencies were adequately following clues in social media in the lead-up to popular revolts that deposed the leaders of Tunisia and Egypt and have sprung up in other countries. ""I think we were at fault in that regard,"" she said. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended the efforts of the open source center in tracking all media, but acknowledged more needed to be done. CIA Director Leon Panetta told the lawmakers there is a massive amount of data out there to follow -- 600 million Facebook accounts, 190 million Twitter accounts and 35,000 hours of YouTube videos. He said, ""The real challenge is how to be able, going through the diversity of languages, going through the different sites that are out there, how do we look at the relevant websites to be able to draw from them the kind of information that would help us so this involves a tremendous amount of analysis."" Both Clapper and Panetta added that the social media sites are not necessarily predictive of what might happen. Clapper sought to clarify a comment that was roundly criticized when he said the fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt was a ""secular"" group. He told the assembled senators that he regretted that his comment last week was misunderstood and that his message was lost. ""The Muslim Brotherhood is obviously not secular. What I had hoped to convey and I would like to clearly state here is, the Muslim Brotherhood attempts to work through a political system that has been largely secular in its orientation,"" Clapper said. He went on to say the Muslim Brotherhood would likely be part of the process in Egypt, as would many other opposition groups. Feinstein expressed concern about whether U.S. intelligence knew enough about the Brotherhood's positions. Clapper was unable to give definitive answers to a series of questions she posed about whether the group supported Egypt's peace agreement with Israel, had ties to Iran and if it supported efforts to stop weapons from going into Gaza. Noting that the Brotherhood has been portrayed by some as desiring a secular government, Feinstein cautioned, ""From an intelligence standpoint, it is critical that we know that position and what is apt to happen. Egypt is the key country in the Middle East and I worry about that."" The ability of the United States to handle current and future terrorist suspects was also on the minds of many senators during the annual hearing on world threats. Panetta was asked what would happen if al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden or his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, were captured. ""We would probably move them quickly into military jurisdiction at Bagram for questioning and then eventually move them into Gitmo,"" said Panetta, referring to the Bagram U.S. Air Force Base in Afghanistan and the Guantanamo Bay detention facility in Cuba. Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, the ranking Republican on the committee, agreed Guantanamo would be the best place for them to go, but pointed out the Obama administration is moving to close the facility. After the hearing, CIA spokesman George Little issued a statement clarifying Panetta's remarks: ""As Director Clapper made clear, and as Director Panetta agrees, any decision about what might happen if Osama bin Laden and other terrorists are captured would be a decision for policymakers, and would have to be informed by the circumstances of his capture. The Director fully supports the President's commitment to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay because, as our military commanders have made clear, it's in our national security interest to do so."" A senior counterterrorism official also said, ""The odds of Bin Laden and Zawahiri being captured alive are about as good as vodka losing favor among Russians."" Two years ago, President Barack Obama announced his intention to close the facility, a policy which has been heavily criticized by Republican members of Congress. The administration is still trying to sort out what to do with the 172 suspected terrorists who remain at the facility. Some will be put on trial although it is unclear where and whether it will be before a civilian or military court. A number will be sent to other countries if arrangements can be worked out. And there is the question of what to do with the detainees who can not be tried and there is no other nation willing or able to take them. Chambliss also pointed out that a quarter of released detainees return to the battlefield. Clapper noted that the president suspended repatriations to Yemen because that country does not properly monitor or rehabilitate the former prisoners. Feinstein brought up her growing concern with Pakistan's failure to adequately cooperate with the U.S. on counterterrorism efforts. She accused the Pakistani intelligence service of taking both sides of the street and cited the military's failure to pursue terrorists in North Waziristan. Panetta said that although the Pakistanis have helped in some areas, it is a very complicated relationship that requires him to be part CIA director, part diplomat. ""They look at issues related to their national interests and take steps that further complicate our relationship and create tensions between our country and theirs,"" Panetta said. ""What I try to convince the Pakistanis of is that we have a common enemy and we have common issues that require partnership and cooperation of both countries in order to be able to deal with those threats.""","CIA chief, national intelligence director testify before Senate Intelligence Committee .

"(CNN) -- For students, parents and teachers in Chardon, Ohio, the week has been a disorienting one after a high school shooting left three teenagers dead. As the community of 5,100 tries to regain the normalcy that was shattered by violence, the Chardon school district has decided to resume classes Friday. Throughout the week, the school system has offered counseling. Teachers and staff members were asked to return to school, where they could meet with counselors, on Wednesday. Parents and students were also encouraged to come to campus on Thursday, when counseling will also be offered. After such a traumatic incident, counselors focus on two stages of recovery: the immediate response of helping people feel safe and the longer-term process of helping them cope. Tom Olbrich, disaster response coordinator at the Jefferson Center for Mental Health in Wheat Ridge, Colorado, worked with youth, faculty and families in the aftermath of the 1999 Columbine High School shootings. After thousands of hours with them, Olbrich and his colleagues learned that there's no quick fix. Some kids required as many as three years of assistance. There's a wide range of reactions, and it could depend on how close they were to the kids who were hurt and what they witnessed, he said. For families who lost children and students who lost friends, it's a much more difficult struggle. Most people process the events and heal, but about 8% to 15% are likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder, said Russell T. Jones, professor of psychology at Virginia Tech, who counseled survivors of the shootings there. After a school shooting, students may be reluctant to return to classes and resume their normal academic life, experts say. On Monday morning, a student identified as T.J. Lane fired shots in the Chardon High School cafeteria. Police say the 17-year-old sophomore confessed to firing 10 rounds and was described by the county prosecutor as having chosen his victims ""at random."" The victims are Daniel Parmertor, 16, a teen who loved to ski and found work maintaining the computerized pins at the local bowling alley, who died Monday; Demetrius Hewlin, 16, who died Tuesday morning; and Russell King Jr., 17, who was declared brain dead early Tuesday. Two others were injured. There is an expectation of safety at school, so it's natural for students, parents and staff members to feel angry, shocked and scared. At this point, the children are probably receiving traumatic stress event counseling, said Dominick Flarey, the executive director of the American Academy of Grief Counseling. He is not involved in the counseling of the Chardon High School students. ""The first need of the kids is going to be to feel safe and doing what they can to make the kids in the high school understand that they are safe,"" he said. In the short term, counselors help connect kids, parents and faculty with their natural supports such as friends, family and others whom they're comfortable being around, to emphasize feelings of safety. Children may have fears about going back to school, which counselors try to assuage by identifying whom the child can be with in order to feel safe. ""Kids are going to go through a range of reactions in the next days and weeks,"" Olbrich said . Parents have also been through distress, because they were probably panicking over the safety of their kids, Flarey said. The initial counseling can reassure people that it's OK to be upset. ""It's not swept under the rug and 'let's pretend it didn't happen,' "" Flarey said. After the shootings at Virginia Tech that left 32 students dead in April 2007, Jones, a clinical psychologist, was one of the counselors who went into classes to discuss the symptoms of depression, acute stress disorder and PTSD. Virginia Tech students find support, outlet for grief online . ""People typically have nightmares,"" Jones said. ""People are angry. People are typically having difficulty concentrating; they might be irritable. They might snap at others. They might have tendency to avoid the situation. All of these are very normal reactions."" For most people, it takes days and weeks to move on with their routines. ""What we try to tell individuals is that one can expect that to happen,"" he said. ""They are not 'crazy.' Those are very normal reactions to abnormal actions. That's comforting to most individuals."" Those who had symptoms persisting beyond a month were encouraged to see mental health specialists, Jones said. ""The classic response is avoidance, because people don't want to think about it or go to places that remind them of it,"" Jones said. Research published by Jones and his colleagues in 2011 found that 15.4% of Virginia Tech students experienced high levels of post-traumatic stress three to four months after the shootings. Life at Virginia Tech a year later . Some of the ""real therapy"" happens when the initial shock wears off, Olbrich said. Olbrich and his colleagues ran several support groups after the shootings at Columbine High School in 1999, still the deadliest event at an American high school, in which 12 students and a teacher died. Debunking the myths of Columbine, 10 years later . In group therapy sessions, the counselors tried to group kids together who had similar levels of exposure to the incident. For instance, students in the library had some of the worst experiences, as this is where much of the massacre took place and where the two shooters killed themselves. Ideally, these kids would not be in the support group with students who saw or heard different things. ""If you mix those groups, there's a risk that the stories they tell could actually re-traumatize kids who didn't see that,"" Olbrich said. In Columbine, the demand for services related to that shooting hit its peak a year and a half after the shooting, Olbrich said. Traumatic memories flooded back for some when they heard helicopters, since there were a lot of helicopters in the air on the day of the Columbine shooting. Nothing the same after Columbine . There were ongoing programs for up to three years after the shooting, but not everyone needed that extended support. A small number of people affected by the incident, to this day, struggle with memories that come back on occasions such as the anniversary of the shooting, Olbrich said. At Virginia Tech, Jones said, some individuals present at the shooting didn't come forward for treatment until 4Â½ years later. Students should be encouraged to talk about it with their support system when they're ready, said Jones. ""Children and families should not be forced to talk about it, because compulsive retelling has adverse effects on individuals,"" he said. Another strategy is to encourage adolescents to write their feelings in a journal, Flarey said. ""When emotions stay stuck within themselves, that's when grief tends to become more complicated,"" he said. An adolescent's recovery from a tragedy like this can be a long process that's very individual. Some kids bounced right back; others took more time. The community still remembers the event but has largely moved forward, Olbrich said of Columbine. ""Sometimes, people talk about wanting to get back to normal. And you sort of have to help people realize that it's never going to be quite the way it was,"" he said. ""There will be a new normal you reach, but it will be different than how things were before. But it can still be good, and you can be productive, and you can get through this and come out of it even stronger."" CNN's Jacque Wilson contributed to this story.","Chardon, Ohio, schools open for counseling for teachers, parents and students .

"Washington (CNN) -- You want close? We've got close! Seven of the eight national polls released since Sunday indicate the race for the White House is in a dead heat, like most have shown for weeks. More importantly, it's a similar story in the key battleground states that will decide whether President Barack Obama or Republican nominee Mitt Romney will be victorious on Tuesday. According to the final CNN/ORC International poll released before the election on Sunday night, 49% of likely voters questioned in the survey say they support the president, with an equal amount saying they back the former Massachusetts governor. What to watch for . But it's not just the horse-race numbers that show how equally divided American voters are over the two candidates. According to the CNN poll, the president's favorable rating stands at 52% in the poll, with Romney at 51%; 51% say they agree with Obama on important issues and 50% say the same thing about Romney; 56% say that Obama has the personal qualities a president should have, with 55% feeling the same about the Republican nominee. Does either party have an edge on enthusiasm? ""The CNN survey indicates the answer is no. Seventy percent of registered voters who describe themselves as Democrats say they are extremely or very enthusiastic about voting, with an equal amount of self-described Republicans saying the same thing,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. Margin of error: Two candidates, two journeys, one race of lost dreams . And the survey indicated that 49% say they will vote for the GOP candidate for Congress in their district; with 48% saying they will choose the Democrat. That's where the similarities end. There are also some stark differences. When it comes to the racial breakdown, 40% of white voters questioned in the CNN poll said they are supporting Obama, with 57% backing Romney. The vote by race could be crucial to determining which candidate wins the White House. ""The formula for victory for Obama is to win at least 80% of minorities and around 40% of whites, if minorities represent the 26% of voters that they constituted last time,"" said CNN Senior Political Analyst and National Journal Editorial Director Ron Brownstein. Poll of Polls: Margin is thin in New Hampshire, Iowa . ""The final wave of public polls all show Obama running right around that tipping point, among both whites and minorities, which means nothing looms larger than the racial composition of the electorate."" Obama obviously benefits if the minority share of the vote increases even by a point or two. The flip side is that if the minority share declines at all, the math gets better for the GOP challenger. ""And if it remains unchanged, we're on the knife's edge,"" Brownstein added. ""But just remember, the minority share of the vote has increased, and the white share has decreased, in every presidential election since 1992. Just holding the minority share steady, much less seeing it decline, will require a huge turnout among older and conservative whites, which is the last hope for Republicans looking at most public polls showing Obama holding a narrow, but steady, edge, especially in the battleground states."" CNN Poll of Polls: Ohio a close contest on eve of election . The CNN poll was one of seven national nonpartisan, live operator surveys released Sunday and Monday to indicate the battle for the presidency either a dead heat or virtually tied. A Politico/George Washington University survey has it tied at 48%; an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll indicates Obama at 48% and Romney at 47%; the latest ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll puts Obama at 49% and Romney at 48%; Gallup's latest daily tracking poll had Romney at 49% and Obama at 48%; American Research Group had it deadlocked at 49% and Monmouth University had it all tied upat 48%. A Pew Research Center survey released Sunday indicates the president at 50% and the GOP challenger at 47%, which is within the survey's sampling error. While the national polls are revealing, the battleground state surveys are what matter most, since the race for the White House is a battle for electoral votes. And it's the eight swing states that will end up determining which candidate comes out on top on Tuesday. Of all the toss-up states, Ohio and it's 18 electoral votes has gotten the most attention because many scenarios see the election being decided there. Both the president and the former Massachusetts governor hold campaign rallies in Columbus, the state's capital, on Monday, the final day of campaigning. Provisional ballots could be key if Ohio margin razor thin . A new CNN Poll of Polls compiled and released Monday show Obama at 50% and Romney at 47% among likely voters in the Buckeye State. The CNN Poll of Polls is an average of three Ohio polls of likely voters conducted in the last week: Ohio Poll/University of Cincinnati; CNN/ORC International and NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist. The Poll of Polls does not have a sampling error. Florida, where 29 electoral votes are up for grabs, is also getting outsized attention and two polls released on Friday tell very different stories. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey gave the president a razor-thin 49%-47% edge, within the poll's sampling error. But a Mason-Dixon survey conducted for many of the Sunshine State's major newspapers indicated Romeny ahead 51%-45%. Four years ago Obama become the first Democrat to capture Virginia in a presidential election since 1964. The battle for the state's 13 electoral votes appears to be extremely close this time around. An NBC/WSJ/Marist survey released early Monday morning indicated Obama at 48% and Romney at 47%. The president closes his campaign on Monday night in Iowa. Then-Sen. Obama's victory in the 2008 Iowa Democratic caucuses launched him towards the White House. The Hawkeye State is also a general election battleground, and a new CNN Poll of Polls that averages all three non-partisan, live operator surveys conducted over the past week indicates Obama with a 48%-45% edge. Romney closes his campaign Monday night in New Hampshire, the state were he officially launched his bid for the White House nearly a year and a half ago. Besides holding the first in the nation primary, the Granite State is also a general election battleground, and a new CNN Poll of Polls that averages all three non-partisan, live operator surveys conducted over the past week indicates Obama with a 50%-38% edge. In the two Western battlegrounds, the most recent polls in Colorado (by CNN/ORC and American Research Group) indicated the race all knotted up. And in Nevada, an NBC/WSJ/Marist survey indicated the president with the edge and an ARG poll gave Romney a slight advantage. The only state where the president appears to have a solid single digit advantage according to public opinion polls is Wisconsin, home to GOP running mate Rep. Paul Ryan. A CNN Poll of Polls of the three most recent surveys indicates the president with a seven point advantage in Wisconsin. Of course the only numbers that really matter are the numbers we'll get on Tuesday. Romney breaks tradition with Election Day campaigning .","Seven of eight national polls show race is in a dead heat .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A man suspected in three pipe bomb attacks in Virginia was arrested in Montana Thursday after a police chase, law enforcement officials said. Laurence Stewart II allegedly threw several pipe bombs at law enforcement officers during the pursuit. According to a press release issued by the Stafford County Virginia Sheriff's Office, officers disabled Stewart's car and he was captured as he tried to run away on foot armed with a handgun. It appears no shots were fired. The charges against Stewart, 25, include two counts of attempted capital murder of a law enforcement officer, arson, and use of a weapon or device for an act of terror. According to Virginia law enforcement officials, Stewart targeted two Stafford County law enforcement officers and a former girlfriend in three early morning pipe bomb attacks on Tuesday. No one was injured in the incidents. Officials said that Stewart was upset by pending legal action against him. ""We're extremely blessed that no individuals were hurt in his brazen attempt to stop law enforcement and the judicial process,"" Richard Marianos, Special Agent in Charge of the ATF's Washington Field Division told CNN. The ATF had 50 agents working on the case along with local law enforcement. Maj. Kenton Hickethier, a spokesman with the Montana Highway Patrol said Stewart is being detained at the Cascade County Detention Center and he did not know when he might be returned to Virginia to face charges.","Laurence Stewart II allegedly threw several pipe bombs at officers during pursuit .

"Aleppo, Syria (CNN) -- With the precision of a master chef, Sheik Omar adjusts the intensity of the flame under his pan. He mixes table sugar with a noxious chemical, letting it hiss and crackle. ""It's almost ready,"" he says, as the syrupy liquid darkens. Sheik Omar keeps his face hidden. Bomb makers always work in secret. He looks at us and his eyes are friendly and calm. Our crew is unafraid. He's clearly been at this for many years. He has all his fingers. A Syrian, he grew up existing with death and violence and a government that made people live in fear. So wouldn't a young man naturally fascinated with putting things together end up constructing weapons for a living? While he works in the kitchen of his family home in Aleppo Province, Sheik Omar tells us that he's a man of peace. Read more: What will 'recognizing' the opposition accomplish? He believes he doesn't have a choice but to make bombs. Foreign countries aren't helping the rebels enough to overtake the heavily armed forces that President Bashar al-Assad commands. The rebels need all the help they can get. Those men across the country, he says, have abandoned their regular lives teaching or selling clothes or being lawyers to come together and fight to get rid of that man. It's been nearly two years. They've lost their lives and families. At least 40,000 Syrians have died. Someone with his skills should do what he can. Sheik Omar shouts out the window to his kids playing in the yard. Bring your father more sugar, please! The kids bounce into the house, helping him, handing him ingredients. There are half-made bombs and rockets around the house. His wife is in another room. She isn't talking to us, which isn't strange. This is his interview, and she's showing deference. Sheik Omar tells us as he cooks that he used to work with an assistant. That was years ago when he was less experienced. There was an explosion, and the assistant died. Better to work alone, he says. Besides, he doesn't make much money at all doing this. He does this because he believes he has a purpose, and he's good at it. Sheik Omar tells us he trained in Libya in weapons making and fought alongside the Palestinians against the Israelis in the 1980s. He's always believed that Israel is the oppressor, and no matter what, the Palestinians have a right to their land. In his time as a soldier for the Palestinian cause, the Israelis caught him twice and detained him. What do you imagine happens to a man in that circumstance? But that was nothing, compared to what al-Assad is doing, he huffs. The Israelis, they had more mercy, Sheik Omar insists. Read more: U.S. branding of al-Nusra as terrorists may backfire . Human rights workers, journalists and Syrians fighting to oust the longtime president claim al-Assad has established torture centers around the country, chaining prisoners by their wrists for days, beating them and inflicting unspeakable pain. There have been reports of children being shot by regime snipers, stories of al-Assad's forces going door to door and murdering whole families. Al-Assad has claimed for these many months of violence that ""terrorists"" are attacking Syria, and the country has a right to defend itself. Sheik Omar shows us one of his latest creations. It's a sleek rocket that stands about three feet off the ground. The thing looks sophisticated. It's hard to tell he's cobbled it together from bits and pieces of unexploded ordinances fired by al-Assad's forces. Sheik Omar gingerly holds the rocket. ""From here to here, for example,"" he says, tracing his fingers along its body, ""It's our adjustment, as are the fins."" It's a crude device, like many of the ones he makes. Sometimes he would construct something and it would, mid-flight, turn around and shoot back at him. But these are the hazards he's willing to deal with. Sheik Omar uses the word democracy. Syria could be democratic, he believes. First the al-Assad regime must go. But that won't be the end. There will be a revolution after this one. There will be more bloodshed. Revolution begets revolution, he insists. It will take several cycles of violence before Syria can hope for peace. What other choice do people like him have? he asks. How else to get rid of the extremists? U.N. envoy: Political solution to Syria crisis 'still possible' CNN's Arwa Damon reported from Syria.

"(CNN) -- Dallas Cowboys teammates Josh Brent and Jerry Brown Jr. were ""like brothers"" and ""the best of friends,"" Brown's mother and grandmother said Monday, showing no ill will toward the man who may be responsible for the loss of their family member. The teammates were involved in a fiery weekend car crash. Brown was killed, and Brent was arrested on suspicion of intoxication manslaughter. He was released from jail Sunday on $500,000 bond. Asked whether she was angry when she heard that alcohol could have been a contributing factor in the crash, Brown's mother, Stacey Jackson, said that she was and that she feels for Brent and his family. ""I was upset, but I realize, you know, our youth today are young and stupid. And we was all once that age and we done things that we are not proud of,"" she said during an interview on CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" ""I know Josh Brent, and he's been part of our family since Jerry went to the University of Illinois. That's all I can do, is pray for him and his family because I know he's hurting just as well as we are because him and Jerry was like brothers."" A Mercedes Brent was driving flipped and caught fire early Saturday in Irving, Texas, the Dallas suburb where the Cowboys are based. Police said the car was traveling at high speed when it hit a curb. ""My heart, every part of me aches,"" Brown's grandmother, Theresa Clark, said on ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" ""That young man, Josh. I pray, I pray for him too because he has feelings and he has a heart. And he loved Jerry. They were the best of friends. I have no ill feelings toward him,"" she said. ""He was a beautiful friend."" Brown, 25, was an outside linebacker on the Dallas practice squad. In a statement issued through his agent Saturday night, Brent said he was ""devastated"" over the accident and ""filled with grief for the loss of my close friend and teammate, Jerry Brown."" ""I am also grief-stricken for his family, friends and all who were blessed enough to have known him. I will live with this horrific and tragic loss every day for the rest of my life,"" he said. Brent, 24, is in his third season with the Cowboys. The charge he faces is a second-degree felony that carries a potential two- to 20-year prison sentence with a maximum $10,000 fine. Brent pleaded guilty to a DUI charge in 2009, according to court records in Champaign, Illinois, where he played football with Brown at the University of Illinois. He received a 60-day sentence, a fine and 200 hours of community service.

"(CNN) -- The ink had barely dried on the order signed by Judge Sharon Lovelace Blackburn, allowing most of Alabama's anti-illegal immigration law to go into effect, when fear settled into some in the state's Hispanic community. ""We are in panic mode,"" said Maria Morales, an illegal immigrant living in Montgomery. The law known as HB56 is the strictest in the country, allowing police officers to ask about the legal status of people investigated for a crime, if reasonable suspicion exists, and detain them for immigration authorities. ""We cannot even go out and buy food,"" said Perla Perez, who has lived in Alabama for the past five years without legal status. The law also requires public schools to ask about the legal status of children born in foreign countries and that of their parents. ""I'm not afraid for myself,"" said Perez, who has two U.S.-born children. ""If they want to deport me, that is fine. But then what would happen to my children? Who will take care of them?"" The state said 1,171 Hispanic students were absent Wednesday, before official word of the immigration law. On Friday, after word of the new law, there were 1,988 absences in Alabama, an increase of 817 students, the state said. Tom Salter, spokesman for the Montgomery School District, said 200 children skipped school Thursday, the day the law went into effect. He said that number dropped to 100 Friday. Salter said their English-as-a-second-language department has reached out to about 400 of the estimated 1,200 Hispanic children enrolled in the system to encourage them to continue going to school. Larry Craven, the interim superintendent of the Alabama Department of Education, said in a news conference Friday that schools will comply with the law, checking the status of new students, but that nobody will be denied an education. Morales said that like herself, her children are undocumented, and she is afraid of the consequences of sending them to school. ""They are going to investigate us through our children,"" she said. Late Friday, the U.S. Department of Justice and the other plaintiffs filed a motion to enjoin the law until the 11th District Court in Atlanta has a chance to review the appeal. Judge Lovelace Blackburn has set a Tuesday evening deadline for all the parties to file the necessary arguments before proceeding. State Sen. Scott Beason said the ruling is a victory for the state of Alabama because it allowed most of the law to go into effect. ""We expect people to be here in the state of Alabama legally. We have open arms, we have all the hospitality we can muster for the people who come to the state of Alabama legally. But if you are here illegally, it's going to be a challenge,"" he said. Some immigrants are also planning for the worst. The owner of a Mexican food store, who asked not to be identified because he came to the United States illegally, was worried that he could not stay open. His business license expired last Friday, and he worries that he won't be able to renew it because now, he would be required to show a state-issued ID, which he doesn't have. He said he has asked a friend to file the proper paperwork so she can take care of their children in case he or his wife is deported. But even if he stays in business, he's facing tougher times. He says sales dropped by half after HB56 was first introduced and dropped even more when it was signed. ""Sometimes, we don't have enough money to pay our bills, so my wife has to take a job cleaning houses so we can make ends meet,"" he said. Late Thursday, a rumor began circulating among neighbors in a trailer park where many Hispanics live. In a few minutes, streets emptied and people called friends and family to warn them of a potential threat that never came.","HB56 could let police ask about legal status of people investigated for crime, detain them .

"Read a version of this story in Arabic. (Financial Times) -- White Britons no longer make up the majority of people in London for the first time, according to the latest census data which pointed to a cosmopolitan capital increasingly divergent from the national economy around it. The 2011 data also revealed a population of England and Wales that is generally better educated but less religious than it was a decade ago -- and less likely to live in a home that they own. The total population rose by 3.7m to 56.1m, an increase of 7 per cent from the previous census in 2001. Migration was responsible for 60 per cent of that growth -- 2.1m people. Of the 13 per cent of the population who were born outside the UK -- 7.5m residents -- just more than half arrived within the past 10 years. This compares with the 2001 census, when 9 per cent of the population was born outside the UK. The surge of immigration has been especially striking in London, where more than one in three people -- 37 per cent -- were born outside the UK. Only 45 per cent of London's population were white people of English, Scottish or Welsh heritage, according to the latest data, down from almost 60 per cent in 2001. This makes London the first UK region where white ethnic Britons have become a minority. The top source of new migrants to England and Wales overall for the decade was India -- supplanting Ireland in the decade to 2001 -- while the second-biggest source was Poland. In the 2001 census, Poland did not make the top 10. In another major deomographic shift, home ownership has fallen over the past 10 years, according to this latest data, marking the first decade-on-decade decline since detailed records began 60 years ago. The figures show how growing numbers of Britons are being locked out of the property market by high prices and a shortage of credit. The proportion of residents who either owned their home outright or owned with a mortgage fell to 64 per cent in 2011, from 68 per cent in 2001, said the Office for National Statistics. However, a bigger proportion, 31 per cent, owned their homes outright than they did a decade ago, highlighting a growing divergence between homeowners and those unable to get on the housing ladder. ""These figures confirm that home ownership is slipping further and further out of reach, no matter how hard people work or save,"" said Campbell Robb, chief executive of Shelter, the housing charity. ""Young people are living at home well into their 30s ... but unable to afford a place of their own."" The percentage of the population renting from private landlords rose 6 percentage points from a decade earlier to 15 per cent. Overall, the population of England and Wales has become better educated than it was a decade ago. A higher percentage have university degrees than have no qualifications, a reversal of the situation in 2001. Levels of educational attainment in London are far higher than the national averages, with 27.2 per cent of the national population having attained a university degree or better, compared with 44.7 per cent of those living in inner London. Indeed, in five of 14 inner London boroughs, more than half the population have university or equal level qualifications. And Britain is apparently becoming less religious. The question on religious affiliation is voluntary, so not all applicants may have answered it. However, the percentage identifying themselves as Christian fell to 59 per cent, from 72 per cent in 2001. Christianity was the only religious group to have experienced a fall in numbers, despite the growth in the population generally. The second-largest religious identity was none at all. In 2011, a quarter of the population said it had no religious affiliation, up from 15 per cent in 2001, according to the figures released by the Office for National Statistics on Tuesday. © The Financial Times Limited 2012 .","The latest census data shows that white Britons are no longer a majority in London .

"(CNN) -- Nearly two decades after the Srebrenica massacre left thousands of Muslim boys and men dead, a former Bosnian Serb intelligence chief was sentenced Wednesday to life in prison for his role in their slaughter. The Yugoslavia war crimes tribunal found Zdravko Tolimir guilty of genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide and other crimes committed in the eastern Bosnian town of Srebrenica, which was overrun by Serb forces in 1995 in what later was described as the worst atrocity on European soil since the Second World War. The killings, part of the war's so-called ""ethnic cleansing,"" were carried out by ultra-nationalist forces bent on carving up Bosnia based on religious and ethnic affiliations. Between 6,000 and 8,000 people were killed in the massacre, according to the United Nations. The court, based at The Hague, Netherlands, found that ""the harm inflicted upon these men rises to the level of serious bodily and mental harm and constitute acts of genocide."" Tolimir's trial had been one of 12 criminal proceedings reviewed by the United Nation's International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which has indicted 161 people for ""serious violations of humanitarian law"" occurring between 1991 and 2001. Tolimir is thought to have been a top aide to Ratko Mladic, a Bosnian Serb military commander captured in Serbia in 2011. Mladic was considered the last of the top commanders of the war to be accounted for and is currently on trial at The Hague for genocide. The 1992 to 1995 war in Bosnia war left tens of thousands dead, and hundreds of thousands displaced.","NEW: Between 6,000 and 8,000 people were killed in the massacre, the U.N. says .

"(CNN) -- Digging my hands deep into my pockets, I tucked my chin into my fleecy neck warmer and wriggled my toes to warm them up. Snowflakes had filled the sky with white and were now dusting the ground gently. There was something beautiful about it, although somehow that doesn't seem right to say -- because I was standing amid acres of wrecked homes -- or rather plots where homes once stood. Fifty meters away a cemetery's toppled gravestones stood awkwardly. One hundred meters beyond, at the foot of the hill, the scorched carcass of a school, grave and gray, watched over it all. I was in Ishinomaki, a fishing town on the Tohoku coast of Japan. It was one of the worst-hit areas by the earthquake and tsunami which struck the country on March 11th 2011. Nine months later, it was slowly plodding along the path to recovery. Sarah Outen: To world's end and back . Having finished the first stage of my human-powered journey from 'London2London: Via the World' in November after arriving in Tokyo on my bike, I had returned to Ishinomaki to volunteer with 'It's Not Just Mud' (INJM). The group had been set up earlier in the year by British chap Jamie El-Banna after quitting his job as an English teacher in Osaka and heading north to help. Having cycled through the town on my way to the capital, I decided I wanted to help and after a quick internet search came across Jamie and his group. I spent a week with INJM just before Christmas, living in the two houses that Jamie acquired via Twitter earlier this year -- at one point we had 20 of us from seven different countries, bringing with us varied backgrounds and stories. Tasks ranged from house clearing to cleaning, bleaching and pressure washing, carpentry and gardening, insulating and decorating and cooking. The day that stands out most for me was the snowy day at the foot of the hill. Here, our little group worked alongside a local woman, Matsumara-san, to plant some flowers and bulbs in the plot where her house once stood. Building has been forbidden here in future but Matsumara-san wanted her little garden amongst the rubble to remain as a memorial to the thousands of lives lost in the tsunami. As we knelt on the cold ground and worked the soil, gently introducing the plants and bulbs to their new home, we alternately chattered and giggled and remembered quietly. We planted the flowers in a heart shape, sketched out in the snow by Matsumara-san. I tried to imagine what it must feel like to be her. To be kneeling on the ground that you once called home, now empty and exposed. What it must feel like to look at your home town and see most of it destroyed. Only memories remain. I wandered off to pay my respects to this town and try and take it all in, treading carefully over the ground, aware that I had walked 'through' many lives in doing so - stepping easily over foundations where walls once contained families and histories and hopes and dreams. It reminded me of post-apocalyptic scenes from films and it still felt surreal, even though I had been there for a whole week. Once we had finished planting, Matsumara-san walked to the plot behind and knelt down, chin tucked into her fleece. She took the single flower which she had put aside and worked it carefully into the soil. This was the house of her elderly neighbor. Like nearly 18,000 others on the Japanese coast, she hadn't survived the tsunami in March. Tears rolled down my cheek as I stood and watched this final act of remembrance, perhaps the outpouring of all the emotions that I had felt that week as I played a tiny part in this huge journey of renewal. I interviewed Matsumara-san about her experience on March 11th and she told me how she and her husband had been at work. Her youngest daughter had been at home. Luckily she evacuated to the school and then the hill, but neither had known if the other was safe for hours and Matsumara-san still felt guilty about not hearing her daughter's repeated phone calls as she frantically decided what to do. Many people have left the region, adding to the existing issues of rural depopulation as young people flock to the cities. Ishinomaki has launched it's own revival programme, 'Ishinomaki 2.0', encouraging people to come back to the town and start a life there, supporting and promoting community projects and local business. With sensible and adequate investment, powered by the grit and tenacity that the Japanese are renowned for, I think there is hope that the scars can heal and the region will flourish one day. It is a beautiful area and has much to offer tourists -- it just needs time and resources, and an understanding that the threat posed by radiation is not a barrier to living in or visiting the region. It will be a long road to do so, but there is hope. I asked Matsumara-san what her hope was for the new year and she said that she wished for health and happiness for her family. She said that they would smile and recover one day, but that it was very difficult. Her closing words were thank yous -- to us for helping with her gardening and to everyone around the world for their support. My hope is that the people of Tohoku are not forgotten and that the support -- be it investment, sponsorship or volunteering- continues to grow. Having seen the hyperbole around the Daiichi plant meltdown and fallout at Fukushima, I hope that good sense will prevail and that propaganda can be used as a positive force and that truth and transparency are not lost. I shall return to Ishinomaki to volunteer again before I leave for my ocean row in April, and shall carry the Tohoku spirit and story with me as I head back home to London. For this expedition has shown me that we are all on journeys, whether rounding the world on a bike and boats or not. We are all one.","Sarah Outen took a different journey in the worst-hit area during the earthquake in Japan .

"(CNN) -- Online classified service Craigslist's decision to censor its adult services section is a ""good step but a continuing battle has to be fought,"" a leader in the fight against prostitution ads said on Sunday. ""I'm very pleased by this very solid and significant apparent step in the right direction,"" said Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who spearheaded a recent letter from 17 attorneys general urging Craigslist to discontinue its adult services section. ""I say apparent because we have received no definite or definitive word from Craigslist that the shutdown is permanent or complete,"" Blumenthal told CNN's Tom Foreman. Blumenthal said he wants to broaden his fight against online prostitution ads but that ""right now our focus is really on Craigslist."" ""We're taking it one step at a time,"" he said. ""We want to verify and confirm that Craigslist is in fact shutting down (its adult services section)."" The embattled website has been under fire for allegations that it promotes prostitution. ""These prostitution ads enable human trafficking and assaults on women,"" Blumenthal said Saturday. ""They are flagrant and rampant. Craigslist has lacked the wherewithal or will to effectively screen them out."" The section that usually reads ""adult services"" on Craigslist was replaced Saturday by the word ""censored."" It was not clear whether Craigslist removed the adult services and replaced them with the ""censored"" section, which had a link that was not active. But for users who accessed the account outside the United States, the adult services link was still active. Craigslist representatives said on Saturday that they will release a statement at a later time. ""If it remains shut down it will be a model for other sites, we hope, because Craigslist is by far the biggest,"" said Blumenthal, who is running for the U.S. Senate in Connecticut as a Democrat. He said that he would try to change federal laws to make it easier to prosecute sites like Craigslist. ""Craigslist says it cannot be held legally responsible for anything on its site,"" he said. ""My belief is strongly ... that we need to change that."" In the August 24 letter to Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster and founder Craig Newmark, the attorneys general wrote: ""The increasingly sharp public criticism of Craigslist's Adult Services section reflects a growing recognition that ads for prostitution -- including ads trafficking children -- are rampant on it."" Blumenthal said on Sunday that attorneys general from three more states have joined his campaign against Craigslist's adult services ads. Blumenthal didn't say which attorneys general joined the initial list of 17. A Craigslist spokeswoman said at the time that the site agreed with at least some of the letter. ""We strongly support the attorneys general desire to end trafficking in children and women, through the internet or by any other means,"" said Susan MacTavish Best, who handles press inquiries for Craigslist. ""We hope to work closely with them, as we are with experts at nonprofits and in law enforcement, to prevent misuse of our site in facilitation of trafficking, and to combat such crimes wherever they appear, online or offline."" In their letter, the attorneys general highlighted an open letter, which appeared as a Washington Post ad, in which two girls said they were sold for sex on Craigslist. When the ad came out, Buckmaster wrote a blog post in response that said, ""Craigslist is anxious to know that the perpetrators in these girls' cases are behind bars."" The letter also highlighted a report in May by CNN's Amber Lyon, who posted a fake ad for a girl's services in the adult section. She received 15 calls soliciting sex in three hours. Earlier this month, Lyon interviewed a woman named ""Jessica"" who sells sex on Craigslist. The woman said a Craigslist ad was ""the fastest, quickest way you're for sure going to see somebody that day."" In a later blog post, Buckmaster said Craigslist implemented manual screening of adult services ads in May 2009. ""Since that time, before being posted each individual ad is reviewed by an attorney,"" the post said. He said the attorneys are trained to enforce Craigslist's posting guidelines, ""which are stricter than those typically used by yellow pages, newspapers, or any other company that we are aware of."" Attorneys general from Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia made the request a week after accused ""Craigslist killer"" Philip Markoff committed suicide in jail. Markoff was charged with the April 2009 killing of Julissa Brisman. Boston Police said that Brisman, a model, advertised as a masseuse on Craigslist, and Markoff might have met her through the website. In 2008, under pressure from state prosecutors, the website raised the fees for posting adult services ads. In 2009, it started donating portions of the money generated by adult ads to charity. A CNN investigation of Craigslist's adult services section, which replaced ""erotic services ads"" two years ago, counted more than 7,000 ads in a single day. Many offered thinly veiled ""services"" for anything from $50 for a half-hour to $400 an hour.

"(CNN) -- In the wake of Michael Jackson's memorial service, the key question of how the pop superstar died remains unanswered, awaiting an official report from the Los Angeles County coroner. Michael Jackson, at 25, graced the cover of ""Thriller.""  The right photo shows him more than two decades later. But other mysteries abound, particularly related to Jackson's appearance, which changed dramatically from his early adulthood. His features changed, and the color of his skin lightened significantly over the last two decades of his life. When the face of the most recognizable entertainer in the world faded to near alabaster, the transformation struck a sensitive cultural spot. It intrigued and even offended people, spawning numerous articles and blog posts speculating about his metamorphosis. This week, a source involved with the investigation into Jackson's death said the singer's body was ""lily white from head to toe."" And another source said Jackson had ""paper-white skin. As white as a white T-shirt."" The singer denied changing his skin color for vanity reasons and repeatedly asserted that he had a disease called vitiligo, in which the immune system attacks cells that produce melanin, the pigment that determines skin color. The condition results in milky white spots. For some patients, the discolored spots can spread entirely across the body, leaving only freckles of the original skin color, although this is not very common, experts said. Jackson told Oprah Winfrey in a 1993 interview, ""I'm a black American. I am proud to be a black American. I am proud of my race, and I am proud of who I am. I have a lot of pride and dignity of who I am. ""I have a skin disorder that destroys the pigmentation of the skin. It's something I cannot help. When people make up stories that I don't like who I am, it hurts me,"" Jackson told Winfrey. Jackson's claims that he had vitiligo elicited both empathy and skepticism. Those familiar with the skin condition said vitiligo is commonly misunderstood because of its rarity. It affects approximately 1 percent of the world's population, according to the American Vitiligo Research Foundation. ""I have to wear sleeves and carry an umbrella,"" said Lee Thomas, who wrote a memoir called ""Turning White,"" which discusses his physical and mental struggles as an African-American man whose skin changes because of vitiligo. ""It totally makes sense to me."" And he even shared a common habit as the King of Pop. ""I got [white spots] on one of my hands, so I used to wear a glove to hold a microphone,"" said Thomas, an Emmy-winning TV news broadcaster in Detroit, Michigan. He first noticed white spots on his scalp when he was 25. Then the spots appeared on his hands. ""Before I got this, I thought, 'What's up with Michael Jackson?' "" Thomas said. ""Then I get the disease, and it's like, 'Holy crap, there really is a disease called vitiligo, and it does what?' "" Making assumptions about why or how a person's skin color changed is ""not malicious ignorance, but it is definitely ignorance,"" Thomas said. Vitiligo affects people of all races, but it is more visible in people with darker skin. The cause of the disorder is unknown, although family history plays a role. Topical ointments such as corticosteroids and oral medicine combined with ultraviolet light therapies are used to restore pigment to the skin. These treatments often have side effects including abnormal hair growth, thinning and over-darkening of the skin. They can be about 60 to 70 percent successful, said Dr. James Nordlund, a dermatologist who specializes in skin color disorders at Group Health Associates in Cincinnati, Ohio. ""The problem with vitiligo is, you end up with two colors,"" said Nordlund, a board member with the National Vitiligo Foundation. ""Everyone stares, wonders what's going on, and people ask if you had a burn. Kids ask what's wrong with you. It takes a tough soul to deal with that and not be affected."" He recalled one patient, an African-American woman with vitiligo who had patches across her hands and face. When she shopped in the grocery store, she would be followed, and every bit of produce and item she touched would be thrown away, he said. If treatment to restore the patient's natural color fails and the majority of a person's body is discolored, the next option is to lighten his or her skin to match the spots. ""People want to be their own color,"" Nordlund said. ""Most of the time, most want to be their own color, but if they can't, the second best is, 'Look, I'll be one color, and I'll be white.' "" Nordlund never treated Jackson but said the singer's use of the gloves and lipstick was consistent with the patterns of vitiligo, since the spots frequently first appear on the hands and face, including the lips. He said Jackson's representatives once reached out to several dermatologists, including him, to hold a symposium on vitiligo at the Neverland Ranch, but those plans never materialized. Despite such statements, the constant changes in his face-- as it became narrower and paler -- baffled and caused some unease. Bleaching or lightening one's skin for cosmetic reasons is much rarer in the United States than in Asian, African and Caribbean nations, dermatologists said. In some countries, people use over-the-counter and bootleg products -- some of which contain potentially toxic chemicals -- to lighten their skin. The controversial practice has been viewed as the psychological legacy of racism, where light skin was valued over darker skin. In the United States, lightening ointments are prescribed for spot treatments for scars, acne pits or discolored marks, said Dr. Melissa Piliang, a dermatologist at the Cleveland Clinic. There is no surgery to lighten the skin. In the United States, a powerful medication called Benoquin, also known as monobenzene, can be used to treat extreme cases of vitiligo. ""It's important to understand that this product actually removes pigment (not just lightens), which is more like being an albino,"" wrote Dr. Min-Wei Christine Lee, a cosmetic dermatologic surgeon and director of The East Bay Laser & Skin Care Center in Walnut Creek, California. ""Caucasian skin still has pigment even though it's 'white' -- skin treated with Benoquin has no pigment."" The process, though painless, is so tedious and lengthy that most people use Benoquin only on the visible areas of their body, such as their face, neck and arms, Nordlund said. Side effects include irritated, dry or itchy skin, and the results are permanent. The person applies the medication once a day, and it could take six months to two years to take away the coloring. Nordlund said he has heard of only one or two people who administered the ointment over their entire bodies; those processes took five to eight years. It leaves the person extremely sensitive to the sun. It's a decision that Lee Thomas may have to make one day. None of the treatments to bring back his natural pigment has worked. His face has become about 35 to 40 percent white, and he uses heavy makeup to even out the spots when he appears on television. ""I would have to consider it as an option,"" Thomas said of whether he would consider depigmentation if the discolored spots spread. ""When it gets to that point, I'll make that decision. Right now, I'm not there yet."" ""I'm a dark-skinned African-American and am proud of that. It would be really weird not to have any pigment at all.""","Those familiar with vitiligo say condition is commonly misunderstood .

"Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington (CNN) -- A 7-year-old Afghan girl testified Sunday that she hid behind her father as he was shot and killed during a shooting rampage in southern Afghanistan that U.S. military prosecutors say was carried about by an American soldier. The girl, identified as Robina, was one of a handful of Afghan children called to testify via satellite during an evidentiary hearing held at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, near Tacoma, Washington to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support the military's case against Staff Sgt. Robert Bales. Bales is charged with 16 counts of premeditated murder and six counts of attempted murder in the March 11 predawn attack on two villages in southern Afghanistan's Panjwai district. Afghan anger kept U.S. agents from killing scene . The outcome of the Article 32 hearing will determine whether Bales, 39, can be court-martialed or could even face the death penalty. Bales has not entered a plea in the case, though his attorneys have said he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and sustained a traumatic brain injury during a prior deployment to Iraq. Robina and another child were called to testify by Bales' attorney, John Henry Brown, who appeared to try to establish discrepancies between their testimonies and those of survivors who took the stand a day earlier. Robina recounted via satellite from a base in Kandahar province how in the early morning hours a gunman came into her family's compound near Camp Belambay, a small U.S. outpost. Her father, she said, cursed when he was shot in the legs. Then he was shot in the throat and the chest, she said. One of the bullets also hit her in the leg. ""I didn't realize I was shot until later,"" she said. Stunned friends recall good deeds of suspect . Another 7-year-old testified she was wounded during the rampage, shot in the head by a man who she described as wearing tan pants and a black t-shirt. Survivors who took the stand on Saturday described the shooter as an American wearing camouflage pants and a tan t-shirt. Brown also questioned the testimony of an Army criminal investigator, who interviewed a victim's wife, who said two American soldiers broke into her home during the rampage. Other witnesses have testified there was only one gunman, and the Army contends Bales acted alone. Afghan villagers describe slaying's horror . CNN's Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- South American champions Corinthians progressed to the final of the FIFA Club World Cup on Wednesday with a 1-0 win over Egyptian side Al-Ahly in Toyota, Japan. The defeat ended Al-Ahly's incredible run which had seen the Cairo team win the African Champions League despite domestic competition in Egypt being suspended following the death of more than 70 fans in February's Port Said stadium tragedy. The only goal of the game arrived on 29 minutes when Peru's Jose Paolo Guerrero found the back of the net with a header following Douglas' sublime outside-of-the-boot cross. The win means the Sao Paulo team will play European Champions Chelsea of England or Mexico's CONCACAF Champions League winners Monterrey in Sunday's Yokohama final. Corinthians, winners of the Copa Libertadores for the first time in their history earlier this year, were backed by thousands of passionate fans who had made the trip from Brazil. Al-Ahly rarely threatened, with the club now having to make do with a place in Sunday's third-place playoff. The seven-time African champions finished third in this competition in 2006. Meanwhile Corinthians hoards of fans will be hoping the club can repeat their 2000 success, when a team inspired by Edilson lifted the trophy on home soil after a penalty shootout win over Brazilian rivals Vasco da Gama -- a team that included the striking talents of Edmundo and Romario.

"(CNN) -- Tropical Cyclone Evan is battering the South Pacific with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph and gusts up to 144 mph, according to the Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center in Hawaii. And things might get worse. Forecasters predict Evan could get stronger over the next 36 hours, evolving into a more powerful Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 126 mph, as it creeps southwest, away from the Samoan islands and toward Fiji. Fiji's meteorological service said Evan was expected to arrive in that country's waters by Sunday. The National Weather Service in Pago Pago, American Samoa, canceled its gale warning Thursday, but reiterated high surf and small craft advisories for the islands, expecting gusts up to 35 mph, heavy rain and towering waves. There were reports of two deaths in Samoa, an independent country with a population of 183,000. American Samoa is a U.S. territory with a population of about 55,000. Journalist Cherelle Jackson told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. that there was heavy damage in the Samoan capital of Apia, with houses flattened by the storm. Storm surge and high surf, which the U.S. National Weather Service said could reach 20 feet in the islands, was making a mess of Apia, Jackson said, adding water and power service had been knocked out. Many of the open-style Samoan homes, or fales, which don't have windows or doors, sustained heavy damage, she said. ""I don't think we were well prepared because the warning didn't get serious until late last night,"" Jackson said in a phone interview with the Australian network. Jackson said food could be a problem once the storm passes because the trees that supply Samoan staples, such as breadfruit, taro and bananas, had taken a heavy hit from the storm's winds. ""The breadfruits are just all over the road,"" she said. The New Zealand high commissioner in Apia, Nick Hurley, told Radio New Zealand of heavy damage. ""From what I have seen and heard it has made a huge impact on, for a start, all the vegetation, the trees, the infrastructure, all around Apia the power is out. A lot of people don't have any water . The trees have snapped, in a lot of cases have actually come down across roads, crashed into the fale, onto the houses,"" Hurley is quoted as saying.

I didn't get to go because I had had a baby."" Garth's character, Kelly, did get shot at the very end of that episode. ""Yeah I got shot, but really I was having a baby,"" said Garth. ""Very symbolic. Become a mother, get shot. Become a mother, don't get to go on anymore vacations."" The conversation quickly turned into a retrospective about the disasters Kelly endured during her ""90210"" tenure. The fire: ""I had to wear that stupid scar makeup for months."" Kelly's fellow burn victim: ""The lesbian stalker, one of my favorites!"" Drug addiction: ""The coke days! Those were fun episodes. The dark eye makeup, black nails, I really went for it. Edgy."" 2013 will mark the 20-year high school reunion of the fictional West Beverly Hills High School Class of '93, and Garth isn't opposed to a potential reunion special. ""I've never been to a real reunion because I didn't graduate from a real high school so that would be pretty cool,"" she said. Garth was hard-pressed to come up with any on-set ""90210"" secrets that the fans don't already know, but she did come up with something rather shudder-worthy. ""There was a vending machine at The Peach Pit that had nuts and candy,"" said Garth. ""You know those ones where you put your quarter in and out comes a handful? It was maggots. There were actual maggots crawling inside it. It was so disgusting."" Another interesting fun fact: the house where the fire episode took place was the same house used for the exteriors of the Burnham family house in ""American Beauty"" and the Griswold family house in ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation."" That house sits on the Warner Brothers lot in Burbank, California, and its windows and trimmings are often altered to suit filming. Garth, who turned 40 earlier this year, remains friends with her ""Beverly Hills, 90210"" co-stars -- yes, even Shannen Doherty. She also still sees Tori Spelling and Ian Ziering, but remains closest with Luke Perry. ""Luke and I are actually doing a show,"" she said. ""We love working together so when we did that (Old Navy) commercial, he and I, specifically, have a very strong connection so we were like 'Let's make a show together. Let's work everyday with people we actually love.' So we're working on something now."" Details about the still-in-development show remain under wraps, but Garth and Perry are developing, creating and producing it. Garth, who starred alongside Amanda Bynes on the sitcom ""What I Like About You"" from 2002-2006, has not spoken to Bynes since the young actress' legal woes began mounting this year. ""I'll always have a special place for her in my heart,"" said Garth. ""You can't play sisters with somebody for four years and not love them and take them under your wing."" Garth and her husband, actor Peter Facinelli, split earlier this year after 11 years of marriage. Facinelli is now romantically linked to actress Jaimie Alexander, his co-star on Showtime's ""Nurse Jackie."" Garth and Facinelli share joint custody of their three daughters -- Luca, 15, Lola, 10, and Fiona, 6 -- whom they remain utterly devoted to. ""I have the girls for Christmas Day, and we're gonna have a traditional Christmas,"" said Garth, ""then we're traveling to see some friends in Virginia and then their dad's going to be taking them for a few days to go skiing or something. It's all new, this splitting of the holidays. It's definitely new. Definitely new and foreign; but I'm jumping in with both feet, and I'm going to make it the best holiday for my girls that I possibly can."" For all the ""Twilight"" fans wondering whether Garth has seen Facinelli's latest movie, ""Breaking Dawn - Part 2"": . ""I haven't,"" she said. ""My girls are all fans, and I support them loving it and loving the movie that their dad's in but, no, I haven't seen the new one."" Garth also admitted she hates being back on the dating scene. ""Who wants to date,"" she said. ""It's awful, and then add to it being photographed while doing it, and the scrutiny that that entails. It's impossible."" Garth also took the opportunity to clear up rumors that she likes mean guys. ""It went viral that I like bad boys, like mean people. No, I'm a little edgy so I like someone who has that edge. You can have that edge, and you might not notice it by looking at someone, but it's in there... I'm into nice guys!"" Garth told CNN that she doesn't have a ""type,"" per se. ""It's all about an energy,"" she said. ""If there's an energy between two people it doesn't matter what you look like or what you do for a living or where you live."" As the interview wrapped, Garth said she was heading straight to the airport. ""I'm gonna get a piece of pizza in the car on the way to the airport, maybe some crazy (street vendor) nuts. Hold the maggots.""","Jennie Garth and former ""90210"" co-star Luke Perry are developing a TV series together .

"(CNN) -- Two California prison inmates who authorities say directed members of their respective groups -- a street gang and a transnational organized crime syndicate -- to help them steal $8 million from people's bank accounts were sentenced Wednesday to 25 years in prison. Angus Brown, 36, and Arman Sharopetrosian, 33, were convicted of leading the ring from California's Avenal State Prison, where they were cellmates in 2009, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph McNally said. The case was one of two major federal indictments targeting the transnational Armenian Power crime group, to which Sharopetrosian belongs and which allegedly has ties to high-level crime figures in Armenia and elsewhere, authorities said. ""(Brown and Sharopetrosian) basically combined their skills to execute the bank fraud,"" McNally said. Brown, a street gang member, and Sharopetrosian directed non-imprisoned members of their groups to execute the scheme, in which they'd bribe bank insiders to get people's bank account and personal information, authorities said. The pair's associates would make out high-dollar checks from those accounts, forge the victims' signatures and then deposit the checks into accounts the conspirators established, prosecutors said. More than 500 victims in multiple states were targeted for a total of more than $8 million, McNally said. The conspirators mostly targeted older people, believing them to be less ""proficient in checking up on their accounts via the Internet,"" prosecutors said in court documents. Brown and Sharopetrosian had been nearing the end of their prison sentences. Brown was serving time for identity theft, and Sharopetrosian was in prison for shooting at an occupied vehicle and carrying a concealed weapon, authorities said. ""The goal ultimately was once those checks were deposited from the bank accounts, their associates on the outside would obtain the cash and split up the proceeds,"" McNally said. Sharopetrosian, of Burbank, California, was convicted in March of bank fraud conspiracy, bank fraud and aggravated bank fraud. Brown pleaded guilty in December to conspiracy to commit bank fraud conspiracy, bank fraud and aggravated identity theft. Sharopetrosian's attorney, Anthony Brooklier, said Wednesday that his client was addicted to heroin at the time, and that the addiction clouded his judgment. ""If feel bad for him and his family. It was a case where he was using drugs at the time, and he wasn't thinking clearly,"" said Brooklier, who added he intends to appeal his client's sentence. Brooklier contends that Sharopetrosian was involved for only a portion of the scheme's time line, and that no loss of money is directly attributable to Sharopetrosian. Brown's attorney, Rob Scott, said he'd also appeal the sentence, arguing that it was too long. ""In California, first-degree murder is 25 years to life in prison. This is bank fraud case, no violence, and here he is getting 25 years, the same (you can get) for murder,"" Scott said. ""Something seems counterintuitive about that."" Sharopetrosian is one of 70 defendants named in a racketeering indictment -- the second major case targeting Armenian Power, authorities said. Most have pleaded guilty, but the rest -- Sharopetrosian and 32 others -- are awaiting trial, McNally said. Both indictments were unsealed in February 2011. Members of Armenian Power have a heritage going back to Armenia and other Eastern Bloc countries, and the crime group started as a street gang in East Hollywood, California, in the 1980s, authorities said. Members identify themselves with tattoos, graffiti and gang clothing, but the organization is more concerned with racketeering than controlling ""turf,"" authorities have said. McNally said the two indictments have significantly disrupted the group. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this story.","Case partly targeted transnational Armenian Power organized crime group .

"(OPRAH.COM) -- Here's a little fact of life that took me by surprise: Roughly 23 million women in this country are 40 to 49 years of age and about 6,000 of us turn 50 every single day. We are a thoroughly undefined constituency. Some of us are what the wonderful Wendy Wasserstein used to call ""bachelor girls,"" some of us are married, and a lot of us have had trial separations that seemed to go just fine...at least for the husband (with the struggling rock band), who went on to become the ex-husband (with the thriving law practice). Many of us have demanding kids or aging parents or a little of each. We juggle jobs, mortgages, student loans, and cancer treatments with low-fat diets, low-impact aerobics, low-grade depressions, a strong sense of irony, a dark sense of humor, and a full-bodied cabernet. We are tired. We are very tired -- we've thought seriously about penciling in a nervous breakdown for ourselves, but we've been through everything the world has to throw at us so many times that it's damn near impossible to get nervous about much of anything. Despite (or perhaps because of) all the coulda, woulda, shoulda moments that have come and gone, we've learned how to have a good laugh, an impromptu party, and an impure thought (or two) on a semiregular basis. We consider our options, our alternatives, our exit strategies. We take notes, we plan ahead, but we always leave room for serendipity. We are an entire generation of women who are making up our lives as we go along. Oprah.com: What Oprah has learned though the years . I know that it's human nature to want to glorify the past and preserve it in a delicious, if often inaccurate, cotton-candied haze. But the truth is that part of me (that would be the part of me that now needs an underwire bra and a pair of Spanx) really does miss my 20s. I still had that new car smell. I still thought terrorism would stay confined to the other side of the world. On the home front, I still kept standing up for brides (as if they needed my assistance to stand) while waiting politely for it to be my turn. And because it never occurred to me that my turn wouldn't come, I devoted an inordinate amount of time to trying to decide whether my wedding gown should be white or ecru -- by the time I hit 35, I'd have been okay with paisley. The Web had not gone mainstream when I was in my 20s, so any surfing I did (and coming from Detroit, that wasn't much) was in the ocean. And I grant you, my rearview mirror might be a little bit rose-tinted, but if memory serves, those oceans were fairly clean. Come to think of it, the glaciers were glacial, the bees were alive and well, a can of tuna didn't require a warning from the surgeon general, and the climate wasn't making any sudden moves. Color me crazy, but I've always been a sucker for a nice solid layer of ozone parking itself between me and a death ray. I'm also a great believer in time off for good behavior. I crave solitude. I like being unreachable once in a while, and in those days it was no big deal if somebody couldn't track you down for half an hour. You see, in the 1980s, we didn't know from e-mail or cell phones or Facebook or GPS, and a BlackBerry was nothing more complicated than a healthy treat that was high in antioxidants -- only guess what? Nobody had ever heard of antioxidants. I didn't need a baby aspirin every night or a Lipitor every morning. And I swear to God (that's another thing, God was still around when I was in my 20s), the closest anybody seemed to come to a genuine eating disorder was picking at a mixed green salad on a blind date until it was okay to go home and scarf down the contents of your refrigerator. But before I start turning into my great-uncle Saul, who never fails to tell me how he could've bought the entire Upper East Side of Manhattan for $225 back in 1936 (""when an ear of corn still tasted like an ear of corn""), let me say this: As much as I miss those days, I'm delighted and relieved to be done with being young. One quick glance in the mirror is all I need to know that time is most definitely a thief. Wait, strike that: One glance and I usually think I'm holding up pretty well -- it's upon closer inspection, that moment when I take a deep breath, put on my glasses, and turn up the dimmer switch, that I'm reminded gravity is not my friend. But if time has robbed me of a little elasticity and a lot of naïveté, it's left a few things in their place. Thanks to nearly 48 years at the big dance, a million mistakes, and one extraordinary psychiatrist, I've finally achieved the occasional touch of clarity. I'm getting to be resourceful. I'm getting to be resilient, and I hope that on my better days, I'm getting to be a little more calm, a little more contemplative, a little more compassionate. Oprah.com: How to make your midlife matter . Sometimes I think being middle-aged isn't about learning a lot of new lessons so much as learning the same old ones again and again. Here are a few of the lessons I keep learning: . • It is never a good thing when a shrinking portion of the population controls a growing portion of the money. It tends to make incredibly decent, hardworking, middle-class people sort of jumpy, and the next thing you know Kirsten Dunst is playing Marie Antoinette in a Sofia Coppola extravaganza. • Anyone who looks okay in ochre will look even better not in ochre. • War and famine bad, James Franco and spaghetti carbonara good. • What doesn't kill me does not make me stronger. It makes me anxious, bitchy, and vulnerable...but nobody wants to see that embroidered on a pillow. • This isn't exactly an old lesson I keep learning, but given that I'm lucky enough to have my own column, I'd like to use it to set right an unfortunate mistake. Remember a few years ago when we all got together and decided that sleep was the new sex? I've come to believe that we were dead wrong. What do you say we make actual ouch-you're-on-my-hair, did-you-hear-the-baby, jeez-that-was-my-eye, messy, intimate, life-affirming, really, really fun sex the new sex?! Because here's the thing: Between the economy, the environment, and the powder keg that is Pakistan, nobody's getting any sleep anyway -- so as long as we're all lying there wide awake... • Dorothy Parker was a genius. She wrote a gem of a poem called ""Indian Summer."" It's very short, but I'm low on space, so I'll just cut to the end: . But now I know the things I know, . And do the things I do; . And if you do not like me so, . To hell, my love, with you! Bravo, Ms. Parker. And, finally, deep into my 40s, I couldn't agree with you more.

"(CNN) -- Returning home from the London 2012 Paralympic Games, I discovered the level of U.S. media coverage for a global sports event. Ten days of competition, 21 sports, and 503 events crammed into five-and-a-half hours of coverage. To think that we have 227 athletes who just returned home after representing Team USA at the largest Paralympic Games in history, where 2.7 million tickets were sold, and most Americans didn't even know about it. That hits home personally, not only because I am a Paralympian, but because four-and-a-half years ago I was like most Americans and didn't know about the Paralympics. Opinion: The Paralympics were brilliant, why weren't you watching? Before I was paralyzed, I didn't so much as know the word Paralympics even existed. I was raised in a well educated household in Minnesota, but I knew nothing about the Paralympics until after my paralysis in 2008. After I was paralyzed swimming saved me; swimming gave me hope again and allowed me to believe in what my future could hold. From disaster to triumph: A week in the life of Mallory Weggemann . Swimming, and being involved in the Paralympics, changed my life and changed me as a person. Silent voices . I saw how getting involved in not only the Paralympics, but athletics changed my life. I have heard countless stories of amazing ability that my fellow Team USA teammates displayed. But how many of them were and are heard? How many Paralympians are household names in the United States? How many households are aware of the Paralympics? The biggest difference I noticed though was the appreciation for Paralympic athletes overseas. During the Paralympics, when I left the village and went into London, people knew about the Games, not just knew about them but respected them and were following them. The media coverage was totally different there. You couldn't turn on the television without seeing it, much like it is during the Olympics here in the States. For me it is my hope that I can continue to help push the Paralympic movement forward for generations of athletes to come, just as those before me paved the way for opportunities I have been fortunate enough to experience. So it is a weird feeling being back home. Four years of waiting and working and just like that it is all over. I have spent time at home unpacking and organizing my things and it feels like yesterday I was packing my bags for the start of this adventure. I trained for four-and-a-half years and it is already over. I am back home and making plans as to what I do next, starting to plan my next four years as I begin training for the Rio 2016 Games. Overcoming adversity . I will be honest, coming home from London isn't what I expected it to be. My goal was to come home as the Games' most successful athlete; my goal was to bring home nine gold medals. As I got on the plane to return to Minnesota I carried one gold medal and one bronze, but I carried them with pride. What I had to go through to earn both of those medals makes them more meaningful than nine golds ever could be. That medal represents more than just a winning performance. That one gold medal represents hope, belief, overcoming adversity, a dream and my supporters who backed me throughout the entire journey. When I look at it I see everything I went through to get it, the ups and the downs, the joy and the pain. When I look at my gold medal, I see a dream that I made four-and-a-half years ago and the journey it took to achieve that dream. In life we all make plans. We have this idea of how things are supposed to go and when they don't go according to plan we often find ourselves disappointed. I feel that it is in those moments that we find who we are. Life doesn't go according to a plan. We can map it out, we can plan it, we can even envision it but often we find that life has a plan of its own. My life this past month had a plan of its own. It didn't matter that I had planned that moment for the past four years, it didn't matter that I had done everything in my power to try and control the situation. When the day came to a close the plan I had envisioned wasn't the plan that life had for me. Bubble . Over these past few weeks, as I have tried to understand what happened and make sense of it all, I have realized everything happens for a reason. There is a reason I was reclassified in London, there is a reason life threw me another curve ball, and there is a reason I am sitting here in a wheelchair. As I came back home, I continued to reflect on London and felt many emotions. As an athlete I have put a lot of thought into what I can do different next time. What can I change in my preparations over these next four years before the Rio 2016 Games? I have also found myself settling back into life. When I was in London we as athletes were in this little bubble, the village. We were away from the real world in many ways. We didn't think of what day of the week it was or what the date was, we thought of what day of competition it was. Most of us were cut off from the real world because our lovely cell phones didn't work internationally. But then we return home and real life hits. You no longer are completely focused on competition; you are no longer surrounded by other athletes in the bubble. You are home.","Swimmer Mallory Weggemann won gold in the women's S8 50m freestyle .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Michigan believe that they have found the body of a 5-year-old girl who disappeared while bicycling last week. Nevaeh Buchanan, 5, was last seen May 24 outside her apartment in Monroe, Michigan. Sheriff Tilman Crutchfield of Monroe County said the body appears to be that of Nevaeh Buchanan, who was last seen May 24 outside her apartment complex in Monroe, southwest of Detroit. The perpetrator remains at large, Crutchfield said. ""That person, to our knowledge, is still out there in the community,"" he said. ""In my opinion, it is a very sick or disturbed person we are looking for, a person that is able to abduct and murder an innocent 5-year-old child."" Crutchfield said the body was found buried on the bank of river in a rural area. ""There was a material present on the grave site ... that appeared to be some type of cement or concrete,"" he said at a news conference.

He had been following the missing child's case in the news, and he immediately thought of her, but ""then denial come in,"" he said. ""I didn't want it to be the child. I didn't want to be the one that found the child,"" he said. ""I didn't want it to be the child but I did know in my heart of hearts that it wasn't an animal, that it was somebody.

"London (CNN) -- A nurse who took a prank call from an Australian radio station apparently hanged herself using a scarf, but her reasons for pursuing that tragic course remain unclear. Jacintha Saldanha was found last Friday by work colleagues hanging from a wardrobe door at her hospital living quarters, a coroner's court in London heard Thursday. The nurse, who was married with two teenaged children, left three notes, two at the scene and a third with her belongings, Westminster Coroner's Court heard. The content of the notes was not disclosed. Read more: Who was Jacintha Saldanha? There were also ""some injuries to her wrist,"" Detective Chief Inspector James Harman said. The nurse put through the prank call December 4 to a nurse on the ward where Prince William's wife, Catherine, was being treated for acute morning sickness. Some details of her condition were given to the radio DJs, who impersonated Prince Charles and Queen Elizabeth II. The details around the circumstances of Saldanha's death emerged as an inquest -- a proceeding usually held in Britain when a death is sudden, unexplained or violent -- was opened. The coroner's court was told that Saldanha's body was formally identified Tuesday by her husband, Benedict Barboza. Police are looking at e-mails and telephone records, Harman said, and will speak to Saldanha's friends and co-workers about what could have led to her death. Opinion: Prank call pitted 'the great' against the powerless . At this time there are no suspicious circumstances, he said. Police will also be in touch with Australian police to find out what would be the best way of gathering evidence, Harman said. This could involve either going to Australia or collecting evidence remotely. Saldanha, whose tragic death triggered wide public anger against the radio station involved, Sydney-based 2Day FM, was represented at the coroner's court by co-workers from the hospital. The Australian Communications and Media Authority, the country's media watchdog, on Thursday opened a formal investigation into 2Day FM's broadcast of the prank call. Social media users blast 2DayFM radio hosts . ""The ACMA will be examining whether the licensee has complied with its broadcasting obligations,"" said chairman Chris Chapman. The station's owner, media network Southern Cross Austereo, pledged Tuesday to donate at least 500,000 Australian dollars (US$524,000) to a fund for the nurse's family. It lifted a moratorium on advertising Thursday, with all profits to the end of the year to go to the fund. The 46-year-old nurse, who moved to the UK from India a decade ago, had worked at King Edward VII's Hospital, where Catherine was being treated, for the past four years .

"Washington (CNN) -- In what now seems like a fairy tale scenario, Friday was supposed to conclude the 112th Congress, with members heading home for holiday cheer with their loved ones. Many were leaving town, including House Speaker John Boehner, but they'll be back next week as the year-end deadline looms for the automatic tax hikes and spending cuts of the fiscal cliff that economists fear could bring a recession. Boehner, the lead Republican negotiator on a possible agreement, met Thursday afternoon with President Barack Obama at the White House in their second face-to-face talks of the week. The 50-minute meeting that both sides described as ""frank"" produced no breakthrough on the core issue of whether tax rates will rise on the wealthiest Americans. Boehner planned to return to his home state of Ohio for the weekend, but will be available by phone if needed, according to one of his aides. He and the rest of the legislators will return Monday to work the congressional equivalent of overtime on reaching an agreement to reduce the nation's chronic federal deficits and debt by the end of the year -- less than three weeks away. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, is advising members the session could run up to Christmas, then break for the holiday and resume again before the new year. The 113th Congress is scheduled to convene on January 3. Fiscal cliff: It shouldn't be this hard . The inability to reach a deal so far reflects the ideological divide between Democrats and Republicans over the size and role of government. Fears that the negotiations could end without a comprehensive agreement, such as the deficit reduction talks between Obama and Boehner in 2011, is causing jitters among consumers and investors. Stock prices fell for a second straight day Friday as it became clear neither side appeared willing to budge. Obama insists on raising additional revenue through tax reform and higher rates on top income brackets as part of a package that would include spending cuts and cost savings from entitlement programs. His plan is to extend most of Bush-era tax cuts set to expire as part of the fiscal cliff, but letting rates on income over $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for families return to higher rates of the 1990s. ""That's the best thing for the economy, the best thing for American families,"" Obama told CNN California affiliate KCRA on Thursday. ""That will take the edge off things. We'll still have to deal with some deficits and debt problems, but it means 98% of Americans, 97% of small businesses will not see their taxes go up."" One simple, controversial fiscal cliff fix . Boehner and Republicans have reluctantly agreed to some new revenue, but they reject raising anyone's tax rates and instead propose eliminating deductions and loopholes. Before meeting Obama on Thursday, Boehner told reporters the president has yet to offer a plan that ""is truly balanced and begins to solve our spending problem."" Republicans note that 71% of every tax dollar now goes to support Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, as well as paying interest on the national debt, and they say the cost of those items would equal all federal tax revenue in 2026 unless changes are made. ""The president wants to pretend spending isn't the problem,"" Boehner said. ""That's why we don't have an agreement."" Minutes before he spoke, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi argued Obama and Congress already cut spending in budget battles of the past two years. Simply cutting more, she said, could hurt the economy. Daschle and Lott: Here's how to make a deal . ""You're not going to reduce the deficit by ... only cutting your way to it because you will cut the prospects for job creation, which produce revenue,"" Pelosi said. At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney complained Republicans haven't offered details on which deductions or loopholes they would eliminate to raise revenue. Regardless, he reiterated Obama will agree to a deal only if it involves tax rates going up for the top 2% of Americans and extending tax cuts for all others -- a proposal some Republicans have said they can accept as a first step to move beyond the deal-breaking dispute. Obama and Democrats want Boehner to hold a vote on the president's tax plan, which the Senate has passed. Boehner avoided a direct answer when asked Thursday about a possible vote. Even Asia worried about the 'cliff' Republican reluctance to raise tax rates stems from the conservative quest to shrink government and the percentage of federal spending as part of the overall economy. Traditionally, raising taxes to fund increased spending is much easier than lowering rates to reduce the money feeding the federal belly. Democrats argue that Republican efforts to reduce federal deficits through cost-cutting alone would worsen an already difficult situation for middle-class Americans facing stagnant wages, rising costs and reduced opportunity. In particular, Democrats consider entitlement programs to be the foundation of the social contract with Americans and therefore question pushes to cut them. Instead, they insist the programs can be strengthened through improved efficiency and other reforms, such as the $700 billion in Medicare savings under Obama's 2010 health care reform law. Polls consistently show the public favors Obama's position of raising taxes on wealthy Americans in order to minimize cuts. By the numbers: Fiscal cliff . Nearly half of Americans -- 49% -- approve the president's handling of the talks, compared with 25% who say Boehner is doing a good job, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Wednesday. Meanwhile, a Bloomberg National Poll found nearly two-thirds of respondents, including nearly 50% of Republicans, believe Obama's re-election gave him a mandate to seek higher taxes on the wealthy. Regardless of which side of the debate citizens fall, experts agree almost everyone will be affected if a deal isn't struck. Two former Senate majority leaders said Thursday both sides must be ready to compromise. ""The simplest way to put it is that we're at 24% spending, we're at 16% revenue,"" said Tom Daschle, a former Democratic senator from South Dakota. ""We've got to bring those two closer together, and that's how you get a balanced budget, and ultimately that's how you get fiscal responsibility. ... It can be done."" To Trent Lott, a former Republican senator from Mississippi, it comes down to the principal negotiators. ""There'll come a moment when the speaker ... and the president will have to make a decision,"" Lott said. ""But they need to do it in concert. ""It's like directing the orchestra. You've got to have the winds and the brass come together, and they're not quite there."" How is the fiscal cliff affecting you?

"Milwaukee, Wisconsin (CNN) -- During the course of his long run for the presidency, Mitt Romney has consistently presented himself to voters as a ""turnaround"" artist, or as his supporters have taken to calling him recently, a ""Mr. Fix-It."" In making his closing argument to voters that he should have that chance to take his government tool belt to Washington, Romney has vowed to ""bring people together,"" to govern as president. ""I've got be able to reach across the aisle and get good Democrats and good Republicans to work together,"" the former Massachusetts governor told a crowd in Jacksonville, Florida, on Wednesday. If Obama wins a second term ... ""My legislature was about 85% Democrat and it was not lost on me that to get anything done at all, and even to have my veto upheld, I had to have people across the aisle I could work with,"" he continued. Romney's critics insist the Republican candidate's bipartisan overtures are in need of a serious reality check. They look no farther than his statement to last February's gathering of the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington. ""I fought long odds in a deep blue state. But I was a severely conservative Republican governor,"" Romney told the conference. Romney defends his 'severely conservative' record . The words ""severely"" and ""conservative"" are no longer part of Romney pitch with the campaign in the home stretch. Asked how Romney's promises of bipartisanship align with what quickly became a YouTube moment at CPAC last winter, a senior campaign adviser argued the two claims are not mutually exclusive. ""As governor, he brought people together to deal with health care. He's brought people together to deal with a very big deficit that he had when he came into office,"" said Kevin Madden, one of Romney's top strategists. Mitt Romney: My vision for America . Trying to bring together competing ideas, philosophies . ""The governor has made a point that he is going to try to bring together all of the competing ideas and philosophies in Washington in order to tackle some of the big challenges. Does he recognize there is going to be opposition? Sure,"" Madden added. In fact, Romney's aides have quietly begun laying the groundwork for a presidential transition, should he win the White House. Dubbed the ""Readiness Project"" and led by former Utah Gov. Michael Leavitt, the transition team has already had at least one meeting with senior Republican lawmakers, a top congressional source told CNN. What would a Mormon White House look like? ""They're interested in recommendations for Cabinet posts,"" the congressional source, who was not authorized to speak about the subject publicly, said. The advance legwork could enable Romney to sidestep some of the problems he encountered nearly a decade ago when he entered the governor's office in Boston. Michael Widmer, a government watchdog with the non-partisan Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, said Romney's experience in the business world left him ill-prepared for the unwieldy mix of liberal lawmakers, advocacy groups and news media that confronted him. Who might serve on Romney's national security team . ""It was a rude awakening for the Romney administration,"" Widmer said. ""Early on, the legislature and the Romney administration were at loggerheads."" But his passage of health care reform in the state demonstrated the self-styled ""chief executive"" governor was able to find his way and work across party lines. ""There was a spirit of bipartisanship around health reform,"" Widmer said. The spirit was hard to miss. At the signing ceremony for his signature legislative achievement, Romney had none other than an old political nemesis and liberal icon, the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, at his side. After overcoming a GOP primary season in which Romney's health care reform plan was mocked as ""Obamneycare,"" aides to the former governor now dub the initiative ""successful."" Where candidates stand on key issues . Different environment than governor's office . If elected president, however, Romney would inherit a dramatically different political environment. Sandwiched between tea party Republicans who have little patience for compromise and a potentially vengeful contingent of defeated Democrats, a President Romney would have no shortage of challenges. Obama: My vision for America . Adding to the potential for gridlock, a longtime aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said the Democratic leader from Nevada hardly knows Romney. Earlier this year, Reid outraged conservatives when he falsely accused Romney of failing to pay income taxes for a decade. Reid hits Romney over taxes, '47%' comments . ""When he looks at Romney, he sees a weak candidate, a poll-driven politician, someone who lacks any core conviction,"" Reid's former spokesman Jim Manley said. One potential flashpoint could be any attempt by Romney to make good on a campaign promise to partially privatize the nation's Medicare system for future seniors. ""If he tries to go at core Democratic priorities, like Bush tried to do with his proposal to privatize Social Security, Reid will go at him hammer and tong, just like he and (Nancy) Pelosi did with Bush,"" Manley said of former President George W. Bush's second term initiative to transform the federal retirement program. Perhaps the greatest challenge facing a potential Romney administration would be the nation's mounting debt. It remains unclear whether the upcoming lame-duck Congress will have the political will necessary to avert what is a largely unspoken campaign issue, the looming fiscal cliff in Washington. Republicans and Democrats in Congress, along with the president, set the nation on the perilous legislative course when they passed the Budget Control Act, which mandates both tax increases and massive spending cuts that take effect at the end of the year, unless a compromise is reached. Candidates mum on fiscal cliff . If a solution is not found, Romney could enter the White House with a country that is reeling from what many economists agree would be a massive jolt to the economy. Facing resistance from tea party on more revenue . Back in Massachusetts, the then-governor solved his own fiscal crisis with a mixture of spending cuts and fee increases. But to conservative Republicans in Washington, revenue enhancers are viewed as deal-breakers. ""The tea party is not going to let him do that. The tea party is going to resist that mightily,"" Widmer said. But Romney made clear in the presidential debates he is comfortable shifting back to the center when it is politically advantageous. What Democrats label ""etch-a-sketching"" and ""Romnesia,"" one Romney aide said the candidate is simply articulating his positions in a way that would make them more palatable to ""swing voters."" Mitt's middle of the road makeover . After a sometimes painful, yet eventually successful wooing of tea party conservatives, Romney now openly embraces more centrist views on regulation. ""Sometimes people in our party say we want to deregulate but that's kind of an overstatement,"" Romney told the Jacksonville rally. ""We want to get rid of excessive regulation and outmoded regulation. But we have to have some regulation to make the economy work and for people to be able to play by the rules,"" he added. After a lifetime in business and Massachusetts politics, a President Romney would arrive in Washington as a newcomer. As Romney boasted during the GOP primaries, he would enter the nation's capital having never worked in the hyper-partisan world nestled on the Potomac River. Who might serve on Romney's national security team? Massachusetts accents in the White House . But do not expect Romney to be lonely at the White House. As recent history has shown, governors who ascend to the presidency, such as George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, usually have a colorful entourage of statehouse advisers and friends who come along for the ride. If Romney's management of this presidential campaign is any guide, he is likely to bring with him a slew of political professionals from his days in Boston. Several top advisers in Romney's inner circle, former Bain executive Bob White, Boston political strategist Peter Flaherty and communications guru Eric Fehrnstrom, speak with a thick Massachusetts accent. Another pivotal player to watch is Beth Myers, who was Romney's chief of staff during his days as governor and led his vice presidential search that culminated in what is widely regarded as the politically successful selection of U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. Exclusive: How Romney chose his running mate . Madden declined to discuss a potential senior team in a Romney White House but conceded the GOP contender has a history of taking care of his own. ""He is a loyal guy. But I think he wants the best and the brightest with him to help solve big problems,"" Madden said.","Mitt Romney has vowed, if elected, to ""bring people together""

"(EW.com) -- Since everything about Les Misérables is fortissimo — including but not limited to its unabashed pursuit of awards that are shiny or globular or both — you have perhaps already heard a little about the movie now storming the Bastille of your wallet. You may already know that to make his movie adaptation of the internationally popular theatrical musical conjured from the 19th-century political novel by Victor Hugo, director Tom Hooper (The King's Speech) bade his actors sing live during filming. You probably already know that Anne Hathaway, as the wretched single mother-turned-prostitute Fantine, is reputedly a formidable Oscar favorite for her sobbing and warbling and haircutting-in-real-time. You've learned, from posters and trailers, that Hugh Jackman, as former convict Jean Valjean, looks impressively stricken and that Russell Crowe, as implacable police inspector Javert, looks disconcertingly dyspeptic. What's left to learn is this: Les Misérables provides compelling reasons for Crowe to be peeved, beginning with the humiliation of having to sing Broadway-style, when it clearly is so not his thing, and ending with the Cap'n Crunch wardrobe into which the gentleman is packed. (O, for Crowe's costumed glory days in Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World!) Jackman has a right to be cranky too, although he's too much of a trouper to show it as he overemotes on demand and sings of finding God after he steals a pair of candlesticks from a nice priest. (Long story.) Hathaway looks happy enough channeling Liza Minnelli for her tremulous rendition of the Susan Boyle-appropriated anthem ''I Dreamed a Dream,'' but that's no doubt because she knows that soon after the song, she's pretty much done for the night. Shall I go on about all the ways in which this fake-opulent Les Miz made me long for guillotines while millions of viewers who have softer, more generous hearts than I may swoon with money's-worth contentment? (At least it doesn't skimp on length: The movie is approximately as long as the 1832 Paris uprising it depicts.) Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter mug and prance as the comic-relief grifters Thénardier and his missus, outfitted in what has become de rigueur for both BCs — Pétrouchka makeup and prosthetically grungy teeth. Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne play the young lovers Cosette (Fantine's muppet daughter, raised by Valjean) and the boy-band-styled student revolutionary Marius like lab rats, their pale faces and lashless eyelids often observed in the merciless close-up that is one of Hooper's mix-it-up signature shots. (He is similarly devoted to tilted perspective and the room-at-a-45-degree-angle shot.) It's a daunting challenge, to be sure, to turn a big musical into a viable movie. For every great Cabaret, My Fair Lady, and The King and I, there's a dud Rent, Evita, and Mamma Mia! But this steam-driven military weapon of an enterprise is a sobering reminder of just how tinny a musical Les Misérables was in the first place — the listless music and lyrics by Alain Boubil, Claude-Michel Schönberg, and Herbert Kretzmer, the derivative characters fashioned from Oliver! scraps. And even if you do come to Mr. Hooper's neighborhood loving the show, having seen seven stage productions and named your cat Gavroche after the urchin who hitches his fate to those of grown-up revolutionaries, well, you're in for a gobsmacking: This ''prestige'' production is at heart a minor road-show carnival, leaving behind little but tinsel as it rumbles through the streets of Awardstown.

"(AOL Autos) -- Regular readers of AOL Autos know that we have done a series of stories on the development and increasing popularity of cars that run -- or will eventually run -- on alternative fuels. The mandatory use of CNG in public service vehicles began in New Delhi, India in 2000. We've written about hybrids, clean-diesel engines, fuel-cell technology, ethanol and more. That brings us to another entry in the auto industry's ongoing research and development of green-technology: compressed natural gas (CNG). Scientists are trying to determine which alternative fuel will best strike a balance between being environmentally friendly and commercial viability. CNG might be the answer. Vehicles running on CNG have actually been around since the early 1990s, but have not been a dominant force in the marketplace mostly because the infrastructure (i.e. re-fueling stations) is not yet in place to support high-volume sales of CNG-powered cars. Presently, there are only about 1,600 CNG refueling stations in the U.S, compared with up to 200,000 gas stations. Currently there is only one CNG-powered model sold on the consumer market that is actually manufactured as a CNG-powered car. That's the Honda Civic GX, which boasts an EPA-estimated fuel economy of 24/36 miles per gasoline-gallon equivalent. AOL Autos: Best hybrids . Rich Kolodziej, president of Natural Gas Vehicles for America said there are other natural-gas-powered vehicles on the road -- about 130,000, he estimates -- but that the vast majority of those are part of commercial or transit fleets or have been converted from gasoline-powered cars. ""They're mostly fleet vehicles, like transit buses, delivery trucks, and the fleets maintained by the gas company, the electric company, etc,"" he said. ""We don't have hard figures about conversions, but I'd bet that about 25 percent of those 130,000 were once gasoline-powered vehicles that have been converted to CNG vehicles,"" Kolodziej said. ""There are a growing number of companies making certified conversion systems and installing them."" NGVAmerica maintains a list of certified conversion systems on its Web site: www.ngvc.org. AOL Autos: Fuel-efficient used cars . Some of those 130,000 are also natural-gas-powered vehicles manufactured and sold by Ford, Chrysler and GM back in the early '90s, he says -- back when the U.S. manufacturers were still in the business of making CNG-powered cars. But we'll get back to that later. But with the price of gasoline currently averaging over $4 a gallon nationally, Kolodziej predicts there will be more and more demand for CNG-powered vehicles like the Civic GX. ""I went to a conference a couple of months ago, and every manufacturer we talked to said that their phones were ringing off the hook, from people who are saying they'd be interested in buying a CNG-powered car,"" Kolodziej said. ""And there are more and more people and companies who want to get into the conversion business."" AOL Autos: Hybrid SUVs . The cost of conversions varies by the type of vehicle, Kolodziej noted. ""But most cost in the $10,000 range. Most conversion systems are certified for Ford and GM models, among others,"" he said. On the financial side, natural gas is about 30 percent less expensive than gasoline when it is purchased at a refueling station. It's about 50 percent less expensive when you fill 'er up at home, via home refueling appliance that tap into your natural gas line, Kolodziej said. Owners of the Honda Civic GX in New York and California who have natural gas piped into their homes can purchase the ""Phill"" re-fueling system for about $3,500. This Phill system can be used whether your CNG vehicle was manufactured that way or converted, he said. AOL Autos: Luxury cars with best gas mileage . ""The Phill is about the size of a pay phone, and you hang it on the garage wall, and vent it like a dryer and plug it into a gas line and also into an electric socket,"" Kolodziej explained. The primary environmental benefit of a CNG car is that it produces 90 percent fewer smog-forming pollutants (oxides of nitrogen), compared to the output of a conventional gas engine, said Steve Ellis, manager of alternative fuels for American Honda Motor Co. The Civic GX has reaped many environmental awards. This year, it was named by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) as the ""greenest vehicle in the nation -- for the fifth consecutive year."" The GX, which was first introduced in 1998, has the cleanest internal combustion certified by the EPA, Ellis noted. AOL Autos: Most-popular fuel-efficient cars . The Civic GX is not a high-volume vehicle in terms of sales. Ellis said annual sales have fluctuated between 500 to 1000 units a year since it was rolled out, with sales of 1,100 units last year. He expects that to go up in 2008. For comparison purposes, about 40,000 Honda Civic Hybrids were sold last year, with sales of 48,000 anticipated for this year. Most of the sales of the Civic GX are concentrated in southern California, followed by Phoenix and Salt Lake City -- primarily because those markets are where many of the 1,600 re-fueling stations are presently located. ""As the infrastructure builds up, we'll sell more of them in other markets,"" Ellis predicted. ""Right now, this is a car that people use regionally. If you live here in Los Angeles, you can drive to Las Vegas and back and not worry about being able to find a refueling station. As for cost, the GX natural-gas vehicle is priced at about $24,500, compared to $17,000 for a comparably-equipped Civic LX, Ellis said -- except that buyers get a $4,000 tax credit on the purchase of the GX. And until recently, California buyers got an additional $3,000 rebate from the California Air Resources Board. ""But the program was so popular, they are out of funds, and looking to add more money to the coffer so they can continue with the rebates,"" Ellis said. ""But people who buy a Civic GX, when we ask them about the math, in term of comparing those two Civics, they sort of give us blank stares,"" Ellis continued. ""Most of these folks who are buying the GX are trying to get out of having to commute to work every day in a pick-up truck, SUV or even a passenger car that's only getting 15 or 20 miles a gallon. And they're also the same kind of people who've said they'd pay $25 or $50 a week to be able to drive in the car-pool lane."" Interestingly, many of the automakers, like Volkswagen, Mercedes, Fiat, GM Opel, Ford Europe, Peugeot and Renault, do produce CNG-powered vehicles for other countries, said NGVAmerica's Kolodziej, who noted that ""about 1.5 million of the natural gas vehicles have been sold in Brazil, another 1.5 million in Argentina, another 1.5 million in Pakistan, and so on."" And, once upon a time, in the early '90s, U.S. automakers did sell CNG vehicles in the United States. ""But the federal government kept adding more loopholes to the energy policy that was supposed to encourage the increased manufacture and sales of CNG vehicles,"" Kolodziej said. ""Then the government opted not to expand the coverage of the program the way the law allowed -- or the way the automakers expected. Without that demand pull, the U.S. automakers didn't believe they could sell enough of them here."" ""U.S. automakers zigged when they probably should have zagged"" added Ellis of American Honda. ""They turned their backs on CNG and began to focus on bio-fuels."" But, noted Ellis, ""We're definitely keeping our stake in the CNG business, because we know we can add it to other platforms. We used to think of the Civic GX as 'The Little Engine That Could' -- you know, saying, 'I think I can, I think I can' in terms of becoming more commercially viable. ""But, with gas prices going up and up, now we're thinking more along the lines of 'I know I can, I know I can.' And more and more people are genuinely interested in going more green because of the environmental impact,"" he said. ""A lot of people got into the hybrids, and then, after a while, began to ask, 'How can I do more?' And they're looking to natural-gas-powered cars as the answer to that. ""So, we're in this for the long haul,"" noted Ellis, who said the company is definitely looking to do bigger business and make a profit from the GX. ""Now, it's just a matter of society continuing to change, and to continue to become more environmentally-minded. As they do, we think there will be increasing interest in CNG, and we'll see a shift in emphasis toward CNG and away from bio-fuels.""","Scientists trying to determine which alternative fuel is best for future .

"(CNN) -- I logged onto Facebook this afternoon, terrified of what I would read. I grew up near Newtown, Connecticut, and went to high school in Danbury, Connecticut. A close friend spent her childhood at Sandy Hook Elementary School, the school where a shooter killed at least 26 people today, police said, most of them children. Police reports are still coming in, and we are only beginning to grasp the scale of this tragedy. Friends are describing their panic as they try to reach their children in schools that are on lockdown. One of my high school classmates is trying to support her best friend, whose daughter was one of the children killed. My Facebook timeline is filled with expressions of relief for those who escaped the violence, sorrow for those lost, and prayers for recovery. It's also filled with friends demanding that America take action on gun control. Their calls are answered by others who protest that this is a time to mourn, not a time for politics. A tragedy like today's shooting demands we both mourn and take action. In April of this year, One L. Goh shot 10 nursing students at Oikos University in Oakland, California. In July, James Holmes shot 70 people in a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado. In August, Wade Michael Page shot 10 people in a Sikh gurdwara in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. With today's tragedy, 2012 is likely to be the worst year for mass gun violence in U.S. history. It follows a year in which a mass shooting killed six and critically injured Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. And on Tuesday two people killed when a gunman opened fire at a shopping mall in Oregon. News: 'Our hearts are broken' Outside of these mass shooting incidents covered by the media, 2012 is likely to be a bad one in terms of ""ordinary"" shootings. The CDC reports that 30,759 were treated in hospitals for gunshot wounds in 2011, a 47% increase over 2001. Homicide rates in the U.S. are going down while incidences of shootings are increasing, because doctors are now so experienced at treating gunshot wounds that they are saving more lives. Yet conventional wisdom argues that the U.S. is too polarized and divided for any meaningful changes to our broken and inadequate gun laws. The National Rifle Association and other lobbying groups are too well-funded and powerful for politicians to stand behind even modest gun control measures, like Sen. Frank Lautenberg's proposed ban on high-capacity magazines, which lapsed in 2004. Americans who follow the gun-control debate have stopped expecting change in the wake of events like today's shooting for the simple reason of precedent: If Aurora, Oak Creek, Tuscon and Columbine haven't changed the politics of gun control, why should we believe the tragedy in Newtown will have a different outcome? The NRA's most powerful weapon against gun control isn't postcard campaigns, primary battles or political advertising. It's silence. So long as we assume gun control is impossible, we don't talk about gun control. So long as we don't talk about gun control, gun control is impossible. The NRA fights any attempts to control firearms, no matter how common-sensical, because their greatest fear is public debate over any controls over guns. Once we begin discussing whether it's reasonable for civilians to be able to buy unlimited amounts of ammunition without a background check, we've moved gun control from the realm of the unthinkable into the possible. News: Support crucial for kids after trauma . It sounds reasonable and compassionate when New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie responded to the Aurora shootings by demanding, ""This is just not the appropriate time to be grandstanding about gun laws. Can we at least get through the initial grief and tragedy for these families?"" Christie, and my friends on Facebook who demand we mourn apolitically, have the best of intentions, but they are missing a simple truth. Moments like today's tragedy in Newtown remind us that the U.S. suffers from an epidemic of gun violence, a pattern that does not exist in other highly developed nations. Moments of crisis, like the shooting in Newtown, tend to produce brief spikes of popular interest in gun control. My research on media attention suggests these spikes are extremely short-lived, and that they may be decreasing in intensity. There was less popular interest in gun control, as measured by Google searches, after the Gabrielle Giffords shooting and the Aurora killings than after Virginia Tech. There were almost no spikes of popular interest in gun control after ""smaller"" mass shootings, like that in Oak Creek. To have any chance of combating the NRA's campaign of silence, gun control groups have to seize moments of media attention to push for change. When the story about the Newtown shooter comes out, it is likely that we will hear about a disturbed and deranged shooter and about ""senseless violence,"" as if to distinguish it from more sensible gun violence. This language turns mass shootings into natural disasters, as unpredictable and preventable as hurricanes and tornados. Human behavior is unpredictable, but gun violence is not. In Chengping, Henan, China today, a deranged man slashed 22 schoolchildren with a knife. None died. School shootings in America are a product both of mad people and bad laws. As we learn more about the young children killed in Newtown today, we will hear calls not to ""politicize"" their deaths. I urge you to ignore those calls. There is no better way to mourn these senseless deaths than to demand we change our laws and our culture so that the killing of innocent children truly becomes unthinkable. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ethan Zuckerman.","Ethan Zuckerman: Friends react to Newtown shooting with grief, prayers, calls for gun control .

"(CNN) -- The 2014 Tour de France will start in Northern England for the first time, organizers of cycling's most prestigious race announced Friday. The first two stages of the 101st edition of the Tour will take place in the county of Yorkshire, with Leeds the host city of the Grand Depart. The third stage will move south with the finish in London, which successfully hosted the start of the 2007 Tour de France. British riders dominated this year's Tour as Bradley Wiggins recorded a memorable victory with his teammate Chris Froome in second place, while sprinting star Mark Cavendish claimed three stage wins. Wiggins went on to claim the gold medal in the men's time trial at the 2012 London Olympics, as millions crammed the roadside to watch his heroics. Christian Prudhomme, the director of the Tour de France, said this had been a major factor in their decision. ""Since the resounding success of the Grand Depart in London in 2007, we were very keen to return to the United Kingdom, . ""Bradley Wiggins' historic victory last July and the enormous crowds that followed the cycling events in the streets of London during the Olympic Games encouraged us to go back earlier than we had initially planned. ""Yorkshire is a region of outstanding beauty, with breathtaking landscapes whose terrains offer both sprinters and attackers the opportunity to express themselves,"" he added. Yorkshire is the biggest county in England and is the home of three notable former Tour de France riders in Brian Robinson, the first Britain to win a stage of the Tour de France in 1958, Barry Hoban, who won eight stages and Malcolm Elliott, the first British rider to hold the green points jersey in the three-week race. The region is likely to reap an economic benefit from hosting two stages, with an estimated two million people watching the equivalent legs of the 2007 race in the British capital and the southern county of Kent, bringing $141 million in extra revenue, according the the main backer of the start, Transport for London. Gary Verity, chief executive of Welcome to Yorkshire, the agency behind the county's bid, said they were proud to have been selected. ""It will mean less than two years after hosting the Olympics the British public can look forward to another of the world's biggest sporting events coming to the country, "" he said. Since its inception in 1903, the Tour de France has become one of the top global sporting events with millions of fans lining the 3,500km route to cheer on the peloton.","2014 Tour de France will start in Northern England .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The San Diego County medical examiner's office Thursday classified the death of former NFL linebacker Junior Seau as a suicide, but the finding will probably do little to answer questions swirling since he was found with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest. Toxicology results and the narrative that could reveal contributing factors in the death could take weeks or longer to complete, said Sarah Gordon of the medical examiner's office. Since news broke that Seau was found Wednesday in his Oceanside, California, home with a gunshot wound to the chest, there has been speculation about whether repeated hits to his head over his 20-year pro career could be a contributing factor. 1994 Chargers team carries dark legacy . There is no evidence Seau suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative disease brought on by multiple concussions, though friends and family have stepped forward to say the legendary linebacker suffered a number of hits to the head during his career. As a linebacker, he played ""the most havoc-ridden position on the team. He suffered many concussions, so there is a strong sense that it played a role,"" said Shawn Mitchell, a pastor and Seau family friend. Mitchell, who stood next to Seau's grief-stricken mother as she faced a sea of cameras to discuss her son's death, said the family had received calls from researchers asking to study his brain. ""Him taking the shot to the chest makes sense that he would want his head examined,"" he said. The medical examiner's office, in a statement Thursday, said it was awaiting the family's decision regarding study of Seau's brain. It said a final autopsy report may take up to 90 days to complete. The autopsy confirmed Seau died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest. While Mitchell did not identify the researchers making the requests, among the institutions the family could donate Seau's brain to is Boston University's Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy, the research center that found former Chicago Bears safety Dave Duerson suffered degenerative damage to his brain because of repeated hits. Duerson committed suicide, shooting himself in the chest in 2011 and leaving a suicide note that said he wanted his brain studied for possible damage. Seau's death follows last month's suicide of former Atlanta Falcons safety Ray Easterling, the lead plantiff in a class action lawsuit against the NFL over concussion-related injuries. The lawsuit names more than 1,000 professional players. In both cases, Easterling and Duerson exhibited symptoms of repetitive head trauma: memory lapses, anger and deep depression, according to family and friends. And in both cases, researchers found signs of brain trauma. More than 100 former professional football players added their names Thursday to the growing list of people suing the NFL, saying it ""repeatedly refuted the connection between concussions and brain injury,"" according to the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta by attorney Mike McGlamry. The NFL has repeatedly dismissed the allegations, saying player safety is a priority. ""Any allegation that the NFL intentionally sought to mislead players has no merit,"" it said. Seau does not appear to have participated in any of the pending lawsuits against the NFL. CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, warned against drawing a conclusion in Seau's case, though he said there were striking similarities between his death and other cases involving football players. The only way to determine if Seau suffered CTE is to analyze the brain tissue for ""hallmarks of the dementia-like disease,"" Gupta said. ""We can't know, unless Junior Seau's"" brain is analyzed in this way, whether his death was related to CTE, he said. Though Seau had no reported documented history of concussions, Gupta said ""the hits don't necessarily result in diagnosed concussion, but the brain is rattled over and over again."" Seau family friend Joe Gallagher said the former linebacker made a comment recently that appeared to indicate a possible issue. ""Junior had wanted to donate his brain to science to the study of concussive injuries,"" he told CNN affiliate KGTV of San Diego. Seau was drafted into the NFL in the first round in 1990 out of the University of Southern California. He debuted with the San Diego Chargers, establishing his Hall of Fame potential as a Pro Bowl staple. He left San Diego before the 2003 season to join the Miami Dolphins and spent parts of the last four seasons with the New England Patriots before retiring in late 2011. Seau amassed 1,526 tackles, 56.5 sacks and 18 interceptions in his 20-season career. Seau's death rocked the Southern California city of San Diego, where he was a member of the 1994 Chargers -- the team's only Super Bowl appearance. His reputation as a fierce tackler -- with a heart of gold for his community work -- earned him admiration and a legion of fans. Through most of his career he avoided negative publicity that plagued some in the NFL. But in October 2010, he made headlines when he was charged with domestic violence after an incident with his girlfriend, and then hours after his arrest he drove off a cliff and crashed on the beach. Investigators later ruled the crash an accident, saying he fell asleep at the wheel. On Wednesday, Seau made headlines again. His girlfriend, who had just returned home from a workout, found him in the bedroom of his home with a gun lying next to him, authorities said. It is not clear if Seau left a note or an explanation. Funeral arrangements are pending, but are expected to be announced Friday afternoon. ""At that time, any specifics to be shared will be made available to the public, as we are waiting to discover Junior's personal wishes through an Executor,"" Mitchell said in an e-mail. In the hours before his death, Mitchell said he sent text messages to his ex-wife and their three children. ""They said simply, 'I love you,"" Mitchell told CNN. ""They actually responded back to him with 'Love you too, Dad.'"" Alan Duke reported from Los Angeles, and Chelsea J. Carter reported from Atlanta.","NEW: Popular athlete's death classified as a suicide .

"(CNN) -- As President Barack Obama and former Gov. Mitt Romney crisscrossed the country during the final week of the 2012 presidential campaign, few people were able to see the candidates in their most candid and unguarded moments, except for their personal photographers. Several weeks ago, CNN invited each campaign team to submit images from the last week of the race, from Friday, Oct. 26 through Saturday, Nov. 3. Little did anyone know that the last week would be dominated not by last-minute stops in swing states and wall-to-wall speeches to rally the party faithful, but rather one story: Superstorm Sandy. Here are images provided exclusively to CNN by the Romney campaign, displayed in chronological order and shot by photographer Eric Draper. Draper, who served as President George W. Bush's personal photographer and head of the White House Photo Office, joined the Romney campaign this summer.

"(CNN) -- The family of a nurse who apparently hanged herself after taking a prank call regarding Prince William's pregnant wife Catherine spoke movingly Saturday of their grief at losing the ""core of the family"" who had surrounded them with love and laughter. Speaking to reporters outside Westminster Cathedral, where a Mass was held to remember Jacintha Saldanha on Saturday morning, they described the ""unfillable void"" her tragic death had left in their lives. It was the first time her husband, Benedict Barboza, and two teenaged children had spoken publicly of their loss since the nurse's death on 7 December. ""My wife, you were the light of my darkness, who always showed me the way forward,"" said Barboza. Who was nurse Jacintha Saldanha? ""I feel a part of me has been ripped out. Without your beautiful smile and sparkling personality the house is an empty place to live."" The couple had been together for 19 years with a ""strong bond of affection and understanding"" that he would cherish forever, he said. ""Your loss is a very painful one and nobody can take that place in my life ever again. I love you and miss you forever,"" he said, breaking down in tears as he finished speaking. The couple's son, Junal, spoke of his mother as a ""kind, generous and well respected woman,"" who was the core of the family and had instilled the principles in her children that would guide them through life. ""You worked tirelessly to give us everything that we have today,"" he said. Lisha, his younger sister, said they would miss their mother's laughter and the loving memories they share. ""We are shattered and there's an unfillable void in our lives. We love you, Mum. Sleep in peace and please watch over us until we meet again in Heaven. We will always love you and keep you close to our hearts."" Opinion: Prank call pitted 'the great' against the powerless . Saldanha's funeral will be held on Monday in Karnataka, southern India, the family said. The nurse's death, three days after she took the hoax call from two Australian DJs who impersonated Prince Charles and Queen Elizabeth II, shocked people around the world. A memorial fund to benefit her family has been set up by King Edward VII Hospital, where she worked. Saldanha was found hanging from a wardrobe door at her hospital living quarters on December 7, a coroner's court heard Thursday. The court was told she left three notes, but the content of them was not disclosed. Read more: Nurse death sparks outrage, casts glare on 'shock jocks' The details around the circumstances of Saldanha's death emerged as an inquest -- a proceeding usually held in Britain when a death is sudden or unexplained -- was opened. It is due to reconvene in March. Police are looking at e-mails and telephone records, the inquest heard, and will speak to Saldanha's friends and co-workers about what could have led to her death. At this time there are no suspicious circumstances, Detective Chief Inspector James Harman said. Saldanha's death triggered wide public anger against the radio station, Sydney-based 2Day FM, and the two DJS who made the hoax call early on December 4. Believing it was genuine, Saldanha transferred the call to the ward treating Catherine for acute morning sickness, where another nurse gave details of her condition. Friends in her native India have described her as a devout Catholic who was generous, dedicated and caring toward her patients. The hospital released a letter late Friday sent by chief executive John Lofthouse to lawmaker Keith Vaz, who has been supporting the Saldanha family. In it, Lofthouse spells out the guidelines given to staff for dealing with calls when a ""high-profile patient"" is being cared for -- and insists that Saldanha was given full support by the hospital. ""Part of our procedure is to take the name and number of the individual and call them back. This is in order to verify that the call is genuine. We also empower our staff to use their judgement,"" he wrote. ""On this particular occasion, Jacintha believed that the call was genuine, and she felt it appropriate to put the call through. We stand by her judgement."" After the hoax call Saldanha was reassured a number of times by senior managers that she was not being blamed for anything, he said, ""and there were no disciplinary issues involved, because she had been the victim of a cruel trick."" Read more: Australian prank call radio station boss calls nurse's death 'truly tragic' Saldanha was also offered further support, including time off, the chance to return to her family home in Bristol or counseling, but declined to take it, he said. ""Jacintha said that she would prefer to continue working. Neither ourselves, her friends or family noticed anything to give cause for concern."" Lofthouse said he had been in touch with Saldanha's husband and that the family had now accepted the hospital's offer of support. The hospital will do all it can for the family ""at this desperately sad time,"" he added. The media network that owns the 2Day FM, Southern Cross Austereo, has also said it will donate a minimum of 500,000 Australian dollars (US$524,000) to a fund for the nurse's family. Responding to reports of death threats against the DJs involved, Michael Christian and Mel Greig, Southern Cross Austereo said Friday that the safety of its employees was ""an absolute priority."" ""We have sensible measures in place, as we always do, to ensure our people are safe. This is now a matter for the police and we trust they will investigate any specific threats that emerge,"" a spokesman said. The DJs made a heartfelt apology in TV interviews in Australia this week, saying they had meant no harm.

"(CNN) -- Some people might give you the shirt off their back for free. Others might give you their last name -- for a fee. ""I just saw an opportunity -- my mom is going through a divorce and I don't need this last name anymore,"" explained 30-year old entrepreneur Jason Sadler, who lives in Jacksonville, Florida. ""I thought 'How am I going to find a new last name?' well 'Why not just sell it?'"" To many, the idea of selling off the family surname might be crazy. Sadler says he wants to reinvest the money he makes into other ""fun marketing things"" and ""give 10% of it to charity."" The bidding ended December 13 on Sadler's website -- buymylastname.com -- and the winning bidder will pay $45,500 for Sadler to change his name to Jason Headsets.com. For all of 2013, Sadler will legally assume the new surname decided by the winning bidder and will need to change all official forms of identification. The legal process may take several weeks, according to the Florida state courts system, and involves submitting fingerprints for a state and national criminal check, the associated cost for processing, a court date to consider the name change request and a judge's final approval. This is not Sadler's first attempt at a more creative -- if unorthodox -- moneymaking scheme. In 2009, the entrepreneur started wearing the shirts of other companies, serving as a walking ad space for a day. He pulled in more than $66,000 on top of his regular day job that first year. That start-up still operates today at iwearyourshirt.com. Watch: Human advertising in space . Sadler, interviewed earlier in the week by CNN, rejects the idea that he is selling out. ""The reason I say that is that I don't want this last name anymore. The name Sadler doesn't mean anything to me anymore. And for me I want to work with a brand. I live in this kind of online marketing world and I'm very passionate about it. If I said I'll take any casino or pornography site -- that would be selling out."" Sadler set some guidelines before the winning bid. ""I had some legalese written up. If you read the terms and conditions -- nothing political, nothing religious, nothing defaming anybody. There's been a lot of talk on the internet about giving me a dumb last name. It's just not going to happen. I have the last right of refusal."" Beyond 2013, Sadler says he might do it over again and represent someone new or just ""pick a random name from the phone book.""","NEW: Winning bidder pays $45,500 to change surname to ""Headsets.com""

"(CNN) -- Two weeks after being arrested for a shooting he said was in self-defense, a Florida man has been indicted on a charge of first degree murder and three counts of attempted first degree murder. Michael Dunn also faces a charge of shooting or throwing deadly missiles. The indictment came down Thursday in connection with the November 26 shooting that killed 17-year-old Jordan Davis in Jacksonville. Dunn has been held without bond since his arrest. The violence was sparked by a confrontation about loud music at a gas station, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office said. Dunn told authorities that he had asked the teens to turn down the blaring music coming from their vehicle, which was parked next to his as he waited for his girlfriend to return to the car. He heard threats from the teens, Dunn told police, he felt threatened and he thought he saw a gun in the teens' car. He grabbed his gun and fired at least eight shots, authorities said. Davis, among the teens, was killed. No guns were found inside the teens' car, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office said. Some have compared this incident to the Trayvon Martin case, the shooting of an unarmed Florida teen earlier this year that sparked nationwide protests and inflamed public passions over race relations and gun control. Martin's shooting also focused a spotlight on Florida's controversial ""Stand Your Ground"" law, which allows the use of deadly force when a person perceives a threat to safety. Similar to Martin, Davis was 17, unarmed and African-American. Dunn's attorney has rejected such comparisons. CNN's John Branch contributed to this report.","Michael Dunn is indicted on charges of first degree murder .

"(EW.com) -- Warner Bros. has just announced that ""The Hobbit"" earned an estimated $13 million from midnight showings at 3,100 locations last night, giving it a per-theater average of $4,193 from midnight shows alone. It's a nice recovery from the doldrums of the past two frames. When combined, the last two wide releases to hit theaters, ""Playing for Keeps"" and ""Killing Them Softly,"" couldn't earn $13 million over their entire opening weekends. Included in ""The Hobbit's"" midnight figure is $1.6 million earned from 326 IMAX theaters. EW.com: 'The Hobbit' will make a very expected journey to No. 1 . Yesterday, I predicted a $110 million weekend for ""The Hobbit,"" which would make it the fifth-highest opening of 2012 behind the debuts of ""The Avengers"" ($207.4 million), ""The Dark Knight Rises"" ($160.9 million), ""The Hunger Games"" ($152.5 million), and ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn -- Part 2"" ($141.1 million). For reference, here's how each of those films did at midnight: . ""The Avengers"" -- $18.7 million . ""The Hunger Games"" -- $19.7 million . ""The Dark Knight Rises"" -- $30.6 million . ""Breaking Dawn -- Part 2"" -- $30.4 million . EW.com: 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' movie review . Despite the comparatively low midnight gross, I'm expecting ""The Hobbit"" to hold up substantially better than all those films over the full weekend thanks to its increased family appeal (parents aren't taking youngsters to see a three-hour movie at midnight). Encouragingly, ""The Hobbit"" played substantially better than other effects-driven December releases like ""Avatar,"" which started with $3.5 million at midnight on the way to a $77 million weekend in 2009, and ""I Am Legend,"" which started with $1.7 million on the way to $77.2 million in 2007 â€” the current December opening weekend record. Granted, midnight showings weren't nearly as popular even three years ago as they are now, but ""The Hobbit"" will still easily crush those grosses. See the full story at EW.com.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman announced Friday he would resign, a day after the country's Ministry of Justice said he would be charged with breach of trust and fraud. He said in a statement that he must resign from his government position ""in light of the circumstances of the case and details of the indictment."" Liberman maintains he has ""not violated any laws."" His resignation comes five weeks ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for January 22. Immediately following the announcement of the charges, Liberman said he would fight to stay in office. However, less than 24 hours later he had changed his mind after looking over the charges with his attorneys and advisers on campaign law. Liberman is a big player in the current political makeup of Israel and had just formed a coalition with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his party, Likud. But Liberman's statement gave a hint that he may try to settle the case before the snap election is held. ""I am doing this also because I believe that the citizens of Israel are entitled to go to the polls after the matter has been decided on, that is to say, that a legal ruling will be decided on before the elections and this way I will be able to continue to serve the state of Israel and its citizens as part of a strong, united leadership that would tackle the security, diplomatic, and economic challenges facing Israel,"" the statement said. Liberman's party, Yisrael Beiteinu, said he will remain on the ticket and still run in the upcoming elections. The charges of breach of trust and fraud relate to a case dating to 2009. Prosecutors said Liberman pushed to get the Israeli Ambassador to Belarus posted to another country after the diplomat allegedly handed over confidential information that included details of a secret police inquiry pertaining to Liberman. However, Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein said Thursday that Liberman would not face more serious corruption charges including money laundering and witness tampering, because of insufficient evidence. That decision closed a case that has spanned more than a decade and allegedly involved hundreds of millions of dollars transferred through foreign businessmen to companies Liberman owned while he was serving as a Knesset member and minister. He has long denied all the allegations. ""I have always operated according to the law and I have no reason to worry,"" Liberman said last year. Liberman has faced international criticism for his hard-line stance on Israel's Arab minorities. His ultra-nationalist party, the second-largest in the governing coalition, is especially popular with immigrants from the former Soviet Union, where Liberman was born and raised. CNN's Pierre Meilhan and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","NEW: Avigdor Liberman hints that if charges are settled he may return to political arena .

"Lampedusa, Italy (CNN) -- More than 400 people fleeing Libya and Tunisia arrived overnight in an Italian island on Saturday, the latest in a stream of refugees escaping volatile and unstable North Africa. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said the people reached the Mediterranean island of Lampedusa in two boats, one from Libya and the other from Tunisia. The vessel from Libya carried 199 people fleeing the country's civil war, and the other carried 218 Tunisians looking for better lives in Europe. Five boats containing 1,271 passengers reached Lampedusa on Friday. Many of the refugees are from sub-Saharan Africa, including Sierra Leone and Senegal. Others include Bangladeshis and Egyptians. More than 30,000 migrants and refugees from Tunisia and Libya have risked this dangerous journey to Lampedusa since last February. Lampedusa and Malta, both islands less than an hour's flight from the North African coast, have borne the brunt of the subsequent wave of migration. At one point, the population of migrants vastly outnumbered the tiny population of Lampedusa, which numbers less than 6,000. The number of new arrivals from Tunisia has reduced somewhat, thanks in part to a recent agreement with Italy to improve patrolling along the Tunisian coast.","One ship was from Libya and the other was from Tunisia .

"Cananea, Mexico (CNN) -- In a remote town in northern Mexico, a 10-year-old-boy is struggling with his homework. His name is Oscar Castellanos, and the fifth-grader is getting extra help from his father because he's having trouble adjusting to his new school. The student enrolled at Leona Vicario Elementary in the town of Cananea is technically a foreigner in his father's land. Oscar was born in Arizona and is a U.S. citizen. He recites the U.S. Pledge of Allegiance by memory without hesitation. His English accent is that of a boy raised in the American Southwest. Oscar's family moved back to Mexico after the state of Arizona approved some of the toughest immigration laws in the United States. Now they live in Cananea, a mining town of 30,000, about 35 miles south of the U.S.-Mexico border. When asked whether it's been difficult to adjust to life in Mexico, his answer is ""kind of."" Pressed to elaborate, he adds that one of his main challenges is having ""to speak another language."" Opinion: To-do list for Obama and Mexico's new president . Oscar says he misses the abundance of books available to him in U.S. schools. In Mexico, textbooks are free, but finding additional reading material is often a challenge, especially in a provincial town that's a 23-hour drive from Mexico City. Oscar's 6-year-old sister, Angie, also is an American citizen. Just like her brother, she was born in Tucson, the second largest city in Arizona, with a population of just over a half a million people. When asked about the things she misses about the United States, she mentions ""the stores, bigger houses and parks."" The children's parents, Oscar and Maria Castellanos, lived in Arizona for 13 years as undocumented immigrants, doing all kinds of odd jobs to survive and provide for their children. They had managed to buy a house and a car when the law, known as SB1070, was passed in April 2010. The state law originally authorized police to arrest undocumented immigrants without warrant, if there were probable cause to believe that they had committed offenses that could lead to their deportation. It made being in Arizona without immigration or government identification documents a state crime. And it banned unauthorized immigrants from seeking work. The U.S. Supreme Court struck down those provisions in June but let stand a further clause that allows police to check a person's immigration status while enforcing other laws, but by then, the Castellanoses had gone. Maria, 44, says they finally made the decision to return to their country to protect their mental sanity. ""We would feel persecuted and harassed. We felt bad. It was nerve-wracking, especially when we had to go outside to go to work."" For Oscar, 41, the most difficult part was to abandon everything they had worked so long to build. They left their three-bedroom house and sold their Volkswagen Touareg SUV. Five reasons why time may be right for immigration reform . Now they live in a two-bedroom house and drive a Tsuru, an economy Nissan sedan not sold in the United States. ""It was difficult, because we had everything there. We had to leave everything behind and return to Mexico. It was difficult,"" Oscar says. Oscar Castellanos says they endured years of living in fear in the U.S. but also hoped they were building a better life for their children. It's nearly impossible to estimate how many Mexican immigrants went back home after states like Alabama and Georgia also pushed legislation to crack down on illegal immigration, following in Arizona's footsteps. According to the Pew Hispanic Center, net migration from Mexico to the United States fell to zero or less from 2005 to 2010. This means the number of immigrants entering the United States is likely equal or smaller than the number leaving, although, the study adds, some left the U.S. unwillingly: They were deported. In Mexico, Angie Castellanos sings her ABCs in English to her family. She has yet to learn them in Spanish. The Castellanos family is among the fortunate ones. Oscar was able to find a job as a miner just a few months after returning to his hometown in northern Mexico. Maria is managing a restaurant, and both kids are enrolled in school. Maria has been helping Angie with her Spanish while Oscar teaches math to his son. Both parents say they try not to think about what might have been, while the children frequently seem to miss the life they had across the border.

"(CNN) -- ""The X Factor"" fans may be looking forward to next week's finals, when a male country singer, a girl band and a female soloist battle it out for a $5 million record contract. But the end of season two will be another finale of sorts, as judge L.A. Reid announced Thursday he is leaving the show. No, he didn't say he's mad at Simon Cowell. As chairman and CEO of Epic Records, Reid is very busy, according to the label, and he needs to turn his full attention to his job. The third season will launch without him. His replacement is yet to be announced. The song contest show has seen some other turnover this year, with Britney Spears and Demi Lovato replacing first season judges Nicole Scherzinger and Paula Abdul. Two new hosts, Khloe Kardashian Odom and Mario Lopez replaced Steve Jones. ""X Factor,"" which runs on Fox, competes for viewers with similar sing-offs - ""American Idol,"" also on Fox, and ""The Voice,"" on NBC. All three have suffered some ratings dips, according to entertainment industry magazine The Hollywood Reporter. They have since doled out millions to lure new stars to judge and host positions to attract more viewers. Reid appeared to enjoy himself at Thursday's semi-final broadcast, when the country singer he mentored, Tate Stevens, was voted by fans into next week's finals. ""I can't even claim to have been a country music fan, but, you know what, I am now, but more importantly, I am a Tate Stevens fan,"" Reid boisterously exclaimed after embracing the singer in the cowboy hat upon the announcement of his protÃ©gÃ©'s victory. Tate will be joined in ""X Factor"" finals by soloist Carly Rose Sonenclar and girl band Fifth Harmony. Reid had worn a cowboy hat during Wednesday's show to support Tate.

"Cairo (CNN) -- A top aide to Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy blamed a small but powerful minority for the political upheaval that has plagued the country ahead of a planned constitutional referendum. The country will vote Saturday on whether they approve or disapprove of a new constitution recently drafted. The statements are the latest in a volley of accusations between Morsy's supporters and opponents, and they highlight a political crisis that at times has spilled into the streets, prompting the president to deploy troops and tanks to protect government buildings. ""You have the majority of the poor people, the simple, definitely for the president and for the constitution,"" Muhammad Rifaa al-Tahtawi, Morsy's chief of staff, told CNN on Sunday. ""You have a majority among the elite who are not for this constitution. Businessmen, media people. They are definitely a small minority, but powerful minority."" Al-Tahtawi's comments followed calls by the opposition for new, nationwide protests while accusing Morsy of risking a ""violent confrontation"" by moving forward with the scheduled vote Saturday. Read more: What's driving Egypt's unrest? But al-Tahtawi dismissed the threat, saying the issue would be decided by the people. ""If we do not manage to come to terms, let us go to the people,"" he said. Even so, Morsy has authorized the army to help maintain security ahead of the vote, giving it the power to arrest civilians. Al-Tahtawi told CNN the army will work with police to protect voters and government building's during voting. ""It is possible that we'll have problems. But if voters turn out en masse, I don't think there will be any violence,"" he said. Opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Monday that the groups opposing the constitution are still considering their response. ""We will either boycott or vote no,"" he said, calling the entire process illegitimate. Last week, protesters marched almost every day on the presidential palace, which has been the scene of violent clashes pitting thousands of protesters -- for and against Morsy. Egyptian authorities said at least six people have been killed in violent clashes in recent days, while the Muslim Brotherhood -- the group that backs Morsy -- has said eight of its members were killed. More than two dozen Muslim Brotherhood offices, as well as its headquarters in Cairo, have been attacked. The crisis erupted in late November when Morsy issued the edict allowing himself to run the country unchecked until a new constitution was drafted, a move that sat uncomfortably with many Egyptians who said it reminded them of ousted President Hosni Mubarak's rule. Morsy had said the powers were necessary and temporary. Anger about Morsy's move led to protesters reoccupying Tahrir Square, the scene of the Arab Spring uprising that saw Mubarak ousted in 2011. Thousands later protested outside the palace, where the opposition clashed with the Muslim Brotherhood. The anger only grew when the Islamist-dominated Constitutional Assembly pushed through a draft despite the objections of the secular opposition, including some members who walked out in protest. Morsy, who is backed by the Muslim Brotherhood's political party, has refused to delay the referendum, saying a constitution is essential for the fledgling democracy. The opposition, meanwhile, says the document does not represent all Egyptians. The opposition has accused Islamists, predominantly the Muslim Brotherhood, of manipulating the poorer portions of the population, using a fear of God and religion to drive them to vote. In an interview with CNN, al-Tahtawi, who also is backed by the Muslim Brotherhood, disagreed with the opposition's characterization, describing it as ""part of the disease of the elite."" An independent judiciary has backed Morsy, finding that the referendum must be carried out on December 15 to meet a legal requirement. Morsy canceled the edict that gave him virtually unchecked powers over the weekend, though he did not roll back the directives he put in place before it. Among the steps he took was setting the date of the constitutional referendum. A coalition of Egyptian Islamic parties, including the Brotherhood, says it rejects any postponement of the vote. A countering coalition of Morsy's opponents, the National Salvation Front, called for protests Tuesday and Friday. CNN's Reza Sayah reported from Cairo, and Amir Ahmed from Atlanta. CNN's Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- A broken-down freighter and its tow ship finally reached safety in Dutch Harbor, Alaska, on Tuesday afternoon, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. Chief Petty Officer Dana Warr said Monday the disabled Golden Seas and the tow vessel Tor Viking II had to travel about 150 nautical miles (172 miles) despite being just 30 miles south of the harbor as of Monday afternoon. That's because the ships had to pass through a safe shipping lane that required them to travel northeast, then cut back west and ultimately south before entering the harbor, Warr said. The captain of the tug boat decided to take a longer route because of the rough seas, including up to 25- foot waves. The 738-foot Golden Seas was traveling from Vancouver, British Columbia, to the United Arab Emirates when it suffered engine trouble Friday morning off Alaska's remote Aleutian Islands. The vessel was unable to power through rough waves and was in danger of running aground. The ship is carrying canola seed used for making canola oil as well as more than 450,000 gallons of crude oil, 11,700 gallons of diesel fuel and 10,000 gallons of lube oil. It is owned by the Greek company Allseas Marine. According to a situation report released Monday from the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, several islands along the Golden Seas' route to Dutch Harbor ""may be vulnerable to a potential spill,"" but no spill has occurred. The Tor Viking II reached the ship on Saturday and began towing it toward Dutch Harbor. CNN's Rick Martin and Michael Martinez contibuted to this report.","NEW: Disabled cargo ship and tow boat take long route to harbor because of rough seas .

"London (CNN) -- Computer hacker Gary McKinnon will face no charges in the United Kingdom over what the U.S. government says is the biggest military computer hacking of all time, British prosecutors said Friday. The Crown Prosecution Service announcement follows a decision two months ago by Home Secretary Theresa May to block his extradition to the United States to face trial on health grounds. She said then that UK prosecutors must decide if a new criminal case should be opened in England. Read more: UK blocks hacker McKinnon's extradition to U.S. The prosecution service and London's Metropolitan Police said in a joint statement that their decision not to do so reflected the difficulty of trying the case in Britain when most of the evidence and witnesses are in the United States. ""The prospects of a conviction against Mr. McKinnon, which reflects the full extent of his alleged criminality, are not high,"" the statement said. UK authorities believe the United States is the appropriate place for the case to be tried, it said. McKinnon fought a decade-long battle against extradition before May's move to block it in October because of his health. The 46-year-old has Asperger syndrome and depressive illness, as well as schizophrenia and other mental health issues. He has admitted breaking into computers at NASA and the Pentagon, but says he did so to find out if the U.S. government was covering up the existence of UFOs. The U.S. government says McKinnon accessed 97 computers from his home in London for a year starting in March 2001, costing the government about $1 million. He is accused of breaking into military, NASA and civilian networks, and accessing computers at the Pentagon; Fort Benning, Georgia; Fort Meade, Maryland; the Earle Naval Weapons Station in Colts Neck, New Jersey; and the Johnson Space Center in Houston, among others. In one case, McKinnon allegedly crashed computers belonging to the Military District of Washington.","Gary McKinnon will not face a new criminal investigation in England, prosecutors say .

"(CNN) -- Thor Heyerdahl said he had fish practically leaping onto the Kon-Tiki during his cross-Pacific voyage in 1947, but the bounty from the sea hasn't been so rich for the crew of the Plastiki. With only three fish caught to date, they've been relying on their larder for provisions. But it's not a diet of ship's biscuits, limes and rum rations for David de Rothschild and the crew; their galley is complete with meals that would not look out of place at a chic San Francisco restaurant. In keeping with the ethos of the expedition, all the Plastiki's food is sustainably sourced and where possible, organic. From beef bourguignon to lamb ragout and Thai chicken curry, the meals were devised by San Francisco-based foodies Jennifer Tuck and Nona Lim. Tuck and Lim are the gourmands behind Cook!, a home-delivery sustainable food company. ""Our mission is to bring joy and fun back to your kitchen, or in your case, the galley,"" said Lim and Tuck in their specially devised food guide for the Plastiki. ""In sum, these ingredients and meals hold lots of care and intention for the crew."" Keeping the crew buoyant and healthy are hundreds of pounds of fresh kale, cabbage, leeks, beets, chilies and other greens and many fruits. All were dried and packed before setting off. All the meats and meat dishes aboard come from grass-fed, sustainable livestock raised close to San Francisco. The meat was cooked alone or as a stew with very rich stock then placed in hot sterile jars and pressure-cooked to ensure freshness and preservation. The crew have more than 110 of these ready-meals to keep them going through the long journey. The crew might be more familiar with riggings than roulades but Lim and Tuck have a simple message for them when it comes to cooking: ""We encourage you to follow this bit of sage advice from Julia Child: 'Learn how to cook -- try new recipes, learn from your mistakes, be fearless, and above all have fun!'"" Plastiki also is supplied with a nutritional guide for the crew advising them on what to eat and how to build meals that support the periods of high-level activity during the voyage. ""Incorporate protein steadily into all your meals, especially with breakfast. This will help keep your energy stronger and steadier, and help control your blood sugar levels throughout the day as well,"" is a central piece of advice from the guide. Of course the all important rule is all on board is to hydrate well, something the crew discovered toward the end of the first leg of the journey, when water levels on board were so low not enough could be spared to keep the on-board hydroponic garden alive. ""After 20 days at sea we realized we were using more water for the plants than we anticipated and we were slightly concerned about our own water intake,"" David de Rothschild told CNN. ""We took the decision to drink the water ourselves [instead of water the garden]. It was a sad day when the last of our kale wilted but we had a very good spinach omelette and said a fond farewell to it.""","Provisions onboard Plastiki come from sustainable and organic sources .

"(CNN) -- A Michigan attorney on Tuesday refuted a medical examiner's findings about a 7-year-old girl's shooting death, charging a police cover-up in the incident. Attorney Geoffrey Fieger told reporters that he retained Macomb County Medical Examiner Daniel Spitz to conduct his own investigation. Fieger said Spitz's findings were contradictory to the official Wayne County medical examiner's report that the bullet struck the child in the neck. Spitz's report showed that the bullet hit the top of Aiyana Jones' head. It exited through her neck and grazed her chest, Fieger said. He said the report disproves a claim by police that there had been a tussle between officers and the girl's grandmother, Mertilla Jones, inside their house. The grandmother and granddaughter were sleeping on a couch in the front room when the raid occurred. ""Certainly there was no time for a struggle,"" Fieger said. Jones died in the May 16 police raid. Detroit Assistant Police Chief Ralph Godbee has said that preliminary information indicated that officers approached the house with a search warrant for the girl's uncle in connection with the shooting of a high school student last month. Godbee said the officer's gun discharged accidentally inside the home after physical contact with Mertilla Jones. Fieger showed reporters a computer-generated diagram of the shooting, based on Spitz's medical report and a video that Fieger said he has seen. Fieger said it was clear that the gunshot came from outside the home, from the front porch, after police tossed in what's known as a ""flash-bang"" grenade to startle the residents. ""He shot purposely,"" Fieger said of the officer. ""What he was aiming at, I can't tell you. But I can tell you it was not an accident."" Fieger has sued the city on behalf of Jones' family, saying that police need to be held accountable. He held up a pair of child's hightops Tuesday -- black with pink shoelaces. They were Aiyana Jones' ""princess gym shoes."" ""My belief is that this is part of a significant cover-up,"" Fieger said. ""Come forward and tell the truth."" A state police investigation is ongoing.","Attorney Geoffrey Fieger refutes medical examiner's findings in girl's death .

"(CNN) -- Mention Showtime's ""Homeland"" to just about anyone and two things will happen. One, they'll tell you they watch it religiously and two, they won't stop talking about it to you in painstaking detail. To say the show has a cult following is an understatement. The series has over 2 million viewers weekly, won four Emmy awards this year and received seven Golden Globe Nominations just days ago, including Best Drama, Best Actress in a Drama Series, Best Actor in a Drama Series and Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Mini-series, or Television Film. The creator of ""Homeland"" and former co-executive producer of ""24,"" is Alex Gansa. Before the Season 2 finale airs on Sunday, December 16, CNN caught up with Gansa to talk about the writing process, the ""SNL"" spoof and the long wait for Season 3. CNN: You wrote the season finale with Meredith Stiehm -- what is it like in the writers' room? Alex Gansa: We sit around in a room and there is some fun in concocting some stories because we only have to do 12 episodes. The load is less than, for example, ""24"" so you have an opportunity to really focus and to try and really make them better because you are only doing half as much. CNN: How long does it take to write one episode? Gansa: The episodes take different amounts of time. Some are a real bear and they are difficult to break in the story room and they are difficult to idealize on the page and they go through many incarnations. While other episodes just come more easily, where the story lays out in a more cohesive way sooner and they don't take that long. We obviously have time constraints. These things have to get done and they have to get in front of the camera, but in general a story will take about two weeks to break in the story room. And it will take roughly three weeks to write a first draft and then will take about a month after that to really hone into a script that we can put in front of the camera. CNN: It looks like someone dies in the season finale -- what can you tell us about it? Gansa: Rather than corroborate or dismiss any rumors out there, I just encourage people to watch the last installment of the season this year. People have been spoiling episodes and sometimes they are correct but most often they are not. CNN: Did you see the ""Homeland"" sketch on ""SNL?"" Gansa: (laughs) I did! Everybody here just thought it was hysterical. First of all, to be on ""SNL"" means that we are in the national conversation and so it's an honor. People are watching the show and talking about it and talking about Claire (Danes) and Damian (Lewis) and Mandy's (Patinkin) performance and therefore it's easily parodied. But that is just a compliment to what they are doing and I thought they were brilliant. I thought the people that portrayed them were just hysterical and I know that Anne Hathaway and Claire are friends so it was fun. It was well done. CNN: Why do you think people are so addicted to ""Homeland?"" Gansa: That is a very difficult question to answer and it's a question that we are asked all the time. I don't think you can narrow it down to one thing except to say that the show is greater than the sum of its parts. It's one of those amazing instances where everything seems to come together -- the writing and acting and the directing all complement each other and make each other better. But if I did have to narrow it down to one detail or one element, I would say that it is the chemistry between Claire Danes and Damian Lewis on camera. There is something compelling about watching these two damaged people fall in love with each other. CNN: Who would be your dream guest star? Gansa: We kind of already have that dream person. We all loved F. Murray Abraham here and he seems like a perfect character for this clandestine world and a really good antagonist for Mandy's character Saul. So, we already have our dream person in the cast. CNN: Have you gotten any negative feedback or heard from people that didn't like the show? Gansa: You know, we existed in this anonymous little bubble last year for the majority of the season and the show gained an audience and critical acclaim as we went forward. We were just all so shocked and surprised that we won the Emmy so I think there was a bit of a target on our back this year. People were worried whether we were going to live up to the first season. There are some people who don't think the second season is as good as the first. I, frankly, don't agree with them. I'm in the middle of it right now and it's hard to be objective so when this season is over we are going to take a long look at what we did and decide for ourselves. CNN: What can we expect in Season 3? And since people will be going through withdrawals after the finale, when is season three going to air? Gansa: Everyone is going to have to watch the season finale before I start talking the particulars of Season 3 in terms of the narratives and the story, but we will begin filming Season 3 sometime in the third week of May and the show will air in the last week of September 2013. Everyone is going to have to just take a chill pill during our time away.","""Homeland"" creator talks about the writing process .

"(CNN) -- Enough! Enough with putting off tomorrow what we should be talking about today. Enough with being afraid to step on someone's delicate sensibilities when it comes to the Second Amendment. Enough with elected leaders who are too cowardly to confront the National Rifle Association and their ardent supporters. Enough with moms and dads and brothers and sisters and aunts and uncles and pastors and deacons who are afraid to make public the private anguish of mental illness. Enough! Enough! Enough! Enough with just asking for thoughts and prayers. Enough with just hugging our children. Enough with leaving flowers and teddy bears at a makeshift memorial. It's time for action. It's time for people of conscience to, in the words of the late civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer, be ""sick and tired of being sick and tired."" America, 20 of our children are dead, and we are all paralyzed, not knowing what to do or say. I've shed tears for the lives of the innocent children and adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Many of you have likely done the same. Opinion: Mourn, and take action on guns . We witnessed the president of the United States, Barack Obama, stand before the country fighting back tears talking about the lives lost, reminding of us other tragedies involving guns and sick individuals behind the trigger. And every time this happened, those who refuse to discuss gun control are quick to say, ""Now is not the time."" One day after Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher shot and killed his girlfriend, Kasandra Perkins, NBC Sports anchor Bob Costas said it was time to talk about this nation's fascination with guns. Instead of being hailed as an honest communicator, he was vilified for having the audacity to raise the subject at the halftime of a football game. Polls: Your thoughts on gun control . Have we become such a nation of cowards that we are desperate to not discuss a real issue, instead saying, ""Please, shut up so I can watch the game?"" Yet today, we are glued to the television, unable to turn from the scene in Newtown, Connecticut, eager to find every new detail as to what led to the horrific mass murder of a classroom full of kindergartners. Share your thoughts on the shooting . It wasn't time to talk about this when Rep. Gabby Giffords was shot in the head, and six others were killed in January 2011. It wasn't time in July 2012 when 12 people were blown away in a movie theater in Colorado. Seven were killed at a Sikh temple near Milwaukee near August, and we were told then, ""Now is not the time."" So, please, exactly when is the time? This nation, whether we want to admit it not, is one that is fascinated and enraptured with guns. It courses through our veins like heroin shooting through the arms of an addict. We love to see it in our movies, video games, on television, and then we'll fiercely defend the right to bear arms, all while flagrantly waving the U.S. Constitution in the face of anyone who objects. News: Obama remains committed to assault weapons ban, White House . There is absolutely no reason why we need as many guns in America. None. It simply shouldn't be the way of life others are so quick to defend. There is absolutely no doubt that we need tough and stringent gun control. Not solely to prevent murders like those in Connecticut, but to remove the option when someone is angered, depressed or in the case of too many, mentally ill. And that's the second issue that it's time that we come to grips with in this country: We are a nation that has chosen to either medicate or ignore altogether. ""They have a few screws loose."" ""You know he's off his rocker."" We've heard all of the terms. We often laugh and dismiss the mentally ill in America, choosing to cross the street when we see the homeless veteran screaming and cussing at anyone who walks by. When it's time for budget cuts, those most vulnerable often get thrown out first. For years American cities, counties and states have shirked their responsibility when it comes to the mentally ill, choosing to abandon helping them, but quick to build a new prison to incarcerate them when a law is broken. Now we wait to see if the Newtown, Connecticut, killer will be the latest Jared Lee Loughner (Gabby Giffords), Seung-Hui Cho (Virginia Tech), or James Holmes (Colorado movie theater all individuals who were described as mentally unstable. Timeline: School violence in the U.S. Too often the warning signs were there, but ignored for one reason or another. Could any of these tragedies have been prevented? No one knows for sure. But I sure as hell would rather try than have to be a first responder and look a parent in the eye and say, ""Sir or ma'am, I'm sorry. But your baby is dead, killed in the classroom along with 19 other classmates."" See, now is the time that they are having that conversation. Now is the time those parents are grieving the loss of their babies. Now is the time parents in Newtown, Connecticut are eschewing Christmas plans to prepare for a funeral.

"(CNN) -- As political pros, journalists and pundits pick over exit polls to study how and why President Obama beat Mitt Romney for the presidency, a lot of the attention has been showered on the Latino turnout, gender gap and voters under 30. The African-American turnout has largely been overlooked, seen by prognosticators as a no-brainer for President Obama. There was never any doubt he was going to receive the overwhelming majority of black support. In 2008, Obama won 95% of the black vote, with black women voting at a higher rate than any other group in the country. But six to nine months ago, numerous Obama campaign workers were privately expressing concern about the enthusiasm level of black voters, and about whether the massive 2008 turnout could be equaled. Politics: What the election teaches us about ourselves . They hoped registration efforts and get-out-the-vote drives would kick in at the right time. Re-electing the first black president was clearly a motivating factor for African-Americans, but what also should be noted is the Republican Party's efforts to enact voter suppression laws. Not only were black folks angered and shocked at Republicans' blatant attempts at voter suppression in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Virginia, Texas and other states, they exacted revenge at the ballot box. Conservatives have valiantly tried to assert that voter ID laws, trimming the early voting days and even eliminating early voting on Sundays was a prudent and practical decision that had nothing to do with black, Hispanic and young voters, or anyone else. Opinion: The GOP's real problem is ideology . But anyone with half a brain could see that the GOP was desperate to upend the coalition that proved so pivotal to Obama in 2008. All over the country GOP-led legislatures and governors rushed to pass voter ID laws, only to see federal courts reject a number of them that clearly weren't thought through properly. In Ohio, the voter suppression tactics were outrageous. After public pressure mounted to stop the practice of extending early voting in GOP-leaning counties and cutting them in Democratic-leaning counties, Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted had no choice but to equalize early voting periods. Such decisions, frankly, ticked off black activists, politicians, and civil rights groups to the point their voter registration campaigns went into overdrive. I talked to officials in multiple states, and the anger could be heard in their voices. Social media played a role as every new voter suppression effort was exposed, setting off a litany of complaints. Opinion: GOP routed by reality . In Florida, Republicans stopped allowing early voting on the Sunday before Election Day, with no explanation as to why. In 2008, black churches marched a massive number of congregants to the polls, led by their slogan, ""Souls to the Polls."" The GOP clearly didn't want to see that happen again. Obstacles like these rekindled the feeling among many African-Americans of the tactics enacted during the civil rights movement to keep blacks from voting. So pastors, deacons and laymen pushed and prodded their members to cast absentee ballots, and pushed hard for their members to stand in lines that during the early voting period can last as long as eight hours. In Ohio, activists hit the salons, barbershops, recreation centers and churches to rally voters to do their civic duty. Black radio stations were enlisted in the battle to protect the sanctity of the ballot. Opinion: Obama's critics, repudiated at last . Even when the networks were calling the election for President Obama on Tuesday, Florida residents were still standing in line to vote, some places in the rain, doing their part to push back. According to NAACP president and CEO Ben Jealous, the organization registered 432,000 voters, a 350% increase over 2008. The president's reelection wasn't about one group over another being the deciding factor. It was a collection of voters from varied backgrounds that made the difference. But the GOP should recognize and accept that its voter suppression tactics were not only roundly defeated, but were decimated. It was the late civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer who famously said, ""I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired."" Black voters, and others, were sick and tired of the GOP trying to keep their votes from being cast by passing onerous laws, and they responded in an amazing way, matching the historic turnout of 2008, and bringing to life the civil rights anthem, ""Ain't Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Around.""

"Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington (CNN) -- It was the middle of the night in southern Afghanistan's Panjwai district when Haji Naim says he was awakened by the sound of barking dogs and gunshots. Moments later, a man clothed in U.S. military fatigues and a T-shirt burst through the door of Naim's home and opened fire, hitting him in the neck, Naim testified early Saturday at a hearing for an Army soldier accused in a mass killing of Afghan civilians. ""I said 'What are you doing? What are you doing?' Naim told the court at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, near Tacoma, Washington, during a live satellite uplink from a base in Kandahar, Afghanistan. ""He didn't say anything ...He just started shooting."" Afghan anger kept U.S. agents from killing scene . Naim and his two sons were among the survivors of the March 11, 2012, rampage that military prosecutors allege was carried out by Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales. Naim's testimony came amid the fifth day of an evidentiary hearing to determine whether there is enough evidence to support the military's case against Bales, who faces 16 counts of premeditated murder and six counts of attempted murder in the predawn attack. The outcome of the Article 32 hearing will determine whether Bales, 39, is court-martialed, and whether he will face the death penalty. Bales has not entered a plea in the case, though his attorneys have said Bales suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and suffered a traumatic brain injury during a prior deployment to Iraq. Naim's son, 13-year-old Sadiquallah, testified he was awakened by a neighbor screaming that an American was killing people. The teen said he ran to a storeroom, hiding behind the curtain that covered the entrance way. Still, he said, he suffered a wound when he was grazed in the head by a bullet. ""I saw him once,"" Sadiquallah said of the shooter. That was when he entered the compound and ""shot up the family."" Sadiquallah's older brother testified the man was wearing military camouflage pants and a T-shirt, and was carrying a rifle with a flashlight. Stunned friends recall good deeds of suspect . Neither Naim nor his sons identified Bales as the shooter. During testimony late Friday, a relative of some of the victims testified about the discovery of the bodies. Khamal Wazir told the court he found his cousin's mother on the floor, her body beside the door of the family compound. ""She was shot in the head,"" he said. Inside, he found the bodies of other relatives -- each apparently shot in the head -- piled on top of each other and partially burned. The fire was out when he arrived, though smoke lingered in the house. ""Yes, the bodies were burned,"" he told the court. Two Afghan guards at Camp Belambay, a small U.S. outpost near the two villages, laid out a possible timetable for the attacks. One guard told the court he encountered a man who was walking onto the base about 1:30 a.m. and told him to stop. He said the man approached and said, 'How are you?"" in Pashtun and went inside the base. Another guard said he saw an American man leaving the base around 2:30 a.m. The man also greeted him in Pashtun, asking ""How are you?"" Neither guard was able to identify Bales as the shooter.

"Washington (CNN) -- House Democrats vented their frustrations with President Barack Obama's tax proposal at a closed-door meeting Tuesday night, with rank-and-file members slamming the White House for leaving House Democrats out of final negotiations, and agreeing too quickly to a GOP proposal on the estate tax. According to several Democratic members and aides, much of the discussion centered on the addition of the estate tax exemption to the package extending all the Bush-era tax cuts for two years. Democrats are fuming that the administration agreed to exempt inheritances up to $5 million and to set the tax rate at 35%. The estate tax is scheduled to be reinstated at a higher rate of 55% next year, with the exemption up to $1 million. A bill passed the House a year ago that set the threshold for the exemption at $3.5 million and the tax rate at 45%. Pennsylvania Democrat Allyson Schwartz said, ""My sense is people are not happy with this,"" telling reporters that Democrats plan to ""push back at little"" at the White House to try to change the estate tax back to the version that passed the House. Schwartz said if the administration agreed to do that, she could support the package, but she could not predict how many other Democrats would do the same. Liberal Democratic Rep Anthony Weiner of New York called the estate tax provision ""one of the biggest problems, because that was the one we had the most leverage on."" According to a senior House Democratic aide, Democratic Rep Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who represented House Democrats in discussions with the administration and Republicans, said the decision to accept the GOP estate tax proposal was ""an unnecessary giveaway to Kyl."" GOP Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona, who was negotiating for Senate Republicans, sponsored an estate tax bill that is essentially the same as the deal outlined by Obama. About 20 House Democrats lined up at microphones at the evening meeting to complain about the president's proposal. According to the senior Democratic aide, in addition to concerns about the substance of the proposal, equally upsetting to attendees was how ""House Democrats were left out of the process at the end."" The aide added, ""they view it as a trend,"" noting that it started with the president's stimulus package. ""The House always seems to get rolled,"" the aide said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ""didn't really weigh in either way"" during the meeting about how members should vote on the president's plan, according to the aide, ""but she certainly wasn't cheerleading for it."" But Pelosi made it clear Democrats were unhappy, telling reporters outside the meeting, ""I think it's fair to say that there is a certain amount of unease with the proposal that was put forth by the president."" She also noted that the estate tax benefits a much smaller number of families than the middle-class tax cut. The senior Democratic aide conceded that despite the threats to vote against the plan, it's also a reality that the proposal could still pass the House. ""This gets done, but does not get done with a majority of Democratic votes,"" the aide said. Vice President Joe Biden is scheduled to talk to House Democrats Wednesday afternoon. Asked whether Biden could convince Democrats to support the plan, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer quipped, ""You'll have to ask him."" Hoyer didn't directly answer whether he believed House Democrats could make significant changes to the administration's plan, saying, ""I think it's under discussion,"" but he added, ""the majority of the House is still Democratic""","House Democrats at a closed-door meeting vent on Obama's tax proposal .

"(CNN) -- In documents released Friday, prosecutors say the young man accused of gunning down Batman moviegoers had earlier threatened someone at the University of Colorado and been banned from campus. It's unclear who the threatened person was, but prosecutors have said it was a professor at the University of Colorado campus where shooting suspect James Holmes used to take graduate classes. The new trove of documents -- 57 in all -- are heavily redacted. Read the documents here . Holmes, 24, was barred from the university campus for making threats weeks before the July 20 massacre at a midnight screening of ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Twelve people were killed and 58 injured in the attack. Holmes is facing 152 charges, including murder and attempted murder. It's unclear, because the name of the threatened person has been redacted, whether he or she is the psychiatrist who was treating Holmes at the university. The notion that Holmes was blocked from campus is incongruous with the university's statements that he was denied access to non-public portions of the campus because he had withdrawn from classes. Holmes was a Ph.D. candidate studying neuroscience at the Anschutz campus in Aurora, the Denver suburb where the shooting took place. Defense attorneys have rejected the prosecution's assertions that Holmes was barred from campus. Citing statements from the university, the attorneys argue that his access was revoked because that's normal procedure when a student drops their enrollment. The documents also say the defense made a motion to ask the court to sanction prosecutors for making such statements in court. The judge declined to punish the prosecution but warned them against ""making assertions about the defendant which may be contradicted later by the facts."" In an unusual move, the judge will allow the defense team to go against a standing gag order and release a public statement responding to the prosecution's depiction that Holmes was blocked from campus. A call from Holmes? Just nine minutes before he burst into a suburban mall movie theater, Holmes tried to call but failed to reach Dr. Lynne Fenton, prosecutors have said. Last week, a judge ruled that a notebook mailed to Fenton would not be accessible to prosecutors. The court did allow that Holmes' lawyers could look at it. Fenton testified that her contact with Holmes ended June 11. She said she later contacted campus police because she was very concerned about her last meeting with him. She declined to detail what bothered her. In August, public defender Tamara Brady said in court that Holmes called a University of Colorado switchboard nine minutes before he went into the movie theater in Aurora, a suburb of Denver. The number can be used to get in contact with faculty members during off hours, Brady said. Texts from Holmes? The documents also revealed that investigators have obtained text messages Holmes exchanged with someone before the shooting. That person was not named, and the content of the texts were not made public. Police interviewed that person and, with their permission, examined the phone. Police downloaded the complete contents of the phone because, according to the documents, law enforcement didn't have the technical ability to isolate only the relevant text messages involving Holmes. The witness was concerned that contacts and other personal information may be vulnerable, so the defense received a redacted portion of more than 2,000 pages of material from the cell phone. In August, court documents claimed that Holmes ""had conversations with a classmate about wanting to kill people"" months before the shooting. ""The defendant had conversations with a classmate about wanting to kill people in March 2012, and that he would do so when his life was over,"" said the document released in August. No other details were provided about those conversations. Media requested more information . The documents were released because the media has continuously tried to get the court to release more information about movie theater murders. A probable-cause affidavit, a document that typically lays out the details of a case, has not been released. Officials are under a gag order issued by Judge William Sylvester to protect Holmes' rights. CNN's Jim Spellman contributed to this report.","James Holmes is accused killing 12 people in a Colorado movie theater on July 20 .

"(CNN) -- Friday morning, a Connecticut school for young children was turned into a living hell. It had been a place of innocence, a haven where boys and girls learned, laughed and played. Now, it was a place of shock and sorrow, a grisly crime scene. The shooting spree at Sandy Hook Elementary shattered sleepy Newtown and it shattered America's notions of what constitutes a safe place. It happened just days after a gunman shot three people, killing two of them, at an Oregon mall filled with Christmas shoppers. For three days that place also became a crime scene. Earlier this summer, another place, a movie theater in Colorado was also marked a crime scene after a gunman shot 12 people to death at a screening of the newest Batman movie . Timeline: School violence in the U.S. There have been other recent slaughters that have rattled America including one at an Arizona shopping center where people came to meet Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. These are not places of darkness. They are not places where people expect the worst of mankind to surface. ""There really is no safe place. That is just our imagination,"" said Daniela Schreier, a forensic and clinical psychologist at the Chicago School of Professional Psychology.And what is perceived as safe seems to be shrinking after a spate of high-profile crimes. Places like the Newtown school are part of an assumptive world, said psychologist Robin Gurwitch of Duke University Medical Center. They are places where people take their safety for granted. ""Events like the Connecticut school shooting shatter that notion and we are left reeling."" Gurwitch said. ""What we held as our ideal has now been turned upside down."" Even President Barack Obama wiped away tears and paused to collect himself Friday as he spoke of ""beautiful little children"" killed Friday. ""Our hearts,"" he said, ""are broken today. ""We've endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years and each time I learn the news, I react not as a president, but as anybody else would, as a parent,"" Obama said. ""And that was especially true today. I know there's not a parent in America who doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that I do."" Parents: It 'doesn't seem possible' Or feel anxiety over having to send their children back to school on Monday. It's not that violence has not occurred in elementary schools before. In 1989, a 24-year-old drifter aimed his AK-47 and killed five children on an elementary school playground in California. As far back as 1959, a convict exploded a suitcase of dynamite on a school playground in Houston and killed five people, including three children. But the school shootings that have made recent headlines, starting with Columbine in 1999, have mainly occurred at high schools. The fact that the Connecticut shootings, one of the deadliest in U.S. history, involved such young children makes the tragedy that much harder to fathom, Gurwitch said. ""We begin to think: Is it safe to even step outside?"" Gurwitch said. Some people deal with that potentially debilitating thought with denial -- that this sort of thing happens in Connecticut or in Oregon or in Colorado but it can never happen where they are. ""You have to tell yourself that,"" Schreier said. ""Otherwise you will never go to a mall or to a school."" It's already intimidating enough with metal detectors everywhere from airports to libraries. As horrific as the Newtown shootings are, the reality is that most schools in America still are safe, said Howard Kassinove, director of the Institute for the Study and Treatment of Anger and Aggression. It's just that people's perceptions are more easily swayed in this era of instant information. He likened it to a news story about a shark attack. ""What you have is this notion of one person being bitten by a shark in Australia and the news goes around the world and all of a sudden, you think shark bites are prevalent,"" he said. Photos: Shock and horror . Friday's shooting was almost instantly on television: images of horror repeated many times. That is why, perhaps, that some people worry more, Kassinove said. And they become anxious. ""The only thing we can do is to sit down with our children and talk about it, especially with the little ones,"" Schreier said. Talk about this new world we live in. Declan Procaccini, whose daughter attends Sandy Hook Elementary, did just that. ""It was only a week ago we were talking about this type of situation and I said the chances of it happening are one in a zillion at Sandy Hook,"" he said. ""I was wrong about that."" He said he has been doing his best to soothe his children. ""It's funny -- a bomb hit and there is a lot of smoke and it's still here,"" he said. ""I haven't had enough time to really plan, but hopefully by the time they do go back to school, I will have done a good enough job of making them feel as comfortable (as I can)."" His children were already asking him when this might happen again. The game, he said, was changed from this moment on. Opinion: Now is the time to talk guns, mental illness .","Places that were considered safe are turning into crime scenes .
That Friday's shooting happened in an elementary school was especially hard to take .
The Newtown tragedy turned everything upside down, said a psychologist .
Some people cope with this kind of tragedy by thinking it can't happen to them ."
"(CNN) -- Investor Jim Rogers tells CNN to expect choppy investment waters in the years to come. ""I would be very careful. The next couple years we're going to have turmoil and problems in most financial markets,"" Rogers told CNN's Andrew Stevens. ""Don't invest in anything unless you, yourself know about it. Don't listen to some guy you see on TV -- even if it's me,"" added Rogers, who co-founded the Quantum Fund with George Soros. ""You only stay with what you know and if all you know is money in the bank, put the money in the bank."" With worried investors and a re-elected U.S. President, Rogers said he doubts much is set to change as the U.S. Congress faces impasse on the ominous 'fiscal cliff', the December 31 deadline of automatic spending cuts and tax increases that threatens to send the American economy into recession. ""We have the same president, the same Senate, the same House, the same central bank, the same everything. There's not going to be much change. They're all going to fumble around and grapple with it,"" Rogers said, ""But in the end, they're going to make mistakes -- you and I, and everybody else in the world are going to be worse off. The debt is going to go higher, the spending is going to go higher and they are going to make mistakes."" Rogers is a known critic of the U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and his policies of quantitative easing. With the aim to bring down interest rates and the creation of new money, Rogers believes quantitative easing devalues the currency altogether. ""This is not something that's scientific...look it up -- it's historic,"" he said. ""All you have to do is read economics and all you have to do is read history. Eventually your currency becomes less and less attractive to foreigners... there's more currency turmoil.""","Rogers advice: Don't invest in anything unless you, yourself know about it .

"(CNN) -- Sebastián Piñera is a man on a mission. The Chilean President wants to transform his homeland into a developed nation by 2020. It's a big challenge to undertake during a decade that's already been marred by recession and global economic uncertainty. Yet Mr Piñera seems confident. ""We have invested so much that I hope that the next two years will be a time of harvest,"" he told CNN's Richard Quest. ""We will be able to show to the Chilean people that Chile's a country which is absolutely able to defeat poverty, to overcome underdevelopment, and to join the First World."" So how does the President intend to turn his plans into a reality? Chile already has a very pro-business environment, but Piñera wants to open the doors of trade to his country even wider. As one of Chile's richest men, he is no stranger to business and according to Forbes has amassed a fortune of $2.4 billion. He believes his entrepreneurial background leaves him ideally placed to send out a message to the world: Chile is open for business. ""We have realised that we have to be integrated to the world,"" he said. ""We have to compete with the world. And that is why we have free-trade agreements, with the US, with Europe, with China, with India, with Japan, with Korea - you name it. ""I think that's the right path for Chile to become a developed country."" Pinera: U.S. 'printing money' will not solve economic problems . One of the key factors in Piñera's plan to invigorate the Chilean economy is a move towards digital and knowledge based industries. The country's Start-Up Chile initiative began in 2010, and offers high potential global start-ups a $40,000 investment. No equity is ceded and the only requirement is that one member of the team live in Chile for six months. By the end of its first phase in 2014 it will have provided grants to 1,000 companies for a total of $40 million. Its critics claim the project throws money away and doesn't produce any long-term benefits. However, Piñera claims most companies stay long after the initial six month period, creating jobs, mixing with local entrepreneurs and sharing ideas. ""We're importing and bringing to Chile people that have good ideas, entrepreneurship capacity and the ability to start a business here,"" said Piñera. ""What they will teach to our people is very, very valuable. To have a stable economy, to have a stable democracy, and to have a modern government is not enough. We have to build new pillars of development. Education, science and technology, innovation and entrepreneurship, and more equality."" Of course, Chile's future isn't simply reliant on establishing a sustainable domestic economic policy. It's also dependent on exterior influences, and like all free-trade economies it has plenty to worry about. The problems in the eurozone, the fiscal cliff in the United States, and the slowdown in China all loom in the air above the presidential headquarters of La Monda Palace. Yet Piñera remains defiant. He said: ""I am very convinced that in these next two years, we will be able - even though the world will be in the middle of a crisis - to keep moving forward. At good pace, and with very good direction."" As a nation Chile is viewed as one of the most stable and secure countries in South America. It's rich in mineral resources, has low fiscal debt and political stability, and in 2011 its exports grew by 17%. Piñera attributes Chile's integration into global markets to its free trade agreements and believes continuing on that path will propel the country to economic stability in spite of negative global factors. He said: ""We decided to integrate our country with the world. That is why we are part of the APEC, we have a free-trade agreement with the European Community, we will be part of the Trans Pacific Partnership, we are part of the Pacific Alliance. That's key aspects. If you try to only base your development in your local market, that's not enough. However Piñera knows the hardwork also need to come from Chielans themselves. ""You need to trust your people. And for that you need to improve the quality of education. The quality of training and motivate people to do their best,"" he said.","Pinera outlines plans to boost Chilean economy despite global downturn .

"(CNN) -- Alongside his quest to add more Olympic medals to his collection of 16, swimmer Michael Phelps has taken some time outside of the water to dive into his first video game. The 14-time gold medalist has partnered with publisher 505 Games and developer Blitz Games to create the world's first swimming game for Xbox 360's Kinect system. ""Michael Phelps: Push the Limit"" is played without any controllers, allowing players to move their bodies to replicate swimming styles like backstroke, butterfly and breaststroke and virtually swim in competitions around the world. Phelps, who instructs players in the game on how to improve their swimming, also provided voice work and his motion-capture likeness for the game. He worked with the development team throughout the creative process. A life-long gamer, the Baltimore, Maryland, native is focused on training for the London 2012 Olympic Games. But he's also using technology, including the new video game, to help generate awareness for his sport outside of the global spotlight every four years. In this interview for CNN, Phelps talks about gaming, Twitter, and why he's addicted to the mobile game ""Words with Friends."" How often do you play video games? I probably play two or three days a week. It's mostly just sports games like ""FIFA"", ""Tiger Woods"", ""Madden"" and ""NCAA Football."" I've always loved the sporting games. Every now and then we'll play ""Halo"" online, but I just get destroyed every time and it's not really that fun. What was it like for you to get involved in your own video game? It was weird. I still look at the game cover and I'm like, ""Wow."" But it's kind of cool. Growing up a gamer and being able to work on the little things in this game like the different venues and those types of details has been a dream come true. The opportunities that I've had to take the sport to a new level and change it and do things that people haven't seen before has been fun. And now having a game on Xbox Kinect, it's not every day a swimmer has that. It's just exciting and hopefully everybody out there can enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed the creative process of building it and playing it and making it and being a part of everything. When it comes to the motion controls of the Kinect, what did that open up for swimming? Past (swimming) games have just been about hitting the A and B buttons quickly. Kinect allowed us to get gamers up and actually go through the motions to feel like you are swimming. It's cool for me because this game might help people not only get into the sport more, but to also get up and be active. That's something that's very important for not only kids, but everybody out there. How much of a workout can players get from this game? It actually is hard even for me. I did have a challenging time playing it, but once you get in the groove it's not too bad. It is fairly realistic though, and that's one of the things I really wanted to have in this game. It's going to be interesting to see how people like it. I've been getting people sending me messages on Twitter constantly about it. It is a way to get off the couch and get active instead of sitting there with the controller and just tapping buttons. It's much more interactive than regular games are. Can people learn about swimming from playing the game? Yeah, I'm sure. The better form you have, the faster you're going to go. It's extremely realistic. I found a lot of people were afraid to put their face under the water. So if they actually feel comfortable being able to just swim the strokes, maybe they'll feel comfortable when they get in the water. There are a lot of things that could happen and hopefully we can get more people in the pool and around the pool. What's your favorite piece of technology that you can't live without? I'm always on my phone. I'm always on Twitter. I'm constantly on my BlackBerry and iPhone. I think the apps and everything on iPhones are just unbelievable. Do you have a favorite app that you play around with? I have not been able to stop playing ""Words with Friends."" Ever since I got it, I've been playing it constantly. I can't even invite any more people to play because I'm at the max amount of games you can have. I have 30 games going at once. I'm literally on it non-stop. I took the train up yesterday and that's all I was doing. I had my headphones on and I was playing ""Words with Friends."" So it kills time. It's fun, and it's competitive. What are your thoughts about how far games have come on smartphones? It's unbelievable. You can do anything from your phone. I never thought that I would switch from BlackBerry to the iPhone, but gradually I'm taking myself away from the BlackBerry and going to the iPhone and it really is amazing. You can get anything from directions to restaurants to games. You name it. Like the commercial says, there's an app for that. How does technology allow you to connect with your fans, especially during the off Olympic years? That's been one of the cool things. I said I would never get on Twitter. And I stayed away from it until last December and (since then) I literally haven't put it down. It's a cool way to connect with people all over the world. There have been fans from China and Brazil and everywhere who are constantly tweeting at me or asking things. People ask me about the video game or about how I'm training. It's been fun to keep everybody in the loop of what's going on. What are you looking forward to with the next Olympics? I think the biggest thing is just trying to prepare myself the best way I can. Over the years I probably haven't been in the best shape, but I'm in better shape now than I was in '09 or '10 and this past summer. Hopefully in the next ten months I can get in even better shape and just try and accomplish the goals that I have. I have a lot of goals that I want to accomplish in and out of the water before I retire. If I'm able to do that, then I can look back on my career and say it's been a success. Can you share any of the goals? My coach and I are the only two that know. Throughout my career I've always sort of kept them between him and I, and we're the only two that are really going to be able to help each other get to the goals that we have. We work well together. We're more relaxed now than we ever have been and we're having fun, so who knows what can happen? The sky is the limit. We have a lot to do and the Olympics will be here before we know it.","""Michael Phelps: Push the Limit"" is the first swimming game designed for Kinect .

"(CNN) -- For one private collector, it's the beginning of a beautiful friendship. A buyer has purchased the piano used in one of the most beloved scenes in all of film: the playing of ""As Time Goes By"" in ""Casablanca"" -- the 1942 classic movie starring Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. Sotheby's New York auctioned the piano for $602,500 on Friday, a sale price lower than expected. The estimated price for the piano had been $800,000 to $1.2 million. The 58-key piano is a memorable part of the romantic flashback sequence in Paris at La Belle Aurore, where Rick (Bogart) and Ilsa (Bergman) listen to Sam (Dooley Wilson) sing and play ""As Time Goes By."" The piano is distinctive for its diminutive size and distinct hue. ""Seeing the piano in real life you end up with a couple of things,"" said David Redden, vice chairman at Sotheby's. ""It's quite colorful, green and distressed yellow. And you don't realize how small it is, so small in fact Bogart and Bergman sort of tower over it."" Redden is no stranger to this famous Hollywood prop. He first auctioned it off back in 1988. ""It was sold to a Japanese man and now it's come back to us,"" Redden told CNN. ""He paid $154,000 for it."" On Friday, a pianist played ""As Time Goes By"" in the Sotheby's salesroom ""before the piano was spun around on the turnstile to an awaiting audience and bought by a private collector,"" the auction house said. The sale was greeted by applause, Sotheby's said. The instrument had no significant value in the golden age of moviemaking, Redden added. ""It would be re-used again and again,"" he said. Many critics and movie-lovers regard ""Casablanca"" as one of the greatest films ever made. Directed by Michael Curtiz, it won three Oscars, and is replete with memorable lines and scenes. ""The piano is a star of the film,"" Redden said. ""The music is so emotive, so moving and the piano really becomes a symbol of the love story between Bogart and Bergman."" Wilson, the actor who portrayed Sam, was a trumpeter, not a pianist, according to Redden. ""He is sort of miming the fingering. But someone else is playing nearby and he was following the real player,"" Redden said. Now, the unknown new owner -- just a ""citizen of the world,"" like the character Rick -- gets to tickle the ivories as time goes by.","The piano was used in a famous scene from the 1942 film ""Casablanca""

"(CNN) -- The Australian radio station which made a prank call to a UK hospital that apparently resulted in the death of a nurse said Tuesday that it would donate at least 500,000 Australian dollars (US$524,000) to a fund for the nurse's family. Jacintha Saldanha apparently committed suicide after being duped by the prank call from two DJs seeking information on Prince William's pregnant wife, Catherine. Read more: Radio personalities apologize for prank call . The Sydney-based 2DayFM radio station has come under heavy fire over the hoax call. The media group which owns 2DayFM said it would resume advertising on the station -- halted in the wake of the tragedy -- beginning Thursday, with all profits until the end of the year going to ""an appropriate fund"" that would directly benefit Saldanha's family and a minimum contribution of 500,000 Australian dollars. ""We are very sorry for what has happened,"" said Rhys Holleran, chief executive of Southern Cross Austereo. ""We hope that by contributing to a memorial fund we can help to provide the Saldanha family with the support they need at this very difficult time."" Saldanha put through a call from the DJs to a nurse on the ward at King Edward VII's Hospital, where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated for acute morning sickness early last Tuesday. Opinion: 'The great' vs. the powerless . The 46-year-old nurse was found dead three days later in living quarters in central London provided by her workplace. She left a husband and two children. An autopsy will be carried out Tuesday in Westminster, London's Metropolitan Police said. The hospital has said that it is also collecting donations from the public for the family and asked that checks be made out to King Edward VII's Hospital -- Jacintha Saldanha Memorial Fund and mailed to Finance, King Edward VII's Hospital, 10 Beaumont Street, London. W1G 6AA. ""She was an outstanding nurse whose loss has shocked and saddened everyone at the hospital,"" said chairman Lord Glenarthur. ""Following discussions with her family, we have now established the Jacintha Saldanha Memorial Fund in her memory."" Many donations have already been made from around the world, he said, and the hospital would ""certainly welcome"" a contribution from Southern Cross Austereo. There has been a fierce public backlash against the radio station, both within Australia and worldwide, since its decision to broadcast the pre-recorded prank call. The two DJs, who impersonated Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles in the call, made tearful apologies on Monday for what had happened. Mel Greig and Michael Christian, both crying at times, told two Australian television shows that their thoughts were with Saldanha's family. ""I'm very sorry and saddened for the family, and I can't imagine what they've been going through,"" Greig said on the program ""Today Tonight."" Christian described himself as ""gutted, shattered and heartbroken."" Read more: Nurse death sparks outrage, casts glare on 'shock jocks' ""For the part we played, we're incredibly sorry,"" Christian said on ""Today Tonight."" Both have said that they never expected the call to go through. They also stressed Monday that while they made the call to the hospital, they did not have a say on whether it went to air. The call was recorded and then went through a vetting process at their network before it was broadcast, they said. Share prices for Southern Cross Media Group dropped by as much as 8% Monday following the controversy, according to Australian media reports. A number of big advertisers pulled their spots from 2DayFM before it took the decision temporarily not to run ads. Profits for the media group as a whole were 95 million Australian dollars in the year to June 2012, up from 64.1 million a year earlier, according to the company's 2012 annual report. It was the first full-year earnings report since Southern Cross Media and Austereo Group merged in May 2011. Holleran last week said he was ""deeply saddened"" by the nurse's death but defended the legality of the station's action, saying he was ""very confident that we haven't done anything illegal."" The Australian Communications and Media Authority, the country's media regulator, has said it will be ""engaging with"" the network ""around the facts and issues surrounding the prank call."" London's Metropolitan Police have contacted Australian authorities in relation to the call, but ""are not discussing about what or with who"" they're talking, a spokesman told CNN. A spokeswoman for New South Wales Police in Australia told CNN: ""As the investigation into the death of London nurse Jacintha Saldhana continues, New South Wales Police will be providing London's Metropolitan Police with whatever assistance they require.""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A man accused of planning to attack Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall during their week-long trip to New Zealand was released on bail Tuesday. Sam Bracanov pleaded not guilty at a hearing at the Auckland District Court and was ordered to re-appear on November 27, said Brian Reid, the court's criminal case flow manager. The 74-year old man, a known anti-Royalist, was arrested in Auckland on Monday at one of the venues Charles and Camilla were due to visit during their tour, according to a statement from the New Zealand Police. Neither of the British royal family members were in the vicinity at the time, the statement added. Bracanov was charged with preparing to commit a crime, namely assault, against the royal couple, according to police. Bracanov had planned to throw a bucket of horse manure at Prince Charles, the New Zealand Herald reported. As part of the bail conditions, the court ordered him to stay more than 500 meters (1,640 feet) away from the royal couple, according to the paper. Bracanov said he had been in jail seven times for incidents involving members of the royal family and was not bothered by the order to stay away from them. ""I won't do it [again this week], I've done it once. I was not successful but there's always next time,'' he was quoted as saying.

"Clay, Alabama (CNN) -- Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley on Tuesday toured communities hit by a tornado that destroyed or damaged hundreds of homes and killed two people. ""I do not understand, except by God's grace, that people can survive some of the damage that I see in some of the residential areas,"" Bentley said. The National Weather Service confirmed at least three tornadoes touched down in Alabama early Monday. Two were detected in north central Tuscaloosa County, while the third hit near the town of Clay in Jefferson County, packing winds estimated at 150 miles per hour. The storm destroyed at least 211 homes and seriously damaged another 218 in Jefferson County alone, according to the Alabama Red Cross. The severe weather obliterated the three-story home of Darrell Heichelbech, his wife and two children. Daughter Christina Heichelbech, 16, was one of two killed in the storm. ""She had just such spirit, such life ... She was the kind of kid you wanted to have,"" her father told CNN, barely able to speak through tears. ""All her plans were coming into play, and now they're gone. I don't know what to do."" The girl's family found her about 40 feet from the house, he told The Birmingham News. She was still on her mattress. ""She just looked like she was sleeping like a baby,"" the newspaper quoted the father as saying. ""But she wasn't sleeping. She was gone."" Heichelbech said the storm woke him up, and he called for his family to get downstairs, according to the newspaper. But he said the storm hit as soon as his 13-year-old son emerged from his room. ""I grabbed a hold of his legs and held on as hard as I could,"" the newspaper quoted him as saying. ""I felt wind, but no movement. It was a blink of an eye. There's no question in my mind we took a direct hit."" Authorities said the storm also killed Bobby Sims, 83, a resident of Oak Grove, a community west of Birmingham. At least seven Alabama counties reported damage from the storm, with the majority in Jefferson and Chilton counties, the governor's office said. Bentley pledged ""whatever resources we have available"" to take care of victims. In Jefferson County, five schools remained closed Tuesday, including one that will have to be torn down. Center Point Elementary was 80% destroyed, district spokeswoman Nez Calhoun said. ""It's like Mother Nature has a mean way of doing things,"" Calhoun said. ""This building was only six or seven years old. We added 22 classrooms for growth."" The storm comes less than nine months after a tornado outbreak killed 243 people across Alabama, including 61 in Birmingham and Tuscaloosa. ""The one thing that we can say is thank goodness we're not looking at what happened in this state last year in April,"" Art Faulkner, director of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency, said Monday.

"Washington (CNN) -- Drivers and passengers in the 21st century have heeded the call to ""buckle up."" That famous admonition became a widely used catchphrase in the second half of the 1900s when seat belts became mandatory in cars. Then came the national campaign to ""Click it or Ticket."" Now the overwhelming majority of people are using the safety straps in record numbers. Seat belt use in 2012 reached a high of 86%, up 2 percentage points from a year earlier. That's encouraging news for the projected 39.1 million people who will be traveling this Thanksgiving holiday on the nation's highways. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's annual survey, seat belt use has steadily increased since 1994, coinciding with a decline in the percentage of unrestrained daytime passenger vehicle fatalities. Some of the most significant improvements occurred in the South, where seat belt use rose from 80% in 2011 to 85% this year. The West has the highest percentage of users with 94%. Seat belt use continues to be higher in states that have primary belt laws that allow law enforcement officers to issue citations to motorists, the safety agency said. It points out that 32 states and the District of Columbia have passed primary laws requiring seat belt use. Another 17 states have weaker ""secondary"" laws, under which motorists can be cited for seat belt use only if they have been pulled over for another violation. ""New Hampshire is the only state that has not enacted either a primary or secondary seat belt law, though the state's primary child passenger safety law applies to all drivers and passengers under the age of 18,"" according to the safety agency. ""When it comes to driving safely, one of the most effective ways to protect yourself and your family is to use a seat belt,"" Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in a statement released along with the annual report. ""This Thanksgiving holiday, we're urging everyone on our roadways to buckle up -- every trip, every time."" As part of the survey's complex statistical methodology, observers look for seat belt use on randomly selected roads. Observations are made either while standing at the roadside or, in the case of expressways, while riding in a vehicle in traffic.","Seat belt use in 2012 reached a high of 86%, the government's annual survey shows .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Fourteen people were killed and another 60 were injured in Indonesia over a four-day period as a result of Cyclone Iggy, according to the country's National Disaster Management Agency. Most of those who died were struck by falling trees or debris from strong winds, said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. More than 2,000 homes were also damaged in 35 towns or cities in Java and Bali between Wednesday and Sunday, he said. The government has provided food and aid to the areas affected, the agency said. As of Sunday, Iggy was off the northwestern coast of Australia, said Tom Sater, meteorologist for CNN International. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology issued a cyclone warning for the coastal area from Onslow to Coral Bay, including Exmouth. Iggy is currently classified as a Category 1 cyclone and is near stationary, according to the warning. Iggy is forecast to stay offshore and avoid the coast of Western Australia, said Sater. The effects of Iggy, however, may create high sea conditions, he said. In anticipation of the storm, Australia has shut down some of its coastal oil operations, according to Sater. Iggy is ""expected to continue to move very slowly overnight before taking a more southwesterly track during Monday,"" the Australian Bureau of Meteorology said in a Sunday advisory. CNN's Kathy Quiano contributed to this report.","60 people have been injured, Indonesia's disaster management agency says .

"(CNN) -- Cathay Pacific's flight attendants union voted in favor of taking industrial action Monday after salary negotiations with the Hong-Kong-based airline stalled. The union is considering action that would result in flight delays or reduced onboard services, although its members will not go on an all-out strike over the Christmas period, said its general secretary, Tsang Kwok-fung. Tsang said members are considering work-to-rule action, which means strictly following all rules and procedures to the letter to delay flights. It may also resort to a ""safety-first limited service,"" which means fulfilling only the most basic duties required by the Civil Aviation Department. ""The basic role of a flight attendant is to take care of safety measures on flights and to take passengers from one point to another point safely,"" Tsang said, adding that serving food and beverages were extra services required by the airline. Under this scenario, Tsang said flight attendants would likely provide water to passengers, but refrain from non-essential items such as nuts and alcohol. They would also refuse to provide service with a smile. The FAU would not consider launching a strike until January 1, Tsang said on Thursday. The dispute was sparked by the 2% salary increase for 2013 announced by the airline on November 30. The union had requested an increase of 5%, the same rate they had settled for in 2012. In a press statement, the company said the 2% increase ""took into account a number of factors including a loss of more than HK$900 million in the first half of this year and the extremely difficult operating environment we are in."" But Tsang said the 2% offered for 2013 was unreasonable, adding that it was the same rate offered during severe external crises, such as SARS and the worldwide financial crisis. The airline said it was willing to meet with the union if it withdrew its threat of industrial action. It has ""comprehensive contingency plans"" for any industrial actions the union might take, Cathay Pacific spokesperson Elin Wong confirmed, but she declined to provide details. The union has 6,000 members, representing two thirds of the airline's cabin crew. It last launched a strike for 17 days in 1993 over Chinese New Year.","Cathay Pacific's flight attendants union voted to take industrial action after failed salary negotiations .

"(CNN) -- Last weekend's setback is looking like a mere blip for Juventus. Denied a 50th successive league match undefeated, the Italian champions bounced back with a 4-0 romp against Nordsjaelland in European competition and on Saturday crushed Pescara 6-1 to move four points clear in Serie A. Inter Milan had closed the gap to one with that 3-1 win seven days ago, but the pressure is back on for Sunday's trip to mid-table Atalanta. Juve striker Fabio Quagliarella followed up his midweek goal against the Danish side with a hat-trick, while Sebastian Giovinco was also again on target. Arturo Vidal, who scored against both Inter and Nordsjaelland, opened proceedings to score for his fourth successive match while Kwadwo Asamoah netted an overhead kick in a first half that featured six goals -- one of them to Pescara's Emmanuel Cascione. In Saturday's other Serie A match, Catania moved up to seventh after a 0-0 draw at 10th-placed Cagliari. Bayern Munich stayed seven points clear in the German Bundesliga following Saturday's 2-0 win at home to third-placed Eintracht Frankfurt. France star Franck Ribery netted the opener just before halftime and Austria midfielder David Alaba added a penalty as the Bavarian side followed up the midweek Champions League thrashing of Lille. Schalke stayed second after a 2-1 win over Werder Bremen, while two-time defending champions Borussia Dortmund won 3-1 at Augsburg to remain fourth as Poland striker Robert Lewandowski netted twice. In Spain, Malaga missed the chance to move above third-placed Real Madrid, losing 2-1 at home to Real Sociedad. The Andalucian side qualified for the last 16 of the Champions league in midweek, but twice went behind against a team that had been hovering above the relegation zone before Saturday's game. Real Zaragoza beat Deportivo La Coruna 5-3, sealed by two late goals from Portugal forward Helder Postiga, to leave the visitors third from bottom. Celta Vigo remained above Deportivo on goal difference alone after a 3-2 defeat at Rayo Vallecano that pushed the home side up to seventh. Osasuna stayed at the foot of the table despite winning 3-0 at second-bottom Espanyol. Spanish leaders Barcelona travel to Mallorca on Sunday, while Real Madrid visit levante and second-placed city rivals Atletico host Getafe.","Fabio Quagliarella scores hat-trick as Juventus move four points clear in Italy .

"(CNN) -- ""Beauty"" seemed somehow insufficient a description for the sounds that came from Ravi Shankar's sitar in a concert hall. It was as if nature itself were being replicated on the stage, whether it was gentle summer rain or late-autumn wind having its way with the landscape. There would be intense engagement between Shankar and his ensemble as they summoned into being tempests of interlocking phrases that seemed to coil and unravel at will. The audience would be enraptured, transported, energized into enthusiastic applause. And this was before the actual performance started. ""If you enjoyed the tuning up that much, I hope you enjoy the music even more,"" Shankar can be heard saying on the recording of the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh addressing the appreciative, if nonplussed crowd at Madison Square Garden. It wasn't the first, or last time he gently (at times, not so gently) reproved audiences who, even with the benefit of his warnings, took the preliminaries for the actual recitals. Some learned, some never did -- and then there were those who really did enjoy the tuning-up as much as what followed. Whatever his audience's reaction, Shankar, who died Tuesday at age 92 after undergoing heart surgery, seemed to accept it all with benign imperiousness and regal warmth. As emissary for a classical tradition of Indian music, Shankar was winning over global audiences for that music in greater numbers than could have been imagined when he started learning the music of raga almost 70 years ago. He was already close to legendary stature in India by the 1950s as sitar virtuoso, composer, conductor and director of All India Radio in New Delhi. He had also written scores for several Indian films, notably Satyajit Ray's ""Apu Trilogy"" (1955-1959) whose international acclaim was a huge factor in increasing Shankar's worldwide profile. By the late 1950s, Shankar was making cross-genre connections with the likes of violinist Yehudi Menuhin and jazz saxophonist John Coltrane, whose seminal 1961 recording of ""My Favorite Things"" was infused with modal inventions that carried the incantatory fervor of classic raga music. (Coltrane would name his son Ravi after Shankar. This year, by the way, Ravi Coltrane, who like his father plays tenor and soprano saxophone, released his finest album to date, ""Spirit Fiction"" on Blue Note Records.) As all this indicates, Shankar was already well-known before the Beatles got involved. In fact, they weren't even the first rock group to get hip to Shankar. That honor belonged to the Byrds, who recorded in the same World Pacific Records studios as Shankar did for producer Richard Bock. They in turn got George Harrison hooked on raga and Harrison began plucking the sitar on his own. (Dial up ""Norwegian Wood"" from the Beatles' 1965 album ""Rubber Soul"" and you'll hear that instrument poking out the theme.) Harrison and Shankar met the next year and the ""quiet Beatle"" went to India to study sitar with the master. Back then, whatever the Beatles were interested in, the rest of the world was interested in, too. Brian Jones picked up the sitar on the Rolling Stones' 1966 hit ""Paint It Black"" and the Byrds appropriated a sitar-sound (and a Coltrane riff) that same year for ""Eight Miles High."" ""Raga-rock"" lasted just long enough to make the sitar part of the shorthand soundtrack of what's often derisively labeled ""the hippie era."" Shankar was at best ambivalent about such associations. But his reputation, as with his music, transcended fashion to become its own singular, lasting presence in the world's cultural firmament. Anyone who can make a sound check sound like genius packs substantial weight with the rest of the immortals. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gene Seymour.","Gene Seymour: Ravi Shankar brought classical Indian music to a global audience .

"(CNN) -- The space shuttle Endeavour landed Thursday at Edwards Air Force Base in California, the latest stage in its transcontinental voyage to retirement. The orbiter's final destination is the California Science Center in Los Angeles, but it still has some sightseeing to do before it goes on display. On Friday, Endeavour, atop a modified jumbo jet, will do several flyovers in Sacramento, San Francisco and Los Angeles -- weather permitting. Upon arrival at Los Angeles International Airport, the orbiter will be removed from its perch aboard the Boeing 747 it has piggybacked for three days. NASA said the shuttle will be moved over roads on October 12-13 to its final spot at the science museum. On Thursday, it flew low over Tuscon, Arizona, where Mark Kelly, who was the commander on the last Endeavour mission, watched with his wife, former congresswoman Gabby Giffords. Kelly, who was in space when Giffords was shot and six others were killed in January 2011, said it was emotional to see the orbiter again. ""The space shuttle is really a testament to American engineering and ingenuity,"" he told CNN affiliate KOLD. ""It is the most amazing spacecraft ever built, by far."" His wife had watched the launch of his mission but missed the landing, so it was great for her to see the shuttle in the air, he added. Endeavour, along with Discovery, Enterprise and Atlantis, became a museum piece after NASA ended its 30-year shuttle program in July 2011. Two other shuttles -- Challenger and Columbia -- were destroyed in accidents that killed all aboard. Challenger exploded shortly after launch in 1986, and Columbia broke apart upon re-entry into Earth's atmosphere in 2003. Watch: Trees removed to make way for Endeavour . Endeavour's three-day piggyback flight was divided into three legs that could be described as scenic routes to showcase the shuttle to the public. ""Social media users are encouraged to share their Endeavour sightings using the hashtags #spottheshuttle and #OV105, Endeavour's orbiter vehicle designation,"" NASA said. Wednesday's leg took Endeavour to Houston, with flyovers along Florida's Space Coast, Stennis Space Center in Mississippi and the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. As Endeavour bid farewell to Kennedy Space Center, it elicited strong emotions from people -- such as CNN iReporter Randy Lathrop of Cocoa, Florida -- who have lived with the shuttle program nearby for decades. ""It's the last time that she'll ever be at her home base again. It strikes a chord of nostalgia in you because she's done so many flights from the space center. This is her home,"" Lathrop said. A short history of Endeavour . Named for the first ship commanded by British explorer James Cook, Endeavour rolled off the assembly plant in Palmdale, California, in 1991 at a cost of $1.7 billion. It was the baby of the shuttle fleet, built as a replacement for Challenger. Over the next 20 years, Endeavour flew some of the most high-profile shuttle missions, covering 25 flights and nearly 123 million miles. It flew a Spacelab mission and numerous International Space Station assembly missions and rendezvoused with Russia's Mir Space Station. Read more space and science news on CNN's Light Years blog .

"(CNN) -- The last month has seen a blizzard of new sex abuse accusations against the Catholic Church from across the United States. Almost all of them -- and the intense media attention they've garnered -- can be traced to one man: a Minnesota lawyer named Jeff Anderson. Last week, an alleged victim of priest abuse in Wisconsin announced a lawsuit against the Vatican itself. Anderson is representing the alleged victim. A couple of days earlier, a Mexican man who alleged abuse by a priest years ago filed suit against Mexico's top Catholic cleric in a U.S. court. The plaintiff is another Anderson client. And throughout April, new documents have come to light suggesting that the current pope may have played down warnings about abusive priests in the United States. Those documents came from Anderson's St. Paul, Minnesota, office. For decades, Anderson has won settlements from Catholic archdioceses across the country for abuse victims and, more than any other attorney in the country, has driven American media coverage of the church abuse scandal. Now, with the church abuse crisis embroiling Europe for the first time and raising questions about whether the pope himself did enough to respond to church abuse, Anderson is employing novel legal tactics in an attempt to take his campaign all the way to the Vatican. ""I'm getting far more aggressive because all roads are leading to Rome,"" Anderson, 62, said last Thursday, after filing suit against the Vatican on behalf of the alleged Wisconsin abuse victim. ""I'm pessimistic that the Vatican is capable of changing itself but I'm optimistic that external pressure will,"" Anderson said. ""We're at a tipping point."" Anderson's last sex abuse suit against the Vatican, filed in 2002, has wound its way through the courts, with the U.S. Supreme Court now considering whether to hear the case. But Anderson's critics say that last week's suit against the Vatican, along with much of his other work, is aimed more at attracting publicity than getting justice. ""Anderson has sued the Vatican many times, and has never won,"" said Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights. ""He knows he will lose again this time, but that means nothing to him. What this is all about is grandstanding: getting more PR for himself and throwing more mud at the Catholic Church."" Anderson's firm -- Jeff Anderson & Associates, which employs four other lawyers -- has filed hundreds of sex abuse suits against the church. Though he won't disclose how much he has won in settlements, Anderson is thought to be responsible for a good chunk of the roughly $2.5 billion that, according to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the U.S. Catholic Church has paid to sex abuse victims to date. He was among the lawyers representing abuse victims in the $600 million settlement with the Archdiocese of Los Angeles in 2007, the church's largest payout ever. The settlements started out much smaller. When Anderson filed his first church lawsuit on behalf of a Minnesota plaintiff who in 1983 alleged priest sexual abuse, he was one of the only lawyers in the country taking on such cases. He says the abuse suit -- which targeted the archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis and the diocese of Winona, Minnesota -- was the first against an American Catholic diocese. Anderson says he won a $1 million plus settlement for his client. But his proudest moment in the case was convincing his client to resist signing a confidentially agreement so that he could go public with his story. ""As a result, dozens of other kids abused by that priest broke their silence,"" Anderson said. That knack for getting clients to publicize their stories of priestly abuse -- largely through the news media -- and spurring other victims to break their silence has been an Anderson trademark ever since. In the early 1990s, Anderson represented victims of abuse by Rev. James R. Porter, a Massachusetts priest whose taped comments about having molested ""from 50 to 100 (children),"" made him one of the first abusive priests to earn national headlines. The media attention brought Anderson more business. ""I remember reading a newspaper story about a priest that had molested a bunch of kids and it was the first written statement I'd seen about being sexually abused by a priest,"" said Bob Schwiderski, a former client of Anderson's. ""It was an a-ha moment. I said, 'my God -- I'm not the only one.' And the article mentioned Jeff's firm."" By that time, Anderson had shifted from his initial focus on civil rights and poverty law to take on abuse cases full time. ""That's what sustains me -- the connection with the survivors and their families,"" he said. ""Initially it's their pain, and then it's their strength. They're giving me a lot more than I'm giving them."" Even some of Anderson's opponents see him more as a true believer than a church-obsessed variation of a lawyerly ambulance chaser. ""Jeff is not just after money,"" said Jeffrey Lena, a U.S.-based lawyer for the Vatican. ""He has enough to buy his own island if he wants. (But) what he is doing in these cases is part of his conception of himself. People figure out in life that there was something they really want to do, and I think he believes he has figured that out."" Anderson raised three children in the Roman Catholic tradition of his first wife, but his work representing abuse victims in the 1980s turned him off to organized religion. He became an atheist but says he regained his faith 13 years ago, when he began confronting his alcoholism at AA meetings. ""I had to look at myself and turn things over to a higher spiritual power,"" said Anderson, who doesn't identify with a religious tradition and describes his faith as ""eclectic."" In 2002, revelations of church abuse and cover-up in Boston set off a wave of priest abuse allegations that turned church lawsuits into a national industry. ""Until that time, it was a solo journey,"" Anderson said. ""That set me on another trajectory entirely, with an intensity that hasn't slowed much if it all."" While the Boston scandal was still breaking, Anderson filed his first suit against the Vatican, on behalf of a Portland, Oregon, man who said he'd been abused by a priest as a teenager. Anderson argued that the Holy See, as the priest's employer, is ultimately responsible for the abuse. The Supreme Court is deciding whether to hear the case. A lower court has rejected the Vatican's argument that it is protected by the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act. The lawsuit Anderson filed last week against the Vatican goes much further, naming the Holy See, Pope Benedict XVI and the Vatican's current and former secretaries of state as defendants. The suit alleges that the Vatican had received a 1995 letter from a deaf American claiming that he'd been abused by a Wisconsin priest named Rev. Lawrence Murphy but that the Holy See allowed the priest to retain his position. The suit, filed by an unnamed plaintiff, seeks to force the Vatican to open its files on other abusive priests. The Vatican says the suit will fail because individual archdioceses, not the pope, are responsible for responding to abuse allegations. ""Anderson's mantra is that all roads lead to Rome,"" says Lena, the Vatican lawyer. ""I have a different message that Jeff wishes to ignore: this Church is administratively decentralized and decision making takes place largely on the local level. Mine is a more complex message, but it has the virtue of being right."" But that doesn't mean that the Vatican will stop paying close attention to Anderson. ""Jeff is such a media mover and shaker that when I go on an airplane, I'll call him and say 'I'm going to be on the plane for six or seven hours, so don't do anything -- I won't have a chance to respond!'"" said Lena. ""...He is half media man and half lawyer and has been successful at both."" For Anderson, both halves would likely be taken as a compliment.","Anderson has driven American media coverage of the church abuse scandal .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The leading contenders in Japan's upcoming national election kicked off their 12-day campaign Tuesday near the seaside prefecture that was at the heart of last year's nuclear disaster â€” and is now a powerful symbol of Japan's deepening economic woes. The man polls suggest will become the country's next leader appealed for votes in Fukushima City, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the site of last year's nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant. Shinzo Abe, leader of the opposition Liberal Democrat Party (LDP), has said that, if elected, he'll decide within three years whether to restart the nuclear plants that were shut down after an earthquake and tsunami triggered nuclear devastation in March 2011. He's a former prime minister who stepped down in 2007 after just one year in power citing health reasons. In his first official campaign speech Tuesday, Abe focused on economic arguments, saying he will act to counter deflation, weaken the yen and promote economic stability. ""We'll regain economic power in Japan,"" he said. Nearly two years after the nuclear meltdown, hundreds of thousands of people remain in temporary homes as the government, led by the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), sees its support slip away. The economy is weakening, and policymakers are under enormous pressure to restore communities affected by the disaster. Since assuming power in September 2011, current Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda has faced fierce resistance to his plan to raise government revenue by doubling the 5% sales tax by October 2015. He's dealing with an economy that's contracting -- by 3.5% between July and September -- after years of economic malaise. If GDP continues to shrink this quarter, the country will officially enter another recession. ""Any prime minister who has seriously taken up the cause of instituting or increasing an existing consumption tax rate -- if they succeeded or failed -- has lost power, so in that sense you have to give Noda his dues,"" said Keith Henry, founder of consultancy Asia Strategy. Last month, Noda agreed to dissolve the lower house of parliament, clearing the way for an election on December 16, as part of a deal to secure support for a crucial financial bill from the LDP. It was a risky move, and one that a poll released on Monday suggested would lead to Noda's removal from power, just one year after assuming office. The poll, conducted by Asahi Shimbun last weekend, suggests the LDP retained a 5% lead over the DPJ. Twenty percent of respondents said they'd vote for the LDP if the lower house election was held now, compared to 15% who'd vote for Noda's DPJ. Noda also launched his re-election campaign in Fukushima prefecture, at the Iwaki station, where he told supporters they faced a clear choice. ""The question in this lower house election is whether we can move forward with what we should do or whether we turn back to the old politics,"" he said. He has promised to phase out nuclear power by 2040, seizing on a popular backlash against the energy source since last year's nuclear disaster. It's a policy pledged by other smaller parties vying for votes in an election that's expected to see 1,500 candidates compete for 480 lower house seats. According to the polls, neither party is expected to win a majority, although Asia Strategy says a survey of polls shows that the LDP is on track for a coalition win, with its traditional ally the New Komeito Party. Amid flagging support for the major players, smaller parties have proliferated including The Japan Restoration Party, led by Shintaro Ishihara. The controversial former governor of Tokyo is perhaps best known outside the country for triggering a diplomatic spat with China over his move to buy disputed islands in the East China Sea. Earlier this year, he urged residents to donate cash to fund the purchase of the islands Japan calls Senkaku and China refers to as Diaoyu. The Japanese government eventually stepped in to buy the islands from private owners, provoking a sharp rebuke from Beijing and anti-Japanese protests across China. In the Asahi poll, 9% of respondents said they'd vote for Ishihara's JRP, the same proportion who said they'd give him their vote last week, indicating that his rising popularity may have stalled. Henry said that it's unlikely that this election will give marginal parties enough votes to influence the parliament. ""I'm convinced that these minor parties are going to remain minor parties,"" he said. ""They grab the attention of the media, they're old style curmudgeons but they won't gain any political influence."" Whether the combined leadership of the LDP and the New Komeito Party is able to introduce policies to contend with Japan's major structural challenges` remains to be seen, Henry said. If it can't, more political waves could be made when the upper house votes in an scheduled election next year, he said.

"(CNN) -- President Obama recently encouraged Americans to ""take about 10 minutes to answer 10 questions"" and fill out their 2010 census form. This year's questionnaire is one of the shortest in history, but the results of the survey have long-term effects. The census, taken every 10 years, is used to determine how to allocate more than $400 billion in federal funds and seats House of Representatives and determine the boundaries of representatives' districts. ""There is no representative democracy without it. It's the scientific, nonpartisan, apolitical starting point of what eventually becomes a quite partisan, political process,"" said Kenneth Prewitt, a professor at Columbia's School of International and Public Affairs and the former director of the United States Census Bureau. The House is made up of 435 congressional seats that represent relatively equal slices of the population. When data from the census show a shift in population, seats in the House get reassigned. Some states might pick up a seat or two, while others are forced to combine two districts into one. The process of apportioning seats is straightforward, but redistricting is much more complicated. Districts are supposed to be redrawn to reflect population changes and to make sure there is equal representation in the House. State legislators and governors typically draw the districts, but some states rely on restricting committees. Districts can affect the balance of power in the House and representation in the state legislature. ""People try to do things that are to their political advantage if they happen to be in power because maybe the next time the census comes out, the other party will be in power,"" said William Frey, a demographer and senior fellow with the Brookings Institution. Lawmakers have been accused of carving district lines around the constituents that will give their party an advantage and secure political gains. The process is known as gerrymandering, a term coined after Massachusetts Gov. Elbridge Gerry. Elected in 1810, he signed an obscure redistricting bill that enabled greater and perhaps disproportionate Republican representation in the Massachusetts legislature. Related: Who was Elbridge Gerry? Critics say gerrymandering gives those in power an unfair advantage and can dilute the power of minority groups. The Supreme Court in 2006 took up a case looking at a redistricting plan promoted by then-U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Texas. After the 2000 census, a state court redrew the Texas map with input from state lawmakers. But after Republicans gained control of the legislature in 2002, DeLay promoted a second redistricting proposal for congressional boundaries. The Texas legislature adopted the plan in 2003 after three contentious special sessions called by Republican Gov. Rick Perry. The legislative plan led to the 2004 ouster of four Democratic incumbents from Congress and sparked a bitter partisan battle. The court ruled that the redistricting plan unfairly weakened the voting strength of Latinos in two congressional districts and tossed out a portion of the congressional map, but found the overall redistricting plan engineered by state Republicans acceptable. Prewitt said the redrawing of lines to the benefit of one party or the neglect of other is just a part of the political process. ""The production of the statistics has got to be nonpolitical ... but the use of the statistics can be as political as the country wants it to be,"" he said. ""I expect people to try to take advantage of situations to advance their political goals, interests, values -- so it's healthy. Now, do I think overtime creating districts so incumbents are always re-elected is the healthiest way to have a democracy? No,"" Prewitt said, adding that it's up to the voters to decide whether they want to throw someone out of office. The more pressing issue for Prewitt is making sure everyone is counted because he said those who aren't counted will be treated unfairly in the political process and in the allocation of economic benefits. With more than 300 million people in the United States, it can be difficult to make sure than everyone is counted. Frey said calculating the homeless population and the population of those who do not speak English can be particularly challenging. Illegal immigrants, for example, sometimes opt not to turn in census forms for fear of legal ramifications. Those fears, however, are unwarranted because the information is confidential. ""The challenge that they have is a cost challenge,"" said Frey. The Census Bureau has to follow up with those who don't send in their forms with additional forms, telephone calls and even in-person visits -- and that adds up, he said. This year's census is projected to cost more than $14 billion. Prewitt said it's comparatively easy to count the first 75 to 85 percent, but the last 2 to 3 percent is ""really, really tough going."" As the census gets underway, Prewitt said trying to count everyone, as mandated by the Constitution, should be the top concern. ""I'm much more concerned about trying to have a fair census than I am about some drawing of odd lines after the census is over,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- It was billed as the battle of the heavyweights. In the red corner -- Radamel Falcao -- one of the most coveted strikers in world football and one of the most lethal finishers around. Only last week, Falcao hit five in his side's demolition of Deportivo to add to his already burgeoning reputation. In the blue corner -- Lionel Messi -- perhaps the greatest to have ever played the game. The man with 88 goals to his name in 2012. The magical and mesmerizing feet of Messi going up against the pace and predatory instincts of Falcao. It had all the ingredients of a classic. Between them they have run La Liga and European defenses ragged, scoring goals at will and leaving defenders trailing in their wake. Going into the clash, Messi had plundered 23 league goals to Falcao's 16. It was time for the two to go head-to-head. For Barcelona, victory over Atletico would place it nine points clear of its closest title rival and surely allow the Catalan club to wrestle the title away from defending champion Real Madrid. A win for Atletico would finally confirm that Diego Simeone's men could be taken seriously as a championship challenger. Magic Messi extends record streak . Atletico and Falcao -- the pretenders to Barcelona and Messi's crown. And pretenders they will remain. In the end, the chasm could scarcely have been greater as Simeone's men were put in their place without any sign of mercy from Tito Vilanova's side. Barca has now won 15 of its opening 16 league games, taking an astonishing 46 points from a possible 48. With Real Madrid only managing to draw with Espanyol earlier Sunday, Barca moved 13 points clear of its great rival. It was Messi who stole the show once again as the little magician emerged out of the shadows to crush Atletico. Two second-half strikes took his total to 90 for the calendar year and 25 league goals for the season as Barca came from behind to win 4-1. Messi map: How Argentine maestro conquered the world . And yet for the opening 30 minutes it appeared that the Messi's evening might have not been so enjoyable. Instead it was Falcao who took center stage, bullying Barcelona's defenders at every opportunity. It was the Colombia star who had the first opportunity of the contest, heading against the post after just nine minutes as Atletico signaled its intentions. Falcao then went close again after firing narrowly wide when well placed, while Messi seemed to vanish as Atletico took control of the contest. Barcelona was finally undone just after the half-hour mark when Falcao produced an exquisite finish to silence the majorityof those packed inside the Camp Nou. Messi fit to resume bid for goal record . After taking the ball in his stride, Falcao burst past Barcelona's central defenders before lifting the ball over the stranded Victor Valdes to net his 17th league goal of the season. It was no less than Atletico deserved, but that strike only served to awaken Barca from its slumber. No less than five minutes had elapsed before Barca drew level in spectacular style thanks to Adriano's stunning curling effort. The right-back turned onto his left-foot, before unleashing a wonderful rasping effort into the top corner to bring his side level. And with just seconds of the first half remaining, Busquets lashed home from close-range after Atletico had failed to clear. From dominating the game, Atletico had been rumbled in the blink of an eye. Messi makes case as world's greatest ever player . Worse was to follow as Messi began to find time and space as Atletico started to lose its way. Just 12 minutes of the second half had passed before the Argentine finally grabbed his trademark goal, firing home his 89th of the year with a neat curling effort. He reached 90 late on, taking advantage of a horrific defensive mistake to slot home his 25th league goal of the season. Incredibly, Messi has scored 58 out of Barcelona's 116 league goals in 2012. Mourinho: 'No story' in Real Madrid exit rumors . Meanwhile, the pressure continues to build on Real Madrid boss Jose Mourinho after he all but conceded defeat in the race for the title. Real fell further off the pace after being held to a 2-2 draw at home by lowly Espanyol and are 13 points off the lead. Espanyol had taken a shock lead through Sergio Garcia after 31 minutes before strikes from Cristiano Ronaldo and Fabio Coentrao put the home side in control. But with just two minutes remaining, Juan Albin popped up to steal a precious point for relegation-threatened Espanyol and leave Real reeling. ""The league is now impossible,"" Mourinho told reporters. ""It is the first time that I have been in a situation like this where my team are a long way off their objectives. ""But I don't want to make a drama out of it, I will treat it as another stage of my life.""

"London (CNN) -- Palace officials slammed the decision of the Irish Daily Star newspaper Saturday to print pictures of Prince William's wife Catherine sunbathing topless on vacation as driven only by greed. The Irish Daily Star's move comes a day after the royal couple launched legal action against the French magazine Closer over the images, and as Italian magazine Chi says it will publish the photos on Monday. ""There can be no motivation for this action other than greed,"" a St. James's Palace spokeswoman said of the Irish tabloid's decision. But editor Mike O'Kane told the BBC that outrage over the images was only felt in Britain and that readers in the Republic of Ireland wanted to know what all the ""kerfuffle"" was about. He was ""a little taken aback by the reaction in the UK,"" he said, saying the newspaper was treating Catherine no differently to any other celebrity. ""She's not the future queen of Ireland so really the only place this is causing fury seems to be in the UK,"" he said, suggesting that the British press were behaving with some hypocrisy. O'Kane said the Irish Daily Star was reproducing the images as published in Closer on Friday rather than buying them itself directly. The pictures are not being published in the Northern Ireland edition. Pacific welcome awaits William and Kate . The publication of the photos in the French Closer magazine, owned by the same parent company as Chi, the Mondadori Group, sparked an angry response from the royal couple and palace officials. William and Catherine were said to be ""hugely saddened"" by what palace officials called a ""grotesque"" invasion of privacy while they were on a private vacation. The latest controversy comes only three weeks after the British royal family was caught up in a media furor over images of William's younger brother, Prince Harry, partying naked in his Las Vegas hotel room with a group of girls. In a sign of how divisive the issue of royal privacy has become, a co-owner of the Irish Daily Star, media group Northern & Shell, said it in no way backed the newspaper's decision to run the pictures of Catherine. In a statement, the company -- which runs the Irish Daily Star in a joint venture with Independent News & Media, but does not exert editorial control over it -- said it was ""profoundly dismayed"" by the move. ""We abhor the decision of the Irish Daily Star to publish these intrusive pictures of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, which we, like St James's Palace, believe to be a grotesque invasion of their privacy,"" Northern & Shell's communications director Mimi Turner said. Northern & Shell also owns the Daily Express and the Daily Star, among other British publications, which have not run the pictures of Catherine, nor of Prince Harry. William, who is second in line to the throne, and his wife are on an official tour of southeast Asian nations. They were in Borneo Saturday, where they escaped from the outside world on a rainforest trek. They will travel on to the Solomon Islands Sunday on the next leg of a tour that has been overshadowed by the furor over the photographs. Catherine was ""upset"" with Closer magazine, a palace source told CNN. Mondadori told CNN it plans to run 26 pages of photographs of William and Kate on vacation in an ""extraordinary"" special edition to go on sale in Italy on Monday. Chi's front cover will also feature three revealing pictures of Catherine, according to a copy of the page and statement sent by Mondadori spokeswoman Carmen Mugione via e-mail. ""It is a story worth publishing in an extraordinary edition because it shows in a natural light the everyday life of a very famous contemporary young couple in love,"" Chi's editor-in-chief, Alfonso Signorini, is quoted as saying in the statement. ""The fact that they happen to be the future king and queen of England certainly makes it more interesting and current, and in line with today's concept of monarchy."" A St. James's Palace spokeswoman said: ""We will not be commenting on potential legal action concerning the alleged intended publication of the photos in Italy save to say that all proportionate responses will be kept under review. ""Any such publication would serve no purpose other than to cause further, entirely unjustifiable upset to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who were enjoying time alone together in the privacy of a relative's home."" The palace confirmed Friday that legal proceedings for breach of privacy had been launched in France by the couple against the publishers of Closer in France. Opinion: British privacy should start with British press . According to Mondadori's website, Closer has an average weekly circulation of about 414,000, while Chi sells more than 340,000 copies a week. Marina Berlusconi, daughter of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, has been chairwoman of the media group since 2003. Legal analysts suggest the company hopes to recoup any legal costs and fines it may incur by increasing sales, thanks to the revealing pictures. The grainy pictures published by Closer in France appear to have been taken with a long camera lens while the couple was staying at a private chateau belonging to William's uncle in Provence, in southern France. The new privacy controversies have dredged up the royal family's often rocky relationship with the press and put a spotlight on how the palace deals with the media after the tragic death of William's mother, Diana, as she fled photographers in Paris 15 years ago. William and Catherine were ""hugely saddened to learn that a French publication and a photographer have invaded their privacy in such a grotesque and totally unjustifiable manner,"" a St. James's Palace spokesman said Friday. ""The incident is reminiscent of the worst excesses of the press and paparazzi during the life of Diana, Princess of Wales, and all the more upsetting to the Duke and Duchess for being so,"" the palace spokesman said. ""Their Royal Highnesses had every expectation of privacy in the remote house. It is unthinkable that anyone should take such photographs, let alone publish them."" Laurence Pieau, editor-in-chief of Closer in France, defended the decision to publish the images in an interview with CNN affiliate BFM-TV, saying: ""We were just doing our job."" Pieau said that there had been no debate at the magazine over whether to publish the photos, and that they show the royals ""are just like any other couple in love."" The website of Closer on Friday showed the front cover of the magazine with blurry images of William and Kate, along with the headline ""Oh My God!"" but did not link to the four-page spread. UK tabloid prints naked Prince Harry pictures . But by Saturday that was replaced by a statement from the management of Closer, which said the photos it chose to publish ""are in no case degrading."" ""They show a young couple on vacation, beautiful, in love and modern, in their normal life. The article recounts the time the couple recently spent in southern France,"" it said. It also made clear the magazine is not linked with the UK publication of the same name. William and his wife were in Malaysia when the news broke, part way through a nine-day Southeast Asian tour of Commonwealth nations, which started in Singapore and will conclude with a stop in Tuvalu. The Asia tour forms part of diamond jubilee celebrations for the queen, William's grandmother. British lawyer Charlotte Harris said Friday that Closer's decision to publish was a clear breach of French legal codes and was out of line with current views on people's right to privacy. ""The perception of the French was that they are less aggressive, that they have a culturally different opinion of where privacy laws should lie. Here they appear to have gone right over the other way,"" she said. French law provides for ""draconian sanctions"" to protect against this kind of behavior, she said, including orders to take magazines off shelves and the imposition of serious fines. But even if distribution of the images is contained to a degree, Harris said, the damage is done to the extent that very private information about the duchess has now become public knowledge. No UK newspaper has so far published the photographs of Catherine. In the case of Prince Harry, the photographs were widely circulated online but were published in only one UK tabloid, The Sun, after palace officials asked UK media not to run them. The Sun has made clear that it won't publish the pictures of Catherine, however. Editor Dominic Mohan tweeted: ""The Sun has no intention of breaching the royal couple's privacy. The circumstances are very different to those relating to the photos of Prince Harry in Las Vegas."" The Press Complaints Commission, the UK press watchdog, received about 3,800 complaints from the public over the Prince Harry photos but said it was inappropriate for it to take any action in the absence of a formal complaint from the palace. Royal officials appear to be taking publication of the photographs of William and Catherine much more seriously. The British media is currently under close scrutiny after revelations of phone hacking and other abuses. The conclusions of an independent judge-led inquiry, which may recommend greater restrictions on media freedoms, are expected by the end of the year.

"(CNN) -- David Petraeus had another love affair long before the one that cost him his job running the CIA. It was with the press. The retired general's skillful courtship of journalists brought him a career's worth of favorable headlines and has, to a remarkable degree, softened the coverage of his fall from grace. Petraeus accomplished this in part by granting reporters access -- though none quite as extraordinary as that accorded his biographer, Paula Broadwell, who several news organizations have identified as the other woman in the extramarital affair he has acknowledged. Watch: Are the media unfairly trashing Paula Broadwell in Petraeus scandal? Consider, for instance, the way NBC's Andrea Mitchell, who broke the story of Petraeus' resignation on Friday, described her scoop. ""I don't take any pleasure in this in the sense that this is really a personal tragedy,"" Mitchell said on MSNBC. ""Having covered Gen. Petraeus myself here and overseas, I am absolutely convinced from all the communications I have had from people directly involved that this was a matter of honor."" Watch: Why are the media obsessing on Hillary Clinton and 2016? As NBC's longtime defense correspondent Fred Francis told me on CNN's ""Reliable Sources,"" Petraeus would call him and other reporters regularly to chat off the record or on background. Little surprise, then, that the tone of the coverage could be summed up as ""huh?"" Did Petraeus really have to quit over a garden-variety affair? Was this some sort of ploy to avoid testifying this week on the fatal attack at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi? Turns out FBI investigators stumbled upon the affair while looking into Petraeus' e-mail account. Watch: Karl Rove rejects reality on Fox News . His earlier relationships with journalists yielded benefits for both sides. During the Iraq invasion in 2003, Petraeus, then commanding the 101st Airborne, allowed Washington Post reporter Rick Atkinson to shadow him, including on a Black Hawk helicopter. Here is just one passage from what Atkinson, a stellar military reporter, later turned into a book: . King: Petraeus' resignation doesn't preclude testimony . ""We stood 15 feet beyond the tent flap. I blinked at the swirling dust, and felt grit between my molars. When Petraeus turned to face me, I was alarmed to see how troubled his blue eyes were. ""This thing is turning [bad],"" he said. ""The 3 ID"" -- the 3rd Infantry Division, fighting just ahead of the 101st around Najaf -- ""is in danger of running out of food and water. They lost two Abrams and a Bradley last night, although they got the crews out. The corps commander sounds tired."" Petraeus famously turned to Atkinson and said: ""Tell me how this ends."" Watch: Why Barack and Michelle photo went viral . Now that kind of access isn't just smoke and mirrors; Petraeus ran the risk that the mission might have been a disaster. But he trusted journalists, took them into his confidence, and in return was portrayed as a swashbuckling general, military intellectual and, eventually, potential presidential candidate. Newsweek even ran a feature on Petraeus' ""Rules for Living."" (The author? Paula Broadwell.) This is not to say the plaudits weren't deserved. Petraeus literally wrote the manual on counterinsurgency, made important gains while leading George W. Bush's surge in Iraq, and adjusted strategy when President Barack Obama asked him to oversee the war in Afghanistan. But since Obama sent Petraeus to Langley last year, he has kept an unusually low profile. As questions swirled about the CIA's role in the Benghazi tragedy, he said nothing publicly. A CIA director without the deep media relationships that Petraeus enjoyed would have faced a torrent of stories about why he was missing in action and whether he had bungled the job of diplomatic security. Instead, the press gave Petraeus a pass. What's your reaction to Petraeus' resignation? Sound off with CNN iReport . Maybe that's true on his career-ending episode as well. But that has hardly been the case with Broadwell, whose e-mails triggered an FBI investigation. (In hindsight, it might not have been the height of discretion to do a television tour about your book ""All In,"" talking about how awesome your subject is.) Author Tom Ricks, who portrayed Petraeus favorably in his Iraq war book ""Fiasco,"" writes on Foreign Policy's website: . ""Petraeus took the samurai route and insisted that he had done a dishonorable thing and now had to try to balance it by doing the honorable thing and stepping down as CIA director. But why? Petraeus is retired from the military. If the affair happened back when he was on active duty, it is part of the past. And there is nothing illegal about civilians having affairs."" Maybe that's the right tone. But contrast it with the way that politicians and business executives routinely get pummeled for fooling around -- though it's different, and should be, if subordinates are involved (or an intern, in Bill Clinton's case, or a housekeeper, as in Arnold Schwarzenegger's). News flash: Even top officials are human. They succumb to temptation. And they get a lot more sympathy in times of trouble from journalists they have befriended.

"(CNN) -- China has stepped up its engagement with Africa in recent years, scouring the resource-rich continent in its bid to access natural resources and forge new trade routes. But the Asian powerhouse is also emerging as an attractive business destination for Africans. China's booming economy has been luring an increasing number of Africans to its shores in recent years, most of them eager to export goods from the world's second-largest economy back into their continent. ""I found out there are a lot of opportunities of doing business,"" says Nigerian shop owner CJ Cajetan, who moved to Guangzhou two years ago as a student but decided to stay in China and try his luck as a clothes seller. Cajetan is one of the tens of thousands of Africans who've gone to live and work in Guangzhou, a manufacturing city located on the Pearl River in southern China. This strong new trading community builds on a growing business engagement between the two sides. Already Africa's largest trade partner, China's economic cooperation with the continent has shot up in recent times. Two-way trade between the two surged to a record $114.8 billion in 2010, according to Chinese authorities. Linking aid, trade and investment, Beijing's business model in Africa involves building extensive infrastructure projects in the continent and granting loans in exchange for access to natural resources, trade opportunities and expansion into new markets. Read more: Why Asian giants scent opportunity in Africa . But the burgeoning relationship between the two has also seen a number of African companies trying to get a foothold in the Chinese market, hoping to tap the country's growth and expanding middle class. South African drinks giant SABMiller has been working for years with a local Chinese brewer and now produces China's biggest selling beer. Such success can be achieved by more African companies as their nations gain a firmer footing, according to consultant Kobus van der Wath. ""China is very open for business for us,"" says van der Wath, founder of Beijing Axis, a China-focused international advisory firm. ""China's repositioning itself continuously for the new Africa that's emerging. We're very well received. We don't come with baggage,"" he adds. But despite the growing opportunities, many Africans in China still feel the overall relationship is far from a two-way street. In Guangzhou, some Africans complain of discrimination, restrictions on religious practices and visa issues. Residents like shipper Festus Mbisiogu -- who has been working in China for six years -- say they have trouble getting documents allowing their families to join them, making it harder for them to settle down. ""Our children are not allowed to reside in China and our joy is not fully complete, we are not living with our children,"" says Mbisiogu, of Blue Diamond Logistics. ""To make the money is not the problem ... but what about your family?"" Read more: Doing business in China: Five tips for success . Others say that navigating potential pitfalls, like protecting intellectual property, can also be a challenge in China. ""If people bring things into China to get them manufactured here, I think keeping that technology secret, as it were, will be very, very difficult,"" says Graham Hughes, a South African factory manager based near Beijing. The Chinese government says it's fighting to protect intellectual property rights. It also says it welcomes foreigners to work and live in China and says its visa policies have been applauded. Beijing has also been sponsoring programs at Chinese universities to encourage young Africans to come to the country to study. See also: Is the West losing out to China in Africa? One such student is Susanne Nambatya, from Uganda. ""I believe the social problems affecting China, they are the same problems affecting Uganda,"" says Nambatya. She takes part in a Masters program in Beijing, where she learns economic models that she hopes can spur her country to a sweeping transformation of its own . ""I keep asking my question, what is China doing that Uganda can't do?"" she adds. Fellow African student Martin Larbi says his China experience has also been enlightening. ""Coming to China I have seen the other side of industrialization,"" he says. ""I believe industrialization promotes the development of the economy, but the other side I've seen is the pollution of the environment -- it's hard for me to see the blue skies I used to see in my country."" But back in Guangzhou, Cajetan has adapted to his new environment. Like the students in Beijing, he wants to help modernize his home country one day by drawing on his experience in China. ""My plan is to establish a factory because I like to live in Lagos,"" he says. ""I like to help people. I want to employ people to work at my factory.""","Growing numbers of Africans are seeking economic opportunities in China .
Many are keen to export goods from world's second-largest economy back into Africa .

"(CNN) -- The unexpected resignation of David Petraeus as head of the CIA must have come as a shock to many Americans, especially given his impeccable record as a distinguished military commander. But like the greatest heroes from Shakespeare, it would appear that he was not exempt from the time-honored temptations of human folly and self-destruction. And now the plot is thickening, as details emerge that Gen. John Allen, the commander of U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan, is involved somehow in the scandal. As Americans are coming to terms with the revelation of Petraeus' adultery, on the other side of the Atlantic, the feeling among the French can be summed up by a blasÃ© shrug. Every time a steamy sexual intrigue is laid bare near the corridors of Washington power, the French don't see what all the fuss is about. It's only sex, after all. It's impossible to imagine a French political leader resigning because of an extramarital indiscretion. If this rule were observed, the French parliament would be nearly vacant. The Petraeus affair: A lot more than sex . The past five French presidents are known to have had at least one -- and in some cases, many more -- mistresses throughout their political career. The current resident of the ElysÃ©e Palace, Francois Hollande, has been caught in the middle of an embarrassing dispute between his previous and current female companions. The French, long used to regarding their leaders with cynical detachment, have been following this tormented domestic feud with interest and maybe some contempt. The details of Petraeus' sexual dalliance with his own biographer, Paula Broadwell, are unquestionably fascinating. Still, the French like to consider themselves blithely indifferent to bedroom antics, even when those involved are married to other people. Opinion: How Petraeus courted the press . Le Monde, the intellectually self-important leftist newspaper, noted that the Petraeus affair quickly jumped from the pages of the respectable New York Times to those of the gossipy tabloid New York Post. In other words, while the Petraeus scandal may indeed be a legitimate affair of state because of the sensitivity of his position at the summit of the CIA, what really interests Americans are the juicy details of the four-star Army general's sexual conquest. French bafflement at American prurience has a history -- from Bill Clinton's anteroom encounters with White House intern Monica Lewinsky to the more recent misadventures of Eliot Spitzer and Anthony Weiner. All have ended with abject confessions. The French usually attribute this American ritual of guilt and contrition to ""puritanism."" This is meant as a put-down and a mark of French cultural superiority. The French, by contrast, are mature and sophisticated, never shocked and titillated by the rich complexity of life's temptations. France is a Catholic society devoid of the puritanical guilt that is deeply embedded in the Anglo-American psyche. The French draw a line between private and public vice, whereas in America and Britain, the distinction is blurred if not merged entirely. In France, a politician can betray his wife without being suspected of screwing voters. Moreover, French journalists are not driven by the same ""fourth estate"" ethos that animates American media culture. French society in general has an ambiguous relationship with the truth, and French journalists are frequently indifferent to the exposure of hard facts. When the subject is the sexual indiscretion of politicians in high office, media indifference can be counted on because press and political circles in Paris are often intimated linked -- professionally, socially and sexually. Hence the famous media ""omerta"" about the private lives of French politicians. This convenient arrangement reached a high point of hypocritical disregard for the truth during the presidency of Francois Mitterrand, when the French media kept the secret of his double life -- including an illegitimate daughter living in an official residence at taxpayers' expense -- for nearly two decades. Everyone knew about it, nobody wrote about it. Opinion: How Petraeus changed the U.S. military . The shocking conduct of Dominique Strauss-Kahn shattered this longstanding media omerta. But French journalists are still reluctant to probe too aggressively into the private lives of politicians. They have good reason. In France, there are strict laws that make privacy invasion illegal and punishable. Only last month, Strauss-Kahn, though disgraced and banished from French politics, sued a magazine for publishing a photo of him and his new girlfriend. And he won damages in court. As the eye-popping details of Petraeus' complex personal life emerge in the American media, don't expect the French to respond with disbelief. They will claim they don't really want to know. No wonder. When it happens in France, they are often never told. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Matthew Fraser.","Matthew Fraser: The French don't see what's all the fuss is in the Petraeus scandal .

"Beijing (CNN) -- The Communist Party's 18th National Congress enters its second session Friday, a day after President Hu Jintao warned that a failure to deal with corruption could bring down the party and the state it controls. Hu spoke at a key meeting of top officials who will usher in a new set of leaders of the world's most populous nation. After a decade in power, Hu is expected to hand over the party's top job to Vice President Xi Jinping. ""If we fail to handle this issue well, it could prove fatal to the party and even cause the collapse of the party and the fall of the state,"" Hu said of corruption during his speech at the start of the congress in the Great Hall of the People in the heart of the Chinese capital. China's next leader keeps Iowa close to his heart . His comments to a vast room of delegates stood out in light of the huge political scandal that has rocked the party this year. The controversy involved former high-flying politician Bo Xilai, who is under criminal investigation after being ousted from his posts and the party itself. He is accused of corruption, abuse of power and improper sexual relationships; official news reports have said Bo made ""severe mistakes"" related to the killing of a British businessman -- a crime for which Bo's wife was imprisoned -- and a diplomatic incident involving his former police chief in Chongqing. More than 2,200 delegates from across China gathered for the congress. They will select the 200-plus members of the party's Central Committee, who in turn appoint the Politburo and ultimately the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee, the country's decision-makers. But most, if not all, of the outcomes are predetermined after a long period of secretive deal-making between party power brokers. 3 challenges for China's next leaders . The congress itself meets every five years. It is designed to assess the country's progress and set new directions. Every 10 years, it selects the new leadership. This year, the legacy of the Hu years is under the microscope. Under Hu and Premier Wen Jiabao, China's economy has continued to grow, lifting tens of millions of people out of poverty. China is now the world's second-biggest economy and closing fast on the United States. But there have been disappointments and discontent along the way, and Hu's much-vaunted ""harmonious society"" is showing signs of cracking. Read about what to expect in China-U.S. ties . Chinese leaders have endured a tumultuous year. The veil of secrecy around the party has been lifted, with reports of rifts and infighting. And the fall of Bo brought about China's biggest political scandal in decades. Bo, once party chief of the massive metropolis of Chongqing, is now in disgrace awaiting trial. His wife, Gu Kailai, is in prison, convicted of murdering a British business associate. As major Chinese leadership change begins, questions swirl . China is straddling many fault lines: a widening gap between rich and poor, rising unrest about issues like pollution and land seizures, and a slowing economy that some say is in need of serious reform. Another issue Hu's government has struggled to tackle during its decade in power is the discontent and unrest among Tibetans living under Chinese rule. Authorities were given a grim reminder on Wednesday of the disillusionment and desperation of many Tibetans in western areas of China after four people set themselves on fire to protest Chinese rule. One teenage Tibetan monk died and two were injured after self-immolating in a majority Tibetan region of Sichuan Province, said Penpa Tsering, a spokesman for the Tibetan parliament in exile in Dharamsala, India. And a 23-year-old Tibetan woman died a separate incident in Qinghai Province, Tsering said, citing unidentified people in Tibetan areas. Hu warns of corruption .","Party's national congress in second day .

""We can't have people working in and around aircraft exploiting their positions for criminal ends."" The investigation -- dubbed ""Operation Excess Baggage"" -- began in January 2010, when Jamaican authorities seized 53 pounds of marijuana from a suitcase, the immigration and customs agency said in a statement. The luggage, tagged with a Northwest Airlines baggage tag, was bound for Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport from an airport in Montego Bay, Jamaica, the statement said. Delta and Northwest merged in 2008. Authorities in Detroit later seized five suitcases containing 16 kilograms of cocaine and nearly 130 kilograms of marijuana, the statement said. In March 2010, federal agents seized 45 more pounds of marijuana from two Delta employees at the Detroit airport, the statement said. Authorities allege those individuals were participating in a separate smuggling operation between Detroit and Houston. A Twitter post from the airline said Delta fully cooperated with federal authorities in their investigation. ""Delta does not tolerate employees found using their position for illegal activity and these employees have been suspended without pay,"" the post said. ""Additional disciplinary action could be taken pending the final outcome of the investigation."" All 12 suspects were charged with possession of controlled substances with intent to distribute and conspiracy.","ICE says a suitcase stuffed with marijuana tipped off investigators .

"(CNN) -- It's one of the top 10 most-visited sites worldwide, with over 2 million articles in its English language edition. But is online encyclopedia Wikipedia's strength -- that anyone can edit it -- also its greatest weakness? Wikipedia: an invaluable repository of global knowledge or a magnet for digital vandals and hoaxers? This June, former president of the American Library Association, Michael Gorman hit out at academics who endorsed the use of Wikipedia to their students, saying in the Encyclopaedia Britannica blog that ""a professor who encourages the use of Wikipedia is the intellectual equivalent of a dietician who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything."" Gorman added that Google and Wikipedia were creating a generation of ""intellectual sluggards incapable of moving beyond the Internet,"" with no interest in exploring non-digital resources. Gorman's remarks received a mixed response. Some said that students should be taught to discern whether a source was authoritative. Others pointed to academics who cite Wikipedia, saying it was unfair to prevent students from doing the same. Ben Fairweather, research fellow in the center for computing and social responsibility at De Montfort University, England, was quoted in the Times Higher Education Supplement saying that Internet resources had made research more efficient and removed some of the ""drudgery out of producing good work."" Gorman's position was that he was not taking issue with the technology per se, but was concerned by the lack of peer review based on an intellectual meritocracy, adding, ""That meritocracy must be based on respect for expertise and learning."" Perhaps surprisingly, this view is shared by Larry Sanger, who was with Wikipedia from the start and is often referred to as a co-founder. (Though that's up for debate on the site, too.) When he parted ways with Wikipedia, Sanger felt that the site's vulnerability to vandalism could undermine its reputation. That spurred him to set up ""Citizendium,"" a rival wiki-based project where articles are vetted by known experts and authors are required to use their real names. Citizendium launched this year with the aim to become ""the world's most trusted knowledge base,"" though with just 3000 articles to hold to Wikipedia's 2 million, some would question whether the site can ever catch up. For the most part, Wikipedia is working. A 2005 study by British journal Nature found that the online encyclopedia was about as accurate as its competitors on science. But a commonly cited peril of Wikipedia's anonymity is vandalism. In one notorious example, journalist John Seigenthaler Sr. was listed as a suspect in both Kennedy assassinations by a prankster: the entry remained up for four months in 2005. Such abuse tends to get quickly swept away by the site's volunteers, especially if an article has been placed on a watch list by editors who are interested in the subject. Still, at any given point, Wikipedia visitors can't be sure of what they're getting. Look no further than the Seigenthaler entry: For 31 hours last September, he was said to have killed and eaten JFK. Seigenthaler slammed the site in an opinion piece in USA Today, berating Wikipedia's ""volunteer vandals with poison-pen intellects."" Some might say that the edits in Seigenthaler's profile would never have made it into the mainstream media. But those seeking proof of just how much emphasis even professional journalists can place on Wikipedia need look no further than the example of Ronnie Hazlehurst, a British composer of TV theme tunes for shows including ""Yes, Minister"" and ""Last of the Summer Wine,"" who died this October. According to several high-profile obituaries, including the BBC, Reuters, the London Times and The Guardian, Hazlehurst, at the age of 72, also penned ""Reach,"" a 2000 hit for UK pop combo S Club 7. The unfortunate writers had omitted to double-check his Wikipedia discography, and collectively fell victim to Wiki-hoaxers. Even those who spot errors in their own profiles can be reluctant to address them. In April this year, Pulitzer Prize-winning author and academic Douglas Hofstadter told the New York Times of his Wikipedia entry, ""[it] is filled with inaccuracies, and it kind of depresses me."" When asked why he didn't fix it, he replied, ""The next day someone will fix it back."" Wikipedia recognizes that to-and-fro tussling -- or ""edit warring"" -- is damaging to its reputation, and some of the more controversial topics -- such as those on Islam, Elvis Presley and abortion -- have been locked to limit who can alter them. But as its reputation as an online resource has grown, the encyclopedia has also become a target for corporate spin. In January this year, the Associated Press reported that Microsoft had offered a blogger cash to alter Wikipedia articles. Microsoft claimed that the articles contained inaccuracies on an open-source document standard and a rival format put forward by the software giant. Then, this summer, Virgil Griffith, a 24-year-old Cal Tech graduate student, unearthed some eyebrow-raising data. Wired.com reported in August that Griffith created an application called WikiScanner that tracks edits that have been made to Wikipedia articles and cross-references them against IP addresses, which can be traced back to companies' offices. Griffith proved what many had suspected for some time: that edits on company profiles were often originating from IP addresses owned by those companies and even their competitors. Just a few of the corporations listed included Exxon Mobil, Apple, Microsoft and Wal-Mart, along with several politicians' offices. """"It was dead easy,"" Griffith told Forbes.com. ""I just combined two databases and -- poof -- you have these public relations disasters."" Some of those edits, Wired reported, appeared to be ""transparently self-interested, either adding positive, press release-like material to entries, or deleting whole swaths of critical material."" Wired cited the example of voting-machine company Diebold, ""with someone at the company's IP address apparently deleting long paragraphs detailing the security industry's concerns over the integrity of their voting machines, and information about the company's CEO's fund-raising for President Bush."" The deleted text was restored by a Wikipedia contributor, who added: ""Please stop removing content from Wikipedia. It is considered vandalism."" So should we turn our backs on Wikipedia -- scratch it and start again? Absolutely not. As a project -- to gather together our collective knowledge -- Wikipedia is admirable. As a repository for human knowledge, it is invaluable. As an introductory resource on anything from scientific formulae to walk-on characters in TV sitcoms, its breadth is unmatched. Its content is also a priceless reflection of humanity and its concerns. Only a tiny fraction of its vast repository is polluted by vandals, hoaxers and ne'er-do-wells, who in turn are chased down by its dedicated band of editors and administrators. But a resource that can be edited by experts and non-experts alike will always carry risks, and perhaps that's Wikipedia's greatest lesson for us all: that its very existence must force us to question notions of accuracy and reliability, while giving us a means to correct errors and add to the global knowledge pot. Two things are certain: no encyclopedia will ever be perfect, and we will never reach consensus on all Wikipedia articles. And in the meantime, while an invaluable first port of call, those using Wikipedia would be well advised to confirm their facts elsewhere. .............................. Do you take Wikipedia at face value, or with a pinch of salt? Should we learn from the experts, or does each of us have a part to play?

"(CNN) -- Mexican immigration to the United States has dropped sharply since 2005, but the flow of migrants returning to Mexico remains steady, according to a study released Wednesday by the Pew Hispanic Center. Plaques mark the U.S.-Mexico border near Laredo, Texas. Immigration from Mexico to the United States slowed at least 40 percent between mid-decade and 2008, according to the analysis, based on national population surveys in the United States and Mexico, as well as Border Patrol apprehension figures. The Mexican survey estimated that 1 million Mexicans left for the United States in a 12-month period beginning in 2006. Three years later, that number decreased to 636,000. ""The size of the drop has been quite remarkable in such a small span of time,"" Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center and author of the study, told CNN. The recession and enhanced border enforcement are factors that may explain the decrease in apprehensions of unauthorized immigrants in the United States, according a Department of Homeland Security bulletin released last month. But if diminished job prospects in the United States have kept would-be immigrants in Mexico, employment worries haven't increased the number of Mexican migrants leaving the United States, the study found. An estimated 433,000 Mexican migrants returned home between 2008 and 2009, a number not significantly different than the 479,000 who returned three years earlier, Passel said. While the number of Mexican migrants entering the United States remains greater than the number returning, the study shows that the gap is closing to the point of nearing a balance between migrant inflows and outflows. ""My guess is you have to go back at least 40 years or 50 years to see that,"" Passel said. It is too early to tell, however, if either trend ""points to a fundamental change in U.S.-Mexico immigration patterns or is a short-term response to heightened border enforcement, the weakened U.S. economy or other forces,"" the study states. The economic downturn has certainly affected work opportunities for immigrants in the United States, said Alfredo Reyes, a day laborer who does construction and yard work in Atlanta area. ""There are weeks where I have three days of work and the other four without work,"" the Michoacan, Mexico, native told CNN. Despite the reduced availability for work, Reyes plans on staying put because the economic downturn is global. ""I think things are more difficult there (in Mexico),"" he said. The two trends found in the Pew study should not be surprising, Rodolfo de la Garza, a professor at Columbia University and an expert on immigration, told CNN. For those in Mexico, it remains expensive and risky to be smuggled into the United States, especially in a weak economy, he said. ""Things are worse in Mexico than they are here,"" de la Garza said. ""The job you have here is better than what you have there. If you go back, what do you go back to?"" Another reason that Mexicans living in the United States might stay is that they feel at home, he said. Despite the stereotype of the United States as an anti-immigrant destination, ""at local levels, there is very little harassment,"" de la Garza said. ""By and large, people are accepting of immigrants."" Another day laborer in Georgia, who declined to give his name, said that the current economic crunch left him without the resources to return to his native Oaxaca, Mexico, even if he wanted. But even during these tough times, he is content. ""It's simple, we like living here in the United States,"" he said.","Recession, border enforcement cited as possible reasons for decline .

"(CNN) -- A Connecticut man who attempted to amputate his own arm after it was trapped in a furnace credits ""human spirit"" for his survival. ""Human spirit, its strong,"" Jonathan Metz, 31, of West Hartford, Connecticut, said Tuesday during a news conference at a hospital where he is being treated following his ordeal last week. ""And trust me, whether it's cutting your arm off or finding some other way, I think all people would be surprised by what they're capable of,"" added Metz, whose arm became trapped in the vents of a furnace. Speaking from Hartford's Saint Francis Hospital, Metz explained how he was reaching for a fallen vacuum cleaner piece when his arm became stuck in the vents of the furnace. After 12 hours of yelling for help, Metz had no sense of when he would be rescued. He said he became desperate when he started to smell rotting flesh, and knew had to take extreme measures if he was going to survive. ""It took me about six hours to psych myself up to the point where I thought I was capable of actually doing what I thought needed to be done,"" Metz said. ""After about 18 hours of being trapped, with my arm stuck in the boiler, I fashioned a tourniquet out of the shirt I was wearing, tied it as best I could, and started cutting,"" said Metz. ""As luck would have it, I had the blades that I would use with some of my power tools."" Metz said about half way through the cut ""the pain became absolutely too much to continue."" ""I would describe I guess what was a near-death experience at that point. I had given up,"" Metz said. It was then that he began to think about what he would leave behind if he was never rescued, he said. ""I started having these images about my dog Porsche upstairs who was probably also battling dehydration at that point, and my fiance, and my parents, and my friends."" With dehydration setting in, Metz could feel his tongue swelling and knew he needed water. He was able to turn on the boiler release valve and drink some of the dirty water. The water, which he scooped up to his mouth with his sandal, gave him new energy and he continued calling for help. Eventually, friends -- worried after not seeing Metz for three days -- alerted police. Metz was falling unconscious when rescuers found him, and he said Tuesday that if his friends hadn't alerted police, headlines would have proclaimed his death, rather than his amazing rescue. According to West Hartford Fire Chief Matt Stuart, rescuers ripped apart the furnace using heavy tools, and completed the amputation. The arm could not be reattached due to infection, according to doctors from Saint Francis Hospital. Dr. David Shapiro was inspired by Metz's actions saying, ""The way that he did it was frightening, admirable, horrifying, brave, and just amazing to us."" Tina Varona, media relations manager for the hospital, said that Metz's attempt saved his life because sepsis, when the bloodstream is overwhelmed by bacteria, was beginning to set into his injured arm. ""Surgeons were able to clean and cover the bone with muscle tissue that was still healthy and viable, thanks to Metz's efforts. They were able to modify and close up the wound in a two-and-a-half hour operation,"" Varona said.","Jonathan Metz struggled for hours last week after his arm became trapped in a furnace .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Malala Yousefzai now has a day named after her and more than two million people from around the world pledging to carry on her fight for girls' education. The United Nations has declared November 10 as Malala day to honor the 15 year-old Pakistani activist who was shot in the head one month ago by the Taliban, which wanted to silence her campaign for education. Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown marked the occasion here on Friday by delivering a petition to the Pakistani government with one million signatures calling on Islamabad to enroll every Pakistani boy and girl in primary school. Brown: Time to turn slogan into reality . Pakistani civil society organizations matched the U.N.'s signature drive with a petition of their own, signed by 1.2 million Pakistanis supporting Malala's cause. ""The march for the right to girls' education cannot be stopped,"" Brown told students during a visit to a girls' school in Islamabad. ""Indeed it is unstoppable."" In Pakistan, girls' education has long been hampered by widespread poverty, a bias against girls' education by hardline Islamist groups, and what many view as a corrupt government. Malala: From near death to recovery . According to U.N. figures, 32 million of the world's school-aged girls do not get an education. Roughly 10 percent of those girls -- 3.1 million -- live in Pakistan. In a country where nearly 50 million Pakistanis can't read or write, two-thirds are women -- the third highest number of illiterate women in the world. A Population Council report this year said Pakistan spends less public money on education than any other south Asian country. The U.N. says Pakistan spends seven times more on the military than on primary education. Despite the statistics, the attack on Malala appears to have brought renewed hope and energy in the campaign to educate Pakistan's girls. ""There's a huge momentum now,"" Brown said. ""People are saying I was silent before but I'm not going to be silent as long as girls are denied an education."" But for now, there's only the promise of help. The Pakistani government, the U.N., the World Bank, and other international organizations have set an April 2013 deadline to come up with a plan to provide education to all of Pakistan's school-aged children by the end of 2015.","Ex-UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown delivers girls' education petition Islamabad .

"(CNN) -- My grandchildren and I made history this summer. It was our personal history; our family history. We made memories we'll be able to relive and pass on to others. The adventures began when I asked each of my three oldest grandchildren to pick a place he or she wanted to visit and do research on the fun activities the child and I could do there -- just the two of us -- for a week. No amusement parks, no fancy hotels; my finances were limited because of a recent forced retirement, so we would be camping, as well as finding inexpensive or free things to do. The location had to be east of the Mississippi and require no more than one overnight stop to get there by car from our starting point, their home near Nashville, Tennessee. It turned out only Rosa, 14, had enough decision-making experience to pick a spot (New Orleans -- only slightly west of Mississippi), so I talked the possibilities over with the others -- Savannah, 11, and Camron, 12 -- until we decided on itineraries for their trips. 10 of America's best historic restaurants . Savannah chose to go to Savannah, Georgia, and Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, doing lots of swimming and sightseeing. We included stops at her favorite aunt and uncle's home in Atlanta along the way. Camron did not feel strongly about a location, so he joined me at home in Williamston, Michigan, and helped me with some cat-sitting duties. Still, our time together included camping on Lake Michigan, climbing a sand dune and discovering or rediscovering lots of near and distant relatives. Rosa was decisive about seeing New Orleans, and her research resulted in a whole list of places to go and things to see, all of them affordable. We covered everything on her list, plus more. I had some concern that traveling with young teens or preteens might be tricky. Would they talk to me? Would they be bored? Would we enjoy the same activities? Their excitement dispelled any misgivings. Each one was happy going just about anywhere and eagerly anticipated their own ""grandma time."" The chance to be special pals for several days overshadowed the importance of the actual destination on both sides, and I never heard one mention of being bored. So consider a trip with your young relatives. Make memories. Here are some strategies that helped make these summer trips historical -- and smooth -- for us: . Stock up. Stopping at the grocery store was always among our first orders of business. Each grandchild got to select food he or she especially liked, keeping in mind that we would be cooking on my small electric hotplate. They were all very considerate of my needs as a vegan and tended to choose food we both could eat. We also splurged on simple treats that would withstand the rigors of long car rides and camping. Be curious. The grandchildren controlled the radio, but sometimes we turned it off and just talked to each other. Camron decided to ask me questions: ""What is the most dangerous thing you've ever done?"" Or, ""Where would you go if you could go anywhere in the world?"" After I answered, often with a story about his father as a child or my adventures living in Jamaica, I would turn the question on him, and he would regale me with his own dreams and adventures. 7-million-mile family shares travel secrets . Join in. Memories were made when I actually got in the water, climbed the hill, let the birds land on me and generally participated first-hand in what my grandchildren were enjoying. Watching them play or taking pictures was nice, but something great happened when we were able to splash, race and float together. Stay loose. Simple things were often the most memorable things. A ride on the trolley car, meeting new relatives, preparing a meal together and hearing one another's personal stories were the things that the kids talked about long after the trip was over. The limits on spending didn't deter them, either. Some of our best times were spent having dessert in an all-night coffee shop, holding a live chicken for the first time, finding an airport with the same name as Savannah, admiring the architecture in the French Quarter, naming rocks discovered on the beach at Lake Michigan and watching Grandma go nuts when the directions did not get us to where we wanted to go. We asked: Your travel planning philosophy . Rest. Down time was some of the best time. After a day of being on the go, a trip to the grocery store, a few minutes watching TV together, a swim in the pool or some other quiet activity were often ideal times to relive the fun of the day, plan the next outing or find that one more thing we had in common. Rosa cooking me dinner at the campsite, using shrimp we had bought in the French Quarter, was one of those low-key evenings that proved to be a high point. Don't overplan. Planning for each trip was essential, but some of the best opportunities to make history together came when we least expected them. Case in point: We ran into my sister at the local library and discovered that her grandson was visiting. Our two grandsons ended up spending the night together camping on my balcony and having their own adventures. Are you a window flier or an aisle seater? Share decision-making. Each grandchild was at a different level of maturity regarding making choices, but as their week progressed, I saw each one grow in their ability to come up with wonderful ideas, to be considerate of the needs of both of us and to choose among good options. Stay connected to home. It was a surprise to me that at 11 and 12, Savannah and Camron each had a real adjustment to make being away from home, without parents or siblings to look to. Vannah brought along a framed picture of her parents, which helped her feel more secure. My cell phone served as a lifeline for both children, as well as for Mommy, who was suffering a little separation anxiety herself. Each day the children grew in their independence, and the phone calls got fewer and shorter as our time together stretched on. Keep a record. To continue sharing our stories after the week was over, I purchased inexpensive thumb drives for each grandchild and saved all the pictures from their trip on their own drive. This way, we both would have copies of all the pictures. The day after we returned home, Rosa posted all of her 497 pictures on her Facebook page. Listen. One of the experience's unexpected blessings came when I was able to stay for a few days with the whole family after each trip. This gave me a chance to hear the stories of our trips from my grandchildren's perspectives. The extra bonus: I am now the ""fun grandma."" Can you relate?

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Federal agents charged four Georgia men they say are part of a fringe militia group with plotting to attack government officials with explosives and the biotoxin ricin, prosecutors in Atlanta announced Tuesday. A government informant recorded the men discussing plans to manufacture ricin, a highly poisonous substance derived from castor beans, and attack Justice Department officials, federal judges and Internal Revenue Service agents, according to court papers released Tuesday afternoon. Prosecutors said the public was never in imminent danger. All four suspects were in custody and are scheduled to make their initial court appearances Wednesday in Gainesville, about 50 miles northeast of Atlanta, the U.S. attorney's office announced. ""When it comes time to saving the Constitution, that means some people gotta die,"" an arrest affidavit quotes one of the defendants, Frederick Thomas, as saying during one recorded conversation. According to arrest affidavits filed in the case, 67-year-old Dan Roberts and Thomas, 73, agreed to buy a silencer, a bomb and parts to convert a semi-automatic rifle to a fully automatic machine gun from an undercover agent. Meanwhile, 65-year-old Ray Adams and 68-year-old Samuel Crump worked to obtain castor beans and produce ricin, an FBI agent states in the documents. ""While many are focused on the threat posed by international violent extremists, this case demonstrates that we must also remain vigilant in protecting our country from citizens within our own borders who threaten our safety and security,"" U.S. Attorney Sally Quillian Yates said in a written statement announcing the arrests. The affidavits don't identify the ""known militia organization"" of which FBI agents say the men are a part. But according to the documents, they talked about spreading ricin across several cities at once, including Washington, Atlanta, New Orleans and Jacksonville, Florida. During an April meeting at his home, Thomas allegedly told participants he had a ""bucket list"" of politicians, government officials, corporate leaders and media figures he said should be targeted to ""make the country right again."" ""I could shoot ATF and IRS all day long. All the judges and the DOJ and the attorneys and prosecutors,"" the affidavit quotes Thomas as saying. Crump allegedly said he wanted to make 10 pounds of ricin for distribution. ""Dump that little (unintelligible) that's all you gotta do is lay it in the damn road, the cars are gonna spread it,"" the affidavit quotes him as saying. According to one of the affidavits, Crump formerly worked for a contractor doing ""maintenance type services"" at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Crump also spoke of an even deadlier substance, ""worse than anthrax,"" but the group would need financial backing to produce it, according to the affidavit. The document states a castor bean provided to the informant by Adams and Crump tested positive for ricin. The U.S. Agriculture Department verified Adams formerly worked at the Agriculture Research Service as a lab technician, an affidavit says. According to another affidavit, Thomas allegedly said the group was ready to move forward with obtaining silencers from an active-duty member of the U.S. Army. In a phone call, he also said the four began physical training to prepare for their plans, the affidavit states. Yates told CNN Atlanta affiliate WXIA that the investigation began earlier this year when an informant talked with the FBI about conversations he had overheard. The informant taped conversations with the four suspects and an undercover agent began talking with them, Yates said. She said the defendants had taken ""substantial steps"" in the alleged plot. ""They had some of the (ricin) ingredients that were necessary but not all the ingredients,"" she said. ""It's really important for the public to know and be assured that the FBI was on top of this and they were monitoring this every step of the way. "" Discussions on how to spread the ricin included driving down an interstate highway and allowing it come out the window, Yates told WXIA. According to one affidavit, the confidential informant is on bond for pending felony state charges. An FBI polygrapher determined the individual ""gave less than truthful responses concerning the activities of the militia group."" But, the affidavit states, the credibility of the informant has been demonstrated by the source's accurate recounting of the conversations the source recorded during meetings, ""when compared to the audio and video recordings of the meetings and physical surveillance of those meetings conducted by law enforcement agents."" Adams, Crump and Roberts are from Toccoa, about 90 miles northeast of Atlanta, while Thomas is from nearby Cleveland, Georgia, prosecutors said. CNN's Sara Pratley contributed to this report.","Public was never in imminent danger, prosecutor says .

"(CNN) -- Three times as many Asian-Americans have been running for Congress in 2012 than in the past two elections, a nonpartisan political group says, and it's a development that portends greater changes in demographic trends and reflects the recent political awakening of a minority group long confined to the margins of American society. ""It's extremely exciting,"" says Gloria Chan, president and CEO of the Asian Pacific Institute for Congressional Studies. ""We could really stand to gain seats and affect the balance of power in Congress."" Including Pacific Islanders, 30 Asian-Americans launched campaigns for Congress this year, compared with 10 in 2010 and eight in 2008, according to an APICS count. Though several of the Asian-American candidates lost their primaries, others stand to become the first people of Asian descent in their respective states -- New York, Tennessee and Florida, for instance -- to join the legislative body. Appearing on CNN Sunday night, U.S. Rep. Judy Chu, D-California, heralded this year's election as a potential watershed moment for Asian-Americans in politics. ""It's a great step forward for all of us when the people who are making the decisions about America look like America,"" said Chu, who in 2009 became the first Chinese woman elected to Congress. ""I am so proud of these Asian-Americans who are now running."" Chan added that Asian-Americans' surging involvement in politics could have reverberations far beyond Washington. ""For the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community, there's always this stereotype -- we're quiet, we don't speak up, we don't fight back when we're made fun of, we're nerds, etc."" Chan says. ""It's been difficult for Asian-Americans to break through those stereotypes."" Opinion: Will Jeremy Lin's success in NBA end stereotypes? But Chan is optimistic that the recent explosion of Asian-Americans in prominent positions could help dispel the stereotype and ""shed light on what our communities are really about and the challenges we face."" Having Asian-Americans in leadership roles, she said, could augment the group's political voice. Yet some experts noted that the campaigns also have the capacity to show the ugliness of American racism. ""There's always been this question, 'How American are Asians?' "" says Curtis Chin, board president of Asian Pacific Americans for Progress. ""A lot of politicians still play off of this: 'Asian-Americans, how much do we trust them? Where are their loyalties?' In districts where there isn't a lot of exposure, they can be defined in racial ways."" Chin added that, unlike some groups, Asian-American politicians face the additional difficulty of lacking an entrenched support network, noting that ""it's a community that's still developing an infrastructure."" ""I think there's still a big learning curve. When you compare (Asian-Americans) to a community that has a pool of donors, a list of talking points -- I think there's still a lot of work to be done,"" he said. ""But I think there's a lot of opportunity, too, because these candidates are fresh. ... We're a new face, we're not the standard politician you've seen before."" Rep. Michael Honda, D-California, is an Asian-American elected to Congress in 2001, and he agreed that some candidates try to leverage their opponents' perceived foreignness into electoral advantage. ""Some will say this person has connections to China or Japan. ... There's so much out and out blatant racism. In 2010, there were a handful of politicians who used Chinese or Asian languages in their commercials,"" Honda said, though he added he had not yet seen similar bigotry in the 2012 races. Honda is no stranger to anti-Asian sentiment in America. Just a toddler at the time, he and his parents were forced into a Japanese internment camp during World War II -- a memory Honda says left an indelible imprint on his career and aspirations. He said that as he grew up, he increasingly understood the necessity for Asian-Americans to gain a political foothold. But that was difficult, if not impossible, for a population that represented a fraction of the population. That may be rapidly changing. According to a report released in June by the Pew Research Center, Asian-Americans are among the fastest-growing groups in the United States. In 2010, 36% of new immigrants to the U.S. were Asians while 31% were Hispanics, the study found. Just a decade ago, 19% of immigrants were Asians and 59% were Hispanics. The growth of Asian-Americans' political clout tends to favor Democrats. Of the 30 who filed to run in 2012, 25 are Democrats, according to APICS. About 60% of the diverse group -- which experts urge should not be considered a monolithic entity -- voted for Barack Obama in 2008.

"(CNNGo) -- ""Getting away from it all"" may be a travel marketing clichÃ©, but the phrase might take on a whole new meaning come 2016. Russian firm Orbital Technologies plans to open the first space hotel in history in five year's time. The space hotel, or ""Commercial Space Station,"" as it's officially called, will float 250 miles above Earth. The hotel can accommodate a maximum of seven people at a time. To check in, tourists will have to undergo special training that can take up to three months, depending on the type of spacecraft they fly to the hotel. The firm says that stays can range from three days to six months. CNNGo: Flying train unveiled by Japanese scientists . On-board recreation .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- House Democrats told the president Monday he won't be getting money to close the military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, until he has a ""concrete program"" for shutting it down and moving its prisoners. A guard talks to a detainee at Guantanamo earlier this year. The $80 million will be dropped from President Obama's supplemental request for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rep. David Obey told reporters. ""So far as we can tell, there is yet no concrete program for that,"" said Obey, D-Wisconsin. ""And while I don't mind defending a concrete program, I'm not much interested in wasting my energy defending a theoretical program. So when they have a plan, they're welcome to come back and talk to us about it."" The administration requested $50 million for the Defense Department and $30 million for the Justice Department to close the prison, Democratic aides said. Republicans have been pounding Obama and the Democrats over the proposed closure, saying that closing the facility could push detainees into facilities in the United States, making the country less safe. Sen. John McCain, Obama's Republican rival for the presidency last year, supports closing the facility, and argued for moving the prisoners to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas. A Democratic leadership aide insisted there is ""no distance"" between Democrats and the White House on closing Guantanamo. Anticipating the loss of some Democratic votes on the supplemental request, Democratic leaders hoped to gain some Republican support by removing the Guantanamo funding, the aide said. Brendan Daly, spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, said the move does not change plans to close the prison. ""We will work with President Obama to achieve our goal of closing Guantanamo Bay,"" he said. Last week, Defense Secretary Robert Gates told reporters the Justice Department was reviewing each of the detainees at Guantanamo to determine what to do with them. ""Those discussions have just gotten started,"" he said. ""There clearly will be a specific plan that comes out of this, but what we've had to await is the determination, roughly speaking, of about how big a group of people we will be talking about."" Gates said the $50 million for his department was intended ""as a hedge that would allow us to get started if some construction is needed to be able to accommodate those detainees."" The Justice Department portion, he said, is to pay for ""the process of going through these determinations."" About 240 prisoners remain at the detention facility.  The $94.2 billion supplemental request will be the last, because Obama has put the wars on the budget going forward. Democrats added to Obama's requests for addressing the H1N1 flu virus as well as funding to fight the war in Afghanistan and assist Pakistan's government. Obey said he was ""very doubtful"" that Obama's policies in those two countries would succeed, ""but there's a consensus in the Congress to try it."" Some anti-war Democrats were pushing to include benchmarks or some strings for money for Afghanistan and Pakistan, but the bill does not put conditions on any of the money, he said. Instead it requires that the president report to Congress in a year and address five ""standards of performance"" outlined in the bill. ""I would hope it would be a fish or cut bait report,"" Obey said. Pressed on whether Congress would cut off money for operations in the region if signs of progress aren't demonstrated, the Wisconsin Democrat said it is up to individual members of Congress, but added, ""If it becomes a fool's errand, I would hope so."" Democrats also added $400 million to the administration's request for Mexico for the drug war and surveillance helicopters. The House Appropriations committee will vote on the bill Thursday, and the House is expected to vote on it next week. CNN's Dana Bash and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","Obama administration had requested $80 million to close the prison .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- With irresponsible banking practices taking the blame for bringing about the global economic crisis, there has been a surge of interest in Islamic finance. Islamic finance is estimated to be worth $700 billion and has been growing by 15 to 20 percent per year. Now, a slew of academic courses are springing up to meet the demand of those wanting to break into an expanding market. According to ratings agency Moody's, the global Islamic finance sector is worth $700 billion and has the potential to be worth $4 trillion. What's more, the ethical principles underpinning Islamic finance are seen by some as offering a more sustainable alternative to profit-oriented conventional banking. The result is that academic institutions are lining up to offer formal training in the area. ""There is a huge demand for Islamic finance courses now, so large that it's difficult to cope with,"" Professor Habib Ahmed, Sharjah chair in the school of government and international affairs at Durham University, England, told CNN. Durham will launch a Masters degree in Islamic finance from October, becoming one of a number of European institutions to offer Islamic finance programs. ""Islamic finance has been growing by 15 to 20 percent per year for some time and there is a lot of interest at the moment. People are looking for alternatives after the economic crisis."" ""Islamic economists believe that if the principles of Islamic finance were followed the crisis wouldn't have happened. We are seeing a lot of non-Muslim countries, including the UK, France, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore encouraging Islamic finance,"" he said. There are many differences between Islamic and conventional banking practices. One fundamental difference is that Islamic banks do not charge interest. Rather than borrowers and lenders, the system is based on buyers and sellers. ""Conventional banking is biased to the seller. Islamic finance is trying to level the ethics between the two parties,"" Aly Khorshid, an Islamic finance scholar who writes for Islamic Banking and Finance magazine, told CNN. ""People think the Islamic system is based on faith, but it's based on justice. The system is based on justice for the two parties and how you get to the justice is extracted from Islamic faith,"" he said. Khorshid said that there are similarities between ""ethical investment"" schemes and Islamic finance, in that the Islamic system does not allow investment that harms people or the environment. He credits the rapid growth of the Islamic finance sector on the success of ""sukuk"" -- Islamic bonds. In the West, banks including Lloyds TSB, HSBC, Deutsche Bank and Citibank all offer Islamic finance products, catering to a niche market of Muslim borrowers. But while Islamic banks allow Muslims to take advantage of financial services that are consistent with their religious beliefs, it is the ethics underpinning Islamic finance that are attracting the interest of conventional finance institutions keen to learn lessons from the banking crisis. Although Islamic banks have suffered from the global repercussions of the economic downturn, they emerged largely unscathed from the initial banking meltdown that brought about that financial turmoil. Ahmed told CNN that is because Islamic banks are not allowed to deal in mortgage-backed securities or credit-default swaps, two of the practices accused of helping bring about the banking crisis. Khorshid said that although it's too early to say if Islamic finance has dealt with economic downturn better than conventional finance, the Islamic system has many more layers of risk assessment and management, which could help protect it from the problems afflicting conventional banks. But the growth of Islamic finance has brought its own problems. Critics say some banks use Islamic finance to package what are essentially conventional products. ""Islamic banks are also driven by the profit motive and sometimes that can dominate the ethics,"" Ahmed told CNN. While Europe is catching up with the demand for these banking products, the U.S. is lagging behind. Ahmed says that regulatory and legal changes are needed for Islamic finance to grow in the U.S., but he adds there are signs that Canada may become a North American center for Islamic finance. The lack of Islamic finance services in the U.S. is reflected in a relative lack of demand for Islamic finance courses, but in the UK there is the opposite problem. With students coming from Asia and the Middle East to get the qualifications that will help them take advantage of the Islamic finance boom, Ahmed says it is difficult for universities to find qualified teaching staff. ""Most people with PhDs in Islamic finance are working in the industry, making a lot of money,"" he told CNN. He added that Islamic finance products have the potential to appeal to the non-Muslims market, pointing out that in Malaysia the majority of customers for Islamic banks aren't Muslims. ""If people look at the principles they'll see something beneficial in terms of economics, rather than just religious reasons. It's a type of ethical finance that may be attractive to a lot of people.""","There is an increase in demand for academic courses in Islamic finance .

"Washington (CNN)  -- Health care reform is a signature issue for Democrats, but the attempt to overhaul the nation's health system has pitted liberals against centrists, exposing fissures 11 months before the 2010 midterm elections. A year ago Democrats were united in victory after winning back the White House and picking up additional seats in Congress. But with victory comes expectations that are accentuated when a party controls both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. For Democrats, it is the party's political base -- voters who turned out in 2008 to help elect Barack Obama president and boost the Democratic majorities in the House and Senate -- which is demanding results. Simply by the numbers, the health care overhaul should easily pass Congress. Democrats comfortably control the House of Representatives, and with the assistance of two Democratic-allied independents have the 60 votes needed to overcome a Republican filibuster in the Senate. Except it is not about numbers on health care. It is about differences in ideology on the public option and abortion that has slowed down the bill. Liberal advocacy organizations wasted little time this week condemning Democratic leaders when news broke that a Senate deal had been struck to replace the public option with another proposal to help cover the uninsured. The deal was intended to address concerns by some centrist Democrats over the public option. The news enraged some liberal activists. MoveOn.org organizers sent a note to the e-mail boxes of its 5 million members. It opened with three words: ""How could they?"" ""Senate Democrats have just announced a tentative health care deal that doesn't appear to include a real public health insurance option,"" the organizers wrote in the note. ""Instead of pulling out all the stops, they've bargained away the heart of health care reform -- allowing conservative senators like Joe Lieberman and Ben Nelson to hold the process hostage and protect Big Insurance."" Lieberman is an independent from Connecticut politically aligned to the Democratic Party. Nelson is a centrist Democrat from Nebraska. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee was more aggressive in its reaction. ""This is outrageous,"" PCCC officials wrote in an e-mail that was sent to 300,000 people. ""We need to fight back now."" The fissures in the Democratic Party do not end at health care. The president's decision to send 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan was met with skepticism by some Democratic lawmakers and outright opposition by others. The decision frustrated anti-war groups. ""In terms of the policy, I think it is a dreadful mistake,"" said former Rep. Tom Andrews, a Maine Democrat who is national director of Win Without War. ""The whole idea of getting out of Afghanistan by escalating is like fighting a fire by throwing gasoline on it."" Some liberals express concern that policy decisions made by the Obama administration and Democratic leaders could hurt the party in the 2010 elections. ""I think the Democratic base -- the danger is it becomes a no-show in 2010,"" Andrews said. ""An element that was so critical to the success in 2006 and 2008 is going to be on the sidelines. People are going to be so dispirited."" Ilyse Hogue, MoveOn.org's director of political advocacy, echoed Andrews' concern and said that while MoveOn.org members ""trust"" Obama, ""they are sincerely concerned about the gap between his campaign promises and the reality of the legislation that is being passed."" ""I think we are going to see, if this trajectory plays out, a depression in 2010 and that is deeply concerning,"" she said. An analysis of CNN polling indicates that support for the president and congressional Democrats has slipped among self-described liberals. In June, a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll showed that Obama had an 89 percent favorable rating with liberals. In December, his favorable rating with this group fell to 73 percent. In October, a CNN/Opinion Research poll showed Democrats had an 87 percent favorable rating with liberals on the generic congressional ballot. It has since dropped to 79 percent. ""From Afghanistan to the public option to abortion to the economy, the past few months have seen President Obama and Democrats in Congress taking actions that some liberals don't like,"" said Keating Holland, CNN's polling director. At the same time, Obama is facing increasing pressure from the Congressional Black Caucus to pay more attention to issues affecting the African-American community. Rep. Barbara Lee, D-California, issued a statement following the president's economic speech this week that prodded him to do as much. ""While we agree with the president that support for small businesses, infrastructure investment and green jobs is essential, we also believe that much more needs to be done, particularly for those Americans who are hurting most,"" said Lee, chairwoman of the caucus. One of the more troubling signs for Democrats, perhaps, is that liberal advocacy groups have been spending money on television ads targeting Democratic lawmakers on health care. After the House approved its health care bill, MoveOn.org ran TV ads against seven Democratic lawmakers criticizing them for voting against it. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee also has run ads against Democrats as has Health Care for America Now, an umbrella group that represents 1,000 organizations, including major unions and liberal-leaning groups. There is even an organization that is trying to recruit liberal candidates to challenge more conservative Democrats in next year's primaries. But for all the talk of Democratic infighting, a senior official at the Democratic National Committee shrugged it off and said disagreements are par for the course when you have a ""big tent"" party. ""What is occurring in the Democratic Party is no different than what always occurs in the Democratic Party,"" said Brad Woodhouse, the DNC communications director. ""It is the most diverse collection of people and ideas of any political party that has walked the face of the earth ... from the very liberal members to the very conservative members. It really is no surprise that when you have such a big and diverse party there are going to be differences.""","Democratic differences on public option, abortion slows down health care overhaul .

"(CNN) -- As U.S. President George W. Bush wrapped up his tour of the Middle East, some of the region's biggest investors were doing business in the U.S. U.S. President George W. Bush during a lighter moment on his Middle Eastern tour with Saudi Prince Salman bin Abdul Aziz . Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal topped up his holding in U.S. banking giant Citigroup, as part of a $12.5 billion cash injection from a group of backers, including the Kuwait Investment Authority. The same day, the Kuwait Investment Authority also participated in a $6.6 billion boost for U.S. investment bank Merrill Lynch. They're the latest in a long line of substantial investments emanating from the Middle East; most made by Sovereign Wealth Funds spending the proceeds of the oil boom. What are they? Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) are not a new phenomenon -- the first was founded in 1953 -- but recently, they've become much more active. In the past six months, in the financial sector alone, they've taken stakes in Morgan Stanley, UBS and Bear Stearns, as well as Citigroup and Merrill Lynch. How much are they worth? Figures vary as many of the larger funds don't divulge valuations. Morgan Stanley says, combined, they could be worth as much as $2.5 trillion. Standard Chartered says the total assets managed in SWFs correspond to around 12 percent of the market capitalization of the NYSE, or about 42 percent of total stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Who owns them? Sovereign Wealth Funds aren't solely the preserve of Middle Eastern royalty. Norway's Government Pension Fund is one of the biggest SWFs in the world, worth an estimated $322 billion. Singapore, China and Russia also have sizeable funds. In fact, they're all featured Standard Chartered's ""Super Seven""; funds with more than $100 billion in assets. In recent years, more countries have jumped aboard the SWF wagon. Among the most recent are Chile's Economic and Social Stabilization Fund (2006) and Venezuela's National Development Fund (2005). Where does the money come from? The biggest single source of funding for the largest SWFs is oil and other commodities. As oil prices swelled, so too did government coffers. Excess foreign reserves are also a source of funding. And of course, as the value of their assets grows, SWFs too will have more money at their disposal. In ten year's time, Standard Chartered estimates they'll be worth $13.4 trillion. Morgan Stanley forecasts a more optimistic $17.5 trillion. Who are the big spenders? The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority is the world's biggest SWF, in dollar value, as well as a proportion of the Emirate's GDP. Estimates of its size vary widely, from $250 billion to $1 trillion. Standard Chartered puts it about half-way at $625 billion. One of its most recent purchases was a $7.5 billion stake in Citigroup last November. Sounds great, what's the catch? Many commentators view the rise of SWFs as a positive force in the world market. For example, while the prospect of a recession in the U.S. has sent other investors running for cover, they've been willing and able to pump vast sums of money into the U.S. banking sector. However, there's some trepidation about their lack of transparency; many don't provide details of their size, investment returns or asset allocation. The secrecy has stoked concerns about their investment motives. Some countries are worried that SWFs will give other governments undue influence over important local companies. The challenge is to ease concerns about ""strategic investments,"" while not setting up too many barriers to foreign money.

"Ishinomaki, Japan (CNN) -- It's been nine months since I took the photos, but as the temperature drops below zero at the start of another Japanese winter, one image stubbornly dwells on my mind. It's not of the tsunami-inflicted destruction -- the flattened homes, mangled cars or piles of debris -- in Ishinomaki, one of the worst-hit areas in the Tohoku region, in the country's north. Instead, it is an image of retirees huddled on small benches outside their temporary homes. The pre-assembled homes have ample heating and are equipped with small kitchens -- and yes, many people in other parts of the world live with much less. But in talking with some of the elderly residents in March, one year after the devastating earthquake and tsunami, it was clear that they were struggling to adapt to their new surroundings. Now as a second winter arrives after March 2011 quake, I was curious as to how these people were coping and I wondered what their thoughts were on Japan's upcoming general election. Did they have a strong preference on who should become Japan's seventh prime minster in just over six years? Or, with so much political change and their own upheaval, were they even paying any attention? I was also compelled by the fact that, according to government figures, more than 320,000 people remain in temporary housing across the affected region. And it could be the case for quite some time. According to a recent report in The Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper, of the nearly 24,000 housing units set to be constructed in three prefectures, only roughly 13,700 will be completed by March of 2015. That's four years after the tsunami hit. And with this all in mind, it's particularly tough for many people in the Tohoku region to grasp the concept of the revolving door of leaders, as they watch the reconstruction drag on. Junko Hino, a resident at one housing center, told us, ""Nothing has changed here, but the prime minister has changed many times. I don't understand the meaning of any of it."" Sixty-seven-year-old Katsuji Ogata lost his wife in the tsunami. He used to run a small restaurant in Ishinomaki. Now it's a simple food truck. He is even more outspoken, saying ""the government hasn't done a thing for us. They've only cleared the debris."" Kenichi Kurosawa erected a sign it what was once a neighborhood that reads Ganbaru, or ""try your hardest,"" in the hope of inspiring those who are struggling in the aftermath of the tsunami. He says, ""I know it was a huge disaster and things would take time. But I am frustrated. The reaction has been too slow for too long. We are working hard and trying to move forward, but there are many people who are really struggling and need some help."" The people in the housing complexes are making the best of their situation though. One we visited outside Ishinomaki had setup a small Sunday morning market the day we visited. They were also operating a basic convenience store. And we also met Satoshi Sakurai at the complex's barber shop. ""Another prime minster and another new cabinet, the reconstruction will be delayed again,"" he sighs. But the barber shop's owner, Hiroshi Yokota, tried to keep things in perspective. ""I sometimes wish I'd wake, and it was all a dream,"" he says. ""But it happened to us, so we make the best of situation, and try to get back to the life we once had.""","Elderly residents in Ishinomaki are struggling to adapt to post-tsunami surroundings .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Shinzo Abe, Japan's one-time prime minister, may get a second chance at the job. After serving as the country's leader from 2006 to 2007, his Liberal Democratic Party looks set to return to power this weekend in national elections. Some investors believe the second coming of Abe will be good for Japan's equity markets. ""Investors are pricing in...much greater monetary easing,"" said Ben Collett, head of Japanese equities at Louis Capital Markets in Hong Kong. In mid-November, Abe called for unlimited monetary easing to jumpstart the economy. He also urged the Bank of Japan to raise its current 1% inflation goal to as much as 3%. Since then, investors betting on an Abe administration have pushed the Tokyo Nikkei up by more than 10%. Still, Collett doubts if Abe can deliver on his calls for more stimulus and thinks investors might not see action. ""That's just talk to get into office. He's putting a line in the sand. I don't know how he achieves it."" If anything, Collett believes Abe's timing is ""quite fortuitous"" and that Japan's economy has ""hit bottom"" and is ready to bounce back. And if Abe returns to office, he is expected to push back harder against a rising China than his predecessors, if his previous assertive leadership style is anything to go by. Asia's first and second largest economies have been embroiled in a months-long trade dispute because of rival territorial claims in the East China Sea. Both China and Japan lay claim to a small grouping of islands, known as the Diaoyu Islands in Chinese and the Senkaku Islands in Japanese. On September 11, Japan nationalized the islands causing an uproar in China. In retaliation, Chinese consumers slowed their purchases of Japanese products. In October, Japan revealed its September exports to China fell more than 14%. A stronger stance against China may rattle trade ties even more, Collett said. And that may also weaken Japan's currency, the yen. ""In fact, Abe's comments may be intentionally aimed at destabilizing sentiment on the yen,"" Collett added, noting that ""anything that removes popularity of the yen as a safe haven"" will be good for exporters. Japan's economy relies heavily on exporters -- big-name brands that include well-known names Toyota, Sony and Panasonic. A weaker currency means Japan's exporters earn more yen when they repatriate overseas profits back to Japan. Since mid-November, the yen has weakened 5.2% as Abe's chances of returning to power have risen. Still, while many economists are becoming more bearish about Japan's economy, which has just slipped into recession, Collett remains bullish. ""Japan has never looked better to me. I'm very, very optimistic on it,"" Collett said. ""I'm hopeful for the market and the economy and Abe's timing is solid."" ""He'll initiate a cycle of new industrial development -- a rebirth of heavy industry in Japan that includes energy, hi-tech, space exploration and defense industries.""","Some investors believe second coming of Shinzo Abe will be good for Japan equity markets .

"(CNN) -- Over the course of five days, the Greek government -- led by the understated conservative Prime Minister Antonis Samaras -- overcame two high hurdles in a dash to qualify for the austerity program set out by the so-called troika, made up of the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission. The first hurdle was the parliamentary vote last week, when the austerity measures were passed by just 153 votes out of 300. The second important vote took place in the wee hours of Sunday night in Athens, this time with a comfortable margin of victory as 167 of 300 lawmakers voted for, in essence, more austerity. But in the spirit of a Greek tragedy, much political blood has been spilt along the way. Those who voted against the measures were tossed out of the coalition parties, while members of the Democratic Left abstained due to the labor reforms that were built into the overall plan. This has been a very messy process, with the troika leaning on the relatively new government to deliver what Greece had promised before the current administration came to power following the elections last June. In large part, the restructuring is now there and Greece is telling the troika: ""Show me the money."" The implicit agreement on the table: Greece delivers another $17 billion in cuts over two years from labor reforms and tops that off with a new 2013 budget. The troika then puts up the final instalment of $40 billion to avoid defaulting on bonds which start coming due November 16. But all of a sudden, there seems to be disagreement in the ranks and backlash from some eurozone member countries not happy with the measures. As one Greek CEO messaged me last night after our coverage of the vote: ""We kept our side of the bargain; we need to see delivery from the other side too."" The budget for 2013 makes for painful reading. A projected contraction of 4.5% next year and a record sixth year of recession, with the economy shrinking more than 30% in that time frame. Public debt to GDP is due to increase to 189%, having risen more than 50% since this whole crisis started. Unemployment last week hit a record 25.4% with youth unemployment leaping to 58%. Another Greek executive I spoke with last night after the vote said the population has entered a new phase of acceptance. State workers have taken salary and pension cuts ranging from 15% to 40%, taxes on electric bills have soared, the retirement age has been bumped up to 67 years from 65 years. Finally, the real shrinking of the state sector is taking place. The state payroll will fall by 125,000 between 2012 and 2016 through attrition and real layoffs. Some of the special pay packages for certain ministries, such as the Ministry of Finance, have been eliminated and salaries have been capped. Some 40 senior employees at the Bank of Greece, the central bank, walked off the job for good in protest of the 5,000 euro salary cap. Change was a long time coming, but it has happened. This is a critical time. Some 70,000 workers took to the streets in central Greece last week for one last fight of resistance against the austerity. Samaras said it was a vote ""for"" or ""against"" the isolation of Greece. He was suggesting that Greeks will soon see the flickering light at the end of the tunnel, with the full backing of German Chancellor Angela Merkel after her recent, high profile public show of support in Athens. Political statements may be offered by the members of the eurozone this week, something the Greek technocratic Finance Minister Yiannis Stournaras promised. One thing is abundantly clear at this stage. For the state workers who have taken salary hits and for the one million private sector workers who have lost their jobs due to economic depression: The cash lifeline needs to be delivered.","The Greek government has overcome two hurdles to qualify for the troika's austerity program .

"(CNN) -- Former South African President Nelson Mandela will remain in a Pretoria hospital through Christmas, the government said on Monday. In a statement on his website, President Jacob Zuma said that Mandela is responding well to treatment. ""We also humbly invite all freedom loving people around the world to pray for him. He is an ardent fighter and will recover from this episode with all our support,'' said Zuma, who visited Mandela on Saturday. Mandela, 94, has received round-the-clock care since an acute respiratory infection in 2011. He was hospitalized for a lung infection on December 8; and on December 15, he had successful endoscopic surgery to have gallstones removed. Mandela has not appeared in public since the 2010 World Cup hosted by South Africa. The Nobel Peace Prize winner spent 27 years in prison for fighting the oppression of blacks in South Africa. He became the nation's first black president in 1994, four years after he was freed.

"Buchanan, New York (CNN) -- The chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission got a firsthand look Tuesday at the Indian Point nuclear plant on a visit organized by two members of Congress from New York who want the plant shut down. Chairman Gregory Jaczko toured the plant with longtime Indian Point opponents Rep. Nita Lowey and Rep. Elliot Engel, who have been raising concerns about the safety of the plant following the earthquake and tsunami in Japan that seriously damaged the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. ""As I have repeatedly stressed to (plant owner) Entergy and the NRC, I continue to have serious concerns about several specific issues related to Indian Point,"" Lowey said at a press conference following the tour. Indian Point is on the Hudson River, 35 miles north of midtown Manhattan. Among the chief concerns raised by Lowey and Engel is the feasibility of evacuating such a populated area in the event of an emergency. Currently the NRC requires plants to have plans in place to evacuate a 10-mile radius around their facilities. But, pointing out that the NRC urged Americans within a 50-mile radius of the damaged Japanese reactors to leave, Lowey said that ""evacuating 20 million people within a 50-mile radius of Indian Point would be a near-impossibility."" ""The bottom line,"" said Engel after the tour, ""I still believe Indian Point should be closed."" Jaczko said the visit was a good opportunity to hear firsthand from the representatives about their concerns. ""I think it's so important that we continue to have a very open and transparent dialogue,"" he said. Asked whether the proximity of the plant to such a densely populated area was sufficient reason to close the plant, as many New York officials have argued, including Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Jaczko said he couldn't comment since Indian Point is undergoing a formal relicensing effort right now. There are two reactors at Indian Point. One is due to be relicensed in 2013 and the other in 2015. Jaczko said the agency closely monitors the operation of all nuclear facilities ""to ensure that they meet our very stringent safety and security requirements."" Indian Point, he said, meets those requirements. Lowey and Engel have introduced a bill that would require the NRC to use the same standards it uses to license new nuclear plants when relicensing older plants, ""including evaluating terror threats, seismic risk, population density and evacuation concerns,"" Lowey said. Engel, who first called for the plant to be closed following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, said, ""If this plant were being built today, in 2011, I can tell you it would not be sited here in Buchanan, New York."" Lowey said new data showing that Indian Point is located at two fault lines means the NRC should also evaluate whether a seismic event could affect the power supply or cause the spent fuel pools to leak. Jaczko said as part of relicensing, the NRC looks at the seismic qualifications of plants to ensure that all systems will continue to operate safely. A task force of ""top-notch experts"" at the agency is looking at all the challenges and issues that emerged following the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, he said. ""I expect that we'll learn some good lessons, and I expect there will be some changes to our requirements as a result of that,"" he said.","2 New York members of Congress want nuclear plant closed .
