It was the kind of wish list that a couple of young teenagers might make before heading off on a summer camping trip. Included in it was strawberry jam, Nutella chocolate spread, baby oil, Nivea moisturiser, croissants, Pringles crisps, hair removal cream and a pack of cards. In a sign that the reality of the trouble they are in hadn’t quite set in, ‘Peru Two’ Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly munched pizza as they wrote out items that they’d like brought to them to make their lives a little easier. Scroll down for video . Wishlist: 'Peru Two' Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly wrote out this list of items that they'd like brought to them to make their lives easier . Locked up: British girls Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly are suspected of smuggling cocaine . The list was given to Melissa’s father Billy on Monday night but before he could buy any of the goods, the women were charged with drugs trafficking and moved from their relatively comfortable cell at a Lima police station to a ‘horrific’ one beneath a courthouse, with no access to food or bedding. The British women claim they were kidnapped while on holiday in Ibiza and forced by armed Colombian gangsters to fly to  Peru as drugs mules. Yesterday they appeared before a judge for the first time and were asked why they had posed with a Peruvian police officer in a photograph – and not asked him for help – if they had been kidnapped. If found guilty of drug trafficking, the women face up to 15 years in jail. Peru’s penal authority says 1,648 foreigners are currently in its prisons on drug trafficking charges, 31 of them British citizens. Hearing: The pair look on as a lawyer speaks at a court at the Justice Court of Callao. They are suspected of smuggling £1.5million worth of cocaine out of Peru . Worried: The pair looked glum and drawn as they were led away in handcuffs through the back of the court to a holding cell . Melissa and Michaella, both 20, were . arrested at Lima airport as they checked in for a flight to Madrid on . August 6, with £1.5million of cocaine in their suitcases. They . looked tired and daunted  as they sat side-by-side, in handcuffs, next . to their solicitor Meyer Fishman at the superior court in Callao . yesterday. A lawyer for the prosecution said they did not believe the women were forced to smuggle the drugs because, by their own declaration, ‘they had many chances to ask for help’. Michaella McCollum, 20, wipes a tear as she listens to Peruvian Judge Dilo Huaman at the Callao courtroom . He also pointed to the photographs on Melissa’s camera which showed them doing tourist activities in Lima and Cuzco – in particular a picture in which they allegedly posed with a police officer. He said the prosecution felt they had not told the truth in police interviews, adding that CCTV near their hotel in Lima did not show them with anyone else. The hotel manager also claimed they were alone. The judge asked the women  why they had not asked for help at the airport, to which they responded – through their translator – that they were worried  and scared and did not know  who they could trust or who was watching them. The women spent the past two weeks in a cell beneath Dirandro police station, where they could see their families twice a day. The Mail was even able to take them McDonald’s meals, cake, clothing, chewing gum and a Spanish phrase book. But yesterday, reality hit when they found themselves in a ‘dirty’ cramped cell beneath the court at Callao. After their appearance in court they were remanded in custody to the same cell. They will stay there until they are moved to a women’s prison – most likely the notorious Santa Monica jail – where they will stay for the next few months, or even years, while they wait for their case to be heard. Michaella’s lawyer, Peter Madden, told the Mail: ‘They are in a windowless cage on their own. They have no bedding and they have not been given any food. I have asked for them to be given mattresses or I will go and buy some. ‘Their mood has changed. They are both very shaken and upset.’","Melissa Reid and Michaella .

"By . Larisa Brown . UPDATED: . 09:06 EST, 16 January 2012 . Transvestite: Jamie Love claims he was asked to leave Govan High School because he came in dressed as a girl . A teenage boy claims he was thrown out from a notoriously rough high school after turning up to class dressed as a girl. Jamie Love, 17, arrived at Govan High School wearing tights, mini-shorts, a high-waisted belt, hair extensions and make-up - shortly before he was ordered to leave. Jamie, a dancer, who asked schoolmates to call him Keirny, claims he was speaking to teachers for months about how he felt trapped in a boy’s body. He plucked up the courage to face his classmates as a girl on Monday - despite being taunted by some pupils for his outward feminity. The sixth-former, who is ‘known by everybody in Govan’ and has predominately female friends, was last night described as a very ‘brave’ boy. Jamie said: ‘It took me years to finally open up to someone about my sexuality and now I feel betrayed by the people I trusted. ‘I have always felt different but I have never been able to talk about it. ‘I left the school in tears feeling totally humiliated and embarrassed.’ The schoolboy, who is from Govan, in Glasgow, said he told the school in advance of his plans to attend class as a girl - a claim the school denies. But on the first day he turned up dressed like all of his female friends, he was allegedly told to pack up his things and leave. Jamie - who likes to wear blonde, brown and blue long hair extensions - said the school knew about his need to express himself as a woman. He added: ‘I was very nervous about going to school as a girl but I thought I had the support of the school.’ Yet during the first period at school a teacher came into the class and escorted him to the head teacher’s office. ‘The two deputy heads asked me, ""What are you trying to do to this school?"" They told me to get my stuff and not come back.’ But the school strenuously denies all claims that Jamie was asked to leave school because of his clothing. Glasgow City Council said Jamie was told to move on because of his lack of commitment to education. While Jamie admits he has behavioural problems and has been disruptive in the past because of his confusion over his sexuality, both he and his mother Alison, 45, insist his cross-dressing was the focus of their discussions with the school. He was in the middle of a hairdressing course in the sixth-form at the school and had hoped to gain enough qualifications for a place at Central College in Glasgow. His mother said: ‘Jamie has done nothing wrong here. He has every right to express himself the way he wants and I will stand by him.’ Make up: Jamie says he has battled with his gender identity for years and the confusion it has caused him led to disruptive behaviour at school . Jamie broke the news to his mother only six weeks ago that he wanted to start dressing as a woman. She said: ‘At first I was horrified and shocked that my only son would want to be a girl but once we had a long talk, I realised that it was something he had to do. He has been bottling it up for years. ‘But I have accepted him for who he is. Why can’t the school?’ His sister Michaela, 19, said: ‘People turn up to school wearing trackies, trainers and polos and they don’t get told to leave.’ Support: Jamie with his mother, Alison, left, and sister, Michaela, right. He broke the news to his mother only six weeks ago that he wanted to start dressing as a woman . As he was: Jamie's school denies that he was asked to leave because of his decision to dress as a girl . A Glasgow City Council spokesman said: ‘Jamie was not expelled and is still on the school roll. 'The suggestion the pupil was told he was not welcome at the school because of his clothing is completely untrue. ‘He did not speak to us about the way he wanted to dress, however, his choice of clothing is not an issue and he was not told it was inappropriate. ‘He was advised on Monday that school was no longer meeting his needs and he should move on, and that staff would continue to support him. ‘However, he appears to want to continue at school. 'It’s therefore important that we put measures in place to accommodate Jamie’s choice of clothing and the school would like to meet him and his mother, along with relevant support agencies, to discuss these and be clear on expectations so he can come back to school in a positive and supportive climate.’",Govan High School denies the pupil was thrown out because of his decision to dress as a girl .

A 37-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of child abduction . The distraught family of a  13-year-old girl who went missing  after befriending an older man over the internet begged her last night to come home. Erika Kacicova’s father Stefan said his ‘beautiful’ daughter had got to know a man of Pakistani origin on Facebook before disappearing a week ago. On Friday, police arrested a 22-year-old man from Bradford on suspicion of abduction. He was released on bail yesterday, with police describing his relationship with the girl as ‘a friendship’. They said the man, who approached them after they issued an appeal for information about Erika’s whereabouts, was still ‘of interest’ to the inquiry. Erika was last seen on Monday afternoon when she left her family’s home in Darnall, Sheffield. Police have been conducting house-to-house inquiries in the city and have extended their search to Bradford. One line of inquiry is that Erika may be staying with friends there. Detectives are following up a number of possible sightings. Detective Inspector Helen Tate, from South Yorkshire Police, said: ‘There is nothing that has come to light which leads us to believe she is further afield than that. We do feel she is somewhere within the South and West Yorkshire region.’ Officers described the incident as ‘critical’ and appealed to Erika to get in touch to say that she is safe and well. Erika Kacicova's father Stefan (pictured here with his other daughter Bozena, ten) said his 'beautiful' daughter had got to know a man of Pakistani origin on Facebook before disappearing a week ago . Erika was last seen on Monday afternoon when she left her family's home in Darnall, Sheffield . Erika’s father said last night: ‘She has been gone for six days now and we have not had any phone calls or texts from her. ‘She is a beautiful, normal girl who loves her music and dancing and we miss her.’ Mr Kacicova, an unemployed former parking attendant who lives with his wife Jana and Erika’s younger sister, Bozena, ten, said the teenager had met the unnamed man online. ‘I am very angry at this man. My daughter is just a child and he should not have been speaking to her,’ he said. ‘Now I am just begging him to please tell us where she is so that she can come home. ‘It is very hard to stop children from going on the computer and we did not know that Erika had been speaking so much with this man. She is a good girl and we want her to know that we all love her and care for her very much.’ The family moved to Britain from Slovakia two years ago. [caption . Detectives have taken a computer and a mobile phone from their home for further analysis. Erika previously went missing about three months ago but she returned home after 24 hours. Detective Inspector Tate said: ‘This is out of character for her. She is a 13-year-old girl and she has not been missing like this before for such a period of time. ‘I really do need you, Erika, to get in touch with the police and let us know you’re safe.’ She said of the 22-year-old man: ‘It is a friendship, and I can’t say anything more than that, but he has been released on bail and is still of interest to us.’ She added: ‘Erika’s not in trouble. There’s nothing that she’s done wrong. ‘She’s a schoolgirl and there are no issues there. We really do just want her to come home and make sure that she’s safe. ‘The family quite naturally are distraught. They are very troubled by the whole situation. ‘They desire to know their daughter is safe and well.’ A neighbour of the Kacicovas, who requested to remain anonymous, said: ‘She is a lovely girl and we would often see her around. ‘It is very worrying that she has been missing for such a long time and we really feel for her family and hope she comes home soon.’ Erika’s photograph has been circulated to police officers and CCTV operators in the hope that she can be traced. She is 4ft 11in, slim, with long, straight dark brown hair and brown eyes, and was wearing blue jeans, a pink polo-style shirt and a silvery-grey jacket.

"By . Ruby Warrington . PUBLISHED: . 16:00 EST, 10 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:07 EST, 10 August 2013 . I am lying on my back in a field amid hundreds of people in stretchy Lycra clothing at the Wanderlust yoga festival in Vermont – imagine a mini Glastonbury, but with added headstands. And there are tears streaming down my face. The class I’ve just finished was titled Radiant Body: Your Practise As Medicine. But if I was expecting a practical guide to easing physical aches and pains, it’s evidently aimed more at emotional therapy. Moments earlier, when the teacher asked us to visualise an area of our life that needed healing, a vivid impression of the ex-boyfriend I hadn’t thought about for years appeared in my mind, and with it a profound realisation that I never properly dealt with the fallout from that destructive relationship. Mind over mats: A mass yoga class at a previous Wanderlust festival - far from the muddy rock events of the UK . The waterworks began when we moved into a deeper stretch and it became obvious that getting over it once and for all would mean practising some forgiveness and gratitude – it was time to forgive myself for allowing it to happen, and to thank him for showing me what I didn’t want from a relationship. Yoga originated in India, but has become mainstream. And much to the distaste of the purists, all sorts of styles of yoga have been developed to suit different bodies and tastes. It means there is a class  for everyone now. I have always approached yoga from a purely athletic standpoint, seeing it mainly as an opportunity for a good stretch. But on my mat in Vermont, I experience a yogic awakening. So this is the mind, body and spirit effect that people talk about. And judging from the sobs and sniffles on the mats around me, I’m not the only one. The Wanderlust festival (wander . lustfestival.com), now in its third year, travels to six different sites . in the United States during the summer (it also went to Chile this . year), and is an example of how mainstream yoga has become in America. Mind bent: Ruby Warrington has fallen for traditional yoga after attending Wanderlust . It’s estimated that 20 million people in the States now regularly hit the mat, while spending on yoga related products reached £17 billion last year – up 87 per cent in five years. In the UK, as many as a million people regularly do yoga, and September is National Yoga Month when more than 2,200 studios will offer a week of free trial classes. There are myriad studies to show yoga can help with everything from osteoarthritis and asthma to stress and chronic lower back pain. It has also been proven to be useful during pregnancy and labour, and in improving cognitive function and perceived stress during the menopause. Not to mention the lengthening, tightening effect it has on your body. A photographer who specialises in nudes once told me that without doubt, the best bodies she saw naked were the yoga bodies. If I was expecting a dreadlocked crowd of blissed-out hippies, the Vermont event seemed mainly to attract affluent New Yorkers decked out in trendy yoga label Lululemon Athletica (which plans to launch in the UK later this year). I even ate lunch next to a couple who had brought a nanny to watch the kids while they took back-to-back classes. Meanwhile, my lunch might have been a vegan, gluten-free pizza, but evening entertainment also included ‘Winederlust’ – a bar serving organic and biodynamic wine – and a lavish, four-course ‘farm-to-table’ feast (with steak and home-made limoncello), tickets for which cost $85 each and sold out way ahead. As for my teary experience on the mat, once the floodgates had opened, I could barely get through a class without crying. Take the Detox Flow Yoga session, taught by a woman many regard  as the high priestess of yoga, Seane Corn. As she lectured a 400-strong class of mildly hung-over yogis about how we often use alcohol and other substances as an emotional crutch, it became very clear I do exactly that – and that my love affair with booze began when I needed Dutch courage to extricate myself from the aforementioned bad romance. Cue more waterworks. My favourite kind of yoga has always been Bikram, the insanely hot class that makes you sweat buckets and gives you muscles like Popeye, because to me it felt like a ‘proper’ workout. But after my weekend of healing, I can finally see the point of more gentle, breathing-focused schools of yoga. The following weekend, feeling nostalgic for summertime back the UK, my husband and I catch up with friends who regale us with tales of the rock festivals they’ve been to. But I can’t stop thinking about a very different kind of festival – and what feels like only the beginning  of my yogic journey. Iyengar: Suitable for all ages and abilities and uses equipment such as foam blocks and straps. Improves balance and body strength; a study of 90 people with chronic lower-back pain found less disability,  pain and depression after six months. Ashtanga: Fast- moving, demanding yoga comprising six sequences of poses, which become progressively harder – participants advance as their skill develops. Each pose is linked with one breath. Said to develop cardiovascular fitness and body strength. A small study of children found they lost weight and felt less anxiety after 12 weeks of ashtanga yoga. Kundalini: The ‘yoga  of awareness’, it combines breathing exercises, postures, chanting mantras and meditation. Focus on relaxation and self-awareness. Bikram: A class in a sauna-like room where attendees go twice through a series of 26 postures. Said to burn up to 600 calories a class.  A 2012 study discovered that bikram was associated with better sleep, while other research found it increased strength and flexibility and decreased weight. Hatha: An umbrella  term – Hatha means a gentle, traditional approach with basic postures, meditation and breathing exercises. Cuts stress, improves breathing and builds back strength.",Fitness columnist Ruby Warrington attends Wanderlust yoga festival .

A possible successor to disgraced San Diego mayor Bob Filner, 70, who resigned on Friday after weeks of allegations of sexual harassment, has also been accused of inappropriate sexual behavior. According to investigative website Voice of OC, Republican ex-councilman Carl DeMaio, 38, has been caught on multiple occasions leaving meetings and masturbating in restrooms at work. DeMaio's spokesman Dave McCulloch has categorically denied that any such behavior took place and accused his political opponents of dirty tactics. 'It is absurd and ludicrous. It is absolutely ludicrous to report on something like this in the first place,' McCulloch told the site on Thursday. Allegations: Republican Carl DeMaio, 38, has been accused of leaving meetings and masturbating in restrooms at work caught on multiple occasions. The ex-councilman is thought to be considering a run for San Diego mayor . Disgraced: Bob Filner resigned as San Diego mayor on Friday after weeks of pressure and allegations of sexual harassment from nearly 20 women . The Voice of OC reported that in 2009 Democrat Ben Hueso, San Diego council president at the time, twice walked in on DeMaio masturbating. He claims that he walked in on his colleague engaging in the inappropriate act in front of a urinal with his pants round his ankles. Hueso, 52, said: 'DeMaio was masturbating. He . jumped, caught by surprise. He jumped to the sink … saying 'I'm sorry, . I'm sorry' about six times. Then washed his hands, darted out.' Councilwoman Marti Emerald confirmed this version of events, claiming she saw Hueso outside the restroom just after the incident. 'Ben . was in a state of shock, face red, eyes bulging,' Emerald explained . 'I said: ‘You look like you just saw the devil?' He said: . ‘DeMaio is masturbating in the middle of the room.' Emerald told the Voice of OC that 'everyone' at the council knew of the rumors. Others suggest that tales of DeMaio's alleged behavior became a joke at San Diego City Hall. Shock? Democrat Ben Hueso, San Diego council president at the time, claims he twice walked in on DeMaio masturbating . The openly gay DeMaio is currently running . for Congress but thought to be once again considering challenging for mayor. DeMaio lost the mayor's election to Filner in November 2012. There were some attempts by journalists to report the story but nothing was published. Hueso, now a state senator, claims he didn't want to file a complaint against the powerful DeMaio, while Emerald had not personally witnessed anything that could be reported. Spokesmen for DeMaio have strongly denied the allegations. 'There is no other way to respond to this than to call it what it is: a lie,' Jason Roe told The Daily Caller. 'If . Ben Hueso started this rumor,' spokesman Roe continued, 'he embarrasses himself and . our great city. This is exactly the kind of gutter politics that has . lead to the dysfunction of our political system in San Diego and . Washington, D.C.' Well-known: According to the allegations, DeMaio's behavior was known by 'everyone' at San Diego City Council offices (pictured) Roe added: 'Ben Hueso and his union allies ignored Bob Filner's . serial sexual harassment to keep Carl from winning the mayor's race and . now he's manufacturing a lie to stop Carl's momentum.' DeMaio's spokesman McCulloch told Voice of OC there had been a large campaign waged against him in last November's mayoral election, where DeMaio was beaten by Filner. 'A . whole lot of money was spent to paint Carl in a bad light,' said . McCulloch. 'If this allegation was at all serious, or actually true, . this would have been exposed.' The Daily Caller reported on Friday that a spokeswoman for Hueso did not dispute the accuracy of his words in the Voice of OC article. Challenge: DeMaio (picture) who lost the mayoral election to Bob Filner in November 2012 may now take another attempt at the job . Filner resigned as mayor on Friday after weeks of pressure and allegations of sexual harassment from nearly 20 women. DeMaio is reportedly considering challenging again for the now vacant post. As reported by CBS, he has discussed a mayoral campaign with supporters and community leaders who want him to run. 'We're all focused on healing, coming together as a city and getting back to basic city business,' he added.","Former San Diego council president Ben Hueso claims he twice walked in on Carl DeMaio masturbating in men's room .

"By . Martin Beckford . PUBLISHED: . 15:56 EST, 24 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:59 EST, 25 August 2013 . Accused: Winston Roddick, allegedly listed his brother's address as his home instead of his house in Cardiff . Two of Britain’s controversial crime tsars face being stripped of their titles after being investigated for electoral fraud, which could trigger by-elections costing taxpayers as much as £3.6 million. The Mail on Sunday can reveal  that the police watchdog mounted covert operations after being tipped off that the Police and Crime Commissioners for North Wales and Hampshire allegedly lied about where they lived. The two PCCs could face prosecution for election fraud offences if the Independent Police Complaints Commission decides they were not based inside their force area on polling day, as the law required. Winston Roddick is accused of listing his brother’s house in Caernarfon as his address when he really lives on the other side of Wales in Cardiff, and Simon Hayes is said  to spend time in a Northamptonshire village with his vicar wife while having claimed he lived just outside Southampton. If both men were charged with breaching electoral legislation and then found guilty, they would be kicked out of their posts. Both are independents with no political party backing, and neither has appointed a deputy so far, so local councillors would be forced to choose unelected members of the PCCs’ staff as temporary replacements, in what critics say would make a mockery of Ministers’ promise that the new crime tsars would improve police accountability. But then fresh elections would have to be held, at further cost to voters who for the most part ignored last year’s nationwide poll. Bernard Rix, a consultant who monitors PCCs’ activity, said last night: ‘This is a further unwelcome cost to the taxpayer.’ And Tal Michael, who stood for Labour in North Wales, added: ‘The implications if a commissioner is found guilty of electoral fraud  are that we will need to have  another costly election the public don’t want.’ The unprecedented allegations against the . two politicians represent the deepest crisis yet for PCCs, introduced . just nine months ago in a £75 million nationwide poll that saw a record . low turnout of just 15 per cent of voters. Doubled-up: Mr Roddick has listed his brother's house, left, in Caernarfon as his home, but has allegedly been living in a housein Cardiff, right, for 20 years . Many commissioners have been accused of cronyism by giving well-paid roles to friends and political allies, while some have faced questions over their expenses. The IPCC police watchdog has the power to look into allegations of potentially criminal misconduct against crime tsars, and the PCCs  in North Wales and Hampshire are the first to face the possibility of criminal charges over their conduct at the time of the ballot. The law that introduced PCCs – who have the power to set force budgets and strategies, as well to hire and fire chief constables – makes it clear that candidates must live in the police force area in which they stand. They had to be on the relevant electoral roll both on the day they were nominated and on polling day, November 15. The Electoral Commission said candidates were warned it is an offence to lie on their nomination forms, but no independent checks were made into the information given. Mr Roddick, a 72-year-old barrister, listed his address in his election literature as being in the historic coastal town of Caernarfon, within the North Wales police area. But electoral roll and Land Registry records show his main home  for more than 20 years has been 175 miles away in Cardiff, South Wales. The Caernarfon house is owned by his brother and sister-in-law. Wrong address? Simon Hayes claims he lives at a Hampshire home but has been staying 115 miles away . Second homes probe: Hampshire PCC Haynes has allegedly been living with his vicar wife in Earls Barton, Northamptonshire . Earlier this summer the IPCC was told that Mr Roddick, who earns £70,000 a year as PCC, had given a false address, and began a secret operation to investigate the homes without his knowledge. Mr Roddick declined to comment yesterday, despite repeated calls to his home, office, staff and his brother. Meanwhile a similar accusation has been levelled at Mr Hayes, a former Conservative councillor who won the PCC ballot in Hampshire  as an independent and who is paid £85,000 a year. He has worked in the county for many years, previously owned a house there and gave his address as a house in the small town of Bishop’s Waltham. But he does not own it, although he has been staying there. Mr Hayes’s wife, Miranda, is a vicar in the Northants village of Earls Barton, 115 miles away, and it has been alleged that he actually lives with her. A complaint was made to the Hampshire Police and Crime Panel, which scrutinises the performance of PCCs, and passed on to the IPCC. Exposed: Previous spotlight on crime tsars . The Mail on Sunday has led the way in exposing the waste of public money and questionable decisions made by PCCs. We revealed that many PCCs were creating a ‘gravy train’ by giving posts to friends and political allies, and were also holding down second jobs in councils and businesses. Teenage Paris Brown was forced to quit her £15,000 role as the first youth PCC after the MoS uncovered a series of offensive online comments. And Thames Valley PCC  Anthony Stansfeld had to repay ‘incorrectly claimed’ travel expenses after our exposé. In another twist, the man Mr Hayes defeated to win the poll – former Conservative MP Michael Mates – is also under investigation for allegedly lying about his address.Police have been looking into claims that Mr Mates, who famously gave  a watch to disgraced tycoon Asil Nadir inscribed ‘Don’t let the buggers get you down’, was living in West Sussex when he stood as PCC. Last night, Mr Hayes told The  Mail on Sunday: ‘I am content that I completed the nomination form correctly. There is an accusation which is being investigated by the IPCC. I am quite content that it is being investigated.’ Once the IPCC has completed its investigations, a senior commissioner will decide whether to pass the file to the Crown Prosecution Service. In the event that either  Mr Roddick or Mr Hayes was charged with election fraud and convicted, they would be declared ineligible to be PCCs. The law states that if a PCC is ‘incapacitated’, the local panel can choose a member of their staff as an ‘acting commissioner’. But the local election would then have to be held again. The 41 polls across England and Wales last year cost £75 million, so holding two again could cost as much as £3.6 million. An IPCC spokesman confirmed  it was investigating both PCCs, adding: ‘We have received a referral and are at the early stages of an investigation. We are unable to comment further at this stage.’ Jacqui Rayment, who stood as a for Labour in Hampshire, said: ‘The cost of another election on the grounds of misconduct from the standing PCC would be hard to stomach.’ She added that it would nevertheless be wrong to appoint a member of the PCC’s staff without any discussion.","Winston Roddick listed his brother’s house in Caernarfon as his address .

When most of us go to the beach, the best souvenir we can hope for is sand in our shoes and maybe a shell or two. But for one little boy it was a little more exciting when a snail emerged from his knee following a trip to the beach. Four year-old Paul Franklin from Aliso Viejo in Orange County, was left baffled when the small creature appeared after his mother Rachael decided to squeeze his wounded knee which he had grazed after falling on rocks during a family camping holiday. Four year-old Paul (center) was stunned when his mother Rachel (left) squeezed his graze and the snail popped out. Little brother Luke (right), two, is excited about the new addition to the family which the boys have named Turbo . At first, Rachael didn't think much of the injury which Paul sustained while on holiday with his family in Spooner's Cove, California. 'It was just a little owie,' she told the Orange County Register. 'But one that kept seeping and never quite scabbed up.' After cleaning the wound with antibiotic liquid and applying a small bandage, she didn't think any more of it. But a week later, Paul managed to re-open the cut after falling while ice skating. Soon, his knee became red, swollen and hot to touch. Doctors told Rachael that it was a staph infection, and took samples from Paul's knee tissue to test  for dangerous viruses. The doctor prescribed a heavy dose of antibiotics,and sent them on their way. Ten days later the scab was looking much better, and Rachael thought she could put the ordeal behind her. It was only when Paul fell on his knee again that his mother knew something was wrong. Filled with what looked like black puss, she decided the wound needed draining. 'I know the doctors didn't want to drain it, but that sucker needed draining!' she said. The small sea snail is thought to have made its way into Paul's knee after he fell on a nest of snail eggs at Spooner's Cove beach. Paul's mother Rachael is now looking for marine biologists who will be able to tell her more . To Rachel's surprise, what emerged when she squeezed the graze was not just oozing discharge, but a little black snail. At first, she and Paul mistook the tiny creature for a rock, only realizing that it was in fact a small sea snail when they saw something moving inside its hard shell. Paul's father, Ken, believes the little animal made its way into his son's leg after he fell onto a nest of snail's eggs at the beach in Spooner's Cove. Rachael is now trying to find marine biologists who will be able to tell her how such a turn of events came about. Paul, who describes the whole incident as ""crazy"" has since named the snail Turbo. It now lives in a small fishbowl with the family's other pet, a beta fish called Dory.","Paul Franklin, 4, found the animal in his knee three weeks after falling on rocks during a family holiday .

Known from television and radio . appearances as the ‘dog whisperer’, Mugford spends his life surrounded . by vicious canines, as  he tames them for their wealthy owners, . including royalty. You imagine a pack of slavering hounds patrolling his grounds. Alpha dog: Animal psychologist Roger Mugford and his dogs have made the 19th century mansion in Chertsey, Surrey their home . So it’s a surprise when I arrive at . his country house outside Chertsey, Surrey, to find dog behaviourist . Mugford with only a deaf, cuddly 16-year-old ‘Battersea mutt’ called PC . (named after Prince Charles, whose distant demeanour he is said to . share) and Bounce, a labrador with impeccable manners. In the conservatory I confess to being . relieved at the reception. ‘Hmm, wait until you meet the other two,’ says Roger, 67, with a twinkle in his eye, before making a quick call on . his mobile. Within minutes his son, James, 24, . appears clutching leads on which are tethered Jason, a German shepherd . whose darting eyes give the distinct impression he is not to be messed . with, and Humphrey, a Staffordshire mastiff cross who makes an immediate . lunge at parts of my body I’d prefer to keep. ‘I got them both from the courts where they were about to be put down,’ says Mugford, patting and calming both dogs. ‘In the case of Humphrey, a very . funny Crown Court judge announced, “Humphrey Mugford, I sentence you to . live with Roger Mugford for the rest of your life.” He is no problem, . living here. Sadly, Staffies are one of the nicest breeds of dogs owned . by some of the nastiest people.’ Worth taking the plunge: After restoring the four-bedroom mansion, Roger has put it on the market for £1.25million . Roger finds a story behind most . things, including his house – one half of a 19th Century mansion. ‘I . found details of its history with the deeds,’ he says. It was built in 1870 for Mary Augusta . Holland, of Holland Park in London fame, by her husband, Charles Fox, . whose father was a notable Whig politician, because she was scandalising . polite London society. So she was sent here to the country and it . seems she scandalised Surrey too, although we aren’t sure how.’ Roger bought the house three years ago . for £765,000 as a renovation project because he ‘felt sorry for it’. Lady of the manor: The mansion was built for Mary Augusta Holland in 1870 . The heating didn’t work; the roof needed mending; the wiring was . dangerous; the colour scheme was out of Footballers’ Wives; and as it . had been empty for some time, thieves had stolen stone from the terrace. At a cost of £200,000, the house is . now beautifully restored. Roger proudly shows off the large, modern . kitchen leading to the elegant hall with black-and-white tiled floor, . then two beautifully proportioned living rooms. Upstairs, a grand landing has arches . leading to four bedrooms. The colour scheme – muted pastels and light . green shades – is soothing and the views, over farmland to the Surrey . Hills, are to die for. Curiously, Roger spends most of his . time in his large, untidy conservatory. Here, over tea, he regales me . with tales of his royal clients. ‘ . The Queen is very knowledgeable and . very authoritative, which is good because democracy doesn’t work with . animals,’ he says of the time he was summoned to correct the Royal . corgis after they attacked Princess Beatrice’s terrier. He was even more impressed by Princess . Anne, for whom he appeared in court when she was convicted under the . Dangerous Dog Act in 2002 after her bull terrier, Dotty, attacked two . children. ‘Before we went into court, she whispered, “If I go down, just . remember one thing – St Helena  is a long way away” – referring to the . days when people would be banished there.’ The gardens, which Roger has also . rescued, are a mixture of formality, in the rebuilt terrace and elegant . swimming pool, and the unruly, in an area of wild garden. The house, admittedly, suffers road . noise from the M25, but it is an easy commute to London and it isn’t on . the flight paths. It would suit a family, perhaps with a horse-loving . child, as Roger owns adjoining land and would sell or rent a field to a . future owner. As for Roger, he already owns a bungalow nearby and intends replacing it with an  eco-house that he will design himself. Dr Roger Mugford’s house in St Ann’s .

Nicole Haynes, 35, underwent keyhole surgery to her abdomen earlier this year. When she passed away unexpectedly several weeks later, staff at the hospital discovered a pair of surgical clips had not been removed following the routine procedure. Tragic: Nicole Haynes died after clips were left in her abdomen . The doctor, who has not been named, is no longer carrying out operations but has not been suspended. Eastbourne District General Hospital in East Sussex has apologised to Mrs Haynes's family and launched an investigation. Her husband Nigel was yesterday too upset to comment. But the 46-year-old plasterer posted an online tribute to his wife on behalf of himself and their young son, Alfie. He wrote: 'To the most beautiful wife and mother. We will miss and love you for ever. All our love. Nigel and Alfie. xxxx.' Mr Haynes's parents, Pam and Len, also left a message, which read: 'Daughter-in-law with the sunniest smile, we miss you so much.' Another tribute read: 'Our beautiful sister-in-law. We promised to look . after Nigel and Alfie and we always will. You're in our hearts for ever, . love you always.' Just four days before she died on March 29, Mrs Haynes had updated her Facebook page with a piece of art done by her son. Eastbourne District General Hospital: Where Mrs Haynes had the operation . Her operation, known as a laparoscopy, is extremely common and generally regarded as very safe. It involves a surgeon making a minor incision and then using a small flexible tube containing a light source and a camera to access the inside of the abdomen and the pelvis. Surgical clips are routinely used in such operations. As it is much less invasive than conventional surgery, patients benefit from an easier and speedier recovery, as well as reduced blood loss and smaller scars. An estimated 250,000 women have laparoscopic surgery on the NHS each year to treat gynaecological conditions. Serious complications occur in only one in 1,000 cases. The cause of Mrs Haynes's death is not known, but the hospital confirmed the tragedy. A Trust spokesman said: 'An investigation is currently under way following the death of a patient after laparoscopic surgery. We have been in contact with the patient's family and offered our sincere condolences. 'We are treating this with the utmost seriousness and the surgeon involved is not currently undertaking any operations pending the outcome of the investigation.' An inquest into the death has been opened and adjourned by East Sussex Coroner's Court. Two years ago it emerged that a hospital blunder left a woman with a swab the size of a tea towel in her body for four months after a hysterectomy. Susan Misiewicz was in acute pain after the procedure and was put on a series of antibiotics by doctors. It was only when she was finally given a CT scan that the oversight was spotted – an 18in by 18in piece of thick cotton swab, wrapped around her bowel. Part of her bowel had to be removed in an operation to remove the swab.","Investigation launched after death of Nicole Haynes .

The toddler's immune system was so badly damaged after cancer treatment that she could not mix with other children and spent hours alone with only her pet for company. But after a course of successful treatment, the one year old is finally looking forward to playing with friends in her new garden, which has been transformed by a charity makeover. Toddler Phillippa Goymer, from Gateshead, had been forced to play in isolation away from other children after her immune system was damaged while undergoing chemotherapy for cancer . Doctors said she could not mix with other children and the little girls spent hours alone with only her dog Ben for company . Doctors discovered that the little girl was suffering from a rare cancer just weeks after she was born and the one year old had to undergo gruelling chemotherapy sessions. The treatment damaged her immune system which meant she had to be kept apart from other children to stop her catching their germs. She played alone in the family's back garden at Lobley Hill, Tyne & Wear, with just her dog Ben for company. After months, her chemotherapy sessions have ended, and the one-year-old has had immunisation jabs to protect her. Now a charity-funded makeover has transformed the drab area into a safe and colourful place where she can play with her new friends. Mother, Cassie, 32, said: 'After her treatment, Pip was so vulnerable to infection we could barely take her outside, it was a nightmare. 'She couldn't spend time with other children and her life was very limited. Her best friend was her dog, Ben. But she has now received her immunisation jabs and can finally play with other children in her new garden, which recently received a charity-funded makeover from its drab original condition . Doctors discovered that the little girl was suffering from a rare cancer just weeks after she was born and the one year old had to undergo gruelling chemotherapy sessions . 'Now we have a beautiful garden and she is so much better - seeing her play there with other children is lovely to watch. It's a blessing as we're having a lovely summer, she's out there constantly. Pip is blooming - and so is the garden. Last month, Lloyds TSB and CLIC, a children's cancer charity, paid to turn the area, which was filled with rocks and bare soil, into a lovely, lawned haven with outdoor toys for the toddler. A swing will also soon arrive for Philippa, courtesy of the Toma fund, a charity which helps youngsters with childhood cancer. Mrs Goymer and her husband Philip, 32, a technical adviser, were distraught when they learnt their new-born baby had Rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare type of cancer found in the vulva and needed lengthy chemotherapy treatment. Mother, Cassie, 32, said her daughter was so vulnerable to infection after treatment they could barely take her outside . The garden was once home to rocks and shrubbery and was difficult for the little girl to play in . She said: 'She lost her hair and was very sick, all the usual things you would expect. You don't expect children to recover when they are diagnosed with rare forms of cancer but she seems to have beaten it and I am beyond relieved, you can't find the words to describe how it feels. 'Although it will be some time before she is given the all clear, we have been told the cancer cells are dormant. 'it was heartbreaking when we first started taking her to playgroup sessions, as she was so used to playing on her own she carried on doing just that and wouldn't interact with other kids. 'Having a safe place for her to play means so much to us, it's a lovely garden and now she doesn't have to enjoy it alone, she is playing happily with her friends.' Mrs Goymer, who also has a six-week-old son Finley, added: 'We plan to celebrate Pip's second birthday party in the garden if the sun shines.'","Phillippa Goymer diagnosed with a rare type of cancer shortly after birth .

He never goes outside. The council told me you can . train parrots to keep quiet, but I said you’re having a laugh aren’t . you?’ He was notified by the . council on Wednesday that it had fitted equipment in his neighbour’s . house to record Buddy’s calls.

A 20-year-old gunman who stormed a suburban Atlanta elementary school armed with an AK-47 today may have slipped past the school's locked doors by following a staff member, it was revealed this evening. Police say Michael Brandon Hill took a secretary in the front office hostage and demanded she call an Atlanta TV station, saying that he wanted camera crews to 'start filming at police die.' Officers arriving at Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learning Academy in Decatur, Georgia, on Tuesday afternoon exchanged gunfire with Hill. Police say the suspect fired off a half dozen rounds at officers. The gunman later surrendered. No one was injured in the frightening incident and the school's 870 students were evacuated to a nearby Wal-Mart, where they were reunited with their frantic parents.

They detonated a controlled blast in the . trunk of the car and evacuated the neighborhood around his nearby house . before making entry to search for more weapons and bombs. The shooting resulted in no injuries, but nonetheless recalled the terrifying massacre last December at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in which a lone gunman with an assault rifle killed 20 students and six teachers before taking his own life. WSB-TV reports that the school has a buzzer system that limits access to outsiders, but that that Hill may have slipped in behind a staff member who was walking into the building. GBI Director Vernon Keenan said the incident was terrifying for parents and students alike, but that the incident could havee ended much, much worse. 'It takes a lot of resources to handle something like this,' Mr Keenan told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 'We were dern lucky we didn’t have anyone killed in the school.' The students had to be evacuated through the back of the elementary school because police were concerned that the gunman's car could be rigged to explode and kill students if they fled through the front exit. Firefighters cut a hole in fencing at the back of the school property that students had to run through to escape the school. From there, they were taken by bus to a Wal-Mart parking lot about two miles away. According to ABC News, . a woman named Antoinette who works in the school office said that the . lone male gunman wanted TV crews at the scene so that he could be filmed . shooting police. She said that the gunman told her to specifically call WSB-TV. Police evacuated the neighborhood around the gunman's house as they searched his home for explosives and other weapons .

Seven years after conjoined twin girls from Utah were separated in an operation that had never been performed before, they are happy and healthier than ever. Kendra and Maliyah Herrin are now 11-years-old and are living active lives with their younger twin brothers, big sister and parents in Salt Lake City, they told the Oprah Winfrey Network. They were four when their parents, Erin and Jake, made the agonizing decision to separate them after they were born fused at the mid-torso and sharing two legs. The 26-hour surgery in August 2006 was the first time the operation had ever been performed on twins sharing a kidney, but it was successful - and little Maliyah was given a kidney transplant from her mother months later. Scroll down for video . New life: Kendra and Maliyah Herrin giggle as they appear on Oprah Winfrey's Network to show off their progress since they were separated seven years ago. The girls were born joined at the chest . Strong: The girls were born sharing two legs and now have one leg each, but are working with prosthetics . The girls, who had shared an abdomen, pelvis, liver, kidney, large intestine and two legs, were left with one leg each. After six weeks at the hospital, they returned home and had their bandages changed three times a week, a job which took two hours for each child. Maliyah also needed extra nutrition through a feeding tube, and underwent dialysis three times a week to prepare for her new kidney, which she received in April 2007. Now 11, they are 'healthier than ever, but prone to infections because of the titanium rods in their backs', their mother Erin said as they appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Network. Early years: The girls, who are now 11, shared an abdomen, pelvis, liver, kidney, large intestine and two legs . Happy: The twins, pictured before their separation, underwent a 26-hour operation in August 2006 . Whole family: Jake and Erin Herrin pose with their eldest daughter Courtney, twins Kendra and Maliyah, and second set of twins Austin and Justin at their home in Utah before the separation . Roughly one out of every 200,000 live births worldwide results in conjoined twins, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center. Around 40 to 60 per cent of conjoined twins arrive stillborn, and about 35 per cent survive only one day. The overall survival rate of conjoined twins is between 5 per cent and 25 per cent, the Center reported. The condition is three times more likely to occur among females than . males and a third of conjoined twins are attached at the lower chest, sharing organs. Chances of successful surgery and survival are greater if the twins have separate sets of organs, experts say. Although success rates have improved over the years, surgical separation is still rare. Since 1950, at least one twin has survived separation about 75 percent of the time. After separation, most twins need intensive rehabilitation because of the malformation and position of their spines. Source . Kendra and Maliyah have surgeries to straighten their spines every six months and undergo daily physical therapy. They are also learning how to use crutches and prosthetic limbs. And they do not let anything stop them; in a clip that aired on Oprah's 'Where They Are Now?' segment on Sunday, the girls giggled as they talked about their busy lives. On their Facebook page, the Herrin Twins, they are pictured enjoying days out at swimming pools, jumping on trampolines and visiting amusement parks with their friends and siblings. 'I like swimming, playing with friends, riding bikes, jumping on the tramp[oline],' Kendra says in the clip on the Oprah Winfrey show. 'Eating,' Maliyah adds. 'Yeah, eating!' Kendra says. The girls even stayed upbeat as they talked about how their surgeries 'stink' and how they miss seeing their dog when they go to the hospital. Their mother keeps friends, family and strangers updated on the girls' progress on their family blog. Loved: The family were worried about the separation because the twins shared the same kidney . Success! They are seen leaving the Primary Children's Medical Center for home in September 2007 . Beautiful: They are pictured after the operation. 'Their wills are so strong,' her mother said afterwards . 'Kendra and Maliyah are so HAPPY!! They . have so many people that love them so much. Their smiles light up a . room,' Erin wrote in one entry. 'They have taught me so much about being who I need to. And taking one day at a time. 'It took them years to recover from their separation surgery, and it takes them sometimes weeks to recover from other surgeries and sicknesses. They take everything in stride and they move forward.' The girls have had this drive since the very beginning. Five months after they were separated, they met Oprah for the first time and their mother spoke of their determination. Active: The Herrin twins said they love swimming, cycling and bouncing on their trampoline . All smiles: The girls said they hate undergoing operations to straighten their spines but remain positive . Fighters: The 11-year-old girls are now learning how to walk with prosthetic legs and the use of crutches . Standing tall: They undergo physical therapy every day and surgeries every six months to straighten their spines . 'Their wills are so strong,' Erin said at the time. 'Kendra is just up and down off of her bed. It's just amazing to us how well that they're doing.'

The 20-year-old man who police say went to an Atlanta-area school heavily armed and exchanged gunfire with officers before surrendering was a normal kid growing up, but began to change as a teenager and engage in behavior that was threatening to others, his brother said. Tim Hill, 22, told CNN's Piers Morgan on Thursday that when he and Michael Brandon Hill were growing up, he was 'like any other kid,' playing outside and in the woods. But he said that as Michael Hill got older, his violent and erratic behavior began to escalate, and that as a teen he had once tried to burn down the family home with eight people asleep inside, threatened to stab his mother and threatened to kill his brother. Troubled teen: Michael Hill was a normal kid until he hit his teeens, says his brother Tim Hill . Tim Hill said, 'Once he started . hitting his teenage years, something happened with him. Everything just . started changing after doctors started messing with his medicines here . and there, and changing them up and putting him on a different one and . institutionalizing him multiple times to correct his medicine. It just . escalated from there.' He said Michael Hill set fire to the family's home when eight people . were inside sleeping - the fire was discovered before it spread - and at . another point their mother awoke to find him standing over her with a . butcher's knife. 'My stepfather and mother ended up having to . lock up... like all the knives in the trunk of the car, just to protect . everybody in the home,' Tim Hill told Morgan. Tim Hill also . confirmed that his brother threatened his life on Facebook, prompting . him to call police. He said he feared for his life. The older . brother's comments came two days after a school bookkeeper helped . persuade Michael Hill to surrender to police following a frightening . standoff and shooting Tuesday at Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learning . Academy in Decatur, a suburb east of Atlanta. His brother's keeper: Tim Hill says he's disappointed that mental health authorities and police didn't do more to help his mentally ill brother . Police and school . officials said that school bookkeeper Antoinette Tuff helped avert a . tragedy after she was taken captive by Hill. He went to the school armed . with an AK 47-style rifle and nearly 500 rounds of ammunition, police . said. Lines of young students raced out of the building with . police and teachers escorting them to safety, recalling the chaotic . scene last December outside a Connecticut elementary school, where a . gunman killed 20 students and six educators. On a recording of a . 911 call released Wednesday, Tuff can be heard relaying messages from . Hill to DeKalb County emergency dispatcher Kendra McCray before . convincing the gunman to surrender. She tells the dispatcher that Hill . said he wasn't there to hurt the children but wanted to talk to an . unarmed officer. Calm: Antoinette Tuff says she hid her terror as she talked to the gunman . 'He said, ""Call the probation office in DeKalb County and let them know . what's going on,""' Tuff is heard telling the dispatcher. 'He said he . should have just went to the mental hospital instead of doing this, . because he's not on his medication.' No one was injured, but . police said the suspect shot into the floor and exchanged gunfire with . officers who had surrounded the school, which has 870 students in . pre-kindergarten through fifth grade. With bullets flying, Tuff urged . him to come back inside and give up. 'I knew [police] were gonna . kill him. And I knew he was not in his right state of mind,' she told . CNN's Anderson Cooper on Thursday night. On the program, she had a . tearful on-air reunion with McCray, the dispatcher who stayed on the . phone with her as she reassured Hill that surrendering peacefully was . the right thing to do. Tuff also received a call in the network's makeup . room from President Barack Obama. She said Obama wanted her to know how . proud he was of her.

'You can't get any better when you have a great leader in front of you,' a beaming Tuff is shown telling the president. Time and again, Tuff stressed that her faith got her through the episode. 'That was nobody but God's grace and mercy, because I can truly tell you I was terrified inside,' she said. She said she was praying the entire time she talked with Hill, asking God what she should say. McCray said she was frightened, too, particularly when Tuff began telling her Hill was getting agitated. 'I had to put my phone on mute [and say], ""Hey, he's getting agitated. We have got to move.""' Tuff . is 'a true hero,' McCray said on the program. 'You did so great. I've . never had a caller where the caller was so calm and so confident in what . they were saying and so personable. You made my job a whole lot . easier.' Hill is charged with aggravated assault on a police . officer, terroristic threats and possession of a firearm by a convicted . felon. Police declined to discuss what he told them when questioned. Antoinette Tuff said: 'And I just explained to him that I loved him. I didn't know much about him. I didn't know his name but I did love him and it was scary because I knew at that moment he was ready to take my life along with his' Hero: Secretary Antoinette Tuff is seen here in her office at Ronald E.

A wildfire raging out of control in Northern California and threatening the city of San Francisco power supply is so huge even astronauts are photographing it from outer space. NASA astronaut Karen Nyberg tweeted a photo Saturday evening of the Rim Fire as seen from her perch 230 miles above the earth. The Rim Fire has already scorched some 250 square miles and breached Yosemite National Park. Now NASA’s photos from the International Space Station serve to dramatically underscores the extent of the inferno that remains just 5 percent contained. Huge: A NASA astronaut on the International Space Station snapped this photo of the massive smoke plume from California's raging wildfire August 24 . Extreme terrain is hampering efforts by firefighters to stop the fire, which has now forced closures to the pristine Yosemite National Park after blacking out 12,000 acres of park land by early Saturday. From above, the dire situation only appears more grave. Between billowing clouds an astronaut like Nyberg is accustomed to gazing upon from orbit, Earth is also now sporting a black scar on North America’s West Coast and ominous sooty smoke trailing eastward with prevailing winds. It is nearly impossible to gauge the size of the plume from Nyberg’s astonishing photos when both the curve of the earth and endless smoke are visible in the same frame. Devastation: Another snapshot from space shows a wildfire that has already consumed more than 200 square miles, now raging out of control in California's Yosemite National Park . Looking down: Astronaut Karen Nyberg posted the startling fire photo to her Twitter account late August 24. She took the shot from 230 miles above the earth . In another striking NASA photo of the destructive fire, the thick smoke can be clearly seen above much of Yosemite, and the flames themselves are outlined in the satellite shot, all but dwarfing the 55,000 acre Mono Lake nearby. The blaze tripled in size to 128,000 acres between Thursday and Friday, more than three times the size of San Francisco. Governor Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency for the city, which lies 150 miles away, because of the threat to the city's utilities, with two of three hydroelectric power stations shut down. City water supplies were also threatened. Scorched: Burned land surrounds a welcome sign near Yosemite National Park August 24.

Battle: Firefighters continued battling at the front lines of the Rim Fire August 24, which has raged since August 17 . Mystery: The cause of the so-called Rim Fire remained under investigation Saturday . The Hetch Hetchy Reservoir provides water to 2.6 million customers in the San Francisco area and Brown in his declaration said the city's water supply could be affected if the blaze harms the reservoir. The reservoir provides about 85 percent of San Francisco's water needs and has not been disrupted by the fire, said Tyrone Jue, spokesman for the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. San Francisco could draw on water from neighbors if the supply is compromised, he said. There have been no reports of blackouts in San Francisco, which is drawing on a reserve of power stored for emergencies. It also has spent around $700,000 buying power on the open market after two powerhouses in the path of the fire were shut down.

A new investigation has lifted the lid on the global fashion industry dynamics that make designer swimsuits so expensive. Every summer women in changing rooms around the country wonder why they feel compelled to pay hundreds of dollars for a suit that covers just a few inches of skin. But designer Melissa Odabash explains to MailOnline that engineering a swimsuit is every bit as challenging as a shirt or dress. Quality over quantity: High-end designers claim that their more expensive pieces such as the $203 Shimmi bikini modeled by Miranda Kerr, are justified because they use better material and tailoring . 'It can take up to five machines to make . one swimsuit and the fabric costs the same amount as clothing fabric,' she says. Swimsuits are like lingerie  - except that, unlike underwear, designers also have to make sure that it holds up . while running into waves and jumping off diving boards. Creating a garment that looks great and stands up to salt, sand and chlorine presents additional design challenges. 'We’re working on a small canvas, so it’s more challenging to . create a suit that feels good and … is innovative and fashion-forward,' swimwear designer Karla Colletto tells Slate. Anecdotal evidence suggests that cheap . swimsuits fall apart after one season, while higher-priced ones are . built to last. But is this true? Celebrity fans: Kate Moss (left, pictured in . August 2013) is a fan of Melissa Odabash while Kelly Brook (right, . pictured in 2010) is often spotted in Vix bikinis . 'The fabric in high end swimwear lasts,' Ms Odabash says. 'A lot of cheap swimwear . companies either don't line [swimsuits], or do a straight stitch, which . is faster to sew.' She adds: 'We do self lining which means the outside fabric is the same as the inside lining, and use very expensive hardware that goes through testing to make sure it does not change.' 'A lot of cheap swimwear . companies either don't line swimsuits, or do a straight stitch, which . is faster to sew' Then there is the spandex factor. The stretchy staple fabric remains more expensive than, for example, the sturdy . nylon or cotton used in men’s swimwear. And smaller designers can't negotiate the same bulk manufacturer discounts as discount megastores like Target and H&M. But when shopping strictly based on fabric it can tough to spot the difference between the low and high end bikinis - especially when shopping online. Dolce & Gabbana's black bikini, priced at $330 has a triangle top made of 85per cent polyamide, and 15per cent elastane - which are fancy European words for 'nylon' and 'spandex'. The briefs have a ratio of 82 to 18per cent. Ready for her close-up: Supermodel Alessandra Ambrosio was pictured earlier this month wearing a Missoni bikini that retails for around $360 . Bargain bikini: Beyonce models a black bikini from H&M, where the majority of swimsuit separates are priced at under $20 . Contrast this with Target's Mossimo triangle . bikini, priced at $9.98 for the top and $13.98 for the bottom - also . also constructed from 82per cent nylon and 18per cent spandex. According to the NPD Group, the global . swimwear industry is now worth $13.25 billion annually, and the average . American woman owns four swimsuits. But smaller labels may only have a short window of time to get the garments manufactured and shipped back to the States to make a sale, which also adds to production costs. 'I think being in a swimsuit . is daunting enough - women want to feel confident that everything will . be held in place, lifted and not loose' Marshal Cohen, chief fashion analyst at the NPD Group, told the New York Times that selling bikini tops and bottoms separately, rather than as a matched set, is more expensive for designers. 'A fifty dollar suit has become a seventy dollar suit,' he said. As with couture clothes, shoppers are a high-end designer's expertise - and because they believe that feeling beautiful on the beach is worth the investment. 'I think being in a swimsuit or a bikini . is daunting enough and women want to feel confident that everything will . be held in place, lifted and not loose,' Ms Odabash says. 'It's well . worth spending on good quality, [and] it will be actually cheaper in the long . run.'","The global .

The City of Fort Worth has halted all demolitions after the wrongful destruction of two houses came to light recently. City contractors tore down a dwelling not scheduled for demolition at Lagonda Drive, then the very next day tore down the wrong house on the wrong property on Watercress Drive. The city has released a statement admitting the error, and has halted all demolitions until the cause of the two errors can be found and officials can ensure the mistake does not occur for a third time. Vacant lot: The two dwellings that belonged to a family at Lagonda Drive have now disappeared, leaving behind only empty land . 'It was human error,' Fort Worth spokesperson Bill Begley told reporters. 'There were two different types of human error.' The first wrongful demolition was only discovered after the owners of the second property at Watercress Drive alerted authorities. On July 11, a structure that was damaged by fire was razed by Garrett Demolition, a contractor for the City of Fort Worth. The house was scheduled for demolition - but an undamaged smaller dwelling behind it not part of the demolition order was also torn down. Razed: This small house containing years of family history and possessions was mistakenly torn down by Fort Worth city contractors . Scheduled: This main home was damaged in a fire and the city had permission to demolish it . Overzealous: Anchonda, one of the the Lagonda Drive property owners, was devastated to find city contractors had pulled down a building not on the demolition order . According to NBC 5, the work order only detailed the destruction of the first home with pictures and a site map of the one home. The second building contained family photographs, keepsakes and other property belonging to the owners of the buildings. Property owner Juanita Anchonda said her family hadn't complained to the city about the mistake earlier because they didn't believe there was anything they could do. 'I didn't call anyone. It's just that I thought there's nothing you can do,' Anchonda told the Star-Telegram. 'It seemed like if they did it, they must've had authority to do it. So what can you do, if they did it, what can you do?' Puzzled: David Underwood and his wife were perplexed when they drove to their property at Lake Worth but couldn't find their house . Anchonda said many family possessions were lost when the house got knocked down on July 11. 'My mom's stuff, her clothes, her shoes, her boots. Everything. Her pictures, my grandma's pictures,' Anchonda said. This destruction wasn't noted by the city until the owner of a second property that was knocked down on July 12 alerted authorities to the error. David Underwood was the owner of a large, three-bedroom, ranch-style home in Silver Creek. The house once belonged to his grandmother and Underwood and his wife intended to renovate the property and eventually move in. Foundations: A concrete slab is all that remains of the three-bedroom home overlooking Lake Worth that belonged to the Underwood family . Dilapidated: The rundown house next door to the Underwood's home that had been scheduled for demolition since January . The Underwoods took a drive out to visit their property recently - but they couldn't find it. 'We came around Silver Creek looking for the lot and my wife said, ""David, I think the house is gone,""' Underwood told Fox FW. 'We looked up there and sure enough, it's gone!' Their house overlooking a lake at 9708 Watercress Drive had disappeared, with only a smooth concrete slab remaining to indicate where the property once stood. The house that was actually supposed to be torn down was next door at 9716 Watercress Drive, and had been scheduled for demolition since January and bore all the signs of dilapidation, with broken windows and untended lawn. 'I just seen an excavator tearing that house down and I was wondering . why,' neighbor Stephen Neumann told CBS. Empty: The City of Fort Worth has said it will compensate the two property owners for the mistake that cost them their homes and possessions . Marked: The letterbox is all the remains of the home which was wrongfully demolished at 9708 Watercress Drive . 'It was a pretty good house, it wasn’t all that . bad, when this one next door has been needing tearing down for years.' 'There is a common thread,' Begley said. 'It was the same contractor with the same code supervisor in charge and the same code supervisor on site.  That said, in both instances there were honest mistakes made. And that’s why we’re putting policies in place to ensure we have safeguards. At Lagonda the contractor took it a step too far, at Watercress we had a city staffer inappropriately mark the house. So in both instances there was a human error.' According to CBS, the code compliance employee is on paid administrative leave during an investigation into the incidents.  The contractor did not respond to a request for a statement.Begley said the city is working to 'do what is right' for the property owners. Underwood, who works to build community centers in disadvantaged neighborhoods, has graciously accepted the turn of events. 'I see so much around here, people that need help and have less that, it’s an accident, let’s do what’s right and move on,' he told Fox 4.","A city contractor pulled down two wrong houses in two days .

A renowned diver who is known as a skilled 'shark whisperer' has been filmed putting her hand inside a shark's mouth to remove a fishing hook lodged in its gullet. As sharks swarm all around her and fellow divers in clear blue waters off the Bahamas, Italian-born Cristina Zenato fearlessly reaches into the predator's mouth and pulls the hook out. The fierce fish seems totally at ease with her, and even as she reaches deep into its throat it doesn't attempt to bite. Nevertheless, in addition to her wetsuit she is dressed in chainlink body armour. Brave: Fearless diver Cristina Zenato reaches elbox deep inside the mouth of a reef shark to remove a hook lodged in the creature's gullet as she and colleagues swim in clear blue waters off the Bahamas . Shark whisperer: The shark wriggles in discomfort as Ms Zenato removes the hook, but does not try to bite her . Mission accomplished: The hook finally removed, she allows the shark to swim away . Ms Zenato was able to put the shark into a trance-like state using a little-known technique of rubbing the ampullae of Lorenzini - the name given to hundreds of jelly-filled pores around the creature's nose and mouth. This causes induces 'tonic immobility', where the shark enters a natural state of paralysis for up to 15 minutes and appears to be asleep in her hands. The pores act as electroreceptors detecting prey moving in the electromagnetic field around the shark - but also for some reason rubbing them turns 'Jaws' into a sleeping baby. Ms Zenato uses her ability to put the . sharks in a sleepy state to educate other divers, remove parasites and . even - as in this case - take out fishing hooks caught in their mouths. 'In my daily work and dives with sharks I am always removing their hooks,' Ms Zenato was quoted as saying. 'In this particular case it was harder than usual. After putting the shark in tonic I had to pull it from deep inside.' Don't try this at home: Ms Zenato was able to put the shark into a trance-like state by rubbing pores around its face and head, a trick which cause 'tonic immobility' - a state of paralysis that lasts up to 15 minutes . Ms Zenato has been working with sharks for nearly 20 years, but still wears a chain link suit in case one of the animals is tempted to bite. Her remarkable talents have made her much sought-after by filmmakers, documentary and TV producers worldwide and she has worked with organisations including BBC, Discovery, Nat Geo, ABC, Science and Nature. She is the dive team manager at the Underwater Explorers Society (UNEXSO) on Grand Bahama Island.","Diver Cristina Zenato is world renowned for her work with sharks .

Crash: Mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner was involved in a minor car crash Saturday morning on FDR Drive in Manhattan. He's pictured above getting out of a car last week . It wasn't immediately clear where Weiner was headed or if he was on official business. A Fire Department of New York spokeswoman says no one was hurt in the crash. She says it happened near East 96th Street. Weiner is seeking the Democratic nomination for mayor. The primary is September 10 and he is currently fourth place in the polls in light of a recent sexting scandal. Weiner stepped down from his position as a U.S. Representative for New York in 2011 after he accidentally tweeted a naked picture of himself which led to several women coming forward claiming the married man sent them similar pictures online. Falling behind: Since entering the mayoral race, Weiner has gone from being a front runner to fourth place due to a second sexting scandal . His wife Huma Abedin, a former aid for Hillary Clinton, stayed with him after he stepped down from office. His political career was on the road to being salvaged when he announced earlier this year that he would be running for mayor and was an early favorite to win the race. But it seems that Weiner didn't give up his digital indiscretions. More women came forward with evidence that Weiner continued to send lewd pictures to them even after he stepped down from office, including aspiring political blogger Sydney Leathers, 23. Since then, public support for Weiner has dramatically decreased as fellow politicians, including disgraced former governor Eliot Spitzer, call for him to drop out of the race.",The mayoral candidate plagued by two sexting scandals was involved in a minor car accident while being driven on FDR Drive in Manhattan .

It . said hypotheses ran from a simple case of forced sex involving Kercher . 'to a group erotic game that blew up and got out of control'.

Earlier this year, Knox said the future was very unsure for her financially and that she is almost broke because of her huge legal bills - despite a $1.5million book advance. She will be paid a reported $4million in total for her memoir Waiting To Be Heard but claimed that her retrial and a potential libel lawsuits will leave her penniless.

A former star of the New York Knicks’ last championship team was found dead of a possible drug overdose Friday in New York. Dean ‘The Dream’ Meminger was found dead just before 12pm Friday of an apparent drug overdose by staff at the Casablanca Hotel in Harlem. He was fully clothed and still wearing his championship ring from the Knicks last title in 1973. Rooms at the seedy hotel cost less than $100 a night. The former Knicks and Atlanta Hawks player had struggled with well-publicized addictions to cocaine and crack for most of his adult life. Hard to the hoop: Dean Meminger (7) played hard and partied hard . Meminger was found with ‘white stuff oozing out of his nose… like had had a seizure after he was using cocaine,’ the New York Post reported. Despite making as much as $100,000 a season during his playing years, Meminger died in a $95-a-night single room occupancy hotel, according to a hotel employee reached by MailOnline, in a rough area of Harlem. Meminger was a key player for a 1973 Knicks team with stars like Willis Reed, Walt Frazier, Earl ‘The Pearl’ Monroe and Bill Bradley. Playing both guard positions, ‘the Dream’ was a lock down defender that partied as hard as he played. He was routinely getting high even during his playing days, which perhaps contributed to his career ending at only age 28. ‘There was also a back room at most [after game] parties, a place to get high. Meminger was among those who walked into those back rooms,’ Meminger told the New York Times in 2003. Despite several stints in rehab, followed by several relapses, Meminger appears to have never fully escaped the firm grip drugs had on his life . A drug addled Meminger almost died in 2009 from a fire allegedly started by a crack pipe at the Bronx boarding house where he was staying, according to the New York Daily News. Before the drugs took hold: Dean Meminger (14) laying for Marquette against Fordham at Madison Square Garden in 1971 . Meminger suffered such severe smoke inhalation in the fire that he had to be revived on the sidewalk by paramedics, reported the Daily News, which added that several used crack pipes were littered around his body. Having first starred as a high school player in New York, Meminger played college ball at Marquette University before spending four years with the Knicks, two with the Hawks and 32 games back with the Knicks in 1977 before they ended his career by releasing him. Meminger bounced around several low-level coaching jobs before finding himself out of basketball for good after the 2003 season. He is survived by son Dean Meminger, an anchor with cable news station NY1 and a daughter, according to reports. The cause of death has not yet been determined and is pending an autopsy, a New York Police Department spokesperson told MailOnline. The Knicks organization could not be reached for comment.","Dean 'The Dream' Meminger played a key role in the Knicks last championship team in 1973 .

Taxpayer-funded foreign aid supplies worth nearly half a million pounds ended up in the hands of Al Qaeda terrorists. The supplies were seized from a warehouse by militant Islamist group al-Shabaab as it rampaged through southern Somalia. Details of the thefts were buried in the Department for International Development’s latest annual accounts. The growing chorus of fury . The thefts took place in repeated incidents over a four-month period between November 2011 and February 2012 – raising questions as to why no action was taken. The revelations will increase pressure on ministers over Britain’s spiralling aid budget. Last week UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom criticised increases in aid spending, saying it was going to dictators to buy ‘Ray-Ban sunglasses, apartments in Paris and Ferraris’. He was criticised for using the phrase ‘Bongo Bongo land’ to describe recipients of aid. But commentators also backed his wider point about sharp increases in aid spending as the rest of government is enduring sharp cuts. He said: ‘How we can possibly be giving a billion pounds a month, when we’re in this sort of debt, to Bongo Bongo land is completely beyond me.’ The Mail revealed last week that, during the length of this parliament, more than a billion pounds of aid was going to oil-rich Nigeria, which has its own space programme and wants to put a man in space. Four other countries in Africa with space programmes are also in receipt of lavish aid spending. Outspoken: His exact wording may have been out of order, but the point Godfrey Bloom was trying to get across on foreign aid may hit home now . Al-Shabaab is a cell of Al-Qaeda which, last year, threatened to carry out an attack on Britain that would ‘eclipse the horrors of 7/7 and 21/7 combined’. Several British nationals are known to have trained with the group. DfID stated that there was no prior warning of the attacks and its partner organisations in Somalia were unable to move the supplies. The accounts said the £480,000 was written off ‘following the theft between November 2011 and February 2012, by al-Shabaab in southern Somalia, of DfID-funded humanitarian materials and supplies from the offices and warehouses of partner organisations, to which DfID had provided funding to deliver projects and programmes’. ‘DfID’s partners had no prior warning of the confiscations being carried out and therefore had no time to prevent the loss by relocating goods. ‘While the theft suffered represented a stores loss, the property was not stolen from DfID stores. DfID funding was provided to purchase goods but no benefit was received by the end recipient due to the theft.’ Last night a spokesman claimed the supplies had been destroyed by the group. It said among the items stolen was ‘petty cash’. A spokesman said: ‘DfID works in some of the most dangerous places in the world, including Somalia, because tackling the root causes of poverty and instability there ensures a safer world and a safer UK. 'Working in conflict-affected and fragile states carries inherent risk. DfID does all it can to mitigate against this but, on occasion, losses will occur. ‘We work with our partners to design programmes that protect our investment from misuse or theft.’ Aid spending is set to reach nearly £11billion by 2015, to meet a pledge by Mr Cameron that taxpayers should give away 0.7 per cent of GDP every year. A spokesman for the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘This is yet more evidence of how hard it is to turn good intentions into genuine help for those in countries with deeply dysfunctional politics where security cannot be taken for granted. ‘Many taxpayers will see this as more evidence that foreign aid should not be increasing dramatically when there is so much pressure on other budgets.’","The supplies were seized by militant Islamist group al-Shabaab .

Rachelle Gendron is also alleged to have sent the teen photos of herself naked and topless during their affair. Prosecutors said the 27 year old sent dozens of text messages during the course of the affair which began last October. Charged: Former sex-ed teacher Rachelle Gendron, 27, was arraigned in court Friday on charges that she raped a 14-year-old student . Gendron looked visibly shaken and close to tears as she was arraigned on five rape charges aggravated by the age difference. She later openly wept in the courtroom watched by her mother as she was granted bail. Gendron was also charged with enticement of a child under the age of 16. Prosecutors told Worcester Superior Court they have strong evidence to support the charges. 'We have in our possession a number of text messages, as well of photos of Ms. Gendron in various states of undress with genitals and breasts exposed from the victim's cellphone, that support the allegations against her,' said Assistant District Attorney Cheryl Riddle. Gendron worked as a health and sex education teacher at North Central Charter Essential School in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. She was fired from her job after being arrested on the sex crime charges. Unemployed: Gendron has since been fired from her job as a teacher at the North Central Charter School in Fitchburg, Massachusetts . According to the indictments Gendron had sex with the boy three times in October of 2012, once in January and again in March of 2013. Sometime from April to March she enticed the boy, one indictment alleged. Gendron’s attorney Andrea Levy issued a statement denying the charges. 'My client Rachelle Gendron pleaded not guilty to the indictments. An indictment is merely an allegation and it’s the Commonwealth’s obligation to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt as to each and every element as to the offenses to which she is charged,' the statement said. 'She maintains her innocence and that’s why she entered the pleas of not guilty.' Gendron began teaching at the school in 2008. A graduate of Wheaton College in Norton, Massachusetts, Gendron earned her B.A. in English and studio art (Summa Cum Laude). Gendron is a sister of Phi Beta Kappa and 'enjoys sleeping late, singing opera, healthy excess and anything ""impractical,""' according to an online profile. Shame: Gendron's mother attended her daughter's hearing Friday, left. Gendron was visibly shaken as she listened to prosecutors speak of the sexual photographs found on the 14-year-old's phone . Still living with her parents: The 27-year-old Gendron has been living with her parents at their Fitchburg home ever since she graduated from college in 2004 . Police had begun investigating Gendron back in May, according to Fitchburg police Sgt Glenn Fossa. After Gendron’s arraignment on Friday, the North Charter school issued a statement expressing their 'shock and concern'. 'The North Central Charter Essential School’s highest priority is the safety and well-being of our students and we are both shocked and concerned by the allegations against the former employee in question,' the statement read. 'Upon first learning of those allegations, we took prompt and appropriate action consistent with the best interests of our students, which included swiftly terminating the individual and fully cooperating with law enforcement authorities investigating this matter. Until this matter is resolved, however, we cannot offer further comment.' Prosecutor Riddle requested a $5,000 bail. Defense attorney Andrea Levy asked for no bail on the promise Gendron return for her next court day on October 10. Judge James R. Lemire set bail at $2,000. Gendron is not allowed to contact the victim, not allowed to teach or have contact with children under 16-years-old, and must abide by a harassment order issued in Fitchburg District Court. Aggravated rape charges carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison in Massachusetts.","Former sex-ed teacher Rachelle Gendron was arraigned in court Friday on charges that she raped a 14-year-old student .

Fitzgerald . fought the fines by arguing her ex-boyfriend registered the old car in . her name and parked it at O'Hare Airport without her knowing. All 678 . tickets were issued and placed on the car without it ever being towed . away, according to the Chicago Tribune. Revenge: Brandon Preveau, right, allegedly racked up thousands of dollars in parking fines in the name of his ex-girlfriend Jennifer Fitzgerald, left . Victim: Ms Fitzgerald was subjected to the prank after the end of her relationship with Mr Preveau . The . ruling requires Preveau to pay a down payment of $1,600 and for . Fitzgerald to pay $78 a month for the next three years until the balance . is settled, the Tribune reported. Fitzgerald maintained while suing the city for relief of the fees that Preveau . bought the Chevy from her uncle and registered it in her name before . parking it in the employee lot at O'Hare without her knowing, according . to the Tribune. Preveau works at the airport, the paper noted. In . addition to receiving abandoned car tickets, the jalopy was also . repeatedly ticketed for improperly ticketed windows, not having a city . parking sticker, expired plates and registration, cracked or missing . windows and broken tail lights, according to the Tribune. 'Parties . came together and worked out a reasonable resolution to this . situation,' city spokesperson Roderick Drew told the paper. 'By . following the terms of the settlement, at the end of this three year . period Ms. Fitzgerald will be able to resolve the debts, receive her . driver’s license — which she could not have with all of these tickets . hanging over her head — and she can move on with her life.'

Tens of thousands of people marched to the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial and down the National Mall on Saturday, commemorating the 50th anniversary of King's famous speech and pledging that his dream includes equality for gays, Latinos, the poor and the disabled. The event was an homage to a generation of activists that endured fire hoses, police abuse and indignities to demand equality for African Americans. But there was a strong theme of unfinished business. 'This is not the time for nostalgic commemoration,' said Martin Luther King III, the oldest son of the slain civil rights leader. Scroll down for video . Tens of thousands of people marched to the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial and down the National Mall on Saturday, commemorating the 50th anniversary of King's famous speech . Sybrina Fulton, Trayvon Martin's mother, spoke at the ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial where posters of her slain son were everywhere . 'Nor is this the time for self-congratulatory celebration. The task is not done. The journey is not complete. We can and we must do more.' Eric Holder, the nation's first black attorney general, said he would not be in office, nor would Barack Obama be president, without those who marched. 'They marched in spite of animosity, oppression and brutality because they believed in the greatness of what this nation could become and despaired of the founding promises not kept,' Holder said. Holder mentioned gays and Latinos, women and the disabled as those who had yet to fully realize Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream. Speakers included Rep. John Lewis, left, the only surviving speaker from the 1963 March and Martin Luther King III, the oldest son of the slain civil rights leader . A man holds a sign depicting slain youth Trayvon Martin during the March on Washington rally . Others in the crowd advocated organized labor, voting rights, revamping immigration policies and access to local post offices. Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., the only surviving speaker from the 1963 March on Washington, railed against a recent Supreme Court decision that effectively erased a key anti-discrimination provision of the Voting Rights Act. Lewis was a leader of a 1965 march, where police beat and gassed marchers who demanded access to voting booths. 'I gave a little blood on that bridge in Selma, Ala., for the right to vote,' he said. 'I am not going to stand by and let the Supreme Court take the right to vote away from us. You cannot stand by. You cannot sit down. You've got to stand up. Speak up, speak out and get in the way.' Organizers expected about 100,000 people to participate in the event, the precursor to the actual anniversary of the Aug. 28, 1963, march. Marchers began arriving early Saturday, many staking out their spots as the sun rose in a clear sky over the Capitol. By midday, tens of thousands had gathered on the National Mall.

Attorney General Eric Holder mentioned gays and Latinos, women and the disabled as those who had yet to fully realize Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream . Lynda Chambers, 58, gave up a day's pay to attend because her retail job does not provide paid vacation. Even as a seven-year-old at the time of the original march, she felt alienated and deprived of her rights. Remembering those feelings, she said, she was compelled to make the trip Saturday. 'I wanted to have some sort of connection to what I have always known, as far as being a black person,' she said. Speakers frequently mentioned persistent high unemployment among blacks, which is about twice that of white Americans, and the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida. Along the Mall, Martin's picture was nearly as ubiquitous as King's. 'I'm here supporting this march because there are so many injustices in this country,' said Alice Long, 59, who traveled from Huntsville, Ala. 'I'm very concerned about it because I have a 5-year-old grandson and a 13-year-old granddaughter.' 50 years ago: On August 28, 1963, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. addressed marchers during his famous 'I Have a Dream' speech at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington . Students of Howard University march from campus to the Lincoln Memorial to participate in the Realize the Dream Rally . Long, a NASA administrative assistant, brought along her grandchildren to give them a close-up view of African-American and civil rights history that she said isn't being taught in schools. Those in attendance arrived in a post-9/11 Washington that was very different from the one civil rights leaders visited in 1963. Then, people crowded the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and could get close to King to hear his speech. On Saturday, metal barriers kept people away from the reflecting pool. Only a small group of attendees was allowed near the memorial. Everyone else had been pushed back and watched and listened to the speeches on big-screen televisions. Police were stationed atop the Lincoln Memorial. There was a media area and VIP seating. On the day of the anniversary, President Barack Obama will speak from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, the same place King stood when he delivered his 'I Have a Dream' speech. Obama will be joined by former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter. Churches and groups have been asked to ring bells at 3 p.m. Wednesday, marking the exact time King spoke. Former Congressman and New York City mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner put in an appearance at the rally . On Friday, a coalition of black leaders issued what they said is the 21st century agenda for the nation as it marks the watershed civil rights event that helped bring about the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The 1963 march drew some 250,000 to the National Mall and ushered in the idea of massive, nonviolent demonstrations. The leaders named economic parity, equity in education, voting rights, health care access and criminal justice reform as national policy priorities. Organizers of Saturday's march hoped this year's event would serve to inspire people again to educate themselves about issues they see as making up the modern civil rights struggle. 'It's very difficult to stomach the fact that Trayvon wasn't committing any crime. He was on his way home from the store,' Sybrina Fulton, Trayvon's mother, said Friday as she prepared to participate in the march. 'Don't wait until it's at your front door. Don't wait until something happens to your child. ... This is the time to act now. This is the time to get involved.' Economic parity, equity in education, voting rights, health care access and criminal justice reform were all issues mentioned during the speeches .","An estimated 100,000 marched to commemorate Martin Luther King's famous speech .

He was found dead in August 1992, when he was just 24. Croom's father David said the teenager had hinted that he was attracted to the same adventure. 'He was talking to another friend that it . would be great to just leave penniless and just work along the way and . get resources like they did in the movie,' he told MyFoxPhoenix.com.

'As far as we know he left in shorts . and a T-shirt and a backpack with some socks in it and he left the car . and that's all we know.' His mother Monica added that her son . is 'super smart' and has Boy Scout experience. She added that his SUV didn't . break down, wasn't out of gas and was unlocked with money inside. Officers added that the vehicle had not been broken into. Search teams have scoured the area for clues to his whereabouts but have turned up nothing. Have you seen him?

Johnathan was traveling alone on his . way back from Seattle where he had visited a female friend but failed to . return home. He had originally left Arizona on July 30. On his blog earlier this year, he described himself as someone looking for excitement and adventure. 'I am definitely searching for my purpose in the world and writing about Life,' he wrote. 'I want to teach people to live . extraordinarily unusual, fun, exhilarating lives. In order to do so, I . need to be living the excitement myself.' But he added in a post written in May: 'I do recognize that I make very bad decisions, quite often. 'These . decisions lead to a lot of remorse and unhappiness. I know I should . just let these things go and push forward, as I’d recommend to anybody, . but it’s hard. Vanished: On his blog, Croom said he wanted to live an exciting life so he could teach others how to do so . 'I am trying though. I truly am...

Diabetes will cost the NHS more than a sixth of its entire budget by 2035, a report has warned. The disease accounts for 10 per cent (£9.8 billion) of NHS spending, but this is projected to rise to £16.9 billion over the next 25 years, or 17 per cent of the health service's funds. Yet researchers also found that up to four-fifths of the money goes on treating complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage and amputation, which are often preventable. Their Impact Diabetes report, published in the journal Diabetic Medicine, also considered the indirect costs to individuals living with the condition, including those related to increased death and illness, the loss of income from stopping work, and the need for informal care. It found the total associated with these extra burdens in addition to direct patient care in the UK stands at £23.7 billion and is predicted to rise to £39.8 billion by 2035. There are around 3.8 million people living with diabetes in the UK and this is expected to increase to 6.25 million in just over two decades. Barbara Young, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said: 'This report shows that without urgent action, the already huge sums of money being spent on treating diabetes will rise to unsustainable levels that threaten to bankrupt the NHS. 'But the most shocking part of this report is the finding that almost four-fifths of NHS diabetes spending goes on treating complications that in many cases could have been prevented. 'The failure to do more to prevent these complications is both a tragedy for the people involved and a damning indictment of the failure to implement the clear and recommended solutions. Unless the Government and the NHS start to show real leadership on this issue, this unfolding public health disaster will only get worse.' A Department of Health spokeswoman said: 'We agree that diabetes is a very serious illness and one that has a big impact on the NHS. 'That's why we are tackling the disease on three fronts. First, through prevention of Type 2 diabetes - encouraging people to eat well and be more active. Second, by helping people to manage their diabetes through the nine annual health care checks performed in primary care. And by better management of the condition in hospital.' The report was put together by researchers at the York Health Economic . Consortium, in partnership with charities Diabetes UK, the Juvenile .

David Cameron has urged communities to ‘seize’ the chance to welcome shale gas drilling near their homes – saying the gas sites are only the size of a cricket pitch. The Prime Minister said allowing the controversial practice of extracting gas will drive down prices for consumers, as well as creating more than 70,000 jobs. But Downing Street refused to say whether Mr Cameron would be happy to see a plant spring up near his Oxfordshire home. Doubts: Prime Minister David Cameron, on a to Cassiobury Park om Watford, urged all areas to welcome fracking for shale gas . Mr Cameron said he wanted to . challenge ‘myths’ surrounding shale gas exploration, saying there is no . evidence it is unsafe or damages the countryside. He said those living near proposed shale gas sites could potentially benefit from lower council tax bills. ‘It’s been suggested in recent weeks that we want fracking to be confined to certain parts of Britain,’ Mr Cameron said. ‘This is wrong. I want all parts of our nation to share in the benefits: north or south, Conservative or Labour.’ However, . the Prime Minister's spokesman today repeatedly refused to directly say . that Mr Cameron would be happy to have a fracking site on his doorstep . in his Witney constituency. Challenged . at least nine times, the spokesman said that the PM 'huge potential . benefits' from shale gas extraction although it was important that local . people were properly consulted. 'Ultimately, that view is as relevant in his constituency as anywhere else in the country,' the spokesman said. Protests: Exploratory drilling by energy firm Cuadrilla in Balcombe, Sussex have attracted protestors which have tried to block lorries reaching the site . Welcome: David Cameron argued that every community - north or south - had to be open to the idea of fracking taking place in their local area . Battle: The prospect of drilling across the country has pitched the government against environmental protestors . The Prime Minister spoke out after weeks of protests against a proposed fracking site near Balcome in West Sussex. He  slapped down the remarks of Lord . Howell, who caused controversy last month by suggesting shale gas . drilling should be confined to ‘desolate’ parts of the north and not . ‘beautiful’ areas in the south. Environmentalists claim the process could contaminate water supplies and even trigger earthquakes. Forty . wells are expected to be drilled before the 2015 general election, half . in the North West. There could also be widespread drilling across the . South. Dorset, Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex and Kent are also thought to . contain gas reserves. Mr . Cameron said fracking should be embraced because it would follow in . Britain’s proud tradition of having the world’s first industrial . revolution. ‘My message to the country is clear – we cannot afford to miss out on fracking,’ he said. ‘For . centuries, Britain has led the way in technological endeavour: an . industrial revolution ahead of its time, many of the most vital . scientific discoveries known to mankind, and a spirit of enterprise and . innovation that has served us well down the decades. ‘Fracking is part of this tradition – so let’s seize it.’ The Prime Minister said fracking should be embraced because it would follow in Britain's proud tradition of having the world's first industrial revolution . He told the Daily Telegraph: ‘If we don’t back this technology we will miss a massive opportunity to help families with their bills and make our country more competitive.’ Energy bills would fall if we can lower our dependence on imported gas, he added. ‘Latest estimates suggest there’s about 1,300 trillion cubic feet of shale gas lying under Britain at the moment – and that study only covers 11 counties. ‘To put that in context, even if we just extract a tenth of that figure, that’s still the equivalent of 51 years’ gas supply.' Mr Cameron also quoted one study which predicted 74,000 jobs could be created in drilling and other businesses which would supply the new industry. He said fracking would bring money to local neighbourhoods, because 1 per cent of the revenue will go straight back to residents who live nearby. And he vowed to make the case that ‘fracking is safe’ – saying there is no evidence that it could contaminate water supplies or trigger earthquakes. He added: ‘One myth still remains – that fracking damages our countryside. I just don’t agree with this. ‘I am proud to represent a rural constituency. I would never sanction something that would ruin our landscapes and scenery. ‘Shale gas pads are relatively small – about the size of a cricket pitch. But more than that, similar types of drilling have been taking place for decades in this country. ‘The South Downs National Park is one of the most beautiful parts of Britain and it has been home to conventional oil and gas drilling since the 1980s. The huge benefits of shale gas outweigh any very minor change to the landscape.’","PM challenging ‘myths’ surrounding .

Upset: Aditya Mukerjee, pictured, who is of Indian origin but lives and works in New York, was traveling to LA to meet his family when he was refused to board . A New York-based Hindu man was barred by JetBlue from boarding a Los Angeles-bound flight recently, even after TSA cleared him to fly. Aditya Mukerjee, who is of Indian origin but lives and works in New York, was traveling to LA to meet his family for an annual pilgrimage that involves a week 'visiting temples, praying' and spending time with friends and relatives. But he ended up being detained for four hours at JFK, according to a blog post that has since gone viral, and was questioned by TSA, NYPD, FBI and Homeland Security before JetBlue refused to let him board the plane. The ordeal began when Mukerjee, a data scientist who has worked at NYU, declined to go through the airport's milimeter wave detector, something he regularly does as a frequent flyer, and opted for a routine pat down instead. During the procedure, Mukerjee's hands were swabbed with a 'cotton-like material' used to check for explosive residue. For some reason, he thinks it may have been anti-bedbug spray he had used the previous day while moving house, Mukerjee's sample set off the machine, sparking a frightening series of events for the young man. In his extensive blog post entitled 'Don't Fly During Ramadan,' he explains how he was quizzed extensively about his vacation, and the interrogation intensified once he revealed he and his family would be 'visiting some temples.' The week he was traveling just happened to be the last week of Ramadan, which he believes may have had the authorities and the airline on particular edge as he thinks they thought he was Muslim. He describes how he was detained for hours without food or water and interrogated by nearly every federal law enforcement agency. 'You'll have to understand, when a person of your... background walks into here, traveling alone, and sets off our alarms, people start to get a bit nervous,' one FBI agent told him, he writes. 'I'm sure you've been following what's been going on in the news recently. You've got people from five different branches of government all in here - we don't do this just for fun.' JetBlue: 'We regret the embarrassment and inconvenience this caused our customer but stand by our crewmember's decision,' JetBlue said in a tweet . But he said the thing that upset him the most was how JetBlue treated him, after he had been cleared by authorities to fly. He explained that after the fourth time he was patted down, a female TSA agent asked for his baggage claim ticket. 'I handed it to her, and she told me that a woman from JetBlue corporate security needed to ask me some questions as well. I was a bit surprised, but agreed.' He said the JetBlue representative walked in and introduced herself by name before asking him whether he had flown JetBlue before. 'Yes,' he said. She relied 'How often?' and he said about 10 times. She paused, then asked, 'Will you have any trouble following the instructions of the crew and flight attendants on board the flight?' Shocked as to why this would be in doubt, he replied 'No.' 'We have some female flight attendants. Would you be able to follow their instructions?' she went on to say. Mukerjee wrote in the blog: 'I was almost insulted by the question, but I answered calmly, ""Yes, I can do that.""' Viral: The passenger's blog post has gone viral since the event and prompted a firestorm on JetBlue's Twitter account . 'Okay,' she continued, 'and will you need any special treatment during your flight? Do you need a special place to pray on board the aircraft?' He wrote: 'Only here did it hit me,' referring to the fact the woman seemed to think he was Muslim. He said he responded 'No,' with a light-hearted chuckle, 'trying to conceal any sign of how offensive her questions were' and then thanked her anyway. 'She left the room, again, leaving me alone for another ten minutes or so. When she finally returned, she told me that I had passed the TSA's inspection. ""However, based on the responses you've given to questions, we're not going to permit you to fly today.""' Mukerjee stood in disbelief. The TSA and the NYPD had cleared him to board the plane, 'but JetBlue had decided to ground me,' he wrote. JetBlue agreed to refund his ticket, but wouldn't allow him to fly that day, forcing him to purchase a ticket with another airline that cost him an additional $700. Mukerjee's post went viral on Thursday, prompting a barrage of angry tweets to JetBlue's Twitter account. 'We don't control security screening,' JetBlue's account handler told one critic demanding an explanation. 'We regret the embarrassment and inconvenience this caused our customer but stand by our crewmember's decision,' the carrier told person. A third tweet blamed Mukerjee's 'disposition at the time' for the decision to ban him from boarding. A JetBlue spokesperson told MailOnline on Friday: 'We stand by our decision.'","Aditya Mukerjee, who is of Indian origin but lives and works in New York, said he was detained for four hours before JetBlue told him he couldn't fly that day .

ESPN has pulled out of a documentary collaboration with Frontline which examines head injuries sustained by football players and the response of the NFL that has been in the making for 15 months, allegedly due to pressure from the NFL. The sports network, which cited a lack of editorial control for its decision, is owned by the Walt Disney Company and broadcasts Monday Night Football, a big money spinner for Disney. According the The New York Times, two insiders say that ESPN came under immense pressure from the NFL to pull out of the project after a trailer for the documentary was released August 6. Grave concern: The documentary ESPN has pulled out of will discuss evidence that the NFL knew head injuries sustained by football players lead to permanent cognitive disability . Frontline, the respected longform journalism series, had been working with ESPN on the documentary for more than a year. It was due to air in October. According to the two insiders, last week NFL and ESPN top brass convened at a Manhattan restaurant for a meeting in which league officials expressed their displeasure with the direction of the documentary.

Greg Aiello, a spokesman for the NFL said that the lunch meeting had been planned long in advance and that 'At no time did we formally or informally ask them to divorce themselves from the project.' ESPN also denies having been pressured to drop the highly anticipated project. League of their own: The planned documentary is called 'League of Denial: The NFL's Concussion Crisis' 'The decision... was not a result of concerns about our separate business relationship with the NFL. As we have in the past including as recently as Sunday, we will continue to cover the concussion story aggressively through our own reporting,' said a statement released by the company. But producers of Frontline say that ESPN had been aware of and agreed to the rules of the collaboration, which stipulated that Frontline had editorial control of the content it televised or put online, and that ESPN, likewise, would control the content released under its banner.

A couple branded the 'middle class squatters' have been found guilty of an attempted £3.5million fraud, just four years after their last conviction. Richard Jerome, 66, and wife Hazel, 62, posed as as wealthy expatriates and made several fake cash offers on exclusive properties in an attempt to allow them to move in before the sale went through. The couple, from Towcester, Northamptonshire, were convicted for a similar stunt in Cambridgeshire in 2009, and changed their names so as not to be caught out as they moved their scam to Devon. Con artists: Richard and Hazel Jerome, who were convicted of fraud in 2009 after posing as a rich couple looking for a new home so they could find empty properties to squat in, are accused of carrying out the same scam in a different part of Britain . In a carbon copy case of their 2009 scam, the pair - described to the court as 'habitual confidence tricksters' - would squat at the vacant houses until they were evicted by force. During a trial at Exeter Crown Court jurors heard that Jerome embarked on his latest scam just days after he was released from jail for a similar con. Posing as an international financier working with Unesco, he told estate agents and property owners he and his wife had just returned from Caribbean tax exile and wanted to resettle in the UK. In reality, she was a retired teacher and he was a former minicab driver with less than £200 in his bank account. In 2009, the Jeromes duped two couples into allowing them to live in their Milton Keyne's properties without charge for 18 months. History repeats itself: The fraudulent couple arrives at court in 2009 when they were convicted for fraud the first time round . After making cash offers, the couple made up different lies top they explained delays in the house purchase - and ask to rent in the interim but never handed over any money. Mr Jerome was jailed 15 months after he admitted fraud and deception, and his wife was . given a 10-month suspended term after she too admitted fraud. After Mr Jerome's release from jail the couple gave false names so media reports about their earlier scam would not show up in searches. But they were rumbled after a surveyor chased them for payment and uncovered their real identities. Both denied eight counts of fraud by making false representations as to their available funds. First stay: The Jerome stayed rent-free in this house in Bradville, Milton Keynes for a year before their 2009 conviction . Target: The couple have also previously been convicted of squatting for six months in this cottage in Stoke Hammond, Buckinghamshire . But a jury found the pair guilty of fraud and Jerome was remanded in custody by Judge Erik Salomonsen, who branded him a 'menace'. He said: 'You know the score. You are a confidence trickster. You are a menace. 'You were a menace when you were convicted before and you continue to be a menace.' Jerome's wife was bailed but warned that she too may face jail when the couple, from Towcester, Northamptonshire, are sentenced next month.

The price of single train tickets could be halved, it has emerged - although the price of a return could rise in order to pay for it. The Department for Transport has been in contact with the Treasury and train operators to discuss the possibility to slash the price of a single fare. But the bill looks set to be paid for by taxpayers' expense and mean return ticket . costs might be pushed up. Could rail fares be slashed? The price of a single ticket could be halved but return tickets pushed up to pay for it . At the moment single fares match the price of return journeys. Train companies could be given millions of pounds to organise the change as it would alter their operating licences. Currently, the Treasury is considering discussing paying a significant amount for a change in fares - but where this money would be found is unclear, and could mean the scrapping of other services to raise the cash, The Times said. Pilot schemes may begin over the next few months. Last week it emerged that train fares could rise by more than nine per cent next year for some train journeys. It follows an average rise of 4.2 per cent on rail network in 2013 and increases twice that size on some popular routes. The talks about single train fares come as part of a review into Britain's rail prices. But how the commuting public will feel about the potential drop in singles but rise in returns remains to be seen. The Treasury is in talks wit the Department for Transport and train companies about the potential change . Passenger satisfaction with Britain’s crowded, late-running and over-priced railway network has plummeted to the lowest level in six years, a damning survey by official watchdogs revealed in June. One in eight passengers said they were unhappy with their unreliable rail services at a time of inflation-busting fare rises and bumper bonuses for rail bosses. Only four out of ten - 42 per cent - believe train companies give value for money while just 38 per cent are satisfied with their ability to deal with delays. The report by consumer watchdog Passenger Focus said rail companies are ‘failing to deliver on their basic promises’ to deliver a reliable time-table and that train travellers deserved a better deal. It comes after it was revealed last month that five rail bosses are set to receive £11million over three years in an extraordinary deal that critics condemned as rewarding failure. The top executives at Network Rail could share bonuses of £5million on top of their six-figure salaries, despite years of dismal performance and inflation-busting fare rises. The taxpayer-funded firm is currently facing a £75million fine for missing its punctuality targets for long distance services. Network Rail, a not-for-profit company, has also been dogged by constant complaints over crowded trains and fare rises. Its five bosses were already earning salaries of between £348,000 and £577,000 a year, with annual bonuses worth up to 60 per cent of their basic income. But in July a new 'long-term incentive' payment was agreed. This additional bonus will be paid at the end of three years and is worth a maximum of a full year’s salary, depending on performance. The new element was rubber-stamped at the company's annual general meeting in Cardiff. Santander has made the most of a gap in the market following rail hikes with a cashback credit card that enables cardholders to get 3 per cent off the cost of future trains back. What do you get? Money back: Santander is offering cashback on rail fares . Santander’s 123 Credit Card allows for money . to be claimed for train tickets bought at stations or online with any . rail company, as well as for season tickets and London Underground . tickets. The small print . There are loopholes. There is a £300-a-month limit on which you can claim back money and those travelling in Northern Ireland are barred from claiming back on tickets booked online with NI Railways. Purchases . not eligible for cashback include TfL travelcards, passes and Oyster . Card top ups made at newsagents, garages and off-licences. Eurotunnel Le . Shuttle and train tickets bought through travel agents or tour . operators are also excluded from the deal. There . is a £24 annual fee which is waived for the first year using a fairly . complicated refund system. To qualify for this refund you must open or . hold a 123 Current Account and set up a direct debit from the 123 . Current Account to pay your 123 Credit Card within 30 days. The . annual fee charged for the first year will then be refunded to your 123 . Credit Card account within 21 days from the later of either activating . your card and/or setting up the direct debit from your 123 Current . Account. Cardholders will have to think carefully as to whether, on balance, the high annual fee cancels out savings made from cashback. There is also a high APR of 22.8 per cent - so make sure you pay off your full balance every month to avoid interest. Additional benefits . Cardholders also benefit from a lucrative cashback scheme on a range of household bills.

Re-arrested: Rolf Harris was held last week while answering bail, after three women in Australia came forward . Rolf Harris was re-arrested on suspicion of new sexual offences after three women came forward in Australia, it emerged today. The 83-year-old was questioned last week over ‘further allegations’ made to Operation Yewtree detectives, after police in his home country passed on the information to Scotland Yard. Harris, from Bray in Berkshire, was arrested for a second time last week after answering police bail and learning he faced additional claims. The Australian Federal Police today confirmed to MailOnline that they are helping with the investigation. The entertainer, who was first arrested in March,  is said to be in 'complete shock' about the new allegations and has vowed to 'fight them'. In May at least two Scotland Yard detectives flew to Australia to interview a Sydney woman, named locally as Lauren Martell, 43, as part of their investigations into the allegations against Harris. The woman did not say she was a victim, but had told the police she was a witness. In the following days it is understood that two more women came forward and gave statements to the Met who were helped by Australian detectives. Scotland Yard declined to comment today and the Australian Federal Police said their officers were helping the Met with their inquiries. 'This is a massive blow to Rolf,' a source close to him told the Daily Mirror. 'He fully denied the original allegation but the fact that more people have come forward has come as a complete shock. 'He completely denies all of the claims against him and will fight them.' Harris is being dealt with under the 'others' strand, meaning the allegations have no link to shamed DJ Savile . Rolf Harris, 83, was pictured performing this month at the Wickham Festival in Hampshire . Police insisted that the allegations remain unconnected to paedophile Jimmy Savile, who sparked the Yewtree inquiry. The Australian-born star is the biggest name to be arrested as part of the inquiry into historic sex offences. He was first questioned under caution when he attended a police station by appointment in November last year. His original accuser is a woman who claims she was sexually assaulted by him when she was a teenager. Harris’s wife of 55 years is the Welsh sculptress and jeweller Alwen Hughes, 81. The . artist and singer received a rapturous reception from fans when he . performed on London’s South Bank and in Bristol this year. Earlier, . a leaked email from his Sydney-based brother and manager Bruce Harris . revealed the family’s frustration at the pace of police investigations. Writing . to a friend, Bruce said: ‘This has been dragging on for nearly seven . months. The Plod in the UK are certainly taking their time.

Marc Carpenter, 33, threatened police with a squeezy windscreen sponge like this one (file photo) A man has been charged with possessing an imitation firearm – after threatening police with a windscreen sponge. Marc Carpenter, 33, is said to have brandished the ‘weapon’ in a busy children’s play area in Exeter and allegedly told armed officers that he had a gun in his holdall. It was later found that the fake gun was in fact a squeezy sponge for car maintenance, Exeter Crown Court heard. The unusual charge led to the judge questioning if the alleged crime had been properly labelled. The incident took place on July 10, just hours after Prince Edward had opened an nearby activity centre at Haven Banks, Exeter. A member of the public reporting that a man was brandishing a gun next to a children's playground on the quayside, and half-a-dozen armed policemen swooped in on the scene. Bare-chested Carpenter invited police to shoot him, but allowed officers to handcuff him after an hour-long standoff. Judge Francis Gilbert QC said the fake gun was 'a windscreen sponge, squeezy' and that in his opinion, Carpenter should be charged with threatening behaviour or wasting police time. Carpenter, from Exeter, was remanded in custody and will return to court in a week after the charge is reviewed by prosecutors. Questionable crime: Judge Francis Gilbert QC at Exeter Crown Court thought Carpenter should be charged with wasting police time instead of possessing imitation fire arm . The stand-off took place next during one of the hottest days of the year and dozens of members of the public witnessed the incident. ‘There were lots of armed police and people looking on,’ a witness told Exeter Express and Echo at the time. ‘Someone was on the ground and the police were pointing weapons. ‘The armed police appeared no more than 15 yards away from a busy children’s play area.'

Too busy to boil an egg?  No need to worry, because one supermarket is about to sell ready-to-eat, hard-boiled eggs. For carbohydrate-avoiders in a hurry, they might be the perfect answer, but if you're sitting next to someone on a bus who gets one out, you may not be so sure. This week Waitrose will start selling individual, hard-boiled and peeled eggs at 69p each. Hitting the supermarkets this week: Individually-wrapped, ready-peeled hard-boiled eggs will cost 69p each . Given that a dozen free range eggs at the supermarket cost £2.92, or 24.5p each, you are paying more than double for the convenience of someone else having boiled it and peeled it for you. But producers The Original Egg Company, who say are sure their  low-carb, low-fat, and high protein eggs Snack Eggs will be a hit. And they reckon they've already tackled the nasty sulphur smell that often accompanies hard-boiled eggs, by packaging them with an absorbency patch to soak it up. Original Egg Company managing director Maria Paice told MailOnline: 'The convenience food market is a huge growth area right now, and we think this will appeal to all sorts of people. 'Our research shows that men who go to the gym like to snack on eggs, as well as people on low carbohydrate diets, and they will also be good for picnics and children's packed lunches.' The eggs will have a shelf-life of up to eight days, similar to egg mayonnaise in sandwiches. Or you could DIY: Delia Smith recommends cooking an egg for six to seven minutes if you want it hard-boiled .

He said: 'The food-to-go market is a . destination shop for many customers to Waitrose and being able to offer . this unique, single ready-to-eat snacking egg is very exciting.' Ready-boiled eggs have been tried before - in 2009 the Happy Egg Company launched a two-pack of them for 89p, but the product was criticised for its smell and excess water in the packaging.

Boris Johnson’s hopes of building a brand new London airport have suffered a major blow after the world’s biggest airlines refused to leave Heathrow. The London Mayor has called for the West London airport to be bulldozed and replaced with a brand new hub on the Thames. But all of the major global alliances of airlines have baulked at the idea of abandoning Heathrow as part of plans to increase airport capacity. Blow: London Mayor Boris Johnson has called for Heathrow to be bulldozed and flights moved to a new hub airport, but airlines are refusing to budge . Staying put: British Airways is among the world's leading airlines refusing to leave Heathrow . The Davies Commission is due to . deliver its first report to the Government by the end of this year and . its final report by the summer of 2015. After furious protests from local people, at the last election the Conservatives vowed to oppose Heathrow expansion. But David Cameron ordered the Davis Commission to explore the best option for expanding capacity. Last month Heathrow bosses unveiled their radical plans for a four runway ‘super-hub’ handling up to a million flights a year. They . revealed three options for a controversial new third runway to double . annual passenger numbers — and win the race to be Europe’s main . international hub airport. The Davis Commission could recommend the UK having a second hub alongside Heathrow, with at least one of the airlines alliances moved elsewhere. But British Airways has insisted it . wants to stay at Heathrow, and has the backing of the Oneworld alliance . which it leads and whose members also include American Airlines, . airberlin and Iberia. Members . of the Star alliance, which includes Germany's Lufthansa, America’s . United Airlines and Singapore Airlines, is moving to Heathrow’s new . Terminal 2 next year and does not want to go elsewhere either. A . spokesman said: ‘This will allow us to effectively compete with the . other alliances in Heathrow and add to the quality of our services, and . therefore we do not see any opportunity for us to make a change to . another airport.’ The SkyTeam alliance which includes Air France-KLM, Delta Air Lines of the US and China Eastern has also ruled out leaving Heathrow, the FT reported. Tae Joon Kim, SkyTeam's vicepresident of airport services said in a letter to the Davies commission, ‘Relocating to another London or UK airport is not an option for our members.’ London Mayor Mr Johnson has claimed the idea of Heathrow being the major hub London needed was 'crackers'. And environmentalists criticised proposals for Heathrow expansion, though bosses say bigger and cleaner planes and quieter and reducing car and vehicle pollution around the airport will make it better than at present. Colin Matthews, Heathrow’s chief executive, said: ‘After half a century of vigorous debate but little action, it is clear the UK desperately needs a single hub airport with the capacity to provide the links to emerging economies which can boost UK jobs, GDP and trade. ‘It is clear that the best solution for taxpayers, passengers and business is to build on the strength we already have at Heathrow. ‘Today we are showing how that vision can be achieved whilst keeping the impact on local resident to an absolute minimum.’ Each of the options will mean compulsory purchase of some properties, and some property demolitions, while there might have to be major work done on the M25 to accommodate a new runway. There will also need to be a sixth terminal at Heathrow, with a new runway meaning the airport will be able to handle 130 million passengers a year rather than the current figure of 70 million. Heathrow executives said they did not think there would be a need for a fourth runway at Heathrow until at least 2040.","Three big alliances baulk at idea of moving to new hub on the Thames .

But now an application to sell alcohol at the naturist spa has left Conservative councillors and neighbours worried that a licence will attract 'trouble makers'. The Clover Spa and Hotel in Erdington, Birmingham, has submitted a request to Birmingham City Council to serve alcohol. Spotlight: An artist's impression of the Clover Hotel and Spa, which opened in 2011, and wants to serve alcohol . Unusual: Tim Higgs opened Clover Spa in a 1920s former private residence after struggling to find decent naturist spots in the UK . But while the owner says that he only wants to be able to serve guests a glass of wine with their dinner, there has been objections about the application. Councillor Robert Alden fears that an alcohol licence would turn the spa into a strip club and that it would attract 'local youths and trouble makers'. He is especially concerned because the hotel is next to a children's nursery, surrounded by family homes and a soon-to-be finished retirement village. 'There is a risk of anti-social behaviour affecting neighbours whose gardens back on to the spa,' he said. 'There will be a rise in inappropriate behaviour and displays of flesh. Controversial: Councillor Robert Alden fears that an alcohol licence would attract 'local youths and trouble makers' One councillor said granting the application would result in 'a rise in inappropriate behaviour and displays of flesh' 'We have already had complaints over recent years, passed on to the council about people being nude in the garden and being visible from neighbouring properties and the nursery. 'Having clients who have had a few drinks will only worsen this situation.' Councillors Gareth Moore and Bob Beauchamp are also opposed to the application. And a resident, who has not been named, has written to the council about their objections stating: 'We believe that naturism (predominately male), alcohol and children should not be in close proximity.' The note also points out that The Clover Spa's website states: 'We do not hold a licence to sell alcohol because we wish to promote the healthy aspects of Clover Spa.' But Tim Higgs, owner of the spa, said the objections are unfounded and that guests will only want to enjoy a glass of wine with their dinner. Mr Higgs said original planning permission was granted without any objections from neighbours . There are concerns because the hotel is next to a children's nursery, surrounded by family homes and a soon-to-be finished retirement village . 'I do not get where the objectors are coming from,' he said. 'We are talking a glass of wine with dinner or a drink relaxing in the garden. 'It is a spa, a respectful, quality establishment for naturists, not a pub, you can't just come in off the street. 'This is something extra for the benefit of customers, not a big part of the business.' He added: 'The police have visited and have been supportive, there is no objection from them. I have invited our local councillors to come and look around, but they have declined. That invitation is still there.' Mr Higgs, 56, converted the 1920s house and opened it as a spa and hotel in spring 2011. He said planning permission was granted without any objections from neighbours.

Clifford Bardelli tried to sell two endangered black rhino horns worth about £15,000 as he struggled to pay his mortgage . A man tried to illegally sell £15,000 of endangered black rhino horns as he struggled to pay his mortgage, a court heard. Clifford Bardelli, 52, had been given two pieces of horn as keepsakes by his former boss when he worked as a silversmith. But when his long-term partner left him Bardelli contacted two Chinese herbalists and tried to sell them - despite being told it was illegal. He was caught out when one of the herbalists retrieved his details after he called - by dialling 1471 - before passing them on to the police. Officers found a lump of horn weighing 54g along with a second bigger piece, weighing 173g, which was found buried about six feet down in his garden. Experts said the two together were worth £14,756 but 'unsophisticated' Bardelli was trying to sell them for just a few hundred pounds. Magistrates in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, heard how Bardelli used the pieces of horn in his previous career as a silversmith where the animal parts are traditionally used to shape metal. Rhino horn does not make marks on the metal like other materials. Bardelli, who now works as a landscape gardener, said when he left the job his boss gave him the two pieces knowing he was a keen collector of fossils and artefacts. Prosecutor Rob Coyne said Bardelli, of Sheffield, called a Chinese herbalist in March saying he had some black rhino horn and 'asking her several times if she wanted any'. He said: 'She dialled 1471 and it was a Sheffield number. She informed the police.' Police later found that Bardelli had also visited a second Chinese herbalist in Sheffield offering her the horns. He told her they were from South Africa and claimed they were worth £1,000 but was 'willing to do a deal'. Bardelli admitted two charges of offering for sale parts of an endangered wild animal at Sheffield Magistrates' Court (pictured) Defending, Paul Metcalfe said Bardelli was unable to pay his mortgage after splitting up with his partner. He told the court: 'What he was asking for was nothing like the value of these things. A couple of hundred pounds was all he was after. 'This was an act of foolish desperation. It was unsophisticated.' Bardelli admitted two charges of offering for sale parts of an endangered wild animal. The magistrates ordered forfeiture of the two rhino horns and handed him a community order with 240 hours of unpaid work. They also imposed a tagged curfew between the hours of 8pm and 6am and ordered him to pay a £15 victim surcharge. Experts said the two horns together were worth £14,756 but Bardelli was trying to sell them for just a few hundred pounds. File pictures shows black rhinos in Zimbabwe . Chairman of the bench Alan Law told him: 'We struggled to decide what type of sentence is warranted in this. 'But clearly this is a very serious offence, the value of it and the fact that it is an endangered species. 'This is something we have to set an example about. 'You lied to the police. You continued to try to sell this material despite knowing what the circumstances were.'","Clifford Bardelli was given the two pieces of horn by former boss .

Britain is operating a secret listening post based in the Middle East which collects emails, phone calls and web traffic on behalf of Western intelligence agencies, it has been reported. The existence of the facility reportedly came to light following the leaks made by US fugitive Edward Snowden. The site accesses web traffic by tapping into underwater fibre optic cables connecting the region to the internet. The location of the site has not been reported. The existence of the base was revealed in leaks made by US fugitive Edward Snowden (pictured) Fears it could be discovered was one of the reasons the Government asked the Guardian to destroy hard drives containing a copy of the Snowden files, according to The Independent. The operation is part of a wider GCHQ surveillance and monitoring system, code-named Tempora, a £1 billion scheme to monitor communications around the world. Information collected at the installation, which the Government has reportedly described as an important tool in the West's 'War on Terror', is sent to GCHQ's headquarters in Cheltenham and shared with the National Security Agency in the US. Content is held in storage 'buffers' before being sifted for material of particular interest. The listening post was established under the last government under a warrant signed by former foreign secretary David Miliband. The warrant authorised GCHQ to collect information about the 'political intentions of foreign powers', terrorism, proliferation, mercenaries and private military companies, and serious financial fraud. Information collected at the installation is sent to GCHQ's headquarters in Cheltenham (pictured) and shared with the National Security Agency in the US . The issue is revisited every six months and can be changed by ministers at will. GCHQ officials are free to target anyone who is overseas or communicating from overseas without further checks or controls if they think they fall within the terms of a current certificate. The Independent said the information about the project was contained in 50,000 GCHQ documents Mr Snowden downloaded during 2012. Much of the material reportedly came from an internal Wikipedia-style site called GC-Wiki. Unlike the public Wikipedia, GCHQ's wiki was generally classified Top Secret or above. In a statement published by The Guardian, Mr Snowden denied being the source for the Independent report. He said: 'I have never spoken with, worked with, or provided any journalistic materials to the Independent. The journalists I have worked with have, at my request, been judicious and careful in ensuring that the only things disclosed are what the public should know but that does not place any person in danger. 'People at all levels of society up to and including the President of the United States have recognised the contribution of these careful disclosures to a necessary public debate, and we are proud of this record. 'It appears that the UK government is now seeking to create an appearance that the Guardian and Washington Post's disclosures are harmful, and they are doing so by intentionally leaking harmful information to The Independent and attributing it to others. 'The UK government should explain the reasoning behind this decision to disclose information that, were it released by a private citizen, they would argue is a criminal act.' The Foreign Office has refused to confirm or deny the accuracy of the reports, saying only that it did not comment on intelligence matters. Counter terrorism police last night started a criminal investigation into thousands of secret intelligence files obtained by The Guardian newspaper. Scotland Yard said documents seized from David Miranda, partner of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, contained ‘highly sensitive material ... which could put lives at risk’. Carrying documents that could be useful to terrorists carries a maximum ten-year jail sentence under the controversial Terrorism Act 2000. Officers who questioned the 28-year-old Brazilian for nearly nine hours at Heathrow have now begun an international investigation into how he was carrying ‘tens of thousands’ of pages of material including secret files leaked by ex-CIA analyst Edward Snowden.","Site accesses web traffic by tapping into underwater fibre optic cables .

'I don't think many girls would like the spiders in my bedroom so I don't bring many girls home,' he said. Liam's obsession with animals began when he saved up enough pocket money to buy a hamster when he was just six years old. Since then, he and his parents have splashed out £8,500 on his staggering hoard of pets which he buys online, from rescue centres and from exotic pet shops. He has a total of 306 animals ranging from the smallest baby golden knee tarantula measuring just 3mm to the largest exotic corn snake at 6ft 3in long. The family also have two Labradors called Sam and Max and a cocker spaniel named Thornton. Liam, who is studying animal management and welfare at Moulton College in Northampton, added: 'I spent four years trying to convince mum to get me a snake and, one year on, I had six snakes, ten spiders, and 200 other animals. 'I always watch TV with a snake around my neck, but I have given our local shopkeeper a real fright by turning up with my python. 'The next time I went into the shop, there were two signs on the shop door, one saying ""no dogs"" and one saying ""no reptiles"". 'I think the worst bite I got was from a small galliwasp lizard which latched on to my hand through a glove. 'Most of the bites and stings aren't that bad, you just have to know how to handle the animals.' His mother, 45, added: 'Liam is totally obsessed with all his animals. 'I hate spiders and would never hold one, yet he wakes me up to bring me the shed skin of a tarantula at midnight. 'Last week, I found a cricket hopping about in the shower cubicle when I went to take a shower - I'm dreading what I might find next.' And father Nigel, 52, revealed he had the shock of his life recently when he found two king snakes mating in the downstairs toilet. He said: 'Liam was looking for somewhere warm for the snakes to mate and Jayne had just put the radiator on in the downstairs loo, so he put them in there. 'I was scared stiff when I went to the toilet, sat down and had two snakes looking up at me. 'But Liam loves his animals and despite our reservations, me and his mum support him all the way.'

Joshua Stephens, 22, a 'sadistic' father who hit his newborn daughter and admitted he had an overwhelming desire to cause her pain . A sadistic father has been jailed for four years after he beat his newborn daughter and told police he wanted to cause her pain. Joshua Stephens, 22, was violent towards the unnamed baby for the first six weeks of her life before he confessed to his wife about what he had done. Among the most brutal acts he carried out, Stephens held a pillow over the child's face and forced her head under water while giving her a bath. Stephens, from Mirfield, West Yorkshire, was told by a judge that he posed a significant risk to the public after hearing that he had slapped the girl 'as hard as you would hit a man'. After admitting to his wife what he had done, Stephens went to a police station and told officers he had an overwhelming desire to hurt his daughter. He was jailed for four years and told he must serve an extended licence period of four years upon his release after pleading guilty to cruelty to a child and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Sentencing Stephens on Wednesday, Judge Geoffrey Marson QC said: 'It is obvious that these incidents occurred as a result of your sadistic desire to cause pain and distress to your daughter. 'This was a gross breach of trust on a vulnerable child.' The horrifying abuse came to light on September 4 last year when Stephens hit the youngster 'as hard as he could' when she woke up crying for a feed. His daughter was left with a bruised cheek from the blow. His wife was out of the room at the time and he admitted what he had done when she returned. Sentencing Stephens at Leeds Crown Court (pictured), Judge Geoffrey Marson QC said: 'It is obvious that these incidents occurred as a result of your sadistic desire to cause pain and distress to your daughter' He also told his wife’s father about what he had done before going to a police station and telling an officer: 'I hit my daughter and smothered her.' He underwent a psychiatric assessment and told a doctor that he had a history of self harming from the age of 14 and had strong urges to punch objects and use knives. The doctor diagnosed Stephens as suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder and was prone to impulsive and unpredictable behaviour.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 13:15 EST, 2 March 2012 . Tragic: Zoe Anderson died from carbon monoxide poisoning . A gas fitter whose faulty boiler installation led to the carbon monoxide death of a millionaire's daughter has been convicted of her manslaughter. Andrew Hartley fitted the new boiler into Zoe Anderson’s Bath home less than two weeks before she was overcome by gas fumes. The 37-year-old had already admitted a charge of breaching gas safety regulations by failing to secure the boiler flue pipe with screws. But a jury at Bristol Crown Court today found Hartley guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence following his 'rushed' and 'botched' job on the appliance in December 2010. During the trial the court heard that Miss Anderson, 24, the daughter of magazine tycoon Chris Anderson, was found dead by her boyfriend in the shower room of her father’s home in Sion Hill - one of Bath’s most exclusive streets. At first it was thought the neuroscience graduate had slipped and banged her head, but later it was found she had collapsed from carbon monoxide poisoning. The prosecution said Hartley - who was paid more than £2,000 - did a 'rushed' and 'botch' job, failing to secure the flue pipe correctly, if at all. Miss Anderson died within just 30 minutes of being exposed to the carbon monoxide after fumes leaked from the flue pipe connected to the boiler in the garage of the Victorian townhouse. Hartley, who was wearing a dark suit, showed no emotion as the jury forewoman returned the verdict, although his wife, sitting in the public gallery, burst into tears and had to be comforted by friends. Prosecutor James Townsend told jurors: 'The only person who really knows how the installation went is Mr Hartley - he was the man who fitted the boiler. 'Initially no-one knew what had caused Zoe’s death - it appeared to be a mystery - but after an examination by a pathologist it was clear she had died from carbon monoxide poisoning. Bond: Zoe Anderson and her father, the multi-millionaire media mogul Chris Anderson . 'When the boiler was working, instead of the fumes going down the piping to the outside they were being blown out into the garage rather than the flue pipe. 'The extension pipe should be firmly fitted to the turret flue elbow and in addition the extension piping should be secured in the turret elbow with the use of screws. Andrew Hartley, pictured arriving at Bristol Crown Court during his trial, was found guilty of manslaughter . 'The only explanation for the boiler leaking the fumes within days of the fitting can be that it wasn’t attached at all in the first place or if it was, it wasn’t left fitted correctly.' Carbon monoxide had been 'pouring' into the house since the boiler was fitted on December 16, Mr Townsend said. Miss Anderson had been in America visiting her father while the boiler was fitted but returned to Bath on December 27 and complained the new boiler was not working and the house was freezing. She was due to meet a friend at the cinema the next night at 8pm but failed to turn up. The next day her boyfriend, Alastair Uhlig, travelled from London to meet her but when he turned up at the house he could not get inside. After going to Miss Anderson’s mother’s house to find a spare set of keys, he returned to the townhouse where he found his girlfriend lifeless in the shower room. Hartley was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and admitted he had neglected to fit screws to the extension pipe but maintained the boiler had been correctly fitted. He suggested the flue pipe had become disconnected during the cold weather. Mr Townsend added: 'The prosecution say the explanation, a desperate explanation, was put forward by the defendant to try to explain the botched job he had undertaken. 'The failure to fit the screws, a tiny but important job in its own right, was a serious measure of indication of the defendant’s attitude to the job.' Hartley, who has been in the gas and plumbing industry for 20 years and had an unblemished career, was said by colleagues, acquaintances and friends to be reliable, professional and trustworthy. Zoe had been planning on meeting a friend on December 27, but never showed up and couldn't be contacted . Promise: Zoe was four days from flying out to New York to start a new job, her father Chris told the court . He told jurors that he admitted a . charge of contravening gas safety regulations, which reflected his . failure to secure the flue pipe with screws. However, he denied he was grossly negligent and said he felt 'awful' about not carrying out the installation properly. 'I didn’t complete it the way I should have done because I didn’t put the screws in,' Hartley said. He said that when he left Mr Anderson’s home the Worcester boiler was working properly and he had fully tested it. Father-of-three Chris Anderson, who was in court to hear the verdict, previously took to the witness box on the first day of Hartley’s trial. He proudly told the jury of seven women and five men how his eldest daughter had been due to fly to her 'dream job', as an intern at Foursquare, in New York, four days after her death. Judge Neil Ford QC, The Recorder of . Bristol, released Hartley, of Bath New Road, Radstock, Somerset, on bail . for the preperation of reports until sentencing in April.

When they opened a tea shop in a wealthy village, the owners expected to play host to nothing more than the well-to-do locals and a few tourists. So imagine their shock when they arrived at work one morning to find a swarm of cockroaches scuttling round the shop. Around 50 of the bright red insects had been posted through the letter box overnight. Shocked: Magda Wencel and Diane Bryant at their tea shop in Cookham, Berkshire, were shocked at the attack . They are believed to have been the Madagascan hissing variety, which can grow to three inches long and move very fast. The attack happened less than two weeks after business partners Diane Bryant and Magda Wencel opened the Teapot tea shop in Cookham, on the banks of the Thames in Berkshire. The pair have no idea who is to blame, but one line of inquiry is that it could have been a business rival. Police have said that because of the close-knit nature of the community, they will gladly receive anonymous information about the crime, which led to the immediate temporary closure of the cafe for hygiene reasons. A pest controller was called and police have collected samples of the cockroaches in the hope that they can be traced to the perpetrator following scientific testing. In Britain they can be bought only from pet shops specialising in rare creatures because they have to be bred and kept in precise conditions. Shocked: The attack happened less than two weeks after the business partners opened the tea shop . Mrs Bryant, 43, said of the attack: ‘It’s a disgusting thing to do, it’s vicious. We are a brand new tea shop. For someone to do this is just vile.’ 'It’s a disgusting thing to do, it’s vicious. We are a brand new tea shop. For someone to do this is just vile' Diane Bryant . But she added that they have been ‘overwhelmed’ by support from the residents in Cookham. Locals include World Cup-winning rugby coach Sir Clive Woodward, singer Chris Rea and TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson. Mrs Bryant said: ‘Everybody has been knocking on the door and they are absolutely shocked by what has happened.’ Madagascan hissing cockroaches come from the south-east African island and are sold by specialist breeders for around £20 for a batch of 50. If one is disturbed or alarmed it makes an unpleasant hissing sound by breathing through an airhole. Probe: Police have said that because of the close-knit nature of the community, they will gladly receive anonymous information about the crime, which led to the immediate temporary closure of the cafe . The cockroaches can climb surfaces including glass, making them extremely hard for exterminators to kill once there has been an infestation. Although the tea shop had to close, it was open for business again the next day after receiving a clean bill of health. The Teapot has opened next door to a delicatessen that serves coffees, and there is another tea and cake shop further down the high street. Several pubs on the same road also serve cream teas, as do a few other cafes in the village. Cookham is a popular base for picturesque walks by the Thames. Author Kenneth  Grahame lived in the parish as a child and is said to have been inspired by the river to write The Wind In The Willows. The artist Sir Stanley Spencer, who described Cookham as a ‘village in heaven’, lived and worked there, and several of his works hang in a gallery close to the Teapot.","Diane Bryant and Magda Wencel opened tea shop in Cookham, Berkshire .

A U.S. Army sergeant will spend the rest of his life in a military prison for the slaughter of 16 Afghan villagers - one of the worst atrocities committed by U.S. soldiers during 12 years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, 40, pleaded guilty in June to charges he killed the civilians in their huts during a nighttime rampage in March 2012. In exchange, prosecutors agreed not to pursue the death penalty. On Friday, a military jury at Joint Base Lewis-McCord in Washington returned a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole for the father of two. However, furious Afghan survivors of the attack said they would be satisfied by nothing less than Bales' execution and said that they were unhappy he was allowed to escape with his life. Scroll down for video . Life behind bars: Prosecutors said Robert Bales, 40, should have only one title for the rest of his life - 'prisoner' Fury: The Afghan villagers who flew 7,000 miles to Washington state to testify against Bales said they would be satisfied with nothing less than the death penalty for Bales . Sorry: Courtroom sketch shows Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales on the stand on Wednesday. He apologized to the families of the 16 villagers he murdered . Prosecutor Lieutenant Colonel Jay Morse, though, pushed for life in prison. 'He wiped out generations and he ruined . lives forever. He should . be known by one official title from this day until the day he dies: . inmate.' Bales' mother, sitting in the front row . of the court, bowed her head, rocked in her seat, and wept. An . interpreter flashed a thumbs-up sign to a row of Afghans who . were either injured or lost family members in the March 11, 2012 . attacks. Bales himself, wearing a dress blue Army uniform, showed no expression as the sentence was handed down. He became emotional yesterday as he . testified that he was angry and afraid when he left his military outpost . and ventured alone into the village in Kandahar province in . Afghanistan. The villagers he murdered were mostly women and children. 'I'm truly, truly sorry to those people whose families got taken away,' he said Thursday. 'I can't comprehend their loss. I think about it every time I look at my kids.' Nine survivors from the Afghan village were flown to Washington state to testify against Bales. He said he hoped his apology would be translated for them. However, all of them decided to stay away from the court when Bales testified.

Hajji Mohammad Wazir, who lost 11 family members, says the villagers wanted Bales executed . Bales said the massacre was 'an act of cowardice, adding: 'I'm a mass of fear and . bulls*** and bravado.' The . soldier, who was on his fourth deployment to a combat zone, said he was . mad at himself for being angry all the time, drinking too much and . hiding his problems. Bales . was nervous when he took the stand as the final witness in the hearing . at which his lawyers have tried to paint a sympathetic picture of the . soldier to contrast his own admissions and the testimony of angry Afghan . villagers about the horror he wrought. Former . pro football player Marc Edwards testified as a character witness, . telling jurors he remembered Bales as a great leader from their high . school days in Norwood, Ohio. Wearing the Super Bowl ring he won . with the New England Patriots in 2002, Edwards said the slightly older . Bales was an 'unbelievable leader' who 'took me under his wing' on their . high school team. Bales was even magnanimous when Edwards took his position at starting linebacker, he said. 'He . came up to me after that practice kind of sheepishly,' said Edwards, . who played nine years in the NFL. 'He says, ""Hey Marc ... I want the . team to be successful.""' The . jurors on Thursday also heard from an Army officer who served with . Bales in Iraq. Major Brent Clemmer said it was unfathomable to learn . that the competent, positive soldier he knew could have committed the . atrocity. 'I walked myself into my office, poured myself a glass of scotch, and cried,' he said. A brother of the soldier testified at . Bales' sentencing hearing, on Wednesday, portraying him as a patriotic . American, high school class president and football team captain. Sentencing: Courtroom sketch shows Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales on the stand in his defense under questioning by his civilian attorney Emma Scanlan, right, as judge Army Colonel Jeffery Nance, center, looks on on Thursday . Victim: In this courtroom sketch, an Afghan man named Faizullah, about 30 years old, testifies about how his father, Haji Mohammad Naim, and brother Sadiquallah were shot and wounded when Staff Sgt. Robert Bales attacked their village in Kandahar Province . 'There's no better father that I've seen,' William Bales, 55, said of his younger brother. 'If you brought the kids in here today, they'd run right to him.' William Bales repeatedly referred to his sibling — once the captain of his high school football team and class president in Norwood, Ohio, where they grew up — as 'my baby brother' and 'Bobby.' He described how as a teenager his brother cared for a developmentally disabled neighborhood boy, assisting him with basic life functions. The neighbor's father also testified about Bales' helpfulness. 'I don't know too many 16-, 17-year-old boys who could do that,' William Bales said. On Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning, nine Afghan villagers who traveled about 7,000 miles to testify at the hearing in traditional garb spoke of their lives since the attacks. Pained: In this courtroom sketch, Haji Mohammad Naim testifies Tuesday, August 20, 2013, about how Bales attacked his village and one other in pre-dawn raids on March 11, 2012, killing 16 civilians . Haji Mohammad Wazir lost 11 family members, including his mother, wife and six of his seven children. He told the six-member jury that the attacks destroyed what had been a happy life. He was in another village with his youngest son, now 5-year-old Habib Shah, during the attack. 'If someone loses one child, you can imagine how devastated their life would be,' said Wazir, who received $550,000 in condolence payments from the U.S. government, out of $980,000 paid in all. 'If anybody speaks to me about the incident ... I feel the same, like it's happening right now.' His son, now 5, 'misses everyone. He hasn't forgotten any of them.' 'I've gone through very hard times,' he added. Wazir and a cousin, Khamal Adin, didn't get to say everything they wanted to in court. Each asked for permission to speak after the prosecutors' questions were finished, but the judge said it wasn't allowed. Two military doctors testified Wednesday, describing the treatment of Bales' victims, including a young girl who had been shot in the head and spent three months undergoing surgeries and rehabilitation at a naval hospital in San Diego, relearning how to walk. Rampage: Bales, right, a father of two from Lake Tapps, Washington, was serving his fourth combat deployment when he attacked the two villages solo . Bales' attorneys, who have said the soldier suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, didn't cross-examine any of the Afghan witnesses. Bales, a father of two from Lake Tapps, Washington, was serving his fourth combat deployment when he left the outpost at Camp Belambay in the pre-dawn darkness. He first attacked one village, returning to Belambay only when he realized he was low on ammunition, said prosecutor Lieutenant Colonel Jay Morse. Bales then left to attack another village. The massacre prompted such angry protests that the U.S. temporarily halted combat operations, and it was three weeks before Army investigators could reach the crime scene. If he is sentenced to life with the possibility of parole, Bales would be eligible in 20 years, but there's no guarantee he would receive it. He will receive life with parole unless at least five of the six jurors say otherwise.","Staff Sergeant Robert Bales described his killing spree as an 'act of cowardice' on Thursday as he testified in his sentencing at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington .

The final winner from among the three tickets that struck gold with all the matching numbers in this month’s $448 million Powerball jackpot has finally come forward. The world already knew the third ticket had been sold in South Brunswick, New Jersey, but Mario Scarnici was not revealed to be the winning ticketholder from the August 7 drawing until Friday. Scarnici’s name was buried deep in a New Jersey Lottery press release that listed winners of lesser amounts as well as the other winners from the historic August jackpot. Scarnici chose a lump sum cash option totalling $62 million after taxes. Solved: There was no name on this cake displayed at the South Brunswick, New Jersey grocery store celebrating its sale of one of three tickets for the August 7 $448 million jackpot, but it has now been filled in . Scarnici, who lives in the Monmouth Junction area of South Brunswick, claimed the prize along with his two adult sons, according to New Jersey Lottery spokesman Judith Drucker. According to CentralJersey.com and Drucker, details on the lucky winner are scant. This, paired with his apparent unwillingness to appear at a celebratory press event suggests Scarnici and his sons have no intention of publicizing their luck any further. The same cannot be said for the other winners. The first winner of the massive jackpot wasted no time in coming forward to claim his prize. Name and a place: The Stop & Shop in South Brunswick, New Jersey sold one of three winning tickets for the third largest Powerball jackpot in history to Mario Scarnici . Still mysterious: Scarnici's name was slyly buried a page into a New Jersey Lottery press release Friday. Unlike the other winners, he has not held a press conference . A day after the numbers were picked, Paul White and his elated girlfriend and coworkers came forward at a Minneapolis press conference. The beaming Ham Lake, Minnesota divorcee and dad held a novelty check made for the news cameras and envious public. The next winning ticketholders to go public at least waited a few days to get their ducks in a row before their press conference. But come forward they did. Jubilant: Quite unlike Scarnici, one of the other winners, Paul White (here with partner Kim VanReese) of Minnesota all but ran to a press conference following his win . The Ocean’s 16, a group of 16 public employees from Toms River, New Jersey came forward the following week to claim their chunk of the winnings. Like White had already done and Scarnici would soon choose to do, the Ocean’s 16 chose a lump sum. Each will get about $3.8 million after taxes, Drucker said. One among the 16, garage worker William Seeley, even achieved fleeting internet fame following the win. Modest: William L. Seeley. an outspoken fan of Duck Dynasty and one of the Oceans 16 who won the other third of the jackpot holds their novelty check aloft . I quit: Sixteen New Jersey municipal workers won a third of the $448 million jackpot as a group, only the second time two jackpot winners came from the same state . Sporting a floppy straw hat covered in fishing lures, a T-shirt promoting the popular A&E reality show Duck Dynasty, camouflage pants, sun glasses and a long beard, Seeley gleefully proclaimed that he and his 15 co-workers were a ‘happy bunch’ at a New Jersey press conference. 'We're very happy, happy, happy,’ Seeley, said as he held a giant yellow check aloft and channelling the bearded Duck Dynasty patriarch Phil Robertson. But for every Seeley and White, it seems, there is a Scarnici and we may never truly know the man behind the historic lottery win. The August 7 drawing marked only the second time two Powerball jackpot tickets have ever been sold in the same state. In 1993, two winners came from Washington, DC.","Like the other winners, Mario Scarnici will take the same $62 million lump sum, but unlike them has declined to appear at any press events .

The gang intended to throw packages of drugs and mobile phones to their inmates using an 8ft metal frame with an elastic sling attached (here's the Nokia Lumia 925) - and even tried hurling potatoes over the walls to test their weapon . One man held the catapult, while the other pulled the huge elastic band back. It was identified as a ‘Wild Sling’ catapult designed for use with water balloons and sold online. The third man acted as a spotter and was on the phone to the intended recipients inside the jail. They would pass on directions to adjust the strength and angle of the weapon depending on the results of the test firings. A prison source said: ‘Apparently, the three suspects started their operation by firing potatoes into the prison, in order to calculate trajectory and distance. ‘One suspect held the base of the catapult and one was firing the objects. A third suspect was directing operations using a mobile which he used to liaise with a prisoner inside the jail.’ The source added: ‘The discovery by the alert officers at the jail prevented a significant supply chain of drugs, mobile phones and other contraband from criminals outside to the prison.’ Police have been called in and are investigating the incident. Insiders said the find suggested an organised supply network at work with ‘resources, planning and determination’ Officials said they had disrupted a ‘significant contraband supply chain from the criminal community to the prison’. Prison staff have struggled to disrupt the supply of drugs into Britain’s prisons. Often packages are simply tossed over the wall into an area frequented by inmates. Lags use illicit mobile phones to arrange the drop so they are there at the right time. Prison chiefs have tried to block mobile phone signals around jails but have struggled to get the technology to work. Inmates have been known to hide drugs and even mobile phones inside their body to try and get them in to jail. Several prisons are fitted with x-ray chairs to spot hidden goods. In other cases, corrupt prison officers are used to smuggle the goods inside. It is estimated the trade in drugs inside prisons could be worth £100million a year. Some inmates have complained it is easier to get drugs in jail than outside, and said they did not develop a habit until they were locked up. Ministers have launched ‘drug free wings’ in an effort to crack down on supply and allow inmates to get clean. A Prison Service spokesman said: ‘This demonstrates the significant lengths criminals will go to in order to smuggle contraband into our prisons, and demonstrates the excellent work carried out by vigilant staff to foil this attempt. ‘This is indicative of the way in which we are succeeding in tackling the problem of illicit items being smuggled into prisons.’ Anyone caught trying to get drugs or mobile phones into prisons may find themselves behind bars if convicted.’","The catapult alert sounded at unnamed prison in the Midlands .

Thousands of sixth- formers are opting to take a tough research-based qualification on top of A-levels amid a collapse of confidence in the exam. More than 30,000 teenagers are expected to submit dissertations under the Extended Project Qualification this year, a six-fold increase in four years. The qualification can be used as a ‘tie-breaker’ between university applicants with similar A-level results, or to decide whether to admit someone who has failed to meet their grade offer. Thousands of sixth- formers are opting to take a tough research-based qualification on top of A-levels amid a collapse of confidence in the exam . The work, which is worth the equivalent of half an A-level, is usually presented as a 5,000-word report in an academic subject ‘outside their main programme of study’. It requires a high level of independent work and original thought – skills which universities complain are lacking in school leavers. Private schools in particular have recognised the value of the exam and around 6 per cent of pupils took one last year, a third more than in 2011. Barnaby Lenon, chairman of the Independent Schools Council, said: ‘My guess is that the number of students taking them will continue to increase. Ofqual research has revealed that universities are keen to see an increase in independent research and learning. There is an inadequate amount at A-level, so EPQs are absolutely up universities’ street. ‘Some universities also find A-levels not stretching enough for the most able students. The EPQ does stretch them.’ Just over 5,000 EPQs were submitted in 2009. This leapt to 16,000 the following year and 24,000 in 2011. Last year 28,500 students sat the qualification, which is offered by five exam boards and uses the same grading system as A-levels. Of these, 14 per cent were awarded an A*, 19.3 per cent an A and 19.8 per cent a B. Education Secretary Michael Gove is reforming A-levels after the gold-standard exam suffered from years of grade inflation . Elite universities said EPQs can make the difference between winning a place on a course or just missing out. But institutions outside the research-intensive 24 Russell Group universities are also increasingly relying on them. Education Secretary Michael Gove is reforming A-levels after the gold-standard exam suffered from years of grade inflation. Modular work is being replaced by exams at the end of courses. The number of resits is also being limited. But the changes will only be introduced from 2015, meaning it will be several years before students sit more rigorous exams. The Extended Project Qualification was introduced in 2008. Students can choose the topic they research but it must be an academic area not specifically covered in their other studies. Someone studying French and geography could write about the impact of tourism on the  environment in a region of France, for example. The qualification takes a year during which students receive 120 ‘guided learning hours’ and undertake ‘extended autonomous work’.","Comes after collapse of confidence in exams after years of grade inflation .

A council's decision to cut down wooden stakes from a play area over fears children might snap them in half has been branded 'utter madness'. Parents clashed with council leaders after workmen removed the wooden stakes from the English Civil War-themed park which commemorated a famous local battle. Killjoy health and safety officers ruled the pillars, . in Power Park in Worcester, were dangerous because children could injure themselves if they climbed up them. Overreaction: Parents accused Worcester City Council of being 'health and safety zealots' after advising that stakes (one of which is circled in red in this picture taken in 2011) should be removed from the play area . Barmy: The council's view that the stakes posed a risk was ridiculed by one parent who said it was 'utter nonsense' The stakes were put up in 2011 as part of a revamp of the park, run by St Peter’s Parish Council, with £50,000 funding for the project coming from landowners Worcester City Council - the same authority that has now deemed the stakes a risk. A Worcester City Council spokesman said: 'The concern was that the poles were not wide enough in diameter to withstand children swinging on them. 'The poles were in danger of snapping when children played on them. 'The play area was installed and run by St Peter's Parish Council. The work to cut back the posts was also carried out by them. 'Worcester City Council's only . involvement was as the landlowner, and in that role we advised the . parish council that the poles were not wide enough for their purpose and . therefore were a potential danger to children playing there.' Hacked off: The fence used to have 8ftft spikes on, but was cut down to size by over-zealous council health and safety officials because it was feared a child might hurt themselves . Father-of-three Andrew Howell, 45, from Worcester, said: 'It's utter nonsense that these stakes were a health risk. 'The . children would have to shimmy up the poles to reach the spikes and . then somehow hurl themselves onto them - it's ridiculous. 'The . stakes were put up around the play park to commemorate the Civil War . and they were a good learning tool for children while they played in the . park. 'Ironically, what we . now have is the posts cut down to about waist height but they are more . of a hazard with kids tripping over them. 'When . I contacted the council about the removal of the stakes I was told . there was a risk of children impaling themselves on them. 'Once again the council have proved themselves to be health and safety zealots.' Historic: The 8ft tall spikes surrounding the play area were supposed to be a tribute to the pikemen of the English Civil War who fought in the famous nearby Battle of Worcester in 1651 - until council workmen cut them down . Amateur photographer Bill Meadows, 77, . from Worcester, who took pictures of the park when it was unveiled, added: . 'I think it is disgusting what the council has done. 'To take them down is one thing, but now they are using them as posts, it is disrespectful. In my opinion, they are not dangerous, it is just health and safety gone mad. 'The spikes were like a fort for the children to play around, I am sure the children are disappointed about what has happened. For the council to just cut them down is madness. 'The . way they have cut the spikes has left them more dangerous than they . were before, they are now quite sharp and could catch children who are . not concentrating.' Worcester City Councillor Roger Knight also opposed cutting down the display. He . said: 'I am disappointed that they had to be cut down to two feet high . when they were quite splendid and built to resemble the pikemen of the . Battle of Worcester in 1651.' Concerns: Officials feared children might, somehow, snap the thick wooden spikes which were standing in Power Park, in St Peter's, Worcester . Taxpayers' Alliance today branded a council decision to cut the stakes down as 'barmy.' Robert Oxley, Campaign Director of the . TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'It's utterly barmy that Worcester City . Council has forked out so much taxpayers' cash on revamping the park, . potentially only to spend more undoing some of that work. 'Too . often health and safety rules are cited as a reason for stopping . children from having fun, regardless of whether there are genuine risks. 'Yet, if the spikes pose a . danger to children the question has to be asked why they were included . in the design in the fist place, let alone erected.' But Worcester City Council earlier defended the decision. A spokesman said: 'Children and young people were getting onto these spikes and pulling them down. Some of them were being snapped off. 'A health and safety inspector thought it was not appropriate and that they should be made safe.'","Parents brand council 'health and safety zealots'

The first official Barry's Bootcamp and Mahiki 'Saturday night dance party' will launch in the capital on August 31 and there is a different theme every week, such as back to school, Fifty Shades Of Grey and Magic Mike. The opening night will be a back to school theme and the studio will be decorated like a classroom, the lead trainer will be a teacher, other trainers will dress as prefects, and regular clients are monitors. There will be an intense work-out while a live DJ from Mahiki spins motivational tunes and there's even detention for those who quit exercises early. The workouts are tough, 60 minutes of . hardcore cardio on Woodway treadmills, . teamed with strength training using weights, bands and your own body.

But the grandfather is now in a permanent state of . happiness – after a stroke left him unable to feel sadness. The . stroke interfered with the part of Mr Myatt’s brain that regulates . emotional responses, leaving him liable to erupt in a fit of giggles at . the most inappropriate of times. He . has sat through funerals smiling broadly or cracking jokes, and during . meals out with wife his Kath, 63, he regularly attracts puzzled looks . from fellow diners. Malcolm Myatt (pictured with his wife, Kath), 68, was left with little feeling in his left side after he suffered a major stroke in 2004. Until he had the stroke he was fit and healthy . But while the condition could be devastating for some, Mr Myatt said yesterday he sees his joyous disposition as a blessing. The 68-year-old said: ‘I’ve always been a happy person and loved telling jokes, but now I don’t ever feel sad. ‘I remember that I used to be able to feel sad, if something bad happened – but it just doesn’t happen any more. He added: ‘I would definitely rather be happy all the time than the other way round.’ Mr . Myatt was healthy and working as a lorry driver when he was struck down . with the stroke in January 2004 as he made breakfast. Doctors told Mr Myatt, and his wife, that the stroke had hit the frontal lobe of his brain that controls emotions, and the couple realised it meant he could no longer feel sadness . Mr Myatt said: 'I am never depressed. Being sad wouldn't help anything anyway. I would definitely rather be happy all the time than the other way round. It's an advantage really' Mr Myatt spent 19 weeks in hospital after his stroke and his wife was told to prepare for the worst. He realised he was unwell when he tried to carry a cup of coffee upstairs and spilled it . It affected the right frontal lobe – . the part of the brain that controls  emotions and motor function on his . left side – and doctors initially feared the grandfather-of-two would . not pull through. Mr . Myatt, from Cannock, Staffordshire, spent 19 weeks in hospital and has . no function in his left arm and  can only walk short distances with the . aid of a stick. The pensioner is now in the early . stages of vascular dementia, triggered by a reduced blood flow to the . brain following the stroke. Mrs . Myatt and the couple’s daughter, Beverley Lloyd, 31, yesterday said  Mr . Myatt’s condition meant he was unable to curb his happy persona, and . sometimes left them feeling like they were living with a child. Mr Myatt's short term memory has also been affected by the stroke and he has lost his ability to judge what is, and what is not, an appropriate thing to say. (Pictured with wife Kath on their wedding day.) But . while the condition can be trying at times for the family, they said . the couple’s grandchildren, Aaron and Dominic, can’t wait to visit their . ‘hilarious’ granddad. Mrs Myatt added: ‘Malcolm doesn’t cry, he just doesn’t know how to be sad anymore. ‘But he’s infectious. When he starts laughing everyone in the room does. ‘We have been to funerals and I’ve been on tenterhooks wondering what he might come out with.’ Dr . Clare Walton, research communications officer at the Stroke . Association, said: ‘While we haven’t heard before of stroke survivors . completely losing the ability to feel a particular emotion, many find it . very difficult to control their emotions and may cry or laugh at . inappropriate times.’ Mr Myatt (pictured with his grandson, Dominic) loves to tell jokes.

Emily Davison (1872 - 1913), a few days before her fatal attempt to stop the King's horse 'Amner' on Derby Day to draw attention to the Women's Suffragette movement . She is remembered as the suffragette who died under the King’s horse. But it has always been unclear as to whether Emily Davison really did intend to kill herself at the Epsom Derby in 1913 – or whether she simply wanted to make a public stand. Now new evidence has emerged to suggest the latter, after local historian Maureen Howes spent ten years working with the activist’s family to discover the truth. Both she and Davison’s surviving . relatives are convinced that it was nothing more than a tragic accident, . and are determined to set the record straight. Davison died in hospital four days after being knocked down by George V’s horse, Anmer, at Tattenham Corner. It . is a common theory that rather than seeking martyrdom, she had merely . attempted to tie the Suffragette’s colours to the horse. Mrs . Howes’ research suggests that it was only by coincidence that Davison . had decided to do this – as earlier, safer, protest plans had been . scuppered. Her conclusions . have been drawn after trawling through previously unseen mementoes, . photographs and documents from family members, and listening to . anecdotes. She said: ‘At the . time of Emily’s death, the family found all the publicity too much. It . was very unpleasant. They were reluctant to speak out. ‘The . story is so well-known but no-one has found out the truth. I’m happy . with what I have written but I know it will upset a few apple carts. The suffragette throws herself under the horse in the 1913 Derby . Davison slipped under the rails and walked straight into the colt's path . The militant suffragette and martyr to the cause of the political advancement of women, had a favourite quotation: 'Rebellion against tyrants is obedience to God.' ‘People want to declare Emily as a suicidal fanatic but I have a very different version of the Epsom Derby. ‘She doesn’t deserve the legacy which has been given to her.’ According . to Mrs Howes, Davison resorted to running onto the track as a ‘plan B’ after an attempt to pin the colours to a horse in the paddock failed. Maurren Howes has produced a new book on the subject . She said ‘plan A’, the safer option, was scuppered when Davison was recognised and barred from entering the pen. She said: ‘She didn’t commit suicide. There’s no chance of it. It was just a tragic accident. ‘She put herself in a risky position, but it was a plan B. ‘She was meant to pin her colours to the horse in the paddock but they didn’t let her in. ‘It . was then decided to go for went for plan B - she probably thought, if . we can’t do it in the paddock, let’s do it at Tattenham Corner where the . news reel is.’ Mrs Howes . said it was well-known within the family, based in Morpeth, . Northumberland, that Davison had practised pinning colours on horses in . local fields before the event. In . addition, it was only by chance that she was the person given the job . of pinning the suffragette colours to the King’s horse on the fateful . day. Mrs Howes said the . Morpeth Suffragettes drew straws during practice on Morpeth Common to . decide who would pin the suffragette colours to the King’s horse, and . Davison drew the short straw. Davison . had also let it be known that she was intending to travel to Paris . after the Epsom protest to help her sister, Letitia, care for her . three-month-old baby son Josse.

It has been published to help mark the 100th anniversary of Davison’s death in June 1913. She tracked down family members by using her genealogy skills and posting adverts in the local paper. She said: ‘The family took me in as one of their own. They wanted to get their stories out before they get too old. ‘They wouldn’t trust anyone before they met me. I’m not political or academic, I just want to get the truth out.’ After . Davison’s death, the coroner recorded death by misadventure rather than . suicide – but it was widely thought that she had acted intentionally.

A 38-year-old man has been arrested over the murder of a teenage girl who was found strangled in a pond 20 years ago. Jason Tibbs has been charged with murdering 16-year-old Rayna Rison in La Porte, Indiana, in March 1993. Rison's disappearance on March 26, 1993, garnered widespread attention. It was featured on ""America's Most Wanted"" and it inspired former Oakland Athletics owner Charlie Finley to offer a $25,000 reward for her safe return. Rayna's family said they were relieved to learn of the arrest has given them some closure after 20 years of wondering how her body came to be body dumped in a pond. Suspect: Jason Tibbs has been charged with the murder of 16-year-old Rayna Rison in 1993 . 'We've been stuck in the ""'Who did this . and why?"" for 20 years,' Rayna's sister, Wendy Hakes told ABC News. 'Now we know who did this. We just have to figure out the why.' After two decades, a prison confession led police to Tibbs when an inmate described seeing him remove a body from the trunk of his car, according to NWI. Rayna was reported missing by her father, Bernie Rison, after she failed to come home after her shift at an animal shelter. The day after she went missing, Rayna's car was found in a rural area several miles from her home. A week later, her new boyfriend's high school letter jacket, which she had been wearing, was found hanging from a tree. It was a month before fishermen found Rayna's body in a pond a few miles from where her car was found. Prosecutors initially charged her brother-in-law, Ray McCarty, with killing her. Three years before her death, he pleaded guilty to molesting her and was given a three-year suspended sentence that included 100 hours of community service, mandatory counseling and three years of probation. A newly elected prosecutor dropped the charge against McCarty the following year after determining there was insufficient evidence linking him to Rayna's murder. Despite the high-profile case attracting attention across the U.S. and being featured on America's Most Wanted at the time, there were no other leads. Tibbs, who went to school with Rayna, had dated the teenager and the couple remained good friends up until her death, according to NWI. He had been a person of interest early on in the investigation, according to court documents, after his ring was found in Rayna's car and letters found in her bedroom from him said he would 'go to almost any extreme' to date her again. Relief: Rayna's parents Ben and Karen Rison, and her sister Wendy with a picture of the murdered teenager . Ms Hake told ABC News: 'He wasn't interested in school. He was interested in doing other things that weren't necessarily productive for society. He liked to get in trouble.' The case was reopened about five years ago, by La Porte police. An inmate, who was 14 at the time of the murder, confessed in 2008 to seeing Tibbs drive into a barn with another man, Eric Freeman. Rickey Hammons said they had a body in the trunk of his car but he didn't report seeing it because he had been smoking drugs in the barn at the time and feared he would get into trouble. Then, two months ago, Freeman told police he saw Tibbs strangle Rayna after they had an argument, according to court documents. Despite knowing the identity of the alleged murderer for 20 years, Freeman will not be prosecuted because of a plea deal he made for his testimony. While the arrest may answer some questions for the victim's family, they said it will do nothing to ease the pain of losing Rayna. Shock: Ben Rison and Wendy Hakes say the family is reeling after being told a suspect has been arrested . The teenager's mother, Karen Rison, said: 'I don't believe there will ever be closure because nothing can bring her back.' Her father, Ben, added: 'We're still kind of reeling. It's going to take time . to absorb all of this.' Tibbs has been charged with murder and non-negligent manslaughter, according to What's New La Porte. He is due back in court on September 13. Judge Tom Alevizos entered a not guilty plea on behalf of Tibbs and ordered him to be held without bond.","16-year-old Rayna Rison was found strangled in a pond in 1993 .

The receptionist claims Dr Julius Fadipe squeezed her right breast 'out of the blue' (file picture for illustration purposes only) A GP accused of groping his receptionist’s breast claimed he accidentally touched her when reaching for printer paper. The woman told a hearing that Dr Julius Fadipe squeezed her right breast ‘out of the blue’ after she brought him a cup of tea before morning surgery. But Nigerian-born Dr Fadipe, 57, said he touched her by mistake because he reached for the paper while engrossed at his computer. ‘I was focused on the screen,’ the locum GP told a fitness to practise hearing at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester. ‘I knew where the papers were and knew where the printer was. It was just reflex going towards the printer. I felt I hit somebody. It was purely accidental. Then I noticed it was her.’ Later on the day of September 22, 2011, he was told that the woman, called Miss A to protect her identity, had reported him. Dr Fadipe was confronted by surgery bosses, but no action was taken after a trust investigation and police found there was insufficient evidence to proceed. After the alleged incident, Dr Fadipe said he recalled that Miss A ‘made some passes’ at him when he worked at the West Midlands surgery six years earlier. The married father of three claimed Miss A ‘came on to him’ three times. He said she had tried to kiss him, showed him saucy photographs and said she told him: ‘You don’t allow me to sleep at night because I was thinking about you all night.’ Miss A has denied his allegations. The General Medical Council accuses him of sexually motivated conduct and if the charge is proved he could be struck off. Peter Horgan, for the GMC, told Dr Fadipe: ‘Rather than Miss A being the one who was making a play for you, it was you for her.’ Dr Fadipe, who works in Birmingham, Solihull and Worcestershire, qualified in Nigeria in 1985. He worked in Britain as a gynaecologist from 1990 to 2002, before retraining as a GP in 2004. The hearing continues.

The roommate invited Bernard over that night to their Ditmas Park apartment. Around 3:30am gunfire was heard and Bernard came to the roommate with Tharell in her arms. Bernard claimed that the shots came from outside. But police aren't buying his story. They say that the bullet holes are only seen on his story and not in the windows. The weapon was never found, so they are also charging Bernard for tampering with evidence by possibly getting rid of it. Bernard has retained a lawyer and has not made any statements so far. A three-year-old boy is in a critical condition after being shot in the head in the early hours of Saturday morning . Neighbors said the young boy has had to endure a tough start to his young life. Several months ago he was left seriously injured when a pit bull owned by his mother's boyfriend attacked him. According to neighbors the boy is called Terrell and his mother is 40-year-old Nitchell Edwards . 'She's very irresponsible, very neglectful,' neighbor Tony Reid told the New York Daily News. 'She had a dog that bit the baby and when the baby came back from the hospital the child fell down the staircase that week. Twice that week.' The child was rushed to Kings County Hospital, where he was initially listed in critical condition early Saturday. He was later transferred to Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center and then to Cornell Medical Center, where he is listed in critical but stable condition.

Assaulted: Ray Widstrand, 26, suffered potentially fatal brain swelling after he was attacked by a gang of youths . The man who was beaten into a coma allegedly by a group of black teens as he was walking home would not want his attack turned into a race issue, his family said today. Ray Widstrand, 26, was enjoying a late-night walk through . his neighborhood on St Paul’s East Side on August 4 when he was attacked as he walked . through a group of 30 to 50 juveniles and young adults. He was hit in the head with a 'can in a sock', stomped on, had his pants ripped off him and was robbed. He was placed in a medically-induced coma when he was taken to hospital. His family said though he has not been able to talk to them yet, he would not feel comfortable people feeling sorry for him. He would want them to focus on 'positive things'. His dad Peter said: 'He's a pretty private person. It's tragic, and I don't think he'd like that. 'I think he would want all the people in the community to work for a . safer, positive community, and not tear people apart, and say it's this . race and not that race. I think people of all groups are . shocked at the violence.' His sister Alice added: 'I think he would want the world to be a better place, and not worse, with more anger and hatred.' Though he suffered 'potentially fatal brain swelling' and 'permanent and protracted loss of brain function' as a result of the beating, his family said they are encouraged by his recovery, especially after he sat up in his hospital bed and gave the thumbs up. Peter told The Pioneer Press: 'It seems every day we see some steps . forward. Every day, I see something, . whether it's in his eyes or something he does. '[But] We're still in the place where we don't know if he'll return to work or return home. We might not know for years. Progress can stop tomorrow. It might not stop two years from now.' The television producer had moved to an apartment in the Minnesota city two months before the attack and was working for a local community channel. Family support: Ray Widstrand's parents Linda and Peter spoke during a press conference alongside his sister Alice, expressing their shock and disbelief as to why Ray was attacked . Crime scene: Mr Widstrand was walking through his local neighbourhood on St Paul's East Side when he was brutally assaulted, robbed and stripped . Brutal beating: After Mr Widstrand was knocked over one person was seen stomping on his head after which a third stripped him of his trousers to search his pockets . Speaking at a press conference, his father Peter said Ray had never ‘expressed any concerns’ about living on the East Side. ‘I . can't imagine why someone would do this to another person. Hopefully . they will at least answer to that,’ Peter Widstrand added. In custody: Isaac Maiden, 19, has been charged with over the attack on Mr Widstrand . The . large group was fighting on a street located mere blocks from the local . police station and turned the violence on Mr Widstrand when he tried to . get past them, witnesses told police. A . local newspaper reported that the fight had started at a party nearby . and a group of girls had taken it to the street after which the brawl . escalated into a bust-up between local gangs. ‘An innocent man was walking down the street and brutally attacked by a group of youth,’ police spokesman Sgt. Paul Paulos, told Pioneer Press. ‘He was out for a walk and decided to go through this group and was assaulted and knocked unconscious.’ According to the police report, Mr Widstrand was hit over the head with a ‘can in a sock’ which knocked him to the ground. Witnesses reported seeing blood coming . from his head after which a second man stomped on his head while a . third removed Mr Widstrand’s trousers and the group searched his . pockets. Police found Widstrand lying on the ground, bleeding from his nose and mouth, his pants removed and shirt torn, according to a criminal complaint filed by the Ramsey County attorney's office. Mr Widstrand is reportedly in a critical but stable condition and is expected to be brought out of the coma this week, his sister told PioneerPress. 'He's in the most difficult time right now, as far as swelling and cranial pressure. We're in that critical time,' his father said. Isaac Maiden, 19, has been charged with first-degree assault, first-degree aggravated robbery and crime committed for the benefit of a gang. He is being held with bail set to $150,000 and is scheduled to appear in court this month. Maiden denies assault. A further three male juveniles have been arrested in connection to the attack but no charges have been brought against them.","Ray Widstrand 26 was attacked walking through his own neighborhood .

They might taste scrumdiddlyumptious, but new Willy Wonka chocolate bars pack more calories than almost any other brand. About to be launched by Nestle, Wonka’s Crème Brulee bar has 555 calories in every 100g – more than rivals from Cadbury’s Dairy Milk to Haagen-Dazs ice cream. Health campaigners say the calorie count is ‘unimaginable’ and warn it could have a devastating effect on children’s health. Scrundiddlyumptious: Netsle's Wonka bars- based on the Roald Dahl novel about the adventures inside a chocolate factory- pack a whopping 555 calories . Decadent: The bars come in three flavours, Crème Brulee, Millionaire's Shortbread and Chocolate Nice Cream. They contain more than a quarter of the recommended daily calorie intake . Nestle hopes to capitalise on the continuing popularity of Roald Dahl’s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with three flavours of Wonka bar, even borrowing the author’s vocabulary to call it ‘scrumdiddlyumptious’. But it says the core market will be women in their 30s and 40s. Small versions of the Millionaire’s Shortbread and Chocolate Nice Cream versions – under 40g – go on sale next month. The 100g bars launching in October include the Crème Brulee version with 555 calories. In contrast, a bar of Cadbury’s Dairy Milk contains 530 calories per 100g and Haagen-Dazs Belgian Chocolate ice cream just 285 calories in 100g. Even the least calorific of the three Wonka flavours, the Chocolate Nice Cream Wonka bar, has 524 calories per 100g – more than a quarter of the recommended daily calorie intake for women. Inspiration: Although Nestle say their new product is aimed at women in their 30s and 40s, the bars are rooted in the Roald Dahl book, which is read and loved by children. Charlie Bucket (played by Peter Ostrum, right) was given a Wonka bar by his grandad in the novel . World of pure imagination: Wonka's chocolate river is part of his fantasy world. Health campaigners said the bars could have 'devastating' effects because of their content . Nestle is pouring £3.6million into the launch and is targeting the bars at mothers aged 30 to 45 but admits they will be ‘perfect for the whole family’. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, described the calorie count as ‘unbelievable’ and said the use of words such as ‘scrumdiddlyumptious’ was clearly aimed at children. ‘I cannot see any reason or any guarantee that children won’t be getting hold of this – and for children it will be devastating.’ A spokesman for Nestle said the 100g bars were an ‘indulgent treat’ and that the labels make clear they were for sharing rather than for eating in one sitting. The firm said it takes seriously its resposibility to help it customers lead healthier lives.","Wonka's  Crème Bruelee bar contains more than a quarter of recommended daily calorie intake .

Thousands of Roma turned out for the funeral of their self-styled King as he was laid to rest in his hometown in Transylvania today. Florin Cioaba, 58, who had taken to wearing a king's crown as the leader of the minority community, became famous around the globe for arranging a marriage for his 12-year-old daughter. After watching her storm out of the church to avoid becoming a child bride, 'King' Cioaba became an advocate for education for Roma girls and began preaching that girls should not marry before the age of 16. Royal farewell: Mourners, including 'King' Florin's sons and his wife Marita, stand around the glass-roof air-conditioned coffin, during a religious service at the 'King's home . March of the Roma: Thousands of Romani gypsies followed the truck heading for the cemetery to honour their leader . Tears for the king: Female relatives of late 'Gypsy King' mourn during his funeral in Sibiu, northern Romania . The royal guard: Bodyguards stand near the glass-covered coffin during the funeral procession on Friday . This despite the fact that his dutiful daughter Ana-Maria had returned to the church moments later and was indeed married off to a 15-year-old boy of her father's choice. Cioaba died of a heart attack while on holiday in Turkey last week, and received the sendoff worthy of a royal. His body was carried in an air-conditioned glass covered coffin down a four mile route in Sibiu, Transylvania. A banner emblazoned with his crowned visage was draped across an apartment building in his hometown. Stonemasons have been carving his tomb in black marble for the last week. ‘He cared very much about his Roma community and he helped it a lot. He integrated it into Romanian society, he sent the members of the community to school,’ his relative Ion Rudaru said. Crown lost: Mourners gather around a truck carrying the coffin of Florin Cioaba, the self-styled 'King' of the Roma community, who died last week aged 58 . Community loss: The body of the 'King' was taken on a four mile funeral cortege followed by thousands of Roma . Next in line: The two oldest sons of King Florin; Dorin, right and Daniel, left, greet mourners in Sibiu . Controversial: King Florin, seen on a large banner on an apartment block in Sibiu, became a household name after forcing his daughter Ana-Maria to marry when she was 12 years old . Last journey: 'King' Florin later gained a reputation as an activist for improved communication between the Roma and the Romanian community and promoted education for young Roma girls . Regina of the Roma: 'Queen' Marita stands next to her husband's cross placed outside their residence in Sibiu, 118 miles northwest of Bucharest . The last journey: The casket of 'King' Florin Cioaba is carried by pallbearers in the cemetery at the end of the funeral march . Before the funeral, his elder son Dorin was crowned ‘the international king of Roma,’ while his younger son Daniel was crowned ‘the king of Romanian Roma,’ succeeding him as the heads of Europe's largest Roma community. Cioaba himself took over the mantle in 1997 from his father Ion Cioaba, who was deported during the Holocaust to the Soviet Union. Roma sociologist Ciprian Necula described Cioaba as a moderate leader and a mediator who used his pulpit to deliver many of his messages, including urging Roma not to beg on the streets, calling on them to wait until age 16 to be married and demanding more rights for the minority. ‘When I greeted him “I kiss your hand, Your Majesty,” he replied, “Stop that nonsense!”,’ Necula said Friday. Fit for a king: The specially made coffin was allegedly air -onditioned for the Roma 'King' New King: Dorin Cioaba, the new King of the Gypsies, kisses the hand of his mother Marita next to his father's coffin, after the crowning ceremony . Gypsy leader: Roma Gypsy women in traditional dress at wake for their late King this week . His people: An elderly Roma man takes part in the funeral of the 'King' a title Florin Cioaba had held since 1997 after his own father's death . Close-knit: Women gather at the mourning preparations in the Cioaba family home with guests arriving and visiting Florin Cioba's coffin for the last time . International leader: Musicians play in honour of 'King' Florin, praised for standing up to former French President Nicolas Sarkozy whom he denounced for repatriating Romanian Roma from France . Tradition: A Roma man throws coins for children at the funeral of 'King' Florin Cioaba in Sibiu . Cioaba was strongly influenced in his policies by his wife, Marica, whom he married when they were both 14 and with whom he had four children, Necula added. He could be critical of European leaders, including former French President Nicolas Sarkozy whom he denounced for repatriating Romanian Roma from France. There are officially some 620,000 Roma in Romania, but many do not declare their ethnicity due to widespread discrimination. Roma leaders say there are between one and three million Roma in the country.","Florin Cioaba was the 'King' of the Romanian Roma community .

A taste of Spanish tradition came to Virginia on Saturday, as 4,000 people converged on a town for the chance to run with bulls. The Great Bull Run had its debut on a converted drag-racing strip in Virginia, attracting a few thousand brave - or foolish - competitors wanting to recreate the Pamplona festival. Wearing fancy dress or traditional white shirts and red scarves, between 500 and 700 runners a time would dash down the quarter of a mile track, with 12 1,000lb bulls in hot pursuit. Charge: Runners sprint down the track as 12 bulls gallop after them . Close call: A runner anxiously looks over his shoulder as the bulls draw near . Video source YouTube Tennyshoe17 . 'It was a rush ... a shot of adrenalin,' 22-year-old Cat Jones said. 'I just didn't want to die, to get trampled by bulls and die,' the New Yorker told NBC News. Runners paid about $60 for the chance to take part and had to sign a waiver absolving the organizers of liability if they got hurt. One man was taken to hospital after being knocked to the ground and trampled and another had medical treatment after falling. Stumble: A participant, with their shoe laces undone, looks in danger of falling as the animals stampede . Injured: A man was taken to hospital after falling during a bull dash . Sprint: Bulls thunder up behind this runner . Animal spirit: A woman wears a bull mask as she prepares to take part in the run . About 8,000 spectators turned out to . watch the event, which is due to tour other states including Texas, . Florida, California and Pennsylvania. Most people who took part were aged between 18 and 40 and nearly half were women. Rob Dickens, co-founder of the Great Bull Run, said people were attracted to the event for the chance of 'doing something dangerous and living to tell the tale'. 'I’m 50 years old. There are no more dragons left to slay. It’s time to do something a little crazy,' Bill Slaughter told the Richmond Times Dispatch. Big draw: Thousands turned out to watch as about 500 runners a time raced with the bulls . Inspiration: The Great Bull Run is based on Pamplona's annual festival . A 25-year-old, whose grandfather had run with bulls in Pamplona, added: It’s in our blood. It’s exciting to be living what our grandparents did.' Animal rights groups, including Peta, had protested against the bull run, but the organizers claimed none of the animals were hurt. 'Bull runs mean collisions, falls, broken legs, trampling, and other potentially fatal outcomes for everyone involved, from the bulls to the bystanders,' Peta's Delcianna Winders said.","4,000 runners dice with death as they race with 1,000lb beasts .

A burglar chased away from a house by a 13-year-old schoolboy with a saw has been jailed after police found him cowering in a bush nearby. 'Extremely brave' Cameron Harrison, 13, was home alone in Worcester when he was woken by a noise outside his bedroom and realised the house was being burgled. After the teenager used the saw to scare off the intruder and his accomplice Darren Dowie, who was keeping watch outside, police discovered Dowie hiding in a bush close to the property. Brave: Schoolboy Cameron Harris, 13, chased off the burglar with a saw after coming face to face with the intruder while home alone in Worcester . Today Cameron told how, after he was woken by the noise, a strange man put . his head around his door - prompting the fearless schoolboy to spring . out of bed and pursue him through the house. As he ran downstairs after the intruder, Cameron grabbed a saw which had been left on the landing by builders who were repairing the floor. He found the man holding armfuls of his family's belongings - so raised the tool above his head and chased the burglar and an accomplice who was keeping watch outside of the house and down the street. Cameron did not touch either of the men with the saw but simply used it to frighten them off. After the man ran off the teenager ran back inside and phoned his mother Lisa Sawyer, 41, who called police. Jailed: The 'extremely brave' actions of the schoolboy (seen left with his mother Lisa Sawyer) saw burglar Darren Dowie (seen right with unrelated injuries to his face), 37, jailed for two years at Worcester Crown Court . 'Proud': Cameron's mother said her son was a 'hero' after he chased away the intruder and his accomplice from their home . Dowie, 37, who had been waiting outside, was caught a short time later after being apprehended in his hiding place. Yesterday Dowie was jailed for two years at Worcester Crown Court after he admitted burglary. Judge Richard Rundell told the court Dowie had been caught thanks to the 'extremely brave' actions . Today Cameron told how he leapt into action when faced with the nightmare scenario. 'I woke up after I heard a loud noise outside my room, then this man put his head around my door,' he said. 'I said ""who are you?"" and he disappeared back on to the landing. 'So I pulled on my t-shirt and shorts and started to head downstairs, but before I did I grabbed a saw to protect myself. 'When . I got downstairs the man had loads of our belongings in his hands so I . shouted to stop and just started chasing him out of the back door and . down the garden path. 'I stopped when I go to the bottom of the garden and went back to phone mum and tell her what had happened. 'He was a bit taller than me so I felt quite scared but not as much as I thought I would. 'I was just angry he was in our house and I wanted to protect the family. 'I'd definitely do it again, a lot of my mates have said they think it's great but they don't think they could do what I did. I feel proud of what I did,' the 13-year-old said. 'Bit of luck': Cameron's mother Lisa Sawyer said it was lucky that builders had been repairing the floors and left the saw behind . 'Angry': Describing his ordeal the teenager said he had felt 'quite scared', but that he 'wanted to protect the family' Mother-of-two Ms Sawyer, who has moved away from the property since the burglary on May 25, said she was proud of her 'hero' son. The deli assistant said: 'The thought of someone breaking in and going through all your things is horrible, but to actually be there when it happens must be terrifying. 'I was quite shocked when I heard what Cameron did, I thought he'd be scared but he held it together very well. 'It was a bit of luck that we were having the floors done at the time, I think the sight of him running downstairs holding a saw in his hands probably put them off a bit. 'He was a hero that day, I'm very proud of him,' his mother said. A West Mercia Police spokesman said: 'The house in the Warndon area of Worcester was broken into after the offender removed a cat flap and reached through to unlock the door. 'Two laptops, a mobile phone, money boxes and jewellery were stolen but a 13-year-old boy who had been asleep in bed was woken and chased the offender through the house and into the back garden before he lost him in a nearby street. 'The boy's mother phoned 999 and less than an hour later Darren Dowie was arrestedby police hiding in bushes a short distance from the property.' Detective Inspector Stuart Murphy of West Mercia Police said Cameron was 'extremely brave' to pursue a burglar, but added: 'We would not generally advise people to chase offenders as they may be dangerous and possibly armed with a weapon, but it is a judgement call and we recognise that the instinct of many victims will be to follow them. 'Although it is best to wait until the police arrive, in this case fortunately no-one was hurt and the quick thinking of the boy and his mother enabled us to make a speedy arrest, and return the majority of the stolen property to them.'","Cameron Harrison, 13, was home alone in Worcester when burglar struck .

These stunning pictures capture the moment a pair of zebras kick, bite and tear at each other to earn their stripes as leader of the pack. Ruthless: No mercy is spared by either party as the male zebras engage in terrifying territorial combat . The male zebras, believed to be around . four years old, were photographed engaging in the spectacular display of . male dominance in Etosha National Park in north-east Namibia, Africa. One zebra, believed to be the herd leader, is seen being antagonised and threatened by another younger male. After a couple of attempts to ignore the intruder, the pack leader strikes with terrifying power and accuracy. Attacker: A younger male is beaten back after trying to gain dominance of the herd in Etosha National Park, Namibia . While . they make very little noise during their brutal engagement, the creatures . kick up the surrounding dust while they battle it out to get to the . top. Wildlife photographer Judy Malloch camped out to watch the zebras in hoof-to-hoof combat. Mrs Malloch, 69, said: 'It was fascinating. The zebras are very frisky and love to run and jump. Don't try me: Tensions arise when a young buck tries to rile the leader of the herd with a few mocking nibbles, but the boss isn't having any of it... yet . 'One Zebra was antagonising the other - he seemed to want to challenge the male to show dominance. 'They are usually very placid but sometimes they get into combat situations where they can become very mean.' Mrs Malloch spotted the zebras among 30 others which were returning from a water hole. Upper cut: Things start to get nasty as one zebra goes for the leg and the other takes a chunk out of his opponent's ear . 'They were battling to dominate the group,' said Mrs Malloch. 'The fighting starts and it can get very aggressive. They can break another zebra's leg when they kick - it's pretty brutal. 'They fight for a while and then cool off for a bit. If it's not too hard they will come back and battle. Headlock: The two zebras, believed to be around four years old, hurl all their weight into each blow of the battle . 'They . pin each other on to the ground and then they will break up for a bit. 'One decides it's not going to give in and they go on to bite the other . around the neck and leg area. 'The others in the group stand around and watch. Some ignore it but others want to know what is going on.' All-out war: Wildlife photographer Judy Malloch took the incredible shots in the early hours of the morning . Mrs Malloch and her husband Gary travel frequently, particularly in areas with diverse wildlife. She said: 'We stayed in four different camps during our stay. 'But we wanted a safari where we are really in control and can stay in locations for as long as we need to. Steer clear: Other zebras watch from the sidelines, curious to find out who will win the bloodthirsty battle . 'The zebras were fascinating. They are beautiful and unusual. Each is one of a kind. 'They want to fight for their family and being in their prime, the zebras battling can be quite furious.' The fascinating pictures, which were taken during the morning hours, show the animals in their true natural glory. Surrender: The aggressor is defeated, order is restored, and the herd returns to its quieter state of normality . 'They are beautiful creatures,' said Mrs Malloch. 'Their creators did a great job of designing them. Each one is an individual and they're fascinating animals. 'They're very interesting to watch. They protect one another no matter what.' The fight quickly subsided as the zebras settled their differences. Mrs Malloch added: 'They got back to normal very quickly. Everything quietened down and they got back to worrying about their food. 'Luckily we didn't see anything on this occasion that resulted in damage. One turned away and gave in, before saying ""you win!"" to the other.'","Male zebras clash on plains of Etosha National Park, north-east Namibia .

Most people use their will to leave money to family and friends, charities or the church. But one mystery woman decided to donate more than half a million pounds to whoever was in power. Joan LB Edwards bequeathed a sum of £520,000 to the government at the time of her death, but with the Tories and Lib Dems in coalition the two parties had to share the cash. Cashing in: David Cameron and Nick Clegg split the money left to the government of the day . The mysterious donation emerged as the Electoral Commission published the latest donations figures for April to June this year. The huge sum left by Ms Edwards meant she was the second biggest donor to any party, behind Unite which continues to bankroll the Labour party. The Liberal Democrats said the she had left the bequest to 'the party in government of the day'. With two parties sharing power, the money was split according to their number of MPs and ministers. As the larger party, the Conservatives received £420,576 while the Lib Dems had £99,423. A Conservative spokesman said: 'We don't comment on the details of specific donations. It was out of the blue. We weren't expecting it.' It is unusual for the money to be left to the governing party of the day, regardless of who is in power. Last year it emerged dead Britons had left the Treasury £54,000 to help pay off the ballooning national debt from beyond the grave. Backer: James Palumbo, founder of the Ministry of Sound, gave £65,000 to the Lib Dems in the weeks before being made a peer . In 2010-11 members of the public gave more than £1million to the government as a gift to the nation, almost all left in wills. And £54,634.36 was specifically set aside ‘for the reduction of the national debt’. Amid growing doubts about why Ms Edwards' money was taken by the political parties and not added to Treasury coffers to spend on public services, it emerged the decision was taken by the solicitors acting as executors of her will. They consulted the Treasury solicitors and the Attorney General’s office before making the decision to treat the money as a donation to the parties, both of which were 'surprised' by the money. The decision of how to split the donation parties was made by the executors of the will. A Lib Dem spokesman said: 'The Liberal Democrats were notified that the party was a beneficiary of Ms Edwards’ will. 'The party was also informed that the executors had made the decision to split the estate between the two political parties in Government.' The Conservatives received a total of £4,116,006 during the three month period, including major donations from businessmen. The . largest gifts to the Conservatives were £280,770 from co-treasurer and . hedge fund boss Michael Farmer and £263,600 from investment banker James . Lupton. Labour said the . Tories received £1,042,970.93 in the last quarter from donors who . attended private dinners with Mr Cameron and other senior ministers. It . included £694,370 from donors in the financial sector. Sadiq . Khan MP, Labour’s Shadow Justice Secretary, said: 'The Tories have . raked in over £1 million from private dinners with David Cameron and . senior Ministers in the last quarter. 'And more than two thirds of that comes from the City – the bankers and hedge fund bosses whose taxes David Cameron cut. 'Hardworking . families are seeing their living standards squeezed, with prices rising . faster than wages. Meanwhile David Cameron shows how out of touch he . is, standing up for the millionaires who fund his party.' Meanwhile, . the new figures show the Ministry of Sound gave £65,000 to the Lib . Dems, just weeks before the nightclub's boss James Palumbo received a . peerage from Nick Clegg. The . superclub firm made a donation of £50,000 to the central party on June . 6, and on June 30 a further £15,000 was given to the Bermondsey and Old . Southwark local association of Lib Dem deputy leader Simon Hughes. Meanwhile, unions have tightened their grip on Labour and are now responsible for three-quarters of all big donations to party coffers. The Unite union, which went to war with Ed Miliband over plans to curb union influence, gave £722,195 from April to June this year. The figures also reveal that even the Lib Dems have raised more from individual non-union donors than the Labour party since the election. Red Ed: Five of the biggest trade unions accounted for three-quarters of the total donations to Labour coffers in the three months to the end of June . The revelations will heap further pressure on Mr Miliband, who has faced growing criticism for his failure to set the political agenda in recent weeks. A new opinion poll shows 40 per cent of people now back David Cameron and George Osborne to run the economy, compared to just 24 per cent for Mr Miliband and shadow chancellor Ed Balls . The Labour leader is caught between trying to widen the appeal of his party while relying increasingly on trade unions to bankroll his campaign for Number 10. The Electoral Commission today released details of all donations to political parties over £7,500. In the three months to the end of June, . Labour received a total of £3,136,447 in such donations, of which 72 per cent . came from five of the biggest unions. Unite gave £772,195, the GMB £485,830, UNISON £458,080, USDAW £411,147 and the Communication Workers’ Union £143,121. Labour stressed that the figures did not include smaller donations, and said union money accounted for 25 per cent of total donations since the start of the year. Over the period Labour reduced its overdraft facilities by £2.5 million and took out two new loans of £1.22 million each with the Co-operative Bank and Unity Trust Bank. The party had outstanding loans of £12.79 million at the end of June. By contrast, the Tories are recorded as having £2.6 million of loans but have access to overdraft facilities of up to £10.13 million. In the money: David Cameron's Conservatives received most in donations overall, while Nick Clegg's Lib Dems had more in donations from non-union sources than the Labour party, lead by Ed Miliband . Tory party chairman Grant Shapps said: . ‘Despite Ed Miliband’s promise of change, these independent figures . prove his Labour Party is still dominated by the trade unions. ‘They choose the candidates, pick the leader and remain Labour’s biggest donors - providing three quarters of the party's money. ‘Until Ed Miliband stops taking his union paymasters’ cash, he will be too weak to stand up for hardworking people. ‘Instead, . he can only offer what the union barons want in return for their money - . the same old Labour policy of more spending, more borrowing and more . debt, exactly what got us into this mess in the first place.’ The UK Independence Party was buoyed by donations more than doubling to £160,000. It included a single payment to its Tiverton and Honiton branch worth £50,000, the second highest payment to a local association of any party. UKIP has grown hugely in the last year, picking up an extra 15,000 members. Last month Unite general secretary Len . McCluskey aid out a £63billion shopping list of left-wing policies he . says Labour must adopt or lose millions in funding. He . said the Labour leader had to be ‘bold’ and reverse the coalition’s . benefit reforms, halt spending cuts and borrowing billions to build . 1million extra homes. Labour’s reliance on union backing means it now raises less from individuals than Nick Clegg’s Liberal Democrats. In the latest three months, the Lib Dems raised £801,000 from non-union donations while Labour received only £730,000. Since the 2010 general election the Lib Dems have raised £6million from individuals compared to £4million for Labour. And Mr Miliband has struggled to widen the supporter base, with only 305 individual Labour donors, compared to 1,077 for the Lib Dems. Even with the union barons bankrolling the party, Labour still received less than the Conservatives.","Joan LB Edwards left cash to the governing party of the day .

She then allegedly distributed them with the intention of encouraging others in the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism. Dawson is also accused of encouraging terrorism by publishing a statement with Barnes entitled ‘Muslim laughs at British Soldier killing’. Barnes is due to appear at the Old Bailey on Friday.

British holidaymakers needing emergency treatment at Spanish accident and emergency units are being greeted by chip-and-pin machines as hospitals force them to provide upfront payment details before care is given. Hospitals in tourist towns including Alicante and Benidorm have installed the instant payment devices even though Spain faces a hefty fine for refusing to accept European health insurance cards. The cards entitle EU citizens to emergency treatment for free, with the costs being reimbursed by the recipient’s home country. British holidaymakers are confronted by chip and pin machines for upfront payment at A&E departments in some Spanish tourist resorts . But hard-up Spain has been flouting the arrangement, with the country’s politicians blaming tourists and expats for putting strain on its health service. Twenty-five payment machines have been installed throughout the Costa Blanca and Valencia, with six in A&E departments and the rest in outpatient clinics. They are also being trialled in Navarra, a wine-growing region in the north. Officially, the machines are meant to be used to charge only patients ‘without the right to [free] treatment’. Health minister Manuel Llombart said they were introduced because hospitals were having problems chasing up bills. But hundreds of Britons have complained of being charged. Patients at the ever-popular resort of Benidorm are confronted by charges for hospital care . Josh Fryer Bloom, 15, impaled himself on a spiked fence and ruptured his groin. Blood was pouring out as he limped into the A&E at Benalmadena near Malaga with his mother Samantha Fryer. They refused treatment when faced with a demand for €450 (£387) but found a private clinic that treated him for just €35. Mrs Fryer, from London, said:  ‘I am appalled. I would expect  this sort of thing to happen in  the US, but not in the EU to a  British citizen.’ Cash-strapped Spain claimed tourists and expats were an extra strain on its health service . A  new law that came into force last September removed full healthcare rights for 873,000 working-age foreigners who had not registered to pay income tax. Some were people who had retired early and been given Spanish health cards as inducements to buy property in the boom years. But under the new rules, there have even been reports of Britons having cancer treatment stopped halfway through. A  European Commission spokesman said Spain adopted new  guidance on accepting European health cards last month. A substantial fine could follow if the EC is not satisfied with its actions.","Hospitals in tourist resorts have installed machines to collect payment .

Omar also . identified the three persons killed in the violence. ""Three . unfortunate deaths - 1 Hindu, 2 Muslim and we've a judicial inquiry . with my minister resigning. Would the BJP care to recount 2002 . response?"" Angry Omar . Soon after the violence broke out in Kishtwar, the Jammu and Kashmir government had called out the Army for a flag march in the town. ""Oh that's right they can't because their star PM hopeful waited days to call out the army and has yet to apologise. Hypocrites,"" Omar's third tweet read. The Opposition Peoples Democratic Party accused the chief minister of playing ""communal politics"" by disclosing that two Muslims and one Hindu were killed in the clashes. Party president Mehbooba Mufti said the chief minister had no business to divide victims on religious lines. ""He made it communal,"" Mehbooba said. A government spokesman said Omar has announced immediate relief of up to Rs 2 lakh each in favour of affected house owners and shopkeepers whose properties have been damaged or looted in the clashes. Unhappy with the state government's response in handling the violence in Kishtwar, the Ministry of Home Affairs has sent a law and order maintenance advisory to Omar. In the advisory, the home ministry has told the state government that the violence may spread to other parts and asked it to ensure that no such incident is repeated anywhere else. Assuring all help, the Centre said adequate forces would be deployed in all sensitive places to maintain law and order. Police on Monday arrested Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front chairman Muhammad Yasin Malik. Malik had planned to go for peaceful march against Kishtwar violence. Free hand: Defence minister A K Antony has given a clear message to Army commanders that they are free to respond to ceasefire violations as they see fit . By Gautam Datt . Fireworks are expected to intensify on the Line of Control (LoC) as the army has been given a free hand by the government to respond appropriately to ceasefire violations in the wake of the killing of five Indian soldiers by Pakistan army regulars in Poonch sector last week. The message has gone loud and clear to formation commanders by Indian Army chief General Bikram Singh and he has also advised them to remain aggressive while guarding the sanctity of the LoC. Sources said local formations have been asked to retaliate with force any violation of ceasefire through heavy fire. Apart from the LoC, even the international border has witnessed flare ups in recent days with firing also reported from the Jammu sector. Pakistan has claimed one of its civilians has been killed in the firing in Sialkot. Sources said there was no ambiguity that Pakistan army regulars were behind the Poonch killing and it was sternly conveyed to the Pakistan Army when director generals of military operations of two sides spoke to each other a day after the incident. The Indian Army will now respond at a tactical level either through heavy retaliatory firing or by making cross border raids. By Qaswar Abbas and agencies . The Nawaz Sharif government has no immediate plan to grant the most favoured nation (MFN) status to India, Pakistan finance minister Ishaq Dar said on Monday. ""There is no immediate consideration to grant India MFN status,"" Dar told Hamid Mir on Geo News program 'Capital Talk'. Denial: Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government has denied that the country's Army were involved in recent breaches of the LoC . At the same time, he stressed on normalising ties with New Delhi on a number of issues. It must be noted that India had granted MFN status to Pakistan in 1996. For the past few days, the two neighbours have traded charges regarding LoC ceasefire violations. Tension along the LoC was sparked following the killing of five Indian jawans in Poonch sector on August 6. While New Delhi has accused Pakistani troops of killing its soldiers, Islamabad has denied involvement of its forces. Earlier, there were reports stating that Pakistan has deployed additional troops in Kasur and Okara districts. The Pakistan's Defence Ministry, however, denied the reports. ""Reports suggesting deployment of Pakistani troops across the LoC or adjacent districts are not true. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif himself is in-charge of Ministry of Defence that allows deployment of troops anywhere in country. He did not issue any such directive,"" a senior official of the Ministry told Mail Today. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned Indian Deputy High Commissioner Gopal Baglay to convey its concern over BSF firing from across the LoC. ""The Foreign Office summoned the Indian Deputy High Commissioner this afternoon to raise this concern which has resulted in the loss of an innocent civilian life in Rawalakot,"" a MoFA spokesperson said.","J&K home minister Sajjad Ahmad Kichloo steps down over accusations of inciting violence .

After months of misery, the economy is on the mend – and it seems we all deserve a pat on the back. For official figures show the average worker has been doing their bit for UK plc, working an extra 18 minutes each week. The working week, which had been shrinking steadily for decades, is back on the rise,  mainly due to advances in technology, consumer demand and global competition. Hard at work: The average week has increased for both full- and part-time workers in the past year . The latest data shows that the average time worked per week has increased by almost 20 minutes in a year. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show average hours worked by all employees, full- and part-time, rose from 31.7 in the second quarter of 2012 to 32 in the second quarter of 2013. Full-time workers’ hours rose from 37.2 to 37.5 over the same period, and those for part-timers rose from 15.8 to 15.9. ‘Until the 1990s, the working week was getting shorter by about an hour every decade,’ said Jim Hillage, director of research at the Institute for Employment Studies. ‘But that seems to have stopped and reversed.’ Longer days: Figures show full-time workers¿ weekly hours rose from 37.2 in 2012 to 37.5 this year, and those for part-timers rose from 15.8 to 15.9 . Ben Willmott, head of public policy at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said: ‘I think you could argue that the trend stopped some time ago. ‘For full-time employees there was a reduction in working hours up to May 2011 from 1992. Since then hours have been stable or even edged up. ‘There was a pronounced trend from the 1950s for decades, which saw a significant reduction. During the last 20 years, the reduction has been more moderate, and then it reached a plateau.’ Hillage added: ‘The demand for people-based services has increased enormously.  This has had the effect of lengthening working times.’ ‘The use of technology has blurred the boundary between life and work,’ said Willmott, ‘with people perhaps working more out of hours but also using work time for domestic matters such as booking a holiday on-line.","The working week decreased from post-war era to the 90s .

Baroness Warsi said the talks are much-needed because 'Groups like Al-Muhajiroun and the EDL argue you cannot be British and Muslim' Muslim soldiers will be asked to deliver talks in schools to help counter extremism following the Woolwich murders. Some 650 Muslim personnel will use their experiences to convince youngsters that it is possible to follow Islam and be a patriotic Briton. Soldiers of both sexes, including those who have served in Afghanistan and Iraq and some who have been injured, will address school assemblies, particularly in areas that have seen a spike in hate crimes. Attacks and abuse against Muslims rose eight-fold in the wake of the murder of drummer Lee Rigby in May. A month later they were still running at 36 a week. The latest idea to tackle radicalism is understood to have been championed by Baroness Warsi, the minister for Faith and Communities, and plans are said to be at an advanced stage. A senior Government source said it was vital to dispel myths perpetuated by radical Islamists and far Right organisations such as the English Defence League that ‘the West is at war with Islam’. ‘This is an opportunity for men and women in uniform today – Muslim and non-Muslim – to go into schools and show that people of all faiths are serving alongside each in our army forces’, the source said. ‘It sends a really powerful message post-Woolwich – mainly because it was an attack on soldiers, but also because it condemns the extremist narrative that you can’t be a practising Muslim and a loyal British citizen serving your country in the armed forces.’ The visits will be co-ordinated around next year’s activities in schools to mark the centenary of the First World War, in which hundreds of thousands of Muslim soldiers fought and died for Britain. Educational programmes will focus on the millions of Commonwealth soldiers who served in the war – including the 1.2million Indian soldiers who fought, 74,000 of whom died. Baroness Warsi, whose grandparents fought in the Second World War, added: ‘This is particularly potent at a time when questions are regularly raised about loyalty and identity, about who genuinely belongs to this country and about our history. 'Groups like Al-Muhajiroun and the EDL argue you cannot be British and Muslim.’ Two proposals are being considered, one led by Imam Ali Omar, the Army’s new Civilian Chaplain to the Military, and the Curzon Institute, an independent defence and security advisory group. After facing dangers in Afghanistan such as roadside bombs and suicide attacks, some Muslim soldiers have also spoken of threats from extremists within their own community on their return to the UK. David Cameron declared in 2011 that the doctrine of multiculturalism had ‘failed’ and that British Muslims must subscribe to mainstream values of freedom and equality. David Cameron (left) has been criticised for not doing enough to promote peace within diverse communities and is said to have only paid real attention to the issue after the death of Lee Rigby (right) However, some in Government believe not enough has been done to ease community tensions since then. One senior Conservative said that it was not until the ‘wake-up call of Woolwich’ that the Government has taken community cohesion seriously. ‘It’s been a long battle to even get the issue recognised’, the source said.","650 soldiers will give talks on how it is possible to follow Islam and be a patriotic Briton .

Former Newcastle United striker Nile Ranger has agreed to pay a £5,000 fine - the equivalent of 216 minutes' work - instead of completing community service because he is too busy searching for a new club. Ex-Newcastle United striker Nile Ranger, pictured outside Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court last Tuesday, has agreed to pay a £5,000 fine rather than complete community service because he is too busy finding a new club. The 22-year-old, was ordered to complete 120 hours of community service and nine months supervision by Newcastle Magistrates after admitting common assault in April. Ranger - who was released by Newcastle in March where he was paid £7,000 a day - said he keeps missing probation meetings because he is touring the country meeting football chiefs and agents. Highbury Corner Magistrates have agreed to change it to a £5,000 fine because Ranger is desperately scouring the country for a club that will take him. He follows in the footsteps of fellow striker Carlos Tevez, who paid a £3,000 fine instead of doing community service for a driving conviction because he was moving from Manchester City to Juventus. Ranger - who now earns £30 a day - skipped more than half of the court-ordered appointments and completed just 14 hours community service since he was sentenced in April, the court heard. Ranger attacked his then-girlfriend Shakira Bicar in Newcastle city centre, pulling her hair during a row in the street. He was hauled back into the dock last week after missing two appointments in July without giving any reason at all for his absence. 'After the imposition of the order, the defendant had a total of 29 appointments, out of which he managed to attend 13', prosecutor Mahmudul Amin told magistrates. 'Eight have been for the supervision requirement, and five for the unpaid work requirement. He has been credited with 14 hours' work. 'He also had 13 acceptable absences - the high number of acceptable absences is because Mr Ranger is a professional footballer. 'He was previously a professional in Newcastle playing Premiership football for Newcastle United, but his contract was terminated in March this year. 'Some of the acceptable absences are on dates of appointments Mr Ranger had with football agents. 'He has been traveling to different towns in England in order to try to secure a contract.' Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court heard Ranger, pictured playing for his former club, has missed half of the court-ordered appointments and completed just 14 hours of community service since he was sentenced in April . Mr Amin said the heavily tattooed striker, who recently had his own surname inscribed on his forehead, breached the court order when he thought a new club had come in to sign him. He said: 'In July this year, there was a suggestion he had secured a contract with a football club, however, the club did not tell him when he should start playing football.' Alistair McKenzie, for Ranger, suggested the striker would pay a hefty fine, but is currently living off just £30-a-day from Newcastle under the terms of his release. His disposable income is £210 a week and he doesn't have access to any other savings for the purpose of these proceedings', he said. 'When he left Newcastle in March, payment was made and he receives £30-a-day living expenses. 'He doesn't have outgoings in that, all his outgoings like accommodation has already been dealt with as part of that contract.' Ranger follows former Manchester City star Carlos Tevez chose to be fined £3,000 for a driving conviction because he was making the move to Juventus in Italy . The striker was on £7,000-a-week at Newcastle, but much of it was paid into a savings account Ranger is not allowed to access until he is 25 because he had a long-standing gambling addiction. 'The money in an ISA is part of a previous financial arrangement, and the reason he can't get to the money is probably due to his gambling issues he had at the time', said Mr McKenzie. Ranger, a former England under-19 international, started his career in the Crystal Palace academy, before making the switch to Newcastle in July 2008. But he failed to make the grade on Teesside, managing just three goals in 62 appearances before being released. His career has also been dogged by controversy, including being forced into a grovelling apology after being pictured holding a gun in May 2011. Manager Alan Pardew repeatedly complained about Ranger's inability to turn up on time for training, resulting in a temporary banishment to the reserves. Ranger was fined £6,000 by The FA in March last year for making string of homophobic comments on Twitter, and he attracted criticism for posting a picture of his name spelled out in £20 notes earlier this year. Mr McKenzie said Ranger's agent, who sat at the back of court, is hopeful a club will sign the striker before the end of the summer transfer window, on a contract worth around £3,000-a-week. Magistrate Hazel Miall, chairing the hearing, accepted Ranger's bid for the sentence to be changed to a fine. She gave him 42 days to pay up, or come back to the court if he has failed to find a new club in that time. Ranger, of Bailey Close, Bounds Green, north London, admitted failing to comply with the requirements of a community order. He was fined £5,000, ordered to pay £80 costs and a £120 victim surcharge.

Late novellist Dame Barbara Cartland did - and even passed on the tip to fans, as newly discovered letters have revealed. 'I use Meltonian black shoe cream for my eyelashes,' wrote the author in a message to fan Sue Barker in 1959. The newly discovered beauty tips were part of a cache of letters collected from Barker's Cheshire home by her second cousin, Nada McArdle. Dame Barbara's famous jet black lashes came courtesy of 'shoe cream' according to her letters . Barker, who died 15 years ago, appeared to have been a big fan of Cartland's work and maintained a correspondence with the author until her death. Along with shoe polish as an alternative to mascara, Cartland also talked of her love of vitamins and health supplements including some that were 'not on the market yet.' Advising Barker on health supplements, Cartland wrote: 'The Natrovites should be sufficient to combat colds but you could also take Vitavel A capsules as well as the Redoxon Vitamin C, for your skin, and also Wheat Germ Oil, which you can obtain from the Organic Vitamin Company.' She added: 'I have not recommended anything that I have not tried personally and found to be good.' Dame Barbara also gave fans advice on what supplements to use - including some not on the market . Cartland was famous for her heavily made-up look and all-pink ensembles, and wrote 728 books - selling an estimated one billion copies in the process - prior to her death at the age of 97 in 2000. Although the majority of the works were romantic fiction, Cartland also penned a tome entitled Barbara Cartland's Book Of Beauty And Health, which contains such gems as 'you look as you think and feel, especially after 20'. So popular have Dame Barbara's tips proved, they've even inspired a blog - Leopards and Lillies - dedicated to sharing them. Her son, Ian McCorquodale, told the Times that his mother received up to 10,000 letters a year and replied to each one with the help of a secretary. 'She liked to use black shoe cream for her eyelashes,' he added. 'It gave a better black and lasted a lot longer.' On beauty: . 'If you give the other person your . complete attention when they are speaking to you, they will invariably . remember you as beautiful.' 'Keep your face above all, even before your body.' On skincare: . 'Citrus fruit juices and coffee are death to the complexion.''Put honey on your spots and by morning you will find that they have disappeared.' Use the yoke of an egg mixed with almond oil as a facemask. Allow to dry and wash off with rose water. Wash your face with cold water first thing in the morning.On keeping trim: .

Admission: Director General of the BBC Tony Hall said that staff knew about the doomed IT project but were to afraid to blow the whistle . The BBC’s director general admitted yesterday that his staff knew for years that a £100million IT project was failing but did nothing about it because of a culture at the corporation that prevents whistleblowers from coming forward. Lord Hall acknowledged a series of recent failures at the corporation, including the costly Digital Media Initiative (DMI) fiasco and the severance payoff scandal. Saying there was an ‘appalling divide’ between managers and staff, he admitted there was an ‘officer class’ at the top of the BBC and blamed a culture of ‘finger-pointing’ for preventing whistleblowers from raising the alarm when things went wrong. Lord Hall cancelled the DMI in May, saying it would be ‘throwing good money after bad’ to complete it. Launched in 2008, it was meant to digitise all BBC production but rapidly ran over budget and beyond deadlines. Speaking at the Edinburgh Television Festival he said: ‘What worries me most about DMI is the fact we went round the place and people said, “Yeah, we knew about that” but no one said. That’s the problem of a culture where fingers are pointed, blame is appointed – people don’t feel they can own up and say something is going wrong. ‘I don’t like that sort of culture. I want a culture where people can say, “We can take risks, we can do things which are creatively difficult, organisationally difficult, and we can learn from our mistakes.” ’ Making an unexpected appearance in Edinburgh, Lord Hall was also forced answer questions about the payoff scandal, following last month’s disclosure that the BBC handed departing staff £300million over eight years. The Digital Media Initiative (DMI) was meant to allow BBC staff to access everything in the archive from their computers, doing away with the need for video or audio tapes . One of his chief inquisitors was former BBC journalist Liz MacKean, who left the corporation after the Jimmy Savile scandal last year. She was one of two reporters to work on a Newsnight expose of the predatory DJ that was scrapped by news executives in 2010. Miss MacKean criticised the director general’s response to the crisis, saying: ‘The whole issue of severance payments gets to the heart of something that has been badly wrong with the BBC for decades, which is the creation of an officer class that seems to fly in the face of the principles of public service broadcasting. Gary Lineker  says he doesn’t deserve his £1.5million BBC pay deal. The England striker-turned-TV pundit said: ‘If you are at the top in entertainment you earn money that you can never justify to ordinary people doing proper jobs. ‘You can’t. I’m not even going to try. Do I deserve it? Probably not – but who would turn it down?’ Although Lineker has never publicly disclosed his Match of the Day salary, he is believed to have earned £2million before taking a £500,000 pay cut earlier this year. But the 52-year-old presenter – who also has lucrative contracts with Arabic network Al Jazeera and Walkers Crisps – insisted he would be able to rake in even more money if he worked for a different channel. ‘That is the downside of working for the BBC,’ he said. ‘I could earn more elsewhere, but because it’s the licence fee you are open to criticism.’ ‘The corporation has been treated as a get-rich scheme where the people at the top reward the outgoing people at the top even if they have got new jobs to go to, even if they have been given more than a year’s notice of their departure.’ Lord Hall admitted the debacle had been ‘terrible for morale’ within the BBC and agreed there had been an ‘officer class’ at the top of the corporation. He said he wanted to ‘heal this appalling divide’. Miss MacKean criticised the BBC’s leadership for failing to punish executives over the Savile scandal. ‘It doesn’t seem anyone has taken responsibility for it,’ she said. ‘How can people learn if mistakes aren’t admitted?’","DG Tony Hall acknowledgs failures over Digital Media Initiative fiasco .

Theresa May yesterday over-ruled her own drug advisers to ban a herbal stimulant linked to Islamist extremism. The Home Secretary said that, if she did not act, Britain could become a transit route for illegally shipping khat into mainland Europe. The amphetamine-like substance is already banned in most European countries, including France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and Ireland. Security experts have also warned that proceeds from selling the drug could be fuelling Islamist extremist groups, such as al-Shabab. Mrs May said that khat, which is popular among Somalis living in the UK, would become a Class C drug like anabolic steroids. The move will be controversial because it goes against the advice of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs. In January the ACMD said there was ‘insufficient evidence’ that khat caused health problems. The panel also found ‘no evidence’ that khat, made from leaves and shoots of a shrub cultivated in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, was directly linked with serious or organised crime. But, in a statement to MPs, Mrs May said the risks posed could have been underestimated. She said: ‘Failure to take decisive action and change the UK’s legislative position on khat would place the UK at a serious risk of becoming a single, regional hub for [its] illegal onward trafficking. ‘Seizures of khat transiting the UK en route to the Netherlands have already been increasing in size and frequency since the Dutch ban earlier this year.’ Khat is imported from Kenya, Ethiopia and Yemen. About 2,560 tonnes of khat were imported in 2011-12 with a value of £13.8m. It is usually chewed at social events in family homes, at community parties or at legal khat cafes. Users chew one or two bundles of khat for up to six hours at a time to produce a mild stimulant effect. Somali groups in the UK had told the ACMD that use of khat was a ‘significant social problem’ and said it caused medical issues and family breakdowns. The ACMD said withdrawal symptoms such as tiredness and depression were associated with khat. The . Home Office said the ban was intended to ‘protect vulnerable members of . our communities’ and would be brought in at the ‘earliest possible . opportunity’. Terror links: Bundles of khat on sale in Mogadishu, Somalia. Security experts have warned that proceeds from selling the drug could be fuelling Islamist extremist groups, such as al-Shabab . The decision risks sparking a new row between the government and the science world. Previous decisions to over-rule the ACMD on cannabis and Ecstasy drew a furious response which threatened to split the committee. Last week, Professor David Nutt, former head of the ACMD, said banning the substance would show ‘contempt for reason and evidence’. Last night, police suggested users would escape with a warning the first time they were caught. Chief Constable Andy Bliss, spokesman for the Association of Chief police officers, said: ‘As with other forms of drug misuse, the police response will be proportionate. ‘Activity is likely to be enhanced where there is also intelligence about associated crime or anti-social behaviour. ‘There may be a case for police action to follow similar lines to the approach used for cannabis possession offences, where a first offence by an adult generally attracts a warning and a second the issuing of a penalty notice before escalating to arrest and prosecution. ‘We will explore this possibility with the Home Office and with the College of Policing over forthcoming weeks.’","Amphetamine-like substance is already banned in most European .

Alexia Bates, 12, beat more than 30 finalists to add the Perfect Pageants title to her sixteen victories in the UK. Alexia has won every competition she entered since her first pageant 18 months ago when she was 10-and-a-half. Winner: Alexia Bates, 12, was crowned the World Pre-Teen Champion at the World Championships in Florida wearing this £20 dress from a rag market . She travelled to Orlando in Florida on August 3 with her mum April Bates, 39, after winning the European leg of the contest earlier this year. And while most girls wore outfits their parents had splashed out hundreds of pounds on Alexia proudly sported a pink princess dress purchased from an indoor market in Birmingham and decorated with jewels bought off eBay. And after impressing the judges, the rags-to-riches youngster was crowned the world's perfect pre-teen winning a trophy and $2,000 (£1282). Alexia's mother April, who lives with Alexia as well as her other daughter Raven, 17, and twin sons Jonah and Noah, five, in Dudley, West Mids., said: 'I'm very proud of her - she has only been competing for the last 18 months. Pageant princess: Alexia was automatically entered in to the World Championships after winning the European Championships in March of this year, at an event in Porthcawl, Wales . Talent: Alexia has won every single competition she entered since her first pageant 18 months ago when she was 10-and-a-half . Jet setting: She travelled to Orlando in Florida with her mother after winning Europe's perfect pre-teen earlier this year . 'Every one she has entered, she has won. She has got a good reputation in the UK and we travel all over the country for pageants. 'Everyone thinks it is all glamorous and expensive but it is what you make it. 'I'm not one who splashes out or wastes money. When it comes to Lexi's outfits, a lot of them are either bought off eBay or we create an outfit of our own. 'For the evening gowns, I will go to the rag market to get the dresses or material and Lexi will draw up what she wants. 'I've got a friend who used to be dress maker who makes them for me and I buy her some flowers to say thanks. 'For her evening gown for America I paid £20 for the dress and bought some diamantes for £25 from eBay.' Alexia impressed judges in rounds including summer wear and formal wear - as well as shining during the interview stage . Alexia at the Glitz Sparkle 2012 competition - one of the first American style beauty pageants to be held in the UK, which was hailed by children's charities as 'disturbing' While pageants have traditionally been a . purely American phenomenon, with competitions across the States . regularly filmed for downmarket reality shows such as Toddlers And . Tiaras, they are becoming increasingly common in Britain. The trend has attracted criticism from parenting groups and children's charities about the sexualisation of children. The director of children's charity . Kidscape, Claude Knights, warned recently: 'These children are so . young, it's impossible for them to be giving their consent to wearing . swimwear and pseudo-evening dresses, as well as fake eyelashes and spray . tans.' And Alexia took part in the controversial Miss Glitz Sparkle pageant, which saw children as young as 20 months participating. While organisers hailed the pageant as a great success, child welfare groups criticised it for encouraging the ‘over-sexualisation’ of young girls. Claude Knights, director of child protection charity Kidscape, described the pageants as a 'disturbing trend', adding: 'It’s impossible for some of these kids to be giving their consent to wearing swimwear and pseudo-evening dresses as well as fake eyelashes and spray tans.' But Alexia's mother insists that far from damaging her . daughter, entering the pageant has been a positive experience. There has been a lot of criticism regarding the pageant phenomenon with children's charities arguing that it sexualises children . And the teaching assistant said she disagrees with the negative publicity normally associated with the controversial competitions. She added: 'I think a lot of criticism comes from people who are only basing it from shows they see with the little girls. 'I agree with the little ones because I don't think it's right to put a two-year-old in fake tan or fake eyelashes. 'Lexi does wear make-up but it is age appropriate. She doesn't wear it normally or every day. Inspired: The contests have inspired Alexia to become a fashion designer . Confidence boost: Her mother says that Alexia has had a real confidence boost and made some great friends by entering the pageants . 'She will put a bit of lip gloss on if she is going out for a family meal or to the cinema but she doesn't cake it on. 'For the pageants obviously the make-up has to be a bit more because it's on a stage so it's the same as if it was in the theatre.

Bob Harper said that he once thought you could work everything you eat off, but that in reality it isn't that simple . Celebrity trainer Bob Harper, of the weight-loss TV show 'The Biggest Loser', has built a career putting very obese people through some gruelling fitness paces but if he's learned anything from the experience, it's that diet trumps exercise every time. The Los Angeles-based trainer, who was born on a cattle farm in Tennessee and arrived in California some 20 years ago, said gone are the days when he believed it was possible to just exercise the pounds away. 'It is all about your diet,' Harper, 48, said during a break from filming Season 15 of the long-running U.S. show. 'I used to think a long time ago that you can beat everything you eat out of you and it's just absolutely not the case.' Harper has spun his TV fame improving the fitness of people who are 100 pounds (45 kg) or more overweight into an empire with DVD workouts and the best-selling book ""The Skinny Rules,"" which offers tips to drop excess weight. He said if the ‘Skinny' of his book titles and fitness DVDs is meant tongue-in-cheek, it is also the word that his morbidly obese clients attach to most. 'People say, 'Shouldn't I be fit? Shouldn't I be healthy?', and I say ‘Yes, absolutely. But what I always hear from my contestants on the show is, 'I just want to get skinny.'' In addition to promoting a healthy diet, a big part of his exercise routine includes lunges and other core-strengthening moves to burn enough fat to let the inner six-pack shine through. Harper said the workout is aimed at getting the heart rate up because that's when people are going to be able to burn fat and when fat is burned off, the abdominal muscles are exposed. He also adheres to the no-frills strength and condition program called CrossFit, which is a series of timed, ever-changing physical challenges that he says are suitable for everyone. 'I'm working with people who are 500 pounds (227 kg) and doing CrossFit on a regular basis,' said Harper, who described the approximately 20-minute workout as well-balanced. Don't sweat it: Those who are keen to lose weight must address their eating habits if they really want to shift the pounds. Exercise is, however, still essential for fitness and wider health . 'To me CrossFit just completely makes sense (as long as) you work at your level doing the things you can do with proper coaching,' he explained. But Dr. Mark Kelly, an exercise physiologist at the American Council on Exercise, said that even with supervision, CrossFit can be risky if the fitness groundwork isn't in place. 'CrossFit has very ballistic training. You're asking people to move fast through a large range of motion. Even with coaching, the foundation of stability, mobility and psychomotor skill has to be laid (first),' he said. Kelly agrees that diet is the main factor that can lower weight, but it's exercise, he adds, that allows that lower weight to stick. He cited the National Weight Control Registry, a research study that includes people 18 years or older who have lost at least 13.6 kg (30 lb) of weight and kept it off for at least one year. Ninety percent of those in the study exercise regularly. 'They're the biggest losers across the nation,' Kelly said. 'And the No. 1 thing they did was exercise on a regular basis. Many simply through walking.'","Celebrity trainer Bob Harper, of the weight-loss TV show 'The Biggest Loser', has said that for significant weight loss, diet is key .

You may think you are doing your bit for the environment. But if you’re following the current trend of turning down the temperature on your washing machine to 30c, you could be doing yourself harm. New research has shown that potentially dangerous bacteria in our laundry are not killed off in low-temperature washes. They breed in the machine, and are passed on to future loads. Hygiene expert Dr Lisa Ackerley says: ‘Studies show that a build-up of bacteria in the interior of a washing machine transfers to the wash water of subsequent cycles — with as many as one million bacteria in just two tablespoons of water. ‘Low-temperature washing provides optimal conditions for germs to multiply.’ But manufacturers of washing machines and detergents are pestering us to lower temperatures to 30c, claiming it will save us money — and the planet. So, is the cool wash just another eco-con? Is it putting your health at risk? And what temperature should you be washing your clothes at? We investigate . . . WHY DOES HOT MEAN CLEAN? ‘Higher temperatures clean clothes more hygienically because when the water is hot, the cotton yarns swell up and forcibly release the soiling,’ says laundry expert Dr Richard Neale. As for the current craze for a cool wash, he is emphatic: 30c cycles simply won’t clean your clothes properly. ‘In fact, 30c is actually the temperature in which we incubate bugs to grow them for our experiments,’ he explains. ‘Oily skin sebum — the yellow mark you see on shirt collars and underarms — is a protein and breeds bugs that most detergents won’t kill at such cool temperatures. ‘In order to clean polyester cottons thoroughly, they need to be washed at a minimum of 65c for ten minutes. For pure cottons it is 71c for three minutes, which kills pretty well all viable micro-organisms. ‘If you’re doing a normal family wash and no one has any infectious diseases, this doesn’t really matter. Your family all share germs anyway, and it’s unlikely you’ll get ill. But if one of the household works in, say, healthcare or the catering industry, it’s vital their work clothes are thoroughly cleaned.’ Germs that are passed on through . minuscule spores — from the hospital superbug Clostridium difficile . (C.diff) and the food-poisoning bug Bacillus cereus, which is found in . products that have been left to sit around for too long, like rice, . right up to the lethal anthrax bacterium — have a good survival rate in . anything other than the hottest temperatures, says Dr Neale. In a spin: Will the eco-friendly cool cycle come out clean in the wash? ‘Only autoclaving (high-pressurised cleaning with steam) at 150c for about ten minutes will kill these, which is why anthrax is such a feared bioterrorist weapon,’ he adds. Meanwhile, Dr Ackerley points out the problem of cross-contamination if the wash-setting is not hot enough. ‘I am very concerned about bacteria from underwear transferring on to items such as tea towels which are then used to wipe dishes,’ she says. So, does this mean that no washing powder will kill these germs? ‘Some products do incorporate a chemical disinfectant which can reduce the amount of bugs in the wash,’ says Dr Neale, ‘but they are rarely available domestically. Ariel is among the very few brands that does one (Ariel Antibacterial+, £22.50, broschdirect.com). Otherwise you have to go to commercial laundry suppliers to get anything similar. If you have someone ill, elderly or with a low immune system at home, it might be wise to invest in an anti-bacterial detergent.’ If you’re not using an anti-bacterial detergent or a hot temperature, you are relying on simple dilution with water to disperse bugs, says Dr Neale. And this is ineffective. ‘With proper dilution, you can reduce the number of bugs from one million per square inch to around 10-20 per square inch, but in a normal washing process you don’t use nearly enough water. The only way to really kill germs is to wash at a higher temperature.’ JUST HOW MANY GERMS ARE IN YOUR MACHINE? While a 30c cycle won’t technically damage your washing machine, it can lead to a build-up of grease or black mould on your machine door or inside the detergent drawer. And some estimates say the average washing machine contains 100 million E.coli bugs at any one time. Dr Neale says: ‘Germs may be lurking in your machine if you only ever do cool washes. If you smell a rotting smell coming from your machine, you may want to think about doing a very hot wash — say, 90c — to sterilise it.’ Nature fresh? Biological washing powders are much better at killing germs in cooler washes . Consumer experts at Which? suggest doing at least one hot wash a month (60c minimum) and leaving the machine door ajar after every load to allow it, and the rubber seal around it, to dry out. Removing and cleaning the detergent drawer, and wiping around the rubber seal with light bleach cleaners will also reduce the ability of germs to breed. CAN YOU TRUST THE 60c SETTING? By now, you’re probably reaching for the 60c button on your washing machine. Indeed, studies show that washing at 30c or even 40c kills just six per cent of house-dust mites, compared with 100 per cent at 60c. But be warned: even the 60c setting may not kill germs properly. Why? Because some 60c settings simply don’t get that hot. Yesterday, Which? found that eight out of 12 popular washing machines failed to reach the correct temperature on a 60c wash. And none of the machines — which included Hoover, Miele, Hotpoint and Zanussi models — kept the water hot enough for long enough to kill bugs such as MRSA or the housemites that cause allergic reactions. In fact, one Hoover machine (the DYN8163D8P-80) only heated the water to 43c on its so-called 60c cycle. And most of the machines kept the water cooler than 50c for most of the wash programme. So you may have to go even higher than the 60° programme to make sure your wash is properly hot. WHICH DETERGENTS ARE BEST AT KILLING GERMS? While hot washes are undoubtedly better than cool ones, there’s one thing they’re not good at: cleaning delicate fabrics. Indeed, hot washes will destroy some fabrics such as silk, in which case an antibacterial additive needs to be put in the cooler wash. Dr Ackerley says: ‘Dettol Disinfectant Liquid claims to kill 99.9 per cent of bacteria at low-temperature washes. And there’s Napisan, a treatment powder for cloth nappies, which I use with other items of clothing, not just nappies.’ Other products that claim to sanitise clothes include Eradicil, Milton Antibacterial Fabric Solution and Halo. According to fabric technologist Mairwen Jones, biological powders work best at killing germs in  cooler washes. Out to dry: The Energy Saving Trust says 'economical' cool washes will save you a total of just £13 per year . ‘They contain enzymes not present in . non-biological detergents that break down stain particles, making them . easier to wash off. At temperatures above 60°, the enzymes are killed . off and the detergent is  less effective.’ Mairwen . says it’s a myth that  sensitive skins should avoid biological . detergents. ‘If your machine rinses clothes properly, all traces of . detergent should be removed, and they should be safe to wear against all . skin-types.’ IS A QUICK RINSE ANY USE? Many . modern machines have ‘quick wash’ cycles that clean clothes in as . little as 15 minutes, and the temperature never rises above 30c. Dr . Neale says: ‘A quick rinse is fine if the clothes are only very lightly . soiled with fresh perspiration. But this length of time and temperature . setting won’t swell the yarns of the cotton, so any significant soiling . will not be released.’ If you have a hot quick-wash cycle — 60c or above — it should kill most germs. So you can save time and be really clean. DOES WASHING AT 30c SAVE YOU MONEY? According to the Energy Saving Trust, the average washing machine is used for 274 cycles a year, using up to £63-worth of electricity, depending on the model. Machine and detergent manufacturers are keen to claim that consumers can use around 40 per cent less energy if they choose cool washes. But are the savings worth it? Andy Trigg, an engineer who runs consumer website whitegoodshelp.co.uk, doesn’t think so. ‘Using 41 per cent less electricity by washing at 30c sounds impressive but, as always with percentage figures, you need some perspective to judge how useful they are. For example, 2p is 100 per cent more than 1p, but 1p is hardly astounding.’ He cites an example on a detergent advert that states: ‘At 30c, the average energy consumed per wash was 0.284 KWh, while at people’s normal wash temperatures, this was 0.482 KWh.’ Andy says: ‘This means the saving in electricity by washing at 30c was on average 0.198 KWh. The average cost of electricity is 10p for using 1,000 watts in an hour (KWh). This means you will have saved just under half — 5p. The 41   per cent saving is only on this 5p, which works out at about 2p per wash.’ According to the Energy Saving Trust, the annual saving of cool washes is just £13 a year per household. Andy admits: ‘Any saving is good, and small savings add up. But it is not going to save a fortune.’ And it’s certainly not going to kill off germs, either.

An 101-year-old woman who lived through the Russian Revolution, Stalin's Great Purge and Hitler's 872-day seige of Leningrad, died Wednesday after being run over by a police squad car in St. Paul, Minnesota. Great-grandmother Roza Sakhina was fatally injured while walking across the middle of the street in front of her apartment in the Highland Park neighborhood of St Paul. The police officer driving the car was in the neighborhood responding to a juvenile disturbance call. Mrs Sakhina was crossing in the middle of the street in front of her apartment with the aid of a walker when the officer backed up and ran over her.   Police say he was not responding to another call at the time. Painful end: An 101-year-old Russian emigre who survived the atrocities of the revolution, Great Purge, and Siege of Leningrad died Wednesday after succumbing to injuries sustained after being run over by a police squad car . Neighbor Sue Chicone's apartment overlooked the intersection and witnessed the scene. 'Her head was gushing, gushing blood,' Chicone told the Star Tribune. An injured Mrs Sakhina tried to get up, but another elderly woman comforted her and tried to keep her relaxed. Mrs Sakhina was transported to Regions Hospital, but she never regained consciousness and died Wednesday from her injuries. So far, St. Paul police have yet to name the officer responsible for running over Mrs Sakhina, but previously said they would release that name Friday. St Paul police spokesman Paul Paulos said the officer involved was placed on a standard three-day paid adminsitrative leave and that the department is conducting a full investigation. Where it happened: Mrs Sakhina was crossing the street from the left when she was run over by the cop car . The Ramsey County medical examiner's office is not releasing the cause of death but according to Mrs Sakhina's grandon Ilya Finkelshteyn, she suffered a skull fracture, rib fracture, internal bleeding and 'quite a bit of bruising'. He declined to comment on the the role of the officer played in his grandmother's death. 'I'd prefer not to comment, except to say everyone in the family is stricken with grief.' Mrs Sakhina emigrated to St Paul from St Petersburg, Russia in 1991. In Russia, she worked as an accountant at a chocolate factory and hospital and was also a volunteer nurse. She passed her citizenship test in the late 1990s, without the aid of a translator. She made the move to the U.S. to join two of her grandchildren who had already previously emigrated. Finkelshteyn remembers his grandmother as a woman who was able to live an independent and active life even into old age. 'She lived on her own with very minimal help,' he said. She 'walked every day, cooked for herself, read lots.' 'She was very happy to be here, and she loved the state,' he said. Mrs Sakhina is survived by one son, three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. She is preceded in death by her husband who passed away in 1960 and one son.","Roza Sakhina died Wednesday from injuries sustained after being run over by a police squad car last Friday in St Paul, Minnesota .

A federal judge in Georgia has dismissed the lawsuit against celebrity chef Paula Deen and her brother after the pair was able to reach a settlement deal with the plaintiff in the case, who claimed she was the victim of workplace discrimination and harassment. Lisa Jackson sued Deen and her brother, Bubba Hiers, last year saying she was subjected to sexual harassment and racist attitudes during the five years she worked at their restaurant, Uncle Bubba's Seafood and Oyster House. Earlier this month, the same judge tossed . out race discrimination claims by a former Savannah restaurant manager . whose lawsuit against Deen ended up causing her to . lose nearly all of her culinary empire. Groveling: Paula Deen begs the public to forgive her on NBC's Today after revelations stemming from former employee Lisa Jackson's charges of racial discrimination effectively ended the TV chef's career . But U.S. District Court Judge William . T. Moore Jr. ruled Monday that Jackson, who is white, has no standing . to sue them for race discrimination. ‘The Court concludes that Plaintiff is not an aggrieved party under Title VII because her interests are not those arguably sought to be protected by that statue,’ wrote Moore. ‘At best, Plaintiff is an accidental victim of the alleged racial discrimination.  There are no allegations that Defendant Hiers's racially offensive comments were either directed toward Plaintiff or made with the intent to harass her.’ WTOC in Savannah is reporting that the details of the settlement are yet to be disclosed, but that Deen, Hiers and Jackson each have signed off on the agreement. According to TMZ, Jackson tried claiming that she has a biracial person in her family and was thus a victim of Deen's racist remarks. The ruling leaves intact Jackson's sexual harassment claims stemming from her five years as an employee of Uncle Bubba’s and The Lady and Sons in Savannah. Jackson claims Hiers’ and Deen’s conduct—including violent acts, discrimination and racism—led to the end of her employment.Deen responded to the news that the race discrimination claims were tossed through her lawyers after the judges ruling. Family affair: Jackson worked for Deen and her brother Bubba Hiers at their Savannah restaurants. She is suing them both, but it is Deen who has taken the hit. Ironically, a judge threw out the race discrimination charges Monday . ‘We are pleased with the Court's ruling today that Lisa Jackson's claims of race discrimination have been dismissed,’ Deen's representatives told CNN. ‘As Ms. Deen has stated before, she is confident that those who truly know how she lives her life know that she believes in equal opportunity, kindness and fairness for everyone.’ Meanwhile, Deen has lost a slew of major endorsement, book, and television deals since admitting in a deposition to using racist language. Unemployed: Jackson says she lost her job due to Deen and Hiers' conduct. Now Deen is the one out of a job as all her many lucrative endorsement deals have fled the embattled TV chef . The embattled TV chef even lost the gig that made her famous as the Food Network chose not to renew Deen’s contract after 11 years with the cable network. Deen lent her culinary talents to three separate shows. Deen’s 15th cookbook initially shot to the top of Amazon’s pre-order list, but was subsequently cancelled by publisher Ballantine Books.

Germans were banned from eating sausages to help with the First World War effort, researchers have said. Zeppelin airships were a key weapon for the Central Powers during the 1914 to 1918 war but production placed a huge demand on cow guts, used to make gas holding cells. It took more than 250,000 cows to make a single airship and the animals’ intestines became so precious that making the popular bratwurst and other sausages was temporarily made illegal in areas under German control. Fear the wurst: Germans were banned from eating sausages during World War I because the Central Powers needed cows to help them produce Zeppelins to launch raids on Britain . Gunned down: A Zeppelin Z 48 comes down in East Anglia in 1917. Initially they were difficult to bring down because a few bullet holes did not cause much air to leak out of the aircraft which hold thousands of gallons of air. However, an incendiary bullet was later developed which set the Zeppelins alight . Details of the sausage ban were uncovered by researchers working on a Channel 4 documentary in a document prepared for the US . National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics in 1922. The . ban also applied to occupied Austria, Poland and Northern France. It read: 'The collection of the goldbeater’s skins was very systematic in Germany during the war. 'Each butcher was required to deliver the ones from the animals he killed. 'Agents exercised strict control in Austria, Poland and Northern France, where it was forbidden to make sausages.' For the programme Dr Hugh Hunt, a University of Cambridge engineer, examined the role of the Zeppelin in the war, which foreshadowed the Blitz by bringing war to British civilians for the first time in centuries. Wreckage: An L33 Zeppelin is shot down by British fighter aircraft in 1916. By 1917, 77 of the 115 German airships had been destroyed . Morale sapping: A Zeppelin raid on England during World War I destroyed this house in Maldon, Essex . He studied how the silent aircraft were built and how the British adapted to their threat. 'One of the most intriguing things about the Zeppelins is that we don’t have a huge amount of information about how they were built, nor about how they were destroyed,' he said. 'But while shooting down a massive hydrogen balloon sounds pretty easy, actually it was quite the opposite. 'For the best part of two years, these things were able to fly over Britain, dropping bombs and causing havoc.' Records have long suggested that the Germans used cow intestines to contain the hydrogen needed to make them fly but it had never been clear how this was achieved. Destroyed: Two workmen inspect the wreckage after a Zeppelin damaged a house in England during World War I . Battlefield: German prisoners helping to carry wounded British soldiers back to their trenches after an attack near Ginchy during the Battle of the Somme in 1916 . Sausage ban: The Wurst was banned by the Central Powers in Germany, Austria, Poland and Northern France . Dr Hunt and his colleagues visited a sausage factory in Middlesbrough where they worked out that by making sausage skins wet, stretching them and allowing them to dry again, they could be bonded together to form ideal vessels for gas. Conceived as a way to break British civilian morale, the Zeppelin raids never caused enough casualties to alter the course of the war. But for civilians who witnessed them, the attacks, which began in January 1915, were a shocking experience. London’s East End and other towns in east and southern England, including Hull, King’s Lynn and Great Yarmouth, were targeted. Because of their stealth, the attacks were difficult to counter and when the raids ended in 1917, 77 of the 115 German airships had been shot down but 1,500 British citizens had been killed. Dr Hunt said: 'If you shoot a bullet at a balloon of hydrogen, all you get is a small hole. 'There were 50 thousand cubic metres of gas in a Zeppelin, and by putting a few holes in it, all you were doing was depriving it of a few cubic metres. It barely made any difference.' Eventually an incendiary bullet which set the Zeppelins alight was developed. It was not until he began filming the show that Dr Hunt discovered the bullets’ designer was his own great uncle, Jim Buckingham. Attack Of The Zeppelins will be shown on Channel 4 on Monday.

A popular Pennsylvania math teacher won't be retuning for the new school year after he went missing last month during a backpacking trip in California. Nazareth Area High School teacher Matthew Greene, 39, disappeared while backpacking through the Eastern Sierra Mountains on July 16. Greene arrived in the area on June 27 to climb with friends, but when his Suburau broke down they continued on while he stayed behind at a campground near Mammoth Lakes to wait for repairs. Lost: Pennsylvania math teacher Matthew Greene went missing while hiking with friends through the Eastern Sierra mountains in California last month . On his own: Greene was a math teacher at Nazareth Area High School. When his car broke down near Mammoth Lakes, he had the rest of the group continue on without him so he could get it repaired . The last time he had contact with anyone was on July 16 when he called his parents and the car repair shop and exchanged text messages with friends. His friends realized he was missing when he failed to meet up with them as planned. They then discovered that his car had been repaired but he never picked it up and he hadn't returned to the Shady Rest Campground for over a week. Friends and family say that Greene was 'no novice' when it came to outdoor skills and made the trip west every summer to climb in California, Nevada and Utah. Off the grid: The lat time anyone heard from Greene was on July 16 when he called his parents, the car repair shop and exchanged text messages with a friend. Above, an older picture of Greene and his car . Where did he go? Friends realized he was missing when he failed to rendezvous according to plan and his fixed car was never picked up from the repair shop. He also hadn't been seen at the Shady Rest Campground for over a week . No novice: Friends and family find Greene's disappearance suspicious since he was a skilled outdoorsman and spent most summers hiking out west . 'Nothing like this has ever happened before,' Greene's mother Patricia Greene told The Union Democrat. 'He was in Papua New Guinea for three years (while serving in the Peace Corps) and survived with no modern conveniences, so he's got survival skills. He's hiked in Ireland, ran in the Boston Marathon - he just does it all.' The search for Greene is being led by the Mammoth Lake Police Department. At Greene's camp site they found some of his gear missing and a guide book with pages torn out of it. Friends say he tended to tear out the pages for hikes he wanted to go on, and when he completed them he would but them back in his book. The pages he tore out refer to the Minerat area, a five by 20 mile area which includes Mt Ritter and Mt Banner but Greene didn't sign his name on either summit's log. Paper trail: Torn out pages of a guide book were found at Greene's abandoned camp site leading friends to believe he may have gone out for a hike in the Minerat area . What to look for: Friends created a Facebook page to help locate Greene. They posted a picture of the tent he would be using . Traces: Friends posted a picture of glasses found by a hiker yesterday that seem quite similar to Greene's own pair . Friends of Greene have aided in the search, flying out to California to canvas bus drivers, store owners, librarians and others in the Mammoth Lakes area. They have posted fliers at trail heads and checked other summit registers, tracking through the back country for clues. They've taken to the sky, trying to spot Greene from a helicopter and one of Greene's friends shot high-resolution video from a private plane. Volunteers from the California search-and-rescue have even chipped into the search effort. Now, Greene's sister Tiffany Minto is considering hiring a private investigator 'just to exhaust every possible avenue'. Minto at first suspected that her brother might have been in an accident but now she thinks he could have been the victim of foul play. Police say Greene may have tried hitch-hiking to a remote area to hike or climb. As the days wear on and Greene continues to remain missing in the wilderness, his family are optimistic but preparing themselves for the worst. 'We kind of have realistic expectations,' Minto said. 'We may never get answers as to the how and the what. But we will settle for anything we can just get to bring him home and get some closure on it.","High school math teacher Matthew Greene, 39, was backpacking through the Eastern Sierra Mountains with friends .

Bill Clinton's journey to the White House was said to have been fuelled by a diet consisting of meat, french fries, sugar and little else. One insider recalls how the 6ft 2ins Clinton could wolf down six pork chops a day and was known to gobble half a strawberry cake in a single sitting. Bill Clinton's poor diet is the stuff of legend, but one cunning White House chef has told how he put him on secret diet by creating low-fat alternatives of favourite dishes . Another story tells of an aide having to step in after he bought a dozen doughnuts during a campaign stop in New Hampshire to prevent him polishing off the lot. Now one cunning former White House chef has revealed how he was able to fool the president by secretly slipping low-fat ingredients into his favourite dishes. Marty Mongiello was so concerned he might be contributing to the early death of a president that he began experimenting 'like a mad scientist' with healthy alternatives. Junk food fan: President Clinton and first lady Hillary enjoy hotdogs at the New York State Fair in 2000 . Meat the president: Clinton prepares to carve a turkey on Thanksgiving in Camp David in 2000 . He began using pureed rice mixed with . milk as a substitute for cream, soy paste instead of beef stock, tofu . instead of cheese and splenda instead of sugar. INGREDIENTS: . Method: . In 1993, first lady Hillary Clinton, . became so concerned about her husband's penchant for junk food, . that she brought in diet guru Dr. Dean Ornish to work with the White . House chefs who were used to preparing calorie-laden French cuisine. Together they created a healthy menu with dishes like stir fry vegetables with tofu, and salmon with vegetables. Once after preparing a naughty-looking fettuccine Alfredo starter for the Clintons at Camp David, Mr Mongiello was summoned to the table by concerned Hilary. In an interview with the Washington Post, Mr Mongiello recalls a waiter telling him: 'She wants to see you out there. Dude, you’re gonna get fired.' 'She said, ""Look, there’s cream, there’s cheese — these things are illegal."" And I just explained how I made it.” 'Her reaction was: ""Wow, I can’t believe it. We thought those were a thing of the past."" 'She wasn’t mad or anything, she was just really concerned about her husband’s health.' Another dish that fooled Mr Clinton was a tofu cheesecake which used egg-whites and low-calorie cream cheese. Despite the low fat regime Mr Clinton  struggled with his weight during his two terms as president. At his annual physical in 1999, his physician noted the president had gained 18 pounds in two years. When he left office his eating habits went downhill and in 2004 he had a quadruple heart bypass and was forced to adjust his diet once again. Then in 2010 after doctors implanted two stents to open one of the veins from that surgery he adopted a vegan diet and ha since lost a reported 24lbs.","Food-loving Clinton was known to gobble up to six pork chops a day .

A hero police dog has been posthumously given a bravery award after he saved his handler's life - by jumping into the path of a bullet. German Shepherd Gage was killed during a routine drugs search with Senior Constable Bruce Lamb on July 13, 2010. The duo were called to assist colleagues at a house in Christchurch, in New Zealand and told to arrest a suspect, Christopher Smith, 34, who was hiding in a bedroom. Gage died during a routine drugs seizure when a wanted man fired at him and his handler, Officer Bruce Lamb suffered a shot to the face which shattered his jaw into 15 places . But as Senior Constable Lamb entered the room with the five-year-old dog, he was shot in the face by a rifle - shattering his jaw and sending him crashing to the floor. The officer looked up to see the gun being pointed directly at him but remarkably his faithful companion Gage leapt across his body and took the second bullet. Despite his serious injuries, Senior Constable Lamb managed to escape from the room with Gage while the gunman Smith continued to shoot at other officers. Once outside the room, police realised the bullet had hit and killed their faithful dog who was lying motionless in the street. Senior Constable Lamb was rushed to hospital for emergency medical treatment and Smith was arrested shortly afterwards. He was sentenced to 14 years in jail on July 24, 2010 for crimes including attempted murder and the killing a police dog. Last night (Wed), heroic Gage received the animal equivalent of the George Cross from from UK veterinary charity PDSA at a moving ceremony in New Zealand. The PDSA Gold Medal is only given to animals that are instrumental in saving human or animal life when its own life is in jeopardy or through outstanding devotion to duty. Hero: Gage the German Shepherd who died after jumping in front of a bullet pictured here with the beloved handler Bruce Lamb, who he was trying to protect . Speaking the presentation in Christchurch, Senior Constable Lamb said: 'Gage was a strong and unique dog, and had been by my side constantly since joining the police. 'The thing I regret most about that day, even though it was outside of my control due to my injuries, was having to leave him on his own after he had laid down his life for me. 'The presentation is not just recognising Gage's sacrifice, it's also about honouring his life and courage. I'll forever be indebted to him.' PDSA's Director General, Jan McLoughlin, added: 'When I first heard about what happened in Christchurch it struck me that, as the horrifying events unfolded, Gage must have been just as terrified as his human colleagues. 'Despite it ultimately costing his life, Gage continued to perform his duty and protected his handler, an act of bravery that epitomises the unique bond between man and dog, which should never be underestimated. 'The PDSA Gold Medal is only awarded for the most extreme acts of courage and dedication. Gold standard: Gage now joins an exclusive list of just list of 22 other animal heroes who have previously been awarded the PDSA Gold Medal . 'Gage's actions and sacrifice on that day undoubtedly saved the life of Senior Constable Lamb. He is an exceptionally worthy recipient.' Recalling the fateful day, Senior Constable Lamb described the moment he realised Gage had saved his life. He said: 'I shouted out 'police', and carefully pushed open the bedroom door. Gage, as always, was close by my side, alert and ready for action. 'The room was in darkness, but as I entered I could see the shadow of a person just in front of me. All of a sudden I saw a flash and a bullet hit me in the face. 'I was about to be shot again, and probably killed, when Gage suddenly leapt into action. 'I felt him jump and launch himself over me. As I felt his paws pushing on my back, a second shot was fired. 'I looked down to find Gage lying motionless in the middle of the street. 'At that moment I realised that the bullet fired, intended for me, had in fact hit and killed my faithful companion.' Senior Constable Bruce Lamb's jaw bone was shattered into 15 pieces by the first bullet that struck him. The brave officer has since returned to front-line policing with his a new police dog, a black Labrador named Mylo. Gage's name now joins a list of 22 other animal heroes who have previously been awarded the PDSA Gold Medal. Other recipients include UK police explosives search dogs Vinnie, Jake and Billy for their lifesaving work in the aftermath of the July 7 terrorist bombings in London in 2005. Most recently, Spanish civil guard dog, Ajax, was honoured in June 2013 for his work detecting an ETA bomb during a terrorist campaign on the island of Majorca.","Senior Constable Bruce Lamb was shot in the face by the wanted man .

Football fanatic: Rhys Jones, 11, who was shot dead . aged 11 after being caught up in gang violence as he walked home from . football practice in 2007 . The football team of murdered Rhys Jones has been forced to disband after opponents threatened to shoot his old team mates. Steve Geoghegan, coach of Fir Tree FC in Liverpool, stepped down as manager of the team after becoming disgusted with on-pitch aggression and violence. Mr Geoghegan, 54, who is a close friend of Rhys's parents Stephen and Melanie Jones, revealed his horror after an opponent threatened to shoot his players during a match. Mr Jones, 49, described the comments on the pitch as 'appalling' and has supported the coach's decision to step down from his role. Mr Geoghegan, a social care worker, told The Sun: 'All the current kids are coming up to 18 now and as they get older the arguments on the pitch get worse. I'm not doing it any longer.' Eleven-year-old Rhys was shot dead by gang member Sean Mercer as he walked back from football practice across the car park of Croxteth's Fir Tree pub in August 2007. Mercer, then 16, was firing at rival gang members when a bullet ricochet off a wall and struck Rhys. Since the killing, Fir Tree FC have travelled across Europe to spread an anti-violence message, urging youngsters to 'join a team, not a gang'. But Mr Geoghan says that despite their efforts problems have remained. In one terrifying episode that occurred after a row over a tackle one team threatened to come back and shoot his players, he said. 'They were about 14 or 15 and they ran across the pitch and hurled a volley of abuse at the parents and threatened to come back and shoot them,' he said. 'It wasn't taken lightly, given what happened to Rhys.' 'Appalling': Rhys's parents Melanie and Stephen . Jones outside court after Sean Mercer was convicted of their son's . murder. Mr Jones said he felt players were copying the violent behaviour . from top-level football . Rhys's father, Mr Jones, added: 'It's such a shame that this is still going on and it's incredibly dangerous behaviour. 'Mainly because these youngsters can get out of control and end up carrying out the threats because of some sense of bravado - that's when it ruins lives. 'Steve's the man that's been running the teams and he's had to deal with some shocking and appalling threats and actual violence on the pitch. 'He's the man that was taking the brunt of it so it's ultimately his decision. They'll still be running an under-eights side but sadly these things come to an end. 'A lot of it stems from top level football and sadly we see it at these levels and it has forced our son's old club to close down.' Rhys was shot dead by Sean Mercer as he walked the car park of Croxteth's Fir Tree pub in August 2007. Mercer, then 16, was firing at rival gang members when a bullet ricocheted off a wall and struck Rhys . Mercer was convicted of Rhys's murder in 2009, when he was 18, and sentenced life with a minimum term of 22 years before he could even be considered for parole. He had been trying to shoot rivals from the Strand Gang who had strayed onto his turf. Rhys was shot with a First World War Smith and Wesson revolver, and a gang-member was caught trying to buy a replacement weapon just weeks later. Four other gang members were jailed for helping Mercer try to cover up his involvement in the shooting. And Mercer's mother Janette received a three-year jail sentence for denying all knowledge of the distinctive mountain bike her teenage son was riding when he shot Rhys.","Fir Tree FC coach steps down disgusted with aggressive behaviour on pitch .

Order!' in the Commons chamber. But Speaker John Bercow showed he has the remarkable ability to impersonate the parliamentary style of the Tory MPs he keeps in check. Mr Bercow's impressions, performed while he was giving a talk to German students, may do little to endear him to the Conservative Party. However, his mimicry of Education Secretary Michael Gove, Father of the House Sir Peter Tapsell and Jacob Rees-Mogg was clearly in jest. Scroll down for video . Wordplay: Commons speaker John Bercow was recorded doing impressions of Tory MPs during a speech in Germany . After viewing the footage, Mr Gove admitted: 'John has got me to a tee'. The mini 'speeches' that Mr Bercow gave to the students at the Hertie School of Government . in Berlin were strikingly similar to genuine statements the MPs had made . in Parliament - with one of the examples dating back to 1998. In his assessment of Mr Gove, the Speaker said he was an 'extremely capable performer in Parliament' who can sometimes thought of as patronising. 'Michael will sort of lavish the person with superficial praise', he explained, adding that Mr Gove has 'a capacity for referring to other members in terms that are elaborate and nominally polite, but which if reflected upon seem to be pretty damming.' Secretary of state Michael Gove was described by Mr Bercow as 'an extremely capable performer' Giving an impression of Mr Gove in action Mr Bercow began: 'Well that's a typically acute observation by the honourable gentleman, well I congratulate the honourable gentleman, he's certainly brought to my notice a matter of considerable importance.' Mr Bercow added that the matter in question would normally have been 'as banal a matter as can possibly have been raised at any time that afternoon.' And Mr Gove himself appeared to be impressed telling the Guardian: 'I'm afraid John has absolutely got me to a tee. He's a very good mimic - and a very good speaker.' Mr Bercow then turned his attention to Jacob Rees-Mogg who he described as being 'well-liked', but regarded by the Labour party as 'a curious figure who has sort of wandered into the house from another century'. Mr Rees-Mogg is in Mr Bercow's view an 'extraordinary character', but one who could be regarded as something of a 'young fogey'. 'He dresses in a very old fashioned way,'Mr Bercow explained. 'Often with a waist coat and he's always got his hankerchief in the right place. 'He's got a habit of getting up and asking questions in a manner that would have been done 50-year-ago.' A typical Jacob Rees-Mogg question was in the Speaker's opnion: 'Is my right hon friend aware that it invariably falls to this great party of ours to rescue the country from the ravages of debt and despair, which it's been the historic failing of the socialists?' That indeed bore an undeniable similarity to a question asked by Mr Rees-Mogg in March 2011. Sir Peter Tapsell, the oldest MP in the Commons, was last to receive the Bercow treatment. 'Sir Peter's manner, you talk about old fogey's or codgers, I wouldn't dream of making such a disobliging comment ,' the speaker said. Ripe for the picking: Tory MP's  Jacob Rees-Mogg and Sir Peter Tapsell also received the Bercow treatment . His example of a typical question by . the 83-year-old MP for Hove was: 'Is my honourable friend aware that in . 1955 when I served as personal assistant to Sir Anthony Eden, he advised . me then that ad hominem attacks upon the character of one's opponents . was invaraiably conter productive.'

Britain is undergoing a 'brain drain' as skilled workers leave the country for a better life abroad, it has today been claimed. But thanks to the continued immigration into the country from overseas, Britain is still getting bigger rather than smaller. Figures released by the Office for National Statistics reveal the number of British citizens who have moved abroad was 154,000 last year. Figures reveal 1.3million University educated Britons are living overseas, which is more than any other developed economy . The figure has risen by a fifth under the Coalition, the Telegraph reports. And statistics from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reveal that 1.3million University educated Britons are living overseas, which is more than any other developed economy. Germany has 865,000 highly-skilled citizens living abroad, whereas the U.S. has almost 400,000. Nick de Bois, secretary of the 1922 committee of backbench MPs, told the paper that more needed to be done to 'sell' Britain to the talented professionals that live here in a bid to keep them. He said: 'We have to convince those people, who we have invested so much in, to make Britain their first choice. We have to continue to drive lower taxes, we have to keep driving the change and reform in our public services.' He said that many of those leaving Britain are emigrating to work in Hong Kong and countries in the Middle East, where they will have a better standard of living and education for their children. They tend to go to  aerospace, engineering and creative companies, he said. More than 100,000 additional citizens chose to live abroad last year - almost equivalent to the number of foreigners choosing to leave the country. Nick de Bois, secretary of the 1922 committee of backbench MPs, told the paper that more needed to be done to 'sell' Britain to the talented professionals that live here in a bid to keep them . But the population is still growing. Since 1992 the UK population has risen by 6.1million, a rise of 11 per cent . Recent figures show the increase in the number of people living in the UK was higher than any other country in the European Union . Mr de Bois said that it means we are losing the professional, skilled class, but that lower taxes and a change of culture could help persuade them to stay. It comes as concern mounts over the number of British graduates . from the country's best universities who are choosing to work abroad. One-in-10 graduates from Cambridge, . Durham, Exeter and Oxford 2011 are now working overseas. The figure is 12 per cent among British students from St Andrews. Earlier this month, it was revealed that the population in Britain rose by almost 420,000 in a year, driven by the highest birth rate since 1972. The figure, which covers the 12 months to the middle of 2012 is more than the population increases in Germany, Belgium, Holland and Sweden combined. The Office for National Statistics says around four in ten of the additional people are immigrants. Six out of ten are the result of rising birth rates, which brought a 40-year high in the number of babies born last year – 254,400 more births than deaths.","Last year 154,000 British citizens moved abroad for a better life .

The mother-of-two who danced under the name 'Geordie Jordan' had nine bags of cocaine in her handbag when police raided her home . A lap dancing club manageress who helped to supply customers with cocaine has been jailed for two years and six months. House madam Cheryl 'Dolce' Byron, 45 supplied undercover police officers with bags of cocaine at £45 or £50 each during visits to the club Red Velvet, which has since closed. According to the Northern Echo, two dancers also helped to 'sort' the officers, ‘Warren’ and ‘Paul’ with bags of the class A drug. Shaun Dryden, prosecuting, said the four-month undercover operation culminated in the Consett premises being raided by police on December 14 last year, after two bags of cocaine were supplied to the officers, and a further nine were found in Byron’s handbag. Police then recovered 326mg of amphetamines from her home in Lemington, Newcastle. It resulted in the designated door supervisor and two dancers receiving cautions, but Byron was charged with supplying and possessing cocaine, and possession of the class B drug amphetamine. But her admissions were made on the basis she did not supply anyone other than the two undercover officers, and that was only because she 'took a shine' to ‘Warren’. Byron admitted she was a cocaine addict and took the drug with drink every night at work, but would not supply it to the dancers or to other customers. She claimed she only supplied ‘Warren’ as she took a fancy to him, and it was not for profit. But Recorder Amanda Rippon ruled that Byron was supplying cocaine beyond the two undercover officers. Plainly, she was a supplier to people in general and not just to the undercover officers. She was also giving the drugs to the dancers.' The 45-year-old worked as the house madam at Red Velvet in Consett, Co Durham. She supplied the two officers with cocaine with the help of two dancers . Recorder Rippon said there was 'a commercial enterprise', albeit with, 'a lack of sophistication. 'It appears to have been a relatively small-scale operation, but a commercial one, at that.' According to the Northern Echo, Ms Byron's barrister, Gavin Goig, said that since the raid the mother-of-two has stopped taking cocaine and has curbed her previous heavy drinking. Mr Doig said as a result she has been better able to help care for her mother, who suffers alzheimer’s disease. He said Byron, the mother of two now grown-up children, has no . previous convictions, having not come to police attention previously, . despite her addiction.","Cheryl Byron was found to have 325mg amphetamines in her home .

Nearly half of cancer patients believe they will die of the disease despite advances in treatment, a poll reveals. More than two in five Britons say a cancer diagnosis is a ‘death sentence’ – double the proportion of those surveyed in the US. In reality, 56 per cent of women and 46 per cent of men are still alive five years after being diagnosed. Survival rates for different types of the disease range from 8 per cent for lung cancer to 85 per cent for breast cancer and 98 per cent for testicular cancer. These figures have improved dramatically since the 1970s, up between 33 per cent and 50 per cent for some common types. Patients and carers here are also pessimistic about other aspects  of cancer care, with three-quarters saying it takes too long for new medicines to be available. A report last year by the Office for Health Economics showed on average it takes two-and-a-half years for the NHS ‘rationing’ body to decide whether the Health Service should fund a new drug. The survey, conducted in six countries, found almost half of those questioned in the UK believe not enough is being spent on cancer research. More than two thirds said ‘current challenges’ facing the UK economy could stifle innovative work on the disease in future. The study, by cancer care campaign Lilly PACE in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US involved 4,000 cancer patients, carers and members of the general population, including 700 Britons. Results showed that three out of four Britons are satisfied with recent progress in fighting cancer, but 42 per cent still feel a diagnosis is a death sentence – compared to only 21 per cent of Americans. Steve Hindle, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘It’s important that we bust this myth … Thanks to advances in the way we diagnose and treat cancer, more people than ever are surviving their illness.’","Twice as many British than US cancer patients believe they will die .

A cage fighter beat his wife so badly after she sent him a text message saying their relationship was over that police thought they had been called to a murder scene. Mother-of-two Charlotte Small, 33, was so scared that Gary Marcel, 46, would attack her that she had already entered 999 into her phone - but he immediately snatched it off her. The thug forced his way into Miss Small's home and repeatedly kicked and punched her in the face - shouting 'no one will want you now'. Horror attack: Mother-of-two Charlotte Small, 33, (left) after she had been repeatedly beaten by thug Gary Marcel, 46, (right) who has been jailed for 11 years . Marcel stamped on her breasts, pulled out clumps of her hair, fractured her eye socket and almost ripped off her ear during the attack in Maidstone, Kent. Miss Small, who still suffers from memory loss, said today that her husband, who she has since divorced, took breaks during the attack before continuing to beat her. She was finally rescued after her neighbour Martin Nolan, 75, heard her piercing screams and called Kent Police. Marcel, who was found standing over the apparently lifeless, half-naked body of his wife with his hands drenched in blood, told officers 'it was me'. One officer who was called to the scene three days before Christmas last year described Miss Small’s facial injuries as 'the most disturbing I have seen in my 10 years service'. Miss Small, who is mother to Finn, six, and Molly, eight, said: 'He said he’d come to kill me. Recovery: Charlotte Small who was left with injuries so severe after the attack that police thought they had been called to a murder scene . 'He was kicking me in the face and said ""no one will want to be with you now"". I ran around the house, desperately looking for corners to hide in. 'At times he stopped hitting me and stroked my hair saying he needed a rest.' Recounting previous episodes of violence, Miss Small said: 'He pulled radiators off the wall, punched holes in every door and one night he ripped kitchen units out.' In the summer of 2012 Marcel attacked the mother in front of her children for the first time. She said: 'It was terrible, Finn hid under a bed and Molly was trying to pull Gary off me.' Marcel, of Snodland, Kent, denied attempted murder and his guilty plea to causing grievous bodily harm with intent was accepted by the prosecution. Judge Michael Carroll sentenced Marcel to 11 years behind bars at Maidstone Crown Court. Sentencing Marcel, Judge Carroll told him: 'You caused horrific and life-changing injuries to this young woman.' The court also heard how the former soldier had been cautioned in February 2012 for assaulting her. After another savage beating in August last year, Marcel was given a suspended prison sentence for assault and harassment. He was slapped with a restraining order until 2017, but that didn’t stop the monster from tracking Miss Small down. Marcel breached the order in the attack on December 22.","Gary Marcel shouted 'no one will want you now' as he attacked his partner .

A taxpayer-funded body has sparked anger among Tories by spending £1 million on a film based on the antics of the Bullingdon Club, the notorious Oxford University society that counted David Cameron and Boris Johnson as members. The British Film Institute is using the Lottery money to help fund a film adaptation of the West End hit Posh. It follows the drunken exploits of The Riot Club, who cause havoc after descending on a pub for one of their dinners. Big screen: Former Bullingdon club members David Cameron (left) and Boris Johnson (right) will be portrayed in the BFI-funded film . Members are portrayed as upper-class yobs who sneak a prostitute into the venue before wrecking the pub and assaulting the landlord. In one scene, a former member of The Riot Club – now a Tory MP – explains how he has managed to limit the fallout resulting from their behaviour. The film, due to be released next year, will feature Jeremy Irons’s son Max, Douglas Booth and Natalie Dormer, the star of Game Of Thrones. Last night Tory MP Lee Scott said: ‘I have to question the timing and motive in awarding Lottery money for what looks like a politically biased film to be released on the eve of the next General Election.’ Drunken antics: TV show When Boris Met Dave (pictured) and West End Hit Posh have exposed the Oxford students' scandalous behaviour . Complaints: Tory MPs have criticised the film about the notorious society for being politically-motivated.

According to the modern man, the height of romance is giving their partner control of the TV remote. The answer appears in the top ten romantic gestures as voted by  2000 British men and women in a recent survey. After sacrificing the remote control, the other top choices from the men included . offering to clean the house (11 per cent), putting the bins out (seven . per cent) and leaving the toilet seat down (seven per cent). I love you this much: British men said they thought it was romantic to relinquish control of the TV remote . Washing the dishes and doing the ironing was also rated as a 'romantic' thing to do. However, it seems not all men are oblivious of how to keep romance alive as 37 per cent voted for surprising their partner with bouquet of flowers while 31 per cent opted for offering to cook the dinner. Both of these answers were the women's top choices for a romantic gesture followed by being run a hot bath. Managing director Iain Martin, from Moonpig, who commissioned the research, said: 'A nice bunch of flowers is usually what women want but perhaps us men are a bit guilty of trying to think outside the box too much and I guess that's why some think that the remote is the key to being romantic.' Way to her heart: A surprise bunch of flowers and having dinner cooked for them was a welcome romantic gesture voted for by the women . However, some of the men admitted they felt wary of presenting a bouquet to their loved one in case it made them appear guilty of something. A fifth believed that their partner would get suspicious if they give them flowers when it wasn't a special occasion. The Welsh were the most likely to fear suspicion with 13 per cent highlighting this was a worry, compared to just eight per cent in the south west of England. It was something they needn't be worried about as only seven per cent of partners said they would be suspicious. When it comes to flowers, roses were the favourite choice for more than a quarter of women, followed by lilies. The study also found it's been almost two months since men got it right in the romance department, with women even having to tell their partner what they think is romantic to get what they want. Three in five (60 per cent) of the UK's long suffering females have to leave subtle hints around the house so their partner gets it right. Meanwhile, more than a third said they had to be very blunt and come straight out with it. It's not just men that are getting it wrong however; two in five women have to be told what their man finds romantic as well. Chocolates and flowers were found to be the most common gift both men and women receive from their partners. But while many believe that a gift from their other half should be worth £84.21, those Brits then go on to admit they only spend half of that (£42.65) when dipping into their own pockets for their partner. The research also discovered that Londoners have the highest expectation from a gift, saying £102.36 is a reasonable amount to be spent on them, compared to those in the West Midlands, who are happy to receive something worth £72.67. Those between the ages of 45-54 were found to be the most generous, with their most expensive gift costing £368.17.","Answers appeared in list of what British men think is romantic .

The British Geological Survey, which collected data on the quakes, said the strongest had a magnitude of 3.3 on the Richter Scale at a depth of three miles. It was recorded just before 10am. An earlier quake at around 5.30am measured 2.4. The . Irish National Seismic Network (INSN) said the quakes were probably caused . by stresses built up from the weight of glaciers covering land during . the Ice Age. Homes in Blackpool have been rocked by two earthquakes beneath the Irish Sea . INSN director . Tom Blake said it was unusual that the earthquakes - measuring 2.4 and . then a stronger 3.3 on the Richter scale - happened in the Irish Sea. Glen . Ford from the British Geological Survey said it could have been ‘quite . alarming’ and added: ‘Not many people experience earthquakes in the UK. There are only two or three of them a year of that size.’ Last year it was suggested that fracking tests in the region had caused tremors in Blackpool. 'It is impossible to tell if stronger earthquakes will occur in the coming days and weeks, but aftershocks can be expected even if most, if not all, will be too weak to be felt,' Mr Blake said. Social media users took to Twitter saying they felt the ground move beneath them - particularly in the north west of England. Twitter user Cathy Welsh, said: ‘The bed was shaking. I thought it was a big lorry going past.’ The strongest quake, at a depth of 5km, was recorded by the British Geological Survey shortly before 10am. The earlier and smaller quake was recorded at around 5.30am. Its epicentre was about 25km west of Fleetwood in Lancashire at a depth of 3km. The larger earthquake was also recorded by INSN seismometers as far away as Donegal and Wexford in Ireland. Last year it was suggested that fracking tests in the region had caused tremors in Blackpool . Mr Blake, from the School of Cosmic Physics in the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, said their cause was probably no different from other earthquakes in Britain and Ireland. 'Although Britain and Ireland are far from any plate boundaries, much of the region is still experiencing quakes due to the removal of the weight of ice sheets that once covered the land,' he said. 'Occasionally this post-glacial isostatic rebound - the phenomenon of the land surface gradually returning to its pre-glacial contours - results in earthquakes of this magnitude, particularly in the northern half of the islands.' A slightly larger earthquake was recorded in the Irish Sea back in May, which was felt in parts of Ireland and North Wales. The 3.8 magnitude tremor occurred 15km away from Abersoch in Gwynedd, Wales. People as far away as Dublin, Wexford, Wicklow and Kildare claimed they felt it at the time. According to the INSN, the largest known British earthquake struck near the Dogger Bank in the North Sea off the east coast of England in 1931, with a magnitude of 6.1. The largest to impact Ireland occurred on the Llyn peninsula, North Wales, in July 1984. The 5.4 magnitude earthquake was the largest ever recorded earthquake on mainland Britain and was felt throughout Ireland's east coast, Wales and England. Aftershocks from the quake measured up to 4.3 on the Richter scale and some structural damage resulted along the east coast of Ireland.","One tremor measured 3.3 on the Richter Scale at a depth of three miles .

Joy turned to sadness yesterday after a giant panda gave birth to a stillborn cub at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, grooming the lifeless cub before finally letting it fall to the floor after 17 minutes. Mei Xiang (may-SHONG), the zoo's 15-year-old female giant panda, gave birth to a healthy pink panda cub Friday night and zookeepers were eagerly awaiting the possible birth of a twin. As the first pictures of the dead cub’s twin looking vigorous and full of life are revealed, it has emerged that Mei Xiang gave birth a second time last night - but the twin was born motionless and subsequent examinations showed it suffered abnormalities and died in utero. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Newborn: Zookeepers were able to give the new cub a check-up this morning and say the baby is full of life and seems healthy in every way . Survivor: A vet takes a DNA sample from the new cub to determine who its father is . Newborn: Mei Xiang gave birth to a cub on Friday night at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington . Baby joy: The tiny pink cub, said to be only as big as a stick of butter, could be heard squealing after it was born at the Washington DC zoo . 'There is a chance, a 50 per cent chance, . that another panda will be born, a twin,' Dennis Kelly, the National . Zoo's director on Friday, said Friday. They had all but given up hope of a second cub when Mei Xiang gave birth to the motionless panda. The stillborn cub had abnormalities and 'had never been alive,'  zoo spokeswoman Pamela Baker-Masson said in a statement. 'It lay motionless and made no sound. Throughout, staff could see it visually and hear the first cub squealing, and Mei never set it down.' Zookeepers were able to remove the lifeless cub and saw that the cub suffered abnormalities. The zoo began performing a necropsy on the stillborn cub late Saturday that they hope will tell them why the cub stopped developing and died in utero, she said. Protective: Mei Xiang has not put down her newborn cub long enough for zookeepers to examine the baby panda, but there are high hopes for its health . Bittersweet: Zoo workers are celebrating the birth of a healthy giant panda cub while regretting the loss of its twin . Boy or girl: Vets say they won't know the new cub's sex or paternity for two weeks after its first neonatal exam . Worn out: After giving birth twice in two days and losing one of her precious cubs, Mei Xiang is fatigued but attentively caring for her new healthy cub . According to NBC's Today, Mei Xiang had been on a 24-hour pregnancy watch since her behavior became increasingly maternal and she began cradling her toys, licking her body and 'nesting.' The protective mother only allowed zoo staff close enough to examine the first healthy cub this morning. Brandie Smith, the zoo's curator of mammals compared the . planned exam to a race car pit stop, a fast and highly choreographed . checkup before reuniting mom and cub. The cub's first neonatal exam showed vets it is 'robust, fully formed, . and is a bright, healthy shade of pink,' tweeted the zoo. The zoo's account notes that it weighs 137 grams, which is . about 4.8 ounces and that its heart rate is steady. Vets were able to hear . breathing sounds from both lungs and its belly was full, indicating it is nursing. 'All signs are that we have a very healthy, active, vibrant . cub,' the zoo's account tweeted. The . check-up will enable vets to determine who exactly is the father of the . cub, since Mei Shang was artificially inseminated with sperm from both . the Smithsonian Zoo's Tian Tian and Gao Gao, a male giant panda from the . San Diego Zoo. The cub's paternity and sex won't be known until results come in in a couple of weeks. Who's the daddy? Pictured here are the possible fathers Gao Gao (left) and Tian Tian (right) Big brother: Tai Shan was born to Mei Xiang in 2005, and was her only surviving offspring until this latest birth .

The tiny cub was the third pregnancy for Mei Shang, who tragically lost another cub six days after giving birth last year. Its lungs hadn't fully developed and likely weren't sending enough oxygen to its liver. She gave birth to a healthy cub, a male called Tai Shan, in 2005. Visitors to the zoo Saturday said they were excited about another panda cub. Melissa Schmechel, of Alexandria, Virginia, said she spent about 30 minutes Friday watching the zoo's online panda cam after it was announced on Facebook and Twitter that Mei Xiang had gone into labor. She said she and her family had made plans to visit the zoo last year after the birth of Mei Xiang's second cub and were sad when it died. 'Hopefully this will have a better outcome,' she said as her 11-year-old daughter, Laura, hugged a newly purchased stuffed panda.","Mei Shang, the Smithsonian National Zoo's female giant panda, had a healthy cub Friday before giving birth to its stillborn twin yesterday .

Scroll down for video . A 'stupid' mistake: Gill started crying as she explained her reasons for stepping down from her position Tuesday . Kendra McKenzie Gill, 18-year-old Utah beauty contest winner, was arrested on felony charges for throwing bombs . Giving up her title: Gill said it took hard work to win the title of Miss Riverton, and the $2,000 scholarship that comes with it, so giving it all up was a difficult decision . On Friday Gill was formally charged with possession of an explosive device, along with friends Bryce Christopher Stone, John Patrick Reagh and Shanna Marie Smith. Felony bomb possession is punishable by 1 to 15 years in prison. The 18-year-olds were arrested August 3 after driving around neighborhoods and allegedly tossing 8 oz plastic bottles filled with caustic chemicals at people they knew. All four teens acknowledged they were tossing bombs powered by a toilet bowl cleaner reacting with aluminum foil on sidewalks, front yards or in streets 'to scare some of their other friends,' Unified Fire Authority investigator Steve Bowen said in a court affidavit. 'We don't really understand a clear reason for their behavior,' prosecutor Blake Nakamura said.

Gill called the act a 'stupid mistake' but that she and her friends never aimed the bombs at anyone. 'We didn’t think about what we were doing at the time,' she said. 'We didn’t know that it would get to this point. We meant for it to be a practical joke and never had any intentions to harm anyone at all.'

'This goes well beyond a teenage prank.' 'They're very caustic, very nasty. So they can cause injury to somebody just if the chemicals get on somebody, much less the fragmentation of the shrapnel damage that can be caused,' Mecham told the television station.

Gill's attorney Wally Bugden thinks the charges are overkill and that her title of Miss Riverton is almost being held against her. 'You could say it's possible that the chemical could splash someone, but that certainly was not their intetion,' Bugden said. 'They weren't trying to harm anyone. They were playing a prank.' Gill was crowned Miss Riverton, topping a slate of nine beauty contestants earlier this summer in the Salt Lake City suburb. She showed off years of piano training with a Scott Joplin number and took home a $2,000 scholarship. It took a lot of hard work to win that title and scholarship, so giving it up was pretty difficult for Gill. 'I just (knew) … I would probably have to get it taken away from me, just because of the contract. So I’d rather have it be my decision now than to have someone take it from me,' she said. One of Gill's friends claims they were throwing the bombs as a prank, however, authorities said someone could have been gravely injured by the explosives . Her parents also weighed in on the rebellious act. Her mother, Michelle Gill, said it was hard to get mad at her daughter knowing that her intentions were good. Her father Gavin Gill described the past week the hardest of his life, but he's confident that the situation will sort itself out. 'I’m confident that the legal system will handle it correctly, and the people that understand the facts of what’s going on and the character of all four of the youngsters that are involved in this will see this and handle it appropriately,' he said. Gill herself remains optimistic that the situation will be positive in the end. 'I do believe this whole thing is a way to help us grow and to learn from our mistakes and to move forward and just kind of get on with our lives.'","Kendra Gill stepped down from her position as Miss Riverton Tuesday .

Joseph Messina (pictured) was given 30 month probation for attack on Eric Bartels that left him paralyzed . A man who left a father paralyzed and blind after attacking him outside a bar walked free from court, yesterday. Father-of-one Eric Bartels is now unable to speak after the 'unprovoked' attack by Joseph Messina, 25, in Mokena, Illinois, in 2009. Despite his severe injuries, Messina escaped an immediate jail sentence and was given just 30 months of probation and ordered to undertake 250 hours of community service, by Will County Judge Sarah Jones. State attorney James Glasgow said he believed there was enough evidence to justify a prison sentence. He told the Chicago Tribune: 'The injuries to Eric Bartels are a hair's breadth from murder. 'This isn't a broken nose. The seriousness of the offense can be taken into account in determining the appropriate punishment.' Judge Jones told the court that her decision was based on the law and not emotion. Messina served 59 days in the county jail. During Messina's trial at the beginning of the year, it was said that Messina threw the first punch after Bartels allegedly make a remark about a bloodstain on his shirt. Prosecutor said Messina punched Bartels to the ground and then hit him once more. It was said in court that Messina then held his hands in the air while straddling Bartels, according to the Chicago Tribune. Mr Bartels was punched to the ground after allegedly making a remark to Messina in a Mokena (pictured) bar . Messina was found guilty of aggravated battery in January. Judge Jones ordered Messina to pay $630 a month during the probation period to Jan Bartels, the victim's mother, to help pay for medical costs. The $20,000 bond put up by Messina's family will also be paid to the victim. According to the Chicago Tribune, Messina faces 180-days in county jail if he drinks alcohol while on probation.","Joseph Messina given 30 months probation for punching Eric Bartels .

Eerie: The Open House was created using materials from an abandoned house (pictured) in Alabama.

The unique house is already being used by residents, who helped built it using materials from an abandoned house that once stood on the site .

The ground was then levelled out by setting the remaining debris on fire. The fire brigade then put the flames out, which in turn flattened the area.

Designer Matthew Mazzotta said:¿Open House lives mostly in the form of a house between the grocery store and the post office, reminding people what was there before, but it opens up when the community wants to enjoy shows, plays and movies' To unfold the house, the five sections along thetop ridge are pulled out and down. There are hinges along the ground with seams that sit around halfway down each side of the roof. The larger sections are lowered down in two stages, but because of the size and weight of the sections, this needs to be done a team of at least three people. Once fully unfolded, five rows of seating in three lines face an open arena. ‘Open House lives mostly in the form of a house between the grocery store and the post office, reminding people what was there before, but it opens up when the community wants to enjoy shows, plays, movies,’ said Mazzotta. ‘People took right to it and started dancing and having a good time,’ he told Dezeen.

If you want to measure the strength of Britain’s economic recovery, look in the hands of children. There has been a 52p annual rise in pocket money to £6.50 a week, plus a greater proportion of youngsters are now receiving a handout from mum and dad. Children are picking up the most pocket money on average since 2007, in a further sign that families are starting to feel better about the economy. Cashing in: British children are being given the highest amount of pocket money since 2007 . A survey by Halifax also found a rise in the proportion of children receiving pocket money from 77 per cent in 2012 to 84 per cent now as households ease their purse strings. But there also appears to be gender ‘pay gap’ similar to that seen in the workplace, with boys receiving more money from their parents than girls – £6.67 as opposed to £6.32. However, girls are more accepting of what they receive. Just over one third (38 per cent) think they should get more, compared with almost half (44 per cent) of boys. Children in the North West  are the most likely to receive pocket money, at 90 per cent, while those in the South East are the least likely at 78 per cent, according to the survey of more than 1,200 children aged between eight and 15. For millions of people, the middle-class idyll is becoming a distant mirage. Today, many people are starting to realise they will probably never enjoy the comforts their parents took for granted . But it is young Londoners who receive most – £8.46 on average – while those in the South West receive least, at £6.26. While children need to be aged 16 before they can register for their own online banking, the survey found that one in 12 (8 per cent) used the internet in some way to manage their cash. Halifax said the positive shift in pocket money ‘reflects a growing confidence in the current economic environment’. Evidence of the improving economy has recently been shown in areas such as spending, with retail sales rising. And the Treasury said last week that Britain was ‘moving from rescue to recovery’ after the release of better than expected growth figures.","Children are receiving the most pocket money since 2007 .

Sussex Police confirmed it was investigating reports of a man who had been seen lurking in bushes near Crawley shortly after placing a baby doll by the side of the road. Drama: The storyline from BBC1 show Casualty featured a baby doll left at the side of a country lane . Sussex Police had initially refused to . investigate believing it to be an online urban myth that 'surfaces . periodically', but backtracked when more witnesses came forward. The episode, called Bedside Manner, aired on August 3, just three days before the force first started receiving reports of a similar real-life crime. It features a couple, Elliot and Susan, who are driving along a country road when they spot what they think is a real baby abandoned on the verge in a car seat. When Elliot gets out to check the baby is all right - only to find it is a child's toy - he is set upon by three men wearing sackcloths over their faces. As two of the thugs beat him up, one of them approaches Susan, who is still in the car, and smashes her window before grabbing her handbag. She drives at the robber, knocking him over before swerving and plunging down a hill. On August 6, motorists reported to police that they had seen a man 'lurking in the bushes' by a roundabout in Bewbush in West Sussex, after first placing a doll by the side of the road.

Several witnesses stated online that the scam was 'similar to the storyline in Casualty' aired three days earlier. One, with the username gcunningham212, wrote: 'This is exactly the same as what happened on Casualty. 'Robbers lie in wait for someone to stop and check on the baby and then attack them. Scary.'

'When you exit from your vehicle in attempt to help, the gangs jump out - they have beaten women to near death, and then rape them. 'Their goal is to torture the victims to death in any way possible.

A 9-year-old survivor of last year's tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut has found comfort in a place many people wouldn't expect: a stocky, 73-pound pit bull named Jeffrey. While many would see Jeffrey and run for the hills, Sandy Hook fourth-grader Emma Wishneski considers him one of her closest friends - she even plans to bring a miniature, stuffed version of the dog with her on her upcoming first day of school. Despite his hulking size - and unwarranted bad reputation - Jeffrey is a registered therapy dog whose job it is to put a smile on the face of a human who may be having a tough time, or suffering from a serious injury or disease. Therapy: Emma Wishneski 'never stops smiling' when she's with her friend Jeffrey, a 73-pound pit bull . Buds: Sandy Hook 9-year-old Emma Wishneski and therapy pit bull Jeffrey have developed a strong bond . Lucky dog: Jeffrey was a stray scheduled to be euthanized when he was adopted by Michele Houston in 2010 . And Jeffrey is very good at his job. 'It all starts with a belly rub,' Jeffrey's owner, Michele Houston, told NBC's Today. 'He meets you, he flops on his back. Then his magic starts.' Jeffrey's healing powers almost were never realized - two years ago, he was one of hundreds of pit bulls in the New York City shelter system that was likely to be euthanized. Then a pit bull rescue group called Bruised Not Broken took an interest and attempted to find him a home by placing him on its advocacy website. Ms. Houston, a hospice worker in Milford, Connecticut, found Jeffrey on the website and offered to adopt him just hours before he was scheduled to be euthanized. Ms. Houston was never worried about Jeffrey being a pit bull - a breed of dog that has a stereotype of being aggressive and dangerous, a stigma Ms. Houston hopes to change. 'Both ends of the leash are responsible for the future of these dogs,' said Houston, who also brings Jeffrey to assisted living facilities, . hospitals and school libraries to connect with elderly people, the sick, . and struggling young readers. Flying colors: Houston had Jeffrey tested to see if he could be a therapy dog. He passed with 'flying colors' Popular pooch: Jeffrey has more than 700 Facebook followers and a full schedule of therapy sessions . At 73 pounds, Jeffrey will curl into a ball and roll onto his back on command. He'll then paw the air with his signature painted toe nails, inviting people in for a belly rub. After adopting Jeffrey, Ms. Houston enrolled him in obedience training and ultimately took him to the American Kennal Club to have him tested to become certified for therapy. 'He . passed with flying colors,' she recalled. 'The examiner, he said if you . don't make this dog a therapy dog it would be a shame.' Now, . Jeffrey is known as the 'Positively Peaceful Pit Bull,' and has more . than 700 Facebook fans, as well as a full schedule of therapy visits in the . tri-state area. But Emma remains one of his favorite clients. '""Emma"" is a special word in our house,” Houston said. Emma and Jeffrey first met in December - just weeks after the senseless shooting spree that left 28 people dead, including 20 first-grade students - at a Christmas party for her classmates. Emma was thankfully tardy the day of the shooting and missed horrific event thanks to a doctor appointment that morning. But she lost several friends and teachers. Bad rep: Pit bulls like Jeffrey have a bad reputation as being aggressive and dangerous - a stigma Houston hopes to change . Stylish: Jeffrey's signature painted toe nails are a hit amongst his many fans . 'It was still a really vulnerable time for her, and she . just was comfortable sitting next to Jeffrey,' Emma's mother, . Marykay Wishneski, told Today. 'He's strong and I think she just feels safe.' The day after their initial meeting, Emma asked her mother if she could see the friendly pooch again, so Ms. Wishneski got in touch with Ms. Houston to arrange another play date for the two - the first of many. 'I think for her, there's a security in . that it's a dog and not another person,' Ms. Wishneski said. 'Emma becomes . free and runs and plays and smiles. It's a very tender thing between the . two of them.' Jeffrey even attended Emma's 9th birthday party in April. He was wearing a hat in the shape of a birthday cake and let Emma and her friends climb all over him. After getting to know her new friend, Emma wants to be a veterinarian, and has helped her family train a Wheaton-Doodle they adopted. 'I think that she loves that Jeffrey is a therapy dog — that he has a . job and that there's something special about him,' Ms. Wishneski said.

A paranoid schizophrenic drug addict, who falsely accused a police officer of rape and threatened to tell Jeremy Kyle unless he received £30,000, is behind bars. Simon Dylan Phillips, 44, was sent to prison for more than four years after he admitted blackmailing a serving police officer. Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard Phillips had sent a CD and notes to the officer's brother claiming he had raped a member of Phillips' family when she was just 14. When the grandfather had been interviewed by police after the first note was delivered, he had denied sending it. But the court heard Phillips, of Mount Pleasant in Merthyr Vale, had continued to send the threatening correspondence. In his last letter he demanded the money and a three-bedroom house to be put in his name. If he did not get his way he threatened to tell not only tell his victim's wife, but also the media, including the popular daytime TV presenter Jeremy Kyle. John Ryan, prosecuting, said the blackmailing had taken place between February 12 and March 1. In February the officer, who has not been named, received a phone call from a local man to say that he had been contacted by Phillips over the false allegations. Mr Ryan said: 'This shocked him.' Police questioned Phillips, but he had denied any knowledge of the phone call. However, repeated notes then started to arrive at the officer's brother's house, the last of which demanded the house and money. Defending Phillips, Lucy Crowther blamed the blackmail offence on his addiction to drugs and his paranoid schizophrenia. She said: 'He is quite able to see in sobriety that his delusions about the officer were wholly based in his own wandering mind. Blackmail: Phillips even went to the lengths of threatening to go to TV presenter Jeremy Kyle in his attempt to extort cash and a house . 'He has an extensive and supportive family including those who have had to put up with his behaviour and paranoia for some time. “This has been an utter wake up call . for him to realise that it is now time to put the grandchildren first . and support his family as best he can and to overcome his addiction.' At the time of the offence, Phillips . was already on bail for drugs offences after he was found with £3,657 of . cannabis and amphetamine, which he had claimed he was keeping safe for a . family member. But Phillips, who has appeared in court 11 times in connection for 32 offences, later admitted possessing the drugs with intent to supply. Judge Richard Twomlow jailed Phillips for a total of four years and three months, describing the allegations he made as 'scurrilous'. He added: 'There was considerable planning and the aim of financial reward.' Phillips will have to pay a £120 victim surcharge and the drugs were ordered to be forfeited and destroyed.","Grandfather was jailed for four years for 'scurrilous' allegations .

One in three care home businesses is at risk of going bust due to ‘off-the-scale’ levels of borrowing, according to research published today. An examination of the accounts of nearly 5,000 companies, responsible for 20,000 care homes across the UK, will ring alarm bells following the collapse of Southern Cross. Formerly the largest operator in the sector, Southern Cross went under in 2011 when it was unable to pay a £250million rent bill, bringing misery and anxiety to more than 30,000 elderly residents and their families. At risk: Borrowing at thousands of care home operators in Britain is 'off the scale' The report, compiled by Company Watch – a specialist in assessing the financial strength of firms – suggests that hundreds of smaller operators are at similar risk. Of the firms it surveyed, 1,449 were placed in its ‘Warning Area’ after being considered ‘financially vulnerable’ and at high risk of going under. The research also found that almost 700 care home companies are ‘zombie’ businesses, with liabilities worth more than their assets. Their combined negative net worth came in at £217million. The investigation found that the average care home has ‘unusually high’ gearing levels at 82 per cent. Gearing measures debt as a proportion of a company’s net assets. Nick Hood, an insolvency specialist who conducted the research, said he decided to investigate the finances of the industry in the wake of the Southern Cross collapse. ‘I wanted to see whether it was an exceptional case of corporate vanity and too much borrowing, or whether it was typical of the entire sector,’ he said. He said the high level of debt in the sector, which is dominated by small companies running one or two care homes, will put many firms at risk when interest rates rise. ‘The aspect I find most worrying is the gearing figure of 82 per cent,’ he said. ‘That is off the scale in terms of normal accounting conventions. Most companies would not be happy with a gearing level of above 60 to 65 per cent. ‘The worrying thing is that we are five years into a regime with an exceptionally low level of interest rates. ‘What is going to happen to this sector when, not if, there is an increase in interest rates?’ Vulnerable: 85-year-old Dorothy Urwin was a resident at a Southern Cross Care Home and had to move . The report assessed companies using a points system with a maximum score of 100. It found that 1,449 care home businesses had a health rating of 25 points or less, putting them in the ‘Warning Area’, which experience suggests gives them a one in four chance of needing a financial rescue. Mr Hood said many homes have run into dire financial straits after being hit by a ‘triple whammy’. ‘They are overborrowed, they lack income because there has been pressure on local authority budgets, which means they cannot increase the fees they charge, and regulation has increased their costs,’ he said. ‘The profitability of care homes is being relentlessly squeezed and this is something the Government has to face up to. Either we believe as a society in providing care for the elderly or we don’t.’ He said that on the positive side, although ‘an exceptional number of care homes are financially vulnerable’ the banks that have lent the money ‘will do anything to avoid the potential negative publicity’ from calling in the loans. Ros Altmann, a leading campaigner for the elderly and former government adviser on retirement, said the problem of debt was ‘rife’ across the whole care sector. ‘It is deeply worrying that the most vulnerable members of our society may be being cared for by companies that are themselves financially vulnerable,’ she said. ‘The consequences of failure in this sector go far beyond finance.’ Under plans unveiled earlier this year, the Care Quality Commission is to start making checks on the finances of care homes.","1,449 care home businesses are at high risk of going under .

'I saw [my son’s] demeanor. I saw the two weeks after that. I don’t think he did it,' Barney Fowler told NBC News. The boy, who pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder charges in May, initially told investigators that a stranger had broken into their Valley Springs home and attacked his sister. Support: Barney Fowler is standing by his 12-year-old son who is accused of killing his eight-year-old sister .

'I went in and carried my daughter’s . body out and was gonna take her to the hospital because I felt she was . still alive,' he said. 'The little bit I saw that no one else saw, I won’t talk about,' he added. The Calaveras County coroner said that Leila died of shock and hemorrhaging caused by multiple stab wounds. Two weeks after her death, Leila's brother was named as a suspect and Mr Fowler had to turn him in, according to ABC 7. Mr Fowler's fiancée, Crystal Walters, said: 'The community wants answers.

A lawyer appointed to look out for the best interests of a three-year-old Cherokee girl at the center of an adoption dispute has asked a judge to suspend visitation rights for her adoptive parents. It comes as a complete turnaround after the South Carolina court awarded the Capobiancos custody of Veronica on July 31st. Angel Smith filed a motion in Cherokee County District Court in Oklahoma on Friday asking the judge to suspend the right for Matt and Melanie Capobianco to see Veronica pending a hearing. Adoptive parents Matt and Melanie Copabianco seen entering the Cherokee County Courthouse, in Tahlequah, Okla. on August 16 . Dusten Brown (second from left) enters the Cherokee County Courthouse with his wife Robin Brown on August 16 for the hearing . The Capobiancos have filed a motion objecting to the stay. Veronica's birth father, Dusten Brown, is a member of the Cherokee Nation. Her birth mother is not. Brown is pushing for custody of the girl under the Indian Child Welfare Act. The court document comes after the biological father of the girl turned himself in to authorities on August 12, but refused extradition to South Carolina. That's where Veronica's adoptive parents Matt and Melanie Capobianco live and where state authorities had finalized Veronica's adoption and charged Brown with 'custodial interference' for refusing to turn over the girl. 'This is my daughter,' Brown said, according to Anderson Cooper 360. 'It isn't a yoyo I borrowed for two years.' Brown posted $10,000 bond and was released on August 12, according to Oklahoma's Sequoyah County Sheriff's Office. Brown was charged with custodial interference after failing to appear at a court-ordered meeting in South Carolina. He was refused extradition without a governor's warrant from South Carolina. Handed Himself Over: Dusten Brown (left and right with his daughter Veronica) Matt and Melanie Capobianco pictured with baby Veronica, who they brought up from 2009 . Brown's lawyer, Robert Nigh, said his client was caught between competing jurisdictions and is 'making every effort to do the right thing for himself and his daughter.' Nigh refused to say where Brown is currently. He's due in court again on September 11. The James Island, South Carolina parents have been trying to adopt Veronica since her birth in 2009. after which they raised the girl for two years. But Brown has had custody of his daughter since 2011, when South Carolina's Supreme Court ruled that a 1978 federal law written to ensure Native American children stay with Native American parents gave him preference over the Capobiancos. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the law does not apply in this case because the biological father never had custody of Veronica and abandoned her before birth. Veronica plays dress-up as her biological father's wife Robin Brown (right) watches at the Cherokee Nation Jack Brown Center in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, on August 6 . Veronica swings in the back yard of the Cherokee Nation Jack Brown Center in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, on August 6 .

'Send . someone to the location our daughter is being held and work with us to . bring her home. No more delays and no more excuses,' Matt Capobianco . said during a news conference. 'Our daughter has been kidnapped, and I expect the situation to be treated as such.' Brown . had never met his daughter and, after Veronica's non-Indian mother . rebuffed his marriage proposal, played no role during the pregnancy and . paid no child support after the girl was born. The . legal proceedings began when Brown found out Veronica was going to be . adopted. He objected and said the Indian Child Welfare Act favored the . girl living with him and growing up learning tribal traditions. Veronica, her biological father Dusten Brown, feed their geese and ducks at his home in Oklahoma where she has lived for the past 19 months . 'I'm always going to be her daddy': Dusten Brown and daughter Veronica met for the first time on New Year's Eve 2011 . The Capobiancos appealed the South Carolina Supreme Court's 2011 decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, and it ruled in June that South Carolina courts should decide who gets to adopt Veronica. The state court said the Capobiancos should raise the girl. South Carolina Family Court Judge Daniel Martin finalized the couple's adoption at the end of July, approving a transition plan detailing a gradual process for reintroducing the girl to the Capobiancos. South Carolina authorities issued a warrant for Brown's arrest on August 10, charging Brown with custodial interference for failing to appear with the girl for a court-ordered meeting with the Capobiancos on August 4th — a date the couple has said was set by the judge and to which Brown's attorneys did not object.","Melanie and Matt Capobianco of James Island, S.C., have been trying to .

Warning: Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks said society was failing to protect institutions such as marriage . Britain is ‘losing the plot’ as it becomes more secular and less trusting, the Chief Rabbi has warned. Lord Sacks, who retires on Sunday, said society was failing to protect institutions such as marriage – with grave consequences. ‘I think we’re losing the plot actually,’ he said. ‘I think we haven’t really noticed what’s happened in Britain. ‘When you begin to lose faith and society becomes very, very secularised, you see a breakdown of institutions, whether they are financial or economic, or marriage as an institution. 'Then you ask “Why have they broken down?”, and you arrive at one word, which is trust.’ Last week Lord Sacks warned that the Government had ‘not done enough’ to support marriage. He urged ministers to finally introduce a promised tax break for married couples, and said mothers who stayed at home to raise their children deserved more recognition. However, yesterday he added that politicians were only partly responsible for the decline of marriage. He claimed the permissive attitudes of the Sixties had left marriage in ‘disarray’ and children worse-off. ‘It’s not the fault of one government or another, and it’s not even the fault of government,’ he said. ‘It’s the fault of what we call culture, which is society talking to itself.’ New man: Lord Sacks will soon be succeeded by Ephraim Mirvis (pictured), the former Chief Rabbi of Ireland . Of the Sixties, he said: ‘We were in that revolution, and at the time it seemed to be “all you need is love” and nothing else. 'We live to see, 50 years later, the full cost of that ... child poverty that has a lot to do with single- parent families. The internet is fuelling intolerance and hatred, according to Lord Sacks. He said he has grown increasingly alarmed by how hate-filled material can be spread on social networks with apparent impunity. The Chief Rabbi, who will continue to campaign on the issue after he retires next week, said the law should be extended to force internet service providers and the owners of social networks and other websites to remove material that would otherwise be classed as ‘hate speech’. He said: ‘It’s very difficult, but they do have to be vigilant, and they have to take hate speech off their websites as soon as they discover it.’ He stressed that he was not against new technology – Lord Sacks has his own Facebook and Twitter accounts – but highlighted the damaging effects of  the anonymity available online. ‘We are worried about the social media because you can post abusive comments without the person being in your physical presence,’ he said. ‘That anonymity and that distance mean that the internet is one of the great carriers of prejudice and paranoia, and I don’t take it lightly.’ Lord Sacks also said he remains opposed to gay marriage - but warned against ‘whipping up prejudice’ against homosexuals. ‘No-one wants to lay a burden of guilt on anyone who bought into the cultural attitudes of the Sixties, but the fact is, their kids are suffering.’ Lord Sacks, who has been Chief Rabbi for 22 years, lamented the rise of selfishness, and called on politicians to work with faith groups to create a more caring country. ‘Individualism is no way to build a society,’ he said. ‘If people work for the maximum possible benefit for themselves then we will not have trust in industry, in economics, in financial institutions; we will not see marriages last.’ In wide-ranging interviews to mark his retirement, he also called for the Government to act now to tackle the housing crisis. He said it was ‘morally unacceptable’ that many youngsters were no longer able to afford a home in the town where they work. However, despite his warnings, he insisted he is ‘full of hope’ for the future – not least because of the popularity of faith schools. He said many people shared his concerns about society, adding: ‘It is why so many non-believing parents send their children to faith schools – they want their children to grow up with a strong moral sense.’ Lord Sacks – who will be succeeded by Ephraim Mirvis, former Chief Rabbi of Ireland – also called for more action to tackle the persecution of Christian minorities in the Middle East. ‘This is a story which is crying out for a public voice,’ he said.","Lord Sacks says society is failing to protect institutions such as marriage .

Ms Siebert moved to New York from Cleveland in 1954, when she was 22, and started her career as a research trainee at Bache & Co. earning $65 a week. Pioneer: Muriel Siebert, pictured in 1977, was the first woman to own a seat on the New York Stock Exchange . She went on to become an industry specialist in airlines and aerospace, and later became a partner at brokerages including Brimberg & Co. Ms Siebert, who had the brash attitude associated with Wall Street, bought a seat on the New York Stock Exchange in December 1967 after months of struggling with the male-dominated business world that initially resisted her efforts to join. The advocate for women's rights left . three jobs because men doing the same work were being paid made more than her, and quickly . discovered the only way to get a response from her resume was to use her . initials rather her first name. She established her investment firm the same year that she bought her seat and transformed it into a discount brokerage house in 1975. However, she was angered that it was another decade before another woman made it to the stock exchange. 'For 10 years it was 1,365 men and me,' Ms Siebert, who never married or had children, told the New York Times. Outnumbered: For ten years Muriel Siebert, pictured at her desk in 1968, was the only woman in an office of 1,365 men . Dedicated: Muriel Siebert, in Manhattan in 2001, was New York's first woman superintendent of banking . Success: Muriel Siebert closes trading on her 30th anniversary at the stock exchange in 1998 . After being appointed New York state's first woman superintendent of banking in 1977, she put her company in blind trust, to be run by the employees, for five years. As interest rates climbed steeply and bank failures became common, Ms Siebert created protective measures to prevent banks from failing in New York. She reorganized troubled banks, forced mergers, and convinced the federal government to advance millions of dollars to make the new mergers viable. She persuaded stronger institutions to help weaker ones. 'Money represents power to men, but to me it represents freedom,' she told the New York Times in 2002.  'Once I joined the exchange, I always felt I had to prove I bought the seat not for publicity but for the business.' In 1982, Ms Siebert resigned to run for the Republican nomination for a U.S. Senate seat, coming second to state lawmaker, Florence Sullivan. After her campaign, the woman who raised awareness about workplace discrimination, and lobbied to have a woman's restroom established in the stock exchange, returned to her company. She said her approach to any obstacles was always to 'put my head down and charge'. Determined: Siebert served on several organizations to promote women in business . Trailblazer: Known as Mickie to her friends, Siebert, seen here in 1995, started out as a trainee . To celebrate 30 years as a member of the exchange, Ms Siebert was invited to ring the closing bell in the stock exchange on January 5, 1998. The following year, while president of the New York Women's Agenda - a coalition of more than 100 women's organizations - Ms Siebert developed a personal finance program to improve the financial literacy of young people. It became part of the New York City high schools economics curriculum for seniors, and Ms Siebert, who never married or had children, worked to expand the program nationally. Siebert served on several organizations including the Council on Foreign Relations, the International Women's Forum, Deloitte & Touche's Council for the Advancement and Retention of Women, and the New York Women's Forum, for which she was a founder and president. 'She always pushed the doors open and kept them open for other people to follow,' Ms Macon told Associated Press. No fear: Muriel Siebert, with her chihuahua Monster Girl, braved a man's world and helped change it . 'Mickie was a pioneer and recognized as a leader throughout the financial services industry and beyond,' Siebert Financial chief operating officer Joseph Ramos said in a prepared statement. 'Those of us who worked with her will miss her spirit, leadership and great commitment to her clients and the securities markets.' In recent years Ms Siebert, who died at a cancer center in New York, was known for being accompanied by her long-haired chihuahua, Monster Girl.","Siebert was first businesswoman to own a seat on the New York Stock Exchange .

A Guatemalan man who was born severely deformed has opened up about the incredible surgery, and generous people, he found in America that helped him to turn his life around. Martin Oliva-Torres' widespread eyes and a bulging forehead brought him scorn and ridicule as a young man living near Guatemala City and even his family treated him like a monster. His mother died three months after his birth and his father promptly abandoned the family, leaving his grandmother in charge. But the now-52-year-old high school custodian said she beat him regularly and fed him scraps, specifically chicken leftovers. All smiles: Glancing into the mirror, his black hair perfectly in place and his smile wide, the once-deformed Martin Oliva-Torres jokes: 'Man, I'm so handsome' 'I would ask for the legs, and I got the feet,' he recalled to The Dallas Morning News. Oliva-Torres wasn't allowed to go to school, and his facial deformities meant no one would give him a job. At 23, he finally found work washing cars but the downtrodden man, whose deformities impaired his vision and his breathing, used the cash to buy alcohol and cigarettes. 'I was angry,' he said. 'I was angry with myself, the people.' But in December 1984 his luck changed. Oliva-Torres was standing in the street when an American woman named 'Angie' pulled over in a Jeep and asked him whether he wanted to go to the United States to see a doctor. Before: This 1984 photo provided by Martin Oliva-Torres shows Oliva-Torre at age 24 with a severe craniofacial abnormality that severely impacted the quality of his life . She took him to an orphanage for disfigured children where Oliva-Torres saw others just like him and felt less alone, he told the newspaper. After filling out the necessary paperwork, he packed his few belongings and prepared to board a flight to America. He was given an abandoned 14-month-old boy named Bernie, who had a large protrusion between his eyes and a fever, to take with him. Washington-based nonprofit, Healing . the Children, flew the two to Houston and then they were driven to . Dallas, where craniofacial surgeon, Dr Kenneth Salyer, would change . Oliva-Torres' life forever. A selfless couple, Zane and Phyllis Jude, took in the Spanish-speaking Oliva-Torres, Bernie and a 9-year-old from Mexico who was born without ears, despite not sharing their language and having to communicate by sign. 'I did it because I heard the voice of God,' Zane Jude told the Morning News. 'And if I had to do it all over, I'd do it again. He added: 'Would you believe me if I told you I didn't even see their deformities?' The strangers bonded immediately. 'Phyllis came up and gave us a hug. It was something, because I never had that from my own grandma' said Oliva-Torres, who for the first time had regular meals and a bed. Just over a year after he arrived in the U.S., Oliva-Torres underwent his first of a series of surgeries, all of which would be performed at no cost to him. Salyer said he doesn't know whether Oliva-Torres' deformities were a result of poor prenatal care or genetics because so little is known about his family's medical history. 'All I knew was here was another young human being who was absolutely not accepted by society and was totally down and out,' he told the Morning News. The doctors removed 20 millimeters of bone between his eyes, rebuilt his forehead and created a new nose with excess skin, Salyer said. Happy now: In this July 31, 2013 photo, Martin Oliva-Torres gets a hug from Kaden Brunk, 3, of Palmer while his wife, Delores Torres, looks on before services at Palmer First Assembly of God in Palmer, Texas . As his face began to change Oliva-Torres' taught himself English by reading Bibles in English and Spanish side by side and landed his first job at the Salvation Army in Dallas. Oliva-Torres later would meet his future wife, Delores, in church. The couple now live in Palmer, 30 minutes outside Dallas. 'He's my inspiration,' she said. But even as his appearance improved, something was missing. 'It was awesome to see the change in my face,' he said, 'but inside — the inside wasn't changed.'One day he started praying along with a religious sermon on TV, and found it helped. He found strength in his newfound faith. After many years, he was able to forgive his grandmother, his community and himself. Now, once a month, he gives a sermon in Spanish at Palmer First Assembly of God about the importance of forgiveness and posts inspirational messages daily on his Facebook page. 'He's very enthusiastic,' said First Assembly of God pastor Carmen Ingram. 'He loves to pray for people. He's very sensitive in the spirit.' Glancing into the mirror, his black hair perfectly in place and his smile wide, Oliva-Torres joked: 'Man, I'm so handsome.' But his appreciation for the incredible chance he was given to change his life is no joke. 'I'm living in a dream. It's a long dream I haven't woken up from... I'm blessed,' he said.","Martin Oliva-Torres' bulging forehead brought him scorn and ridicule as a young man in Guatemala .

Relatives of an Ohio couple who died at a nursing home 11 hours apart on the same day say their love story's ending reflects their devotion over 65 years of marriage. The Dayton Daily News reports that Harold J 'Doc' Knapke, 91, and Ruth L Knapke, 89, died in their shared room at Versailles Health Care Center on August 11, days before their 66th anniversary. Their daughters say they believe their father willed himself to stay with his wife despite failing health until they could take the next step in their journey together. He went first; she followed. Wedded bliss: The Knapkes married in 1947, but Ruth Knapke had loved 'Doc' since they were children . 'It is really just a love story,' their daughter Carol Romie told the Dayton Daily News. Great love: The Knapkes were married for 65 years before they both died peacefully within hours of each other . 'They were so committed and loyal and dedicated, they weren't going to go anywhere without the other one.' Ruth 'Ruthie' Schmitz was born in St. Henry, Ohio, and her husband, 'Doc' Knapke was born in Coldwater. According to the Dayton Daily News, Ruthie Schmitz had had a crush on Doc Knapke since the third grade. Knapke was an Army lieutenant in service in Germany during World War II when he and Schmitz began writing to each other. 'I let him chase me until I caught him!' was how Ruth Knapke described the couple's courtship. The Knapkes were married August 20, 1947, in St. Henry, Ohio. They . went on to have seven children, tragically losing their son Jeffrey in . infancy, 14 grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. Doc . Knapke was a beloved teacher, principal, coach and athletic director at . Fort Recovery Schools and a former co-owner of Miracle Lanes Bowling . Alley, Fort Recovery. He was eventually inducted into the Fort Recovery Athletic Hall of Fame and the Fort Recovery Alumni Hall of Fame. Sportsman: Harold Knapke was a sophomore when he was on the basketball team at Dayton University Ohio in 1942 . Tribute: The couple left behind a loving family of eight children and 14 grandchildren . Eternal rest: The Knapkes were active at their local church and asked that in lieu of gifts at their funeral, attendees donate to the Harold and Ruth Knapke Scholarship fund . Daughter Margaret Knapke says she believes her father, whose health wasn't good over the last few years of his life, was staying alive for her mother. 'In recent years, we often speculated that Dad was still here, in this life, because of Mom. It seemed that, even though his health and strength were so very diminished, he couldn't stop being her protector; it seemed he didn't want to leave her behind,' she told the Dayton Daily News. A photograph of the couple taken in June shows the couple's tenderness toward each other. Doc is napping in his bed at the hospital, but still holding hands with Ruthie through the the guard rail. During the last week of her life, Ruth Knapke developed a severe infection and her children knew the prognosis wasn't good. In heaven: The couple would have celebrated their 66th wedding anniversary on 20 August, nine days after they died . The Knapke children told their father that his wife wasn't going to make it and say he spent a sleepless night worrying. 'The next day, Friday, there was a certain calm about him, and he began to fail rapidly. As you might know, Dad died 11 hours before Mom did - both of them on Sunday - and we believe he did that as a final act of love for her. We believe he wanted to accompany her out of this life and into the next one, and he did,' Margaret told the Dayton Daily News. They had a joint funeral Mass, with granddaughters carrying Ruth's casket and grandsons carrying Harold's casket. The cemetery procession stopped outside the farm house where the couple had raised their six children and enjoyed so many years of marriage.

A 21-year-old woman who was shot twice in the head and once in the abdomen by her ex-boyfriend has revealed her inspiring recovery as she learns to walk and talk again. Alyssa Dudley, from St Petersburg, Florida, was left for dead by Carlos Crompton, 39, after he shot her in her apartment on July 16 - but she fought for her life. She remains in Bayfront Medical Center, where she undergoes daily physical therapy and has now walked her first steps for the first time since the shooting. 'She makes progress every day,' her mother Diana told the Tampa Bay Times. 'Every single day.' Fighter: Alyssa Dudley, 21, gives her father, Eddie Dudley, a tired thumbs up as she takes a break before another therapy session in hospital - six weeks after she was shot in the head by an ex-boyfriend . The progress continues weeks after her Crompton forced his way into her apartment just days after she broke off their three-year relationship. The couple had met through friends and although Crompton, who had been arrested years prior on drugs charges, was considerably older than Alyssa, her family accepted him. 'We knew she was mature, independent . and very responsible,' her mother said. 'We knew she was sick of the . games guys her age would play. We wanted to give her space.' But he was unable to find steady work and Alyssa supported both of them with her job at an assisted living home. She broke up with him in July, took back her apartment keys and changed her number. Determined: Alyssa, who wears a helmet to protect her head during physical therapy sessions, has now started to walk again and can say some words. Her mother said she makes progress daily . She was at her apartment with a friend and the friend's teenage daughter when he entered the apartment and shot her three times. He then drove to his family's house where he shot at responding police officers and they returned fire, killing him. Surgeons at Bayfront Health worked throughout the night to remove the bullet and shattered bone from Alyssa's brain. Three days later, she woke up - and could only open and blink her eyes. But slowly, she began to recognize her family and move the left side of her body. But when doctors removed a tube from her throat, she was unable to speak. 'Until one morning,' he mother Diana . Dudley told the Tampa Bay Times. 'I asked her how she was doing. I . almost cried when she said, ""Good. Good"".' Before the shooting: Alyssa worked at an assisted living home and lived in her own St Petersburg apartment . Shooter: She is pictured left with ex-boyfriend Carlos Crompton, 39, who shot her twice in the head and once in the abdomen. Crompton, also pictured right, was shot dead by police when he opened fire on them . She can now speak short words and sentences, but has not asked about her ex-boyfriend. Two weeks ago, she began working with speech pathologists and physical theapists and can now move the right side of her body. Before the shooting, she had moved into her own apartment, bought her own car, worked at an assisted living home and enjoyed making personalized t-shirts for her friends. But doctors remain uncertain about how much independence she can hope for in the future. Dr. Steven Scott, a trauma expert at the . James A. Haley VA Medical Center in Tampa, told the Tampa Bay Times that every brain injury is different. 'Victims . of brain trauma do much better when they're surrounded by the love of . family,' he said. 'I believe compassion and caring will do more than . what we can do with medicine.' The family is uncertain how they'll cover . the growing costs of the care; they have learned that Medicaid only . covers 45 days of in-patient hospital bills. Family: Her mother Diana spends much of the day with Alyssa, but is concerned about mounting bills . 'Why do we have to deal with this?' Diana asked. 'Why are we faced with this problem?' She referred to care received by Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in the head in January 2011. 'I can guarantee you the services were falling at her feet,' Diana said. 'I can gurantee you she had everything she needed to help her get better. What makes my daughter less important than her?' She added that, despite having a weekly income of just $350: 'We're going to find a way. We have to be here. We want to give her a chance to live the best life possible.' The family has set up a personal bank account for donations: Diana Dudley for the benefit of Alyssa Dudley, Florida Traditions Bank, 4301 Barclay Ave., Spring Hill, FL 34609, (352) 683-9708.","Alyssa Dudley was shot twice in the head and once in the abdomen on July 16 by ex-boyfriend Carlos Crompton, 39, days after breaking up with him .

She might be famous for her lush curves, but plus-size model Robyn Lawley has hit back at the skinny shaming brigade, saying they 'miss the point'. 'People use me as a figurehead, and to me that misses the point and is blatantly offensive to thin women – my sister, for one,' the size 16 model revealed in an interview with the Guardian. 'Curves don't epitomise a woman. Saying, ""skinny is ugly"" should be no more acceptable than saying fat is. Stunning: Robyn Lawley has been featured in Italian Vogue and was the face of Boux Avenue and Ralph Lauren . Variety: Lawley says the fashion industry and media should feature a range of different body types . 'I find all this stuff a very controlling and effective way of making women obsess over their weight, instead of exploiting their more important attributes, such as intellect, strength and power. We could be getting angry about unequal pay and unequal opportunities, but we're too busy being told we're not thin enough or curvy enough. We're holding ourselves back.' 24-year-old Lawley shot to fame in 2011 when she became one of the first plus-size models to appear on the cover of Italian Vogue. Since then, the Australian has gone on to feature in campaigns for Boux Avenue and was the face of Ralph Lauren last year. Nevertheless, despite becoming something of a poster girl for proponents of 'real women', the answer is not, says Lawley, to flood the catwalks with bigger girls but to encourage diversity instead. 'Look at fashion shows. We need a range of ages and ethnicities, she says. 'There are just very thin, white, 16-year-old girls on the catwalk and that has to change.' Without more variety, she adds, girls subjected to a daily diet of ultra-skinny glossy celebrities will never feel at ease with themselves. 'I've seen the magazines, the TV shows, the celebrity articles, the same as everyone else. I'm not immune just because I'm a model. 'And I know they have a devastating effect on young girls.

Small, discreet and completely innocent looking, this tiny 'key fob phone' has been widely advertised as a 'fun item'. But they are deadly serious to the prisoners inside British jails, who have been smuggling them in to make illegal calls. The tiny handsets, which sell for £40 on various auction sites, can be easily hidden from guards, and offer inmates the chance to make calls or texts. Scroll down for video . The tiny key fob phones have been smuggled into prisons so prisoners can make secret calls . Although they do not have internet access, possession of the phone is highly prized - as seen by the 7,000 handsets and SIM cards seized in English and Welsh prisons last year, The Times reported. Various sellers boast that the phones, which often have logos on, are made with minimal metal and are largely constructed of plastic. This will be useful to buyers who want to use them in prison as they will evade the metal detectors used in prisons to hunt out contraband items. Having a mobile phone in jail is a criminal offence carrying a two-year sentence and/ or an unlimited fine. Currently there are approximately 41,000 confiscated mobile phones in storage, costing the Prison Service £20,000 per annum, according to official figures. Prisoners are risking a two-year sentence and/ or an unlimited fine to smuggle in the small phones . At present, inmates are given enough money to buy stamps and make phone calls to keep in touch with their family. Currently, prisons cannot destroy mobile phones that are confiscated, but a new Bill hopes to change that. In February, a Bill giving prisons new powers to destroy or dispose of unauthorised property found in the possession of prisoners received Royal Assent. The Prisons (Property) Bill, backed by the Ministry of Justice, will allow Governors to destroy, recycle, sell or donate illicit mobile phones and other unauthorised items. Any proceeds will go to charities or other suitable organisations. Prisons Minister Jeremy Wright said: 'We are determined to address the problems caused by mobile phones and contraband in prisons - it is totally unacceptable that prisons have had to pay for storing these items after confiscation. 'This Bill will give new powers to prison authorities so that they can dispose of mobile phones and unauthorised property in an appropriate and cost-effective way.' The new powers will apply to items found in the possession of a prisoner or an escort vehicle. The Private Members Bill has been brought forward by Stuart Andrew MP in the House of Commons and Lord Ramsbotham in the House of Lords. A Prison Service spokesperson said: 'The Government is clamping down on mobile phones in prison and our rigorous security measures mean even the smallest mobiles can be detected and kept out of prison. 'A range of techniques - including Body Orifice Security Scanners and high sensitivity metal detectors - has seen the number of recorded seizures increase. 'We're now working closely with the Serious Organised Crime Agency and Trading Standards to remove these small mobiles from sale in the UK, as well as legislating to block phone signals in prisons.'","The tiny handsets, which sell for £40, can be easily hidden from guards .

A shocked friend told staff at a caravan and camping park east of Darwin that the man and a friend jumped into the crocodile-infested Mary River for a swim on Saturday (local time), ignoring all warnings. The friend then watched helplessly as a huge crocodile grabbed hold of the man and pulled him under. Lethal: Saltwater crocodiles pull their victims to the riverbed and roll them around until they drown, before partially eating them - and storing the rest for later . The victim has not been seen since. Northern Watch Commander Peter Lindfield . said water police were on the scene searching for the missing man with . the help of Parks and Wildlife rangers in the hope that he might have been able to break free from the crocodile's jaws and swim to the river bank. Miss Erin Baynard, who works at the Mary River Wilderness Retreat and Caravan Park, said the friend reported the incident around 4pm. She said the two men went . swimming somewhere between the accommodation block and the nearby . Arnhem Highway bridge but she was unsure exactly where, and that they would have been well aware of the dangers of venturing into the water. 'The friend came back in deep shock and it was obvious just by looking at him that something bad had happened,' she said. 'He was saying over and over that a crocodile had taken his friend. Idyllic: The Mary River, where the attack took place, is a popular destination for campers east of Darwin . 'The tragedy here is that everybody knows that the river is dangerous - there are more crocs in it than any other river in the Northern Territory. 'We tell everybody not to go into the water because of the lurking danger.' A few small groups of campers remained by the river. 'There's nothing much I can say, it's just a tragedy,' one of the campers said. The saltwater crocodiles of the .

An attention seeking zebra showed how to get himself noticed when he bared his full set of teeth to get a treat from a passing visitor. The savvy animal was sharing an enclosure with a group of giraffes in a zoo in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, when he noticed a visitor handing out carrots. Not one to miss a snack, or a photo opportunity, he quickly strolled over to Davin Gegolick and his family, flashing his rotting teeth to show just how hungry he was. Baring it all: The hungry zebra approached Mr Gegolick when he realised he was handing out carrots . Mr Gegolick from Alberta, Canada, was visiting Mismaloya Zoo while on holiday with his family in Mexico. He said: 'The place was amazing, like no zoo I've ever visited before. It's very popular with tourists. 'The giraffes were in the same enclosure as the zebra, who is the only one at the zoo, and although the enclosure walls were barely tall enough to enclose them, they had no intentions of escaping. 'With just a few pesos, we purchased some treats to feed the animals and started to feed them to a giraffe.' Mr Gegolick had to get up close and personal with the animal in order to capture his rotting teeth in all their glory . Just as he started feeding the giraffes, Mr Gegolick noticed the approaching zebra who wanted a piece of the action. 'He was just hungry. 'The zebra was one of the friendliest animals in the entire zoo, I couldn't stop laughing at him as his mouth and teeth got closer and closer to my camera. Baring it all: The hungry zebra approached Mr Gegolick when he realised he was handing out carrots . 'It was almost impossible to not spare him a carrot while I snapped the hungry beast. 'Luckily he didn't try and go for my camera, the carrots were more than enough for him!' Mr Gegolick, 25, took out his camera as soon as he saw the animal approaching. 'To get the best picture, I was forced to get really close to the zebra's mouth. 'I was probably only a few feet away from him and I was zoomed to 75mm on my camera so I luckily didn't have to get any closer!' Mr Gegolick stayed at the enclosure for a few minutes before leaving, much to the disappointment of his new friend. 'He was a very happy chap, the only movement he made towards us was following us with his mouth open, begging for more carrots. 'When we walked away, he followed us all the way to the end of his enclosure, to try and get some more treats.'","Hungry animal flashed his teeth to show just how hungry he was .

Teenage drivers who listen to rock or rap music are more likely to drive badly or be involved in a crash, a study found. Young motorists made a greater number of errors and miscalculations while driving with their aggressive, fast-paced and loud music on, according to research from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel. But when soothing tunes were played motoring behaviour actually improved, the survey discovered. Men in particular made more frequent and serious mistakes listening to their favourite tunes than their less aggressive, female counterparts, the researchers noted. Risk: Teens who listen to loud, aggressive music while behind the wheel are more likely to be involved in a crash or drive badly, a study found (File photo) The BGU study evaluated 85 young novice drivers accompanied by a researcher/driving instructor. Each driver took six challenging 40-minute trips; two with music from their own playlists; two with background music designed to increase driver safety (easy listening, soft rock, light jazz), and two additional trips without any music. The study was conducted by BGU Director of Music Science Research Warren Brodsky and researcher Zack Slor to assess distraction by measuring driver deficiencies (miscalculation, inaccuracy, aggressiveness, and violations) as well as decreased vehicle performance. When the teen drivers listened to their preferred music, virtually all (98 percent) demonstrated an average of three deficient driving behaviors in at least one of the trips. Dangers: Young men are particularly susceptible to seeing their driving standards deteriorate if they listen to their preferred music. (Picture posed by model) Nearly a third of those (32 percent) required a a sudden verbal warning or command for action, and 20 percent needed an assisted steering or braking maneuver to prevent an imminent accident. These errors included speeding, tailgating, careless lane switching, passing vehicles and one-handed driving. Without listening to any music, 92 percent made errors. However, when driving with an alternative music background designed by Brodsky and Israeli music composer Micha Kisner, deficient driving behaviors decreased by 20 percent. 'Most drivers worldwide prefer to listen to music in a car and those between ages 16 to 30 choose driving to pop, rock, dance, hip-hop and rap,' Brodsky explains. 'Young drivers also tend to play this highly energetic, fast-paced music very loudly - approximately 120 to 130 decibels.' 'Drivers in general are not aware that as they get drawn-in by a song, they move from an extra-personal space involving driving tasks, to a more personal space of active music listening.' The Israel National Road Safety Authority funded the study which will be published in the October issue of Accident Analysis and Prevention.","Young men are particularly prone to errors when listening to preferred music .

Two neurosurgeons at the University of California, Davis have stepped down from their positions after intentionally infecting three brain-cancer patients with a bowel bacteria they thought would save their lives. While one patient lived a year after the treatment, the other two died soon after the procedure prompting a university investigation that concluded that Dr J Paul Muizelaar and Dr Rudolph J Schrot had violated the school's code of conduct. The officials said they should have obtained permission from both the school and the Food and Drug Administration before conducting the experimental procedure. Out of the job: Dr J Paul Muizelaar, left, and Dr Rudolph J Schrot, right, both stepped down from their positions as neurologists at the University of California, Davis after an investigation found they didn't get the right permission to conduct an experimental procedure . The three patients, two middle-aged women and a man, each had been diagnosed with glioblastoma, a highly malignant brain tumor. The doctors hoped that injecting the patients with live bowel bacteria would stimulate their immune systems and prolong their lives. The first patient died a little more than a month after the treatment, but the second lived for more than a year, giving the doctors hope that the treatment was working. Patients: The doctors were treating three brain-cancer patients with severely malignant tumors. One patient lived a year after the procedure but the other two died within just weeks . When the third patient developed sepsis and died within two weeks, however, the university launched an investigation. After The Sacramento Bee reported on the treatments in July 2012, a second investigation was launched and resulted in the resignations. University investigators concluded that Dr Muizelaar and Dr Schrot 'deliberately circumvented' internal policies, 'defied directives' from top leaders and sidestepped federal regulations. 'Investigators I appointed heard from some witnesses that there is perception that compliance with university policies and external regulatory requirements is not a universally held value,' said Ralph J. Hexter, the school’s provost and executive vice chancellor. Blamed: Former dean of the School of Medicine, Dr Claire Pomeroy, also stepped down following criticism of the neurologists' procedure . Dr Claire Pomeroy, who was dean of the university’s School of Medicine, resigned last June as a result of the investigation. Dr Muizelaar, who headed the university’s neurosurgery department, also left in June. Schrot plans to leave at the end of the month. Dr Muizelaar was the 33rd highest paid employee in the University of California system last year, making $907,000. Dr Schrot was also highly paid, with a $512,000 salary. The doctors told the Bee they weren’t trying to do unapproved research or create a treatment they could profit from. They said they only wanted to give their patients a last-ditch chance at survival, Dr Muizelaar adding that the treatment had been suggested by a colleague. 'I was simply thinking that I could help patients,' Dr Muizelaar said. 'My whole medical practice is guided by actually only one principle, namely: What would I do for my mother, my son, myself?' He partially blames university politics for the criticism surrounding the procedure. He says that there have been strained relations between the university and the School of Medicine since the medical school has tripled it's funding in recent years. Ousting top university doctors like Muizelaar and Schrot is a way that university Chancellor Linda Katehi can establish more authority over the medical school. Both Dr Muizelaar and Dr Schrot plan to continue to work in medicine. 66-year-old Dr Muizelaar said he has been approached by other academic institutions who have said: 'Hey,we need you, we want somebody like you on our faculty.' Politics at play: Dr Muizelaar blames university politics saying the investigation was a way for the university chancellor to assert more power over the School of Medicine .","Dr J Paul Muizelaar and Dr Rudolph J Schrot have stepped down from their positions as neurologists at the University of California, Davis .

Ousted Chinese politician Bo Xilai withdraw a confession of bribery while prosecutors alleged he used his wife and son to help collect more than $4 million in illicit funds, as his trial got underway today China's biggest political scandal in decades. Court officials released frequent microblog updates on the testimony in an unusual display of openness for a major political trial, suggesting ruling Communist Party officials were confident of minimizing damage from a scandal that exposed a murder and high-level infighting among China's elite. Bo denied taking payments from Tang Xiaolin, the general manager of an international development corporation in the northeastern city of Dalian, where Bo once held key posts, though he said he had previously admitted to party investigators that he had done so. Scroll down for video . Denial: Chinese politician Bo Xilai denied bribery when he appeared in court this morning . 'The matter of me taking money on three occasions, as Tang Xiaolin said, does not exist,' Bo said. 'During the time I was being investigated by the Central Disciplinary Commission, I once admitted to this matter against my will. 'However, at the time, I had absolutely no knowledge of the nature of the matter, my mind was a total blank. 'I hope the judge will reasonably and fairly judge, and judge this according to the laws of our country.' Bo was quoted as saying in one of the Sina Weibo posts by the Jinan Intermediate People's Court. Once the powerful party boss in the megacity of Chongqing, the charismatic Bo became the most senior leader to fall from power in years after revelations emerged early last year that his wife had killed a British businessman, making the Bo family an international diplomatic liability for the Chinese leadership. Escort: The former Communist Party was led into court by two police officers . The charges against him include abuse of power in covering up that murder, as well as bribery and embezzlement. The accusations appear carefully calibrated to lay blame on the self-serving actions of Bo and his family and provide enough culpability to bury his political career, while avoiding allegations that could expose the party's factional squabbling or show the impunity with which top Chinese officials operate before they fall from favor. Prosecutors gave new details of the allegations against Bo and his family, including accusations that Bo used both his wife, Gu Kailai, and his son, Bo Guagua, as intermediaries in accepting more than $3 million in Dalian. They also alleged that Bo instructed an underling to keep quiet a payment to the city of $800,000, and that Bo diverted it into personal funds with the help of his wife, according to the Jinan court updates. Security: Bo was led into court amid tight security at the opening of his trial . Bo's removal had marked China's biggest upheaval in the leadership since the violent suppression of the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests in 1989. Bo's revival of the symbolism of Mao Zedong's radical era had unnerved China's previous leadership, although current leader Xi Jinping, installed last fall, has appeared keen to adopt his own brand of Mao-like tactics. Earlier Thursday, Bo entered the courthouse in a convoy under police escort. Though kept far away from the media, some of Bo's supporters gathered outside a security perimeter around the court venue, intermittently yelling out 'he served the people!' and 'he was a good cadre!' The scandal was triggered last year when Bo's police chief, a top aide, fled to a US consulate in a neighboring city, an event that embarrassed the party's leadership ahead of a key political transition. It would later emerge that the police chief had evidence of the Briton's murder in late 2011. A guilty verdict against Bo is all but assured, because the outcomes of high-profile political trials in China are usually decided by backroom negotiations by politicians and handed down by the court. Bo's wife confessed to killing Neil Heywood and was handed a suspended death sentence last year that will likely be commuted to life imprisonment.","Former politician Bo Xilai began withdraws a confession of bribery .

Eleven women are suing a Washington state police department over claims that they were inappropriately filmed as they undressed and used a jail cell toilet. Seattle attorney James Egan, who has filed the lawsuit against Puyallup police department, on behalf on the eleven women and one man, said: 'This is pervy, a peepshop ... there is no excuse.' His clients claim that when they were booked for DUI, which normally does not require changing into jail clothes, they were directed to change in a jail cell that had a wall-mounted security camera. Caught on camera: A woman is filmed getting undressed in a police cell . Mr Egan first noticed the practice two years ago, while working on a case for two women arrested for DUI, who were told to strip even though they were about to be booked, according to King 5 News. Concerned by what he saw, he made a public request for more jail footage to see if a pattern emerged. 'It appeared from my limited review that it was happening to women - attractive women, in particular,' he told King 5. One of the alleged victims, who has asked not to be identified, said: 'I thought it was maybe for seeing if we have contraband or something but we are already patted down. So then, why would there be a camera still?' In another case, a jailer allegedly . asked one of the women who had changed into the jail uniform to go back . into the cell and remove her underwear, saying it was jail protocol, Mr . Egan told the News Tribune. 'What possible security reason could they have … she’s going to hang . herself with her panties?' he said, adding that she was due to be released. However, Captain Scott Engle, of Puyallup Police Department, said it was a needed protocol to protect officers and inmates. 'No excuse': Attorney James Egan claims filming in cells is like 'a peep show' 'People who come into the corrections environment commonly hide narcotics, contraband, weapons or other miscellaneous things on their body or in their clothing,' he said. A spokesman for Puyallup told King 5 News video surveillance was standard in holding cells, as was stripping and changing into jail clothes. They added there was no evidence of exploitation by the police. 'We see no wrongdoing on the part of anyone at the jail,' Captain Engle said. Many of the alleged victims had no idea they had been filmed until they were contacted by Mr Egan. One recalled feeling sick as she watched the footage for the first time, adding: 'I [didn't] believe my own eye. It's me. I felt sick to the stomach.' The alleged victims claim the recordings, which have to be kept by the police department under state laws for several years, are criminal voyeurism. One woman said she first realized she had been filmed when a jailer allegedly commented on the way she had used the toilet. 'I felt even more violated because I knew they were watching,' she said. Architect Kenneth Burns, who has designed 40 jail facilities, said: 'You do have lots of cameras, you do watch a lot of things but you cannot watch anywhere where someone is using the shower, toilet facility or a changing area.' Allegations: Puyallup police department is being sued by 11 women and a man . A city attorney said the cameras were needed in case an inmate claimed they had been injured in the jail. Captain Engle added the cameras were in plain sight and signs on doors state video surveillance is used. He told the News Tribune no one had complained about the practice before Mr Egan got involved and added: 'All arrestes booked into the Puyallup City Jail are treated the exact same way.'","12 claimants sue after being recorded by jail cell cameras .

The mother of 21-year-old killer took the stand today and blamed her ex-husband for her son's troubled childhood that she claims led him to murder, telling Michael Bargo, Sr, 'It's your fault.' Tracey O'Brien, 38, said her son, Michael Bargo, Jr, who was found guilty of masterminding the killing of 15-year-old Seath Jackson in 2011, had grown up with an alcoholic father with an explosive temper. His lawyers are trying to avoid the death penalty by arguing that Michael Bargo, Jr suffered abuse at the hands of his mother and was traumatized by his parents' divorce. Devastated: A court heard testimony from convicted murderer Michael Bargo's mother Tracey O'Brien today as he faces the death penalty in his sentencing hearing . Tracey O'Brien, 38, wept throughout . her testimony as the prosecutor questioned her about Michael Bargo, Jr's . childhood and her marriage to his father, Michael Bargo, Sr. The devastated mother was summonsed to the Florida court from her home in Michigan to testify at her son's sentencing hearing. O'Brien . reportedly did not testify at her son's murder trial because, according . to testimony from Bargo, Sr, her son didn't want her there. She . told the court that the hearing was the first time she'd seen her son . in four years and detailed her unhappy marriage with Bargo, Sr, who she . described as an abusive alcoholic who regularly lashed out in anger. 'He would throw . dinner if it wasn't warm, or I said something wrong or we got into an . argument, he would start throwing things,' she said. Convicted killer: Michael Bargo was convicted in less than three hours for his part in the 2011 murder of Seath Jackson . Disturbing: Seath Tyler Jackson was brutally murdered and his body burned in a pit. His remains were then shovelled into paint cans and thrown in a dumpster . As his son grew older, Bargo, Sr . would encourage the boy to demean and disrespect his mother. She . recalled arriving home to find that her son had scrawled 'Tracey is a . whore' on the front driveway of their house. When . Bargo, Jr was 14 his father moved to Florida. During that time, the . teen was diagnosed with ADD but his father would encourage him not to . take his prescription Ritalin. Bargo, . Jr would explode in fits of uncontrollable rage that O'Brien couldn't . control, having to call the police a number of times, she told the . court. Bargo, Sr . began to call Social Services in an effort to discredit O'Brien as a . parent and gain custody of his son. She testified that . Bargo, Sr put through so many false calls about her, he was . eventually told that if he called again he would be charged for filing . a false report. The father owed more than $20,000 in child support for Bargo, Jr, which O'Brien never received. Eventually, when Bargo, Jr was 16, he went to live with his father in Florida. Callous crime: Michael Bargo (left), and Charlie Ely (right) were both convicted for Seath Jackson's murder . Associates: Justin Soto (left) was convicted and sentenced to life in prison, while James Young Havens III, was eventually found not to have been involved in the crime .

Tracey O'Brien told the court that until she found out about the horrific crime, she had been under the impression that her son was thriving in Florida. His father would lie to O'Brien, telling her everything was fine and that Bargo, Jr was doing well at school when in fact the teen had dropped out. Bargo, .

Bernice King, the daughter of Reverend Martin Luther King, normally shies from the national spotlight but she is now stepping directly into with several revealing interviews as part of the 50th anniversary of her father’s I Have a Dream speech. Born mere months after her trailblazing father gave the iconic address in Washington, DC in August 1963, the typically reserved younger Reverend King is now cultivating an image that is more than the handful of photos from the civil rights era that so many Americans associate her with. As she celebrates her father’s achievements in front of the public, King is also showing glimpses of herself rarely seen before and perhaps trying to step out from under the huge shadow undoubtedly cast by her famous father’s legacy. Honor: Bernice King has stepped out of her father's shadow and into the national spotlight in recent weeks. Here, she helps commemorate her father's legendary 1963 I Have a Dream Speech . Struggle: Bernice King, the youngest of MLK's children is seen here in 1964. She was just 5 at the time of her father's death and has struggled with her place in his legacy ever since . Thousands swarmed the spot near the Lincoln Memorial Saturday to honor the anniversary of King's speech and the world changing orator's adult daughter was among them. The 50-year-old reverend also recently sat for a CNN interview in which she attempted to dispel what, if any, notions the public has of her. ‘People just don't know me, period,’ she told CNN. As for her not showing enough of herself so that people might begin to know her, some of King’s family members say that not quite so easy. Bernice King, seen here in November, has shied away from national attention for much of her life. Now as she honors her father's achievements, the orator, lawyer and reverend has a chance to showcase her own . Shattered: Martin Luther King Jr. pushes Bernice on a glider swing in their backyard in 1964. King's assassination was one among a number of tragedies that have befallen the family over the years . ‘If you're out among the people, and . everybody thinks you belong to them and you've never met them, you, too, . would walk a little quieter,’ said her cousin, the Reverend Alveda . King. For . a lot of Americans, Bernice is the sad little girl with pigtails in a . dress at her father’s funeral after his 1968 assassination. She was just five at the time. She describes the moment as a . wrenching and irrevocably memorable one. And since the sad day in . American history was caught on camera, many have never stopped seeing . King as that little girl. Some of those who know her as an adult don’t all like what they’ve seen. Indelible: This image from King's 1968 funeral is what stands out in the minds of most who in reference to the name Bernice King . Meanwhile, others associate the youngest King with a 2004 march she held against same-sex marriage . Squabbles between her and her siblings have made national news ahead of her achievements as a reverend, lawyer, and orator. Critics say her family has tarnished the King name by trying to make money of Martin Luther King’s legacy. And . Bernice King was roundly criticized for leading a march against . same-sex marriage in 2004.

A 60-year-old woman has been fielding calls for an escort named 'Julia' since her phone number was wrongly listed on online classifieds site Backpage.com. Nancy Caldwell is a school secretary at Thonotosassa Elementary School who began receiving odd phone calls and text messages at all times of the night and day. At first, she thought they were just wrong numbers, but when the calls didn't abate in late July, she questioned one of the men about how he got her phone number. Bad listing: Nancy Caldwell has been getting phone calls off the hook from men looking for a woman named 'Julia' According to the Tampa Bay Times, the man on the other end responded, 'Uh, you're on Backpage.' After weeks of suggestive messages and phone calls for the very popular Julia, Caldwell finally had an answer. Backpage.com is the second-largest online listings site after Craigslist but it's best known for its adult services listings and has come under fire recently for facilitating human trafficking and child prostitution. Caldwell told the Tampa Bay Times that when she called T-Mobile, her service provider, they told her she needed a police report to change her phone number. 'It's very disruptive, but it's very disturbing,' Caldwell said. Most of the calls appeared to be coming from the Salt Lake City, Utah area. According to the Tampa Bay Times, an early August search for 'Julia' in the escorts section of Backpage's Utah site in July came up with one result. 'I'm only in town for a short amount of time and I'm looking for someone to spend it with,' Julia's ad read. Advertised services: The current ad for 'Julia' whose number is also the contact for 'Kat' and listed on many Utah escort sites . 'Like no other woman you have met before... WARNING you may become ADDICTED! Lol' The Times reports that this ad was accompanied by images of 'Julia' that were actually several different women, including the British soap actress Helen Flanagan. On August 10, the ad was finally updated and a single digit was changed, presumably to the correct number for men seeking the real 'Julia' - whoever that is. 'Julia' has updated her pictures so that they're all of the same woman. According to her ad, she posts '100% REAL PICS!!!' and is '100% INDEPENDENT and ALWAYS AVAILABLE!!!' but a web search of the newly-corrected phone number comes up with a raft of escort sites. The profile for a woman named 'Kat' also comes up, who uses the same photographs of several different women as the original Backpage.com ad posted by 'Julia'. When the Tampa Bay Times called the listed number, a Google Voice account that forwards callers to an online voicemail box was reached. Whoever received the message did not respond. According to Backpage's lawyer, people in Caldwell's situation can report the problem to the site, which will attempt to remove any ads with the number in them  - but Backpage may not get them all. As for Caldwell herself, the calls have declined but she is still receiving calls from Salt Lake City. 'I guess this poor Julia gal isn't getting any business,' she told the Tampa Bay Times.","School secretary Nancy Caldwell's number has been listed on an online escort ad .

A treasure hunter has unearthed a valuable silver ring that provides new evidence for the spread of early Christianity in Britain before St Augustine arrived on an official mission in 597AD. The ring, found by an anonymous treasure hunter in Swaffham, Norfolk, is inscribed with words commonly found on converts' rings. Experts have dated the ring between 312 and 410AD, long before Augustine's official mission to convert the Britons in 597AD. A treasure-hunter unearthed this valuable silver ring which gives more evidence for early Christians in Britain. It bears a Latin inscription saying 'Antonius, may you live in God', a phrase commonly found on the rings of Roman converts . The ring, that was found using a metal detector to hunt for . precious artefacts, adds further weight to an increasing body of evidence that more Christians existed in Roman Britain than has been traditionally thought. It bears a Latin inscription saying 'Antonius, may you live in God', a phrase commonly found on the rings of Roman converts. The finder, who has not been identified, stumbled upon the ring with his metal detector near Swaffham, Norfolk in February. Only the top disc remains of the signet ring, which was declared treasure by an inquest in King's Lynn on yesterday on 19 August. Finds officer Adrian Marsden, at Norwich Castle Museum, said: 'The disc that would have been set into the bezel from a signet ring constitutes important evidence for Christianity in late Roman Norfolk.' Experts have dated the ring between 312 and 410AD, long before Augustine's official mission to convert the Britons in 597AD. The missionary monk (pictured, left, on a manuscript) is said to be buried in Canterbury (right) The inquest also declared a Viking silver ingot and four Iron Age coins as treasure. Historians have come to believe that Christianity arrived long before the arrival of Augustine and could have reached our island in the first century AD. It is thought that Roman traders arriving in Britain spread stories about Jesus alongside other tales of Pagan deities. However, Augustine, who was sent from the Pope in Rome to visit King Aethelbert of Kent, is credited with sowing the seed of the religion in Britain. Augustine of Canterbury was a Benedictine monk who became the first Archbishop of Canterbury in the year 597. He is considered the 'Apostle to the English' and a founder of the English Church. Augustine was the prior of a monastery in Rome when Pope Gregory the Great chose him in 595 to lead a mission, usually known as the Gregorian mission, to Britain to Christianize King Aethelbert and his Kingdom of Kent from their native Anglo-Saxon paganism. Kent was probably chosen because the king had married a Christian princess, Bertha, daughter of Charibert I the King of Paris. In 597 Augustine landed on the Isle of Thanet and proceeded to Aethelbert's main town of Canterbury. King Æthelberht converted to Christianity and allowed the missionaries to preach freely, giving them land to found a monastery outside the city walls. Augustine was consecrated as a bishop and converted many of the king's subjects. Pope Gregory sent more missionaries in 601, along with encouraging letters and gifts for the churches. Roman bishops were established at London and Rochester in 604, and a school was founded to train Anglo-Saxon priests and missionaries. The archbishop probably died in 604 and was soon revered as a saint.","Ring dates back between 312 and 410 AD was found near Swaffham in Norfolk by an anonymous person using a metal detector .

It hardly looks like the house of a wealthy woman, but this is the first glimpse of the meagre council property is where Joan Edwards, the woman who left more than £500,000 to the government in her will, lived. The money was controversially accepted by both the Tories and Lib Dems, but handed over to the Treasury yesterday after a furious row emerged over their acceptance of the money. Home sweet home: Joan Edwards pictured outside her Bristol council home in 1931 the former nurse left her fortune to the Government to spend 'as they may think fit.' But despite her wealth Miss Edwards, 90, lived in the modest council home in Bristol where she was born and raised. Friends say she still washed in a tin bath and lived mainly off vegetables she grew in a small plot in the garden. Local people dubbed her ‘the last Victorian’ because she lived such a strict and pious life - wearing a plain outfit and a hat with a feather in. She would scold noisy children playing outside her home - which she once had the chance to buy for £2,000 but declined the council’s offer. Modest: The ordinary semi-detached property which Miss Edwards lived in all her life, under the right to buy the scheme she was offered the chance to buy it for just £2,000 but refused . Frugal: Inside the home where Joan Edwards lived all her life, sparsely furnished and with bare floorboards . Joan also would not allow Bristol City Council to put in new windows or kitchen preferring to keep things the way she had always known them. The new occupants, Louise and Jason Jones, said the local authority had to revamp the property before they could move in last March. Mrs Jones said: 'We have heard about her. She still had all the cladding in the bedroom and the wooden beams. 'The council said she refused to allow them to do the kitchen, put central heating in or touch the windows.' Neighbour Patrick Dunleavy, 71, said walking into the former nurse’s home was like stepping back in time. The last Victorian: Miss Edwards pictured shortly before her death and, right, as a child in 1931, was well known amongst her neighbours for strict and pious lifestyle . He said: 'I used to call her the last Victorian. She was very strict. There would be kids playing in the street and she would come out and tell them off. 'She would also dress in a very old fashioned way with laced up boots and a hat with a feather in it. She certainly wasn’t trendy.' Mr Dunleavy, who lives opposite and had known Miss Edwards for 40 years, added: 'Walking into her house was like going back in time. 'She had no central heating, instead using an old gas stove and boiler. In her bathroom there was a big standalone cast iron bath. 'She had a small electric heater in her bedroom and a slightly bigger one in the lounge, where there was also a Welsh dresser. That was about it. 'It seemed like the house had hardly been touched since the day it was first built. Simple taste: Miss Edwards refused to have central heating and double glazing installed in her home, preferring to use small electric heaters and a tin bath . 'She must have used coal as well, because she asked me one day if I knew anybody who would want it. 'She had a vegetable patch in the garden that I would help with, although she didn’t use that as much as she got older. 'Considering how much money she had you, would have thought she could have lived more comfortably.' Even though the council had revamped the house which she lived in since 1931, Miss Edwards' home still has some of the original fittings including wooden beams and floorboards. Neighbours described her as a 'churchgoing and highly intelligent' lady who turned down the chance to buy her £160,000 house for just £2,000 under the right-to-buy scheme. Miss Edwards estate has been at the centre of a political storm when instead of spending the money on the Health Service, schools or to ease the national debt, the Coalition shared the £519,999 between them as a party donation. Stunned: Neighbours Sarah Brennan, 44, and Lucy Sanders, 44, were shocked to discover how much Miss Edwards was worth after witnessing the frugal way she lived. With bare floors and a modest decor her home was a time capsule to years gone by and revealed nothing of the £500,000 stash of cash she left to the Government when she died . Into the time warp: Miss Edwards' neigbours said walking through her door was like stepping back in time . But after a backlash, leaders handed the cash over to the treasury meaning it will go back into the public purse rather than fund the parties. Her friend, Joan Seville, 85, said she thought Miss Edwards had been a Conservative, and had made her money buying and selling shares. When she wrote her will in 2001, Labour were in power, having just won their second term in a landslide victory. Labour Bristol East MP Kerry McCarthy criticised those who allowed the donation to be accepted in teh first place saying she believes they were 'blinded' by greed. She said: 'It seems to me utterly inconceivable that a bequest to ""the Government of the day"" could be interpreted as a donation to the Tories and Lib Dems to spend on electioneering. 'I want to know what questions were asked when the money came in, and whether the parties were involved in any discussions with the executors beforehand as to how the money was to be split - a conversation that surely should have rung alarm bells. 'I can only assume that greed blinded them to the questions that should have been asked. 'Joan was obviously a very private person and would no doubt be horrified by all this attention, but now that her legacy is in the public domain, I think that rather than it just being swallowed up in the Treasury coffers, it would be a decent gesture to use at least part of her legacy to fund something close to her heart, such as the excellent new birth centre down the road at Cossham hospital, training for nurses at nearby UWE or replacing some of the 681 nurses that North Bristol trust has lost since 2010.'","Former nurse Joan Edwards was dubbed 'the last Victorian' by neighbours .

"Original Dove ad campaign features an FBI-trained forensic artist who sketches women, while the spoof video targets men .

Now a spoof video by New Feelings Time with the tagline 'Men: You're Less Beautiful Than You Think' is also becoming an Internet sensation. Dove's Real Beauty Sketches . campaign hired an FBI forensic artist to sketch women based on their . own descriptions of themselves - without ever seeing them - then create a . second drawing based on stranger's description. While the women in the original video focused on their flaws when describing themselves to the sketch artist, the men view themselves as movie star handsome. Scroll down for videos . Spoof sketches: The men re-enacted the Dove ad almost frame-by-frame, but had a much better opinion of their looks than the women in the original video . Reaction shot: One man was shocked after he described himself as George Clooney (left) while the women interviewed had a very different take (right) One man says he's a 'white Denzel Washington', while the woman's description of him said he 'looked like a lawn gnome'. The spoof video re-creates the original . almost frame-by-frame, using a bearded 'forensic artist', a very similar . loft studio and even the same music. Like the women, the men explain . that they showed up in a strange location and a man started drawing . them. Self confident: The men focused on their positive features, while the women they were told to get close to seemed to see many more flaws . Altered images: One man sees Brad Pitt (left) when he looks in the mirror, but strangers saw someone who looked very different (right) Once the portraits were hung side-by-side, the women in the original ad were shocked to see that the sketches created on the stranger's description of them were much more attractive. For the men, it was exactly the opposite. They see the positives like 'beautiful teeth'. 'People . say that they're an abyss because they just don't end,' one man says of his eyes, while another believes that 'the older I've gotten the more . stunning I've gotten.' Spot the difference: One man (left) is . shocked when he sees the difference in his description (center) of . himself and a stranger's view (right) Asked to name his 'most prominent feature', yet another man proudly lists 'my bulge'. The men were told to chat with female strangers - who had a very different view. 'Overall I would say that he really looked like lawn gnome,' one woman said, while another admitted 'he looked like he smelled really bad, and he did.' The men loved their eyes, but the women were less complimentary. One said 'his eyes kind of bugged out when he talked,' another called the guy's eyes 'rapey' and a third explained 'I can't remember if he had eyebrows.' To sum up, the final female questioned . compared her match to a Lord of the Rings character, saying he looked . like he walked 'fresh out of Mordor'. During the portrait reveal, the women in the original ad were shocked to discover how much more beautiful they appeared to strangers - one even teared up in happiness. The men were crying for different reasons. After being shown a side-by-side of his Edward Norton-look-alike with a bloated, nerdy profile, one man said 'he looks like a movie star, and the other one looks like he'll probably die soon.' 'I didn't realize that two opinions could be so vastly different,' said a guy who described himself as Brad Pitt, after discovering that the girls saw the Unibomber. 'That is not me,' said the man at the end, 'and I refuse to believe it.'","Original Dove ad campaign features an FBI-trained forensic artist who sketches women, while the spoof video targets men .

Neanderthals were more culturally complex than previously thought, according to scientists who have studied prehistoric handaxes. The design of handaxes, the multipurpose tool used by Neanderthals primarily to prepare food, were passed down the generations and demonstrate social learning in different groups living in what is now modern Europe. Two cultural traditions existed among Neanderthals living in northern Europe between 115,000 to 35,000 years ago, the researchers said. Dr Karen Ruebens from the Centre for the Archaeology of Human Origins examined the design of 1,300 stone tools (pictured) originating from 80 Neanderthal sites in five European countries; France, Germany, Belgium, Britain and the Netherlands . Dr Karen Ruebens from the Centre for the Archaeology of Human Origins at the University of Southampton examined the design of 1,300 stone tools originating . from 80 Neanderthal sites in five European countries; France, Germany, . Belgium, Britain and the Netherlands. Dr  Ruebens’ investigations uncovered new . evidence that two separate handaxe traditions or designs existed; one . in a region now spanning south-western France and Britain and the other in . Germany and further to the East. She also found an area covering modern day Belgium and the Netherlands that demonstrates a transition between the two. She told MailOnline the handaxes were . used for similar functions - to butcher animals, woodworking and . hideworking - in both regions she studied and described them as . 'multifunctional tools'. A map of the area where the hand axe cultures were spread out during the Middle Pleistocene. The study found the design of handaxes was passed down generations in different groups living in what is now modern Europe . Dr Ruebens said: 'In Germany and France there appears to be . two separate handaxe traditions, with clear boundaries, indicating . completely separate, independent developments. 'The transition zone in Belgium and . Northern France indicates contact between the different groups of . Neanderthals, which is generally difficult to identify but has been much . talked about, especially in relation to later contacts with groups of . modern humans.' Dr Reubens said the handaxes were used for similar functions in both regions she studied and described them as 'multifunctional tools' 'This area can be seen as a melting pot of . ideas where mobile groups of Neanderthals, both from the eastern and . western tradition, would pass by – influencing each other’s designs and . leaving behind a more varied record of bifacial tools.' The University of Southampton research . has revealed Neanderthals in the western region made symmetrical, . triangular and heart-shaped handaxes, while during the same time period, . in the eastern region, they produced asymmetrically shaped bifacial . knives. Dr Ruebens said: 'Distinct ways of making a handaxe were . passed on from generation to generation and for long enough to become . visible in the archaeological record. 'This indicates a strong mechanism of . social learning within these two groups and says something about the . stability and connectivity of the Neanderthal populations. 'Making . stone tools was not merely an opportunistic task. A lot of time, effort . and tradition were invested and these tools carry a certain amount of . socio-cultural information, which does not contribute directly to their . function.' Dr Reubens told MailOnline that microscopic usage analysis showed traces of what the tools were used for. Archaeologists believe they were used for three primary activities: . The study also said other factors previously thought to have determined the shape of handaxes, including the raw materials available to . Neanderthals, the function of their sites or the repeated reuse and . sharpening of tools, didn’t have an impact. She told MailOnline the 'cultural pattern overrides the other factors'. Dr . Reubens said: 'There was a habit to make the handaxes in a certain way . [in distinct groups] that was passed down generation to generation. 'It was a conscious decision to make them [the tools] in a certain way.' She also said that there was 'no link' between the different shaped tools being used for different tasks. The various shaped handaxes are all thought to be multipurpose prehistoric tools. Dr Reubens' research, which was published in the Journal of Human Evolution, adds to an emerging archaeological perspective on Neanderthal regionality, which is a concept also identified in studies of their skeletal and genetic features.","The design of handaxes demonstrate social learning in different Neanderthal groups living in what is now modern Europe .

Drug binge: Sophie Lee Turley who says she introduced Melissa Reid to drug gang that made her friend a mule . A third girl who says she almost became ensnared in the Ibiza cocaine smuggling plot has been questioned by British police. Sophie Lee Turley says that after she and Melissa Reid were taken on a four-day drug binge by a man in Ibiza, she was targeted by the same gang that is said to have ensnared Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly. She says she escaped before being forced to carry drugs. ‘I went and hid for a few days as I was terrified,’ she said. Miss Turley, a friend of Reid, is lying low in her home city of Nottingham, having been warned she had 24 hours to flee Ibiza. She told The Mail on Sunday yesterday that Nottinghamshire police interviewed her last week. ‘I have not told them everything, just what they need to know,’ Miss Turley, 22, said. ‘I don’t want to get involved. There is a potential threat to my safety. I have taken advice from a solicitor who has said they cannot force me to co-operate.’ In an exchange with Melissa Reid’s mother on Facebook, Miss Turley admitted she introduced Melissa to the man her daughter says forced her to become a drugs mule. Asked by Debra Reid to ‘tell us what you know about what has happened to our beautiful daughter’ Miss Turley replied: ‘I met a guy whom I introduced to Mel as we was all going out one night .  .  . ‘After he fuelled us all with drugs on what was a four-day binge he had somehow managed to have both mine and Mel’s passport details and we was booked on flights. ‘She was sent first and I went and hid for a few days as I was terrified. Mel assured me she was OK .  .  . I didn’t think it was her messaging me though, I thought it was the guys she was with.’ Later, she said, ‘the guys threatened us to keep quiet’ and added that when Melissa was arrested ‘they gave me 24 hours to disappear’. ‘I’ve come back home as I’m really scared for my safety .  .  . Mel never wanted to do this, the other girl was also forced. ‘I’m too scared to tell police in case these bad guys look for me.’ Miss Turley said the man who targeted the girls was called Joe, originally from Manchester, but now living in San Antonio, Ibiza. However, both arrested women said in statements to police that they knew him as Jake. Meanwhile in Ibiza, associates of a taxi driver called Joe, believed to be the man referred to by Miss Turley, dismissed suggestions that he handed the girls to a drugs gang as ‘unbelievable’. But Miss Turley told Melissa’s mother: ‘The only reason I can’t talk is people he [Joe] hangs round with know me from Nottingham which means he can find me and told me he will if I speak.’ Before signing off by apologising because her mother ‘doesn’t want me involved’, Miss Turley said she was willing for Mrs Reid to pass on her details to the ‘guy from the Foreign Office’. She added: ‘I feel like I have to do something – I introduced her to the guy before he started forcing us all.’ The Foreign Office declined to comment last night, beyond saying it was providing consular assistance. Nottinghamshire police also refused to discuss its involvement in the case. Melissa Reid, 20, is led away from the state prosecutor's office in Lima, her desperate mother asked Debra Reid asked Miss Turley to 'tell us what you know' Melissa Reid’s father William has made clear that there are elements of his daughter’s story that he would like ‘clarity on’. Only people such as Miss Turley, among others, can provide it, he said. ‘I would like the authorities to vigorously investigate them, track them down, question them. Have they got any further vital information?’ His wife added: ‘Melissa is very sociable and was probably too trusting and she was definitely naive to the drugs culture. ‘But she is no angel and I suspect she may have experimented alongside her friends out there. Sophie Lee Turley . ‘She is a good, honest girl and I believe she has been dragged into this against her will.’ The Mail on Sunday has established that the man named by Miss Turley works illegally as an unlicensed taxi driver on the Spanish holiday island. Also known as Joey, he is believed to live in cheap accommodation in San Antonio Bay, home to hundreds of young Britons working in bars and clubs for  the summer. He is thought to have spent the past two summers living in Ibiza, initially working for around six weeks last year pulling in customers off the street for the Active Bar in San Antonio Bay. The bar’s owner, a Scotsman called William, said: ‘He is back on the island this year, working as  a taxi driver. ‘I just can’t see him being involved in serious criminality and drugs gangs. It is just unbelievable.’","Sophie Lee Turley believes she introduced Melissa Reid to the drugs gang that sent her to Peru .

His comments follow an interview with French magazine Le Figaro that the controversy surrounding his self-imposed exile from France was a 'big misunderstanding.' Depardieu, 64, told the magazine: ''I never left! I refuse to be shut in by borders, that's completely different. 'I am a free man. I feel at home everywhere in Europe. 'This whole story is a big misunderstanding. I love France as much as ever. It's my country.'

Dreams: In an interview 3 years ago, murder victim Chris Lane describes his love for the U.S. An interview that murdered baseball player Chris Lane gave to a radio station in his native Australia has emerged, revealing his excitement at studying in the United States. In the interview with Sports Central in Melbourne three years ago, the then-19-year-old gushed about his experiences as a budding baseball player while attending college in Oklahoma. It is a state where, years later, would become the scene of his murder. On August 16, the student was gunned down as he went for a jog, allegedly by a group of teenagers who were 'bored'. 'I've only been over here for about two . months now and I can honestly say I've enjoyed every minute of it,' Lane said in the interview. 'It's certainly a great experience I'm having right now.' Lane, who was 22 when he was killed, is extremely humble in the interview, which can be heard in full on NewsOK. He told the host he is in the U.S. because 'I was really lucky'. 'I'm the only one that's you know, . studying in a foreign country and able to play a sport I love,' he said. 'If nothing, I'm going to gain an awesome . experience that I'm going to look back on for the rest of my life.' Lane said he had been playing baseball since he was five but added that, while he loved the sport, he was concentrating on getting a thorough education in the U.S. Devoted: Lane is pictured at East Central University, where he was on a baseball scholarship. In the interview, he said that he had loved every minute being in the U.S. and had big dreams for the future . 'Most important for me is to get the . education and I have the bonus of being a student athlete... if I get my . education sorted then everything goes right,' he said. The interview was carried out when he was at Redlands Community College, and he said that after two years there, he hoped to get into a four-year U.S. college - and maybe reach the major league. 'It would certainly be a dream,' he said. 'But you . know, you can only work hard and I've got hopefully four years, fingers . crossed over here, so there's plenty of opportunity to put my hand up . and see how far I can go.' In yet a further heartbreaking twist, he assured the host that the Americans loved having Australians in the country. The host concluded: 'We'll keep in touch with you over the next several years.' Alleged killers: James Edwards Jr, left, and Chancey Luna, right, are being charged with the first degree murder of Lane. Their friend Michael Jones is facing accessory to murder charges . Torn apart: Lane's girlfriend Sarah Harper has flown to Australia to mourn with his heartbroken family . After the interview, Lane was granted a scholarship to attend East Central University.

Police . have arrested James Francis Edwards Jr. 15, Chancey Allen Luna, 16, and . Michael Dewayne Jones, 17, in connection with the shooting. At the weekend, hundreds of friends gathered on 'Laney's' field of dreams in Melbourne, where his sporting life as a catcher had begun. Devastated relatives and friends released black and red balloons - the colors of the Essendon club where Lane had previously played - which were marked with his player's number, 40.

'They need to pick themselves up each day and get on with their lives. Whatever task you need to do, you get up each day and you have to move forward.' He and his wife, he said, had been moved by the 'tremendous tributes' to their son. 'So many people have been prepared to roll out and support him,' he said. 'He was much loved, but I have never doubted that for a minute.'

A team of ‘gastronauts’ have spent the past four months living in a small dome on a barren Hawaii lava field, trying to find out what foods astronauts might eat on a mission to Mars. They emerged yesterday with their recipes and without the space suits they were required to wear each time they ventured onto the northern slope of Mauna Loa - an active volcano that last erupted in 1984. The group of six had been working as part of a $1 million Nasa HI-SEAS (Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation) project on an isolated slope of a Hawaiian volcano. A team of six researchers have spent the past four months living in a small dome on a barren Hawaii lava field, trying to find out what foods astronauts might eat on a mission to Mars. They emerged yesterday with their results . The aim of the project, funded by NASA’s Human Research Program, the University of Hawaii and Cornell University, was to learn about living and cooking for long-duration space missions. In between other research projects, the team cooked up meals that were divided between freeze-dried food and meals they were able to cook themselves from the food available at the time. Team commander Angelo Vermeulen said the problem with ingredients that are not perishable is they're usually highly processed and lack fibre. He added that he was impressed with how freeze dried products taste very similar to fresh produce. But what is also important for future space missions is comfort food, he said. A favourite among the crew was nutella, the chocolate-hazelnut spread. ‘It's something we craved,’ he said. ‘We had a limited supply so we had to ration it.’ A favourite among the crew was nutella, the chocolate-hazelnut spread, and sweet cakes . The study included an open call for recipes that involved a lot of Spam. The canned meat, popular in Hawaii households, was a common ingredient in suggested recipes because of its shelf-life, said Kim Binsted, a UH-Manoa associate professor who is an investigator on the study but didn't live in the habitat. The researchers prepared several dishes using Spam, including a Cajun jambalaya and a fried rice noodle dish. Couscous was also popular with the researchers almost instantly running out of the ingredient. According to Nasa, longer space exploration in the future, namely missions to Mars in the 2030s, present the new challenge of providing food systems to support years-long journeys. The team cooked up meals that were divided between freeze-dried food and meals they were able to cook themselves from the food available at the time. Pancakes were a popular choice . Canned meat was a common ingredient in suggested recipes for the team  because of its shelf-life . ‘We’re looking at how much of the food for a Mars surface mission should be processed packaged food systems versus a bio-regenerative food system, which is growing fresh fruits and vegetables,’ said Michele Perchonok, Advanced Food Technology Project scientist at NASA. On a mission to Mars, astronauts may be able to grow their own food as well as bring along raw ingredients that they can make into tofu, bread, pasta, and flour. ‘They may make a meal with fresh pasta with a pasta sauce made from a tomato and green onions and bell peppers in the garden and then maybe make bread from the flour also. Maybe even have cookies at the end of the meal,’ Ms Perchonok said. However, there are several challenges to feeding a hungry crew in space. The food needs a five-year shelf life and enough variety to stay interesting. Ms Perchonok has collaborated with . Jean Hunter, associate professor of biological and environmental . engineering, to research why astronauts lose their sense of taste in . space. In low gravity more body fluids shift to the head, affecting the sense of smell. According to Nasa, longer space exploration in the future, namely missions to Mars in the 2030s, present the new challenge of providing food systems to support years-long journeys . The HI-SEAS Habitat is located at approximately 8000 ft elevation in an abandoned quarry on the northern slope of Mauna Loa in Hawaii. The site contains little vegetation, no rare, threatened or endangered species, and no archaeological sites or cultural practices . Early in a mission, astronauts of ten develop round ‘Charlie Brown; faces because of the fluid, and they feel like they have a cold, Ms Perchonok said. Ms Hunter’s research is testing whether this affects the amount astronauts can taste. In a separate project, volunteers will spend several weeks in a bed with their heads lower than their feet. The Cornell team will measure how fluid buildup in the head affects their sense of smell and how long that effect lasts. ‘We’ll . get a better understanding of how much of sensory loss of flavour is . due to the fluid shift and how much might be due to other pieces,’ said .

Divers found the sizable carving covering the stern and bowcastle of the 130ft-long merchant vessel, which would have been one of the largest of its kind on the seas at the time. It was decked out with opulent carvings of mermen whose eye sockets would have been decorated with precious stones.

Marine archaeologists from Bournemouth University have already recovered scores of artefacts from the vessel that is known as the Swash Channel Wreck after the area of sea where it sunk. And after being given a grant of £500,000 from English Heritage, the team today completed the recovery of the five tonne wooden rudder that had become separated from the main hull. Last month divers spent seven days digging the rudder from out of the sea bed and placing a large steel frame around it, similar to the operation that raised the Mary Rose in 1982.

It was then towed four miles into Poole Harbour where today it was hoisted onto the quayside by a crane in front of the excited team of archaeologists. The baroque facial carving on the end of the rudder shows a military man wearing a classical helmet.It will be constantly sprayed with special chemicals for the next two years to help conserve it. The rudder will then put on display at Poole Museum alongside other artifacts recovered from the wreckage. The rudder is being temporarily stored at Poole docks, before being transported to York. It was towed four miles into Poole Harbour where today it was hoisted onto the quayside (pictured) by a crane in front of the excited team of archaeologists . Dave Parham, a senior lecturer in marine archaeology at Bournemouth University, said: 'Before now we had just seen the rudder underwater where you could only make out a few feet of it at a time. 'So to see it in day light in all its glory is really quite spectacular. 'It is a very large and impressive item itself so you can imagine how spectacular this merchant vessel would have looked. 'Its discovery is an extremely significant one and has given way to one of the largest shipwreck investigations within the UK.' Another carving previously discovered at the wreck of the Dutch trading ship near Poole, Dorset . Unlike the Mary Rose, little is known of the Swash Channel Wreck, including its identity. Tests on the oak wood from it have dated the felling of the timber to 1628 and from forests on the Dutch/German border. Analysis of some of the recovered artefacts date to the middle of the 17th century. This has led the experts to believe the vessel was an armed Dutch trading ship that was either going to or returning from the Mediterranean or the Far East.

It is thought it hit a sandbank in the approaches to Poole Harbour and water flooded its bilges. The ship is then believed to have rolled over and sunk in 22ft of water. Mr Parham said: 'It would have been a very big vessel for its day and the whole vessel would have been a spectacular work or art. 'It was a sign of prestige and wealth. It was making a statement, showing how great and wonderful the owners were. Mr Parham said the ship could be compared to a 17th century version of the luxurious Titanic liner, although the Titanic was ornate for passengers, and not just for those viewing the ship.

So far the team has brought up artefacts including five baroque carvings, ceramic pieces, leather shoes, copper and pewter plates and cups and a bronze compass divider. They have also recovered animal bones of sheep and cows that would have fed the crew.

The UK price reductions for both the Vita and PS3 have not yet been officially announced. The PS4 already has a million pre-orders, according to Sony, but gaming experts said the launch date could play into the hands of main rival Microsoft, which has yet to announce when its Xbox One will go on sale. Althought the company has hinted it will be sometime in the same month as the PS4. 'From Microsoft's point of view it looks pretty good,' said Seth Barton of technology website Expert Reviews.

He added: 'It's quite possible both consoles will sell out before Christmas and you won't be able to get either of them.' Last week it emerged that retailers were halting pre-orders of the PS4, prompting fears of a shortage at Christmas. A high level of interest in the £349 console is leading to shops warning customers that new orders will not guarantee a machine at launch.

PS4 provides access to social networks including Facebook and Twitter while Sony has also promised to develop cloud technology to enable users to play their old games via the internet. Anticipation is high because it is seven years since the last PlayStation and eight years since the previous Xbox. Virgin Media has been confirmed as the broadband partner for the PS4, but no further details were given. When the console was announced in June, the loudest applause came when Jack Tretton, president and CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment America, announced that the company would not try to restrict used game sales. Tretton was making reference to Microsoft's plans to restrict second-hand game sales on its Xbox One console. During its own E3 event earlier the same day, Microsoft confirmed that every game bought for the Xbox One must be installed to the system and linked to the user's profile. The games can then be played on other consoles, but the user will have to access it through a cloud server each time. Other people's profiles can play games on a user's console at any time, and up to ten family members can log in and play shared games on other systems, but not at the same time.

The body, which was pulled from a bog in 2011, is 700 years older than the famous mummy of Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun. The young adult male,  whose 4,000-year-old remains were found in County Laois, Ireland, is believed to have been a victim of ritual sacrifice. The bog body in the Bord Na Mona Cashel Bog, in County Laois, was found by Jason Phelan, Bord Na Mona Machine operator . Archaeologists have speculated that he could have been used in a type of ritual sacrifice, which was more common in the later Iron Age. The mummy was dug from the Cúl na Móna bog in Cashel around two years ago by a Bord na Móna worker who was operating a milling machine, The Irish Times reported. Experts first presumed that the remains dated from the Iron Age period, which stretched from 500 BC to 400 AD, matching other bodies found in Irish bogs. But radiocarbon tests confirmed the body dated from the early Bronze Age - some 4,000 years ago. Analysis on the peat that buried the body and a wooden stake found with the remains confirmed the assessment. The find is predicted to shed new light on life and the burial practices of the Bronze Age in Ireland. Eamonn Kelly, keeper of Irish antiquities at the National Museum of Ireland, told the newspaper the oldest bog body discovered before in Ireland dates to 1,300BC. The mummy was found in a crouched position, covered in peat. The Cashel man's arm was broken and he suffered cuts to his back that could have been deliberately made with a blade . He said the 'Cashel man' is one of the most significant archaeological finds in recent times. The mummy was found in a crouched position, covered in peat.

While scientists will probably never know the cause of death, Mr Kelly said the wounds on the body alongside the presence of wooden stakes, suggest that the boy was a victim of a ritual sacrifice. The body was also found near an inauguration site, which strengthens his theory. He told the newspaper: 'It seems to be same type of ritual that . we’ve observed in later Iron Age finds. What’s surprising here is that . it’s so much earlier.' While scientists will probably never know the cause of death, the wounds on the body alongside the presence of wooden stakes, suggest that the boy was a victim of a ritual sacrifice . The archaeologist also believes the victim was probably from a relatively important family as similar bodies recovered did not have calluses on their hands and their fingernails were well cared for. However, the hands were missing from this particular body. Mr Kelly said: 'We believe that the victims of these . ritual killings are kings that have failed in their kingship and have . been sacrificed as a consequence.'

They described the event, which occurred in 2011, as ‘like a maelstrom’ and as if ‘the sea was boiling.’ Some captured the waves on their mobile phones, watching the water ebb and flow to great heights for several hours at a time. Now, a new study has revealed that the mystery waves were in fact made by the huge magnitude-9.0 earthquake that devastated Japan in 2011. Scroll down for video .

They can occur in any landlocked body of water, such as a lake and are often by strong winds. In some cases they can be created by earthquakes thousands of miles away. Norwegian fjords are particularly sensitive to the natural occurrence because of their great depths. Back in 1950, the Assam earthquake triggered waves in 29 fjords in Norway and in English reservoirs. However, the latest finding is the first known recording of Norwegian seiches caused by an earthquake for over half a century. Fjords pointing northeast toward Japan, in five towns, started moving half an hour after the Japan earthquake and continued to do so for almost three hours. ‘I realised there must be a connection with the big earthquake in Japan,’ Stein Bondevik, a geologist at Sogn og Fjordane University College in Sogndal, told LiveScience. ‘I was so excited I couldn't sleep that night thinking about it.’ Bondevik and his team used videos taken by eye witnesses and built a computer model to test their theory by timing the ebb and flow of the oscillations. He found that these seiches were triggered from horizontal S waves caused by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. An S-wave is a seismic body wave that shakes the ground back and forth perpendicular to the direction the wave is moving. Mr Bondevik claims that in fjords pointed northeast, the S-waves from the Japan earthquake moved the ground back and forth by 0.4 inches.

An American pastor from Idaho who was sentenced to eight years in one of Iran's harshest prisons for preaching Christianity in Iranian homes had his appeal to reduce the sentence rejected on Sunday. Saeed Abedini, a U.S. citizen who was born in Iran, has been held since September 2012 and was charged with 'threatening the national security of Iran'. The 33-year-old father-of-two says he was in the country only to establish an orphanage and was not preaching Christianity. Jailed: Pastor Saeed Abedini was sentenced to eight years in prison on charges that he preached Christianity in the Islamic nation. His attempt to appeal the sentence was rejected today by Iran . Family man: Mr Abedini, seen here with his wife Naghmeh and their two young children, has a home in Idaho and is a U.S. citizen . The pastor's attorney was not given a copy of the ruling handed down by two judges. Pastor Saeed’s wife Naghmeh told ACLJ.org that the ruling was 'devastating'. She added her disappointment at the lack of intervention by the American government on her husband's case. Mrs Saeed said today: 'As we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the historic speech defending freedom by Dr. Martin Luther King, a brave American who gave his life to fight for the freedom that is so fundamental to our way of life, I am extremely disappointed that President Obama has chosen to remain silent on this critical human and religious rights case of an American imprisoned in Iran.' The American Center for Law and Justice, which is working with Mr Abedini's family to free him from Iranian . custody, says that the country has shown 'utter disregard' for the pastor's human rights. The organization said that they are exploring all options to further the married father's bid for freedom. Campaign: The American Center for Law and Justice, a legal advocacy group founded by televangelist Pat Robertson, has been working on Mr Abedini's behalf . It says the pastor led house churches in the Islamic nation in the . early 2000s, when the state did not consider such activities a threat. Mr Abedini is being held in Evin Prison in Tehran, the notorious gulag that houses most of the country's political prisoners. He has suffered internal bleeding and fainting episodes after being beaten by prison guards. He is also threatened by radicals because he is a Christian. In January, the ACLJ, a legal advocacy group founded by televangelist Pat Robertson, reports that Revolutionary Court Judge Pir-Abassi convicted and sentenced Mr Abedini after a hastily-called court hearing.

Badgers might be known for being a menace in gardens by digging up lawns, but the creatures have proved they can be useful by helping German archaeologists uncover the graves of Medieval warriors. At least eight graves were found at a site in north Germany, including a skeleton still clutching a sword and 'wearing' an intricate belt buckle in the shape of a serpent. An artist saw the badgers digging up bones and called experts to find out what the creatures had uncovered. This nobleman was buried with a bronze belt buckle of a snakes head, a double edge sword and bowl by his feet ( all pictured). Archaeologists said he was a well-equipped warrior. Scars and bone-breaks show that he had been hit by lances and swords, and had also fallen from a horse . Artist Lars Wilhelm realised the badgers were digging into a grave, when he was watching them near his home in Brandenburg, according to a German news website. He has been studying the badger set for around five years and told The Local: 'My wife and I are both sculptors. [We] wanted to put artworks in there'. However, their plans have been scuppered by the discovery of the bones. Mr Wilhelm called experts as soon as he realised the animals might have broken into a grave, the Berliner Zeitung newspaper reported. Archaeologists expanded on the badgers' helpful excavation work to uncover eight graves, including two skeletons that appear to noblemen. The archaeologists (pictured) were alerted to the discovery of old skeletons by an artist living in Brandenburg, north Germany, who had seen badgers recover bones . Professor Felix Biermann from the Ernst-August University in Göttingen, who lead the dig, believes the badgers found late Slavish graves that date from the 12th Century.

MPs last night condemned a ruling that allows a convicted terrorist to continue walking the streets of Britain 12 years after he first arrived here. Ministers are powerless to expel the 50-year-old Algerian, known only as AH, even though he was refused asylum on the grounds that, as a terrorist, he cannot claim refugee status. He cannot be booted out of the UK because his ‘life and liberty’ are judged to be in jeopardy if he returns to his home country, where he was convicted in 1993 of complicity in the bombing of Algiers airport, which killed nine people. Blast: The man's 'life and liberty' are judged to be in jeopardy if he returns to his home country, where he was convicted in 1993 of complicity in the bombing of Algiers airport (file picture), which killed nine people . He was also imprisoned in France for two years for his involvement in a terrorist group. France simply expelled him as an ‘undesirable’, after which he fled to the UK – where he remains because the British system has not managed to do the same. Tory backbencher Douglas Carswell ridiculed the idea that a terrorist could secure refuge with the argument that his life is at risk if he is sent home. He said: ‘If you dedicate your career to blowing people up, your life may well be at risk – but that’s an occupational hazard of being a terrorist; it’s not our problem.’ Mr Carswell added: ‘It’s not just AH who should be in the dock, it is the immigration tribunal system which prevents us from removing a convicted killer. ‘Until we have democratic accountability over immigration tribunals, we can have no confidence in them. Why should our country be a haven for Algerian terrorists? What part of “get out” does the immigration system not understand? ‘Our country is signed up to the same idiotic human rights as France, but somehow France manages to stand up to the security of their country better than we do. Yet again, we seem to be the mugs in all of this.’ The legal battle has cost British . taxpayers hundreds of thousands of pounds, and all the while it is . believed AH has been living on benefits. The Upper Immigration Tribunal judges . rejected his latest appeal last month, but AH is challenging their . ruling in the Court of Appeal. 'Get out': Tory backbencher Douglas Carswell ridiculed the idea that a terrorist could secure refuge with the argument that his life is at risk if he is sent home . Now the Home Office is hoping to get a bilateral deal with Algeria in a bid to secure his deportation. This could include guarantees about his treatment on return to the country. It would be similar to a treaty signed between Britain and Jordan which resulted in the deportation of hate cleric Abu Qatada earlier this year. Another Tory MP, Philip Davies, said: . ‘This is completely ridiculous. This man is not a British citizen, he is . a foreign national and if we don’t want him to be in our country we . should be able to kick him out. People will be staggered that he is . still here after 12 years.’ 'This is completely ridiculous. This man is not a British citizen, he is a foreign national and if we don’t want him to be in our country we should be able to kick him out' Philip Davies, Tory MP . The terrorist cannot be named because the Upper Immigration Tribunal granted him anonymity. Last month’s hearing is the latest stage in a mammoth legal battle fought by the terrorist, who first sought asylum here in 2001. In 1993, he was convicted in Algeria of involvement in a bombing at Algiers airport the year before. He was sentenced to death in his absence. At the time of that trial he was in France, and in October 1999 he was convicted there of being a member of an organisation created with a view to the preparation of acts of terrorism. AH was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment and on his release in July 2001 he was made subject to an exclusion order. He fled to the UK, where he claimed asylum. That claim was rejected but he has remained in the UK ever since.","Ministers powerless to expel Algerian aged 50 and known only as AH .

A probation officer who gave a domestic abuse victim's new address to her alleged attacker has been fined just £150. Picture posed by model . A probation officer who gave a domestic abuse victim’s new address to her alleged attacker has been fined just £150. Victoria Idowu sent the suspect a text message containing the woman’s full name, new address and date of birth. When the victim found out, she called police in fear, then moved house. She later cut off all contact with social services and police. The investigation against the alleged perpetrator – the woman’s partner – was later dropped. Idowu was working for the London Probation Trust when she contacted the Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference for details on the alleged abuser in January last year. She claims she then passed on the confidential details of the victim to him in an attempt to prevent a case of mistaken identity. Idowu, 39, of Stockwell, south London, has since been sacked for gross misconduct. Yesterday the mother of one was fined £150 with £270 costs after pleading guilty to breaching the Data Protection Act at Camberwell Green Magistrates’ Court. Sentencing her, District Judge Richard Hawgood said: ‘I am at a loss to know why a competent, experienced probation officer would have made the disclosure that you did. It really beggars belief. ‘It has been quite frankly a disaster for the victim of the offence, and a disaster for yourself.’ After the hearing, Idowu said she was also a victim of domestic abuse and would never have given out the information if she wasn’t completely sure the abuser already knew the victim’s address. She said: ‘I knew that he knew her address already. He had visited her at the house. ‘The man manipulated me and said it was his brother who was the abuser but it turned out it was him. ‘I made an error and it has bitten me a lot. I’m a victim myself and that is why I left my long-term partner when I was pregnant and I wouldn’t have told him any more information than he already knew.’ Karen Ingala Smith, chief executive of domestic violence charity nia, said the case exposed a ‘systematic failure’ in the treatment of victims. ‘This isn’t just about Victoria Idowu,’ she said. ‘There is a systematic failure to respond adequately to violence against women. ‘For too long governments have focused on it as a criminal justice issue if at all. But women continue to be failed.’ She added: ‘Women are at greatest risk of being murdered at the point of separation or after leaving a  violent partner. Domestic violence has killed an average of two women a week for at least the last ten years.’ Unlawfully obtaining or accessing personal data is a criminal offence under section 55 of the Data Protection Act 1998. The offence is punishable by way of ‘fine only’ – up to £5,000 in a magistrates court or an unlimited fine in a crown court. The Information Commissioner’s Office, which brought the case against Idowu, yesterday called on the Government to introduce tougher sentences on the unlawful use of personal information. Commissioner Christopher Graham, said: ‘This is the unpleasant but unremarkable face of data protection crime – not journalists, not lawyers, just individuals for whom the sentence holds no terror. ‘Idowu escaped with only a relatively minor penalty. The Government must act now to introduce tougher penalties.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Victoria Idowu claims she passed on .

But British beach-goers may also have less pleasant memories - as the warm weather has also brought a record season for dive-bombing seagulls. The reason, according to experts, is that the breeding season has been extended into the summer holidays... and chicks are still around to be protected - and fed. Invasion of the birdy snatchers: Seagulls attack a young man, who was holding an ice cream, and his friend on a beach in St Ives, Cornwall. The warm weather has brought a record season for the dive-bombing birds . Mark Riddick who owns the Dairy Maid cafe in the centre of the seaside town of Teignmouth, Devon is fighting back. Super Soakers waterpistols for customers and staff scare off the seagulls which plaque his restaurant . This has combined with an increase in the number of human targets visiting the coast - leading to countless clashes. The RSPB received over three times as many calls about seagulls last month in the South West compared with July 2012, up from 51 to 173. This year’s breeding season started out slowly because of the cold weather in March and April but heated up in June and July, culminating in a late feeding frenzy. An influx of visitors to beaches and resorts, meanwhile, is giving the brazen birds more opportunities to steal from humans. The reason for the increase in dive-bombing gulls, according to experts, is that the breeding season has been extended into the summer holidays - and chicks are still around to be protected and fed . In Cornwall, tourists face a daily barrage from dive-bombing gulls determined to grab ice creams, pasties and takeaways. In St Ives, the birds even make their nests directly above restaurants and snack bars and target tourists with ever more aggressive tactics, swooping down at 40mph to wrench away food from anyone foolhardy enough to eat in public. Seagull expert Peter Rock said the spike in food-snatching incidents is simply down to the bumper breeding season and the added opportunity to steal from tourists. Mr Rock said: ‘In 2013 we had an exceptionally cold start to the breeding season with a lot of birds postponing their breeding until July and August. ‘We still have young birds waiting to fledge right now. It’s become a protracted breeding season. ‘In past summers, we’ve seen pretty awful weather, but this year some of the weather has been brilliantly sunny and hot. ‘That means a lots of people are on the beach with their food and their ice creams which the gulls are very adept at snatching, in St Ives in particular. ‘They really are very clever. One will swoop down so somebody moves their food away from the incoming bird only to find it snatched by a second bird working in cahoots.’ Matt Thomas, 29, manager of the Cornish Pasty Shop, in the resort, said yesterday: ‘This is by far the worst I have seen the seagulls. ‘We get people coming back to us on a daily basis saying how they’ve had their pasties taken. ‘There are far more of them this year and they are a lot more aggressive. They seem to work in groups and target young children.’ Donna Field, 52, visiting from Hertfordshire, added: ‘The seagulls are awful. They’re extremely aggressive and are really threatening. ‘Yesterday I was sitting eating on the beach when one seagull dived in, bit my hand and took my chicken. It knocked it out of my hand and onto the sand then took the piece. ‘Attacks happen all the time. I saw a little girl have an ice cream taken from her hand. She burst into tears and looked terrified.’ Jake Cashmore, 20, sales assistant at Willy Wallers ice cream parlour, added: ‘Seagulls have always been a problem here but they’re becoming more tactical and are attacking more often. ‘The problem has become so bad that we now warn every customer about them and have signs up in our shop.’ Another possible explanation behind the gulls' extra aggression is that they are becoming ‘drunk’ feasting on flying ants, of which there are record numbers due to the hot weather. The ants turn to acid in their stomachs and act like alcohol, apparently lowering the birds’ inhibitions and making them ever more bold. On the prowl: In St Ives, Cornwall (above), the birds even make their nests directly above restaurants and snack bars and target tourists with ever more aggressive tactics, swooping down at 40mph to wrench away food from anyone foolhardy enough to eat in public . Cornwall Council insists the gulls in St Ives are legally protected members of a wild species and thus cannot simply be culled. Over the years it has tried various schemes to curb the menace - including ‘bird dispersal units’ who go around playing high-pitched tapes of gulls squawking in distress to scare them off. Elsewhere in Britain, the urban gull population is growing by 20 per cent a year. Bristol City Council is using artificial eggs to trick seagulls into thinking they are rearing young to stem a spate of dive-bomb attacks in the city centre. RSPB spokesman Tony Whitehead said most run-ins between humans and seagulls (St Ives, above) were simply the result of birds innocently trying to protect their chicks . Authorities in Cumbria have introduced a fine for feeding seagulls and wildlife experts in Aberdeen have even tried feeding them contraceptives. The RSPB has also had to warn against vigilante attacks, with reports of nuisance birds being kicked to death and lured into the paths of cars. RSPB spokesman Tony Whitehead said most run-ins between humans and seagulls were simply the result of birds innocently trying to protect their chicks. He said: ‘This is the time of year when chicks begin to hatch. Of course, they remain flightless for some time but this period normally only lasts for a few weeks. ‘During that time, the gulls become very aggressive towards humans. ‘There’s been an increased number of phone calls to us this year, more so than the past eight or so years from the Cornwall area, and we’re not sure why. ‘But once the young have begun to fly, it usually calms down. I think the issue will pass very soon.’","RSPB received over three times as .

The unexpected warm summer boosted trading at Britain’s hotels, pubs and restaurants as holiday makers took advantage of the soaring temperatures, a new report shows. But profits were hit due to the double whammy of rising raw materials costs and fierce competition that kept prices low, says the CBI’s quarterly service sector survey. Business activity in the service sector overall grew to its highest level since 2007 and confidence rose strongly. Boost: The warm summer helped Britain's hotels, pubs and restaurants as tourists took advantage. However profits have been hit by rising costs elsewhere . But it was in the consumer services sector, which also includes the travel and leisure industries, that profitability dropped unexpectedly as price growth stalled and jobs also fell, the business lobby group showed. However volumes did manage to rise over the three months to August - at their fastest rate since the beginning of the downturn. Stephen Gifford, director of economics at the CBI said: ‘Consumer services firms are a bit more worried about the longer-term and have scaled back their investment and expansion plans. ‘Conditions remain tricky as households grapple with the prolonged squeeze on real incomes and business confidence remains vulnerable to any adverse developments in the global economy. But all being well, business should continue to pick up through this year and into the next.’ Stephen Gifford said that conditions remain tricky as households grapple with the prolonged squeeze on real incomes and business confidence remains vulnerable to any adverse developments in the global economy . The figures for the business and professional services - including accountancy, law and marketing - painted a healthier picture, with both volumes and profitability up. But these form a much smaller portion of services. The data is the latest indicator of the health of the British economy after revised official figures last week showed it grew by 0.6per cent in the second quarter, better than previously thought. Services which are the powerhouse of the economy, represent three-quarters of output and have been central to leading the UK out of the downturn, so a continued acceleration in volume growth will be a welcome boost. But the fall in profit across the consumer-focused firms will fuel fears that the recovery may not be sustainable. The survey found that a balance of 15per cent of companies in consumer services saw business volumes grow, a level that has not been reached since August 2007. Optimism was also high, with a positive reading of 28per cent. However, fewer firms saw profitability increase than saw it decrease - giving a negative 15per cent reading, the worst since February last year, with a further fall expected over the next three months. Numbers employed also slid and are expected to fall further, while businesses are more likely not to expand over the following year. The business and professional services sector saw a positive volume growth reading of 20per cent, the best since November 2007, with optimism also up, as well as profitability and jobs, and a growing likelihood of expansions. The CBI findings came from a survey of 97 business and professional services firms and 64 consumer services firms.","Business activity in service sector reaches highest level since 2007 .

Charity Commission staff are being accused of squandering nearly £40,000 of public money at five-star hotels around the globe. The watchdog, which received £22million of taxpayer cash this year, recently criticised wasteful spending by UK charities. But details of its spending on corporate credit cards, released under Freedom of Information laws, reveals that the Commission has racked up bills of more than £38,000 in less than two years at exclusive hotels. Luxurious: In May last year one staff member spent £430.75 on a room at the Kempinski Nile hotel in Cairo, which bills itself as a 'five-star boutique hotel' Most of the costs were run up by a four-strong team that works for the Commission’s International Programme, which advises other countries how to run their own charity and NGO sectors. In a two-day spell in January this year, six credit card bills totalled £3,236.76 at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in the Qatari capital, Doha. The five-star hotel, one of the most expensive in the Middle East, advertises itself as the ‘very definition of an opulent Middle Eastern paradise’. It features eight ‘exceptional’  restaurants, two swimming pools and a marina. In March this year, Commission staff ran up bills in excess of £11,000, including stays in Dubai, Vienna, New York and Ottawa. Spending: In a two-day spell in January this year, six credit card bills totalled £3,236.76 at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in the Qatari capital, Doha .

In May last year one staff member spent £430.75 on a room at the Kempinski Nile hotel in Cairo, which bills itself as a ‘five-star boutique hotel’. In September 2012, one member of the Commission was at the five-star Hotel Borobudur in the Indonesia capital Jakarta, with eight restaurants and 23 acres of tropical gardens. Staff have stayed at the Sheraton in the Saudi city of Jeddah, which advertises ‘breathtaking views of the Red Sea’. The documents also reveal that staff claimed expenses to dine at expensive eateries such as Westminster’s upscale Indian restaurant Cinnamon Club, where main courses can cost more than £30, and the Tabard Inn, a boutique restaurant in Washington DC. Commission staff made undisclosed purchases on expenses at a range of retailers including Amazon, Tesco, Boots and Marks & Spencer. The credit card spending detailed in the papers covers the period between October 2011, when Dame Suzi Leather was chairman of the commission, to the end of March this year under new chairman William Shawcross and £135,000-a-year chief executive Sam Younger. Last week, when it emerged that at least 30 charity chiefs are paid in excess of £100,000, Mr Shawcross said that ‘in these difficult times’ charities ‘should consider whether very high salaries are really appropriate, and fair to both the donors and the taxpayers who  fund charities’.

But in just a few hours, a stretch of Offa’s Dyke – considered one of the most important ancient monuments in Britain – was flattened. The damage to the aged earthwork, which is in a World Heritage site, was described by horrified experts as akin to ‘driving a road through Stonehenge’. Police and Cadw, the heritage arm of the Welsh Government, are investigating allegations that a group of travellers had destroyed part of Offa's Dyke. Above, the section that was dug away . It is believed King Offa of Mercia built it between 757 and 796 to mark the division between Mercia and Wales and protect his land from invasion . Last night, police and Cadw, the heritage arm of the Welsh Government, confirmed they were investigating allegations that a group of travellers had destroyed part of the protected dyke. The 8th century monument, a linear earthwork which consists of a wide ditch and rampart, runs for 82 miles along the border between England and Wales. It is believed King Offa of Mercia built it between 757 and 796 to mark the division between Mercia and Wales and protect his land from invasion. It is a criminal offence to disrupt or damage the dyke, which is designated a ‘scheduled ancient monument’ because of its historical significance, and anyone caught doing so can be punished with six months in jail or a £5,000 fine. The section affected is close to the Pontcysyllte aqueduct in a spectacular area of countryside centred on the 126ft canal boat crossing, which towers over the River Dee in the Vale of Llangollen, north Wales. Unesco awarded the 18th century aqueduct world heritage status in 2009, putting it in the category of the Egyptian pyramids, the Taj Mahal and the Acropolis in Greece. At least 50 yards of the dyke was allegedly flattened last Sunday. Residents reported seeing men with a large digger clearing scrub and weeds along the dyke, close to the A5 between Llangollen and Chirk. Over several hours, they flattened the embankment and filled in the ditch to level it.

Her mother - a second cousin to Prince Charles - married New York City businessman Howard Oxenberg but divorced when Christina was three (but not before rumors that the author's real father was JFK, according to People). Princess Elizabeth later came close to marrying Richard Burton. She also had a brief foray selling perfume called Princess Elizabeth on QVC. Christina's sister Catherine Oxenberg is best known for playing Amanda Carrington on the soap opera Dynasty. The author was once married to artist Damian Elwes - the brother of actor Cary Elwes who starred in the horror movies Saw. She told the magazine: 'I haven't . eaten red meat in 20 years, and although Leo's not totally responsible, . he definitely planted a seed.' It's All Good, written by Paltrow and Julia Turshen, a seasoned cookbook author and journalist, is a tome to the actress's 'elimination diet', described as 'no coffee, no alcohol, no dairy, no eggs, no sugar, no shellfish, no deep-water fish, no wheat, no meat, no soy, nothing processed at all!' Miss Paltrow also said recently that her family’s gluten-free diet left the children with a ‘specific hunger . that comes with avoiding carbs’. But she dismissed criticism about her . love for faddish diets. She said: ‘I was really lucky to have two . healthy children, and I enjoy raising them and watching these amazing . human beings start to come out and be themselves.’ Along . with Paltrow and celebrity friends Alec and Hilaria Baldwin, the . library fundraiser was attended by authors Jay McInerney, Robert Caro, .

July - the month in which Prince George of Cambridge was born - is often the busiest month for births, figures suggest. Data obtained by the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) shows July was the busiest month on England's labour wards for five out of the 11 years up to and including 2011. More boys than girls are born in every month of every year, according to the analysis of figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). July - the month in which Prince George of Cambridge was born - is often the busiest month for births in England, figures from the Royal College of Midwives have shown . They were published following a parliamentary question by Liberal Democrat MP for St Ives Andrew George. It comes after figures published by the ONS last week showed the number of babies born in the UK is at its highest for four decades. A total of 813,200 births were recorded between June 2011 and June 2012, giving the UK its biggest baby boom since 1972. The rise has been attributed to larger numbers of women in their 20s and 30s becoming mothers, along with an increase in the number of migrant families. More boys than girls are born in every month of every year. Picture shows Prince George as he left hospital . The new analysis shows there were . 174,653 more boys than girls born in England from 2001 to 2011. This . means for every 100 girls born, there were 105 boys. When . the birth data is split by region, September is the most popular month . for boys in the North East, while in the North West it is August and in . the West Midlands it is October. Figures for girls show similar variations. In the East Midlands, July and September are jointly the most popular months for girls, whilst in the South East and South West, October comes out top. Cathy Warwick, chief executive of the RCM, said: ‘These are fun statistics but with a serious message behind them: not only is the baby boom continuing apace but even within years there are peaks of activity that put additional, acute pressure on midwives. ‘The Government realises that there is a real need for more midwives and isn't shy about admitting it. ‘We know they are putting extra investment into training more midwives and that is really welcome, especially given the pressure on the public finances. ‘What we now need to see is extra effort from trusts up and down the country to staff maternity services appropriately. ‘We need to see women getting adequate antenatal care, and importantly much better postnatal care. ‘Giving women support, advice and care in those first days and weeks is incredibly important, and that's true whether it is a boy, a girl, or even a prince.’","July was the busiest month on labour wards for five of the 11 years to 2011 .

Thousands of Chicago children whose schools were shuttered last spring walked to new ones on the first day of school today under the watchful eye of police officers. They were also joined by newly hired safety guards - there to provide protection as the kids crossed unfamiliar streets, many of them gang boundaries. No incidents of trouble were reported, police said. Chicago Police patrol the neighborhood as Crystal Stoval delivers her niece Kayla Porter from their south side home to Gresham Elementary School today . A Chicago Police officer patrolling the neighborhood watches school children board a buss outside Gresham Elementary School . While that didn't surprise parents and grandparents, they said they were still concerned that the city's obvious show of first-day force won't keep their children safe in the weeks and months to come. 'I think it's just show-and-tell right now,' said Annie Stovall, who walked her granddaughter, nine-year-old Kayla Porter, to Gresham Elementary School, which is about five blocks farther from home than Kayla's previous South Side school. 'Five, six weeks down the road, let's see what's going to happen.' Kathy Miller stood in front of Gresham Elementary with her three children, waiting for a bus that would take them to another school. She scoffed at the Safe Passage program, in which guards clad in neon vests line Chicago streets, saying it won't be long before brightly colored signs announcing the program's routes will be riddled with bullets. Annie Stovall, left, walks with her daughter Crystal Stoval, right, and her granddaughter Kayla Porter to Gresham Elementary School in Chicago . Thousands of students will walk newly designated Safe Passage routes after Chicago Public Schools announced in May it would close about 50 schools and programs . 'Those signs don't mean nothing,' she said. The preparation and show of force shows what's at stake for Chicago Public Schools, the nation's third-largest school district, after it closed almost 50 schools last spring in the hopes of improving academic performance and saving millions of dollars. About 12,000 of the district's 400,000 students were affected by the closures. For months, parents, teachers and community activists have warned that forcing children to pass through some of the city's more impoverished and dangerous neighborhoods — where some already walking in the middle of the street to avoid being ambushed by gang members — to get to school puts them at undue risk. Statistics suggest those concerns are valid. An analysis of Chicago crime data by WBEZ-FM found that in 2013, there have been 133 shootings and 38 homicides in and around areas that have been newly marked as Safe Passage routes. Chicago Police patrol the neighborhood as children arrive at Gresham Elementary School . Crystal Stoval delivers her niece Kayla Porter to Gresham Elementary School on the first day of classes Monday, Aug. 26 . And if the attention Chicago received after a 15-year-old honor student was killed about a mile from President Barack Obama's home in January is any indication, there is no doubt a similar media firestorm will occur if a child is caught in gang crossfire on the way to or from school. One officer standing outside Gresham Elementary summed up the pressure the police department and City Hall are under this year, joking that children 'better not get a splinter or we'll all be out of a job.' With the hope of preventing problems, the financially strapped city hired 600 workers at a rate of $10 an hour to supplement a Safe Passage program that has existed since 2009, — launched the same year a Chicago honors student's beating death was videotaped. Police worked with residents and CPS to map out routes near 52 of the so-called 'welcoming schools' that are taking in students from the closed schools. Along those routes, the city has put up scores of 'Safe Passage' signs. Mayor Rahm Emanuel also deployed city departments to repair sidewalks, replace street lights, paint over graffiti and board up nearly 300 abandoned buildings. On Monday, Emanuel didn't mention Safe Passage, focusing instead on changes that have been made for this school year, starting with a full day of kindergarten. But last week, he told about 1,000 people at a training session that the program is 'about more than just building a route to school. Safety Guard Renee Green high-fives Demari Hill, 5, as she heads to school . 'It is about building a route to college, career and beyond...' he said. Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy said Monday he was pleased with how things were going, particularly in what he saw as evidence of community and parent involvement. 'I'm seeing small groups of kids being walked to school by their parents, or their older brothers or sisters,' McCarthy told reporters. 'This goes to the heart of what we've been talking about since I've been here, which is . to me, this is an opportunity. This is true community policing.' But crime statistics and shootings, like the one in the Uptown neighborhood last week along a Safe Passage route, only underline what parents say is a fact of life: Danger lurks. 'They will ride to school for the rest of their life, as long as I'm in Chicago,' Jennifer Press said, explaining her determination to keep her kids out of harm's way and from gangs from preying on them. She was at Gresham Elementary to register her four-year-old daughter there because the pre-Kindergarten class at a school closer to her home is full. For her part, nine-year-old Kayla professed she wasn't worried about all the gangs and the dangers of the streets that she's heard her grandmother, Annie Stovall, and other grown-ups talk about — as long as her grandmother and aunt who walked with her to school are nearby. 'I'm going to be OK, as long as they're with me,' she said.","Safe Passage program hires protection hires for Chicago Public Schools as students cross gang boundaries .

Many areas will begin to feel much more autumnal, with temperatures in some parts of the North falling to single figures. Rain looks set to sweep in over much of the country this weekend . Last night rain swept in over the North West and will continue today across the South East. Tomorrow, a second band of rain will arrive, with heavy downpours expected in the North. But by Sunday the rain will begin to lift, giving way to drier weather moving up from the South. And by Thursday and Friday temperatures could even reach 25C (77F) – above the 21C (70F) average for this time of year – just in time for the Bank Holiday. Meteogroup forecaster Tom Obler said: ‘There will be rain today and tomorrow because an area of low pressure is moving in. ‘It will come in from Ireland before hitting the North and then the Southern and Central areas. ‘It’s fairly normal for this time of year. There will be a few days when it will feel a bit autumnal but next week we will see some warmer weather, especially in the South.’ Yesterday, London and the east of England enjoyed warm, humid weather and temperature highs of up to 25C. But in Wales and the Western parts of England, there were already outbreaks of rain in the afternoon and evening. Today’s cooler weather marks a strong contrast with July’s record-breaking heatwave, when temperatures soared past 30C (86F).

Eric Pickles, Communities Secretary, said every new home should have a hiding place for a wheelie bin to stop streets being blighted by 'ugly clutter' Every new home should have a hiding place for a wheelie bin to stop streets being blighted by ‘ugly clutter’, Eric Pickles said yesterday. The Local Government Secretary called for ‘bin-tidy’ spaces to be built into the front of houses and flats, or for space to be made available for bins in the back yard. Building and planning regulations will demand that housing designers include space for ‘proper waste storage’ in new properties, Mr Pickles said. His bid to reduce ‘bin blight’ is the latest attempt to soften the impact of a Whitehall-driven move towards compulsory recycling. Millions of homes have been issued with wheelie bins, often in areas where there is nowhere to store them. Mr Pickles said he was ‘getting rid of barmy bin policies which made families’ lives hell.’ He added: ‘I want to make sure families get a proper rubbish and recycling collection service for the large amount of money they have to pay in council tax. ‘Thanks to ill-thought out town hall policies from the last government, badly-placed wheelie bins and the proliferation of multiple bins have created a blot on the landscape. ‘In streets up and down the country, ugly bin clutter has ruined the street scene and the look of people’s homes and gardens. By ensuring that developers create appropriate waste storage areas when designing new homes, we can tackle the ghastly gauntlet of bin-blighted streets and driveways.’ Mr Pickles, who once said it was the basic right of an Englishman to put chicken tikka masala in his bin without having to wait a fortnight for it to be collected, was the driving force behind a £250million fund to encourage councils to bring back weekly rubbish collections. Research has shown the initiative failed to restore weekly bin rounds, but did support councils that had chosen to keep them. Millions of homes have been issued with wheelie bins, often in areas where there is nowhere to store them . The Communities and Local Government Department has published new clauses for planning and design guidance which say every new home should have space for all the bins demanded by the local council. A consultation on housing standards to be published next week will say: ‘The Government places a high degree of importance in ensuring that suitable provision is made for waste storage in new homes, particularly to avoid bins dominating street frontages or contributing to increased levels of anti-social nuisance such as odour or litter. ‘This is sometimes referred to as bin blight, and the Government intends to bring this to an end.’ The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said this week the average amount recycled by individuals in England fell for the first time in 30 years last year.","Eric Pickles called for ‘bin-tidies' to be built in front of houses and flats .

Fizzy drinks make children as young as five violent, withdrawn and distracted, research suggests. A study found that boys and girls who had four soft drinks a day were more than twice as likely to get into fights, destroy others’ possessions and physically attack people, compared with those who drank other beverages. The sugar-laden drinks were linked with moodiness and difficulty in concentrating. The girls were as bad as the boys and the more soft drinks a child had, the worse their behaviour. Fizzy drinks: A study found that boys and girls who had four of the drinks, such as cola, a day were more than twice as likely to get into fights, compared with those who drank other beverages (file picture) Although the potential dangers of the popular drinks have been much researched, this study is one of the first to look at such young children. The US researchers said that limiting the number of colas, lemonades and other soft drinks given to a child – or even banning them all together – may improve behaviour. The team from Columbia University in New York asked mothers of five-year-olds how often their children had fizzy drinks. The women also filled in a questionnaire about how their child had behaved in the previous two months. Almost half of the 3,000 boys and girls had at least one soft drink a day. One in 25 had four or more, the Journal of Pediatrics reports. The children studied were part of a larger project involving ‘fragile families’ – families deemed to be at greater risk of break-up and poverty than normal. However, the link with aggression was ‘strong and consistent’, even when factors such as the number of sweets eaten, socio-economic status, domestic violence and the mother’s mental health were taken into account. Researcher Shakira Suglia said that she was not able to prove that the soft drinks were making the children violent. For instance, it is possible that health problems that make children aggressive or moody could also create cravings for sugary drinks. However, she said that cutting down on consumption, or stopping it all together, may improve behaviour. Guidance: Sarah Schenker, of the British Dietetic Association, whose own children have never had a fizzy drink, recommends children are given milk or water . If soft drinks are to blame, the problem could lie in their sugar content.  A can of Coca-Cola contains almost nine teaspoons of sugar. Caffeine, found in many soft drinks, may also affect children’s behaviour. The soft drinks enjoyed by millions of Britons every day have been linked to a host of health problems, including heart attacks, diabetes, weight gain, brittle bones, pancreatic and prostate cancer, muscle weakness and paralysis. The health and food campaign group . Sustain wants a sugary drinks tax to be brought in and the proceeds . ploughed back into children’s health. 'This study adds to the overwhelming body of evidence that sugary drinks damage children’s health and well-being by contributing to dental diseases, obesity and bad behaviour' Charlie Powell, Sustain . The campaign’s director Charlie Powell said: ‘This study adds to the overwhelming body of evidence that sugary drinks damage children’s health and well-being by contributing to dental diseases, obesity and bad behaviour.’ Sarah Schenker, of the British Dietetic Association, said that soft drinks are nutritionally very poor and drinking them at the age of five could put a child on slippery slope towards a lifetime of fast and processed foods. Dr Schenker, whose own children have never had a fizzy drink, recommends children are given milk or water.  Fruit juice can also be drunk but in small amounts. The food industry stressed that the study had not proved the soft drinks were the cause of children’s problems and that a bad diet or lack of exercise could be to blame. Gavin Partington, the British Soft Drinks Association’s director-general, said: ‘Parents should be careful to make sure that their children have a balanced diet and plenty of physical activity.’ Earlier this summer, obesity experts accused the food industry of devising a ‘master plan’ to fool people - and governments - into believing sugar-laden fizzy drinks are healthier than they are. The European Congress on Obesity heard evidence that industry-funded studies were more likely to conclude that soft drinks did not have a major role in obesity - even though separate analysis of similar data found the opposite.","Sugar-laden drinks linked with moodiness and trouble concentrating .

She's the academic who has outed online trolls and faced a barrage of criticism about her looks. Now classicist Mary Beard has a new fight on her hands - the battle to take back control of history programmes to the experts, rather than celebrities. Prof Beard has written an article arguing that television history should be left to the experts who actually know what they're talking about - rather than well-meaning famous people who read their lines from an autocue. She doesn't want a complete ban on celebrities fronting such programmes - but does believe that viewers will benefit from people who have dedicated their lives to learning about the subject, rather than someone who knows barely more than the audience. In the History Matters section on the University of Sheffield website, she writes: 'We also need to claim – or keep – a place for specialists themselves, devising, writing and presenting programmes on what they really know about. 'All the evidence is that viewers appreciate being eyeball to eyeball with the expert. 'If people turn on a programme about Stalin’s policies in the 1930s, they like to know that they are hearing for the person who has worked on that half their lives, not someone reading lines from an autocue.' She wrote that while presenters like Joanna Lumley and Jeremy Clarkson are enthusiastic about the subject, they lack the knowledge to provide a truly enlightening experience for the audience. Viewers appreciate being eyeball to eyeball with the expert instead of with well meaning celebrities like Joanna Lumley and Jeremy Clarkson reading from an autocue, Prof Beard argues . Her demand for better-informed . presenters follows art critic Brian Sewell's call for experts, rather . than celebrities, flooding specialist subject programmes. He wrote: 'Too much TV is blighted by ever increasing vulgarity and ever lower intellectual levels. 'The first step of BBC programme-makers is to select a popular presenter, a supposedly safe pair of hands, who knows nothing of the subject, but is a friendly face. 'That friendly face then becomes the subject of the programme — it tells the tale of a journey into slight acquaintance with the subject, but offers no real sound basic knowledge of it. 'That friendly face will loom from the TV screen, obscuring the subject on which it delivers the drivel prepared for it by so-called researchers.' Prof Beard also used the piece to comment on all those who have focused on her looks, rather than her personality or learning, in reference to her television appearances. She explained that it would have been a cowardly decision to avoid television based on the potential criticism she would face from those who would cruelly focus on the fact that she was not as young as many of her female counterparts. She wrote: 'I guess that when I agreed to do some TV, I knew that things weren’t necessarily going to be easy for a late middle-aged woman, who looked the 50 something years she was. 'But it would have seemed cowardly (and decidedly un-sisterly) to be frightened off for that reason.'","Prof Beard says viewers prefer expert's opinion rather than a celebrity .

Judge John Lafferty had to adjourn sentence in a child porn case so a fully sighted colleague can view the material . Britain's only blind judge adjourned the sentencing of a pervert so that a sighted judge can decide how serious a child pornography video is. Judge John Lafferty told Snaresbrook Crown Court on Wednesday that as he couldn't view the video - showing a woman having sex with a boy - he couldn't rule how 'serious' it was. The court heard defendant Philip Hawkins was arrested on January 15 this year after police found child pornography on his laptop at his home in Stepney, east London. The 63-year-old, who has previous convictions for child abduction and taking indecent photos of children, was put on the Sex Offenders Register in 2008 after being found guilty of indecently assaulting an 11-year-old boy at a swimming pool. During a routine police check on Hawkins in January, however, officers found a video of a woman having sex with a boy on his laptop and he was arrested for breaching the conditions of his release imposed five years ago. Judge Lafferty, however, was unable to judge which of the five categories of seriousness the video fell into, so adjourned sentencing of the case to allow a fully-sighted judge to decide. He told the court: 'There is clearly what appears to be sexual intercourse between a boy and a woman. 'In my judgement there is a very clear impression that sexual intercourse is going on between the seductress and the boy. Snaresbrook Crown Court heard that officers found a video of a woman having sex with a boy on his laptop . 'There is no clear evidence of penetration and the soundtrack does not help. 'Therefore I have to decide whether I am prepared to draw the conclusion whether it is sexual intercourse between a boy and a woman. 'It is not the grossest form of level four depictions that one could imagine. 'However, I am happy to allow a judge who can more aptly see the video to pass sentence and decide which category this falls in to.' Hawkins will now be sentenced on September 11 this year.","Judge John Lafferty told Snaresbrook Crown Court he couldn't view a video .

A young cricketer has made history by bowling over her male teammates after becoming the first female to play in a league after 125 years. Chloe Wallwork entered the record books with her maiden appearance as a first team player in the Bolton Association - Lancashire's oldest league. And not only did the 20-year-old make her first team debut for Walshaw but she took four wickets in 11 overs - including four maidens - helping her teammates to a resounding victory over Golborne. Chloe gets a mixed reaction from opposing male players - who either try to hit her for six or do everything within their power to avoid being bowled out by a woman . However, despite breaking down the boundaries Chloe, who also plays for Lancashire's women's team, has taken it all in her stride. She said: 'I didn't even know that I was the first girl to play first-team cricket in the league for 125 years until I read about it. 'Growing up, I was the only girl to play cricket. The rest of the girls I knew were talking about boys.' Chloe first picked up a bat and ball aged five, playing in the street with her brother Ryan, now aged 24. In her first team debut the 20-year-old took four wickets in 11 overs - including four maidens - helping her teammates to a resounding victory . She started playing for Walshaw three . years later. Within a year, she was scouted by Lancashire, and has since . been on tour twice to South Africa with the women's team.

And she gets a mixed reaction from opposing male players - who either try to hit her for six or do everything within their power to avoid being bowled out by a woman. Chloe added: 'When everyone sees me coming out they have a bit of a laugh, but I'm used to that because I've always been the only girl in the team. 'When I'm bowling against them they either try to slog me or block me because they don't want to get out to a girl.' It is not just cricket Chloe loves - she spends each night of the week doing some form of sport. She said: 'I play for Walshaw on Tuesdays, Lancs on Thursdays, and I also play rounders on Mondays and football on Wednesdays. 'Then there's the cricket matches on the weekend. Sometimes I do ache but it's worth it.' Coach Darren Foy has tipped her for more first-team action. 'She asked me if I'd give her a chance and I'm glad I did,' he said. 'She'll probably get a few more games on the strength of what she did on Saturday. 'She bowled well, she's a good fielder, and when she's bowling she's not scared of giving the fielders a bit of a rocketing.' David Leach, chairman at Walshaw, added: 'Chloe has played here since she was a youngster and has come up through the junior teams up to the second team and she took her chance at the weekend. 'She's constantly proving herself and was more than a match for the others in the game. She's a great girl and very competitive and always gives the lads a hard time.'","Chloe Wallwork is a first team player in the Bolton Association .

The UK has joined forces with Germany, Austria and the Netherlands for the right to block EU migrants from claiming welfare payments. The European Commission took Britain to court earlier this year for restricting some state handouts, including child benefit and Jobseeker’s Allowance, to EU nationals on the grounds that the restrictions breach the rules on the free movement of people.

The . effort has acquired greater urgency since German Chancellor Angela .

In a major boost for the Prime Minister, Mrs Merkel said: ‘We don’t have to do everything in Brussels.’She signalled that she wants negotiations to begin after next month’s German general election. The European Commission took Britain to court this year for restricting some state handouts, including jobseeker's allowance, to EU nationals on the grounds that the restrictions breach the rules on the free movement of people .

Obama campaign fundraiser Matthew Barzun, who was sworn into his new role yesterday, insists the United States and United Kingdom are 'best friends'. But speaking at a Senate confirmation hearing hearing, he made clear he will use his role in London to urge David Cameron not to sever ties with Brussels. He said: 'The US interest is, as the president said, for a strong UK voice in a strong EU.' The 42-year-old was US ambassador to Sweden but left to work as a citizen fundraiser on Barack Obama's re-election campaign in 2011. Work and .

Mats Persson, Director of the Open Europe think tank, which has been working with the Foreign Office to draw up plans for the renegotiation with the EU, said: ‘Mr Cameron has already built a powerful coalition in Europe, including Germany, in favour of revising these rules. 'The Prime Minister this autumn has a big opportunity to push various pro-competitiveness reforms, including scrapping growth-destroying EU regulations and go for more single market liberalisation.’ A senior Tory source told The Times: '“The original interpretation of the EU directive was kept deliberately vague to allow member states to decide what to do. 'Now the European Commission is trying to impose an interpretation we disagree with. We want to take back the power to decide what to do and believe we are making headway.' A business task force, chaired by Business Minister Michael Fallon, which is also examining what the new deal with Europe should look like, is also expected to report back ahead of an EU summit in October, the first time the leaders of all 28 member states will be together after the German elections.

An 18-year-old accused of killing a bicyclist with his car has had a vehicular manslaughter charge upgraded to murder in part because he had previously boasted about speeding on Twitter. prosecutors said Thursday. Cody Hall, of Pleasanton, was being held without bail after he was charged Wednesday with the murder of 58-year-old Diana Hersevoort. Hall was going more than 80 mph in a 40 mph zone when he hit Hersevoort and her husband along a busy boulevard in Dublin on June 9, prosecutors allege. Hersevoort's husband only broke an arm, but she was killed. 'Death Ride': Cody Hall used Twitter to brag about how fast he drove before fatally hitting a woman on a bicycle . Fateful tweet: One of Cody Hall's tweets boasting about his driving . Hall reportedly stopped at the scene and was cooperative with police. An analysis of Hall's driving record, along with Twitter posts in which he discussed how fast he liked to drive, persuaded prosecutors to change the charge to murder, the Alameda County district attorney's office said. A Twitter account apparently belonging to Hall is now restricted from public view, but local media outlets have posted screen grabs of an account that apparently belongs to Hall, where he asks his Twitter followers if they want to go for a 'death ride' with him. In other posts, he wrote things like 'drive fast live young,' and posted photos of his speedometer clocking high speeds. Brian Welch, a supervisor of the homicide unit at the Santa Clara County district attorney's office who is not involved in this case, told the Oakland Tribune that in most circumstances, fatal crashes result in murder charges when the suspect was recklessly fleeing police or was a drunken driver with previous convictions, not because of something like a Twitter feed. Welch said in this case it is likely the tweets will serve as what's called a 'pre-offense statement,' often an email, handwritten note or text message, used to bolster prosecutors' attempt to prove malice. 'The challenge in these situations is proving that your defendant is the person who posted the statement,"" he said. People who know Hall describe him as a hard-working kid who loves animals. Victim: Diana Hersevoort was on a bike ride with her husband when she was hit by Cody Hall, who was driving twice the legal speed limit . 'I am saying he isn't a devil or a deliberate murderer, he made a . horrific, terrible mistake and he will pay, I, personally will not hang . him out to dry or vilify him, he will suffer enough by the natural . consequences of his actions, a commenter who uses the handle Cr commented on a story about Hall on the Pleasanton Patch. Another commenter with the handle 'ken mo' wrote that 'As reckless and inexcusable as this young man's actions were, please . keep in mind he did not go out on the road that day planning to kill . someone, it was a complete accident. His actions have horrific . consequences and he will have to pay. But to all of you who continue to . denounce him I don't think you realize this could have easily been your . own kid. It was a stupid teenage mistake that SO many high schoolers . make, many just luck out and never hurt anyone.' Halls father, Aaron Hall - a twice-convicted felon - was arrested on several felony counts on July 11, when police were serving a search warrant at his house related to his son's collision and found illegal assault rifles and thousands of rounds of ammunition.","Cody Hall was going more than twice the legal speed limit when he fatally struck bicyclist Diana Hersevoort .

A professor has claimed that Harry Potter (played by Daniel Radcliffe, pictured) is partly responsible for Barack Obama being elected as US President . A political science professor has claimed Harry Potter is partly responsible for Barack Obama being elected as U.S. President. Professor Anthony Gierzynski believes the moral tales found in the best-selling books 'played a small but not insignificant role' in influencing voters in both elections in 2009 and 2012. He argues that fans took on-board key themes in the novels, including lessons of tolerance and diversity, which made President Obama and the Democratic Party appeal to them more than the Republican Party. Professor Gierzynski, at the University of Vermont, claims J.K. Rowling's epic tale of an orphaned wizard who battles evil at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry also had some sway on who lives at the White House. He said: 'The lessons fans internalised about . tolerance, diversity, violence, torture, skepticism and authority, made . the Democratic Party and Barack Obama more appealing to fans of Harry . Potter in the current political environment,' Medical Daily reported. The professor said Millennials, who are born from the early 1980s to the early 2000s and comprise the core of J.K. Rowling's fan base, were so taken with the novels' moralistic themes it influenced their political persuasion. The research is presented in Professor Gierzynski's latest book, called Harry Potter and the Millennials: Research Methods and the Politics of the Muggle Generation. Professor Gierzynskiargues said fans absorbed key themes in the book, including lessons of tolerance and diversity, which made President Obama (pictured) and the Democratic Party appeal to them more than the opposition . His study looked at the voting habits of 1,000 college students born after 1980 and found 60 per cent of students who had read the book said they voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 Presidential election. Furthermore, 83 percent of those surveyed had negative views of former President George W. Bush. The scientist believes the book's ability to portray good and evil in two relatively distinct sets had an impact on reader's ethical values and political persuasion. The villains of the novels are clearly set out so it is not difficult for readers to know who to side with, according to Professor Gierzynski, who believes a type of moral inflation is seeded in readers, who later support immigration reform and marriage equality, for example. The professor said Millennials, who are born from the early 1980s to the early 2000s and comprise the core of J.K. Rowling's fan base, were so taken with the novels' moralistic themes it influenced their political persuasion. Characters Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley are pictured . He said: 'Attitudes in opposition to the use of . violence, torture and deadly force came to be associated with the . Democrats at the end of the Bush years, mainly in opposition to Bush . administration policies and failures in these areas . 'The opposition to equal marital rights . for same-sex couples and immigration reform by the Republicans put those . who support political tolerance…and those who are more accepting of . diversity on the side of the Democrats.' He advised Republicans hoping to win back the minds of young voters to move away from the right-wing side of their party.","Anthony Gierzynski believes the moral novels 'played a small but not insignificant role' in influencing voters in both elections in 2009 and 2012 .

Facebook is working on a pilot system which could rival PayPal by allowing users to make mobile purchases using their log-in details. The world’s largest social networking company confirmed plans to test the new service which would reportedly enable shoppers to buy online without entering their credit card details each time. The system would work by automatically filling in forms with the payment details added by users to their Facebook account whenever they make purchases on mobile applications. Facebook, world's largest social networking company, has confirmed plans to test the new service which would reportedly enable shoppers to buy online without entering their credit card details each time . It is said to have partnered with a men's shopping site, Jackthreads, for the pilot. Facebook could find itself pitted against PayPal if the testing phase proves successful. The site would not expand on its plans but it is said to be focused on improving the mobile checkout experience. It added that it would not be involved in payment processing which would remain with retail apps’ current service providers. The system would work by automatically filling in forms using payment details added by users to their Facebook account whenever they make purchases on mobile applications . Facebook reported an increase in its second quarter revenue soar to 1.813 billion dollars (£1.18 billion) - a 53% increase on 1.184 billion dollars (£770 million) in the same period last year. The social network's stock has returned a mediocre performance since the company went public in May 2012, but yesterday its value jumped 20 per cent to $31.81 during after-hours trading. Facebook made $333m in net income from April to June compared with a net loss of $157m a year ago, according to the company's latest financial results. An average of 699 million people used the social media platform every day in June, it said, an increase of 27 per cent on the same time last year. The number of monthly users accessing Facebook on mobile devices - including smartphones and tablets - rose by 51 per cent year on year to 819 million in June. According to tech website All Things D, the payment service would still allow companies partnering with Facebook to work with their chosen payment processors. ‘If eventually expanded to more partners, the product would also potentially give Facebook keen insight into the shopping habits and preferences of the company's users, a lucrative set of data for the world's largest social network to gather,’ All Things D said. An average of 699 million people used Facebook every day in June, an increase of 27 per cent on the same time last year. If the site does roll out the payment feature, it will have valuable data about how many of its users purchased items from partner applications and better target advertisement. The social networking group has already promised a shift away from its ‘Credits’ system to introduce local currency payments - expected by September 12. This aims to simplify the purchase experience for users and make it easier for developers to price virtual goods for a global audience. ‘Since we introduced Credits in 2009, most games on Facebook have implemented their own virtual currencies, reducing the need for a platform-wide virtual currency, ‘ the site said when it introduced that system. Whether or not users would trust a social networking site with their financial information remains to be seen. As well as concerns over Facebook privacy, Jean-Noel Georges, a Frost & Sullivan ICT director, said that more needs to be done to secure mobile devices if payments are to be made . ‘As a result, we are updating Facebook Payments to support pricing in local currency instead of Credits.’ Whether or not users would trust a social networking site with their financial information remains to be seen. The group has recently come under fire for a Graph Search feature which it has rolled out to its US English-speaking users, enabling them to find out specific details about their friends. Some people believe the feature is an invasion of privacy as it unearths old photos and details that would otherwise have been hard to find.

Threats: Isabel, seven, and sister Ellie-Louise Cox, four (back row) with their three-year-old neighbour Caidence Leadbetter who have been threatened with Asbos . The parents of three young children are furious they have been given an 'intimidating' police letter for playing outside. The letter, written by a police community support officer, highlighted alleged ‘anti-social behaviour’ near homes in Smiths Wood, Solihill. Parents of Ellie-Louise Cox, four, and her sister Isabel, seven, believe the police were referring to their children as well as neighbour Caidence Leadbetter, who is just three years old. The letters said elderly neighbours had complained of 'minor damage' to trees, the 'trampling of plants' and 'slightly intimidating behaviour'. Angry mother Claire Cox, 30, said: 'I'm totally shocked. 'The reason I know the letter is aimed at them is because they are the only children in the area who play in front of the houses. 'There are other older children who live nearby, but they do not play near here. The older ones go to the local park.' While Caidence's mother, Kelly, felt her daughter, who does not start primary school for another year, had been branded 'a yob'. She said: 'Caidence plays outside our home but she's never caused any trouble. She's the sweetest little girl you could hope for. 'I can't believe the police are basically accusing her of being some kind of anti-social yob. It's madness.' The letters were sent by a PCSO from Solihull Police to, who stated: 'Reports have been received about a rise in anti-social behaviour. 'It is understood that children like to play outdoors, however this has been observed to extend to minor damage to nearby trees and trampling of plants underfoot. Playful: Isabel (left), seven, and Ellie-Louise Cox (right), four, with their neighbour Caidence Leadbetter (centre) who is just three years old hold the Asbo warning letter . 'This is not an ideal situation and is perceived as slightly intimidating to elderly neighbours to see any large groups of children congregating. 'If any subsequent damage is identified it may well be the case that Solihull Council will be informed and indeed may act accordingly.' Mrs Cox said she was stunned by the letter as most of her elderly neighbours enjoyed listening to the little children playing outside. She added: 'I'm lucky I live in a road where they can safely play outside and I encourage them to play out as much as possible. The children pictured with their parents Claire and Daniel Cox and Kelly Johnson (far right) 'During the school term they go out between 4pm and 5pm and during the holidays they go out at about 11am. 'I don't want them sat in the house all day watching TV. I would like to know who they can possibly intimidate in the area? 'I realise now that they were not going to face Asbo orders, but when you get a letter like that coming through your door, from the police, it scares you. 'There are a lot of elderly people who live nearby, but there are no problems with most of them. 'In fact, I think they like to hear the sound of children playing outside.' According to West Midlands Police, the letter was sent out to everyone in the area. Superintendent Kevin Doyle, who is in charge of policing in Solihull, said: 'The neighbourhood police letter was a general reminder about anti-social behaviour; it was not aimed at any family in particular. 'There was no mention of Asbos in the letter and, legally, we cannot issue the orders to anyone under 10-years-old' He added: ‘West Midlands Police take anti-social behaviour very seriously because of the negative impact it can have on our communities. Parents Kelly Johnson (back left) and Claire Cox (back right) claim the children have done nothing wrong . 'That said, we certainly don’t want . to stop children from enjoying the outdoors particularly during the . summer months - but when we get reports of anti social behaviour from . residents we understandably must act.' The letters were sent just a week after the Mail revealed that children in Kings Heath had reclaimed three streets from traffic to mark National Play Day. The event, last Wednesday, mimicked a pioneering scheme from Bristol where parents apply for licenses for regular street closures to encourage kids to play out.","Parents of Isabel Cox, seven, and her sister Ellie-Louise Cox, four, were sent letters from police .
