"(CNN) -- Just in case you had any lingering illusions that politics deals with substantial issues, here's the issue that last week filled our media chatter: . Which is worse - to put a dog on the roof of a fast-moving car or to eat dog-meat as food? As you probably know, the Romney campaign has been battered for months by a story about a family vacation in the 1980s. Mitt Romney, driving his family of five boys to summer vacation in Canada, had improvised a dog cage atop the family car. He wrapped the dog cage in plexiglass to form a windbreak. The idea did not work. Â The dog fouled its cage and later ran away. One of Romney's sons laughingly repeated the story to a reporter years later, and ever since it has become Exhibit A in the case against Mitt Romney. Weary of this ridiculous line of attack, somebody on the Romney campaign dug out an extract from Barack Obama's memoir, ""Dreams From My Father"", published in 1995. In that book, Obama recalls that his Indonesian stepfather introduced him as a boy to the local cuisine, which included dog, snake and grasshoppers. This fact, in print for almost two decades, was dusted off last week as a new revelation in the Daily Caller website. Talk radio and conservative blogs seized on the theme. Twitter memes proliferated: #ObamaDogRecipes, #ObamaEatsDog, etc. The line between journalism and gossip is always thin and poorly marked. When journalists cross that line, as they so often do, they invoke ""larger meanings"" exposed by the titillating story of the moment. Thus, the ""larger meaning"" supposedly exposed by the dog-on-the-roof story: Romney is a heartless technocrat, ready to conduct brutal experiments on unsuspecting people or beasts and who only laughs if the experiment does not go well for the subject/victim. And thus too the ""larger meaning"" seen by partisans inside the Obama-eats-dog story: Obama is an alien, raised in alienation from basic American values, and protected by a complicit news media that refuses to report embarrassing facts about him - like dog-eating. As the scare quotes above suggest, I don't buy either of these supposed ""larger meanings."" Romney's biography shows many, many examples of decency, compassion, and human concern. Many are told in the outstanding biography by Michael Kranish and Scott Helman, including the most notable: In 1996, the teenage daughter of one of Romney's Bain Capital partners went missing after sneaking out to a rave party in New York City and ingesting the drug Ecstasy. Romney closed the firm and led every member in a search for the girl, finding and rescuing her. Likewise, you wouldn't think there'd be much scope to doubt the Americanism of one who bets his presidency on a mission to kill Osama bin Laden face to face rather than by the less risky means of a drone strike. Anyway, a lot of 100% Americans have eaten exotic foods. Teddy Roosevelt favorably compared the flesh of young bears to the taste of pork. My friend in the Special Forces boasts proudly: . ""'Snake Eaters' is a military slang term for Army Special Force (aka ""Green Berets""), and YES we DO eat snakes. This is part of our survival training, although I have slayed and eaten snake in the field to supplement the rations, and because basically, snake tastes good. ""I have encountered snakes (and eaten them) throughout my career. I have eaten cobra in Thailand (and drank the blood mixed with Mekhong whiskey), Eastern Diamondback in Mississippi and copperhead North Carolina. For what it's worth, I prefer rattlesnake; tastes like chicken."" Yet I think there actually is a ""larger meaning"" inherent in these dog stories - just not the meanings that the partisans want us to see. The true larger meaning is that 2012 will be a contest between two candidates with weak grips on their base voters. The hard right suspects Romney values competence more than ideology. The Democratic left is unhappy that Barack Obama won't propose massive New Deal-style job creation and wealth redistribution. To corral unexcited base voters, both campaigns must rely less on positive messaging (what can they say?) and much more on galvanizing dislike and antipathy of ""the other side."" The dueling dog stories do that job perfectly. Which is why you'll keep hearing about them through the long weeks of electioneering ahead. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Romney has been criticized over transporting his dog on car roof .

"(CNN) -- The Florida A&M University marching band will remain on suspension through the 2012-2013 academic year while the school works to set new rules following the fatal hazing of a band member, university President James Ammons said in a conference call Monday with trustees. ""I was heavily influenced by the need to be respectful to Robert Champion's family as well as the other victims,"" Ammons said. ""A young man lost his life, and others suffered serious injuries."" Authorities say Champion, 26, was badly beaten during a hazing incident on a band bus after a football game in Orlando last November. He died within an hour of the attack. Other hazing incidents that resulted in injuries to band members also have been reported. Ammons said the band must be restructured, and the ""limited time frame"" between now and autumn is not enough time to accomplish that. While the band will not perform until 2013 at the earliest, school officials will present their plan for reinstating the band at the June meeting of trustees, he said. Champion's father, Robert Champion Sr., said, ""Any step forward to end hazing will help."" Trustees who spoke on the conference call supported Ammons' decision. ""We need to ensure that excellence and respect is achieved not through brutality, but through honorable academic, talent-based achievement and leadership,"" trustee Belinda Reed Shannon said. Trustee Kelvin Lawson called the announcement ""absolutely the right decision at the right time."" The decision to continue the band's indefinite suspension comes the week after director Julian White, who had been with the prestigious band for 40 years, stepped down under pressure. He was placed on paid administrative leave shortly after the hazing death of Champion, a FAMU Marching 100 drum major. As recently as last week, White, 71, had asked for full reinstatement as director. His attorney, Chuck Hobbs, said last week that White had tried to root out hazing for the past 22 years. White's resignation last week came days after Ammons told the trustees in a letter that about 100 band members were not enrolled at the school during the fall, CNN affiliate WCTV reported. Of the ineligible band members, 51 of them and one cheerleader made the fateful trip to Orlando. All received a daily allowance for expenses. ""We are looking into per diems claimed by individuals as part of the band trips,"" Gretl Plessinger of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement told WCTV. The ritual that led to Champion's death, called ""Crossing Bus C,"" is an initiation process in which pledges attempt to move down the center aisle of a bus while senior members assault them, according to some university band members. An autopsy found ""extensive contusions of (Champion's) chest, arms, shoulder and back,"" and ""evidence of crushing of areas of subcutaneous fat."" Thirteen people have been charged in connection with Champion's death. Eleven are facing felony hazing charges, and two others are charged with misdemeanor hazing. On Monday, one of the students charged in Champion's death has agreed to accept a plea deal in connection with the hazing of another student, according to his lawyer. Student Aaron Golson will enter a plea Thursday on a misdemeanor battery charge in the hazing of student Bria Hunter, Golson's atorney, Craig J. Brown said. The charges are separate from the felony hazing accusations Golson faces in Champion's death, Brown said. His client will fight those charges, he said. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement also is investigating ""financial irregularities"" involving the band. Champion's death prompted the university board of trustees to approve an anti-hazing plan that includes an independent panel of experts to investigate. The death brought renewed public scrutiny to hazing, which some students have contended has gone on for years despite what the Tallahassee university said were efforts to stop it. The band has been under suspension following the incident and the resulting investigations. Champion's mother, Pam, has called for it to be disbanded. ""They need to clean out the filth to move forward. How can they allow the band out there?"" she said last week. ""They haven't done anything to safeguard students -- certainly not my son. My son was murdered."" In the letter last week to trustees, Ammons said he wanted to hear the opinions of student leaders, alumni, boosters and other groups about what they thought needed to happen before the marching band could be reinstated. ""A common theme among all of the groups is that a new set of guidelines should be in place before reinstating the band,"" Ammons said. Before the announcement of the decision, University System Chancellor Frank Brogan had argued against reinstatement, saying too many questions remain. ""Reinstating the band prior to these issues being resolved would sidestep efforts under way, which could impact the band's long-term survival,"" Brogan said in his response to Ammons' letter. ""Reconciling these and other issues under investigation will ensure that the institution's operational priorities and controls are in place."" The school is working on a plan to provide entertainment during home football games, as well as at two ""classics"" events at which the Marching 100 has been a fixture, Ammons said. Despite its name, the band has about 420 members, according to the school. It was not immediately clear what impact the decision would have on band members attending the school on a band scholarship. Ammons noted that band scholarships require students to perform publicly in addition to classwork, and all bands featuring Marching 100 members have been suspended. But he said other bands and ensembles that do not have marching band members on their rosters will be allowed to continue to perform. Throughout the school's history, the Marching 100, which incorporates dance moves into traditional marching formations, has been a source of pride for the school. It has played in inaugural parades for Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and in several Super Bowls. In 1985, the band won The Louis Sudler Intercollegiate Marching Band Trophy, awarded annually by the John Philip Sousa Foundation to ""collegiate marching bands of particular excellence."" The band's website bills the Marching 100 as ""The Most Imitated Marching Band in America.""","NEW: Band member to accept plea deal in another hazing case, lawyer says .

"London (CNN) -- The Dutch women's beach volleyball team sailed through Heathrow airport as it arrived in London for the Olympic Games, but not every athlete had such a smooth arrival. American hurdler Kerron Clement's bus got lost on the way from the airport to the Olympic village, he said, resulting in a four-hour-plus journey. ""Athletes are sleepy, hungry and need to pee. Could we get to the Olympic Village please,"" the world record holder said on Twitter on Monday. ""Not a good first impression London."" The drive should take about an hour. London's Olympic organizers, London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, said ""the vast majority"" of bus journeys had gone smoothly, but conceded that ""there may have been one or two journeys taking longer than expected."" Heathrow airport is expecting a record number of passengers on Monday as athletes begin to flood into the city for the Olympic Games, which start a week from Friday. Share your Olympics sights and sounds . The arrivals begin amid a security snafu, as the government prepares to call in 3,500 military personnel because the security contractor says it does not expect to have enough staff in place. G4S, the contractor, admitted last week that it would not be able to provide more than 10,000 security staffers by the time the Olympics begin. The staff were supposed to be doing tasks including venue perimeter security such as manning X-ray machines, searching people, searching vehicles, and operating closed-circuit television systems, G4S told CNN on Sunday. Home Secretary Theresa May, who is responsible for domestic security, was called to Parliament to answer questions from lawmakers on Monday after the fiasco. She insisted that G4S actually had more than 20,000 accredited security staff, and that until last week it appeared they would have too many contractors rather than too few. The Home Office told CNN earlier on Monday that the contractor was suffering from a software problem which meant they could not guarantee who would turn up where, and whether guards had the right training. G4S did not respond immediately to a CNN request for comment on the accusation. The Home Office also said that the extra immigration staff deployed at borders was properly trained, rejecting media reports to the contrary. Immigration desks will have extra staff, Heathrow said Monday, amid fears of long lines to get into the country. Retired border officials and retired police officers are among those being brought in to help immigration staff, the Home Office said. The airport expects nearly 237,000 people to fly in or out on Monday, about 25% more than on a normal day. The arrivals include 335 athletes, the airport said in a statement. Athlete arrivals are expected to peak on July 24, with more than 1,200 competitors due on that day. See how Heathrow is preparing for the London Olympics . Cubans, Italians and Russians were among the arrivals on Monday. Pressed about the security snafu, Sports Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Sunday it should be no surprise that some contractors were unable to meet their commitments. ""It's completely normal that you're going to find some contractors on a project of this size who aren't going to be able to deliver what they promised,"" he said on the BBC's ""The Andrew Marr Show."" He praised the contractor as being ""honorable"" for having admitted the problem, apologizing and covering the costs of bringing in military personnel. And he reiterated that the government learned only last week that G4S would not meet its commitment. ""Management told us right up until last week that everything was on track,"" Hunt said. The contractor said Saturday it stands to lose up to $77 million after failing to recruit enough staff. The airport, meanwhile, said Monday it is deploying more than 500 volunteers who speak 20 languages among them to welcome athletes and officials. The Games start on July 27.

"(CNN) -- Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has said millions of dollars from the ""extreme right wing"" in the United States helped oust him from government and derailed a peace plan with the Palestinians. In an exclusive interview aired Friday with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Olmert said his attempts to make peace had been ""a killer"" for him as prime minister. In 2008, Olmert sought a ""full comprehensive peace between us and the Palestinians"" -- a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders. But the plan was never realized and Olmert was forced from office accused of corruption, which he denies. ""It was a killer for me, not only because of the opposition in Israel. I think that, by the way, in Israel, the majority of the Israelis would have supported my plan, had it come for elections,"" Olmert said. ""But I had to fight against superior powers, including millions and millions of dollars that were transferred from this country (the United States) by figures which were from the extreme right wing that were aimed to topple me as prime minister of Israel. There is no question about it."" Pressed to name names, Olmert replied: ""Next time."" Asked if current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would be willing to propose such a plan, given the same political risks, Olmert said it was the responsibility of a leader to put his country first. ""That's why you are prime minister,"" said Olmert. ""That's why you take the responsibility of leadership. To do things which are right for the nation that you want to lead."" But Olmert acknowledged that such leadership comes at a price. ""I paid personally, dearly. But there was no option for me but to do what I did. And I know for sure, and I know the names, of the people that spent millions of dollars in order to stop me -- from the United States."" He was then asked if there is still time for a two-state solution. ""There is time,"" said Olmert, ""but time is running out."" He admits that Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority, never said yes to his 2008 proposal, but also insists that he never said no. ""So why not reintroduce this plan again, and present the challenge to the Palestinians?"" asked Olmert. He said he hoped his successor, Netanyahu, would adopt his peace proposal -- which included the division of Jerusalem, which both Israelis and Palestinians claim as their capital -- but that so far this had not happened. ""The fact is that we don't negotiate with the Palestinians. And the fact is that we have not proposed anything,"" he said. Olmert suggested the current Israeli government was content to blame the Palestinians for a reluctance to negotiate, rather than striving for a peace deal which is of great importance to Israel. ""We want peace. We need peace. We want to separate from the Palestinians,"" he said. ""We don't want to control the lives of the Palestinians. We want them to have their own separate state and we have to do everything in our power in order to bring it about."" Olmert said it broke his heart to propose the division of Jerusalem, which he served as mayor from 1993 to 2003. But the difficult decision was necessary, he said. ""For me to propose a division of Jerusalem was really terrible. I did it because I reached a conclusion that without which there will not be peace."" Asked if Netanyahu will seek such a peace, Olmert said, ""I certainly pray that he will."" Then he added, ""I doubt that he will."" Olmert was indicted on a variety of corruption charges in 2008 in a probe that dogged his last months in office. He held several Cabinet posts under then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who has been in a coma since a stroke in 2006. Olmert succeeded Sharon after his stroke. Olmert announced his resignation in September 2008, after the corruption investigation deepened, and left office after a new government took power in March 2009. Other corruption allegations have followed. Olmert declined to discuss the charges with CNN. He has denied wrongdoing in all cases.","Ehud Olmert says extreme right-wing elements in the United States helped derail his peace plan .

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- The mini-civil war that we've seen play out in the Democratic Party over the past few weeks isn't just a case of a dispute about tactics. It's a sign of a deeper division. Former President Bill Clinton, who has been campaigning for President Obama and taking on the GOP, went off-script several times. Soon after Obama rolled out his ads attacking Mitt Romney for his work at Bain Capital and then as Massachusetts governor, Clinton took issue with these kinds of attacks and extolled Romney's ""sterling business career."" A few days later, Clinton called for a temporary extension of President George W. Bush's tax cuts, including those for the wealthy, and then on Thursday said he was sorry for doing so. Video: Is Clinton undermining Obama? At some levels, the contrast in the views of Obama and Clinton is yet another chapter in the extraordinarily tense personal relations that began with the 2008 Democratic primaries, when then-Sen. Hillary Clinton competed with Obama. When some of Obama's supporters charged that Bill Clinton was subtly playing on racial tensions in the South Carolina primary to stir up white voters, the anger between the two camps intensified. But at another level, the debate between these two men is part of a bigger debate about what kind of campaign the Democrats should run: a campaign of articulation or a campaign of triangulation. What is Bill Clinton up to? The party is reaching a crossroads. With the economy in poor shape and most polls showing that this is an extremely close race, Democrats need to make some decisions about the basic themes they will develop in the next few months to define the fall contest. One strategy, which has been the preference thus far for President Obama, is a campaign of ""articulation,"" a campaign in which a candidate lays out a clear set of themes and ideas to distinguish himself from the opposition. This kind of campaign takes the offensive, touting the virtues of Democratic ideas and policies. Democrats have mostly avoided this approach in recent decades, still snake-bitten from the defeats in the Reagan Revolution of the 1980s. It is the kind of campaign that FDR ran in 1936, when he pushed back against conservatives and boasted about what Democratic programs had done to save middle-class Americans in the middle of the Great Depression. It is a campaign like that of 1964, when Lyndon Johnson painted Barry Goldwater as an extremist and championed programs like the War on Poverty as shining examples of what the Democrats offered in contrast. On the other side of the aisle, Ronald Reagan ran this kind of campaign in 1980, when he stood by the ideals of conservatism, insisting that the right offered a better path forward for a broken nation. The other kind of campaign, the campaign of ""triangulation,"" is one that Bill Clinton mastered in 1996. Triangulation is a term popularized by Clinton adviser Dick Morris to describe a politician who stands above traditional left-right divisions and co-opts the arguments of the opposition. ""The essence of triangulation is to use your party's solutions to solve the other side's problems,"" he said, ""Use your tools to fix their car."" This was the kind of campaign Obama has always promised voters he would not run. The campaign of triangulation seeks to lessen the policy space between the two parties by minimizing many key differences and focusing voter attention on the personality and appeal of the candidate. Jimmy Carter was one of the Democrats who mastered this strategy. In 1976, he sidestepped some traditionally controversial issues such as civil rights and economic policy and instead depicted himself as a deficit-cutting moderate who was not like his elders in the Democratic Party. He focused on his personality, his background in Georgia and the argument that voters in the post-Watergate age could trust him. In 1996, Clinton perfected this kind of campaign. After Republicans had retaken the House and Senate in 1994, Clinton started the year of 1996 by saying the era of big government was over. He agreed to legislation that ended the existing welfare system and made deficit reduction his priority. In essence, he stole the mainstream part of the Republican agenda and made it his own. By the time the campaign was fully under way, he could concentrate on his youth and charisma, particularly when he compared himself with the much older Republican Sen. Robert Dole and highlight the areas that made the GOP look extreme, like their push for dramatic cuts in the Medicare program. The strong temptation for Obama will be to move closer toward the model of triangulation, especially given the stalling economy and after Republicans scored a major victory in Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's recall campaign. Obama understands that the danger of a campaign of articulation is that he would not be able to capitalize on the issues that convince many moderates to go to or stick with the Republican Party. But Obama needs to offer voters a choice. The danger of triangulation is that it dampens the enthusiasm of base supporters who are needed to help raise money and bring out the vote. They are the organizers, the mobilizers and the rank-and-file who can make sure that in a close election, more Democrats come out to vote. And a candidate who can't triangulate as skillfully as Clinton did could only end up legitimating the arguments of his opponent and leaving voters to wonder why they don't just go for the ""real thing."" This does not mean Obama has to run as a ""left-wing"" Democrat, nor does he have to stick to attacks on Bain Capital, which don't seem to be working. But he does need a message, and he does need a coherent theme that goes beyond slight differences with the GOP. Obama's best bet is to stick with a campaign in which he focuses on defining a Democratic set of principles and offering voters a reason why his party would be better over the next four years, especially on the economy. If he does not, and he takes the triangulation bait, Obama could end up becoming a surrogate for the Romney campaign. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: Bill Clinton won re-election by blurring differences with GOP .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The International Committee of the Red Cross said Thursday it was suspending its work in Pakistan pending a review of its presence in the South Asian country. The decision comes after the killing of Khalil Rasjed Dale, a 60-year old health program manager who was abducted four months ago in Balochistan. His body was found last month. The 900 national staff members of the Red Cross have been placed on paid leave, and 80 foreign staffers have been flown to Islamabad, said spokesman Christian Cardon. ""Over the last few years unfortunately, it has become very dangerous not only in Pakistan but all over the world with the ICRC staff being targeted and coming under attack,"" Cardon said. Jacques de Maio, the head of Red Cross operations for South Asia, said the aid agency was compelled to ""completely reassess the balance between the humanitarian impact of our activities and the risks faced by our staff."" The organization has halted all all its activities and said it was painfully aware of the consequences on the wounded, sick and other vulnerable people. The Red Cross has been working in Pakistan since the country's independence in 1947, providing health care, physical rehabilitation and other assistance for victims of violence and natural disasters. It has been instrumental in aid delivery after earthquakes and the devastating 2010 flooding across the nation. The agency called Dale a ""trusted and very experienced Red Cross staff member who significantly contributed to the humanitarian cause."" He had been working in the western city of Quetta and the province of Balochistan for almost a year. Armed men abducted him January 5 as he was returning home from work. ""This is an abhorrent act targeted against a committed humanitarian worker who has dedicated himself and his life to help others in need,"" said Aine Fay, head of the Pakistan Humanitarian Forum, a coalition of aid agencies. The forum said Dale's killing was the latest incident in a long line of targeted attacks against humanitarian agencies and staff. The past four years has seen an increase in targeted attacks against national and international humanitarian organizations and staff across Pakistan by violent militant groups and criminals. ""To date none of the perpetrators have been captured or brought to justice, and, at this time seven humanitarian staff continue to be held hostage following their abductions in 2011 and 2012,"" the forum said. ""This picture of violence against humanitarian organizations and staff is reflective of the violence that has been inflicted on hundreds of innocent people by militants and criminals across Pakistan in the same period,"" it said. The forum called on Pakistan's government to condemn such acts of violence and do more to protect aid workers. CNN's Moni Basu and Aliza Kassim contributed to this report.","Red Cross worker Khalil Rasjed Dale was abducted and killed .

"(CNN) -- Racial profiling ""should be a hate crime investigated by the FBI,"" filmmaker Tyler Perry wrote in a Facebook posting Sunday in which he described his own tense encounter with police. ""It was so hostile,"" Perry, who is African-American, wrote. ""I was so confused. It was happening so fast that I could easily see how this situation could get out of hand very quickly. I didn't feel safe at all."" Perry, one of America's most successful film and television producers, said ""although we have made significant strides with racial profiling in this country, the world needs to know that we are still being racially profiled."" His posting, which has drawn more than 101,000 ""likes"" and 18,426 comments, told what happened when two white police officers stopped him while driving from his southwest Atlanta movie studio last month. Perry has directed and acted in at least 16 feature films. But his movies are most popular among African-American audiences and Perry is often dressed in drag as his ""Madea"" character. The misunderstanding and tension described by Perry suggests that the two white officers did not recognize Perry as one of Atlanta's richest and best-known citizens. It happened ""a few days"" before Perry hosted President Barack Obama at his studio on March 17, he said. Obama was in Atlanta that day to campaign and attend fundraisers. ""Most times when I leave the studio I have an unmarked escort,"" Perry wrote. ""Other times I constantly check in my rearview mirror to be sure that I'm not being followed. It's a safety precaution that my security team taught me."" Police pulled him over after he made a left turn from the right lane, he said. It was an illegal turn, the officer told him. ""I signaled to get into the turning lane, then made the turn because I have to be sure I'm not being followed,"" Perry said he told the officer. ""Why do you think someone would be following you?"" the officer, standing at his driver's door, asked. He then heard ""a hard banging"" on his passenger-side window, Perry wrote. ""I had never been in this position before so I asked the officer who was at my window what was going on and why is someone banging on the window like that,"" Perry wrote. ""Let your window down, let your window down. Your windows are tinted,"" he said the officer told him. When Perry lowered the passenger window he saw a second officer standing there. ""What is wrong with you?"" that officer said. ""He thinks he's being followed,"" the first officer said. ""Why do you think someone is following you?"" asked the other. ""What is wrong with you?"" The officer on the driver's side then reached into the car ""pulling on the switch that turns the car on and off,"" Perry said. ""Put your foot on the brake, put your foot on the brake!"" Perry said the officer commanded. ""I was so confused as to what he was doing, or what he thought he was doing,"" Perry wrote. ""It looked like he was trying to pull the switch out of the dashboard."" Perry wrote that he then realized the officer was trying to grab the key, which was not there. ""I reached down into the cup holder to get the key, not realizing that the key had a black leather strap on it,"" Perry wrote. ""As I grabbed it they both tensed up and I dropped it as I heard my mother's voice from when I was a little boy."" ""If you get stopped by the police, especially if they are white policemen, you say 'yes sir' and 'no sir', and if they want to take you in, you go with them,"" Perry said his mother often told him. ""Don't resist, you hear me? Don't make any quick moves, don't run, you just go."" ""It wasn't until after I heard her voice that I realized that both of these officers were white,"" he wrote. The first officer asked him again ""Why do you think someone is following you?"" ""I think you guys need to just write the ticket and do whatever you need to do,"" Perry said he told them. ""We may not let you go,"" the officer said. ""You think you're being followed, what's wrong with you?"" Another police cruiser pulled up after Perry stepped out of his car, he said. ""This officer was a black guy,"" Perry wrote. ""He took one look at me and had that 'Oh No' look on his face."" He was finally recognized. The black officer spoke ""in a hushed tone"" to the two white officers, he said. ""After that, one of the officers stayed near his car while one came back, very apologetic,"" Perry wrote. Perry did not identify the officers or specify which police department in the Atlanta metropolitan area they were from. Perry posed a question to his readers: ""Do you see how quickly this could have turned for the worse?"" ""Now I know that there are many great officers, patrolmen and security guys out there,"" wrote Perry, who employs a small army of his own security officers to guard his movie studio. He then made an apparent reference to the killing of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin, who was shot by a man who told police he feared for his life. ""I'm not sure how a murder in Florida can be protected by a 'stand your ground law,"" he wrote. Perry also raised the cases of two missing men -- one black and one Mexican -- last seen in the back of a deputy's patrol car in Naples, Florida, in 2004. Perry wrote that he has been ""screaming at the top of my lungs"" about the disappearances of Terrance Williams and Felipe Santos. ""They were never arrested, never brought to jail,"" Perry wrote. Perry finished his Facebook posting in all caps: ""RACIAL PROFILING SHOULD BE A HATE CRIME INVESTIGATED BY THE FBI!!!""","""It was so hostile,"" Perry says of a recent traffic stop .

"(CNN) -- For nearly two months, George Zimmerman has been largely a cipher, a riddle whose voice has been heard only in 911 calls reporting a young man acting ""real suspicious."" On Friday, the world learned more about Zimmerman as he, his wife and parents testified during a hearing in Sanford, Florida, to decide whether he would be released on bond while awaiting trial on a second-degree murder charge in the February 26 death of Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman's wife depicted him as a man she has never seen angry. His father said he was a truthful man who had long been concerned with helping others. And his mother said he had organized a campaign to ""get justice"" for a homeless man who had been beaten in Sanford, as well as mentoring a 14-year-old African-American boy from a dangerous Orlando neighborhood. Zimmerman has acknowledged killing Martin during an encounter in his Sanford neighborhood, saying he shot in self-defense. Critics have depicted the Hispanic neighborhood watch volunteer as a racist who profiled Martin because he was African-American. His family said nothing could be further from the truth. ""I know that he is very protective of people, very protective of homeless people and also of children"" -- regardless of their race, Gladys Zimmerman said in testimony meant to prove to Judge Kenneth Lester Jr. that Zimmerman would not be a threat to the community if allowed to leave jail while awaiting trial. She said he has been a mentoring the 14-year-old for three years even though the program he had joined shut down after only nine months because of the economy. She said she begged him not to go because of the danger. ""He said, 'Mom, if I don't go, they don't have nobody,'"" Gladys Zimmerman said. She said her son also participated in a 2010 campaign to ""get justice"" for an African-American homeless man who was seen in a videotape taken by an onlooker being struck by a man who later turned out to be the son of a Sanford police lieutenant. ""He went to churches. He put fliers on cars"" and organized a meeting seeking help for the man, his mother testified. He was recognized by the city for his efforts, his mother said. CNN has not been able to confirm Zimmerman's participation in the campaign. Zimmerman was studying criminal justice and wanted someday to be a judge or a magistrate, said his father, Robert Zimmerman Sr. -- who had also been a magistrate. ""He's always been concerned about people in society, so he wanted to be able to help somehow,"" the elder Zimmerman said. Prosecutors sought to paint a darker picture of Zimmerman as a man with a violent past who could not be trusted to go free pending his trial. Assistant State Attorney Bernie de la Rionda cited two incidents -- a 2005 case in which a police officer accused Zimmerman of battery and another incident in which a woman filed a domestic violence injunction against Zimmerman after a scuffle. Zimmerman apologizes as judge sets $150,000 bond . In the 2005 case, Zimmerman was charged with battery on a law enforcement officer and obstruction of justice after tussling with an alcoholic beverage control officer. The charges were later reduced to a misdemeanor after Zimmerman agreed to enter a diversion program and take an anger management class, according to testimony in Friday's hearing. According to a police report of the incident, which de la Rionda read in court, Zimmerman refused a law enforcement officer's orders to back off, saying, ""I don't care who you are"" after the officer identified himself. After a brief scuffle, the officer arrested Zimmerman. But Zimmerman's family said Zimmerman told them that the officer never identified himself, and he was only trying to come to the aid of a friend who he had seen being shoved against the wall by a man in plainclothes. ""He felt his friend was in danger and he was just trying to protect his friend,"" said Zimmerman's wife, Shellie Nicole Zimmerman. In the other case, de la Rionda said a woman filed papers in which she said Zimmerman smacked her in the mouth and ""asked her how it felt,"" as well as grabbed her and threw her on a bed. Timeline of events in Trayvon Martin case . Shellie Zimmerman said her understanding was that Zimmerman was only acting to protect himself after the woman scratched him and drew blood. ""Absolutely he is not a violent person nor a threat to the community,"" she said. Zimmerman also took the stand, an unusual move in a bond hearing and a risky decision for any defendant in any criminal case, much less a one involving a murder charge, said his attorney Mark O'Mara. It was his first public statement since the shooting. ""I wanted to say I am sorry for the loss of your son,"" Zimmerman told Martin's parents Friday in what his attorney said was a risky and heartfelt apology from the witness stand. ""I did not know how old he was. I thought he was a little bit younger than I was, and I did not know if he was armed or not.""","More details emerge about George Zimmerman at bond hearing .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea is planning a nuclear test in the area where it has staged previous atomic blasts, according to a report from South Korean intelligence officials obtained by CNN. The intelligence report has come to light as North Korea gets ready to carry out a rocket launch this week, a move that would further strain ties between the reclusive, nuclear-armed state and other countries. The launch is scheduled to take place just months after the ascendancy of its new leader. The South Korean intelligence report says it is probable that after the long-range rocket launch, North Korea will use the ensuing international condemnation as an excuse to go ahead with the nuclear test in Punggye-ri, the site in the country's northeast where the other two tests were conducted in 2006 and 2009. The report, which said such a test would be considered a grave provocation, includes satellite images that it says were shot recently and show the final stages of a tunnel being dug at the site. The photos show an unusual pile of earth and sand near the opening of the tunnel, and the report says this pile has been growing in size since March. North Korean state media outlets have not made an announcement regarding any plans for a new nuclear test. On Monday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said the rocket launch would further isolate the country. ""We view the potential rocket launch as a very provocative act that would be, if it were conducted, done in direct violation of North Korea's international obligations,"" he told reporters. ""Any further underground testing would be a provocative action ... in each case, this would be an indication of North Korea's decision, at the leadership level, not to take the steps that are necessary to allow North Korea to end its isolation, to rejoin the community of nations and to do something about the extreme poverty and deprivation that its people suffer from because of the nature of the system they live under and the isolation that they have brought on themselves."" He added, ""I don't have any specific communications involving the president to report out to you today, but we are very focused on this."" Such an act by Pyongyang ""would make it virtually impossible for the United States to provide the nutritional assistance that we had planned to provide."" A university official sees North Korea's latest moves as calculating. ""Once again this shows ... they know how to manipulate the world,"" said Andrei Lankov of Seoul's Kookmin University. ""If they do a missile launch and in a few months a successful nuclear test, especially a uranium-based nuclear device, it will send a very strong message to the world. The same message they always want to deliver: We are here, we are dangerous, unpredictable and it's better to deal with us by giving us monetary and food concessions."" In private meetings brokered in part by China, North Korea in February agreed to stop nuclear tests, uranium enrichment and long-range missile launches in exchange for resumption of U.S. food aid. A launch and a test, if carried out, could also derail recent efforts to reconvene the multilateral talks, known as six-party talks, on denuclearizing North Korea. ""We believe, in particular, that China joins us in its interest in seeing a denuclearized Korean peninsula, and we are continuing to encourage China, in particular, to act more effectively in that interest,"" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters in Washington. Pyongyang agreed to curtail its nuclear activities in exchange for aid in an agreement reached in talks in September 2005. The deal fell apart after North Korea conducted nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009 and later disclosed a previously unknown uranium enrichment program that provided a second path to a bomb, in addition to the already known plutonium program. The country has designated 2012 as a year of strength and prosperity to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the founder of the communist state. His birthday next Sunday, known as the ""Day of the Sun,"" is a key public holiday on the North Korean calendar. Last month, Pyongyang announced it would launch a rocket carrying a satellite sometime between this Thursday and the following Monday to mark the occasion. The North Korean government says the operation is for peaceful purposes. But Japan, the United States and South Korea see the launch as a cover for a long-range ballistic missile test. The South Korean intelligence report noted that shortly before the last two nuclear tests, North Korea launched what it said were satellites into orbit. The act of firing the long-range rocket would breach U.N. Security Council resolutions. Japan has said it will shoot down any part of the rocket that enters its territory. The planned launch is scheduled to take place less than four months after Kim Jong Un became ""supreme leader"" of North Korea, succeeding his father, Kim Jong Il, who died in December. Analysts are trying to gauge how much influence the younger Kim, thought to be in his late 20s, wields. Senior officials in the regime, including Kim's uncle, Jang Song Taek, are considered to exert considerable sway on policy. North Korea granted a rare glimpse Sunday of its preparations for the rocket launch, taking a group of journalists to the Sohae Satellite Launching Station in Tongchang-ri, in the northwest part of the country. ""If you look for yourselves with your own eyes, then you can judge whether it's a ballistic missile, or whether it's a launch vehicle to put a satellite into orbit,"" Jang Myong Jin, head of the launch site, said through a translator. ""That's why we've invited you to this launch site."" Journalists -- who were not allowed to take laptops or cell phones to the site, but were permitted to shoot video -- were shown the control center and the satellite that officials said would be shot into space. The rocket itself is 30 meters, or about 100 feet, long. It was white, with red and blue paint. International leaders have urged North Korea to cancel the launch, but Pyongyang has refused to back down, insisting that it needs the satellite to gather information on its crops, forests and weather. An independent European analyst who visited the launch site said he saw nothing obvious that raised red flags. ""I don't know what they want to do in the future, but today what we see is a space launcher,"" Christian Lardier said. Bill Richardson, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Kim Jong Un may be trying to consolidate his leadership by sending a message to two audiences -- to the international community, he may be trying to establish himself as in charge. But his most important audience is the North Korean military and party leaders, he told CNN. ""He's trying to show them that he is not going to buckle down from the United States or the six-party talks or China; that they're going to proceed with this launch; that they're going to proceed with him taking over the leadership of the country."" Richardson urged the United States not to react in haste. ""Let's see what eventually happens,"" he said. ""This is how the North Koreans operate: They try to send these huge, scary messages by these actions."" The last time Pyongyang carried out what it described as a satellite launch, in April 2009, the U.N. Security Council condemned the action and demanded that it not be repeated. China, North Korea's closest ally and largest provider of aid, has expressed concern about the planned launch. Beijing says it has held talks with Pyongyang on the matter, but they appear to have had little effect on the North's plans. ""China strongly encourages everyone involved to remain calm and reasonable,"" said the Chinese foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, according to a report issued Monday by the official Chinese news agency, Xinhua. ""These issues need to be worked out in a diplomatic and peaceful manner."" Analysts say the planned trajectory of the multistaged rocket's path is north to south over the Yellow Sea, with the main body of the projectile eventually landing in the Pacific Ocean near the Philippines. President Benigno Aquino III of the Philippines has condemned any such launch as a ""needless provocation"" that could increase tensions in Southeast Asia. CNN's Stan Grant and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","Ex-U.S. ambassador to United Nations: Don't react hastily; ""let's see what eventually happens""

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Philadelphia's Catholic archbishop announced Friday that five priests will not be reinstated following a church investigation into accusations of child sex abuse, though the men have a right to an appeal. The church also determined that three suspended clergymen are now considered ""suitable for ministry,"" while the findings of its investigation into 17 others would not be announced until a later date, Archbishop Charles Chaput told reporters. Dozens of priests were placed on administrative leave after the release of a 2011 grand jury report that blamed the Archdiocese of Philadelphia for failing to prevent the sexual abuse of children. ""I've been in Philadelphia for less than a year, and I've tried as quickly as possible to understand all of the many issues facing our local church,"" Chaput said Friday. ""During that time, dealing with sexual abuse and protecting children has been, and will remain, a top priority for me and for this archdiocese."" He said that of those remaining 17 church investigations, six have not yet been cleared by law enforcement, which prevents a church probe from being initiated. Two others have only recently been cleared, while the findings of the remaining nine clergy members will soon be announced. Attorney Dan Monahan, who is representing one of the alleged victims, told CNN that the archdiocese said a clergyman accused of sexually abusing his client will not be reinstated. The accused clergyman -- whom CNN is not currently naming -- was among those suspended after the grand jury report. That report led to the Philadelphia district attorney's office charging four priests and a parochial school teacher with raping and assaulting boys in their care. Monsignor William Lynn, once a longtime supervisor of Philadelphia priests, is suspected of allowing the abusive priests to have access to children. From 1992 until 2004, Lynn was responsible for investigating reports that priests had sexually abused children. He has pleaded not guilty, and he has said through his attorneys that he reported those allegations of sex abuse. The landmark case is unusual because the charges go beyond accusations against priests and include a church higher-up charged with covering up the abuse -- a move analysts say is unprecedented in the United States. With nearly 1.5 million members, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia is one of the largest in the nation. Priests, particularly those in high-ranking positions, have an exceptional amount of power within the Catholic Church, especially in Philadelphia because of the church's deep roots in the community.","NEW: The five men have a right to an appeal, Philadelphia's Catholic archbishop says .

"(CNN) -- The leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council will hold a meeting Monday in Saudi Arabia to discuss transforming their six nations into a union, similar to the European Union. The idea of the GCC nations to integrate into one entity -- and replace what exists now as simply a cooperative -- was first floated by Saudi Arabia in December. Monday's meeting in Riyadh will lay out the timetable for it. The GCC is comprised of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. ""The threats of all kinds require the hard works of the GCC countries to shift from a current formula of cooperation to a union formula acceptable to the six countries,"" Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal said last month. He didn't specify what threats he was referring to. But some analysts have said the GCC move could be an effort to counter the growing influence of Shiite Iran. The GCC was formed in 1981, soon after Iran instituted a Shiite theocracy and went to war with primarily Sunni Iraq. Iran and Iraq have enjoyed closer ties in recent years, especially as Iraq's Shia Muslim majority has solidified its power in the absence of former leader Saddam Hussein, a Sunni Muslim. After U.S. forces pulled out of Iraq last year, Tehran has expanded military and security cooperation with Baghdad. Also, GCC member Bahrain blames Iran for fueling the anti-government unrest that continues to roil the country. Tehran has denied involvement. Bahrain is a predominantly Shiite country, ruled by a Sunni royal family. Last year, at the height of the protests, Bahrain called it troops from member nations Saudi Arabia and the UAE and cracked down. Iran is also engaged in a longtime border dispute with the UAE over three Persian Gulf islands; Abu Mousa, and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs. The UAE says Iran has illegally occupied the islands. Iran views them as part of its territory. In this climate, comes the GCC move to form a union. ""Such strategic vision would include common approaches to defense, security, political and economic long-term interests,"" said GCC Assistant Secretary General Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg in an opinion piece Sunday in the Saudi English-language daily, Arab News. Already, Al Wefaq, Bahrain's main Shiite opposition party, has demanded that the Bahraini government put the idea to a popular vote before it agrees. ""The people of the states of the European Union voted on the union decision before the union was announced. The people of the Gulf should also have their say,"" he said.","""Threats of all kinds"" require such a union, the Saudi foreign minister says .

"Beijing (CNN) -- A prominent Chinese human rights activist has called for an investigation into what he describes as corrupt and cruel officials who he says ""violently assaulted"" him and his family before he escaped from house arrest and fled to Beijing. Chen Guangcheng addressed the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, in a video posted on YouTube on Friday, detailing the abuses he said he and his family had suffered at the hands of authorities during more than 18 months of heavily guarded detention in their home. ""They broke into my house and more than a dozen men assaulted my wife,"" he said. ""They pinned her down and wrapped her in a comforter, beating and kicking her for hours. They also similarly violently assaulted me."" Chinese authorities have not commented. The activist, who is blind, was driven to Beijing on Sunday after evading his guards in the tiny village of Dongshigu in Shandong Province, He Peirong, a friend and fellow activist, said Friday. Escape was like a Hollywood thriller . His high-profile breakout appears to have angered the local authorities who were holding him captive, with members of his family already reporting that they have suffered reprisals. Chen, 40, is a self-taught lawyer who rose to fame in the late 1990s thanks to his legal advocacy for what he called victims of abusive practices, such as alleged forced abortions, by China's family-planning officials. A local court sentenced Chen to four years and three months in prison for damaging property, disrupting traffic and ""pressurizing the government"" in a protest, according to a story from the state-run Xinhua news agency. The same 2007 story, which reported that a higher court had denied his appeal, described Chen as a ""blind mob organizer."" His supporters have maintained authorities used trumped-up charges to silence him. Since his September 2010 release from prison, he had been confined to his home along with his wife, mother and daughter. In the video posted Friday, he said the treatment of him and his family by the local security forces ""was so cruel it has greatly harmed the image of the Communist Party."" Calling on Wen to investigate his case, he asked: ""Is it just local officials flagrantly violating the law or do they have the support of the central government? I hope you will give the public a clear answer in the near future."" The blind activist had prepared for his escape for months, He Peirong said, by lying in bed for prolonged periods so that the guards wouldn't be suspicious if they didn't see any activity from him for a long time. Once free, Chen contacted He Peirong and a few other activists. ""We learned that he had escaped and needed our help,"" she said, in an interview via Skype from her home city of Nanjing. They met him at a rendezvous point, and then drove him to Beijing and hid him in a safe house, He Peirong said. She said that Chen's fellow activists had decided to publicize his flight from captivity after hearing that Shandong authorities, upon discovering his disappearance, had sent people to assault members of his family. Chen Kegui, the blind activist's nephew, said in a phone conversation with a Chinese activist that local officials broke into his family's home. He said he used kitchen knives to defend himself when the officials tried to arrest him. ""I was afraid they might knock me down unconscious or beat me to death, so I went out to find somewhere safe,"" the nephew said in the conversation, a recording of which was posted online. He added that he had since called the police and was waiting for them to come and pick him up. Repeated attempts to reach Chen Kegui by phone were unsuccessful. The blind activist expressed concern in the video about the welfare of his wife, mother and daughter -- who did not escape with him and whose whereabouts were unknown Friday. ""Although I'm free, my worries are only deepening,"" he said. ""My wife, mother and children are still in their evil hands. They have been persecuting my family for a long time, and my escape would only prompt them into a mode of revenge."" U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay echoed those sentiments, saying in a statement released Friday that she is ""disturbed to hear reports that other family members ... have now been detailed."" Noting she has raised concerns about Chen's case before, Pillay urged Chinese authorities ""to investigate the treatment of both him and his family, to ensure their physical integrity and to provide redress for any wrongdoing by local officials."" Repeated calls seeking comment from the local authorities in Shandong went unanswered. Chen is relatively weak physically but his spirits are high, said He Peirong. There have been concerns about Chen's health during his time under house arrest, surrounded by a heavy police presence. ""He wants to live freely in his own country,"" He Peirong said. ""He said he hopes to hold my hand and take me to his village one day."" The authorities' reaction to Chen's escape appeared to have ensnared He Peirong, too, after she spoke to CNN and other news media organizations Friday to publicize the situation. Bob Fu, the head of the U.S.-based nonprofit group ChinaAid, said that he was communicating with He Peirong via Skype when she said that state security agents had arrived at her home. Attempts to contact her since then have been unsuccessful. She had acknowledged that, by speaking out about Chen's escape, she was putting herself at risk. ""I'm not concerned about my own safety,"" she said during the Skype interview. ""I hope they'll arrest me, not my friends."" Chen himself has been a focal point for some time, with journalists and sympathizers being prevented from visiting him. They include actor Christian Bale, who was roughed up by security guards during such an attempt in December. Last year, in a video smuggled out of the country by a U.S.-based human rights group, Chen described his dire conditions of being a prisoner in his own home. ""Those people stand at the four corners of my house, spy on my family and monitor what we do,"" he said. ""They installed floodlights and surveillance cameras around my house."" Chen's incarceration and allegations of abuse by local officials have drawn international criticism from the likes of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Gary Locke, the U.S. ambassador to China. Women's Rights Without Frontiers, a U.S.-based nongovernmental organization that has been advocating Chen's release, urged Clinton to raise the case when she visits Beijing next month. ""We are grateful that Chen is no longer under house arrest, but we are concerned about his safety and that of his family,"" Reggie Littlejohn, the organization's president, said in a statement. CNN's Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","NEW: U.N. human rights chief is ""disturbed"" Chen Guangcheng's kin may be detained .

"(CNN) -- A Colorado judge Monday handed down sentences ranging from 18 to 32 years in prison to a trio of siblings arrested after a multistate crime spree in 2011. Lee Grace and Ryan Dougherty and half-brother Dylan Stanley-Dougherty were captured after a shootout with police in August and had pleaded guilty to related charges. Huerfano County District Judge Claude W. Appel gave Stanley-Dougherty a 32-year prison term, while Lee Grace Dougherty was sentenced to 24 years and Ryan Dougherty to 18. Stanley-Dougherty, 27, offered an emotional apology in court before his sentence, the maximum allowed under his plea agreement. ""I never intended to, I never tried to, I never wanted to hurt anybody,"" he said, struggling to speak through tears. ""It is true that I acted out of desperation, and I am sorry for the choices that I made. I wish I had done things differently. I truly am sorry to anybody that was involved."" Following nine days as fugitives, the trio crashed in rural Huerfano County while trying to evade police at speeds of up to 120 mph, authorities said. Stanley-Dougherty fired an AK-47 rifle at pursuing officers during the chase, while his sister was shot in the right leg after pulling a gun on Walsenburg Police Chief James Chamberlain. ""I deserved to get shot,"" she later told the FBI. ""I pointed the gun at the cop."" District Attorney Frank Ruybalid said she was educated enough to know better, and asked Appel to consider their entire cross-country flight from the law. ""I would characterize this as a case of missed opportunities,"" he said. Ruybalid said Stanley-Dougherty was thrown from the car along with his weapon when the crash occurred. The trio still faces charges related to allegations that they shot at a police officer in Florida and robbed a south Georgia bank before heading west. Ruybalid said surveillance video from the bank in Valdosta showed Lee Grace Dougherty firing a MAC-10 machine pistol, and shell casings from the bank matched a weapon found with the group after their capture. ""I believe the evidence is very strong, that this family didn't have any money to continue the crime spree if she hadn't participated in the bank robbery,"" Ruybalid said.","NEW: Dylan Stanley-Dougherty gets 32 years in prison, sister gets 24 years, brother gets 18 .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The Israeli military said Monday that it has suspended an officer who was caught on video striking a pro-Palestinian activist in the face. In a statement, the military described the incident as severe and promised that the circumstances would be investigated and ""the necessary measures carried out."" Video of the incident, which took place Saturday near the West Bank city of Jericho, shows a group of Israeli soldiers attempting to prevent a group of dozens of bicycle-riding activists from passing. One of the activists is next to an Israeli soldier, who suddenly hits the young man in the face with an M-16 rifle. The man falls to the ground and is quickly dragged away by his peers. The video was posted to You Tube on Sunday by a pro-Palestinian advocacy group. He was treated in a Palestinian hospital for light injuries. For reasons of security, when contacted by phone the injured activist would provide only his first name, which he said was Andaers. He said he was participating in a bicycle tour through the Jordan River Valley organized to bring attention to the Israeli military occupation of the West Bank. When his group encountered a military roadblock, Andaers said, he and a few other bikers decided to move peacefully toward the soldiers. ""We walked slowly towards them; the immediate response as you see from the video was violence."" Andaers said. ""One senior officer took off his rifle and beat three people, including myself."" Andaers said that ""there was no justification for the violence"" and that he was considering legal action. The video prompted a quick and emphatic response from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said in a statement Sunday, ""This behaviour does not characterize the soldiers and commanders of the (Israeli Defense Forces) and has no place in the IDF and the State of Israel."" The officer has been identified as Lt. Col. Shalom Eisner, who served as commander for soldiers in the West Bank. Israeli military spokeswoman Lt. Col. Avital Leibovich said the officer's actions were not in line with military training and did ""not bide with the ethical code and the moral values that we teach our soldiers and commanders"" but suggested that the video did not tell the whole story. ""It was an illegal riot trying to block a road,"" Leibovich said of the activists. The video, she maintained, represented an edited 30 seconds of a 120-minute-long event in which the officer in question had his hand broken by stick-wielding protesters. ""I'm not sure the violence of the event was conveyed in those 30 seconds,"" she said. Bader Zama'reh, the director of Sharek Youth Forum, which organized the bicycle event, rejected the Israeli military's characterization. ""This was not a protest; this was a peaceful march,"" Zama'reh said. ""They have overreacted to everything they did. This was a peaceful activity. The youth had bicycles and wanted to ride.""","Tape of Saturday's incident shows soldiers attempting to block activists .

"(CNN) -- In dueling speeches that sought to frame the economic debate for their election showdown in November, President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney on Thursday offered differing visions for how to restore strong growth while telling separate Ohio crowds that the other's policies have failed. The president and the former Massachusetts governor both emphasized particular themes of community in their campaign speeches in a battleground state hit hard by the 2008 recession and its aftermath. Romney, speaking at a factory in the Cincinnati area minutes before Obama's speech in Cleveland, focused on what he called the president's failure to deliver promised economic growth so far in his first term. ""Talk is cheap,"" Romney, the certain Republican nominee, said of the incumbent Democratic president. ""Action speaks very loud, and if you want to see the results of his economic policies, look around Ohio and the country."" He encouraged voters to ask their friends and neighbors if they are better off since Obama became president, predicting that small business owners, bankers, unemployed college graduates and others will answer no. Obama, meanwhile, emphasized the election is about a choice for the direction of the country, saying Romney ""and his allies in Congress"" advocate the same economic policies of tax cuts and deregulation that brought the recent recession. He cited in particular the refusal by congressional Republicans to accept any kind of tax increase on the wealthy, saying that stance prevented a comprehensive deficit reduction agreement last year. ""The only thing that can break the stalemate is you,"" Obama said to cheers. ""This November is your chance to render a verdict on the debate over how to grow the economy, how to create good jobs, how to pay down our deficit."" The nearly simultaneous addresses reflected what polls have consistently shown -- the economy is the top issue in the November presidential election -- and both campaigns continued their high-stakes efforts to seize the advantage on it. Obama has been rocked by bad economic news in recent weeks, including a tepid May jobs report and Thursday's news that first-time unemployment claims rose slightly last week. Last Friday, the president provided fuel to Romney's repeated claims that he is out of touch and his policies have been ineffective by telling reporters that compared to the public sector, the private sector ""is doing fine."" Obama clarifies: Economy 'not doing fine' A new Romney campaign ad Thursday replays the president uttering the phrase several times while highlighting the nation's economic woes by flashing on-screen text: ""23.2 million Americans are unemployed,"" ""40 straight months over 8% unemployment"" and ""middle-class struggles deepen under Obama."" The spot is the first negative ad against Obama by the Romney camp so far in the general election campaign, although super-PACs backing Romney have run attack ads against the president. Obama tried to play down the rough patch, telling the raucous Cuyahoga Community College crowd that the campaign will be long and tough. ""Over the next five months, this election will take many twists and many turns, polls will go up and polls will go down, there will be no shortage of gaffes and controversies that keep both campaigns busy and give the press something to write about,"" he said, adding with a smile that ""you may have heard I recently made my own unique contribution to that process."" As the audience laughed, Obama added: ""It wasn't the first time. It won't be the last."" He summed up the Republican campaign as an attack against his presidency, saying the ""scary voice"" in television and Romney himself will ""tell you the economy is bad, that it is all my fault, that I can't fix it because I think government is always the answer or because I didn't make a lot of money in the private sector and don't understand it, or because I am in over my head, or because I think everybody is doing just fine."" ""That may be their plan to win the election but it is not a plan to create jobs,"" Obama said. ""It is not a plan to grow the economy."" He cited the ravages of the recession on the economy and highlighted progress made by his administration, being careful to note that people are still hurting and more needs to happen. At the same time, Obama offered his oft-repeated call for a balanced approach to economic growth and deficit reduction that raises taxes on the wealthy and holds down spending while ensuring that critical areas for future growth such as education, clean energy and infrastructure development get needed money. In his speech, Romney also stuck with his stump themes, saying Obama blew his chance to fix the economy and now it is time for change. ""My experience in thinking about people who I want to have work for me, whether it's my doctor or the person that's going to be painting the house, I want to make sure they did a good job the first time and if they didn't, I want someone who can do a better job,"" Romney said. A survey released Thursday showed that more Americans blame former President George W. Bush than Obama for the continuing economic problems that began in the previous administration. According to the Gallup poll, 68% of respondents said Bush deserves either a great deal or a moderate amount of blame, compared with 31% who said the former president deserves not much or no blame at all. In the survey, 52% said Obama deserves blame, with 48% saying he isn't to blame for current economic conditions. Another poll shows independent voters are dissatisfied with the economic plans of both candidates. According to the Washington Post/ABC News survey released Wednesday, 54% of independents have an unfavorable view of Obama's plan for the economy, and 47% view Romney's economic plan unfavorably. It says 38% view Obama's plan favorably, compared with 35% who feel the same about Romney's plan. The survey showing negative marks for each candidate's economic plan reflected strong racial divides among Americans. White voters were split on Romney's plan, with 42% viewing it favorably and 42% viewing it unfavorably. Minority voters were far less positive, with 68% of black voters and 48% of Latino voters viewing the Republican candidate's plan unfavorably. Both groups gave much higher marks to Obama -- 81% of black voters and 59% of Latino voters had a favorable view of the Democrat incumbent's plan. Romney's policies reflect the GOP goal of shrinking government and cutting taxes to reduce the mounting federal deficit and national debt. Led by conservatives, Republicans argue such steps will boost economic growth to bring in more revenue -- despite the tax cuts -- and shrink the deficit. Obama calls for ending Bush-era tax cuts for families making more than $250,000 a year as well as tax breaks for the oil industry and others to increase revenue, while also holding down spending and seeking long-term entitlement reforms. Both parties and presidential campaigns have been guilty of making dubious claims about the other as the campaign rhetoric has heated up. Bill Adair, the editor of the Pulitzer Prize winning web site Politifact.org, said his recent fact-checks of the candidates have rated nearly all of their claims to be half-truths. ""The campaigns are cherry-picking statistics that don't tell a full story,"" Adair said. Kathleen Hall Jamieson with the Annenberg Center for Public Policy said ad distortions from both candidates in both parties are typical of a campaign that has ""specialized in taking words out of context."" Jamieson's office launched its own fact-checking site, Flackcheck.org, to police campaign ads for their distortions. The web site features a montage of television spots that are guilty of using a wide array of deceptive techniques. ""The danger is people hear the sound bite repeated in ads, see it repeated in the news, and lose track of the original context,"" Jamieson said. ""It becomes the reality and in the process, there's a serious deception.""

"(CNN) -- After receiving nearly 100 reports of stuck gas pedals in Ford and Mazda vehicles, federal regulators said Tuesday they have launched an investigation into the problem, which is a suspected cause of one death and nine injuries. The stuck accelerators are being investigated for their possible role in one fatal accident, 13 nonfatal crashes or fires and eight injury accidents, according to the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration. Ford and Mazda said 591,245 vehicles were potentially affected, according to the automakers' reports to the NHTSA in 2004. More than half the vehicles were 2001-2004 model year Ford Escapes. The remaining vehicles were 2001-2004 Mazda Tributes. The NHTSA now has identified 730,000 vehicles potentially affected, expanding the scope of vehicles in question. All 730,000 are 2001-2004 Ford Escape and Mazda Tribute SUVs with V6 engines, according to the NHTSA. Mazda and Ford issued recalls in 2004 on models of the sport utility vehicles that had 3.0 liter six cylinder engines. Several of the reports to the NHTSA involve vehicles not covered by previous recalls, the agency said in a letter to Ford's Environmental and Safety Compliance Global Director on Thursday. One complaint is based on a fatal crash that occurred in January 2012, the NHTSA said. Some of the complaints allege that failures may have been related to repairs made in response to safety recalls initiated in 2004, the investigation summary said. The 2004 Ford and Mazda recalls were for the vehicle speed control cables in their affected vehicles. Letters were also sent to dealers and customers, according to filings on the NHTSA website. ""On your vehicle, it is possible that the accelerator cable may prevent the throttle from returning to the idle position, possibly resulting in elevated engine speeds while driving,"" Ford's letter to customers read. ""An unexpected increase in engine idle speed may increase stopping distance and may result in a vehicle crash without warning."" The Center for Auto Safety petitioned the NHTSA to open a similar investigation on July 8. The petition was denied Thursday because part of the request is being covered by the agency's newly opened investigation. The NHTSA has opened the investigation to assess ""the scope, frequency and safety-related consequences of the alleged defect,"" the agency said. Neither Ford nor Mazda responded to CNN's requests for comment.","NHTSA has received nearly 100 reports of stuck gas pedals .

"(CNN) -- About 10 aid workers, some of them from the United Nations, are being held by authorities in an area of western Myanmar where sectarian clashes killed scores of people last month, the U.N. office in the country said Friday. The authorities in the state of Rakhine have detained the workers for ""questioning,"" the U.N. Information Center Yangon said in a situation report published on its website. Yangon is the largest city and former capital of Myanmar. The United Nations said it was waiting for a formal reply from the government after requesting information on the situation. Out of concern for the workers' privacy, the organization said it wasn't releasing any personal or professional information about them. The aid group Doctors Without Borders said Friday one of its staff members had been released but that five were still among those in detention. ""We are in touch with the authorities to try to confirm their well-being,"" the group's Wai Sze Leung said in an e-mailed statement. The organization has temporarily suspended its activities and reduced staff in Rakhine, where it has worked since 1992, Leung said. Myanmar frees more political prisoners . This incident comes at a time that Myanmar has released hundreds of political prisoners, including opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, and instituted a series of political reforms after decades of repressive military rule. Western governments have responded to the efforts by easing sanctions on the country. Violence between Buddhists and Muslims in Rakhine has flared up after the police detained three Muslim men in relation to the rape and killing of a Buddhist woman in late May. News of the crime appears to have motivated several hundred people to attack a bus in Rakhine in June, killing 10 Muslims. Clashes then spread across the northern part of the state, resulting in the destruction of thousands of homes and the deaths of at least 62 people, the government has said. The national government declared a state of emergency in Rakhine, bringing in the military to help restore order. Reports of further attacks in Rakhine have ""substantially decreased"" in the past couple of the weeks, the U.N. report said Friday. But tensions between the two communities remain high, it said, noting government estimates that 55,000 people have been displaced at this point. The strained relationship between Buddhists and Muslims is making humanitarian efforts more difficult, the United Nations added. Rakhine is home to the Rohingya, an ethnic Muslim minority who say they have been persecuted by the Myanmar military during its decades of authoritarian rule. Hundreds of Rohingyas have tried to cross the border into neighboring Bangladesh to flee the sectarian violence. Will vice president's exit boost Myanmar's reform efforts?

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- California is poised to become home to the nation's first truly high-speed rail system with Gov. Jerry Brown's signing Wednesday of a law authorizing the first leg of construction for a line that will eventually connect Los Angeles and San Francisco. California will issue $2.6 billion in bonds, with the federal government providing an additional $3.2 billion, to build the initial segment of the high-speed rail between Merced and the San Fernando Valley on the north side of Los Angeles, officials said. The high-speed rail project was part of a transportation bill signed by Brown that calls for general improvements to the state's rail system involving a total of $4.7 billion in state funding matched with $7.9 billion in federal and local funds, officials said. ""This legislation will help put thousands of people in California back to work,"" Brown said at Union Station in downtown Los Angeles, according to a news release. ""By improving regional transportation systems, we are investing in the future of our state and making California a better place to live and work."" Rail industry aims to hire 5,000 veterans in 2012 . The California High-Speed Rail Authority says the rail line initially will allow passengers to zip between San Francisco and Los Angeles via the Central Valley in two hours and 40 minutes. The line is envisioned to carry travelers between Los Angeles and San Diego in 80 minutes and, in the northern part of the state, will eventually connect to Sacramento, the authority said. In all, the 800 miles of track will include up to 24 stations, the authority said. Andy Kunz, president and CEO of the U.S. High Speed Rail Association, said the California high-speed train will travel at 220 mph. ""California will be home to the nation's first true high-speed rail,"" Kunz told CNN. ""True high-speed rails around the world are running between 186 miles an hour to 220 miles an hour. That's pretty much the standard in the world."" The closest speed to the California project is Amtrak's Acela Express in the Northeast, which averages 80 mph between New York City and Washington, D.C., but reaches 150 mph for a few miles near Boston, Kunz said. That line is not built on a dedicated high-speed track as California's line will be, he said. ""California leads the way for many new things in this country, whether it's organic food or high technology or filmmaking. This will be the chance for California to lead the nation in transportation as well,"" he said. High-speed rail isn't vulnerable to the rising global fuel prices that afflict the airline industry, and it will relieve highway gridlock, he said. California Senate approves funding for high-speed rail . ""High speed is the only thing coming over the horizon that can actually give us a better future,"" said Kunz, whose nonprofit trade association seeks a 17,000-mile national high-speed rail system by 2030. Joseph Shelhorse, the association's vice president of business development, said his group is working with developers on private-public partnerships to build high-speed track beds in exchange for real estate development rights above and around high-speed train stations -- much as the U.S. government under President Abraham Lincoln did for the first transcontinental railroad. The California project, however, has had its share of critics, including John Tos, an almond farmer. ""We want them to stay off the land. It is not our intention to allow this to happen through our property. We farmed here for a reason, the tranquility of it all. This is farming country. And we want to keep it like that,"" he said earlier this year. Other critics are concerned about the potential for cost overruns, and question the project's timing given the economic slump. Joe Simitian, a Democratic state senator, was among those who voted against the bill. ""The question we have to ask ourselves today is -- even if you support the vision -- is this a plan that is worthy of our support?"" he said during debate. President Barack Obama is a big supporter of high-speed rail. His administration has proposed spending $53 billion on a national high-speed rail network, while he has set the goal of giving 80% of Americans access to high-speed rail within 25 years.

"(CNN) -- On only his second day in office on Monday, Hong Kong's chief executive was chased out of a town hall meeting by protesters, in a continuation of the widespread backlash against his appointment, according to local media reports. As the forum at a community center was drawing to a close, dozens of young protesters began to shout and hold up placards accusing Leung Chun-ying of putting on a ""political show."" Police escorted Leung out of the building and formed a human chain to clear a path to his car, which was swamped by protesters. The meeting, held in Tuen Mun district, was the first of six district visits planned for Leung to meet residents and discuss issues of concern in a public forum. It followed Leung's promise to improve communication with the public. Following his inauguration on Sunday, 400,000 protesters flooded the streets for the city's annual July 1 protest, in heightened numbers not seen since the turnout of 500,000 at the 2003 march, according to protest organizers. Police estimates of crowd numbers were much lower at 63,000. Read about Hong Kong's mass protest on July 1 . Leung's appointment, which was sealed by an elite 1,200-member committee with the Chinese central government's blessing in March, topped citizens' list of ongoing grievances. Sunday's protest was dominated by chants for Leung to step down, dotted with banners and costumes mocking his credibility. Leung has come under fire most recently for six illegal building structures discovered at his home, which he claimed were installed by a previous tenant. He has also been accused of taking a hard-line approach on public freedoms and being a secret member of the Chinese Communist Party, allegations which he has denied. The backlash against Leung is a microcosm of the city's frustration over a lack of universal suffrage, amid fears of Beijing's encroachment into the city's affairs and freedoms.","Hong Kong's new chief executive chased out of town hall meeting by protesters .

"Guantanamo Bay, Cuba (CNN) -- Through hours of outbursts and objections in military court, Eddie Bracken said he had one image in his mind: that of a plane smashing into the World Trade Center tower where his sister worked. Anger surged inside him, Bracken told reporters Sunday, a day after he sat among a group of victim family members who watched the arraignment of accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four others at Guantanamo Bay, the U.S. naval base where the men are being tried before a military court. ""Just listening to that rhetoric, how they perceive themselves -- it's hurtful, because they have no remorse. I don't think they even have any souls,"" he said. Bracken's sister, Lucy Fishman, worked as a secretary on the 105th floor of the south tower of the World Trade Center. She was one of the nearly 3,000 people killed when the towers were brought down by hijacked jetliners on September 11, 2001. Outside the courtroom Sunday, Bracken read a statement he said was a message for Mohammed and the other men. ""I came a long way to see you, eye to eye. ... If you would have this in another country, it would be a different story. They would have given you your wish to meet your maker quicker than you would realize. But this is America, and you deserve a fair and just trial, according to our Constitution, not yours. That's what separates us Americans from you and your ideology,"" he said. But still, he told reporters, hearing the defendants and their attorneys criticize the proceedings was difficult. ""They're complaining, and our families can't complain no more. They took their lives. ... I wouldn't care if they were on a bed of nails. ... But it's our justice system, and they have rights,"" he said. Earlier Sunday, an attorney representing one of the defendants said prolonged silence and occasional outbursts during their arraignment were signs of ""peaceful resistance to an unjust system."" ""These men have endured years of inhumane treatment and torture,"" James Connell, who is representing defendant Ali Abdul Aziz Ali, told reporters at Guantanamo Bay. U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Mark Martins, the chief prosecutor in the case, declined to discuss the defendants' behaviors but said the military trial process is just and impartial. ""You all saw them. You saw their reactions. I saw a process that was moving forward methodically,"" he told reporters Sunday. The attorneys' comments came after a 13-hour court session on Saturday -- the first appearance in a military courtroom for Mohammed and four others since charges were re-filed against them in connection with the attacks. The hearing, which wrapped just before 10:30 p.m., offered a rare glimpse of the five men who have not been seen publicly since January 2009, when they were first charged by a military tribunal. Mohammed, Ali and the others -- Walid Muhammad Salih, Mubarak bin 'Attash, Ramzi Bin al-Shibh and Mustafa Ahmed Adam al Hawsawi -- appeared to work together to defy the judge's instructions, refusing to speak or cooperate with courtroom protocol. On Sunday, attorneys representing them told reporters that the proceedings had been unfair to their clients. They criticized restrictions that they said prevented them from discussing topics like torture. ""We are hamstrung ... before we ever start,"" said David Nevin, who is representing Mohammed. ""The system is a rigged game to prevent us from doing our jobs."" Martins said he strongly disagreed with that assessment. ""They can talk to their clients about anything,"" he said. On Saturday, silence from the defendants -- some of whom ignored the judge, while others appeared to be reading -- slowed the proceedings to a crawl. Bin 'Attash was wheeled into the courtroom in a restraining chair. It was unclear why he was the only defendant brought into court in that manner, though he was allowed out of restraints after he promised not to disrupt court proceedings. Toward the end of the day, he took off his shirt while his attorney was describing injuries she alleged he sustained while in custody. The judge told bin 'Attash, ""No!"" and warned that he would be removed from the courtroom if he did not follow directions. At one point, bin 'Attash made a paper airplane and placed it on top of a microphone. It was removed after a translator complained about the sound the paper made against the microphone. Hours into Saturday's proceeding, one of the defendants broke his silence with an outburst. Bin al-Shibh shouted in heavily accented English: ""You may not see us anymore,"" he said. ""They are going to kill us."" During recesses, the five men talked amongst each other and appeared relaxed. They passed around a copy of The Economist. Bin al-Shibh appeared to lead the group twice in prayer in the courtroom, once delaying the resumption of the hearing. Mohammed, whose long beard appeared to be dyed red by henna, was much thinner than the last time he was seen publicly in a courtroom. The judge, Col. James Pohl, needed the five to vocally confirm their desire to be represented by the attorneys who accompanied them to court. Because the defendants refused to cooperate, Pohl ruled the men would continue to be represented by their current military and civilian attorneys. All five men are charged with terrorism, hijacking aircraft, conspiracy, murder in violation of the law of war, attacking civilians, attacking civilian objects, intentionally causing serious bodily injury and destruction of property in violation of the law of war. If convicted, they face the death penalty. There were so many allegations behind the charges, it took more than two hours for officers of the court just to read into the record the details of the 9/11 hijackings. The reading of the charges ""provided a stirring reminder of the importance of the case,"" Martins said Sunday. ""For so many people involved in this trial, the pursuit of justice is worth every moment spent,"" he said. The next hearing is scheduled for June 12. It will likely be at least a year before the case goes to trial, Pohl said. The charges allege that the five are ""responsible for the planning and execution of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, in New York, Washington, D.C., and Shanksville, Pa., resulting in the killing of 2,976 people,"" the Defense Department said. Though Mohammed confessed to organizing the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington, his confession could be called into question during a trial. A 2005 Justice Department memo -- released by the Obama administration -- revealed he had been waterboarded 183 times in March 2003. The technique, which simulates drowning, has been called torture by President Barack Obama and others. The military initially charged Mohammed in 2008, but Obama stopped the case as part of his effort to close the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay. Unable to close the center, Obama attempted to move the case to federal court in New York in 2009, only to run into a political firestorm. The plan was dropped after complaints about cost and security, and Attorney General Eric Holder announced in April 2011 that the five would face a military trial at Guantanamo Bay. The decision was met with some criticism, including from the American Civil Liberties Union. ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero said last month that the administration is making a ""terrible mistake by prosecuting the most important terrorism trials of our time in a second-tier system of justice.""","A 9/11 victim's brother says the arraignment ""brought up all the old memories"" of the attacks .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: I'm Carl Azuz and today, CNN Student News shows you what it looks like when the lights go down in the city. But our journey through today's headlines starts in Libya. First Up: Libya Civil War . AZUZ: And our first subject: who is leading the coalition military operation in that north African country. The U.S. has been in charge. But a deal was worked out over the weekend for NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, to take responsibility for running the operation. The first part of that, NATO enforcing the no-fly zone over Libya, is scheduled to happen today. On the ground, Libyan forces are fighting against rebels who want Libya's leader, Colonel Moammar Gadhafi, out of power. The rebels were pushing westward over the weekend and taking control of some key cities along the way. But in others, the fighting between rebels and military forces is fierce. President Obama is scheduled to give a speech tonight about the situation in Libya. That'll happen at 7:30 ET. Crisis in Japan . AZUZ: Over in Japan, we're getting some conflicting reports about the radiation coming out of a damaged nuclear power plant. Early Sunday, tests showed that one building at the plant was giving off radiation levels 10 million times more than normal. Tokyo Electric, which owns the plant, later said the number was closer to 100,000 times normal level. The problems at the plant started with the earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan a little over two weeks ago. In this YouTube video, you can see the impact of that tsunami. The water is rushing over the barrier, flooding a road. Then, it starts sweeping across a parking lot filled with cars. At this point, the flood is pouring in so fast you can't even see the barrier. And those cars are tossed around like toys in a tub, smashed up against the side of a building. This is how an entire town can be washed away. Eventually, the force of the water, the force of the cars, one building is just ripped off its foundation and floats away. It might seem strange to talk about a Cherry Blossom Festival in relation to the crisis in Japan. But the annual event in Washington, D.C. highlights the relationship between the U.S. and Japan. And this year, people used the festival to show their support for victims halfway around the world. (BEGIN VIDEO) DANIELLE PIACENTE, COMMUNICATIONS MANAGER, NATIONAL CHERRY BLOSSOM FESTIVAL: We thought it was a really good time to bring everyone together in a show of solidarity and support for the people of Japan in this great time of need. ICHIRO FUJISAKI, JAPANESE AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES: This a very tough fight. But the consolation is that people around the world are trying to be with us. NORITAKA TAKEZAWA, JAPANESE-AMERICAN: Cherry Blossom Festival, cherry blossom is always special for us. But this year, the Cherry Blossom Festival is very, very special. Japanese people, we need to restore our country again. For that, we need a lot of support, especially American support. A hundred years ago, Japanese people sent cherry blossoms to the United States. And after a hundred years, still blooming. And that represent our friendships. MAYA WALSH, JAPANESE-AMERICAN: My mother is Japanese, and I thought this is a good way to help support the efforts. My culture is really important to me, and I'm really proud to be out here with everyone. KAZU KOYAMA, JAPANESE-AMERICAN: I just want the people of Japan to know that the people of the United States, from the bottom of their hearts, ordinary Americans truly and genuinely care for the Japanese people. And I hope that message can be brought to them through this festival. (END VIDEO) Sound Check . GERALDINE FERRARO, 1984 DEMOCRATIC VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I want to thank Fritz Mondale for asking the convention to nominate me as his running mate. This choice says a lot about him, about where the country has come, and about where we want to lead it. Fritz called my road here, the classic American dream. He's right. Remembering Ferraro . AZUZ: Geraldine Ferraro, talking in 1984 about her nomination as the U.S. Democratic vice presidential candidate. Ferraro made history as the first female VP candidate from a major political party. Her running mate, Walter Mondale, said he picked her because ""she's smart, she knows the issues, she believes in social justice."" Mondale and Ferraro didn't win the election. But 10 years later, Ferraro was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in recognition of her accomplishments and contributions to American society. Geraldine Ferraro died on Saturday from complications from blood cancer. She was 75 years old. Nuclear Plant Tour . AZUZ: The name Three Mile Island might not sound very familiar to you, but it probably does to your parents and teachers. On this day in 1979, Three Mile Island was the site of the most serious nuclear accident in U.S. history. With the crisis going on in Japan, some people are asking about the safety of nuclear facilities in the U.S. David Mattingly is here to give us a tour of one. (BEGIN VIDEO) DAVID MATTINGLY, CNN NEWS CORRESPONDENT: This is a rare look at the inner workings of a nuclear plant, this one owned by TVA, the Tennessee Valley Authority, at Browns Ferry. They're opening up this tour today because they want to reassure the public that what happened in Japan could not happen here. This nuclear plant was built to generate electricity the same way as the stricken Fukushima Daiichi plant. But operators here say redundant layers of generators and batteries would keep the critical systems running after a catastrophe. This is a very interesting place right here. Just step through right here and right below my feet is a thousand pounds of pressurized steam. I'm standing right on top of one of the reactors. Shutting it down in an emergency is easy. Keeping the nuclear fuel from overheating, though, was a problem in Japan. This is the pool where spent fuel rods are kept cool, just like the one that malfunctioned in the Japanese plant. Fire hoses are strung nearby to pump water into the pool manually if all systems fail. PRESTON SWAFFORD, TVA CHIEF NUCLEAR OFFICER: You can never in our business say ever, positively, because I think the Japanese may have said the same thing. But I'll tell you, I don't believe we're going to have a 43-foot high wall of water that's going to hit this interior plant inside in the state of Alabama. MATTINGLY: This big red area is a huge reservoir of water that sits underneath the reactor. The water in here is then pumped into the reactor in emergency situations. What I want to show you is right here, that piece of metal right there that looks like a shock absorber for your car. That's a shock absorber for this reactor. It's called a snubber, and it goes into operation in case there's an earthquake. This plant is designed to withstand a 6.0 earthquake and a million-year flood on the Tennessee River. One big change after watching what happened in Japan: operators of this plant and others are going back to the drawing board to decide if they have figured out what is their worst-case scenario. They'll be playing a very long game of ""what if"" to determine if they've got it right. David Mattingley, CNN, Browns Ferry, Alabama. (END VIDEO) Blog Report . AZUZ: Our blog asked what you thought of a Florida school's rules to accommodate a student with a life-threatening peanut allergy. If you haven't seen that report, you can find Friday's show.  It's in our archive at CNNStudentNews.com. Zayne says ""the rules go overboard. The student should be homeschooled; her parents are making the whole school go through a lot of hassle.""  Colin calls protesting the new rules ""petty."" He can't believe some parents refuse to suffer the minor inconveniences mentioned to protect the welfare of a young girl. The results of our quick poll: 44 percent of you called the new rules appropriate; 56 percent said they go too far. Shannon says ""the child deserves to be safe at school. The regulations on her classmates should be seen as compassion, not an inconvenience."" Effie asks ""why other people have to be responsible for another child's health issue,"" and says her sister has the same problem and was taught early how to handle it herself. Perspective from Zackson: ""Think about how the allergic girl must be feeling. All these new rules because of her -- that must be embarrassing."" Before We Go . AZUZ: Our last story today is a dark one, but for a good reason. It's Earth Hour! Cities around the world flipped the switch this past Saturday, turning off their lights for one hour at 8:30 p.m. The event started a few years ago in Australia. It's designed to raise awareness about environmental issues. Last year, more than 100 countries participated. If you want to get involved with all this, you better be serious about going dark. Goodbye . AZUZ: Because once you've committed to Earth Hour, you can't black out. A little pun to lighten the mood. That story was lights out! And so are we.

"(CNN) -- A porn actor suspected of killing and dismembering a university student in Montreal ""trusts the Canadian judicial system,"" his attorney said after a hearing Thursday afternoon. Luka Rocco Magnotta faces first-degree murder and other charges in the death and dismemberment of Jun Lin, a 33-year-old Concordia University student from China. The 29-year-old Magnotta has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Magnotta appeared at his initial court appearance Tuesday via video link for security reasons but appeared in person for Thursday afternoon's hearing, said Jean Pascal Boucher, a spokesman for the Quebec prosecutor's office. ""The information we get is that he was asked to be there by his counsel,"" Boucher said. Authorities accuse Magnotta of dismembering Lin and mailing his hand and foot to Canadian politicians. Police also believe Magnotta filmed the death and dismemberment and posted the video to the Internet. They have said the video shows Magnotta engaged in sexual acts involving body parts and includes evidence of cannibalism. Investigators say Magnotta fled to France and then Germany, where he was arrested while browsing articles about himself at an Internet cafe in Berlin. Magnotta did not fight extradition and was flown back to Canada on Monday. ""Mr. Magnotta waived his rights to extradition because he wanted to come back to Montreal,"" said his attorney, Luc Leclair. ""He trusts the Canadian judicial system.""

"Atlanta (CNN) -- ""Aimee Day"" can't come soon enough. That is the holiday -- date still to be determined -- Andy Copeland hopes for as his daughter Aimee fights off virulent flesh-eating bacteria that turned her life upside down in less than two weeks. Her fight won't be over on Aimee Day. She will likely need dialysis for some time to help her kidneys function, and rehab to adjust to life without her left leg, part of her abdomen and perhaps other body parts that surgeons may still remove because of her disease. Still, on that day, the 24-year-old University of West Georgia graduate student should be able to breathe on her own, after medical staff remove a tube now stuck down her throat that is being used to regulate her oxygen level. And her parents and her sister should, again, hear her voice. ""We're going to celebrate that day forever for the rest of your life,"" Andy Copeland told his daughter as she lay heavily medicated in an Augusta, Georgia, hospital bed. ""It's the day that my daughter was delivered from this horrible, horrible disease."" Speaking Sunday on CNN, Andy Copeland didn't go into detail about the latest on his daughter's condition as she fights for her life beyond saying, ""We're holding up very well here."" Yet, as he's done in regular Facebook posts chronicling the ordeal, Andy Copeland was positive about the future. ""I have every confidence that Aimee will be able to overcome this,"" he said. Just last month, she had a full and active life. Aimee was pursuing her master's degree in psychology, with a focus on eco-psychology -- the idea that harmonizing with nature can be a powerful tool in ensuring one's psychological health and vitality. On May 1, she and some friends were out near the Little Tallapoosa River, about 50 miles west of Atlanta, when she grabbed onto a homemade zip line, her family has said. It snapped. That led to a gash in her left calf, and ultimately it took 22 staples to close the wound, according to CNN affiliate WSB. Athough she didn't know it at the time, it was because of that cut that Aimee Copeland contracted the flesh-devouring bacteria, Aeromonas hydrophila. Dr. Buddy Creech, an assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University, said that Aeromonas hydrophila -- which is ""remarkably common in the water and in the environment"" -- is one of many bacteria that can cause a flesh-eating process. ""When it gets into those deeper tissues, it has a remarkable ability to destroy the tissues that surround it in sort of this hunt for nutrition,"" Creech said. ""When it does that, those tissues die, and you see the inflammation and the swelling and the destruction that can be very difficult to control."" Most humans are affected by these bacteria by swallowing them, resulting in diarrhea. Aimee Copeland's case was much more uncommon, in that her wound got ""infected and the infection (ran) wild,"" explained Creech. The pain continued for Aimee after her accident and, on May 4, a friend took her to an emergency room where she was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis and flown to Augusta for surgery. She went into cardiac arrest after being removed from the operating table, but was resuscitated, CNN affiliate WGCL reported. It was then, Andy Copeland recalled on his Facebook page, that he was ""told that Aimee might not survive the night."" She did survive, though surgeries cost her the leg and part of her abdomen. A post Saturday on a blog set up by the University of West Georgia psychology department said more operations are coming: ""Aimee will suffer the loss of her fingers, however physicians have hope of bringing life back to the palms of her hands, which could allow her the muscle control to use helpful prosthetics."" At one point her lungs ""required 100% pure oxygen to be fed to her through a respirator,"" as the bacteria ravaged her body, her father wrote. By Sunday, she had improved significantly to 33% -- just 12 percentage points shy of 21%, the level of oxygen in air around us. If and when it gets to that point, she can be taken off the respirator. And her family can mark that moment, Aimee Day, on their collective calendar to celebrate this year and every year after. For now, Andy Copeland is busy standing by, conversing with medical staff and expressing appreciation for his ""amazingly resilient"" daughter, as well as for the medical staff, friends and complete strangers who have shown their support. And the entire family is staying hopeful, fueled in part by the remarkable progress they've seen so far. ""The words I hear from the medical professionals to describe Aimee's continued recovery are 'astonishing,' 'incredible,' 'confounding,' 'mind-boggling' and 'unbelievable,'"" Andy Copeland wrote Saturday on Facebook. ""All those are fitting words. My favorite word is 'miracle.'"" CNN's Don Lemon and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","Aimee Copeland, 24, was infected with Aeromonas hydrophila on May 1 .

"(EW) -- Once upon a time, ""Newsies"" was a movie musical starring Christian Bale that flopped at the box office and with critics when it was released by The Walt Disney Company in 1992. Today, ""Newsies"" is a lauded Broadway musical smash starring Jeremy Jordan in the role played by Bale in the film, which despite failure inspired a passionate cult of fans who call themselves ""Fansies."" No one is more surprised by this turn of events than Bale himself. ""These things never make any sense,"" the Oscar-winning actor and Hollywood's current Batman told EW in a recent interview. ""I'm incredibly happy for them. They're having the success our movie never had."" In case you're not a ""Fansie"" and your memory of the movie has dimmed like faded newsprint, Newsies was set against the historical backdrop of the New York City newsboy strike of 1899 and featured songs by Alan Menken and J.A.C. Redford. Bale was 17 years old when he played the part of 17-year-old Jack Kelly, who hawked copies of the New York World with tactics as dubious and gotcha! as the era's yellow journalism. When media moguls Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst decided to make their newspaper boys pay more for the papers they sell, Jack rallied his fellow paperboys to strike. Complications ensued, resolution was achieved, and the ""Newsies"" danced. In 2011, Disney Theatrical Productions began work on a stage version with songs by Menken and Jack Feldman and a book by Harvey Fierstein. ""Newsies The Musical"" opened on Broadway last March to sell-outs and acclaim. It earned eight Tony nominations and won two (best choreography, best original score). No, Bale hasn't seen the show Ã¢â¬â and he says he has no plans to do so. Why? ""I'm not really into musicals,"" Bale responded. ""But I wish them the best. And I'm sure the person playing the character I played exceeded whatever I did, and congratulations to them."" Would it be personally difficult to watch another actor perform the part, and perform it with greater success? ""No, no, no. That wouldn't be hard. I'm going to be having to do it with Batman,"" says Bale, whose final turn as the caped crusader, ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" opens July 20. Referring to reports that Warner Bros. intends to quickly reboot the Batman franchise with a new director and star, Bale adds: ""They're going to rejuvenate it soon, and I'll have to be watching someone else play Batman. I'll be fascinated. I'll be fascinated to see which way they go, which choices that actor makes."" Unless, of course, the new Batman sings. See full story at EW.com.

"Alexandria, Virginia (CNN) -- A Moroccan man accused of plotting a suicide bomb attack on the U.S. Capitol pleaded guilty Friday afternoon to a charge of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction against government property. In the plea agreement, Amine El Khalifi, 29, agreed to a prison sentence with a maximum of 25 to 30 years. If he had been convicted in a trial, he could have been sentenced to life behind bars. U.S. District Judge James Cacheris set a sentencing date of September 14. El Khalifi came to the courtroom wearing a jail jumpsuit with the word ""prisoner"" stenciled on the back. He was not in restraints. He appeared relaxed and politely answered the judge when asked to confirm his guilty plea and other questions. The judge accepted the plea and found him guilty. El Khalifi was arrested February 17 as the result of an FBI sting operation. According to a statement of facts signed by El Khalifi, he accepted what he thought was a suicide vest containing explosives and a MAC-10 automatic gun. He put on the vest and was quickly taken into custody as he attempted to leave a parking garage and walk toward the Capitol building. ""Unbeknownst to El Khalifi, both the weapon and the bomb had been rendered inoperable by law enforcement,"" according to court documents. El Khalifi told an undercover FBI agent and another man assisting law enforcement agents that he intended to use the MAC-10 to ""shoot people before detonating the bomb."" El Khalifi thought he was working with al Qaeda, but a man referred to in court documents as ""Yusuf"" was an undercover agent. U.S. officials said El Khalifi had been closely monitored, and the public was never in danger. The U.S. officials also said he was not connected to terrorists and was working alone. According to the statement of facts, El Khalifi changed his mind about what to target and at various points had considered hitting a restaurant, a military installation and a synagogue. He finally decided to try to blow himself up in the Capitol, according to the court document, and said ""he would be happy killing 30 people."" El Khalifi admitted performing surveillance at the Capitol and asking an associate named Hussien who was secretly assisting law enforcement to remotely detonate the bomb if El Khalifi ran into problems with security officers. ""He absolutely was the real deal,"" U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride said after the court hearing. MacBride said El Khalifi chose his targets and weapons, thought he was a working with al Qaeda and wanted to carry out ""the first-ever suicide attack in the U.S."" FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Bryan Paarmann said El Khalifi is another yet another homegrown extremist, although he did not offer a theory on why he became radicalized. According to Paarmann, El Khalifi ""had the intent, the disposition and the desire"" to commit acts of violence. El Khalifi came to the United States in June 1999 on a B2 visa, which allows visitors for tourism and medical treatment. But U.S. officials said El Khalifi's visa expired the same year, and he has been in the country illegally ever since. A condition of El Khalifi's plea agreement is that he will be deported to Morocco after he serves his prison sentence.","Amine El Khalifi, 29, was arrested February 17 as the result of an FBI sting operation .

"(CNN) -- The pictures of Tokuyoshi Takahashi's fish processing factory in northeastern Japan taken after March 11, 2011 illustrate just how destructive the tsunami was. A ship was swept on to land by the giant wave and left stranded against the front of the factory, while entire sections of wall collapsed, leaving twisted metal and debris protruding from inside. Takahashi estimated the catastrophe caused US$19 million worth of damage to his business, Takatoku , which processes fish for major supermarket chains across Japan. He was forced to lay off all of his 120 employees. ""I set a goal right after the quake,"" he said. ""All the staff would be back by January 1."" iReport: Share your stories about last year's disaster . Three months after that deadline and he's almost there. Seventy are now back at work and he expects that number to rise to 100 by March. Though he's found many of his old employees, some have left the city all together to find work elsewhere. Takahashi is one of a small group of businessman determined to rebuild Ishinomaki, a city of around 150,000 on the coast of northeastern Japan. The tsunami caused widespread damage here, knocking down homes and wiping out the fishing port and processing factories that account for 30% of the jobs in the city. With no jobs and no homes, many have left for bigger cities like Sendai or Tokyo. The survival of the fishing industry here is deeply intertwined with that of the city itself. A year on and progress has been slow. Kunio Suno, president of the Ishinomaki Fish Market is one of city's most determined champions, spearheading the effort to create a newer and better port. He says fishing volumes are still at just a fifth of what they were before March 11, and fisherman have nowhere to sell their catch without the processing plants. His biggest frustration is with the pace of the recovery. The national government insists on following the normal -- but lengthy -- approval process for the rebuilding plans, rather than fast-tracking proposals as an emergency case. ""There is a huge gap between our feelings and those of Tokyo,"" he said. Only two weeks ago Ishinomaki's local government announced plans to rebuild the fishing industry at a cost US$1.5 billion, including support for small and medium fish processing plants. It will take three year to complete. Suno's vision for the fish market is even more ambitious. He wants to expand beyond the commercial auction and add restaurants to attract tourists, like similar sites in Sydney and Seattle. As for the processing plants, Takahashi believes only two of his competitors are back in full operation. He says others have struggled to raise capital or to rebuild the land under their factories, which sunk a meter in the disaster. His hope is that Ishinomaki can attract investors to the rebuilding process so that people can be convinced to move back. For Suno, convincing people to stay and work in Ishinomaki is about more than saving the city he's lived in for twenty years. It is less about money and more about saving a way of life. ""If this industry is gone, people will have to go to Tokyo and they will be without a true home,"" he said.","Ishinomaki was just one of many Japanese towns hit hard by last year's earthquake and tsunami .

"London (CNN) -- A huge collection of papers belonging to pioneering scientist Sir Isaac Newton -- the father of gravity -- has been posted online by Cambridge University. The archive includes Newton's college notebooks and some of his most important writings from the 1660s on mathematics and calculus, optics and gravity. They appear alongside an annotated copy of ""Principia Mathematica,"" the book in which Newton set out his laws of motion and gravity, and which is regarded as one of the world's most significant scientific works. More than 4,000 pages of Newton material have been digitized so far, with archivists photographing and uploading as many as 200 pages a day. Grant Young, the library's digitization manager, said the collection contained ""perhaps some of the most important papers and documents in the history of science,"" which would give viewers a valuable insight into Newton's working methods. ""Anyone, wherever they are, can see at the click of a mouse how Newton worked and how he went about developing his theories and experiments,"" he said. ""Before today, anyone who wanted to see these things had to come to Cambridge. Now we're bringing Cambridge University Library to the world."" Many of the papers -- some of them badly damaged by fire or water -- have undergone delicate conservation work before being added to the archive. They are also accompanied by transcriptions by the University of Sussex's Newton Project, allowing readers to decipher Newton's handwriting. But some of the notes added to the papers over the years suggest some of the scientist's contemporaries may not have approved of the online publication. Several of the manuscripts contain the line ""not fit to be printed,"" written by Thomas Pellet, who was asked to review Newton's work after his death. The Newton archive is part of Cambridge's Digital Library project that will eventually showcase other important scientific papers, including the works of Charles Darwin, Lord Kelvin and Ernest Rutherford. Part of Darwin's personal library of hundreds of books -- many of them packed with the scientist's notes in the margins -- is already online.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Omar Suleiman, the Egyptian vice president under Hosni Mubarak who announced the president's resignation to the world, has died in a U.S. hospital at age 76, officials said Thursday. A family member said the former spy chief had ""water on his lungs and suffered heart problems that led to his death after his health deteriorated in the past three weeks."" He had traveled to Germany for medical reasons before for traveling Monday to a medical center in Cleveland. Suleiman died early Thursday with his family at his side at the Cleveland Clinic, which announced that his death was due to ""complications from amyloidosis, a disease that affects multiple organs including the heart and kidneys."" His body was to arrive Friday morning in Egypt and his funeral was to be held after prayers, relatives said. Head of Egypt's powerful intelligence services, Suleiman also served as vice president under Mubarak before his ouster. In a somber one-minute television announcement in February 2011, Suleiman announced that Mubarak had resigned his post as president and declared that the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces would run the country's affairs. Timeline: Unrest in Egypt . The announcement followed an 18-day popular uprising in Egypt that saw tens of thousands take to the streets to demand Mubarak's ouster. Suleiman most recently made headlines when he entered the race for Egypt's first democratically elected president in the eleventh hour and then failed to gather enough signatures required to be on the ballot. He was disqualified from the election by a panel that included members connected to the Mubarak regime, which suggested that his elimination from the presidential race was not politically motivated. Suleiman had headed Egypt's intelligence since 1993, maintained close CIA ties and was often criticized by rights groups for his heavy-handed approach with suspected militants. Born into poverty in the Egyptian town of Qena, he enrolled in the country's prestigious military academy and was decorated for his performance in the wars against Israel in 1967 and 1973. In June 1995, both Suleiman and Mubarak survived an assassination attempt during an African summit in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa.

"(CNN) -- Egyptian security services in North Sinai are intensifying efforts to get a pair of kidnapped Americans and their tour guide released, state media reported Saturday. The push comes after authorities received confirmation that the trio was still in the area where they were abducted. Their detention was intended to bargain the release of relatives in custody of Egyptian authorities, EgyNews reported. Security sources ""confirmed that continuous efforts are being made in order to determine the whereabouts of the Americans and the Egyptian tour guide on one hand, and to release them in coordination with tribal leaders and the families in the region,"" EgyNews said. The tourists and their guide were kidnapped Friday in the Sinai region of Egypt, authorities said. The family of one of the kidnapped Americans identified their loved one as Michel Louis, a pastor from Dorchester, Massachusetts. Louis was traveling with a group of clergy and church members when their vehicle was stopped and he, another member and their tour guide were detained, the Louis family said in a statement. Louis' son, Jean, told reporters his father is a diabetic. He thanked everyone involved in trying to secure his release and asked that people pray for his safe return, and the safe return of those with him. ""We're all in good spirits because we know that the God that we serve is in control of the matter,"" the son said. He confirmed the identity of the other tourist, a woman, as Lisa Alphonse.

"Editor's note: Jim Shepard, author of ""You Think That's Bad,"" honors the kind of mothers who never, ever hold back, especially when it comes to love, yelling and dandelion sandwiches. (Oprah.com) -- My mother was born Ida Picarazzi in Strangolagalli, Italy, a town whose name roughly translates as ""strangle the rooster,"" and if you were to meet my mother, you'd think: ""Of course that's where she's from."" An observer could tell from a low-flying aircraft that my mother comes from what used to be called hearty peasant stock, and when it comes to both the social niceties and interacting with her family, Ida has always had the touch of a blacksmith. When agitated, she's something to behold, and she's almost always agitated. She has a voice that could knock squirrels from trees. I remember a boy who lived two streets over remarking on the bus to school that he'd heard me being disciplined the day before. She's half-deaf, or by now more than half-deaf, thanks to a punctured eardrum from childhood, which means that even when she's trying to be discreet -- say, when sitting in a theater and needing help with a movie's plot -- those all around her, in a wide, wide circle, have the uncanny impression that Ida is talking directly to them. A few years ago, at her 80th birthday, I found myself wondering where to begin, when celebrating her. There are so many lessons that I realize I've learned from Ida's examples -- positive and negative -- over the years: The importance of calm. The advantages of beating your children with a wooden spoon as opposed to a metal one. And here's a good rule of thumb, for those of you who might wonder what it's like to grow up with a mother who A) was raised in a particularly poverty-stricken region of Italy and B) lived through the Great Depression: You're going to learn some lessons about frugality from a woman who eats dandelion sandwiches. Oprah.com: Why every happy person needs a Greek mom . Without Ida, I also probably wouldn't be a writer. One characteristic of writers is a playfulness with words -- and boy, is being around Ida a crash course in that. She has, over the years, told her children to stay away from strange animals in the woods, because those animals could bite you and give you rabbis. She's told us that someone she knew was well-off because he had an ingrown swimming pool. She's told us, when unable to decide about something, that she didn't care; that as far as she was concerned, it was eight of one or a half dozen of another. She's told us that her brother Guido was so generous he'd give you the skin off his back. She told a friend of mine that one of my favorite monster movies when I was a kid was ""King Kong vs. Gonzales."" And how's this for an unexpectedly highbrow contribution that my mother made to my life: Maybe more than anyone I know, she's demonstrated just how mysterious a thing identity really is. Who are we, really? Can we ever really know? My mother has had a hilariously hard time keeping names and faces straight, even within her own nuclear family. Over the years, she's called me Guido, Mario, Johnny, Agnes, Jean and Hey You. But it wasn't that it was she was distracted; it was that she was so excited about the things that other people take for granted. As in: ""Oh, my God, Guido, come look: A MONKEY ON TV!"" Oprah.com: Jodi Picoult's rules for life . So you can imagine how surprised I was the first time I came home from college and found Ida sitting at the kitchen table with an unsettling smile on her face. My mother... silent? At first, she refused to explain why. Then she said, ""Go look at your room."" I went upstairs. I looked at my room. The floor was covered with a bright purple wall-to-wall shag rug. The walls were a deep lavender. The furniture had been stained a dark purple. I came back downstairs, and she was still smiling. ""Why is my room all purple?"" I asked. ""The Vikings,"" she answered. ""Why is my room all purple?"" I asked again. ""You like the Minnesota Vikings,"" she explained, as though I'd forgotten. ""I like to watch them play,"" I said. ""I don't want to live inside their color."" This seems to me a quintessential Ida story, full of both over-the-top lunacy and love. I always find it moving how tireless she is in all her efforts to please. She hunted up, somewhere, a dark-purple stain and lugged all of my furniture downstairs and outside and stained it all and then lugged it all the way back upstairs. Probably my poor father was recruited, as well. It took her hours, if not days, to make my room that ugly. Oprah.com: 12 things Meghan O'Rouke wishes she could tell her mom . There are advantages, when it comes to engaging the world, to having a mother with the touch of a blacksmith. My father, now stricken with short-term memory loss, was considered by most of his friends and family to be one of the more anxious people they ever encountered. Ida worked relentlessly for decades to build bridges between her erratic kids -- who sometimes did things that seemed to suggest that we had the collective brains of a squirrel -- and her husband, who clearly preferred that we stay packed in cotton in a box until we were 21. She worked night and day to carve out a space in which we could go out into the world and screw up. And naturally, being who we were, we obliged her. There is no one else from whom I could have learned so much about the advantages of being emotionally forthright and about the pleasures of making that emotional forthrightness vivid. You always know where Ida stands on things, whether it's the bigheartedness of her family (a frequent subject that brings her to tears when she considers how little it's appreciated by the rest of the world) or the horrors of waste (That's a sin, she'll say if anyone leaves anything that resembles food on their plate. When Ida cleans a bone, it looks as if army ants have been all over it.) Once, when I was when I was 14 or so and we were arguing about something, I teased her that she didn't love me, and she started whacking me on the arm and back as hard as she could, one whack for each syllable, while she yelled, ""Don't you tell me that I don't love you!"" She was going to love me no matter what, even if she was going to have to beat me to death to prove it. There's no one who could have better demonstrated the importance of unconditional love. Oprah.com: Motherhood: What endless love feels like . Ida Picarazzi was my first real supporter, mentor and teacher. Who would have guessed it? Not me, at least not for the longest time. I should have, though. What could be more compelling, after all, than a Force of Nature? Ida is a continual reminder not to do things halfway, to give oneself over to the world with a passionate intensity. I knew they loved each other, but my parents fought so much when I was a kid that when no one was yelling in the house I found myself wondering if someone had died. And yet my brother and I have been unbelievably lucky to have been in the track of her storm. Wherever she's passed, sure, there are branches down and leaves all over the place, but the clouds look washed and beautiful, and the sky is beginning to clear. And the storm itself, we soon realize, has been mesmerizing, has been galvanizing and has been just what was necessary to shake us into feeling what anyone who's spent any time around Ida has always felt: as though they've really lived through something.

"Katsurashima, Japan (CNN) -- The dock on Katsurashima Island off the coast of Japan's Miyagi prefecture has sunk by half a meter because of last year's Great East Japan earthquake. Walking along the cracked and sandbagged quayside, oyster farmer Yoshimasa Koizumi spies his fishing gear that has been lying untouched for over a year. In fact the 37-year-old has never used it to fish with; he moved from Tokyo to Katsurashima, part of the Urato Islands, just one day before the devastating tsunami struck. Koizumi was safe on a bridge when the huge black wall of water swept almost all before it, destroying his new fishing boat and making the house he had spent only one night in uninhabitable. He's one of thousands whose homes and livelihoods were ruined. The Japanese government has estimated that around 90% of fishing boats from Iwate , Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures were destroyed by the tsunami. ""In a way, (the tsunami) has made it easier to fit into the community,"" he said, mentioning how lifelong residents of the islands are often quite insular. ""A positive thing was that it made everyone come together. I was an outsider and many were kind to me."" The quiet life Koizumi hoped for after quitting a job at a lumber company in Tokyo is still to be realized, and some residents of Katsurashima don't think fishing, a way of life for all on the Urato Islands and livelihood for most of the communities along the Northeast coast of Japan, is possible anymore. ""There's not much future for fishing here,"" said 75-year-old former fisherman Mr. Keikichi, a lifelong resident of Katsurashima. However Koizumi sees things differently. Even though only one oyster processing factory is still functioning and a third of fishermen of the Urato Islands remain, he is determined to revive his new community and create a sustainable fishing industry. Just a month after the tsunami, Koizumi set up ""Uminoko Saisei"" (Children of the Sea), a cooperative project for fishermen from the Urato Islands and outside ""stakeholders."" The stakeholders' donations to help the area's recovery will eventually be repaid with fishermen's produce like oysters and seaweed. Koizumi used Twitter and Facebook to promote the project, and since April 2011 over 14,000 people from across the world have sent donations. ""I didn't want (fishermen on the islands) to quit,"" he said. ""I wasn't a fisherman before. It's very hard to be a fisherman. If I could succeed, it could help those who quit to come back."" But Koizumi's plan hasn't been without some controversy. Some of his ideas have been hard for some of the established fishermen and the local Fisherman's Guild to digest. ""At first many local fishermen didn't have a clue what I was doing, like planning some innovative ideas and selling to new markets. It has taken time to convince them. ""Before, let's just say that communication didn't happen often between islanders,"" he said, explaining that the Fisherman's Guild had a tight hold on how fishing was regulated and before the tsunami most fishermen operated as individuals. More than half of Miyagi Prefecture's fishermen are over 50, but some of the younger residents of the Urato Islands are happy to follow Koizumi's lead. Mr. Yoshinori Suzuki, who returned to the area from Yokohama to help his father's fishing business on nearby Nonoshima Island, says he's open to Koizumi's plans, but he currently has to work in construction as well fishing to make a living. The tsunami has actually made this a good year for the bay's oyster beds, as it brought in nutrients from the deep ocean, although this year's harvest will still be half what was produced before the tsunami. Forecasts are for oyster and seaweed production to return to pre-tsunami levels by 2014, but if the bay's sea life is sure to recover, the life for those ashore is much less certain. Even Koizumi's project has changed from what he first thought it would be. While support from individuals and NGOs has been forthcoming, the Children of the Sea Foundation was created to help manage the project and Japanese medical company Tokibo became a partner. Executives from the company now sit on the board, along with Koizumi and members from the Urato Islands Fisherman's Guild. It's part of a wider phenomenon of companies in Japan partnering or helping previously independent communities or cooperatives affected by the earthquake. ""Many companies want to help the communities recover, but after two years when the local economy gets better, who knows what may happen,"" said Professor Masahiro Yamao of Hiroshima University, who has studied the economics of post-tsunami recovery plans. ""Some companies may want more and more return for their investment,"" he added. ""But you can't say what is right or wrong for these communities, they are all quite different, some more isolated than others, some more damaged than others. Many traditional communities will be okay without companies, so there is no one solution."" The simple life of a fisherman still eludes Koizumi, administering the Foundation now takes nearly all of his time. ""Now there are lots of different opinions, and it makes it much more difficult,"" he said. ""I just want to be able to prepare my own boat and fish."" Unfortunately that day still seems a long way off.","Urato Islands off coast of Miyagi Prefecture a microcosm of troubles affecting fishing communities .

"(CNN) -- Does anyone really want to be Fernando Alonso's teammate at Ferrari? Okay, it won't be like it was with Michael Schumacher between 1996 and 2006 when he was the undisputed number one in the team, but whoever ends up there will be playing -- at best -- second fiddle. Perhaps that's one of the reasons why Mark Webber, who was touted as a possible Ferrari driver, has signed up to race alongside two-time Formula One champion Sebastian Vettel for another year at Red Bull. Webber led for much of the 2010 world championship only to lose out to Vettel at the season's end, but last year he was completely overshadowed: one win to the German's 11, and that came in the final grand prix when his younger teammate had a gearbox problem and let him through. This year, though, he's had the measure of Vettel -- he's 16 points ahead in second place overall after heading off Alonso and Vettel to win the British Grand Prix, and he's arguably getting on better with this year's Red Bull. Webber pips Alonso to take British Grand Prix . You'd put your money on the Australian having a better race than his 25-year-old colleague at this weekend's German Grand Prix. And that's before you look at Vettel's record in his home event, which consists of two podiums, but no win. Rewind to 2009, and this race is where Webber won his very first grand prix at the age of 32 -- though that year it was held at Nurburgring; this weekend it will be at Hockenheim, as the venues alternate. Red Bull's designer Adrian Newey admitted that Webber was absolutely gutted to miss the championship in 2010, so much so that he brought some of that negative feeling into the next season. However, the reason for his troubles last year were even more basic than that. The winning Formula for success? 2011 was the year of the exhaust-blown diffuser -- a system whereby the designers managed to get the exhausts to ""blow"" over the rear diffuser even when the driver didn't have their foot on the throttle. This created a significant amount of downforce and extra grip, meaning the cars cornered like they were on rails and the drivers got less feedback through the steering wheel. Webber wasn't a fan, unlike Vettel -- who changed his style to suit the new characteristics. Not only did Webber struggle to get the best out of the super-grippy car, but he also found the Pirelli tires difficult. If you're up against one of the best drivers in the world as your teammate, you don't need problems like that. Sure enough he was regularly over half a second off Vettel's pace, and that -- in F1 terms -- is an age. Webber signs one-year Red Bull extension . This year the exhaust-blown diffusers have been banished from the sport, as have Webber's troubles. Yes, the Pirelli tires continue to confound the drivers because of their complexity, but what the 35-year-old does have is that ""feel"" back from the steering wheel. It may sound like a weak excuse, but in order to gain that last percent of performance in F1, drivers need to balance the car on a knife-edge. If you aren't aggressive enough you'll tumble down the time sheets; if you fall the other side of the blade, you'll rumble into the barriers. Part of that balance is being able to feel every minute detail of what the car is. Unlike 2011, this year is not all about the speed of the Red Bull, though. The German Grand Prix will not just be a two-horse race between Webber and Vettel. Webber wins Monaco Grand Prix . Ferrari has managed to transform its car into a competitive machine after a slow start to the season, and McLaren should improve following a ""crisis meeting"" after the British Grand Prix. Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button finished down in eighth and 10th at Silverstone, soundly beaten by both the Lotus cars, which is not where they expected to be. There's a limit to what a team can do in two short weeks in order to turn their fortunes around, but McLaren is the best in the business when it comes to in-season development. When the lights go out at the start of the race on Sunday, Webber will -- qualifying problems aside -- be feeling confident. And rightly so.","Mark Webber is coming out from behind the shadow of teammate Sebastian Vettel .

"(CNN) -- Seven women and five men have weighed the case of Jerry Sandusky, the former Penn State assistant football coach charged with child rape. The panel, many with Penn State ties, includes one retired professor and one current professor, two graduates, two employees and one current student. Here is a snapshot of the jurors, based on courtroom reporter pool notes. JUROR No. 1 . The middle-aged woman was the first potential juror interviewed. She works at Walmart and has two daughters. The juror said she had no fixed opinions on the case and has no Penn State bias. JUROR No. 2 . The 24-year-old man is going to school in the fall to study automotive technology. JUROR No. 3 . The middle-aged juror's husband is a physician in the same medical group in which John McQueary, the father of one of the key witnesses in the case, works. Former graduate student Mike McQueary testified that he alerted football coach Joe Paterno in 2002 that he'd seen what appeared to be Sandusky sexually assaulting a boy in a shower in Penn State's athletic facilities, an allegation that authorities didn't learn of until years later. Defense attorney Joseph Amendola asked to have the woman struck for cause because of that relationship, but Judge John Cleland rejected his request. ""We're in Centre County. We're in rural Pennsylvania,"" he said. ""There are these (connections) that cannot be avoided."" It appeared that Amendola was going to use his first peremptory challenge, but Sandusky stopped him, saying, ""I think she would be fair."" JUROR No. 4 . An engineer from State College, the juror told attorneys he reached a saturation point and stopped reading about the case more than two months ago. The middle-aged man's wife works at a local library. ""I believe I can be open-minded,"" he said during questioning. JUROR No. 5 . A high school physics and chemistry teacher in his late 20s or early 30s, the juror has three children, including boys ages 5 and 2. He said he usually reads sports coverage and has just basic knowledge of the case. The Penn State grad has two degrees. JUROR No. 6 . Sandusky spoke at the graduation of the Penn State grad, 30. She majored in human development. She was previously known as Alternate No. 1, until she replaced the original Juror No. 6, who called in sick on June 20, the day the defense rested. JUROR No. 7 . The rising Penn State senior wore a school shirt to jury questioning and said he had strong feelings about football coach Joe Paterno's dismissal. He works part time for the athletics department, knows some of the witnesses and has ties to the football team. His mother works for the State College school district. The juror said he could set his opinions aside. ""Being a student, I hear everything. The whole outrage. Nothing specific."" Asked if he had thoughts about the scandal, the juror said, ""It's a lot of people's faults. Joe did a few things he shouldn't have."" JUROR No. 8 . The former Penn State soil science professor, in his late 60s or early 70s, worked at the university for 37 years before his retirement four years ago. The married former educator has followed the case and said he could put aside his connection to Penn State. JUROR No. 9 . The woman, in her 70s, was a school bus driver for 17 years before retirement. She said it was her duty to protect children, but she could consider the testimony of all sides. JUROR No. 10 . The Penn State employee is an administrative assistant in engineering. She has two daughters and four grandchildren. The middle-aged woman does not know anyone involved in the Sandusky case. JUROR No. 11 . The married 30-year-old woman has worked part-time at Penn State, and her husband currently works there as a media specialist. She has a 6-year-old son. She has had conversations with her husband about the case. She worked in dance classes at Penn State for about a year in the early 2000s, and she worked there recently. She knows one potential witness and said she has not read recently about the case. JUROR No. 12 . The woman, in her 50s or early 60s, has been a Penn State professor for 24 years. She has read the grand jury report detailing allegations against Sandusky and knows a potential witness. She interacted with former university President Graham Spanier while she worked on a small committee at Penn State for three years. The alternate jurors included: . ALTERNATE No. 2 . The married, middle-aged woman said she had little knowledge of the case and can be impartial. She has no children. ""I'm really bad about reading the newspaper. I don't watch a lot of television."" ALTERNATE No. 3 . The Penn State alum, in his 50s, has two sons, who are 29 and 30, and said he was familiar with Sandusky before the allegations. The juror walked in and smiled at Sandusky. He read the grand jury report but said he hasn't kept up with recent details. The football fan's wife works with a Penn State program geared toward getting high school students prepared for college. His brother-in-law is a retired corrections officer. The alternate said he could be objective. ALTERNATE No. 4 . The married woman, in her 60s, elicited laughter from defense lawyers and prosecutors when she said she doesn't believe half of what appears in her newspaper. She said she staunchly believes a defendant is innocent until proved guilty. ""It has to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt."" The alternate has no connections with the university and left State College when she was 19 and didn't return for 42 years. CNN's Dana Garrett, Laura Dolan and Lena Jakobsson, and Mayra Cuevas of TruTV's InSession, contributed to this report.","The 12 jurors include two Penn State grads and a current student .

"(CNN) -- Police say a Connecticut group home employee has been arrested after a video surfaced that shows her abusing a patient, dragging the woman by her hair and whipping her with a belt. Angelica Rivera, 34, admitted she was the attacker in the video and turned herself in to East Hartford police Thursday, authorities said Friday. She faces felony charges of unlawful restraint, cruelty and bias intimidation, and is expected to appear in court in Manchester, Connecticut, on August 1. Rivera, who has since been released on $25,000 bond, is also charged with assault, abuse and disorderly conduct, all misdemeanors. It is not clear who shot the video, and Rivera could not be immediately reached for comment. On Tuesday, East Hartford police say, they received a suspicious act complaint from Options Unlimited Inc., the privately held nonprofit that operates the home, about a video it received. The DVD was titled ""The Perfect Employee"" and sent to the operator of the home, authorities and a local television station, which prompted an investigation, police said Friday. On Wednesday, detectives found and questioned Rivera, who then admitted to the abuse, they added. A day later, police say, they obtained an arrest warrant, which prompted the woman to turn herself in. Options Unlimited responded earlier to the scandal, saying: ""We are deeply saddened and appalled by this incident. As soon as we became aware of it, we took prompt action and placed the employee on unpaid administrative leave."" Terrence W. Macy, commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Developmental Services, said he was also outraged by the video. ""Why would one human being do this to any other human being?"" he asked. ""This is a person who requires a lot of support, bathing and assistance eating,"" he told CNN affiliate WFSB. WFSB's reporting went on to say that state officials have examined other residents in the East Hartford group home but ""found no bruises or other signs of recent abuse.""

"London (CNN) -- The Duchess of Cambridge turns 30 today, but there is no big party planned for the milestone -- instead she is said to be planning a ""low-key"" birthday. On Sunday, the Duke and Duchess attended the star-studded UK premiere of Stephen Spielberg's ""War Horse."" Despite the rain, Kate wowed the crowds in London's Leicester Square in a black lace Alice Temperley gown -- accessorized with an umbrella, courtesy of her husband. But Monday's festivities look set to be much quieter -- a St James's Palace spokesperson told CNN it would be an ordinary day for the Duke and Duchess, with any celebrations likely to be ""private and low-key"". Her 30th birthday comes in the wake of a landmark year for Kate: The past 12 months have seen her take on her first royal engagements and marry into the monarchy in a ceremony watched by millions of people around the world. Just weeks after the wedding, Kate and Prince William were greeted like rock stars when they took part in their first overseas tour together, visiting Canada and the United States. This year there are likely to be similar levels of excitement when the couple travels to Malaysia, Singapore, the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu, as part of the celebrations for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.

"(CNN) -- A series of 30-year-old television interviews doesn't sound like promising movie material. Frank Langella gives ""a heavyweight performance"" as Richard Nixon, says Tom Charity. What's more, those who have watched all 20-plus hours of the David Frost-Richard Nixon conversations, which form the center of ""Frost/Nixon,"" recently report that they're overwhelmingly dry and dull, with the ex-president ably stonewalling questions that were not to his liking and indulging in elaborate self-justification on those that were. Of course, that's not what we remember. On the last day of 12 interview sessions, as had been agreed, British journalist Frost finally broached Watergate. This was always going to be the make-or-break moment. And to everyone's astonishment, it was Nixon who broke. Those fascinatingly unexpurgated five minutes of presidential floundering in the spring of 1977 weighed more than all the hours of explication that preceded them. At last, Tricky Dick admitted misdeeds -- not illegality as such, because, he claimed, the president cannot break the law. That exchange made Frost's reputation and sealed Nixon's public ignominy. (Some would argue that today such a sentiment is official government policy.) Can you build a movie on five revelatory minutes? If you're Peter Morgan, the answer is yes. The British playwright and screenwriter has a thing about mismatched power couples: the relationships between Tony Blair and Elizabeth II in ""The Queen""; a young Scottish medic and Ugandan President Idi Amin in ""The Last King of Scotland""; and between Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII in ""The Other Boleyn Girl,"" to name just his most recent credits. Morgan seems both awed and appalled by these power-mongers, locked in the solitary confinement that political leadership entails -- though his instinct is always to bring them down to earth, to find some common ground, however fleeting it may be. Interviews often are described as a courtship or seduction, but this one was more of a cross-examination. ""A duel,"" Nixon calls it. In a sense it's the trial he never faced. The entire country would be his jury. Much of the movie is designed to show us how the self-appointed prosecutor was ill-equipped for the task at hand: a playboy British comedian-turned-TV chat show host Down Under, more accustomed to trading quips with the Bee Gees than grilling presidents. Frost was a lightweight -- that's one of the reasons Nixon and his people agreed to the interview. (There were $600,000 more -- a landmark in checkbook journalism that director Ron Howard doesn't lose much sleep over.) Neither actor goes for a full-on impersonation. Michael Sheen -- Tony Blair in ""The Queen"" -- actually dials down Frost's distinctive nasal drone, but suggests how this congenial suck-up coasted on his blow-dried charm, rakish sideburns and unrealistic self-confidence. Frost may be out of his depth, but he's not about to let it cramp his style; he's delighted when the ex-president admires his slip-on Italian shoes. As Nixon, Frank Langella (like Sheen a holdover from the award-winning Broadway production) is suitably hunched and guttural, but more patrician and less jowly, than the real McCoy. Even so, it's a heavyweight performance. This Nixon is full of pride and fury, cerebral and rigorous but fatally hungry for exoneration, or, failing that (though he never quite admits it), forgiveness. Brash and brazen in comparison with ""The Queen,"" Morgan's script doesn't stop explaining itself and talking itself up, though what it all boils down to is rather less than meets the eye. At one point, a drunken wake-up call from Nixon finally kicks Frost into doing some hard journalism, but this a figment of the screenwriter's overly tidy creative imagination. iReport.com: Share reviews of 'Frost/Nixon' But Morgan is rock solid when it comes to structure. It's a compelling account, shrewdly bolstered with lively actors in both corners of the ring: Sam Rockwell, Matthew Macfadyen, Rebecca Hall and Oliver Platt in Frost's camp; Toby Jones and Kevin Bacon attending to the president. Jones steals his every scene as the bald germophobe and legendary agent Swifty Lazar, a neat counterpoint to his turn as Karl Rove in ""W."" ""Frost/Nixon"" doesn't have much to say about the disgraced president that Oliver Stone, for one, hasn't already explored in more depth, but by the last taping, in its glib and reductionist way, it works like a charm.

"(CNN) -- Standing a head taller than the worthy, conventional and mostly rather dull entries in this season's lackluster Oscar race, David Fincher's ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is a risky romantic epic, grand in ambition and design, alternately flawed and fabulous in execution. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett star in ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."" Sophisticated but oddball, ""Button"" will be a challenge for the marketing men, but audiences who take the plunge will likely find themselves entranced -- if occasionally enervated. F Scott Fitzgerald's slim novella presents enormous difficulties to the filmmaker. It is the story of a man born into a wizened and infirm body who gets younger as he ages. At 10, he has the physique of a diminutive septuagenarian. At 20, he looks like a 60-year-old. And so on, all the way to infancy and death. Between them, Fincher, star Brad Pitt, all the actors who play Benjamin at various ages, and some triumphant makeup and digital effects teams stitch together a character who is completely believable from first to last -- or last to first, if you prefer. Pitt, in particular, has never been better, and surely merits an Academy Award nomination even if his list of thanks would presumably entail extra minutes at the podium.  Watch a preview of ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" Â» . Benjamin's adoptive mother, a practical-minded African-American woman named Queenie (Taraji P. Henson), accepts the boy's unusual condition with the forbearance of someone accustomed to life's vicissitudes. In a clever invention from screenwriter Eric Roth (""The Good Shepherd"" and ""Forrest Gump""), Queenie runs a caring home for the elderly, so Master Benjamin fits in reasonably well, though one old lady is disconcerted by his fondness for her granddaughter Daisy. Fitzgerald's story is a pregnant philosophical conceit, like a peculiarly refined ""Twilight Zone"" episode, set among Baltimore's 19th-century gentry. Roth expands it into a rich Louisiana picaresque, ranging far and wide as Benjamin tastes romance in Russia with the wife of an English diplomat (a beguiling Tilda Swinton), comes off second-best in an encounter with a German U-boat, and pursues Daisy, the love of his life, first to New York and then to Paris. If Daisy (Cate Blanchett) is a nod in the direction of another beloved Fitzgerald character, Button is more akin to a slightly savvier Gump than to Gatsby, constantly buffeted by time's arrow and his outrageous fortune. He has better luck than Gatsby when it comes to romance -- though that has its own twist. The movie bides its sweet time, not all of it well spent. A framing device with Daisy on her deathbed, Hurricane Katrina brewing in the background, is cumbersome and not always as clear as it might be. A vignette with Elias Koteas as a clockmaker who loses his son in World War I and manufactures a station clock to turn back time is beautifully told, but it's gilding the lily. Likewise, there's an infuriatingly computer-generated hummingbird that pops up twice, a self-consciously poetic touch that feels heavy-handed and false. Despite these flaws, and others, the film's bittersweet reverse angle on the aging process is inescapably moving. There is something beautiful about the trajectory which sees Benjamin and Daisy's lifelong love affair blooming briefly in middle age, at the point where the scales come into balance, though Fitzgerald's dry account of the relationship gradually falling apart is probably more honest. All the same, we're left with a terrible sense of loneliness and loss as time inevitably takes its toll. David Fincher is famous for dark thrillers like ""Seven,"" ""Zodiac"" and ""Fight Club,"" but this bizarre and graceful love story is as morbid in its own way. Everybody dies. Even that ornately decorated New Orleans architecture is doomed to crumble. But, even if ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" ultimately falls frustratingly shy of enduring greatness, Fincher does a beautiful job. After all, it takes an artist to make time stand still.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's family and about 200 of their closest friends gathered on a hill Thursday evening for their final farewell to the pop singer, who died 10 weeks ago. Thursday's service for singer Michael Jackson began 90 minutes past the announced start time. Jackson's burial may lay to rest some of the mystery and controversy that erupted with his sudden death on June 25. His large family was divided over where the superstar's final resting place should be, but matriarch Katherine Jackson settled on a crypt inside the well-guarded and ornate Great Mausoleum at Forest Lawn cemetery in Glendale, California. Thursday's service began 90 minutes past the announced start time, leaving dozens of celebrities -- including Elizabeth Taylor -- waiting in their seats for the 26 cars carrying the Jackson clan to arrive.  Gallery: Invitation for Jackson's service Â» . It began with Jackson's five brothers -- each wearing a single sequined glove -- carrying his flower-covered bronze casket onto the outdoor stage among six large bouquets of white lilies and white roses, along with green topiaries. His three children, led by daughter, Paris, 11, placed a crown atop their father's coffin, which a family spokesman said it was ""to signify the final resting place of the King of Pop."" Jackson's children, parents and siblings took their seats in the front row, while his nieces and nephews filled several rows of white chairs behind them. After an opening prayer by Pastor Lucius Smith, soul music legend Gladys Knight sang the gospel hymn ""His Eye Is on the Sparrow."" Clifton Davis sang ""Never Can Say Goodbye,"" a hit he wrote for The Jackson 5 -- the group that featured a young Michael and his brothers. What was said by Jackson's father, Joe Jackson, and others who took the lectern is not publicly known, because the family barred news cameras from the ceremony. A family statement issued afterward said close friends and family, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, spoke ""spontaneously to celebrate Michael's life."" News helicopters hovering above captured video from a distance, but without sound.  Watch media cover Jackson funeral Â» . Lisa Marie Presley, one of Jackson's former wives and the daughter of Elvis, attended the service, according to the family statement. It did not mention Debbie Rowe, Jackson's second wife and the mother of his two oldest children. Macaulay Culkin, the ""Home Alone"" actor who spent time with Jackson during his Neverland Ranch days, was there with his girlfriend, actress Mila Kunis. Actors Corey Feldman and Chris Tucker were also seen arriving for the service. Motown founder Berry Gordy, who gave Jackson and his brothers their first big record deal, and Quincy Jones, who produced Jackson's ""Thriller"" album, were there. Music producer Teddy Riley, who helped with Jackson's 1991 ""Dangerous"" album, attended. The guest list included TV executive Suzanne de Passe, who produced a miniseries about Jackson's family, and Kenny Ortega,  who was producing Jackson's comeback show. Thomas Mesereau, the lawyer who successfully defended Jackson in a child molestation trial, sat just behind the Jackson family. When the hour-long service ended, his brothers lifted Jackson's casket for a final time to carry him inside the Great Mausoleum, where he was placed in his crypt at 9:43 p.m. PT (12:43 a.m. ET Friday). The family statement said it was ""his final resting place."" The family and friends then drove to an Italian restaurant eight miles away, in Pasadena, California, for ""a time of celebration."" The massive mausoleum, the final resting place for Clark Gable, Carole Lombard and dozens of other celebrities, is normally open to tourists, though the public is denied close access to crypts. Security guards, aided by cameras, keep constant vigil over the graves and crypts, which are surrounded by a world-class collection of art and architecture.

Jackson's burial was delayed by division among family members, though Katherine Jackson would make the final decision, brother Jermaine Jackson recently told CNN. He preferred to see his youngest brother laid to rest at his former Neverland Ranch home, north of Los Angeles in Santa Barbara County, California. That idea was complicated by neighbors who vowed to oppose allowing a grave in the rural area -- and by Jackson family members who said the singer would not want to return to the home where he faced child molestation charges, of which he was ultimately acquitted. The mystery of where Jackson would be buried became a media obsession in the weeks after his death. After his body was loaded onto a helicopter at UCLA's Ronald Reagan Medical Center hours after his June 25 death, it stayed in the custody of the Los Angeles County coroner for an autopsy. It was only later disclosed that Jackson's corpse was kept in a refrigerated room at the Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn cemetery until his casket was carried by motorcade to downtown Los Angeles for a public memorial service in the Staples Center arena. Again, speculation about Jackson's whereabouts grew when the media lost track of his casket after his brothers carried it out of sight inside the arena. It was only recently confirmed that it was taken back to the Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn while awaiting his family's decision. Though Thursday's interment may settle one Jackson mystery, a more serious one remains. The coroner announced last week that he had ruled Jackson's death a homicide. A summary of the coroner's report said the anesthetic propofol and the sedative lorazepam were the primary drugs responsible for the singer's death. Los Angeles police detectives have not concluded their criminal investigation and no one has been charged.","Jackson's three kids, led by daughter, Paris, placed a crown atop their father's coffin .

"(CNN) -- It was a sea rescue made for Hollywood: A horse in a photo shoot on a Southern California beach gets spooked and runs into the water, only to be rescued after swimming more than two miles offshore. That's what happened to a 7-year-old white Arabian named William, said Santa Barbara Harbor Patrol Officer Ryan Kelly. The drama unfolded Tuesday about 6:30 p.m. when the horse bolted from the beach in Summerland, just south of Santa Barbara, and ran into the ocean. ""The initial call came in as a missing horse,"" Kelly said. Several more calls followed about a horse swimming out to sea. Rescue personnel from the nearby Carpenteria Fire Department, along with state lifeguards, took to the water to search for the horse, and a helicopter was launched by Santa Barbara County's search and rescue team. William was spotted more than two miles offshore in the Santa Barbara Channel, swimming toward oil rigs, according to an incident report. ""Firefighters were able to hook the animal's reins with a boat hook and bring it alongside a paddleboat,"" the report said. Floats were put under its neck to help keep its head above water. Photos and video taken of the rescue show Kelly and others placing a tow line under the horse's saddle and securing it to the boat. Harbor patrol personnel and lifeguards appeared to take turns holding the horse's head up. ""It took about two-and-a-half hours to escort the horse back to dry land and into the hands of a vet,"" Kelly said. The horse was taken to an animal clinic in the area and released back to the owner. CNN's Irving Last contributed to this report.","A 7-year-old Arabian horse named William got spooked and ran into the water, rescuers say .

"(CNN) -- ""Slumdog Millionaire"" took home eight Oscars on Sunday night, a surprising achievement for a film once thought to be straight-to-DVD fodder. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" with Dev Patel and Freida Pinto has a ""rags-to-riches"" storyline with wide appeal. The colorful story, which mixes the gritty life of Mumbai's poor with the shiny aspirations of the new India, features no stars recognizable to Western audiences, but it may have made one of its native country. So, is it time for Bollywood -- as India's huge Mumbai-based film industry is called -- to come to America? ""International cinema comes in cycles in the United States,"" said Frank Lovece, a film critic with Film Journal International. ""Now, it's Bollywood's time."" But ""Slumdog"" is a far cry from the lavish movie musicals made by Bollywood, which releases nearly 1,000 films annually. And it's not authentically Indian -- it was directed by Briton Danny Boyle, and the leading actor, Dev Patel, was born and raised in England.  Watch the ""Slumdog"" principals talk about their victories Â» . However, the film is a celebration of India -- from the slums to the Taj Mahal. It pays homage to Bollywood by incorporating many of the industry's norms -- vibrant colors, fast-paced editing, a fairy-tale love story and a feel-good musical dance ending. "" 'Slumdog' is the reason why people go to the movies. It's the whole package,"" said Gene Newman, editorial director at Premiere.com. ""It's an incredible story ... and it makes you feel good.""  Memorable moments from the Oscars Â» . Priya Joshi, associate professor of English at Temple University and author of the forthcoming book, ""Crime and Punishment: Nationalism and Public Fantasy in Bollywood Cinema,"" said the film's ""rags-to-riches"" storyline has a lot to do with its wide mainstream appeal. ""Hindi film and Bollywood, in particular, is a profoundly political cinema about the crisis of the day,"" she said. ""Today, the typical American feels like the poor in the world. ... This sense of vulnerability is what the film is able to capture.""  Watch the ""Slumdog"" stars talk about bonds between the cultures Â» . Hollywood often has used international styles and filmmakers to its advantage. In its early days, the U.S. film capital embraced European directors such as Fritz Lang and Jean Renoir. The 1960s saw the influence of French New Wave cinema. Japanese films inspired ""The Magnificent Seven"" and ""Star Wars""; Hong Kong works inspired Hollywood blockbusters such as ""The Departed"" and ""The Matrix."" ""Slumdog"" isn't even the first film centering on India to attract Hollywood's attention. ""Indian cinema has been around in the United States since Satyajit Ray in the early 1940s,"" Lovece said. Ray, who won the Academy Award for lifetime achievement in 1992, made films in Bengali, a language spoken in eastern India. Despite that fact, his movies, notably ""The Apu Trilogy,"" have had universal appeal. Since Ray, many Indian actors have emerged on the Hollywood scene. Aishwarya Rai, one of Bollywood's leading ladies, starred in 2004's ""Bride and Prejudice"" and appeared, more recently, in ""The Pink Panther 2."" ""India's movie stars are essentially the country's ambassadors,"" said Gitesh Pandya, box-office analyst and founder of BoxOfficeGuru.com. ""A lot of people going to see [""Pink Panther 2""] are learning about Bollywood through [Aishwarya Rai]."" From Ray to Rai, Indian influence in American cinema is vast. Many Hollywood films also have been influenced by Bollywood. Baz Luhrman's 2001 musical ""Moulin Rouge,"" a tragic romance told with song and dance, borrows heavily from Bollywood. ""These big, epic numbers are very reminiscent of Bollywood,"" Newman said, also referring to ""Chicago,"" ""Mama Mia!"" and ""West Side Story."" ""Musicals have always been part of the tradition of American cinema, and Bollywood really just took it to the next level."" Hollywood films such as 2008's ""The Love Guru"" and 2005's ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" -- which ends with a musical dance number -- also borrow from Bollywood, Newman said, but are comedies that parody the enchantment in Bollywood films. ""There's innocence and playfulness in a lot of the cinema in India,"" he said, which is why Bollywood, in its authentic form, would not appeal to American audiences. ""We're a little more cynical,"" said Newman. "" 'West Side Story' is kind of laughable by today's standards. ... But, for some reason, in India, that innocence is still acceptable."" Joshi said the cultural differences between Bollywood and Hollywood could make it difficult for Bollywood films to cross over to America. ""India is still clinging on to its social values, which explains Bollywood's success everywhere but in America,"" she said. ""Bollywood films don't have any kissing in them or tend not to. Warner Bros. used to make movies like this in the past. ... If it's ready to ready to return to its roots, then it's ready for Bollywood."" American audiences may want to explore Bollywood films after seeing ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" Pandya said, but it is unlikely that they will find another film like it. ""The film is obviously very successful, but it is its own entity so it doesn't necessarily mean that people in this country will wake up to Bollywood overnight,"" he said. ""Bollywood is not for everybody. ... People who love to see Adam Sandler movies are not going to line up to see Bollywood films."" Newman agreed, saying that, for now, America will see Bollywood only in small traces. ""I think a lot of filmmakers have been enamored with Bollywood,"" he said. ""They're investing over there, like [Steven] Spielberg."" But in American cinema, ""for the most part, there will be little tinges of Bollywood.""","""Slumdog Millionaire"" is not authentically Bollywood or Indian .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Designer Stephen Shadley knows the entertainment industry. He grew up in Southern California, worked as a scenic artist and toured with Disney. He's also designed homes for stars such as Diane Keaton, Woody Allen and Jennifer Aniston. Stephen Shadley's Oscar green room was inspired by his renovation of a 1970s home. Now Shadley is in Tinseltown for a different kind of industry-related project: designing the Architectural Digest green room -- the backstage area where stars can relax while the show runs -- at the 81st Annual Academy Awards. ""I've sort of been captivated by the movies,"" Shadley said, warming up after landing in Los Angeles less than an hour before. ""It's something I've always enjoyed."" Shadley's design was inspired by his recent renovation of a 1970s home. ""It was time to go back to a period I actually remembered,"" he said. The design includes an 11-foot couch, an 1,100-pound bar, a drop-down ceiling and a magnificent shag rug. ""It's the 1970s. You've got to have the shag rug,"" said Adrienne Kauderer, the magazine's promotions director. Kauderer walked through the half-finished room Tuesday as production workers scurried around her. The magazine's crew had two days to finish building the entire space from scratch. And it's bigger this year, as Kauderer pointed out. An extension of the green room will allow access for presenters not walking down the red carpet.  Gallery: Take a tour of the green room Â» . There were several other requirements for Shadley's design. The room had to have certain seating, spacing, and include advertisers' products. But the focal point for the room is one of Shadley's personal touches. The panoramic view of Los Angeles from the Hollywood Hills comes from the very studio at 20th Century Fox where he had his first job. ""I'm hoping it will transport people a little, give them the illusion that they're actually in this [spacious] room, rather than a green room backstage,"" Shadley said. The designer kept the room's color palette monochromatic in order to provide a simple backdrop for its occupants' gowns. Although smaller than you would imagine a setting for the stars, its elegance -- even in the beginning stages -- speaks volumes. ""I want to try to make people feel rested and comfortable and glamorous because they're going out to do the most glamorous thing on earth -- presenting an Academy Award,"" Shadley said.","Stephen Shadley handled Oscar green room design .

"Below is an excerpt from CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta's new book,  ""Cheating Death: The Doctors and Medical Miracles that Are Saving Life Against All Odds"" published by Wellness Central, an imprint of Grand Central Publishing. The following is from Chapter Two: A Heart-Stopping Moment: . ""Cheating Death: The Doctors and Medical Miracles that Are Saving Lives Against All Odds,"" just hit store shelves. And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm. -- 2 Kings 4:34, KJV . Mike Mertz was driving home, an hour after finishing his run as a school bus driver in Glendale, Arizona. He told me he doesn't remember why he didn't come straight home from work that day. He thinks that maybe he went for a jog. A trim fifty-nine years old, Mertz enjoyed a two- or three-mile run several days a week. Maybe he was looking for a cheaper gas station than the one on his usual route or was just trying to avoid taking his Saturn over a nasty set of new speed bumps. Whatever the reason, whatever route he wandered, it brought Mertz not to the usual entrance of his townhome complex, but the back driveway. The change in routine may have saved his life. Corey Ash, a UPS driver, was making deliveries that Wednesday afternoon, when he heard a terrible engine noise. Thinking the sound was underneath his own hood, he pulled over. Hopping out, Ash immediately realized that it was coming from a Saturn almost directly across the street. It was an accident scene. The small silver car was piled up against a palm tree, the engine revving at top speed. The only thing keeping it in place was a stucco wall a few feet from the tree; the car was wedged between the two. Racing over, Ash could see that the driver had his eyes closed and seemed to be unconscious. The driver's foot was wedged against the accelerator. Ignoring the chance that the car might break free and crush him, Ash reached across the slumped body and turned off the ignition. He dragged Mertz out of the car and laid him on the ground. After dialing 911, Ash started CPR the way he'd learned during an Air National Guard training exercise just two months before. As he listened to the ambulance siren, racing up the road from Glendale Fire Station 154 barely a mile away, Ash began to pump hard on Mertz' chest. Studies show that when a bystander jumps in, the chances of survival in a cardiac arrest case increase exponentially. Even though it may not seem like you are accomplishing much, simply pushing the heart and circulating the blood can make a tremendous difference. Mertz had that going for him, but he was also fortunate to have collapsed in Glendale. Paramedics there are at the forefront of a revolution in emergency care. With a few simple measures -- going against the grain of the medical establishment -- they have found that they can radically improve the odds of surviving a cardiac arrest. The fire engine pulled up with a screech, and a brawny firefighter named Ruben Florez jumped to the curb. As fellow firefighters scrambled down, Florez thumped an urgent rhythm on Mertz' chest, two hundred compressions over two minutes, before a medic stepped in and delivered an electric shock from the paddles of a defibrillator. Win a signed copy of Dr. Gupta's book . Then came another two hundred compressions, then shock, two hundred compressions, then shock. Finally, after six hundred thumps and three defibrillator shocks, a weak pulse returned. Mertz was back from the dead. At no point was mouth-to-mouth resuscitation performed, and at no point did Mike Mertz get a breath. Surprisingly, that may be the real reason he survived. In reality, survival from cardiac arrest outside the hospital is rare. Until very recently, Arizona was in line with the rest of the country -- only about 2 percent of the victims pulled through without long-term damage. But in 2005, cities around Arizona began doing something new. It went against the guidelines of the American Medical Association and the teaching practices of major medical schools and hospitals. This new method didn't look like the CPR that had been taught in every YMCA, firehouse, school, and church ever since the 1970s. In short, it was a radical experiment. The experiment sprang from two lines of thinking: animal studies aimed at modifying CPR technique and a public health effort to train more people in CPR. If your heart gives out while you're walking down the street, the number-one thing that can save your life is to have a bystander who is not only trained in CPR , but willing to help. Unfortunately, such help is rare. Published studies put the rate of bystander CPR at around 20 percent. If you dig deep, the number really has nothing to do with the lack of desire. Instead, study after study shows people are apprehensive about putting their mouth on someone else's and maybe catching an infection from someone who's on the ground dying. Now, the reluctance can be overcome. In Seattle, which has run massive training programs and public education campaigns since the 1970s, the rate of CPR assistance from bystanders is close to 50 percent. That one fact gets much of the credit for the city's high survival rate from cardiac arrest. In recent years, a driving goal of the American Heart Association has been to encourage more members of the public to jump in and help. But how? There was simply no getting around mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Or was there?

"Editor's note: A nationally syndicated columnist, Roland S. Martin is the author of ""Listening to the Spirit Within: 50 Perspectives on Faith"" and ""Speak, Brother! A Black Man's View of America."" Visit his Web site for more information. Roland S. Martin says America's history with Iran has not been a happy one. (CNN) -- Critics of President Obama, mostly Republicans, have seethed that he has not been more forceful in ripping the theocratic leadership in Iran for their brutal handling of protesters angry with what they see as a stolen election. In Tuesday's press conference, the president toughened his talk, saying, ""The United States and the international community have been appalled and outraged by the threats, beatings and imprisonments of the last few days."" Still, Obama's measured and calm approach has been right on target, while his critics have been totally off base. What these shortsighted naysayers should do is pick up a history book, or take a quick trip to Langley, Virginia, and let the CIA tell them our own sordid past with Iran. Whenever U.S. relations with Iran are raised, everyone seems to want to refer back to 1979, when our embassy was overrun by militants and Americans were taken hostage for 444 days. The nation, and the world, was captivated by the drama, and many consider the affair the chief reason why President Carter lost to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election. The Iranian revolution of that era is what led to today's theocratic rule in Iran, where the clerics hold sway over every facet of the country. They replaced the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, himself a dictator who ruled with an iron fist with the help of his CIA-trained death squads. How did he come to power? The United States helped overthrow a democratically elected government in Iran. To understand the hatred of the United States in Iran, we have to go further back than 1979 -- to 1953, when Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh had the gall to care more about his country than what the British and the United States wanted. The two superpowers were angry that he nationalized oil interests -- at the time Anglo-Iranian Oil, now known as British Petroleum, was receiving 93 percent of oil proceeds and the Iranians were getting 7 percent. So with the CIA leading the charge, along with British intelligence, the United States helped destabilize the country, blocked the importing of goods, spread leaflets around the country blasting Mossadegh for a lack of leadership, and used local goons to lead protests. It was this effort that led to the installation of the Shah of Iran, who subsequently had Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini exiled. Khomeini was a revolutionary leader who used his voice to label the United States the ""Great Satan"" for its actions. Nice history lesson, you might say, but what does it have to do with today? Everything. Khomeini rose to power by blasting the United States for intervening in the affairs of Iran. It was the younger voices in Iran who responded to his criticism of the United States, and they cast their lot with a revolutionary figure rather than the pro-Western Shah of Iran. One of those young men who cared more about their own country than the interests of the United States? Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, now the president of Iran (A fascinating account of our sordid history with Iran is detailed in Stephen Kinzer's ""Overthrow: America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq""). President Obama knows that every word uttered by U.S. leaders can be turned right around and used against the protesters who are in the streets. He also understands how deep resentment of the United States is in Iran, and if the clerics can successfully get people to believe that the United States is behind the protests, they have the possibility of using America as the scapegoat. Isn't it ironic that the president's conservative critics want him to stand up for democracy in Iran, when it was the United States that chose to destroy democracy and install a dictator we could control more than 50 years ago? Folks, democracy can never be imported. It must be homegrown. If we look at our own Civil Rights Movement, the democratic movement in Poland and all of Eastern Europe, they were all driven by the people at the bottom, not the top. We are seeing a remarkable amount of courage in Iran. The people there are tired of being treated like children, and are putting their lives on the line to demand change in the country. Instead of inflaming tensions, the United States should continue to issue tempered comments, and allow the people in the streets to drive this issue. This should not become a U.S. vs. Iran discussion. If the focus remains on those demanding change in the streets of Iran, especially if the beatings and oppression continues -- remember Selma, Alabama, and Bloody Sunday? -- then those who are silent in Iran will be silent no more, and other countries will begin to weigh in on the brutality. The change we desire in Iran will not happen with a press release or a comment by the president of the United States or even a congressional resolution. We must show support, but from a distance. The United States played a direct role in the mess we see in Iran today. It's best that we shut up and allow Iran to determine Iran's fate. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S. Martin.","Roland Martin: Obama's critics wrongly accuse him of being too cautious on Iran .

"Editor's note: This story is based on interrogation reports that form part of the prosecution case in the forthcoming trial of six Belgian citizens charged with participation in a terrorist group. Versions of those documents were obtained by CNN from the defense attorney of one of those suspects. The statement by Bryant Vinas was compiled from an interview he gave Belgian prosecutors in March 2009 in New York, and was confirmed by U.S. prosecutors as authentic. The statement by Walid Othmani was given to French investigators, and was authenticated by Belgian prosecutors. A U.S. military Humvee patrols the volatile Afghan-Pakistan border area earlier this year. (CNN) -- When Bryant Neal Vinas spoke at length with Belgian prosecutors last March, he provided a fascinating and sometimes frightening insight into al Qaeda's training -- and its agenda. Vinas is a young American who was arrested in Pakistan late in 2008 after allegedly training with al Qaeda in the Afghan-Pakistan border area. He was repatriated to the United States and in January pled guilty to charges of conspiracy to murder U.S. nationals, providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization, and receiving military-type training from a foreign terrorist organization. In notes made by FBI agents of interviews with Vinas, he admits he went to Pakistan to join al Qaeda and kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan. But the terror group appeared to have other ideas for him. He volunteered to become a suicide bomber but was dissuaded at every turn. Read how al Qaeda is now operating . On Thanksgiving weekend last year, shortly after his arrest, much of the New York mass transit system including Penn Station was put on high alert. According to the Belgian prosecutor's document, Vinas had told al Qaeda's command everything he knew about the system. In his interview with Belgian prosecutors Vinas stated that he met with several members of a Belgian-French group while training in the tribal areas of Pakistan. One member of this group, a 25-year-old Frenchman called Walid Othmani, provided French interrogators with an account of his time in Pakistan after being arrested on his return to Europe. Belgian prosecutors told CNN Othmani has been charged in France with participation in a criminal conspiracy with the aim of preparing a terrorist act. A Belgian legal document detailing his interrogation report was obtained by CNN. Read how the Europeans trained with al Qaeda . Vinas's and Othmani's account of their time in al Qaeda training camps in Pakistan is a playbook of how the terror group survived after 9/11 and continues to operate in the remote hills of Pakistan. The documents provide an inside view of al Qaeda's organizational structures, training programs, and the protective measures the terrorist organization has taken against increasingly effective U.S. missile strikes. Arguably, they shed more light on the state of al Qaeda than any previously released into the public domain. The accounts suggest al Qaeda has shown remarkable adaptability and remains as committed as ever to launching attacks in the West, with mass transit a top target. They also revealed al Qaeda training programs for new forms of attack, including breaking into residences to carry out targeted assassinations. Read how al Qaeda is adapting . While intelligence officials say intensified U.S. strikes using Predator drones have degraded al Qaeda's capabilities since the end of last year, the accounts suggest that al Qaeda has been able to sustain many of its training operations by confining them to small dwellings in the remote mountains of Waziristan. Although not able to operate training camps on anything like the scale they did in Afghanistan during the 1990s the wide number of training courses still available to recruits suggests al Qaeda still poses a significant threat. Inside these dwellings bomb-making training appears to have been emphasized, some of it very sophisticated. While al Qaeda's potential pool of recruits may have shrunk significantly because of a backlash against the terrorist organization in Muslim communities around the world -- due to its targeting of civilians and the fact that so many of its victims have been Muslim -- the insider accounts suggest there is still a significant number of hardcore extremists in the West and in Muslim countries who are willing to join Osama bin Laden's terrorist outfit. What stands out especially from the accounts is the high degree of initiative and perseverance that the Western recruits had to show to join up with jihadist groups in the mountains on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. But Vinas and Othmani's accounts also suggest that al Qaeda may be having leadership problems. While able to find fresh recruits to replace those killed and arrested it seems to have more difficulty replacing senior military trainers and other key operational figures. A former U.S. government official, specializing in counter-terrorism, commented that the insider accounts suggest the same people are leading training as a decade ago. The only difference, there are fewer of them. Perhaps those killed or captured are not being replaced. Recent reports that al Qaeda is moving some operatives out of the tribal areas of Pakistan towards safer placements in Pakistani cities, or to jihadist fronts in other countries such as Yemen and Somalia, may indicate that the pressure from U.S. missile strikes is starting to show. But the decentralization of al Qaeda's training and their ever closer ties with local Pakistani Taliban, mean it remains extremely difficult to eliminate from the mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Above all the accounts from Vinas and others show that al Qaeda's training structures have but one goal, another 9/11.

"Dr. Sanjay Gupta, a neurosurgeon, is author of the new book ""Cheating Death,"" which will be published next month. This article originally appeared in the September 20, 2009, issue of Parade and Parade.com. (Parade) -- I am going to let you in on a secret: When a person's heart stops beating, it's not the end. Contrary to what you may think, death is not a single event. Instead, it's a process that can be interrupted. Sanjay Gupta says the latest CPR techniques can save the lives of vicitims of cardiac arrest. Mike Mertz knows this firsthand. On January 23, 2008, the 59-year-old Arizona man was driving home from work. The last thing he remembers is pulling into his complex's driveway. Then his heart stopped. Corey Ash, a passing UPS driver, noticed a silver Saturn wedged between a palm tree and a wall, with the engine running and a person slumped at the wheel. Ash stopped to investigate. He switched off the car's engine, pulled Mertz out, and laid him on the ground. Ash called 911 and started pumping the older man's chest. The next few minutes would be absolutely critical for Mertz. If you had been there, standing over Mertz's lifeless body, would you have known what to do? A person's life can slip away in a few minutes. Without a heartbeat, circulation slows to a halt. Blood no longer flows to the organs, and the brain is the first one to suffer. In normal times, the brain, which constitutes 2 percent of our body mass, consumes about 20 percent of the oxygen the body takes in. After 10 seconds without oxygen, the brain's functions slow. Without oxygen or signals from the brain, other organs begin to break down. Diaphragm muscles no longer contract and release to bring in air. The kidneys stop filtering blood. At the same time, an elaborate chain reaction triggers a breakdown in cells throughout the body. Parade.com: 4 diseases you can fight with exercise . Scientists and physicians are now learning that this process can be reversed. When it comes to cardiac arrest, however, the chances of surviving an episode outside a hospital are poor. Only 2 percent of victims pull through without long-term damage. The No. 1 thing that has been shown to make a difference is the action of a bystander. If a passerby jumps in and gives CPR, as Corey Ash did, the likelihood of survival rises significantly. But if onlookers do nothing, those chances drop -- fast. According to the American Heart Association, for every minute that goes by without someone attempting CPR, the survival rate decreases 7 to 10 percent. Studies have found that bystanders perform CPR in only 20 to 30 percent of cases. Researchers say it's not because people don't want to help -- it's because they're apprehensive about putting their mouths on someone else's, especially if the person is dying. But what I'm about to tell you may change your mind about what you can do in a situation like Mertz's. More than 15 years ago, cardiologist Gordon Ewy and researchers at the University of Arizona's Sarver Heart Center were puzzling over how to get more people to give CPR. To simplify the method, they wondered what would happen if they advocated performing compressions without mouth-to-mouth respiration. After running successful laboratory trials, Ewy spoke to emergency-services directors in Arizona, Wisconsin, and Missouri. They were intrigued by his findings and agreed to promote the use of compression-only CPR among people in their states. They also implemented a protocol for their paramedics and firefighters that emphasized giving chest compressions with minimal interruptions to keep the patient's blood circulating. Parade.com: 8 ways to stay healthy . The results were remarkable: Not only were survival rates for people who got only compressions just as good as those for people who got traditional CPR, they actually were better. Why was it so effective? Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation supplies oxygen, which we need continuously. As it turns out, our bloodstreams contain plenty of oxygen at any moment. Even if we stop breathing, our oxygen levels remain normal for quite a while. If we do stop breathing, however, the sole way to make the oxygen circulate is by having someone pump our chests. In 2007, Japanese researchers revealed the results of a massive study on bystander intervention. They looked at cases where a person (not in a hospital) suffered cardiac arrest in view of a bystander -- and with his or her heart in a rhythm that would respond to a defibrillator. The survival rate was 11 percent for those who got standard CPR -- mouth-to-mouth plus chest compressions -- before an ambulance arrived. The rate was 19 percent for those who got only compressions. The act of keeping oxygen circulating could increase a victim's chances of surviving by as much as 70 percent. This is not a fancy technology born in a gleaming lab, yet it is one of the most significant recent breakthroughs in medicine. Because heart disease is the biggest killer in the United States, this simple act could save thousands of people's lives every year. Like Mike Mertz's. Shortly after Corey Ash began CPR, paramedics trained in the compression-only technique arrived. Thanks to them and to an alert bystander, Mertz survived. One day, the bystander could be you. Parade.com: 7 habits for a longer life . Remember: As soon as you see someone suffer what you think may be cardiac arrest, call 911, start giving chest compressions 100 times a minute, and don't stop for anything. To get more information and to find classes in your area in emergency cardiovascular care, go to the American Heart Association Web site. Advances in saving hearts . â¢ Stem cells: Back when I was in medical school, I learned that any damage to the heart from a heart attack was permanent. This past summer, Mayo Clinic researchers working on mice converted adult scar cells into stem cells, which they injected into damaged hearts. The cells restored heart-muscle performance, stopped the progression of damage, and regenerated injured tissue. Scientists at Mayo tell me this will soon be tested on humans. â¢ Drug-releasing stents: People at risk for heart disease who have a blockage in the vessels supplying blood to their hearts may undergo an angioplasty to open the vessel. Afterward, doctors often insert a stent (a mesh tube) to continue holding the artery open. The newest stents serve a dual role: They also release medication that prevents scar tissue from developing. â¢ CRP testing: You should have your cholesterol levels checked regularly. But you might also ask your doctor about getting your C-reactive protein, or CRP, checked. It is a marker for inflammation, a powerful risk factor for heart disease. Changes in diet and exercise can usually reduce high CRP levels.","Gupta: Death is not a single event; it's a process that can be interrupted .

"(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia's health minister was the first person in the country to receive the H1N1 vaccination Saturday in a televised event aimed at calming fears about the safety of the vaccine. After Abdullah Al-Rabeeah got the vaccine, his daughter and several other government officials received it, a spokesman for the Saudi Health Ministry said. The vaccinations became a thorny issue in Saudi Arabia and some neighboring countries after the government strongly recommended the vaccine to people coming to the country for the Hajj, a pilgrimage required of Muslims at least once in their lives. Health officials have been concerned about how to keep the virus, also known as swine flu, from spreading among the millions of visitors expected in Saudi Arabia during this year's Hajj. But some have expressed fears about the vaccination. ""I'm being forced to get this shot,"" said Saher Abu Al-Khair, an Egyptian who is planning a pilgrimage. ""And if God wills that I should die as a result, so be it."" Saudi's Health Ministry said it hoped televising the health minister rolling up his sleeve for the shot will help calm fears. ""I have taken the adjuvant vaccine to tell them that even adjuvant vaccine is safe and I gave it to my daughter in public because we've been studying this for the last few months,"" the health minister said. ""We're confident that it is similar to seasonal flu vaccine and we feel that it is safe."" CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom and Ben Wedeman contributed to this report.","Health officials concerned about spread of swine flu from millions visiting country for this year's Hajj .

"(Budget Travel) -- In recent years, this fishing town -- and next-wave surf spot -- has turned into a popular rest stop for Inca Trail hikers. Oceanfront lodging runs about $40 a night in Mancora, Peru. Bus ride: $37 . The quickest way to reach MÃ¡ncora, about 700 miles north of Lima, is to hop on one of Lan Peru's twice daily flights from Lima to Piura ($225 round trip); from there, it's about a two-hour cab ride to MÃ¡ncora ($70). If you have 18 hours to spare, take the Cruz del Sur bus (cruzdelsur.com.pe, $37). Tear your eyes from the dubbed American movies shown along the way and you may spot a dolphin or two frolicking in the Pacific Ocean. Beach hotel: $40 . There are two types of lodging: on the beach -- like Punta Ballenas Inn ( 011-51/7325-8136) -- and almost on the beach. In the case of Hospedaje Costa Norte, you're a minute's walk from the surf. The rooms surround a courtyard guarded by Pedro, a parrot with a penchant for giving besitos (little kisses) to female guests (011-51/7325-8198, from $10). Yoga hotel: $70 . Samana Chakra is a new thatched-roof bungalow resort on the northern end of the beach, owned by an ex-marketing director from California and his wife, a Peruvian yoga instructor. The rate includes breakfast and a daily hatha yoga class (totally optional, of course). Early risers can even surf with the owners, who ride tandem on a longboard (011-51/1-9830-5896, samanachakra.com). Taxi fare: 95Â¢ . Moto-taxis, three-wheeled motorbikes with a covered backseat for two, are MÃ¡ncora's primary form of transportation. The bumpy ride across town costs about a dollar. For $14 round trip, a moto cabbie will take you into the Amotape Mountains to the thermal hot springs at Poza de Barro. Surf school: $16 . MÃ¡ncora's six-foot waves rival those of better-known surf spots in Peru, such as Chicama, but early mornings often bring waves that are ideal for beginners. Several shorefront surf schools offer 90-minute private lessons. Tasty lunch: $6 . Fried yucca and ice-cold Brahma beer are the perfect companions to ceviche, the national dish of Peru, made with seafood, maize, crescents of sweet potato, and a citrus marinade. At CevicherÃ­a Las PeÃ±itas, an entire meal, including ceviche and beer, costs less than $6. Fruit drink: 50Â¢ . The best deal in town is a cremolada (a crushed-ice beverage made with passion fruit, strawberry, orange, or pineapple) at Papa Mo's Milk Bar. Passion fruit is said to have a mildly sedative effect -- not unlike a few days spent in MÃ¡ncora. Necklace: $7 . On a three-block stretch of sidewalk near the southern end of town, dreadlocked nomads and local artisans sell everything from shark jaws to tins of natilla, Peru's version of dulce de leche. The most unusual wares are adorned with deep orange huayruro seeds, which come from the Amazon rain forest and are believed to ward off negative energy. A double-strand necklace costs $7.

"(CNN) -- You're delayed at the airport. It's going to be hours before the airline can get you on another flight. You log onto your computer and answer your e-mails. You surf the Web for a while. You're still waiting. This is taking way too long. JetBlueCheeps on Twitter alerts followers of last-minute deals on JetBlue. Might as well tweet about it. And if you do, the chances are ever increasing that someone at the airline will see what you have written. They may even respond to it. Airlines are ramping up their use of social networking sites. Several have one employee in the communications department whose primary job is to monitor what is being said about them and to create a presence in the world of Twitter and Facebook. Other staff members also watch the sites in search of opportunities to improve relationships with customers. ""Promotions clearly work well, but there is also an opportunity for airlines to improve customer service and brand perception,"" Adam Ostrow, editor-in-chief of social media guide Mashable.com and a commentator on social networking sites, wrote in an e-mail interview. ""If you're stuck at an airport, and it's the airline's fault, you're going to tweet about it. If the airline responds to those tweets in a positive fashion, it at least shows they care, even if they can't immediately remedy the issue."" JetBlue has embraced Twitter as both a medium to update the public on its latest news and a sounding board for how the airline is doing. The airline has more than 1 million followers on Twitter and it also follows about 120,000 of those tweeters. ""The tricky thing with following people is that you don't want to creep anyone out,"" said Alex Headrick, senior analyst of corporate communications at JetBlue. ""You don't want to look like you are stalking them just because they are talking about us."" The trick is to watch them and see if the tweeter is trying to actively engage the airline in conversation, he said. Often when that happens, someone from the company will send a private message to that person. The main goal for JetBlue is to ""humanize the brand,"" Headrick said. Like other airlines, JetBlue approached social networking sites by slowly scaling up its presence. American Airlines also took its time. Billy Sanez, director of customer communications, said the airline has been watching the growth of social media for several years. The interactive team brought up the idea of using Facebook about a year ago, Sanez said, and the airline added its fan page about four months ago. It has been increasing its use of the site by adding modules, including a yet-to-be-named feature that helps users find fares. ""We still have a lot to learn from customers and from how customers interact in these mediums,"" he said. ""But it has worked because we have been able to do targeted promotions to consumers, and because we have been able to get feedback from consumers, and in a very easy way."" Not to mention an inexpensive way. Mashable's Ostrow said social media is still a small part of most marketing budgets (not only for airlines but for many companies) but it is attractive because the costs are minimal. ""It also can be essentially cost-free to get started, since all one needs to do is open a Facebook, Twitter or YouTube account and get creative,"" Ostrow said. ""In a down economy, the low cost of entry certainly makes social media even more attractive than it might have already been otherwise."" As for the unfavorable comments people post, American Airlines' Sanez says it can be a chance to turn a negative experience into something positive. He thinks it can be good for customers to use the forum to get something off their chest. The airline looks for opportunities to interact with users. If people want to express something, let them express it, he said. If they are frustrated, they should be able to complain. ""If they want a resolution, we want to engage them and come up with options and get them to the right people with the right information,"" he said. Twitter followers and Facebook fans can also get the scoop on fare sales. JetBlue has a Twitter feed called JetBlueCheeps, where travelers can get some last-minute deals. For instance, on Monday, September 7, the airline posted on its Twitter feed that there were 25 seats available on a flight from New York's LaGuardia to Orlando, Florida, for $39. Tickets for the Saturday flight had to be purchased by 6 p.m. Monday evening. Headrick said that JetBlue times Twitter updates to coincide with releases to the media. While airlines appear to be happy so far with the results they are getting from their social media ventures, some are still not ready to expand dramatically just yet. Headrick said JetBlue was studying how to use Facebook. Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines has established its social media presence with more than 600,000 followers on Twitter and more than 76,000 fans on Facebook. Other major carriers also have thousands of followers on Twitter. Delta Air Lines, for instance, has about 11,000 followers, while United Airlines has more than 33,000 watchers. Continental is also looking at Facebook and other sites where a presence makes sense, according to airline spokeswoman Mary Clark. Continental is focusing on Twitter, where it has about 3,000 followers, and FlyerTalk.com, a Web site devoted to frequent flyers, she said.","Some airlines have at least one worker dedicated to watching Twitter and Facebook .

"Washington (CNN) -- More than half of all adult Americans say they don't want to get the H1N1 flu vaccine, according to a new national poll. The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Wednesday also indicates that the number of adults who have tried to get the vaccine but were turned away is higher than the number of adults who have gotten a swine flu shot. According to the poll, 55 percent of adults don't want to get the swine flu vaccine and don't plan to get a shot. Another one in five say they want to get inoculated but haven't taken any steps to do so; 14 percent want a shot and have tried to get it but have been unsuccessful. Just 7 percent have been inoculated for H1N1. Why are more than half of all Americans shunning the vaccine? ""The perception that the vaccine has dangerous side effects is the top reason,"" says CNN polling director Keating Holland. ""Roughly half of those who don't want a swine flu shot say that the possibility of side effects is one reason why they don't plan to get the vaccine. That works out to 28 percent of the adult population who don't plan to get inoculated due to the risk of dangerous side effects."" So far officials of the National Institutes of Health say they've seen no serious side effects in clinical trials and that study subjects who have been immunized have generated a good response. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the vaccine for certain high-priority groups because they are more likely to have serious complications if they develop swine flu. These groups include: pregnant women; caregivers and household contacts of children younger than 6 months; everyone between the ages of 6 months and 24 years; and people ages 25 to 64 with existing health problems. Most frequently asked H1N1 questions . One in four American adults say they don't plan on getting a shot because they are not in a high-risk group, with 21 percent indicating they don't plan on getting vaccinated because they only go to a doctor when they are sick. Most of those respondents are men. What about the 14 percent who have unsuccessfully tried to get the vaccine? ""Some say they don't know where to go. That works out to 4 percent of the total adult population who want to get inoculated but haven't been able to locate a medical facility that is giving swine flu shots,"" Holland said. ""A bigger group, 5 percent of the total population, say that they found a facility with the vaccine but were turned away because they were not in a high-risk group or for some other reason. And 3 percent of all adults say they found a facility that had the vaccine but it ran out before they got there."" Add together those last two groups, and the number of Americans who actively sought the vaccine but were turned away for some reason is 8 percent of the total adult population, roughly the same number as the 7 percent who have been inoculated so far. The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted November 13-15, with 1,014 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. CNN deputy political director Paul Steinhauser and senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen contributed to this report .","CNN poll shows 55 percent of adults don't want to get the H1N1 vaccine .

"Swiftwater, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Vaccine manufacturing giant Sanofi Pasteur opened its doors to the media Wednesday, inviting reporters to a first-of-its-kind, up-close look at its H1N1 flu vaccine production facility. Sanofi, the only manufacturer licensed to make H1N1 vaccine in the United States, also released its final clinical trial data, a 42-day follow-up of its adult and pediatric trials. According to this latest data, a single dose of H1N1 vaccine induces a strong immune response in adults, but two doses will be needed for children 6 months to 9 years of age. ""These are extremely important data,"" said Wayne Pisano, president and CEO of Sanofi Pasteur, ""because they once again make clear not only the immunogenicity of Influenza A [H1N1] 2009 Monovalent Vaccine manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur, but also the fact that this vaccine has a safety profile similar to that observed with seasonal influenza vaccine in all age groups studied."" According to Sanofi, there were no serious adverse incidents associated with vaccination. While no cameras were allowed inside the production facility during the tour, journalists were taken through the bulk influenza vaccine manufacturing facility, where the virus is injected into eggs to produce vaccine; the quality contol and sterility lab, where safety testing is done; and the formulation and filling facility, where single dose syringes and multidose vials are filled. In response to questions about criticisms over a shortage of vaccine, Chris Viehbacher, CEO of parent company Sanofi Aventis, said he has 2,000 employees on-site 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Viehbacher said the facility is producing 5 million doses a week, and that will increase to between 9 million and 10 million by early December. By the end of this week, Sanofi will have shipped 20 million doses of H1N1 vaccine, according to the company. According to Viehbacher, Sanofi will be on target to ship the entire 75 million doses ordered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services by the end of the year. ""We are all working as fast as we can,"" Viehbacher said. ""Everyone would like to have more vaccine now but we have what we have. Those not at risk should have some degree of patience."" Sanofi also will deliver 50 million doses of seasonal flu vaccine before the end of the month, the company said. By the end of the year, ""125 million doses of both vaccines [seasonal and H1N1] will be out the door,"" Viehbacher said. He added that it is important to understand that 85 percent of the manufacturing process is testing and quality control, not growing the vaccine. Sanofi, the largest vaccine company in the world, makes more than 45 percent of the flu vaccine distributed in the United States and about 40 percent of the world's supply.","Journalists given tour of vaccine manufacturing area .

"(CNN) -- Dallas has long been a sociological curiosity. With its mix of sweeping ranches and high-end shopping, it's sort of a ""country meets culture"" destination. And you don't have to drive all over the metroplex (as the locals call the Dallas-Fort Worth area) to have a good time. All the food, fun and fanciness can be found in the 1.5-mile radius of downtown. While the core of downtown Dallas has always been a thriving business district, it only recently began to attract visitors after 5 p.m. Dinner and a museum . Take restaurants, for example. Drive down any downtown street and it's clear that food is definitely a big part of Big D. ""Dallas has more restaurants per capita than New York City,"" says John Crawford, president and CEO of DowntownDallas, a private organization that serves as downtown Dallas' leading advocate. He says that in the downtown area alone, there are 250 places to dine, ranging from the elegant French Room (1321 Commerce St.) in the grand Adolphus hotel to family-friendly pizza joint Campisi's (1520 Elm St., Suite. 111). The fare is versatile, too: Sure, Dallas does Tex-Mex well, but the town also boasts plenty of places that offer twists on the basic burrito. Fuse (1512 Commerce St., Suite 100), a hip eatery that opened in 2006, serves up dishes like brisket pot stickers in a style they refer to as ""TexAsian."" The only thing that rivals the restaurant scene in downtown Dallas is the arts scene. It's true. ""We've got the largest urban arts district in the country,"" says Crawford. ""It stretches across 17 continuous square blocks."" This includes the renowned Dallas Museum of Art (1717 N. Harwood) and the Nasher Sculpture Center (2001 Flora St.). Visitors often overlook the Crow Collection of Asian Art (2010 Flora St.), and it's free. For music there's the Meyerson Symphony Center (2301 Flora St.), and theater buffs can see plays, musicals and big-name comedy acts like Jay Leno at the Majestic (1925 Elm St.). Downtown's revival . While the core of downtown Dallas has always been a thriving business district, it only recently began to attract visitors after 5 p.m. Like most cities, Dallas felt the effects of suburban sprawl in the early '90s. In fact, as recently as 1996, only 200 people called the central business district home, according to Crawford. Now he estimates that in the next 18 months, there will be more than 7,000 residents just in the core of downtown. Crawford and his colleagues believe people are migrating downtown partly because of revitalization efforts and partly because of environmental concerns related to long commutes. Whatever the reason, visitors to downtown Dallas are certainly benefiting from all of this migration. ""As you get more residential, you get a number of supporting services, and that's probably the reason for the number of restaurants that we have and the level of activity that's occurring,"" Crawford says. Shopping and bar hopping . Included in that hustle and bustle is Dallas' favorite pastime -- shopping. First, there's downtown's flagship store, Neiman Marcus (1618 Main St.), which is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year. The Dallas-born department store paved the way for other retailers to set up shop downtown, including national chains like high-end men's clothing store Jos. A. Bank (1508 Commerce St.) and smaller, stylish boutiques like edgy and sophisticated Crimson in the City (1514 Commerce St.). After a day of downtown shopping, you'll probably be inclined to check out the Dallas nightlife. (Where else are you going to show off your purchases?) Again, there's no need to leave the downtown area: You could hit the historic West End, where the preserved 19th-century buildings now house 21st-century attractions like restaurants and bars. It's got its share of obvious places like TGI Friday's, but also unusual eateries like Y.O. Ranch Steakhouse, which features an extensive wild game menu. For the opposite take on the city, go to the opposite side of downtown. On the east end, you'll find funky Deep Ellum, where the vibe is young, artsy and eclectic. The area is known for its live music scene with bars like Club Dada (2720 Elm St.) featuring up-and-coming and even well-known acts. Even dinner can be offbeat if you check out Monica's Aca Y Alla (2914 Main St.). Folks come for the unique Mexican dishes as well as to sneak a peek at Monica, the restaurant's transgender owner. Uptown holds the newest side of downtown -- Victory Park. The highlight of this area is the posh W Hotel (2440 Victory Park Lane) which boasts the trendy Ghostbar on its 33rd floor. Discriminating tastes will also appreciate N9NE Steakhouse. And just when Victory Park starts to feel like a mini-Vegas, you'll spot the colossal American Airlines Center (2500 Victory Ave.), home to the Dallas Mavericks and the Dallas Stars (just another reminder that even among all of this Victory Park privilege, you're still in sports-loving Texas). Family favorites . Don't forget the kids; there's plenty for them downtown, too. The Dallas World Aquarium (1801 N. Griffin St.) offers marine life from around the globe in its 85,000 gallons of water. Plus, the rainforest section of the venue has non-sea creatures from South America like monkeys and toucans. For some history, families can visit The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza (411 Elm St.) in the West End. The National Historic Landmark District is the site of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The permanent exhibit focuses on the days leading up to the tragedy as well as the impact it had on the world. Mild Texas temperatures allow visitors to be outdoors throughout all four seasons. And since there are more than 200 events every year, there's sure to be some sort of festival or parade going on, no matter when you visit. So pack your shopping shoes, your love of art and your appetite and head to Big D (cowboy hat optional).

"(Tribune Media Services) -- Six hundred years ago, Brussels was just a nice place to stop and buy a waffle on the way to France. Today, it's a city of 1.8 million, the capital of Belgium, the headquarters of NATO and the political center of the European Union. It may be easy to skip as you zip from Amsterdam to Paris by train, but its rich brew of food and culture pleasantly surprises those who stop. Its magnificent grand square, rightly named La Grand Place, alone makes a visit worthwhile. When in Brussels, try mussels with a side of crispy fries, or frites. The city is still buzzing over the opening of its new Magritte Museum in June. With more than 250 paintings, it has the world's largest collection of works by surrealist Rene Magritte, who famously painted a picture of a pipe and wrote on the canvas ""this is not a pipe."" Take time to wander through Brussels' other excellent museums. The Ancient Art Museum, featuring Flemish and Belgian art, has a dazzling collection of masterpieces by Van der Weyden, Breughel, Bosch and Rubens. The Museum of Modern Art next door also makes for an enjoyable stroll. Brussels has its silliness, too. Its mascot is the Manneken-Pis, a fountain statue of a little boy who lives up to his name. You'll find him three blocks off La Grand Place, possibly wearing some clever outfit. By tradition, countries send him costumes from around the world. Cases full of these are on display in the City Museum on La Grand Place. The Atomium, another of Brussels' offbeat attractions, looms on the edge of town. This gigantic, silvery iron ""molecule"" has escalators connecting the various ""atoms,"" fun space-age videos and a view from the top sphere. If you're scared of heights or tight spaces, tell your friends you'll wave to them ... from the ground. If you're hungry, muscle your way into a restaurant to order mussels in Brussels. They're served everywhere. You get a big-enough-for-two bucket and a pile of fries. Use an empty shell to tweeze out the rest of the mussels. Don't call fried potatoes ""French fries."" Belgian fries (""frites"") taste so good because they're deep-fried twice -- once to cook, and once to brown. The locals dunk them in mayonnaise, especially delicious if the mayo is flavored with garlic. My favorite budget meal in Brussels is having simple pub grub in an atmospheric old pub with a gaggle of ""beer pilgrims,"" who've flocked here from around the world to appreciate some of Europe's best brew and selection -- more than 300 Belgian varieties. To get a budget hotel deal, visit in peak season without a reservation, when the city's fancy business-class hotels rent rooms for half-price. Normal hotel prices are high, but if you arrive in July, August or on a Friday or Saturday night any other time, three-star hotels abound with amazing summer rates -- you can rent a double room with enough comforts to keep a diplomat happy, including a fancy breakfast, for about $85. Go through the tourist information office to get the best price. If you're nervous about traveling without advance reservations, contact the tourist office by email (info@visitflanders.be) and ask which business-class hotels will have special rates during your visit. Bone up on bonjour and s'il vous plait. Brussels speaks French. Though the city (and country) is officially bilingual and filled with foreign visitors, 80 percent of the locals speak French first and English second, if at all. Belgium is split between Wallonia in the south, where they speak French, and Flanders in the north, where they speak Flemish, a dialect of Dutch. French-speakers have often dominated the national government, which irks the Flemish, who comprise about 60 percent of the Belgian population. The longstanding rivalry has made it increasingly difficult for the Belgian Parliament to form a stable coalition government. One prime minister recently said that Belgians are united only by the king, a love of beer and the national soccer team. While the Belgians debate their unity, Brussels is the administrative center of the European Union. It hosts business people from around the world -- only Washington, D.C., has more lobbyists. When Europeans have a gripe, this is where they demonstrate. The European Parliament, a towering complex of glass skyscrapers, has 785 members representing 28 countries and more than 450 million citizens. Take the audioguide tour. It's exciting just to be here -- a mouse in the corner of a place that aspires to chart the future of Europe. Brussels is one of Europe's great secrets. A trade boom 500 years ago left this city with striking art and stately architecture. And it's once again a trade and cultural center of Europe.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A New York state Supreme Court judge Friday granted a temporary restraining order against a requirement that all health care workers in the state get H1N1 flu vaccinations. New York wants all health workers to get flu vaccines. The state health commissioner had said the workers had to be vaccinated against both seasonal and H1N1 flu by November 30 or risk disciplinary action. The Public Employees Federation filed suit, and Judge Thomas McNamara on Friday granted the restraining order, which will be in effect at least until the State Supreme Court can review the case during a hearing scheduled for October 30. In a news release, federation President Kenneth Brynien called the decision ""a big step in the right direction."" Peter Banks, a council leader for the organization, added that its members ""are not against the vaccination program; what we are against is the mandating, putting conditions of service over an unproven vaccine."" A state health department release said officials ""are confident that the regulation will be upheld."" It cited a 1990 court ruling that rejected health care workers' opposition to mandatory rubella vaccinations. Banks noted that ruling ""allows a philosophical or religious opt out,"" which he said is lacking in the emergency H1N1 regulation.

"(CNN) -- Mary Peterson of Des Moines, Washington, doesn't believe the vaccine for the novel H1N1 flu has been studied enough to get it for herself and her daughters, who are 1 and 3 years old. Mary Peterson's daughters, 3 and 1, will not be getting the new vaccine, she said. ""I wrestled with it,"" she said. ""I think the side of caution in this case is just waiting until we have more information."" Peterson is one of many parents who are discussing -- whether in real life or on Twitter -- their skepticism of the vaccine. The vaccine is being distributed as an intranasal spray this week, and will arrive next week in injection form, said Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, earlier this week. The CDC and other public health authorities say the new vaccine is safe, and are encouraging everyone to get it, especially those in high risk groups. But experts acknowledge that many people struggle with the decision.  Take a quiz about H1N1 flu Â» . ""I bet half the people in the country have concerns,"" Dr. Mehmet Oz, host of the ""Dr. Oz Show"" and professor of surgery at Columbia University, told CNN's Anderson Cooper earlier this week. ""Be knowledgeable, though, that the H1N1 swine flu vaccine is built on a chassis of the older original seasonal vaccine. So, it should have similar risks, which have proven to be very low,"" he said. Priority groups for the vaccine include pregnant women, caregivers and household contacts of children younger than 6 months, people between the ages of 6 months and 24 years, and anyone ages 25 to 64 with existing health problems, according to the CDC. A recent survey from the Harvard School of Public Health found that just 40 percent of adults say they are ""absolutely certain"" they will get the H1N1 vaccine. An additional 41 percent said they ""will not get it,"" and the rest of the sample had various degrees of certainty. iReport.com: Are you getting the vaccine? ""You've got a significant group of people who at the moment wouldn't do it,"" said Robert Blendon, professor of health policy and political analysis at the Harvard School of Public Health, who led the study. Still, nearly 60 percent of those who say they don't think they'll get vaccinated would change their minds if there were sickness or death in their community, the study found.  See H1N1 in your geographic area Â» . Moreover, 51 percent of parents said they were ""absolutely certain"" to get it for their children. Again, about 60 percent of the skeptical parents would change their mind in the event of community sickness and death. One major group of people who say they probably won't get the vaccine are those primarily concerned about safety, Blendon said. Peterson isn't against all vaccines -- she and her daughters have already gotten the seasonal flu vaccine, for example. But she is concerned about mercury in some of the new vaccine varieties. Thimerosal, a mercury preservative found in the multi-dose vial H1N1 vaccines, has been controversially linked to autism, though no studies have proved that theory. Peterson said she is also concerned about the toxicity of mercury. But the CDC says there is no evidence that thimerosal is harmful to pregnant women or fetuses. Vaccine companies are making vaccine types for both seasonal flu and H1N1 flu without this mercury-based preservative. The other main reason that people cite for not getting the vaccine is that they do not believe they are vulnerable to the disease, Blendon said. Crystal Fincher, who works in sales in Seattle, Washington, has both safety and vulnerability in mind. She has decided against vaccinating herself and her 12-year-old son both because she doesn't believe there is enough safety information about it, and because she doesn't think she and her son are in high-risk groups. Fincher said her son's own physician told her the risks of combining the new H1N1 vaccine with his other scheduled vaccines -- for example, tetanus and diphtheria -- are not yet known. ""I just don't feel like there's a risk of having a complication from swine flu is high enough to proceed to taking that, but I would be open in the future once there was more data available,"" she said. Teresa Rogers, a pharmacy technician in Rockford, Michigan, said she will not be getting the swine flu vaccine because she believes it has not been tested enough. Her children, who are grown, will probably not get it either, and her co-workers at the pharmacy are split. ""I'm not going to be a guinea pig,"" she said. But Karen Walrond, a photographer and writer in Houston, Texas, said she will vaccinate her 5-year-old daughter, whose asthma flares up as a result of colds and flus. ""We will probably go ahead and risk it,"" she said. Walrond herself will probably also get vaccinated, if only ""in moral support"" of her daughter, she said. Oz said he will get the vaccine, but his wife will not, and the kids will go along with her, as in most families. ""I think we're going to have this battle within American families and within our culture. It should be a productive one, though,"" he said. ""It's about getting the middle mass of Americans to say, 'You know what, this is what I think: I'm going to go with the system and get the vaccine.' ""","Dr. Mehmet Oz: ""I bet half the people in the country have concerns""

"DORCHESTER, Massachusetts (CNN) -- A bell tolled atop Boston's Faneuil Hall on Thursday as the body of Sen. Edward Kennedy passed through the streets, while mourners lined up outside his late brother's presidential library for a chance to say goodbye. Members of the public file past Sen. Edward Kennedy's coffin at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library. Kennedy lay in repose Thursday evening after his flag-draped casket arrived at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library from the family's Hyannis Port compound on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. An estimated 1,600 people had lined up to view the casket as of 5 p.m., an hour before friends, family and constituents began to file past. Kennedy died Tuesday night in Hyannis Port after a 15-month battle with brain cancer. He was 77, and had represented Massachusetts in the Senate since 1962. As his cortege passed through Boston, a bell at Faneuil Hall was rung 47 times -- once for each of Kennedy's 47 years in office.  Watch well wishers say goodbye to Kennedy Â» . Faneuil Hall was where Kennedy launched his ill-fated 1980 presidential campaign, and it was one of several stops the procession made along the way. It crossed the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway, a park named for the senator's mother and one-time family matriarch, and passed the Massachusetts State House and the home that John Kennedy lived in when he first ran for Congress in 1946.

"Editor's note: Maura O'Connell, a native of County Clare, Ireland, records for Sugar Hill Records. Her current album is ""Naked With Friends."" Singer Maura O'Connell says one of Ted Kennedy's favorite songs, ""A Family Tie,"" spoke to his love of family. (CNN) -- In 1992, I had the pleasure of singing at the wedding of Sen. Edward Kennedy to Victoria Reggie. I had never met him, nor was I aware that he had even heard of me. To say I was surprised would be an understatement. He made the call himself to my home number. My housemate hung up on him, believing it was a hoax, but he eventually left a number for me to contact. When we spoke the next day, he told me how much he enjoyed my singing and named particular songs that meant a great deal to him. One of those songs is ""A Family Tie"" by Hugh Prestwood, which speaks to the idea of unconditional love within a family. I can only assume that it had particular resonance for him. We discussed the song and many others that were favorites of his and, of course, I agreed to sing at the wedding. We spoke a few more times before the wedding and he sounded like any other man who was delighted to be marrying the woman he loved. I was thrilled to be involved. The Kennedys have been a huge part of the Irish psyche since I was a child. In many houses back then, there were pictures of the pope and John F. Kennedy. The fact that he was proudly Irish was a huge boost for our national ego at the time. My family had a very special photograph that was on top of our piano all my life. It was a picture of my father with Ted Kennedy that was taken in the early '60s at the Shannon Airport duty free store, where my father worked at the time. We were all very proud of that, so when I got the call about singing at the wedding, the first person I told was my dad. On the day of the wedding, my musicians Richard McLaurin and Zane Baxter and I were brought to Kennedy's house and escorted to the senator's home office. There were so many iconic pictures on the walls it was disconcerting. He made time to come and visit us and was about as genial a host as I have ever encountered. He talked about his bride-to-be in glorious terms, shared the story of his proposal to Vicki, and answered questions about the various pictures around the room. He was relaxed and happy. The wedding itself was beautiful. It was just very close family. There was a civil ceremony and then a blessing. I sang some songs during the ceremony, and then a few afterwards. He joined in here and there, but God bless him, he hadn't a note in his head. He had requested that I sing the old standard ""You'll Never Know"" which I had recorded, and he and his bride danced, looking into each other's eyes. He gave Vicki a painting of daffodils he had painted as a wedding gift. A few days later, a framed signed print of the painting was delivered to my home. What a thoughtful gesture. Ever since then we kept in contact. They came to see me play at the Birchmere, a music hall in Alexandria, Virginia, a few times. I sang at various events the senator was involved in, most recently at a fundraiser for his re-election. It was not a one-sided friendship though. A few years ago I accompanied my son to Washington to take part in a young leaders of America camp. I was a bit surprised when I found out there was to be no real interaction with any serving politician. On the day that we were to tour the major sites, I decided to call Kennedy's office at the Russell Senate building. I explained to his wonderful assistant, Sharon Waxman, what I was doing in Washington and asked if the senator would mind waving at the hordes from his office window. She called me back about 10 minutes later to say the senator had cleared some time in the afternoon, and he would speak to the group in the little park opposite the building. He spoke to the kids about his first time in Washington and how his brother John, a senator at the time, showed him around. He told them how inspiring it was to see how government worked and that he knew right then that he wanted to be a public servant. He was playful, too, and told them lots of silly stories about his dog. Afterwards he agreed to be photographed with the group. I believe that many young people gathered there may have been inspired by his stories and may prove to be the next generation of humanistic Democrats. He loved his country. He loved to serve, but most of all he dearly loved his wife and family. I will miss him, too -- even his singing. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Maura O'Connell.","Maura O'Connell: Ted Kennedy asked me to sing at his wedding .

"(CNN) -- Using archival footage and photographs, producers Peter Kunhardt and Sheila Nevins made the HBO documentary ""Teddy: In His Own Words,"" which follows the life of U.S. Sen. Ted Kennedy. Sen. Ted Kennedy ""worked like a bull"" to advance his brothers' unfinished work, Peter Kunhardt says. The film profiles Kennedy, who died late Tuesday, from birth through his speech last year at the Democratic National Convention. Kunhardt began the project after Kennedy was diagnosed with brain cancer last year. Kunhardt previously profiled Kennedy's brothers, President John F. Kennedy and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, in similar documentaries for HBO. On Wednesday, CNN asked Kunhardt about the production of the latest profile -- which CNN will show Wednesday night -- and what he learned about the youngest of the Kennedy brothers. CNN: Why focus on Ted Kennedy? Why were you drawn to him as a subject? Was it the natural follow-up to your previous work about his brothers? Peter Kunhardt: I grew up with parents who were liberal Democrats. I remember my mother crying as she listened to the radio report that President Kennedy had been shot. So nearly 20 years ago, when I produced ""JFK: In His Own Words"" for HBO, it was a subject I knew and cared a lot about. I knew less about Robert Kennedy when I produced ""Bobby: In His Own Words"" a few years later -- and even less about Teddy. (Although my uncle, George Lodge, ran against him for Senate in 1962.) When I was producing those other documentaries on his brothers, Teddy was in his 50s, he was busy building his own career, and there was never even discussion about producing a program about him. It was too soon. Two decades later, when it was announced he was diagnosed with brain cancer and that he was coming up on nearly half a century in the Senate, HBO and I didn't even have to discuss it. We all instinctively knew it was time. CNN: Did you have preconceived notions about Kennedy that interviews either reinforced or dispelled? Kunhardt: My preconceived notion was that Teddy was the carefree younger brother who rode his brothers' coattails and did not work as hard as they did. But, yes, that was dispelled as we dug into his story and as our chief researcher, Jill Cowan, began finding the film to prove otherwise. No Kennedy ever worked harder then Edward Kennedy. I'd say he was a slow starter, but once he took on the responsibility for his big family in particular and for the Democratic Party in general, he never let up on himself. He worked like a bull. He stumbled plenty of times, he had personal faults, he caused others great pain, but he recognized this, he was pained by this, and each time he picked himself up and worked harder to make himself better. CNN: How did you obtain some of the rarely seen home movies and photographs used in the documentary? Kunhardt: We simply looked everywhere, and we knew we were onto something that had not been done before when so many sources told us that they had never been asked for Teddy-related material. In fact, often we were transferring 16mm footage that had never been transferred before. Even the networks were surprised by the outtakes we found in their archives. It's all there, it just took time and a dedicated staff. CNN: Were there any surprises during the filming of the documentary? Did someone say something remarkable or unexpected about Kennedy? Did a source material reveal something that is contrary to the Ted Kennedy many assume they know? Kunhardt: We did no original filming for this documentary; it is 100 percent created using historical footage and audio that was made during different points of Kennedy's life. That's what gives it authenticity, I think. It's something my partner at HBO, Sheila Nevins, insisted upon. And she was right. So sticking to the ""in his own words"" format of those original two docs was the single most important decision we made. CNN: Why do you think Americans cling to an idea of ""Camelot?"" What has Camelot come to mean in the Obama age? Kunhardt: President Obama himself clings to Camelot -- and made that very clear when he thanked Teddy for his early support. He, like so many Americans, was inspired first by Teddy's brothers, then by Teddy himself. And one of the things that impressed me was how Teddy Kennedy never ceased to try and continue to advance the unfinished work of his brothers. He was incredibly loyal to them and the causes they represented. I think when someone is rich and powerful and glamorous and stands up for his principles and looks after the neediest Americans and speaks out for the downtrodden around the world, it spells ""Camelot"" for a lot of people. CNN: Much has been made of Kennedy's relationship with President Obama. What did Kennedy say about that and about the relationship itself? Kunhardt: Kennedy made it very clear that he was handing over the mantle that he had been carrying ever since his brother handed it to him. I think he saw Obama as the embodiment of everything he believed in and everything that he had worked so hard to make happen. It must have been incredibly rewarding for him. CNN: What was Kennedy's reaction when the subject of Chappaquiddick was broached? How comfortable was he talking about it? Kunhardt: Again, we did not conduct a new interview, but instead we knit his story together from his responses to many earlier interview questions. Early on he was incredibly uncomfortable speaking about it, humiliated by it. He seemed to cringe and dodge and lower his head. But over time, he was asked about it so often that he built up a shield, a formula response to deflect the questions that never stopped coming. He knew that a life was lost because of his actions, but he moved on. That's what he did so often. He just moved on. CNN: What do you think Kennedy believed about how he was publicly perceived, both in politics and in his personal life? Kunhardt: He knew people loved him and hated him. His last campaign was his hardest, and he realized he had to regain the trust of many whose trust he had lost. And I think during the 80s, when he really did want to be president, he believed that the public would support him, despite Chappaquiddick. But that did not happen. Then, once he resolved to commit himself to the Senate, I think he was surprised that the public would never let go of this idea that he wanted to be president. CNN: What ultimately drove Kennedy as a politician? Kunhardt: His parents. At his mother's funeral he said that everything he and his brothers ever did, they did for their parents. And I believe this. He cared deeply about the issues he stood for, but you can't forget who instilled the work ethic in him in the first place. Teddy Kennedy was a family man because of the deep influence of his parents, particularly his mother.","Producer Peter Kunhardt: Project started after Kennedy's cancer diagnosis .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- For writer John Aravosis, Edward ""Ted"" Kennedy's early support for gay rights was very important to a community that has faced a history steeped in discrimination. Gay rights advocates say Sen. Ted Kennedy was a staunch supporter for their cause. ""On gay rights, he was absurdly helpful for a straight senator back before gay rights were popular,"" he said. Aravosis, who runs AmericaBlog -- a political site that often focuses on gay rights issues -- said it was Kennedy who sparked his interest in the movement. ""For me it was particularly personal since he gave me my start in gay rights,"" he said. ""I started doing volunteer work in his office in 1993 when I was still working for a Republican senator."" Unabashedly liberal, Kennedy had a long track record in support of gay rights. Former Massachusetts state Sen. Jarrett Barrios -- and incoming President of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation praised the Democratic senator's work. ""In those early years, his support may have turned heads but [that] didn't dampen his support -- and eventually helped change hearts and minds about LGBT [Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender] equality in the Senate and around the country,"" he said in a statement. Kennedy's death, Barrios noted, is deeply personal. ""He was a friend whom I worked with on many issues in the Massachusetts senate, and my husband Doug and I have the print he gave us for our wedding framed at home,"" he said. ""His passing is a loss for many of us who knew him, and all of us who benefited from his uncompromising support of our full equality."" Since his death warm wishes and remembrances have poured in from the gay community around the country. Marc Solomon, marriage director of Equality California, said he lost ""one of my heroes."" ""Thank you Sen. Kennedy, for making a future for us all that is more compassionate, more equitable, more just -- for LGBT people, for immigrants, for people of color, for those living in poverty, for every one of us. Your passion for justice and your fight burn on in us all,"" he wrote Thursday in Bay Windows, an LGBT newspaper serving New England.  Watch more on Kennedy's life and career Â» . Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese said the nation has ""lost its greatest champion and strongest voice for justice, fairness, and compassion. The loss to our community is immeasurable."" ""There was no greater hero for advocates of LGBT equality than Sen. Ted Kennedy,"" he said in a statement. Solmonese's group has repeatedly given Kennedy a 100 percent on its congressional scorecards for supporting gay rights. ""From the early days of the AIDS epidemic, to our current struggle for marriage equality he has been our protector, our leader, our friend. He has been the core of the unfinished quest for civil rights in this country and there is now a very painful void,"" Solmonese said. Kennedy co-sponsored the 1990 Ryan White CARE Act, which passed the same year. Later in 1996, he co-sponsored a bill to reverse the discharge of HIV-positive members of the military. He was also a staunch defender of hate crimes legislation in his Senate career. Kennedy was a key sponsor of the 2009 Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act, named after young gay man who was killed. The bill was approved by the Senate in July. ""No member of the LGBT community should be terrified to walk down the street for fear of hateful violence. Hate crimes perpetrators must not be allowed to place our communities in fear,"" he has said in the past. Kennedy also opposed the military's ""Don't ask, Don't tell"" policy adopted in 1993. The policy, which is still in place, ended the military's practice of asking potential service members if they were gay, but required the dismissal of openly gay service members. And on the controversial topic of same-sex marriage, Kennedy was at the forefront of opposing legislative efforts seeking to ban it. In 1996, he opposed the Clinton-era Defense of Marriage Act -- which is currently the law -- and fought to repeal it throughout the years. ""America stands for justice for all. Congress must make clear that when we say 'all' we mean all. America will never be America until we do,"" he said in a 2007 statement. In 2004, Kennedy lent his voice to the gay marriage debate in 2004 when the Massachusetts Supreme Court approved of same-sex marriage. It was the first state in the nation to do so, and paved the way for others states -- including Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont -- to follow suit. ""He played a critical role in helping protect the right of same-sex couples to marry in his beloved home state of Massachusetts,"" Solomon said. But Kennedy's views on same-sex marriage have come at odds with not only the Republican party, but also with close friends and allies in his own party -- most notably with President Obama, who is against same-sex marriage. Despite the differences, Kennedy -- known for reaching across the aisle to get legislation passed -- was steadfast, advocates note, in his support for equal rights. For Solomon, Kennedy's commitment and work was a truly enlightening experience. ""Working with Sen. Kennedy meant working in his aura. His work was always surrounded with mystique,"" he said.","Sen. Edward ""Ted"" Kennedy had a long track record in support of gay rights .

"(CNN) -- When cancer invades the brain, the prognosis is usually grim. Despite his treatment at highly regarded medical centers, Edward ""Ted"" Kennedy, who served as a Democratic senator from Massachusetts for nearly 47 years, died just over a year after his surgery. Kennedy suffered a seizure May 17, 2008, while walking his dogs at his home in Hyannis Port. Three days later, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston said a brain biopsy revealed a tumor, known as a malignant glioma, in the left parietal lobe. Malignant gliomas are the second-most common cause of death from cancer for people 15 to 44 years old, according to a 2005 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The causes of glioma tumors are mysterious. Many patients do not have genetic risk factors, and any connections with lifestyle are not clear, said Dr. Larry Junck, head of the Neuro-Oncology Program at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center. Junck was not involved in the senator's treatment. Gliomas do not often spread to other parts of the body, but grow into the brain at their site of origin, Junck said. Kennedy's doctors did not specify what type of malignant glioma he had. But the majority are glioblastomas, especially in older patients, said Dr. Tara Morrison, a neuro-oncologist at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Glioblastoma multiforme, which is the most common primary brain tumor, is aggressive and deadly. Typically diagnosed at age 55, it is not unusual for a glioblastoma to recur after treatment, according to the Mayo Clinic. Kennedy's treatment -- surgery, followed by radiation and chemotherapy -- would be familiar to many people who have faced cancer. The senator's treatment was  ""the standard of care for anyone with a malignant glioma,"" Morrison said. (Morrison also was not involved in Kennedy's treatment.) The senator underwent surgery at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, in June 2008. The goal of this kind of surgery is to remove as much tumor as possible, Morrison said.  See a timeline of Kennedy's life Â» . Surgery is usually followed by six weeks of radiation. Kennedy wrote in a Newsweek magazine article that he underwent proton-beam therapy, a type of radiation therapy, at Massachusetts General Hospital. The hospital is one of only six centers in the United States that offers proton radiotherapy, according to the nonprofit National Association for Proton Therapy. The theory behind proton therapy is that its high-energy particles zone in specifically on the tumor and so do not harm the surrounding healthy tissue as much as the X-ray photons in conventional therapy, said Dr. Donald O'Rourke, associate professor of neurosurgery at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. Despite the enthusiasm about this relatively new treatment, no evidence exists that shows proton-beam therapy is better than conventional therapy at getting rid of the tumor, nor does much data support the claim that it does less harm to healthy tissue, O'Rourke said. During the five weeks of radiation, a patient typically would take an oral chemotherapy drug called Temodar at a low dose every day, Morrison said. Then, a month-long break is followed by at least six months of Temodar at a higher dose. Treating malignant gliomas is especially hard because they grow in essential parts of the brain, so it's difficult to get every harmful cell out with surgery, Morrison said. ""It's very hard to remove large portions of the brain without causing functional problems in a patient,"" she said. The cancer cells also infiltrate structures beyond what a scan can show, she said. The average life expectancy is from 15 to 18 months after surgery, Morrison said. Only about 10 percent of patients are still alive after five years, Junck said. Researchers are looking at many other treatments for brain tumors. The drug Avastin, which is approved for patients whose glioblastoma tumors return, is in clinical trials for use after the initial diagnosis. The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke goes a step further, according to Dr. Henry Friedman, the center's deputy director. Friedman said the evidence for Avastin's benefit against recurrent tumors is so compelling that he's taken a ""leap of faith"" and includes the drug in the regimen for newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients whenever possible, even when they don't qualify for clinical trials. Immunotherapy is also being studied in clinical trials. Researchers take a portion of the tumor and grind it up with white blood cells from the patient, in hopes that the blood cells will learn to fight the cancer cells, Junck said. Then, the blood cells are injected into the patient to combat remaining tumor cells. The evidence from this approach has been inconclusive, he said. At the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, O'Rourke and colleagues are working on the first noninvasive technique to identify genetic mutations associated with glioblastomas. They have measured blood flow to the brain with magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI.  A certain level of blood flow is linked to an underlying gene mutation associated with poor prognosis. Researchers hope to use this as a diagnostic tool and as an aid in targeting therapy to specific genes. ""Perhaps more importantly, when you start treating these patients, if those changes in the MRI go away and it appears to be less aggressive, we may be able to say that our treatment is working,"" O'Rourke said. Already the researchers can use the MRI method to see if the patient is responding to treatment, and can make treatment selection based on it. They are still working on using it as a diagnostic tool. O'Rourke expects this method to be widely available with the next year or two. Further down the line, targeted nanoparticles -- submicroscopic particles coated with special substances that direct them to the tumor site and deliver high doses of chemicals -- may be used in treatments that have fewer side effects than drugs available today. Researchers at Argonne National Laboratory are going to test this approach in brain tumors in mice, but it will be at least five years before it could become available in humans. Read more about nanotechnology's promise for cancer . High-profile people such as Kennedy, who are battling malignant brain tumors, have increased awareness of the condition, O'Rourke said. There has also been a ""recent explosion"" of technology, such as surgical and imaging techniques, that have helped the survival rate, he said. ""I think in the next 10 years, we're going to see a situation in which we can really classify glioblastomas... and select the appropriate treatments accordingly,"" he said. CNN's Caleb Hellerman contributed to this report.","Malignant gliomas typically do not spread to other parts of the body .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The community organizing group ACORN on Wednesday announced a hiring freeze, new training programs and an independent review of its programs after the recent release of a series of videotapes embarrassing to the agency. In the videos, the individuals seek advice on setting up a brothel with underage women from El Salvador. The videos, secretly taped by two individuals posing as a pimp and a prostitute, showed ACORN employees in four of the agency's offices suggesting or condoning a series of illicit actions as the couple sought advice on setting up a brothel with underage women from El Salvador. ""We have all been deeply disturbed by what we've seen in some of these videos,"" ACORN CEO Bertha Lewis said. ""I must say on behalf of ACORN's board and our Advisory Council that we will go to whatever lengths necessary to re-establish the public trust."" The steps announced include an immediate halt in hiring for all ACORN offices, an immediate training program for all front-line staff and selection of an independent auditor by the end of this week.  Watch Lewis address the scandal Â» . As the announcement was made, FBI Director Robert Mueller appeared on Capitol Hill for a wide-ranging oversight hearing, and when asked about ACORN, he signaled a potential federal investigation of the organization. In response to a description of the highly publicized videotapes by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, Mueller said he had just learned of the matter. ""I think the first time I heard of this incident to which you refer was last evening,"" Mueller said. ""Clearly, given what you have said, it's something in consultation with the Department of Justice that we would look at."" At least 11 states have been investigating ACORN -- the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now -- for alleged voter registration fraud stemming from the general election in 2008. The statement issued by ACORN on Wednesday stands in sharp contrast to comments earlier in the week, in which a  spokesman called the recordings' release ""an orchestrated sham."" Spokesman Scott Levenson said the taping was an attempt to ""create news rather than report the news."" The videos by filmmaker James O'Keefe and his colleague Hannah Giles have caused ACORN to fire four employees shown on the tapes.  Watch some of the recordings Â» . The videos were shot in ACORN offices in New York; Baltimore, Maryland; Washington; and San Bernardino, California. ACORN claims that the film team also attempted to ""trick"" employees in several other cities to make incriminating statements but failed. Fallout from the publicity prompted the U.S. Senate this week to vote 83-7 to block Housing and Urban Development grants to ACORN. Lewis responded with a statement saying that although the organization was ""disappointed that the Senate took the rare and politically convenient step"" of cutting HUD grants, the move would have little effect. ""Fortunately, ACORN derives most of its income from its members and other supporters, so the decision will have little impact on overall operations,"" Lewis said.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- So far it has been a very sunny summer for newbie pop singer Kristinia DeBarge. Kristinia DeBarge has broken through with the summer hit ""Goodbye."" She has a Top 20 hit with ""Goodbye,"" a peppy pop number which borrows from Steam's 1969 stadium anthem ""Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye."" The energetic video just earned DeBarge an MTV Video Music Award nomination in the best choreography category. And later this month the 19-year-old will demonstrate her dance skills as the opening act for Britney Spears' global ""Circus"" tour. The L.A.-based singer is well connected in the music business: she's the daughter of James DeBarge, a member of the '80s R&B group DeBarge.  Her debut album, ""Exposed,"" dropped last week, and was produced by Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds.  Watch DeBarge tell her subject ""Goodbye"" Â» . Kristinia DeBarge (pronounced Kristi-NEE-ya) dropped in to CNN to talk about why her dad initially wanted her to follow a different career path, her different personalities and lip synching. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Your dad must have a wealth of advice for you. Kristinia DeBarge: Yes he does. His advice is stay true to yourself. He's also told me many times that I should have a lot of strength in this business, and that I'm going to need my family around me. CNN: He didn't want you to go into music, did he? DeBarge: No, because he knows how the music industry is. And some people can become a little jaded and tainted after. So he likes that I'm innocent and wants to keep that innocence fresh. CNN: What did he want you to do? DeBarge: Something like be a doctor or a veterinarian or a lawyer. I totally admire all those jobs. ... But it's not my passion. My passion is singing, so if I was to do those things I wouldn't be happy because I'd be like, what a waste of talent. I'm a singer. CNN: You were on the ""American Idol"" spin-off show ""American Juniors"" in 2003. What was that experience like? DeBarge: I had a lot of fun. I met a lot of different people on the show who are pursuing not only music but acting and modeling and all that fun stuff. It was really cool to interact with the kids my age because we were all there inspiring each other. CNN: What do you like about working with Babyface? DeBarge: I like that he's so down to earth and he's open-minded. He's open-minded in the sense where he allows me to have a lot of input on my music. He allows me to write with him and then bring in other writers and other producers. ... He's like another dad to me. He's very protective and sweet. CNN: Whose idea was it to borrow from Steam? DeBarge: The producers and the songwriters. ... And I was like gosh, what a great idea. Maybe I could take over the old version that's playing at basketball games and the hockey games! Even for people who don't really like pop music ... they can listen to that song and sing along to it. CNN: Tell me a little bit about your album. DeBarge: I named it ""Exposed"" because I feel that in introducing myself to the world you're getting to know Kristinia from all angles. So you're going to get to know all different characteristics and personalities that she has. CNN: Does she have many personalities? DeBarge: Sometimes, but they're good. They're good personalities. She's just like everyone else. And that's also something that I want to make clear on the album -- that I'm very normal and I experience all of the same things that 19-year-old girls go through. ...  It's my first album and I'm hoping that everyone from little girls to older women will really be able to relate to it. CNN: Are you excited about being one of the opening acts for Britney Spears? DeBarge: Yes, I'm really excited about that. ... She's a great performer and entertainer and I think that she has so many fans and so to gain her fans is going to be great for me. And I mean the fact that she even approved of it is great. CNN: What are your thoughts on lip-syncing? DeBarge: I would say that I understand it, but if you're a vocalist it's good to sing. ... I love to perform. I also like to sing. [When I performed on] ""So You Think You Can Dance"" I sang and I was dancing, so a lot of people were like ""Is she lip-syncing?"" But I was really just singing as well. It's really hard to do. People think it's a lot easier than it is.","Kristinia DeBarge has a hit with ""Goodbye,"" borrowed from '69 Steam hit .

"(CNN) -- It may be months before Edward Kennedy's Senate seat is filled, following his death at the age of 77 on Tuesday. The seat may remain in Kennedy hands. His sons, Edward Kennedy Jr. and Rep. Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island, have been mentioned as possible successors, as has his nephew, former Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II. Edward Kennedy's wife, Victoria Reggie Kennedy, has no interest in filling the seat, a source close to the senator said. A long-term vacancy could have effects far beyond Kennedy's home state of Massachusetts, since his death deprives Democrats of the 60-vote ""supermajority"" with which they can theoretically force laws through the Senate despite Republican objections. Under Massachusetts law, a special election must be held 145 to 160 days after a Senate seat becomes vacant. The winner of that election serves the remainder of a senator's unexpired term. Just last week, Kennedy urged that the law be changed to allow the governor to appoint a temporary replacement until the special election can be held. In a letter to Gov. Deval Patrick and other state leaders, Kennedy said he supports the current law, but added, ""I also believe it is vital for [Massachusetts] to have two voices speaking for the needs of its citizens and two votes in the Senate during the approximately five months between a vacancy and an election."" Kennedy asked the governor and state leaders to ""amend the law through the normal legislative process to provide for a temporary gubernatorial appointment until the special election occurs."" Patrick said Wednesday that he is in favor of the change and would sign it into law if the state legislature passed it. He said Kennedy's proposal for an interim appointment until a special election was ""entirely reasonable."" ""I think particularly now, when you think about the momentous change legislation that is pending in the Congress today, Massachusetts needs two voices,"" Patrick said in an interview with Boston radio station WBUR. Kennedy's letter is dated July 2 but was not sent until August 19 -- less than a week before he died. Kennedy, who had been having conversations with several top state Democrats about a potential succession, was concerned that releasing the letter would disrupt intense and tumultuous Senate health care negotiations, a source close to the senator said. Kennedy sent the letter when he did only because the Boston Globe newspaper learned about the discussions and was prepared to print what he thought was an inaccurate account of his efforts, according to that source and another person close to Kennedy. He decided to make his desires clear by delivering the letter, knowing it would go public. Kennedy has championed universal health care for years and wanted to make sure Democrats have the votes they may need for passage of a comprehensive bill. He called the issue ""the cause of my life,"" and he hoped to see legislation that would ""guarantee that every American will have decent, quality health care as a fundamental right,"" as he said at the 2008 Democratic Convention. iReport.com: Share tributes to Kennedy . Democrats -- who, in collaboration with independent Sens. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, now control 59 of the 99 occupied seats in the 100-member Senate -- face a tough battle this fall on President Obama's health care reform package. They have been trying to calculate votes without Kennedy, who was unable to attend many sessions for months because of his illness. Until 2004, Massachusetts law allowed the governor to appoint an immediate replacement in the event of a U.S. Senate vacancy. The heavily Democratic legislature changed the law, however, after Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry became the likely Democratic presidential nominee -- when Republican Mitt Romney was governor. Critics charged the Democrats were trying to prevent Romney from replacing Kerry with a Republican in the event of a Kerry victory over President George W. Bush. It is not clear who will replace Kennedy in the seat he had held since 1962. He died 15 months after being diagnosed with brain cancer. His brother, the late President John F. Kennedy, had the seat for almost eight years before being elected to the White House in 1960. The old law may have helped the Senate seat stay in the family. When John Kennedy was elected president, Edward Kennedy was not yet old enough to be a senator. Kennedy family friend Benjamin Smith was appointed to the seat but did not run in 1962 when John Kennedy's term expired, clearing the way for Edward Kennedy. Kennedy was last re-elected in November 2006. His term runs until January 2013. CNN's Rebecca Sinderbrand, Dana Bash and Martina Stewart contributed to this report.","NEW: Massachusetts governor says he'd OK change if state legislature passed it .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The young senator inspired a new generation of voters with his message of change and extended America's hand to the global community in an effort to promote a different kind of diplomacy. One magazine characterized him as having a ""quick charm, the patience to listen, a sure social touch, an interest in knowledge and a greed for facts."" A biographer recalled that he ""had to touch the secret fears and ambivalent longings of the American heart, divine and speak to the desires of a swiftly changing nation -- his message grounded on his own intuition of some vague and spreading desire for national renewal."" Those words could have been written about Barack Obama's rise to the presidency last year but actually come from coverage about the ascendancy of John F. Kennedy to the White House. Kennedy's presidency is remembered as ""Camelot,"" for the Broadway show about an idealized King Arthur's Court that opened the month after Kennedy won the presidency in November 1960. After JFK's assassination in 1963, the Camelot legacy was handed down to younger brother Robert Kennedy, who served as John Kennedy's attorney general and was later elected to the Senate from New York. Ted Kennedy assumed the mantle after Robert Kennedy was assassinated during his run for the presidency in 1968. And with the death of the youngest Kennedy brother, the question arises: Has Obama become the Kennedy family's heir apparent? Many saw Kennedy's endorsement of Obama in the Democratic primaries last year as his handing the keys to Camelot to someone outside the family. Kennedy's son Patrick, a Democratic congressman from Rhode Island, has kept a relatively low profile in Congress and has faced substance abuse problems that have led to stints in rehab facilities. JFK's daughter, Caroline, stepped into the political spotlight recently, only later to drop out of the running for Hillary Clinton's vacant Senate seat. Robert Kennedy's son Joe was derailed after a messy personal life involving a high-profile annulment, and Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the former lieutenant governor of Maryland, has largely stayed out of the spotlight. Others, like Robert Kennedy Jr., have careers in public service outside of government. But Stephen Hess, a former staffer in the Eisenhower and Nixon administrations and an adviser to presidents Ford and Carter, says that right now, there are no other Kennedys to assume Ted Kennedy's place in American politics. ""These families can kind of go into a quiet state and then can flare up again. ... It doesn't look like there is a Kennedy in the immediate future and the nation's political history,"" he said. ""No one will ever count out the Kennedys, and so there will be others."" ""We often keep turning to the same names. ... At the moment, it does not appear that there will be a Kennedy in the Congress other than his son,"" he added. Hess, who wrote the book ""America's Political Dynasties,"" says that while there are comparisons to be made, Obama is not necessarily the heir apparent. ""He's a voice of his own, had his own agenda. ... He will build his own legacy,"" he said of the president. Sen. Kennedy, deemed the Lion of the Senate, was an early, vocal supporter of Obama's primary and general election campaigns, despite having a longtime history with the Clintons. In late January 2007, Kennedy endorsed Obama and drew parallels to his brother's legendary Camelot and the ""new frontier."" ""I remember another such time, in the 1960s, when I came to the Senate at the age of 30. We had a new president who inspired the nation, especially the young, to seek a new frontier,"" Kennedy said. ""I know what America can achieve. I've seen it. I've lived it. And with Barack Obama, we can do it again."" Douglas Brinkley, a well-known presidential historian and professor at Rice University, says it's not sure that Obama would have won the Democratic nomination without Kennedy's endorsement and that noteworthy part of his speech. ""At that famous moment when Sen. Kennedy endorsed Obama, it was handing over the Kennedy legacy to him,"" he said. The Kennedy dynasty, known for a history of national public service, has spent decades championing the rights of working men and women, with an emphasis on health care, education and community service programs, among other things. The family, often considered America's royals, has faced tragedy and success. ""The Kennedys have become the charismatic political family of the 20th century,"" Brinkley added.""I think there are the Adamses and the Roosevelts and the Kennedys. They are one of the three great political families in American history."" And part of that greatness, observers say, is the family's dedication to public service and kitchen-table issues that may be at the core of Obama's fit in the Kennedy brand. In the late 1980s, Obama was a community organizer on Chicago's South Side, advocating programs designed to help the poor and uninsured. That emphasis on community service, analysts say, is the bedrock of the Kennedy legacy. ""I have no doubt that wherever there is a Kennedy, they will be doing public service and they will be, I think, using their name -- the brand -- to help issues and causes that they care about,"" Hess said. Obama took that message to heart as he steered through an endless maze of legislation during his first couple of months in the White House. In late April, Obama signed a measure designed to strengthen national community service efforts by boosting federal funding for thousands of volunteers in fields ranging from clean energy to health care and education. The Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act, recently renamed to honor the Massachusetts senator's sponsorship, will more than triple the number of positions in the AmeriCorps program, from 75,000 to 250,000, by 2017. But Obama meets the Kennedy standard not only in substance; he also has its style and public appeal. In 1961, Time magazine named JFK man of the year, after a tough election battle with GOP candidate Richard Nixon. The article read: ""The closeness of his victory did not disturb him; he took over the office with a youth-can-do-anything sort of self-confidence. He learned better; but learn he did. And in so doing,"" the article says, he made 1961 ""the most endlessly interesting and exciting presidential year within recent memory."" Ted Sorensen, a former special counsel and adviser to President Kennedy, says there's no question about the similarities between the two. ""Both of them were compassionate and cared about the people at the bottom of the economic pyramid. ... Both Kennedy and Obama, by spending time abroad during their youth ... gave both of them a very good perspective of Americans' role in the world. ... Both of them were innovators."" And it's with those characteristics that Sorensen says Obama has lined himself up with the ideals of the Kennedy clan and has become a ""natural fit."" Both Obama and Kennedy ""reached out to young people; tried to get them involved in politics and government after a period of cynical indifference on the part of young people,"" Sorensen said. ""Both Kennedy and Obama ... were idealists ... and paid less attention to the old politics and won by paying attention to the new politics.""","Sen.

"BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- She was called ""the littlest refusenik,"" one of the many Soviet Jews denied permission to leave the Soviet Union because her father had been exposed to government secrets. But the case of Jessica Katz was special because she was a baby born with a nutritional deficiency that stopped her from growing. She was a tiny baby dying in a Moscow hospital, getting weaker by the day. It was U.S. Sen. Ted Kennedy who, her parents say, eventually saved her life. Jessica was born in Moscow in 1977 with malabsorption syndrome, which prevented her from digesting food or milk properly. All she needed was baby formula, but it wasn't available in the Soviet Union. The Soviet doctors couldn't save her. Jessica's parents, Boris and Natalya, were desperate. Jessica's grandmother had immigrated to Boston, Massachusetts, with two of her sons and was campaigning to get her baby granddaughter out of the Soviet Union. At first she helped urge American tourists to take baby formula to Moscow for the Katz family, and for a little while, it worked. It seemed to bring Jessica back from the brink.  Watch more of the story of ""the littlest refusenik"" Â» . But it wasn't enough. The Katz family knew they needed a permanent solution -- access to doctors in the West. Eventually, the grandmother's campaign reached Kennedy's office, and the senator decided to step in. In September 1978, Kennedy traveled to Moscow for a meeting with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev to urge him to let the Katz family -- or at the very least, Jessica -- leave the country immediately. ""If not for his intervention, I would have been arrested very soon [afterward] and it would have been too late for him to intervene,"" said Katz, recalling the fate of many of his Jewish friends. ""So he saved Jessica, he saved me, he saved the rest our family."" The first the Katzes knew of it was late one night when they got a mysterious phone call. The caller invited Boris Katz to a midnight meeting with an unnamed guest -- and in Soviet Russia, Katz didn't dare ask who it was. ""You know in the Soviet Union not to ask too many questions over the phone,"" he said. Katz arrived at the meeting and, much to his shock, in walked Kennedy. ""A bunch of KGB men came with him into the room and he just turned around and told the KGB men, 'Go away,'"" Katz recalled. ""This was clearly the first [time] ever I witnessed something like this. Here the all-powerful KGB men wanted to be at the meeting and the senator just told them to go away, and they looked at each other and just left. And that was, again, a powerful scene."" Kennedy spoke to other refuseniks already gathered in the room before pulling Katz aside. ""He said that earlier he had a meeting in the Kremlin with the Soviet leaders and that he specifically asked to allow us to leave the country for medical reasons,"" Katz said. ""He said that they said yes."" At first, Katz said, he didn't believe him, sure that the Soviet authorities would find a way to scupper the plans. Katz went home and told his wife, who also didn't believe it, he said. The next morning, a friend called Katz to say he heard Kennedy on the Voice of America radio network listing the names of people leaving the Soviet Union. The Katz family was on the list, the friend said. Despite the report, however, the Soviet authorities denied it, Katz recalls. ""'We are telling you that this is not the case,'"" he remembers them saying. ""But this was just part of the game that they played."" About three weeks later, with no fanfare, a card arrived in the mail telling the Katz family to pick up their visa. They now had their ticket out of the country. The exit wasn't straightforward -- the Katzes' second daughter, Gabriella, was born two days before they were due to leave, so they postponed their exit by five days. And they had to stop over in Vienna, Austria, where they were met by a Kennedy aide for the final leg of their trip. On landing in Boston, Kennedy was the first person they met. They gave each other a big hug, Katz said. ""Jessica certainly would not have made it if not for his contribution, if not for him taking on the case, getting interested in the case, patiently talking to the Soviet authorities,"" Katz told CNN. ""It was lucky for us. It saved the baby's life and created new life for Natalya and me and our children."" Kennedy's help for the family didn't end there. He helped Boris Katz, who had worked with computers, find a job at a computer software company. Today, Katz works at the renowned Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he is the principal research scientist at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. ""He did it because he wanted to help,"" Katz told CNN. ""I think that is what he does -- did -- for many other people. I went to a number of events where other people whom he helped gave various speeches and I learned many more cases [where] he helped people because he likes to help people. It is his job to help people."" Today, little Jessica Katz is 31 years old. She got engaged last year, on the same weekend Kennedy's cancer diagnosis was announced to the public. Inspired by Kennedy's life of public service, Jessica Katz works at finding housing for the homeless in New York City. She says she has no choice but to look after those less fortunate than she is, because Kennedy proved to her how much it means, and that it can work. Jessica Katz lacks the cynicism about the government that many others in her generation may have. Kennedy, she said, proved that some politicians have a desire to accomplish good things and fight injustice. ""He saved my life. He could have spent his time doing anything,"" Jessica Katz said. ""He's from the fanciest, most powerful family in Massachusetts, and probably in the country, and he decided to spend his time helping out me and my family."" That has instilled in her a deep sense of public service, she said. And that may be the best thing Kennedy has left behind. ""That that would be his largest, biggest part of his legacy -- as someone who cared deeply about people, who felt, I think, very deeply people's suffering and wanted to alleviate it and wanted to help,"" Jessica Katz said. ""And I am pretty confident that this is how he will be remembered. He was an extraordinary individual and this is how he will stay, certainly in our memories and the memories of millions of others.""","Jessica Katz was born with nutritional deficiency that stopped her from growing .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Her name is Butterfly. Butterfly Boucher relies on encouragement from fans to fuel her determination. Really. ""It's my real name,"" the singer-songwriter said. ""It's on my passport and everything. The first question [people usually ask] is, 'Is that your real name?' The second question is, 'Were your parents hippies?' "" Well? ""They were kind of hippies. They were just very creative types."" Born in Adelaide, Australia, Butterfly Boucher (rhymes with ""voucher"") is the middle of seven sisters and spent much of her childhood moving cities with her family in a motor home. And yes, some of her siblings have equally free-spirited names. ""My eldest sister, Rebecca, came home crying after her first day of school because there were two other Rebeccas in the class,"" she said. ""So at that point, Mom and Dad were like, 'OK, next time we're going to come up with something really original.' So the next sister was Sunshine -- I think that's more hippie than Butterfly -- and then me and then Eden, Angel and Harmony."" Although she's happy to hear you say her name is a little quirky, the 29-year-old may cringe if you label her music as such. Boucher released her debut album, ""Another White Dash,"" on A&M Records in 2003 but says she was given the runaround when it came to her sophomore release. ""They say [my music] is too quirky. They always say it's too pop for the indie scene and too indie for the pop scene.""  Watch (and listen) to some of Boucher's sounds Â» . After parting ways with her record label and having been allowed to keep the masters of her newer work, Boucher is going the independent route and will release the album June 2 on her own imprint. Called ""Scary Fragile,"" Boucher says, it was completed more than three years ago. She's determined to get it out there in spite of the challenges that come with being a DIY artist. ""The funding is my bank account, and it's not a very big bank account,"" she said. ""But I love working, and I work hard. It's a lot easier to work hard when there's a vision and there's a good group of people behind you."" Constant encouragement from fans -- via her MySpace and Facebook pages -- has fueled her determination. She's also gotten some breaks: ""Grey's Anatomy"" has used several of Boucher's songs. She performed as the opening act on Sarah McLachlan's ""Afterglow"" tour, and she shared the vocal work with David Bowie on a cover of his hit song ""Changes"" for the ""Shrek 2"" movie soundtrack. And in a show of support, fellow Aussie Nicole Kidman recently showed up at one of Boucher's gigs in Nashville, Tennessee, where Boucher now lives. Currently on a mini tour of the United States, Butterfly Boucher fluttered (sorry) into CNN this week to talk about heartache, grand pianos and nicknames. CNN: What has it been like growing up with a name like Butterfly? Do you feel like you've grown into that name? Butterfly Boucher: It does, yeah. I'm out of the cocoon, definitely, and I'm glad! I do I feel like I've had to grow into the name. Occasionally ... I catch it and I'm like, ""Butterfly! That's ridiculous! What kind of a name is that?"" Actually most of my friends call me Butter or Butters. CNN: How was music a part of your upbringing in Australia? Boucher: It was a huge part of my life growing up. My dad was a musician; he was a rock 'n' roller-songwriter kind of guy. So it's definitely in my blood. I ... remember lying under a grand piano and just listening to [my dad and his friends] record in the other room and just loving this big black shiny piano, just the whole concept of music. I was in dreamland. CNN: One of the standout lines from this past season of ""American Idol"" was when the judge Kara DioGuardi said the music business is paved with heartache. Do you agree with that sentiment? Boucher: Absolutely. ... Artists tend to be kind of emotional people. If it's good art, it should come from your soul, and it's coming from an emotional part of you. So it is very hard. Over the years, I've learned to balance the business side with the passionate artist side, because you just get too hurt. You take everything too personally, and sometimes you've got to make decisions that you're going to compromise things. I get depressed, but then you've gotta get through it. The things that get you through are my fans and the whole generation of MySpace and Facebook. Every day I'm getting just little comments like ""your music means so much to me."" Every day I get that, so it's a constant encouragement from fans and new people that are discovering you. I have got it pretty good. CNN: Why did you call your album ""Scary Fragile?"" Boucher: It was just a song title of one of the songs. ... There was no real deep reason behind it. I just liked that song, and I thought none of the other song titles sounded like an album. For a while I was calling it ""Just Because,"" and that was kind of lame. I don't want to be too deep with my album titles. I just want it to be catchy and something that you'll remember and then let the music and the lyrics do the rest of it. CNN: How do you like living in Nashville? Boucher: Ah, Nashville! I've been there for about 10 years. In the last few years, it's changed a lot. There are a lot of new people coming in. It helps that people like Jack White are embracing it, and Sheryl Crow. There are so many artists that secretly have a place there. And it's just this great music city. There are more venues, more coffee shops. There are new collaborations, and everybody's idea of what a good song is is changing, which I think is healthy for Nashville. I love it. CNN: What do you miss most about Australia? Boucher: The meat pies! I always crave meat pies. Sometimes I miss the smell of Australia. Although if you go to L.A. you can get it because they have a lot of eucalyptus trees there. So when it rains, it smells a bit like Australia.","Butterfly Boucher's new album, ""Scary Fragile,"" due out June 2 .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Taking Back Sunday is recharged. Taking Back Sunday's new album, ""New Again,"" came out last week. Having taken a long break between albums -- it's been three years since the last set, ""Louder Now"" -- the Long Island, New York, rock band is signaling a fresh outlook with its fourth album. Out last week, it's called ""New Again."" Scan the quintet's twenty-something faces and you'll notice that something is indeed new: the addition of guitarist Matt Fazzi. ""With that break and bringing Fazzi into the band it's almost like [there's] a flame that's been rekindled or a spark just got brighter,"" said lead singer Adam Lazzara.  Watch Taking Back Sunday run amok Â» . Led by the thrashing single ""Sink Into Me"" (the music video has the band slowly, messily disappearing into a sinkhole), the album just debuted at No. 7 on the Billboard 200 chart. CNN caught up with Taking Back Sunday at a magazine photo shoot in Los Angeles where the band shared stories about striking poses and striking each other. CNN: How do you feel about all that nonmusical stuff like posing for photos, makeup ... ? Adam Lazzara: It's something over the years we've had to become very comfortable with. I think we're getting pretty good at it. Matt Rubano: We try to approach everything with our way of doing things and our sense of humor so that it's not uncomfortable. Lazzara: And I've seen ""Zoolander"" enough times ... Rubano: That's the bible. ""Zoolander"" and Tyra [Banks]. We kind of split it up between those two things. I've learned everything that I know about posing from Tyra. So thank you Miss Banks. I can smile with my eyes like Tyra does. CNN: Tell me about the single [""Sink Into Me""]. Lazzara: Through all the songs on the record it's the one that came about the most organically. Fazzi just started playing the main riff in the song and then Mark came in on the drums and then 15 minutes later we have a tune. Rubano: It also has the frenetic energy that we've always been known for, so it was kind of like an obvious choice to represent the new record. CNN: Some might say that you've taken your music in a more melodic direction on this album. Do you agree with that? Rubano: I think we've always taken steps forward when it comes time to make a record. Lazzara: Yeah, you can't be standing in still water. Rubano: We consider our band a living thing, so the new musical territory that we went into on this record is what keeps us excited and what naturally and organically came out of us. Yeah, there's more vocal harmonies, there's more emphasis on trying to stay focused on writing a great song and that's what a lot of the artists that influence us do. CNN: What do you like most about being in a rock band? Lazzara: There are very few things I don't like about being in a rock band. Ever since I was a little kid this was always something that I would love to be doing but never thought was really possible. We're living the dream. Rubano: We tour a lot so we miss birthdays and holidays and our wives and girlfriends and puppies and children and fish. Lazzara: I don't think any one of us have fish. Rubano: Strike the fish. We miss all the other things. But you kind of learn to adapt and that's a little bit of the sacrifice. But we've been to Japan and Australia and places that as a dishwasher or a waiter I really wasn't on track to going to see. Music has brought us around the world, which is unbelievable. CNN: Adam, what's the most ridiculous thing you've done on stage? Lazzara: There's a very long list. I dislocated my hip once. That was pretty ridiculous and painful at the same time. Rubano: You almost broke my skull. Lazzara: I knocked him out cold one time in front of 15,000 people. It's nothing I'm proud of. It's funny now. But it wasn't so much then. ... [When I started singing with the band] I just started throwing the microphone around. ... The bigger the stage the more comfortable I would get with it and just see how far I could throw. [One night,] first song ... I toss it. And then you just hear (makes thud sound). And I looked back and he was flat on his back bleeding profusely from his head. Not awesome. Rubano: Yeah. To your credit I wasn't really paying attention. And when you're in Taking Back Sunday, while you're performing you have to play your instrument and focus on the crowd and also make sure that you're not going to get decapitated. And I wasn't looking. ... I was just pouring blood from my face. And they rushed me off stage. And the band kept playing. Thanks, guys. Thanks for doing that. CNN: How difficult is it for you to all stay friends? Lazzara: Funny you should ask that. For a long time in the band I think there was a lot of animosity. ... But now after that little break and since we've been doing everything that we've been doing now with ""New Again"" coming out, I haven't started hating any of you guys yet. Rubano: Part of the symbolism behind ""New Again"" is not only musical, but definitely personal. Like we've spent more time together -- the five of us socially -- in the last year and a half than we ever have before that. It's really a trip when we feel like we're going through something like that, but when people that are watching the band feel like they can see the strength of those relationships and the fact that we're really enjoying ourselves, that really affirms that it's actually happening. I really love all these guys. Very much. Lazzara: Stop it. Rubano: Since Matt's joined the band he's become one of my closest friends ... and these guys I've known for years and years. And we've only gotten closer and more comfortable with each other. And it works musically tenfold better than it ever has. CNN: Do you want to have a big group hug or something? Lazzara: Let's do it (all five band members hug each other).","Taking Back Sunday's new album is ""New Again""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Rhett Miller, the Old 97's frontman, can be hard to get a fix on. Old 97's frontman Rhett Miller says that his solo albums keep him from going nuts. He's a rock 'n' roll musician, yet soft-spoken and mild-mannered. He's 38 years old, but looks 23. He once cut his hair really short in an attempt to make himself less attractive, but now wears his mane long and shaggy. And then there are his Twitter entries, which have a wit all their own. For example: ""Sometimes, sitting in a hot tub, I pretend that I'm in the kitchen of some giant who's making Rhett soup. And I just start screaming.""  Watch how Miller's kids react to his singing Â» . OK, maybe that's a little disturbing. But we are talking about a singer-songwriter whose imagination gets more than the average workout. Miller has been writing songs as the frontman for the alt-country band Old 97's for 16 years, and has also penned four solo albums.  Watch Miller play a song from his album Â» . In fact, the Old 97's -- which started as a bar band in Dallas, Texas -- has such an extensive catalogue that during a four-night run in Hoboken, New Jersey, in June, the band played original sets each night, with only the closing song repeated. Miller talked to CNN about his new, self-titled solo album -- hailed by Rolling Stone magazine as his strongest yet -- and why playing in front of his kids isn't necessarily great for his ego. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Is it difficult being both a solo artist and the front man for Old 97's? Rhett Miller: No. Without the solo career I wouldn't have an outlet for about half of my creative impulses and I'd go nuts. CNN: Do you consider yourself more rock 'n' roll than alt-country these days? Miller: Yeah. I love old-timey country and British pop and twee folk, but at heart I am a rock 'n' roller. Have you ever seen me bang my head? CNN: I'm curious to know why you would release a self-titled album four albums into your solo career. Rhett Miller: That is a weird thing, isn't it? I don't know ... the last two records, ""The Instigator"" and ""The Believer,"" I felt like I was writing from a bit of a remove. ... [This record] feels very honest and soul-bearing and vulnerable and all those things that are scary. And so it made sense to make it ""Rhett Miller."" And it's a fantastic name. It's worked really well for me so far. CNN: It is a cool name. Is it real? Miller: To an extent. My real name is Stewart Ransom Miller II. And my mom agreed to that name if I would be called Rhett. 'Cause all of the nicknames that come out of Stewart Ransom Miller II are not good. CNN: What's wrong with Stu? Miller: Stu, really? But then I'd be like meat stew. CNN: You were really torn up over the death of your hero, author David Foster Wallace. Did that influence this album at all? Miller: Yeah. Even though I think this record sounds very happy, there's some subtext of real despair on it. We all go through tough times. I dealt with a few different personal things and it seems I know a lot of people who are going through divorces. The world is going through an incredible economic crisis. And then David Foster Wallace goes and kills himself. And yeah, I think it shows up on the record. You probably have to listen to it a few times to really realize that that's happening and that's intentional ... because I don't really want people listening to the record crying. CNN: You have two little kids. How has being a father changed your approach to music? Miller: The weirdest thing about being a dad and still being a songwriter is the logistics of it. You know, finding a moment to write a song. The only thing I could figure out to do was sit in the middle of the madness, in the middle of the living room and with the chaos swirling all around me and just write a song there. They couldn't care less what I'm doing. Every once in a while they tell me to be quiet. Or they'll walk over and put their hands on the guitar strings and go ""Daddy, shhh."" CNN: You've been called a heartthrob. Is that a blessing or a curse? Miller: Ummm ... thank you, I guess, for the implied compliment. It's been a weird thing. When I started I was a teenager and I was opening for punk rock bands and I'd get written about in the paper in Dallas as ""pretty boy teen folkie"" or ""impish folkie."" It was always this diminutive, reductive thing that happened and so I rebelled against that. On the first Old 97's record -- maybe the first couple of records -- on the photos on the album you couldn't see me. Everybody else would be in focus and I would be blurry. I'd wear big civil engineer eye glasses, I got a buzz cut. I would intentionally try and make myself look as awful as I could. Fortunately I was still able to get girlfriends. But then at a certain point I thought, ""This is so stupid! Is this such a horrible thing?"" And so I got a Jon Bon Jovi haircut and started wearing nicer clothes, got Lasik. I don't know man, if that's the worst problem I've got then it's a pretty good life. CNN: Has Twitter made a big impact on the way musicians and fans relate? Miller: I don't know about all musicians, but I definitely enjoy the succinctness of the format and the immediate connection to the fans. CNN: What distinguishes an impressive tweet from an ordinary tweet? Miller: Humor. Wait, did you ask what I look for in a lady? CNN: If you weren't a musician, what might you be doing? Miller: Definitely not stand-up comedy. Maybe co-hosting a show on a cable news network?","Rhett Miller, frontman of Old 97's, has new solo album out .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The home life Diana Krall shares with husband (and fellow musical brain) Elvis Costello and their 2-year-old twin boys is a little nutty. Diana Krall's new album, ""Quiet Nights,"" was inspired by a trip she made to Brazil. ""It's zany in the most wonderful way,"" says the 44-year-old jazz singer-pianist. ""You have two little boys leaping off the furniture who think they're Buzz Lightyear while we're practicing and playing. It's just a happy house."" Krall's domestic bliss -- ""domestic"" being a new concept for the ever-touring artist -- is suggested in the warm, intimate vibe of her latest album ""Quiet Nights."" ""It's a very natural process for me, making a record. It ends up being a reflection of where I am at that time. My life is just tremendous right now. It couldn't be better,"" she says. No kidding. ""Quiet Nights"" debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 album charts last week, a career high for Krall. A memorable trip to Brazil in 2007 inspired the Canadian chanteuse to take her 12th album in a bossa nova direction: The title track is the English version of the bossa nova classic ""Corcovado."" She also covers ""The Girl from Ipanema"" -- though naturally in her whispery rendition she flips ""girl"" to ""boy"" -- and gives a fresh spin on Frank Sinatra's ""Where or When.""  Watch Krall find bliss in Brazil Â» . ""There was something about turning 'Where or When' into a bossa nova that changes the feeling for me of the song,"" Krall said. ""It's much more emotional than if I sang it in a swing feeling. I've always experimented with that."" Krall brought arranger and conductor Claus Ogerman on board. He was a natural, having worked with Sinatra and Brazilian singer-songwriter Antonio Carlos Jobim who wrote both ""Ipanema"" and ""Corcovado."" And Krall co-produced the album with frequent collaborator Tommy LiPuma. ""One of the best parts of making a record is the dinner after where you all you go to the restaurant, you decompress, have some great wine and just tell stories and listen to Claus and Tommy and [engineer] Al Schmidt and all these people telling amazing stories,"" says Krall. Diana Krall recently sat down with CNN to share some stories of her own about a teenaged letter to Oscar Peterson, idolizing Harry Connick Jr. and Mickey Mouse pancakes. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: This is the first album you've made since becoming a mother. Does it feel different somehow? Diana Krall: I think [this album reflects my present] state of mind. It's not about loss, it's not preparing for loss. I'm not peeling grapes. Life has changed a lot and it's not just about performing and touring. It's motherhood and having a home for the first time, because I've always been on the road. So it's an incredible thing to be making Mickey Mouse pancakes in the morning while you're doing your interviews. CNN: You've been producing Barbara Streisand's new album. What has that been like? Krall: Incredible. I just am so thrilled with her performance on this album. [She gives] one of the most incredible performances I think of her career on a song called ""You Must Believe in Spring"" with a great pianist from New York named Phil Charlap. It's just piano and voice and it's so incredibly stunning. She said to me, ""Maybe it needs some strings or something."" I said ""Don't touch it! Just leave it! It's gorgeous!"" It's been great working artist to artist and we had a lot of fun. We played cards. So when there were moments in the studio where there was something technical that had to be fixed, we'd deal the cards and we'd play gin rummy, which I'm lousy at. Thank goodness. CNN: This is the first album you've produced for another artist. Way to choose somebody really small to start off with. Krall: She chose me! I had a few phone calls and it was a little daunting, but it was a great experience and really, really intense, as you would expect it to be. CNN: Some people were a little put out by your record ""The Girl in the Other Room"" because you strayed from jazz. How did you process that reaction? Krall: Somebody's always put out with anything I do (laughs). ""Why'd you do 'The Look of Love?' "" ""Why don't you do 'The Look of Love' again?"" I don't know! I'm too busy trying to put the Lego back in the box, and making sure nobody's eating all the Play-Doh. That record did very well and a lot of people say to me, ""That's my favorite record."" And I wrote [it] with my husband, so I don't really look back. I look forward. And I've got a pretty loyal audience. CNN: What would you say to your sons if they tell you they want to be musicians when they grow up? Krall: They should do whatever makes them happy. This is what they know so if that's what they choose to do -- who knows. They could be like my mom and my dad and be a teacher-librarian and a chartered accountant. That's fine too. A month ago I found this letter I wrote to Oscar Peterson when I was 16 years old and my mom had saved it for me and put it in a box in the attic. It was a five-page letter I wrote to Oscar Peterson saying, ""Dear Oscar, I'm 16 years old and I hear a professional musician's life is a very difficult one but I know this is the only life I want to have."" And it was really enlightening for me to see the focus of a 16-year-old. It reminded me of how much I love the music and always wanted to do what I'm doing, so how lucky am I? CNN: But it's not all luck. Krall: I think it's a lot of luck. I think I started in a very good time. When I went to see that film ""When Harry Met Sally,"" and I heard Harry Connick playing the piano, I though there's somebody who's my age and he's playing the music that I love. And I felt like there was a kindred spirit and it inspired me to go, ""I want to do exactly what he's doing."" And I still owe a lot of thanks to Harry. I've only met him like a couple of times, but he's still a favorite artist of mine.","Diana Krall's new album, ""Quiet Nights,"" features bossa nova interpretations .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Madeleine Peyroux has carved out a successful career as an interpreter of songs from greats such as Billie Holiday, Patsy Cline and Leonard Cohen. But on her fourth album, the smoky-voiced singer holds the mirror up to herself. Madeleine Peyroux takes a clear-eyed look at her life and relationships on ""Bare Bones."" ""Bare Bones"" is Peyroux's first album for which she wrote or co-wrote all the tracks. And she doesn't shy away from touchy subjects. ""River of Tears"" was inspired by her difficult relationship with her late alcoholic father. ""I think it's the kind of feeling that you can get any time of your life when you just have to face some things,"" she says about getting personal. ""You have to let it all hang out, let go of the ideas that were more comfortable and embrace some of the sadness in your life. And then perhaps let it float.""  Watch Peyroux get personal Â» . Born in Athens, Georgia, Peyroux (pronounced ""Peru"") spent some time in a domestic violence shelter as a child. After her parents' divorce, she moved to Paris with her mother which is where, as a teenager, she tested her mettle as a performer by busking on the streets. Critics responded favorably to Peyroux's 1996 debut album, ""Dreamland,"" and international recognition followed with 2004's million-selling ""Careless Love."" While Peyroux prefers to keep a fairly low profile, she took the time to talk to CNN about stripping down to the bare bones on her newest album. CNN: This is the first album where you've written or co-written all the material. What was that like? Madeleine Peyroux: I was just excited about it. Every day was another opportunity to keep writing for this record, so I spent a year and a half co-writing with a lot of other people as well so that I could go through different processes and get the songs written. Now I'm singing these songs and I feel that looking back ... it was time really well spent. CNN: Was there apprehension about revealing too much about yourself? Peyroux: No. I think of the things that I wrote on this record as stories of being a young woman walking the streets of Paris late at night in ""Our Lady of Pigalle,"" or trying to touch on the Southern culture of drinking and surviving on the basic sayings that we have in order to understand what life is all about. ... But the question was ... would anybody want me to actually tell the full story from beginning to end and make sense of it? Because in the end, I'd like these songs to make sense to everyone and not just be my story. CNN: Tell us about the song ""River of Tears."" Peyroux: My producer, Larry Klein, had the idea. He wrote the lyrics at the beginning of the song because he had been working with me during the time my father passed away and he knew the story. ... He wrote, ""Stop all this talk, turn off the telephone. Open up another bottle. I'm gonna float down this river of tears."" We kept writing it together. CNN: What was your relationship like with your dad? Peyroux: Complex. ... He was a complex character. He's definitely a big part of the material on this record. CNN: The album ends on a very uplifting note with the song ""Something Grand"" and the line ""all's forgiven."" Is it true that song was inspired by President Obama? Peyroux: It was. ... I live in Brooklyn, New York, and I was up at 4 a.m., the quietest hour, where the highway just slows down for about five minutes so you don't hear any trucks banging over the potholes. I had the windows open. The debates [had been] on television. It was an exciting feeling, and we knew that there was a change coming. And I needed to know that in my bones, and I wanted to feel it. Luck would have it that Obama was elected the day that I recorded the vocals on that song. CNN: What is it about early female blues singers that captivate you? Peyroux: I think I was probably an early teenager when I discovered Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey and a bunch of people that are on a long list of artists. They were important to me, especially as an early adolescent. ... To have a female role model that first of all touches me personally and deeply. ... They were very strong women. Bessie Smith, for example, created her own life. She ran the show, she owned a railway train. CNN: You've had a tough life so far, haven't you? Peyroux: Tumultuous. I think eventful ... with traveling and going through a lot of changes in my household, my family, moving around quite a bit. But [I've had] a lot of luck, you know. So not as tough as just a little crazy. ... Music was a big part of [my luck]. And it has the power to change a lot of people from being jaded and take them back into something soothing and healing.","Madeleine Peyroux's new album, ""Bare Bones,"" is unflinching .

"Washington (CNN) -- Some foreign students who enroll and graduate from U.S. flight schools are in the U.S. illegally, despite extensive post-9/11 efforts to vet student pilots, congressional investigators said Wednesday. Stephen Lord, an investigative chief with the Government Accountability Office, declined to say how many student pilots he found to be wrongly in the country, saying that the Transportation Security Administration had deemed the number to be ""sensitive security information."" But, he said, his study showed ""weaknesses"" in the TSA's vetting process that need to be fixed. The holes are ""extremely disturbing,"" House Homeland Security subcommittee Chairman Rep. Mike Rogers said. ""It's completely unacceptable that a decade after 9/11 GAO has uncovered weaknesses in our security controls that were supposed to be fixed a decade ago,"" Rogers said. Several of the terrorists who carried out the attacks of September 11, 2001, including leader Mohammed Atta, trained at U.S. flight schools before conducting their attack, and government leaders vowed to prevent such a mistake from happening again. For illegal immigrant graduates, a 'leap of faith' answered . Today, the TSA vets foreign student pilots against terror watch lists and conducts fingerprint-based criminal background checks, but it does not vet them against immigration databases, the GAO lead investigator said. Lord said his group downloaded an FAA database of pilots and compared it to TSA's database of student pilots who had completed background checks. ""In a perfect world, the two databases would match,"" Lord said. ""But we were surprised to find that some ... of the foreign nationals holding pilots' licenses were not in the TSA's databases, indicating that some foreign nationals had not been vetted before receiving flight training, and ultimately receiving pilots' licenses."" The hole first came to public light in 2010 when local police stopped the owner of a Massachusetts flight school for a traffic violation and discovered he was in the country illegally. Federal immigration officials investigated and found that 25 of the foreign nationals at the school had been vetted by the TSA and had been approved to begin flight training. But further investigation revealed that eight of the students had entered the country illegally and 17 had overstayed their visas. Kerwin Wilson, the TSA's general manager for general aviation, said the TSA is taking steps to address the matter. ""We do have a plan in place. We're working very closely with ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) in terms of automating the process to ensure that TSA is also checking for immigration status as well as the Terrorist Screening database,"" he said. Rep. Chip Cravaak, R-Minnesota, said the government needs a ""common-sense solution"" to prevent another 9/11-style attack, but said no solution would be perfect. ""We will never have 100 percent security. That just won't happen. Somebody that is perfectly normal one day can flip, because of whatever pressures he or she is under,"" he said.","GAO chief investigator says he found ""weaknesses"" in the TSA's vetting process .

"(CNN) -- San Francisco Giants pitcher Matt Cain threw a perfect game Wednesday night in a 10-0 victory against the Houston Astros, the first pitcher to achieve that feat in Giants history. ""This is unbelievable,"" Cain told reporters after the game. ""This is part of history. Something I am going to remember forever and ever."" Cain's perfect game is the 22nd in Major League Baseball history and he accomplished it with style, striking out 14 batters. Cain is the second pitcher this year to pitch a perfect game; Chicago White Sox right-hander Philip Humber also threw a perfect game on April 21. SI: Cain's perfect game much more than just latest pitching gem . The early part of the game featured little drama as Cain dominated Astros hitters, and did not come close to giving up a hit. But in the seventh inning, Giants outfielder Gregor Blanco saved the perfect game by chasing down a screaming drive hit by the Astros Jordan Schafer and making a diving catch on the warning track. The dazzling catch also put Blanco in the spotlight as his name was trending on Twitter nationwide along with Matt Cain's some 20 minutes after the game. Cain's feat comes the same night that New York Mets pitcher R.A. Dickey narrowly missed a no hitter. Dickey held the Tampa Bay Rays to only one infield hit Wednesday night, and did not walk a batter. There have now been five no hitters this year. Along with Cain and Humber, Jered Weaver, Johan Santana and a crew of Seattle Mariners also pitched games without allowing a hit.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- While shoulder pads and big hair are no longer part of the Bangles' repertoire, those glorious harmonies remain. The Bangles just started on a new CD and have stayed active by touring. The '80s band (whose members aren't entirely sold on that description) recently powered through a set at Sirus XM Radio's New York headquarters as part of the company's ""Artist Confidential"" series. An audience of happy fans watched from outside a studio as Susanna Hoffs and sisters Vicki and Debbi Peterson attempted to rattle the glass walls with the melodious ""Manic Monday"" and an electric ""Hazy Shade of Winter."" The Bangles broke up at the end of the decade, after also having hits with ""Eternal Flame"" and ""Walk Like an Egyptian,"" but re-formed in 2000. In 2003, they released the album ""Doll Revolution."" They've just started on a new CD. These days, there are only three members; bassist Michael Steele left the group in 2005.  Watch the group draw the line at walking like an Egyptian Â» . Hoffs, now 50 but looking nowhere near it, celebrates the release of a side project next month: a collection of '70s covers with musician Matthew Sweet called ""Under The Covers Vol. 2."" The Bangles talked to CNN about fine wine, being horrified by the decade that made them and stumbling across embarrassing photos on the Web. CNN: What's it like performing together now? Is it easier or more enjoyable than it was in the '80s? Susanna Hoffs: For me, it is. One nice thing about getting older is that we're better musicians, and we play better. Vicki Peterson: And slightly more relaxed as humans. And maybe we have a little more perspective. Hoffs: That fine wine mellowing. (It) has happened to us as well. Vicki Peterson: Yes, the drinking of the fine wine, not the being of the fine wine. Debbi Peterson: We've mellowed out, man. CNN: Well, that's kind of boring, isn't it? Hoffs: Don't worry. We still have our edgy moments. CNN: Now that you all have families, how do you juggle recording an album and going on the road? Hoffs: There's a lot of text messaging. It's mostly scheduling. It's crazy how busy we are. But it's OK. It's just juggling. It's like any working mother. CNN: How's the new album coming along? Vicki Peterson: We just sort of started it, scratched the surface. ... We've been having a good time, and we're experimenting with technology. Both Susanna and I have studios in our home, so that's going to open up our scheduling a little bit. We're also recording as we write, which we've never done before. So it's an interesting process. CNN: Do you have a deadline? Hoffs: No. No record label, no deadline. And that's kind of what's fun about it. Vicki Peterson: No one breathing down our necks. Hopefully we get it done. Because normally we need deadlines or we don't do anything. CNN: Why do you think people are still so fascinated with the '80s? Hoffs: I've been thinking about that a lot lately. Because during the '80s, we were sort of horrified by the '80s! No, not horrified ... but we were shocked by how silly a lot of it was. And kitsch. Debbi Peterson: And big hair. Vicki Peterson: And not in synch with our own time. Hoffs: We were little girls who grew up being obsessed with all things '60s, because to us, the '60s was like the Renaissance. It was like the golden age of culture, art and music, films and fashion. I think there's an aspect to the '80s that no matter what you think about it, it was just silly and fun and lighthearted. There wasn't a lot of protest music going on. There wasn't a lot of super-meaningful stuff, except there was great indie rock that came out of the '80s. It was just fun. CNN: But ultimately, you don't identify yourselves as an '80s band, do you? Vicki Peterson: No, we don't. Even in the '80s, we felt a little out of our element. Hoffs: And yet I wore the terrible shoulder pads. Debbi Peterson: We're all guilty of that one. Hoffs: Why did I do that? CNN: Do you often look back at old photos? Hoffs: The problem is the Internet. Everything's on there now. It's inescapable. Vicki Peterson: Everything lives forever. CNN: Do you self-Google just to torture yourselves? Debbi Peterson: Never. Vicki Peterson: (jokingly) That's a rather personal question, isn't it? Hoffs: I've been known to do it, just to kind of see what's out there, and it's a very dangerous, slippery slope. One should not do it too often. Vicki Peterson: I wouldn't recommend it. CNN: What do you think about social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter and MySpace? Hoffs: I think if it's not twitter-lating, then one must not spend too much time doing it. Twittering. I can't go down that path yet. ... Vicki Peterson: Tweeting actually is the verb. One tweets. Hoffs: I know, but I've created the new ""twitter-lating."" It's my own personal statement on it. It's just too many things to keep track of. And it's too many things that are about the moment. Vicki Peterson: There's a complete lack of the inner critic, a complete lack of editing. Everything is out there all the time. There's no mystery. I don't think I want the world to know my innermost thoughts. CNN: Are there any girl bands out there that impress you? Vicki Peterson: It's a rare breed still for whatever reason. Antigone Rising opened for us here in New York. They were wonderful. Debbi Peterson: The Donnas. Hoffs: People don't realize how awesome it is and how fun it is, having the camaraderie with other women. Women get together and do other things. Why not play music together? There's a certain something about it that's very compelling. CNN: Take me back to the moment when you decided to reunite. Vicki Peterson: It was a long, drawn-out moment. It lasted about three years. Hoffs: I was the instigator. You guys would admit that, too. Vicki Peterson: Absolutely. At ever-increasingly close intervals, she would call. Eventually, we did all get on the phone together and decide that the idea was a good one. We were all making music with other people, and there is a certain magic to the Bangles when we sing together. Debbi Peterson: The voices. Vicki Peterson: And the writing. I missed the writing partnership.","The Bangles were '80s hitmakers with ""Walk Like an Egyptian,"" ""Eternal Flame""

"(CNN) -- As Russ Berkman understood it, desperate times call for desperate measures. And when your Swiss mountain dog gobbles up your Masters tickets, that means getting out the hydrogen peroxide and getting ready to sift through your canine's vomit. That's the choice the Seattle resident made after a fit of panic when he realized Saturday night that his beloved canine Sierra had eaten his and his friends' four passes to the prestigious Augusta, Georgia, golf tournament. Augusta beyond that exclusive golf club . ""Laying on the hardwood floor was just the strings from (the tickets)"" as he came in from a short trip outside, Berkman recalled. ""I knew."" With just a few hours to go before he boarded his 6 a.m. Sunday flight east, he called his girlfriend, who recommended he give Sierra some low-concentration hydrogen peroxide solution, which many recognize as a safe way to get a dog to vomit. Thankfully, it was late in the day and Sierra hadn't eaten much recently. So when she threw up, the result was ""not as bad as you'd think,"" Berkman said on Thursday. Still, the tickets were far from whole and far from pristine. Berkman was able to cobble together the tickets into something resembling the four passes he'd received after the annual Masters ticket lottery in August. So Berkman took off, holding the stitched together passes close to the vest. He also kept from his three buddies the news that his dog had eaten their perhaps once-in-a-lifetime chance to traverse the greens of Augusta National Golf Club. The Masters by numbers . The foursome had been planning the trip for months, and Berkman said he didn't want to let his friends down (until, God forbid, he had no other choice). So after a traveling day on Sunday, the friends played golf for 36 holes in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. The fact Berkman kept darting away for surreptitious phone calls was perhaps the only clue that something was awry. Equipped with what was left of the tickets, pictures of the originals and an e-mail verification of his purchase, he called Augusta's ticket office on Monday morning in hopes they'd be ""gracious Southern folks"" and let him and his friends attend the event. ""About 10 minutes later, they called back and asked if I was the one with the hungry dog,"" Berkman told HLN. ""And I said, 'Indeed I am.'"" Two days later, he and his since-informed friends picked up their reprinted tickets and watched the final practice round for the Masters -- an experience Berkman described as ""incredible,"" even after inclement weather shortened their stay. Photos: Masters, Round 1 . By Thursday, he was back home in Washington with Sierra healthy and happy by his side. ""She's just fine,"" Berkman said.

"(CNN) -- More than 30 years ago, 6-year-old Etan Patz vanished from a Manhattan street on his way to a school bus stop. His parents never saw him again. The case riveted millions. It also changed the country. Patz investigation a 33-year-long roller-coaster ride . ""It awakened America,"" Ernie Allen, president and chief executive officer of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, recently told CNN. ""It was the beginning of a missing children's movement."" Thursday, Pedro Hernandez, a former Manhattan stock clerk who once lived in the same neighborhood as Etan, was arrested in connection with his death. The Patz case was the first of several high-profile cases that catapulted concern about missing children to the forefront of national consciousness. Basement search for Etan Patz clues ends . Just weeks after Etan disappeared in May 1979, an attacker abducted the first of more than 20 children to be kidnapped and killed in Atlanta, stirring fear until police arrested a suspect two years later. In another case that made headlines, in 1981 someone abducted 6-year-old Adam Walsh from a Florida shopping mall and killed him. The cases received increasing news coverage in a fast-changing landscape that saw a proliferation of media outlets with growing interest in compelling visual images -- such as a heart-rending photo of a smiling child or video of parents pleading for their child's safe return. Overheard on CNN: Face on milk carton chipped away at our innocence . The actual number of children who were kidnapped and killed did not change -- it's always been a relatively small number -- but awareness of the cases skyrocketed, experts said in recent interviews that shed light on the issue of missing children. ""Interest in the situation exploded,"" said Marc Klaas, whose 12-year-old daughter, Polly, was kidnapped and strangled to death in a 1993 case that also received intense news coverage. ""It really pulled the lid off of America's dirty little secret, the fact that children are being victimized in large numbers,"" he told CNN in April. The cases also stoked fear, sparked awareness and prompted change from politicians and police. In 1984, Congress passed the Missing Children's Assistance Act. That led to the creation of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. President Ronald Reagan opened the center in a White House ceremony in 1984. It soon began operating a 24-hour toll-free hotline on which callers could report information about missing boys and girls. Police officers also started to respond more quickly to reports of missing children, experts said. After Etan disappeared, investigators tried what was then a novel technique to try to find him: They put his face on thousands of milk cartons, a technique that would become more common in the next few years. Relatives and authorities also put the images of missing children on billboards and fliers distributed by mail. Those more assertive efforts eventually led to the AMBER alert system, which broadcasts news about missing children on TV, radio, the Internet, mobile phones, lottery tickets and highway signs. That system has helped save 554 children, the federal government says. Most of them were recovered after the first-ever White House Conference on Missing, Exploited and Runaway Children in 2002. Before the dramatic increase in awareness of crimes against children in the 1980s, only a few high-profile cases grabbed the public's attention. Klaas points out that in 1873, after a 4-year-old Philadelphia boy named Charley Ross disappeared, authorities produced the first missing-child flier. The 1932 disappearance and killing of Charles Lindbergh Jr., the 20-month-old son of the world-famous aviator, attracted worldwide attention. It resulted in the Lindbergh Law, which permitted federal authorities to chase kidnappers across state lines. Even before the Etan Patz case, groups were working in the 1970s -- largely out of the spotlight -- on the issue of missing children. They advocated tougher rules in cases of children who were abducted by relatives, said Joel Best, a professor of sociology and criminal justice at the University of Delaware. Children abducted by relatives, runaways, and abductions by strangers are the three classifications of what came to be repackaged and rebranded by activists as ""missing children"" in the late 1970s and early 1980s, he said. ""The missing children's movement was the outgrowth of an earlier child-snatching movement,"" Best said. Runaways comprise the largest number of the missing children, he said, and while there are few abductions by strangers, those ""emotional, wrenching stories"" make an impact. Best spoke last month, after police dug up parts of a basement in an unsuccessful attempt to crack the case. So did Lisa Cohen, author of ""After Etan: The Missing Child Case that Held America Captive."" She said the Etan Patz case galvanized media-saturated New York. So did his photo, which Cohen called a ""beautiful"" shot made by his photographer father, Stan. ""A picture is worth a thousand words,"" she said. Cohen said people empathized with the angst of Stan and his wife Julie -- seen by TV viewers and newspapers readers as normal, intelligent and wise people. The case never ended, the story was never over, and the news outlets never stopped covering it. ""It started a ball rolling,"" she said. ""There was a real momentum."" Barbara Friedman, associate professor of University of North Carolina's School of Journalism and Mass Communication, has said such ""heinous crimes are always newsworthy"" and ""have been reported in the press for as long as there has been a press."" ""As media became more plentiful and visual in the 1980s, child abductions and child murders allowed for the kinds of images that are at once intimate and universal -- like school photos and grieving families,"" Friedman said. ""The use of milk cartons as another form of media to locate missing children was a way to bring the issue into the family space -- the breakfast table -- heightening awareness as well as anxieties."" Etan's family and Adam Walsh's parents have been particularly media savvy, she said, as they kept their cases front and center before the public and law enforcement. ""They were strategically and actively engaged in cultivating their attention. And in the age of the 24-hour news cycle, there were more reporters looking for substantive news stories and more space to fill,"" she said. The case raised consciousness but also stirred fear. ""I think it ended an era of innocence in this country,"" Allen said. ""Parents around the nation saw how it happened and thought, 'But for the grace of God, my child.' ""","NEW: New York police say a man has been arrested in the death of Etan Patz .

"(CNN) -- Dani Pedrosa took his first Moto GP win of the season after teammate Casey Stoner crashed on the final lap at the German MotoGP. Defending world champion Stoner was battling with his Repsol Honda colleague Pedrosa at the Sachsenring before sliding off his bike prior to the final few corners. The Australian's error handed Jorge Lorenzo second place and means he now leads the world championship standings by 16 points from Pedrosa. Stoner slipped to third and was distraught to have thrown away a winning position. He told the BBC: ""I'm pretty disappointed, I had planned to go for my 'win or bin' effort in the last corner not that one! ""I felt confident but as soon as I tried to turn in a little more, the front went. I was already off the brakes and not in the hard braking area, as soon as I eased of the brakes I guess the weight came off the front and down I went. ""I'm frustrated I wasn't allowed to get up and try and score some points, the bike was perfect, but the marshals pushed me away. ""If we can continue this momentum for the rest of the season then we shouldn't be so worried for the championship."" It was Pedrosa's third consecutive German MotoGP victory and he was quickest off the blocks, beating Stoner, who started on pole, to the first corner from third spot. Stoner did reclaim the lead by the end of the opening lap and as the race went on, the pair pulled away from Lorenzo who was a full eight seconds back. But Stoner lost his front wheel going into to one of the final turns and ended up unhurt on the gravel, ensuring a smooth last few corners for Pedrosa. After the race the Spaniard told reporters: ""At the start I wasn't comfortable because of changes to my bike. As I became used to all the changes I passed Casey, and was feeling good. ""Towards the end I had to fight for the win, on the last lap I was racing at my maximum."" The next race on the MotoGP calendar takes place in Italy on July 15. MotoGP standings: . 1.

"(CNN) -- Greece's elections this weekend could trigger the country's exit from the euro -- but even that might not save Europe from splintering, the head of insurance giant AXA has warned. Henri de Castries told CNN ""a Greek exit won't solve everything,"" adding the problems in Europe are ""more complex than that."" De Castries, a fan of Greek mythology, believes a Greek exit would be akin to opening a Pandora's box. ""Opening the box is very tempting before and very disastrous afterwards,"" he said. De Castries said there were ""flaws"" in the construction of the euro which have created the cracks. ""It was a case of putting the cart before the horse,"" he said. ""Economic policies were not converging enough and the disciplines were not strong enough to allow for a stable position in the long run."" The worst-case scenario, according to de Castries, would be a disorderly default by Greece leading to its collapse out of the euro. Further, Italy and Spain could suffer bank runs that could exacerbate the bloc's pain. However, such an outcome could be avoided should a moderate party win a majority in the Greek elections, securing the country's future in the eurozone, he said. De Castries points to the Spanish banking crisis as one which must be resolved so Europe can allay concerns about the strength of its firewalls. ""We need to be sure that we don't just have the fire brigade,"" he said, ""but that water is coming out of the pipe. The Spanish case is a good test for that."" AXA, the second-biggest insurer in Europe, has been offloading its investments in Greek debt -- at a 78% write-down -- and no longer buys Italian and Spanish debt, as it seeks to distance itself from the deepening crisis. De Castries said the company's investment portfolio is being kept diverse: ""We have approximately 80% of our assets in bonds, of which half or a little less are in sovereign bonds. The other half is in corporate bonds and 20% are in other asset classes such as equities and real estate,"" he added. CNN's Anna Stewart contributed to this article .","Eurozone's economic troubles are too complex to be solved by a Greek exit, says AXA CEO .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Fourteen mothers, whose children prosecutors say were sexually abused by a Los Angeles teacher facing 23 felony charges, sued the school district on Tuesday seeking damages for ""generalized shock and trauma."" The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, also seeks unspecified ""compensatory economic and special damages for medical expenses,"" which include psychological therapy, according to court papers and attorneys for the plaintiffs. The suit also seeks reforms to the Los Angeles Unified School District, which ""has a practice and custom of maintaining a 'Culture of Silence' to hide teacher misconduct, and to ignore teacher misconduct,"" the suit said. The legal action stems from a criminal case against former teacher Mark Berndt of Miramonte Elementary, who is being held on $23 million bond and faces 23 felony counts of lewd acts on children. Berndt, 61, pleaded not guilty in February to allegations he bound young students, then photographed them with semen-filled spoons held at their mouths and three-inch cockroaches crawling across their faces, among other graphic depictions. L.A. schools review past 40 years of teacher discipline cases in misconduct crisis . The 23 victims were between 7 and 10 years old, and all but two of them were girls, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said. The 14 mothers' lawsuit says Berndt took photographs of their children ""with cookies in the mouths of plaintiff's children, and/or blindfolded the children, and/or placed cockroaches on the bodies of plaintiff's children, for the intent of arousing and gratifying the lust, passions and sexual desires of Mark Berndt."" One of two mothers who spoke at a press conference on Tuesday said her now 10-year-old daughter was victimized by Berndt while a student at Miramonte from 2009 to 2010. CNN, which has interviewed the mother in recent months, isn't identifying the mother or other parents in order to protect the identities of the children. ""I am asking for justice and I want justice to be done to this man,"" the mother, 43, said. She wants the district to be held accountable for its ""negligence,"" she said. In a recent CNN interview, the mother said her daughter went to Berndt's classroom, where ""he would give her some cookies. My daughter told me that the teacher would say the cookies had sugar and some white stuff that was on it,"" the mother said. In that CNN interview, the mother was joined by her daughter, who told CNN: ""We would help him clean his class and he would give us cookies. ""They were white and they had a white stuff on top, and he would put some sort of powder"" on the cookie, the girl said. The parents told CNN they didn't tell their daughter what could have been on the cookie. The girl's father, 46, who joined his wife at Tuesday's press conference, told CNN the couple doesn't want money but rather justice, so other families won't ""suffer what's happening to us,"" the dad said. Their daughter is now enrolled at another school. The daughter and mother are both in counseling, he said. ""We don't want money, because our children's health physically and mentally is not going to be the same,"" the father said. California teacher pleads not guilt in student 'bondage' case . The other mother at Tuesday's press conference told reporters that her daughter is now rebellious and is also in counseling. Five of the children in the civil lawsuit are among the 23 alleged victims in the criminal case, said Luis A. Carrillo, the attorney for the 14 mothers. Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives are investigating the accusations of the nine other children identified as victims in the civil suit, Carrillo said. Sheriff's Lt. Carlos Marquez, the lead investigator in the case, said Tuesday that detectives interviewed more than 100 Miramonte students and have presented all those cases to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office for review. It's up to the district attorney whether to bring charges on behalf of additional victims, beyond the current 23, Marquez said. Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office, declined to comment Tuesday on whether additional charges would be filed. Berndt's attorney, public defender Victor Acevedo, declined to comment Tuesday because he hadn't seen the lawsuit. David Holmquist, general counsel for the Los Angeles school district, said student safety was the system's ""paramount priority."" ""The district is committed to working with the Miramonte community and everyone impacted by these incidents to improve trust and promote healing,"" Holmquist said in a statement. ""While the district has yet to receive the latest complaint, we are continuing our efforts to ensure that we are doing everything possible to provide a safe learning and working environment for our students and staff."" In May, another civil lawsuit was filed against the school district on behalf of 22 children who claimed they were sexually abused by Berndt, said Carrillo, who also is the attorney for the plaintiffs in that case. The lawsuit, also filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, alleged that Berndt ""engaged in sexual assault, sexual harassment, which includes sex discrimination per LAUSD's policies, and/or sexual exploitation of the plaintiffs that included lewd, obscene and/or lascivious acts"" with the 22 children age 6 to 9 years old between 2002 and 2011, court papers said. The children of the 14 mothers in Tuesday's lawsuit are also part of the May lawsuit, Carrillo said. In December 2010, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department began investigating Berndt after authorities learned of hundreds of ""questionable photographs of children on film that Mr. Berndt had brought (to) a local store to have developed,"" according to Tuesday's lawsuit. Berndt was removed from his teaching job in January 2011 after school officials learned of the police investigation, authorities said. Authorities have said they have discovered roughly 600 images allegedly taken by Berndt in his classroom. A teacher for 30 years, Berndt initially challenged the school district's decision to dismiss him. But he eventually dropped his appeal and resigned in spring 2011. His arrest in January led to broader fallout over the adequacy of safeguards for the school's students and the prospect of more victims. Days after Berndt was taken into custody, another Miramonte Elementary teacher -- Martin Springer, 49 -- was arrested and charged with three felony counts of lewd acts with a girl younger than 14. He has pleaded not guilty. The Los Angeles Unified School District board subsequently shut Miramonte for two days, during which the board reconstituted the entire staff in the 1,400-student school. Miramonte is in unincorporated Los Angeles County within the Florence-Firestone area, about six miles south of downtown Los Angeles.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Before Susan Boyle came along and gave nearly everyone in the world goosebumps, there was Paul Potts. Paul Potts zoomed to fame thanks to his win on ""Britain's Got Talent"" two years ago. The winner of the TV program ""Britain's Got Talent"" in 2007, Potts recalls the butterflies he felt in the lead-up to his audition. ""I'm not really sure what made me walk on the stage in the end,"" he says. ""It did feel like I was walking under my own motion. Especially going out in front of Simon Cowell. I've always respected him for his honesty. I just didn't want to be on the receiving end of it."" Like Boyle, Potts was initially scoffed at by the audience when he stood before the judges. With his crooked teeth and generous waistline, he seemed an unlikely fit for a talent show. But just like Boyle, he blew everybody's socks off when he opened his mouth to sing -- in his case, Puccini's ""Nessun Dorma."" A struggling cell phone salesman from Wales at the time, Potts became an overnight -- and YouTube -- sensation. And now, two years later, the 38-year-old tenor is relating to Boyle's meteoric rise.  Watch Potts perform -- and offer advice Â» . ""I think Susan demonstrates that anything can happen,"" said Potts. ""There's always something about somebody you don't know that can surprise you.""  Watch Boyle's famous performance Â» . Potts says he's noticed that Boyle's sudden fame has helped sweep new listeners his way. And the timing is perfect; yesterday he released his second album, ""Passione,"" a collection of tracks sung in Italian, including a classical version of the song ""A Whiter Shade of Pale."" The album follows Potts' debut release, ""One Chance,"" which sold more than 3 million copies and topped album charts in 15 countries. Potts might soon find himself on the big screen. He said Cowell is planning a film about his story. Potts said he even met with a screenwriter. However, he added, ""I'll only believe it when it actually happens."" Potts sat down with CNN to talk about excruciating dental work, apologetic bullies and the coin toss that changed his life. CNN: Is there going to be a duet, or album of duets with you and Susan Boyle? Paul Potts: I think we'll see what happens. ... I think we'll take each step as it comes. I wouldn't want to be another voice adding pressure on the remainder of Susan's journey. CNN: Much fuss has been made about Susan Boyle's appearance and whether or not she should have a makeover. How do you feel about that? Potts: I think she should be allowed to change anything she wants. I don't think she should be forced to change anything, but I don't think she should be forced to remain as she was either. Because at the end of the day you have to live with yourself for much longer than the attention that can be on you. CNN: Did you feel you were expected to make some changes? Potts: No, I think I was under similar sort of pressures as Susan's finding herself at the moment. I've had people say, ""Well, why didn't you leave your teeth as they were?"" Well, I think I'd have felt like a bit of a freak show if I'd have kept my teeth the way they were. ... Even though I was happy I couldn't show it as much as I wanted to because I was ashamed of my teeth. Also there were health reasons. My bottom teeth were being damaged by my upper teeth so something had to be done about it. I still remember the actual dental work being done. I actually had 17 injections to numb me out and I could still feel everything. CNN: Is it true that you based your decision on whether or not to audition for ""Britain's Got Talent"" by tossing a coin? Potts: Yeah, I decided if it landed on heads then I'd apply for the show, if it landed on tails then I'd cancel the application I'd prepared. I couldn't decide if I was good enough. ... I knew that I didn't look like somebody who'd stand a remote chance of getting through. And I wondered if I was too old. And so I flipped a coin for that decision. CNN: Have you kept that coin? Potts: Nope. I spent it on lunch. How many times I could've put 10 pence on eBay, I don't know. CNN: Do you ever wonder where it is right now? Because that 10 pence basically changed the course of your life, didn't it? Potts: It did. I think it started its next journey in a pastry shop two doors down from the shop I was managing. CNN: You've gone in a more classical direction with your new album, wouldn't you say? Potts: I think it's slightly more classical than the first one but I think it's still approachable. I think in the end, music is music. I'm not too precious about divisions in music. I think there's no issue with taking an iconic rock song like ""Whiter Shade of Pale"" ... and turning it into something a bit more classical. CNN: You were bullied in school, and music was a source of comfort. Since you've become really famous, have any of those bullies come out of the woodwork and tried to contact you? Potts: I've had contact with one or two. I had somebody send me a message through a Web site asking for forgiveness. And my reply to them was, ""There's nothing to forgive. It's in the past."" I think if you allow negative parts of your life to take over your future then it's like in ""Star Wars,"" really. The dark side wins. So it's important to remain positive about the present and the future and just leave as much of the past behind as possible. CNN: Is there anything that you miss about being a cell phone salesman? Potts: Just the camaraderie of the people I worked with. I do keep in touch with them via text message, ironically enough.","Paul Potts won ""Britain's Got Talent"" two years ago .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Regina Spektor has pretty pale blue eyes, but you won't see them if she's performing. Singer-songwriter Regina Spektor has just released her third album. ""I play most of my songs with my eyes closed,"" says the Moscow, Russia-born singer-songwriter. ""I don't know why, but a lot of the time I don't realize that I'm doing it. It's weird."" Perhaps, but here's a musician who's known for being a little quirky. On the track ""Folding Chairs"" off her new album, ""Far"" (Sire Records) Spektor imitates the sound a dolphin makes. And in the music video for her peppy song ""Dance Anthem of The '80s"" she gets her face so close to the camera that at times you think she's going to gobble it up. But in person, the classically trained pianist is shy and soft spoken. And she recalls her third album's debut last month at No. 3 on the Billboard album chart -- a career high -- with genuine surprise.  Watch an interview with Regina Spektor Â» . ""I was in England when I found out,"" she says. ""It was just very, very trippy."" Spektor invited CNN to crash the set at AOL's New York headquarters last week where she was filming a live performance for the music show, ""The Interface."" She talked about the floppiness of the '80s and what it's like to be a songwriter who never writes anything down. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Your song ""Eet"" is about forgetting the lyrics to your favorite song. Do you ever forget the lyrics of your own songs when you're performing? Regina Spektor: Yeah. I forget a lot. I try not to. I practice, but it all depends on how much coffee I've had before. Sometimes when I get the balance wrong, then all of a sudden all my songs become a mystery to me. It's like the teleprompter inside my head just goes off and I can't remember anything. CNN: So what are you thinking about when you're performing with your eyes closed? Spektor: I'm not really thinking that much of anything. I'm sort of in this state that's between thought and feeling. I think it's more of a feel state than a think state. CNN: Your song ""Dance Anthem of the '80s"" is very cute. Did the music of that decade make a big impression on you? Spektor: Yeah, I think because I spent all the '80s in the Soviet Union, my '80s were the '90s...even the beginning of 2000 actually. But I just love the fun of it. I think that it's not so dark and ""me."" It's very extroverted and it just doesn't take itself seriously. Fun, weird sounds and fun hair, and floppy everything. Even though artistically it was really a fun decade, I think economically it was a very dangerous decade. It was a time of big, fast spenders and people who just didn't really think about the consequences of their greed. CNN: What was the appeal of working with four different producers for your new album? Spektor: Well, I sort of figured that since I get to make albums pretty rarely -- so far it's been one every three years - that I should take as much opportunity as I can and learn from people. I loved working with David Kahn on the last record, ""Begin to Hope."" And then this time I worked with him and then three more producers and just tried to learn as much as I could from each one. CNN: Was there any concern that the album might not sound cohesive? Spektor: No. I don't know why everybody wants things to be cohesive in the first place. I really love different things, and I think that things feel great when they're thrown in contrast. That's how you let one thing fulfill the other. I like things that are just all over the place. CNN: Is it true that when you're creating a song you don't write anything down? Spektor: Yeah, but I wouldn't say that's a good thing. I think it's pretty stupid. I just sort of play it over and over again until it's cemented in my head. I'm not good about writing stuff down. I don't know. I think it's some sort of laziness. It's how I forget a lot of stuff. CNN: But it seems to work. The good ones stick. Spektor: Yeah and some of the bad ones stick, and some of the good ones get forgotten. CNN: So when do you know you have something that's worth recording? Spektor: I feel that feeling all the time that I need to record before I forget it. I've actually gotten better because I used to just have to hold the songs in my head until the next time I would record them. But now I have a laptop and I've learned how to do GarageBand. It remembers for me. CNN: How involved are you with coming up with the concepts for your music videos? Spektor: Well (with) some of them I'm very involved. And (with) some of them I wasn't involved at all. CNN: You just showed up? Spektor: No I've never been that not involved. I guess my not involved at all is still very involved. I think it's really cool that musicians get to make music videos because it's our chance to learn about cameras and cinematography and this whole other world that goes on. My first ever video which was for a song called ""Us"" I made with my friend Adria Petty. We're always coming up with things together. We kind of incubate and make a lot of art together, share ideas. But it's really fun the other way, too, like when I made a video with Mark Webb for ""Fidelity."" That was really cool because he had listened to the song and the video concept was his idea. And I just got to come in and be directed more, be part of his take on a song, and that was really fun, too. CNN: On your song ""Folding Chairs,"" you impersonate a dolphin. How did that happen?

"(CNN) -- The forthcoming trial in Germany of John Demjanjuk could be the last occasion on which a Nazi war crimes suspect faces prosecution. German officials claim John Demjanjuk was an accessory to 29,000 murders in a Nazi death camp. But the legacy of decades-old efforts to bring the perpetrators of World War II atrocities to justice means that those who commit similar offences in the 21st century will not be able to hide from their past so easily, according to a leading war crimes prosecutor. Many leading Nazis such as Hermann Goering, Rudolf Hess and Albert Speer were prosecuted by the main allies -- the U.S., the Soviet Union and the UK -- shortly after the end of the war at the Nuremberg Trials. South African judge Richard Goldstone, formerly the chief U.N. prosecutor for war crimes in Yugoslavia and Rwanda, told CNN that Nuremberg had been the ""first attempt of any importance to hold war criminals accountable"" and had laid the foundations for the development of modern humanitarian law. Yet many lower-ranking servants of the Nazi regime and its allies were able to escape punishment for their crimes, assuming new identities, fleeing Europe or even finding employment with Soviet or western security agencies as determination to bring them to justice waned with the advent of the Cold War, according to Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center. ""These murderers walked into small cities and killed men, women and children and walked away without a trace,"" Hier told CNN. ""The sad thing is that had the world wanted to prosecute Nazi war criminals after Nuremberg, and had (countries) put up the budget and the resources then every one of these elusive criminals would have been brought to justice."" But Goldstone said that the creation in 2002 of the International Criminal Court marked a ""very important step forward"" to ensure that future atrocities would not be so quickly forgotten. While previous tribunals investigating crimes in Rwanda and Yugoslavia were ad hoc creations set up by the U.N. Security Council, the ICC is a permanent institution with a specific remit to investigate and prosecute cases of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Goldstone said that developments in humanitarian law and the evolution of international justice meant that modern institutions were more sophisticated and fairer than Nuremberg had been, recognizing the rights of victims to representation but also ensuring a fair trial for defendants. ""Modern international law requires trials that are a lot fairer than the trials that were put on at Nuremberg,"" he said. The jurisdiction of the ICC is currently recognized by 108 countries -- though not by the U.S., Russia or China. But Goldstone said the court was ""moving quickly"" towards universal ratification and said U.S. President Barack Obama's new administration was likely to be more cooperative and friendlier to the ICC than predecessor George W. Bush had been in office. ""I'd love to see the day when there is universal ratification because when that happens there will be nowhere for war criminals to run to,"" he said. Demjanjuk, an 89-year-old native Ukrainian deported from the U.S. this week, is alleged to have been a guard at the Sobibor death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland and is accused of being an accessory to the murder of more than 29,000 people. Hier said Demjanjuk's extradition marked the culmination of greater efforts in the U.S. since the late 1970s to send suspected war criminals to face trial. An Office of Special Investigations was established in 1979 to hunt for war criminals on U.S. soil, while legislation allowed even suspects who had acquired U.S. citizenship to be extradited for lying on their naturalization papers about their Nazi pasts. But he said Demjanjuk's trial could be the last of its kind -- and not just because of the age of suspected war criminals still at large. ""You can't just have a trial with documents. You have to have living witnesses,"" Hier said. ""Most of those witnesses are very old, most of them are well into their 80s and beyond and they have to be in sufficient good health that they can be questioned and travel to take part in the trial."" But Hier said it was very important that former Nazis were pursued to the grave, living out their final years with the fear that their past crimes could still catch up with them. ""(Nazi hunter) Simon Wiesenthal talked about two kinds of justice. There is the justice of handcuffs and putting someone on trial. But there is also a psychological fear of a knock on the door,"" he said. ""Every Nazi war criminal should live every night of his life with the possibility that in his case there will yet be a knock on the door.""","Expert: Trial of Nazi war crimes suspect John Demjanjuk could be last of its kind .

"Editor's note: A nationally syndicated columnist, Roland S. Martin is the author of ""Listening to the Spirit Within: 50 Perspectives on Faith"" and ""Speak, Brother! A Black Man's View of America."" Visit his Web site for more information. Roland Martin says Colin Powell should back up his words with action to reshape the GOP. (CNN) -- The back-and-forth between former Secretary of State Colin Powell, former Vice President Dick Cheney, and radio entertainer Rush Limbaugh, has been, well, entertaining and fascinating. You have these enormous personalities and egos slamming into each other over what it means to be a Republican and the course the party should be on, as it is in desperate need of a vision. Yet while folks like me in the media love the brouhaha, and TV and radio producers salivate at the chance to book any one of these three on their programs, the inevitable question has to be asked: What now? And this is where former House Speaker Newt Gingrich is correct. Powell must go beyond commenting on the state of the party and what it needs, and work to help rebuild, reshape and revitalize the GOP in the form he thinks is appropriate for the 21st century. Let's be clear: Powell is under no obligation to hit the road campaigning for candidates, raising funds, participating in strategy sessions, and the dirty work necessary to make his vision a reality. But unless a leader such as Powell champions the cause of a moderate Republican Party, what he has been saying lately will be merely words. It has been my contention after the 2008 presidential election that the Republican Party is in desperate need of a separate entity that would have the same effect on the GOP as the Democratic Leadership Council had on the Democrats. Talk to liberal Dems and they will tell you the DLC aimed to counter the impact the Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. had on the party after his presidential runs in 1984 and 1988 -- they feared the left dominating the party levers. So these largely white southerners, and moderate and conservative Democrats created the DLC to broaden the Democratic Party's reach, make it more palatable to big business, and fiscal conservatism. And who came out of this effort? Then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, a co-founder of the DLC who went on to win two terms as president, and dominate the party for 16 years until President Obama came along. This, frankly, is what is needed in the Republican Party. It would be a hell of a thing to witness Powell take his stature and considerable influence and band together with other liberal-to-moderate Republicans to create an organization that represents their values and vision. Like it or not, the opposition to them in the GOP is already organized with infrastructure and a fundraising mechanism. So to counter them, there has to be an entity that people can look to, or enlist in, to show the rest of the world that Powell isn't whistling in the wind, but has thousands -- or millions -- standing behind him and those who think like him. If such an organization was created, and all of a sudden you had chapters forming in states across the country, you would have the infrastructure to identify candidates to run in local and state races, and challenge the people Powell and others think are driving the party further into isolation as a largely southern and regional party. It's clear the GOP has enormous problems in the Northeast part of the country, and with Obama winning a sizeable portion of the Hispanic vote, and the party's staunch opposition to illegal immigration, it is going to have a hell of a time in the Southwest and West. And with a fractured party, there is no better time to create an alternative that people can believe in and rally behind. On CNN last week, senior analyst Gloria Borger said there clearly is a civil war raging within the GOP, and Powell and Cheney are on opposite sides. I chimed in that in any war, I'd trust the guy who put on a military uniform -- Powell -- rather than the guy who ran from serving our country -- Cheney. Powell has clearly shown he is adept at leading our troops to victory on the battlefield by planning and shaping a perfect battle plan to defeat the enemy. Now it's time to see if he has the chops to do the same in the political arena, where the enemy is not as readily identifiable. There is no doubt he has the capacity to do it. It's now a question of whether he wants to do it. As the old saying goes, you can talk the talk or walk the walk. Mr. Powell, do you have your walking shoes on? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S. Martin.","Roland Martin: Colin Powell is right to advocate a broader, more moderate GOP .

"Paris (CNN) -- A hostage-taking incident in Toulouse, France, ended with shots fired, the gunman wounded and the last two remaining hostages freed, police union spokesman Christophe Crepin said Wednesday. The gunman, who said he was with al Qaeda, took four people hostage at a bank five hours earlier, police said. He released one of them, a woman, after about three hours, Crepin said, and a second hostage was released about an hour after that. The incident ended after the man emerged from the bank with a hostage and attempted to shoot police officers, Crepin said. A hostage negotiator had earlier spoken to the gunman by phone, Crepin said. Described as a man in his 20s or 30s from France's Haute-Garonne region, the gunman was ""very, very agitated"" during the talks, he said. Authorities have not officially identified the hostage-taker, security police spokesman Frederic Tamisier said. He said the two remaining hostages were freed after the shootout, in which the gunman was ""not badly"" injured. Toulouse prosecutor Michel Valet said the gunman fired two shots as the action began. He said the four hostages are all safe and sound. The hostage-taker is in a Toulouse hospital, he said, but not in a critical condition. He has two injuries -- one in the left hand and the other in the right thigh -- which, Valet said, indicate that police sought to neutralize him to protect the hostages, rather than trying to kill him. The hostage-taker was armed with a pistol that usually fires rubber bullets but can be converted to fire lethal rounds, Valet said. No more shots were fired from either side once the hostages were secured, he added. ""We can consider that things have ended rather well, no police officers injured, that the four hostages are not injured either, and that the hostage-taker, while he may be injured, his life is apparently not in danger,"" he said. Valet said the man suffers from ""psychological troubles, and his acts are linked to these claims which are badly defined, badly expressed. At this hour, it is difficult to know exactly what is driving his behavior, (which is) everything but rational."" President Francois Hollande hailed the professionalism shown by the police in bringing the situation to a close. ""I rejoice that all the hostages were liberated, safe and sound, and that the hostage-taker was captured,"" he said in a written statement. The incident happened several hundred yards from the scene of a standoff between police and a gunman earlier this year that ended with the gunman dead. In March, police cornered Mohammed Merah, who was wanted in the killing of seven people. He was killed March 22 by police after the 32-hour siege of a Toulouse apartment. Crepin said Wednesday's hostage-taking was an armed robbery that went wrong. The hostages were the director of the bank and three employees, he said. Valet's office was in charge of the situation, he said. Photographer Jenet Gautier, who lives near the bank, said the neighborhood was calm during the incident and the situation was not comparable to the Merah siege. A high school in the area was evacuated, staff there said. Investigations shed new light on Toulouse terrorist shootings . A local real estate agent told CNN that police told her to stay inside and keep her doors locked. Marie Cluzaud, 28, said she was scared but didn't hear any noise connected to the hostage-taking. Streets were blocked off, she said. In the March standoff, Merah was wanted for the killings of three French paratroopers, a rabbi and three Jewish children ages 4, 5, and 7. Two other people were seriously wounded in shootings blamed on him. CNN's Stephanie Halasz, Saskya Vandoorne, Dheepthi Namasivayam, Ines de la Cuetara and Alex Felton contributed to this report.","NEW: President Hollande hails the police operation and safe release of hostages .

"(CNN) -- Hungary -- whose economy is shrinking amid political wrangling -- has been vindicated for its use of ""unconventional"" policies and has emerged from crisis, its finance minister says. Gyorgy Matolcsy has overseen an economy that contracted 1.3% in the first quarter of this year, the worst performance in the European Union. However, it is expected to meet its 2012 budget deficit target of 2.5% of GDP, and Matolcsy said the country's ""crisis is over."" Matolcsy said the country had to implement a series of ""unconventional economic policy measures"" to bring down the deficit, including one-off levies and the effective nationalization of private pensions. The EU has lambasted the measures as unsustainable, but Matolcsy said such moves are ""the future."" The country was ""forced to be innovative and creative,"" he added. Daimler gears up in Hungary . The EU froze Ã¢âÂ¬495 million of development funds for 2013 in response to the policies, but last month proposed lifting these sanctions as it felt the country was taking the right action to tackle its deficit. A meeting of EU finance ministers is expected to make a final decision later this month. Matolcsy said the moves may have been unusual, but had led to ""growth, jobs and creativity."" The EU ""badly needed"" some creativity, he said. Friction remains between the Hungarian government and its lenders, the EU and International Monetary Fund, over additional funds. The main sticking point is a law passed last year that the EU, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund believe jeopardizes the independence of Hungary's central bank, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank. The law paved the way to an increase in council members and deputy governors, along with a new president who would have authority over the bank's governor. The plans raised concerns the bank's independent decision-making process could be undermined. The Hungarian parliament delayed a vote on amendments to the law this week after the ECB indicated that the changes had not gone far enough. Despite the pushback, Matolcsy is confident on Hungary's future. ""The whole central European region will be the next hub for the global business community"", he said. ""It will be a region between Europe and Asia, between the States and the EU."" He added: ""It is the next emerging region and you can find Hungary at its heart.""

"(EW.com) -- Everything is on fire in ""Wrath of the Titans."" Sam Worthington, as the mighty Perseus (otherwise known as the dude who slayed the Kraken), takes on a two-headed griffin-like creature that trashes a village with its incendiary breath. The spears and tridents that various warriors keep clutching glow in their fists like molten iron. And the film's most deluxe monster is Kronos (father of Zeus, Hades and Poseidon), who, after being overthrown and imprisoned, has now risen up in the form of a really, really gigantic giant made entirely of volcanic rock and ash, with humungous arms that disintegrate and reconstitute themselves as they throw off fiery streams of lava. For a movie that's basically all warmed-over pseudo-mythology and special effects, ""Wrath of the Titans"" is certainly more fun, in its solemnly junky way, than ""John Carter."" It may also be a little more fun than its cheeseball predecessor, the 2010 remake of ""Clash of the Titans."" A lot of the digital effects are quite good, though that prompts me to ask: Why do the camerawork and editing have to be so jittery? In the old days, movies used to invite us to sit back and gaze at monsters, to really drink them in. The beasts didn't need to be photographed as if we were watching ""Saving Private Kraken."" The other limitation of ""Wrath of the Titans"" is that the dialogue is mostly made of wet cardboard. What there is of it consists of actors like Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, and Ãâ°dgar RamÃÂ­rez (as the evil Ares) staring at each other and saying ''You're my brother and you betrayed me!'' or ''You're my son and you betrayed me!'' We get it: The gods are losing their power, there's a whole lot of betrayal going on, and this means, somehow, that the world is about to end. It's up to Perseus to amass an army to fight Kronos and the forces of chaos. Maybe it's just my imagination, but Sam Worthington seems to be getting slightly less stiff as an actor. He now smiles occasionally, and he's at least risen to the soulful inexpressiveness of the young Ryan O'Neal. For a movie like ""Wrath of the Titans,"" which is basically ""Gladiator"" crossed with ""Lord of the Rings"" crossed with a special-effects demo reel (call it ""Lord of the Rinky-Dink""), he's the perfect actor.

The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process.

Shockingly, the guy who said this wasn't some antiwar hippie who had just dropped acid. He was a 6'4"" Marine Corps Force Recon sergeant who had recently returned from two tours in Afghanistan. We were both attendees at the 2010 Special Operations Forces Exhibition (SOFEX) in Jordan. His reaction was prompted by the trade-show floor -- a sea of displays and kiosks from weapons companies hawking missiles, machine guns, tanks, and bombs like they were next year's luxury sedans. Even more unsettling, the biggest dealers were from the U.S. When I was a young punk kid, it was fashionable to say things like, ""The military-industrial complex is taking over the world."" At the time, I didn't know what ""military-industrial complex"" meant, but the conference rapidly provided me with a very literal definition of the term. SOFEX takes place every two years in Amman, and is largely the brainchild of Jordan's King Abdullah II, who has a penchant for special operations and massive displays of artillery. Over the course of a week, more than 12,000 attendees tromped through massive tents housing hundreds of arms manufacturers. The atmosphere was insidious but open, an organized free-for-all in which American companies like Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and General Dynamics sold weapons to almost any nation that could afford them. See the rest of SOFEX: The Business of War at VICE.COM . I've been to hundreds of depressing media trade shows, and SOFEX's salespeople are no different from the rest, except that their wares are designed to destroy things and kill people. I witnessed representatives from almost every nation spending millions of dollars on heavy munitions. I was wondering if the transactions were padded by foreign aid from the U.S. and other countries. I heard high-ranking soldiers say things like, ""When I retire I'm going to be on the other side of the table -- ha ha ha ha."" What this means is that it's not uncommon for generals with government-controlled salaries around $100,000 a year to spend the twilight of their careers purchasing billions worth of munitions from arms companies who, in turn, offer these same senior officers state-side ""consulting"" gigs with multimillion-dollar salaries. It's blatant payola, the whole thing so corrupt it borders on absurd. Absurdity, as it turned out, was a running theme of the conference.","VICE goes inside a huge biennial weapons convention in Amman, Jordan .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- It's a good thing Chrisette Michele didn't choke last week when she heard the news she had a No. 1 album on her hands. Chrisette Michele's album ""Epiphany"" debuted at No. 1 earlier in May. ""I was backstage at the David Letterman show on a couch, probably eating grapes,"" says the singer-songwriter. ""I always eat grapes before I go on."" The acid and pectin in the fruit help prepare her voice for performing, the 26-year-old goes on to explain. But nothing, she says, could have prepared her for the excitement she'd feel upon learning her sophomore album, ""Epiphany,"" debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart. She had to go chill out at a lakeside ranch for a couple of days to let it all sink in. But this isn't Michele's first big career moment: She won a Grammy this year in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance category for her single, ""Be OK,"" featuring will.i.am. The song first appeared on her soul-tinged 2007 debut album ""I Am,"" for which she penned all her own lyrics. This time around, Michele, whose voice has earned her comparisons to Billie Holiday and Jill Scott, relinquished some songwriting duties to R&B singer Ne-Yo. Michele talked to CNN about the experience of sharing pen and paper, the real-life epiphany behind ""Epiphany"" and why she likes making mischief.  Watch Michele belt out a tune Â» . CNN: Have you had a big epiphany recently? Michele: I have epiphanies all the time, because I'm always thinking. I'm a thinker. I'm always writing poetry, I'm always coming to conclusions. The latest epiphany is that I really don't have to be afraid of anybody. And the reason why it was an epiphany was when I first started, I was so afraid that maybe they won't like me. And I was just being myself, I was being really honest. And so I felt that if they didn't like me that would really hurt. But I found out that there's a lot more lovers out there than I realized, and the world is much smaller than I thought. And so there's no need to be afraid. CNN: Tell me about the single. Michele: ""Epiphany"" is about a girl who's sitting on her couch and saying ""You know what? I'm sick and tired of waiting for these phone calls. I'm sick and tired of waiting for him to come home."" I think I'm just about over being his girlfriend. And that's her epiphany. That's her a-ha moment. CNN: How does this album demonstrate how you've progressed as an artist? Michele: One way is that I didn't write some of the songs. Pride destroyed! Ego smashed! Pens, pencils thrown across the room! It was so tough at first. But then I started working with Ne-Yo. Ne-Yo is the easiest person to talk to, and he made my experiences come to life with his lyrics. I was afraid that if somebody took the pen and the pad that it would suddenly turn into somebody else. But he did a wonderful job of capturing Chrisette Michele and it was a beautiful experience. CNN: Who's your favorite jazz performer in the world? Michele: Ella Fitzgerald. But I can't narrow it down to just one. I get excited when we talk about jazz. CNN: Which living jazz musician would you like to work with? Michele: Diana Krall. A female piano player is always pretty cool to me. I went to school, did jazz and there weren't a lot of ladies who sat down and did those jazz things at the keys that she does. CNN: Why don't you think young people appreciate jazz as much? Michele: I'm an advocate of music in schools. It's important to me that music is in as many schools as possible across this country and across the world. I think that it's a lost art form because kids aren't as exposed to it as maybe they used to be, or should be. I was exposed heavily to jazz and that's why I love it. CNN: I hear you're a bit of a prankster. Michele: When I was in school I used to prank my teachers all the time. But I was really, really nice. I love to make people laugh. And even in those pranks, the teachers would laugh most of the time. CNN: What's your favorite album of 2009 so far? Michele: Mine (smiles mischievously). CNN: Besides yours. Michele: What is in my iPod right now on repeat is John Legend's ""Evolver."" I can't get enough of that record. I also love Adele's new album. It's incredible, especially the live side. Those are two that are on my radar.","Chrisette Michele's album ""Epiphany"" debuted at No. 1 earlier in May .

"(CNN) -- Euro 2012 is beginning to resemble the eurozone -- a case of sport imitating economics. It may be early days at the quadrennial football tournament that fixates tens of millions of Europeans from the Urals to the Atlantic, but there are worrying signs that some teams are mimicking national roles in the evolving Euro crisis. The evidence so far: Germany have been austere and unforgiving compared to their expansive play in the last World Cup. One can almost hear Chancellor Angel Merkel in the locker room wagging her finger and demanding: ""Don't give anything away."" Against Portugal they didn't, eking out victory with a utilitarian efficiency that echoes German leadership on the European stage. Speaking of Portugal, they may yet wake up in time to reach the next stage of the tournament, but like the other European bail-out countries they looked uncertain and have a lot of work to do to stay in the eurozone Euro 2012. Denmark stun Dutch as Germany beat Portugal . Ireland, another country that had to seek help from the European Union and IMF, were humbled by Croatia in their first game. Perhaps Europe's center of economic gravity is, as some have speculated, shifting eastward -- if not its sense of humor. Some Irish fans held aloft a banner proclaiming: ""Angela Merkel Thinks We're Working."" There was a bad start for another of the bail-out nations. After games against Poland and the Czech Republic, Greece had amassed just one point (if only their interest rates were the same, rather than 29% on the 10-year bond.) They had one player red-carded (an omen for a disorderly exit from the eurozone?) And their defensive formation was less than convincing -- vulnerable to attacks from the left- and right-wings. Cue Sunday's election. New Greek woes at Euro 2012 . Spain and Italy -- the two countries that might be most affected by the contagion of a disorderly Greek exit (from the eurozone rather than from Euro 2012) -- played out a somewhat cautious 1-1 draw in their opening match. Maybe they were thinking that one day they might need each other in asking for help from Europe and in arguing for more growth-oriented policies. A cut-away in the TV coverage of the match of an Italian and Spanish fan kissing gave it all away. Cesc Fabregas rescues point for Spain . Apparently some investment analysts have also sought light relief from their day jobs in predicting the winners and losers at Euro 2012, using all those sophisticated computer models that have served us so well in the past few years. Researchers at Dutch bank ABN Amro justified time on the project by saying ""football is the most important of all unimportant things."" Which is plainly ridiculous, as most people know it's not just a game but a way of life. Anyway, ABN Amro compared countries' footballing pedigree with their credit-rating, and (surprise) concluded Germany would lift the trophy on July 1. They also said that as the euro crisis is largely one of confidence, ""we believe it would be best if one of the eurozone countries won Euro 2012. A victory for one of the opt-out countries (Denmark, England, Sweden) would not be welcome because it would only encourage the eurosceptics."" Who will win Euro 2012? This is just the sort of special pleading that has got Europe into its current state. And an immediate riposte came from the Danish team, who dispatched the much-favored Dutch 1-0 in their opening game. The Danes have got quite good at this. They won the European championships in 1992, a month after voting against the Maastricht Treaty on European integration. After Denmark beat Germany in a memorable final, Foreign Minister Uffe Elleman-Jensen, surely one of the most affable European politicians ever, quipped 'If you can't join them, beat them."" The Danish approach this year was layers of disciplined defense. The English formation against France was similar -- a sort of bulldog defiance characteristic of a nation that's never been quite sure of its European destiny. Stoic England hold French as Sweden lose . At Italian bank UniCredit, the experts took a rigorously financial approach to football (though they might be better employed investigating the fragility of some Italian banks.) They calculated the worth of each team based on the transfer market value of their players and predicted this semi-final line-up: . ""Portugal (338 million euros) against Spain (658 million euros); and Germany (459 million euros) against England (392 million euros). Of course these values are declining every day as the euro sinks against the dollar and the pound. In what might be bad news for Germany's chances, there could be an inverse relationship (economic jargon) between financial health and sporting prowess. Greece won Euro 2004 and Italy lifted the World Cup in 2006; Spain won both Euro 2008 and the World Cup in 2010. Or it may be that these countries are in an economic mess precisely because their men-folk are outside playing football all the time. That football explains the world is well known. Franklin Foer, author of ""How Football Explains the World: An Unlikely Theory of Globalization,"" wrote that ""wandering among lunatic fans, gangster owners and crazed Bulgarian strikers, I kept noticing the ways that globalization had failed to diminish the game's local cultures, local blood feuds and even local corruption."" In other words, football is Exhibit A in the argument that national pride will never be subsumed by the worthy but essentially dull goal of European integration. One look at the Polish fans belting out their national anthem Tuesday before the game against Russia (surely no historic animosity there) would confirm that. Should players know their anthems? In fact Europeans may become so consumed by the tournament that the markets will simply forget to mark down the euro or price Spanish debt at record highs. The Market Monetarist blog uncovered research by economists at the Dutch Central Bank from the last World Cup in 2010. Using minute-by-minute trading data for fifteen stock exchanges, they found that when the national team was playing, the number of trades dropped by 45%. The Spanish Prime Minister is doing his best to use Euro 2012 as a way of playing down his country's debt crisis. Hours after his government was offered 100 billion euros to help its indebted banks, Rajoy jetted off to Poland to watch Spain's first game. ""I am going because the Spanish team are world champions and I think it is good that the head of government be at this inaugural game,"" he said. No hint of escapism. But now I feel bad. Many Europeans couldn't wait for the Euro 2012 championships to begin just to escape the barrage of negative headlines about their continent's future. The last thing they wanted was the competition becoming a metaphor (albeit a less than convincing one) for their problems.

"(CNN) -- Reigning Olympic champion Rafael Nadal has been forced to withdraw from the London 2012 Olympics due to ongoing knee problems. Nadal, gold medallist four years ago in Beijing admitted he was ""not in the right physical condition to compete"" and that he had to ""think about Spanish sport."" The world number two, who was due to carry Spain's flag at the opening ceremony, had already taken two weeks off in the buildup to the Olympics to recover from tendinitis in his knee . ""I've waited until the final moment of my preparation and my training, but I cannot do it,"" Nadal said in a statement released to the Spanish press on Thursday. ""Today is one of the saddest days in my career. Carrying the flag for Spain at the opening ceremony was set to be one of the biggest honors, one of the most special moments for me. ""For this reason I hope you can understand how difficult it has been for me to take this decision. One of my teammates who is better prepared than me can take my place and compete to the best of his ability."" The Spanish Tennis Federation announced that world number 30 Feliciano Lopez would take Nadal's spot in the singles competition. Marc Lopez, who has won doubles titles with Nadal on the ATP tour, will take his place in the doubles competition. The Spanish Olympic Federation have chosen basketball star Pau Gasol as the new flag bearer. Former world number one Nadal recorded his 11th grand slam win at June's French Open, but crashed out of Wimbledon in the second round to unfancied Czech player Lukas Rosol. Nadal had only two weeks to make the transition from the clay courts of Roland Garros to Wimbledon's grass courts, but in future he will have longer to adapt. Wimbledon organizers announced on Thursday that from 2015 there will be an extra week between the two slams. ""The best interests of tennis will be served by allowing the players more time to recuperate and to adjust from the clay of Roland Garros to the grass at Wimbledon,"" said All England Club chairman Philip Brook. ""We think most players welcome the prospect of a longer grass court season and spending more time on the softer surface of grass. ""In making this change from 2015 we recognize that there will be some important consequences for the overall tennis calendar, and enough time needs to be given to allow us all to plan accordingly.""","Reigning champion Nadal forced out of London Games by ongoing knee problem .

"(CNN) -- Many science fiction fans take for granted that there's no sound in the vastness of space. But Janna Levin, a physics and astronomy professor at Barnard College, says dramatic events in space do make a kind of music. ""There's no air in space to compress to ring against your ear,"" she told CNN in an interview at the TED conference in Long Beach, California, in March. ""But it's important to realize the universe isn't a silent film, because space itself wobbles and rumbles like a drum in response to all of these things unfolding in the cosmos."" ""If space itself is ringing and squeezing and stretching, your eardrums can resonate in response ... you could hear the sound of very dramatic events in the universe,"" Levin said. In a talk at TED, Levin illustrated her point by conjuring up an example of two black holes spinning around each other and coalescing. ""Black holes can bang on space time like mallets on a drum,"" she said. Watch Janna Levin's TED Talk . She added in the interview, ""We can design experiments that can pick up the ringing of space ... you can plug that into the stereo system and pick up the sound.""

New York (HBO) -- In February 2010, U.S. Marines launched Afghanistan: Operation Moshtarak, the biggest operation since the start of the Afghanistan war. Its main target was the Taliban stronghold of Marjah, a town in Helmand province. Journalist Ben Anderson, who spent two months with the American forces, offers an extraordinarily intimate look at the brutal realities of modern-day warfare in the harrowing documentary ""The Battle For Marjah,"" debuting Thursday, February 17 at 9 p.m. ET exclusively on HBO, marking the first anniversary of this historic battle. Operation Moshtarak was the first attack launched after the Obama administration announced plans to send 30,000 troops to Afghanistan, serving as a key test of the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy against the Taliban. The campaign had four distinct phases: clear Marjah of Taliban, hold all ground seized, build infrastructure and governance and transfer control to Afghan security forces. In addition to chronicling the operation, ""The Battle For Marjah"" asks whether the policy is a successful prototype for winning this kind of war. Anderson spent two months embedded with Bravo Company, the first Marines dropped into the center of Marjah, where they encountered a maze of improvised explosive devices, bunkers, trenches and ambushes set by well-trained Taliban fighters. The new rules of engagement, dubbed ""courageous restraint"" by Gen. Stanley McChrystal, meant they could not fire until fired upon and had great difficulty getting airstrikes approved. While these rules were intended to limit civilian causalities, they put the Marines in highly treacherous situations. Bravo Company's leader, Capt. Ryan Sparks, is a mentor and friend to many of the young Marines, often making split-second decisions when lives are in danger. He acknowledges the challenges when he addresses his men, saying, ""I guarantee you we will lose Marines. I guarantee you we will. Don't let emotions control you. There's 80,000 civilians in this city; there's maybe a thousand enemy. So when I go home, I don't want to feel ashamed because I'm having problems sleeping at night, because I'm not sure that I did the right thing. What happens over the next five days will be a cornerstone of your memory for the rest of your life."" See the rest of ""The Battle For Marjah"" at VBS.TV . Anderson joined the Marines on the front lines of combat and in makeshift sleeping quarters, where he caught glimpses of their personal lives. One Marine confesses how much he misses his 5-month-old son, having spent only two months with him before leaving for battle. ""The Battle For Marjah"" also looks at the relationship between the Marines and the Afghan people. As Sparks explains, the key to success is ""to get the people on your side, and let them understand that you're here for them,"" not an easy task when the locals lose friends and loved ones by following the Marines' orders. For example, the documentary shows one man receiving a condolence payment when members of his family are killed by a stray rocket after being told to stay inside for shelter. The Marines' mission is complicated by their Afghan partners -- the army, police and government. The government is nowhere to be seen, the police are feared by the locals, and the army soldiers -- a few of whom accompany the Marines into battle -- are a liability. In addition, the members of the Afghan army assigned to the area are from the north and speak a different language and come from different ethnic groups than the residents of Marjah. Although they achieve their initial mission, when Anderson returns four months later, the Marines have lost 20% of their fighting force to casualties, and battle daily to maintain their shrinking zone of control. Meanwhile, the local economy is still in shambles and the future of the war is in question. Still, as one Marine remarks, ""Marines fight battles, they don't fight wars.""","Documentary marks first anniversary of largest operation since start of the Afghan war .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Kidnappers in Egypt have released two Americans and their Egyptian tour guide after holding them hostage for three days, a security official said Monday. ""They are at security headquarters with us now, in good condition. The negotiations succeeded, but we did not give in to the kidnappers' demands,"" said Gen. Ahmed Bakr, head of security in northern Sinai. The freed Americans told CNN they are happy and relieved. ""We are heading directly to Israel to join the members of our church as soon as we get our passports sent to us from Cairo,"" said Michel Louis, the pastor of a Pentecostal church in Boston. ""I tell my family I am in good health and in good spirits, but I have not taken my medicine since Friday, so I am a little tired."" Family members had previously said that Louis suffers from diabetes and they weren't sure if he had his medicine. Lisa Alphonse, a parishioner at another American church, said the group was ""treated really well."" Earlier Monday, a senior Egyptian government official told CNN that intelligence officers had visited with the alleged kidnapper, Germy Abu Masouh, on Friday and on Sunday, and communicated with him by phone. ""We saw the hostages, who seemed to be composed, but in a state of shock and fatigue from the grueling heat, especially Michel Louis, who said he had suffered a minor diabetic attack and avoids eating much,"" the official said before the hostages' release. Abu Masouh, a member of a prominent Bedouin tribe in the Sinai, had said he wanted Egyptian police to free his uncle, whom Bakr said had been caught in Alexandria, Egypt, with a half-ton of drugs. The two Americans and their guide were taken hostage Friday when gunmen boarded their tour bus, which was on its way to Israel, family members said. Louis offered himself as a hostage after gunmen took the female parishioner, his son, the Rev. Jean Louis, told CNN on Monday. ""Being the leader of the missionary group, my mom said that ... he stood up and he just asked that they leave the lady and take him. So this is why there's two people in addition to the translator detained right now somewhere in Egypt,"" he said. Michel Louis' wife was on the bus when the kidnapping occurred. The family was not aware of security concerns about travel across the Sinai, where Americans had been kidnapped and swiftly released in two separate incidents since February, Jean Louis said. ""If we were aware, I would believe we would use correct judgment not to enter that area,"" he said. Bakr earlier said the situation was ""partially the fault of the travel agency,"" which he said had not informed police of their route. If it had, ""we would have sent a police escort,"" he said. Authorities say the captives are still in the area where they were abducted. Kidnappings and armed robberies have increased since a popular uprising ousted Egypt's long-ruling dictator, Hosni Mubarak, last year. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz and Ed Payne contributed to this report.","NEW: ""I am in good health and in good spirits,"" Michel Louis says .

"London (CNN) -- A senior economist at the institution spearheading the bailouts of three eurozone countries has lambasted its lack of leadership and said its first female chief is not fit for the job. In a letter obtained exclusively by CNN and addressed to Shakour Shaalan, dean of the executive board of the International Monetary Fund, 20-year veteran Peter Doyle says he is ""ashamed to have had any association with the Fund at all."" Doyle, a former advisor to the IMF's European Department, which runs its programs for Greece, Portugal and Ireland, argues the body's failure to deliver timely and sustained warnings to the region's dithering politicians had led to widespread suffering for those living in stricken countries and the risk of worse to come. The institution's lack of decisive action, Doyle says, has left ""the second global reserve currency (the euro) on the brink."" ""The fund for the past two years has been playing catch-up and reactive roles in the last ditch efforts to save it,"" he writes. Read full letter here . Doyle, a former IMF division head for Israel and non-eurozone nations Sweden and Denmark, was widely respected within the organization, according to IMF insiders who did not wish to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. Doyle did not work on countries within the monetary union, but his comments highlight strong feelings among the fund's economists about its work underway in places like Greece. His attack comes amid concerns the fund's stringent austerity measures for debtor nations are doing more harm than good whilst failing to contain a crisis that is now well into its third year. Doyle penned his missive on June 18 just as senior IMF representatives, including its first female Managing Director, Christine Lagarde, were trying to hammer out a new set of emergency measures with key eurozone heads of government at the Group of 20 summit in Los Cabos, Mexico. Doyle says one of the reasons the IMF has not delivered on its surveillance of the global economy is European bias which if anything, he says, is ""becoming more deeply entrenched."" Lagarde: Euro crisis is 'everyone's problem' ""This fact is most clear,"" Doyle states, ""in regard to the appointments for Managing Director, which over the past decade, have all-too-evidently been disastrous."" Referring to Lagarde -- who recently completed her first year in the role -- Doyle says, ""even the current incumbent is tainted, as neither her gender, integrity, or elan can make up for the fundamental illegitimacy of the selection process."" Doyle, who copied in Stanley Fischer, governor of the Bank of Israel, and Stefan Ingves, head of the Sweden's central bank, says his early warnings of the impending crisis were ""identified well in advance but were suppressed."" William Murray, a spokesman for the IMF in Washington, said the fund had found no evidence to substantiate that claim, from Doyle or any other sources. Doyle went on to accuse the IMF's board of preferring a ""handicapped fund"" paralyzed by the powerplay of international politics within its upper echelons and ""subject to those proximate roots of surveillance failure."" ""There are good salty people here,"" Doyle signs off, ""but this one is moving on. You might want to take care not to lose others."" The IMF's Murray says, ""A lot of the points raised are covered by a host of public reports related to the IMF's economic surveillance and public statements by the management on these issues.""","A former IMF economist blasts the fund for its lack of leadership .

"(CNN) -- The family of the man authorities say was dismembered by a Canadian porn actor called for the suspect's quick extradition Tuesday and expressed hope that their ""devastating situation"" could become something positive. Jun Lin, a 33-year-old student at Montreal's Concordia University, was killed in late May in one of the city's grisliest crimes in years. The suspect in his killing, Luka Rocco Magnotta, is being held in Germany while Canadian prosecutors seek his return. ""Jun Lin was our beloved son. As the only son in the family, he was our pride and hope,"" his family said in a written statement issued Tuesday. His killing ""is not only a devastating attack to our family, but also has had a tremendous impact on the whole society. Love and trust must be rebuilt."" The family traveled from a village in China last week to reclaim their son's remains -- parts of which had been mailed to the headquarters of Canada's Conservative and Liberal parties and to two schools in Vancouver, on the Pacific coast. Other parts, including his head, are still missing. The family thanked the people of Montreal, who stepped up to support their travel; and Concordia, which has set up an award in their son's name to assist Chinese students -- a move the family said ""perfectly reflects Jun Lin's compassionate spirit."" ""We are very grateful and moved by the kindness and sympathy for us,"" they said. ""It is our wish to take this opportunity to turn a devastating situation into something positive that brings the goodness and peace back to society. ""We are calling for the extradition of the murder suspect back to Canada as soon as possible in order to bring justice and peace to our family, the Chinese community and the whole society,"" they said. ""To commemorate Jun Lin, please let us remember his kindness, diligence and love for life."" Police say they believe Magnotta killed and dismembered Lin and posted a 10-minute video of the slaying online. Montreal police Cmdr. Ian Lafreniere said the video shows Magnotta engaged in sexual acts involving body parts and included evidence of cannibalism. Investigators have said the suspect and victim knew each other, though they have not defined the nature of their relationship. The mailings and the discovery of other body parts behind Magnotta's apartment triggered an international manhunt. German authorities nabbed him June 4 in Berlin, where they said he had been spotted browsing online articles about himself at an Internet cafe.

"(CNN) -- In the slums of the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, visiting the bathroom usually means one of two things; a trip to the local pit latrine or the 'flying toilet'. The former entails letting nature take its course in a rickety outhouse perched atop a hole in the ground -- a facility also used by hundreds of other people in the neighborhood. The latter meanwhile consists of relieving oneself in a plastic bag before throwing the offending item away in the street. A 2011 report by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation found that these arrangements led to environmental contamination and the spread of diseases such as typhoid and tuberculosis. See also: How human waste could power Nigeria's slums . But within this primitive sewage system recent MIT graduate, David Auerbach, has spied an opportunity he believes could one day be worth millions of dollars. Alongside a group of fellow MIT alumni and local Kenyan partners, Auerbach has helped found Sanergy -- a start-up that aims to make a business out of cleaning up Nairobi's sanitary mess. It plans to collect human waste in a series of custom-built toilets before transforming it into compost and fertilizer products that can be sold to the local agriculture industry. ""In Kenya alone there are 10 million people who live in the slums and 8 million of them don't have access to a clean toilet,"" says Auerbach. ""By providing this service we believe there is tremendous potential to operate a for-profit social business. In terms of agriculture, Mckinsey puts (fertilizer) at a half trillion dollar business in East Africa alone,"" he adds. The Sanergy model works by first installing a network of low cost sanitation centers, which provide access to clean toilets, at various locations in the slums. These premises -- that trap the waste in air tight containers -- are then franchised out to local entrepreneurs at a cost of 45,000 shillings (roughly $500) a year, with a renewal fee charged to continue after this period. Franchisees are funded primarily by micro-finance loans, explains Auerbach. They charge residents a small fee, usually 5 Kenyan Shillings ($0.06) to use their facilities in order to make their money back. See also: Mobile solutions for better sanitation . The waste is processed and broken down to be transformed into a variety of organic fertilizer products that are then sold on to commercial farms. ""Currently we have 25 facilities up and running... we're collecting about three metric tons of waste per week which can all be converted into fertilizer,"" says Auerbach. ""By the end of this year we want to have 250 franchises. We think by the end of the following year we can safely be at 1,000 toilets,"" he adds. Creating employment opportunities for local residents can also be a benefit of the project and important to its greater success. ""Success of the business model like Sanergy depends on creating viable franchise opportunities for local entrepreneurs and attractive services for slum residents,"" says Austin Beebe of African Medical and Research Foundation. ""Projects such as these should hire locally and this is more than a good development principle. It makes business sense too."" See also: Elephant poo power electrifies zoo . As it stands, Sanergy employs 42 people -- in facility design, waste collection, plant operation and management positions -- of which 34 are Kenyan. By the end of 2013 Auerbach says Sanergy plans to collect enough waste to power a bio-generator that can sell electricity back into the Kenyan national grid. ""The waste of 100,000 people generates about 1 gigawatt of power. So right now when we have 1,200 users every day we're not at a point where we can produce sufficient amounts of electricity,"" says Auerbach. ""This is something we'll be looking to do later this year or next year,"" he adds. ""But we're not quite there yet.""","The slums of Nairobi lack efficient and clean sanitation systems .

London (VBS.TV) -- On Saturday, Aug. 6, people gathered in Tottenham to protest the police shooting of a 29-year-old local man. It quickly escalated into riots, looting and arson. Those Tottenham riots have now inspired copycats. Early on Monday evening the whole city rose up against law and order. Shops were looted, huge buildings were burned, people were pulled from their cars and homes were invaded. All while our Parliament, London's mayor and Britain's prime minister were away on holiday. And now it's spreading, as Liverpool, Birmingham, Bristol and many other cities have burst into violence. The riots may have begun as a protest, but now they're just mindless and brutal, with gangs roaming the streets in balaclavas, wielding bats and bottles. We were filming as Monday's mob sparked into action after police stopped and searched two men in front of a nervous crowd in Hackney, London. Thirty minutes later, kids were tearing the street apart, smashing up opticians, sports shops, raiding supermarkets for ammo, attacking busses and looting a tree surgeon's van for wooden weapons. See the rest of Hackney: Systems Overload at VBS.TV . As the police have been overrun, most of the nation have submitted authority to the mob, with only East London's Hasidic, Muslim and Turkish communities beating the crowd back from shops and mosques. By Tuesday, many people were calling for the army to be deployed and a curfew to be brought in to combat the anarchy, but instead tonight the police were allowed to have a second go at controlling the streets. While only 6,000 cops were active on Monday, yesterday 16,000 police armed with rubber bullets greeted any would-be rioters in London. It was a tactic that paid off as the city became a ghost town, with only isolated disturbances. However, elsewhere in England it was a different matter. Manchester saw sustained looting by more than a thousand youths, cars were torched in Liverpool, and three men died in Birmingham after being hit by a car as they defended their mosque.","Police shooting of a man in London sparks protests that quickly turn violent .

"(CNN) -- Nearly a month has passed since a joint Honduran-U.S. drug raid fired upon a riverboat that survivors say was carrying civilians, not traffickers. Four were killed, including two pregnant women. The mission -- carried out aboard helicopters owned by the U.S. State Department and with support of Drug Enforcement Administration agents -- laid bare the reach of U.S. involvement in Honduran security missions, as well as its associated risks. The apparent error stirred some local outrage, but the sentiment did not spread to the capital. The Honduran government, publicly at least, has not reprimanded the United States for any role it may have had, or said anything about reconsidering its cooperation arrangement. It contrasts what is seen when civilians are killed in Pakistan, for instance, where tensions between the two nations are inflamed. Or, closer to home, imagine if Mexican security forces killed civilians in an operation with any level of U.S. support, said Christopher Sabatini, senior director of policy at the Americas Society/Council of the Americas. There would be people in the streets protesting and visible outrage, he said. The relatively muted reaction in Honduras to the May 11 incident in the country's Mosquitia region, reveals much about the Central American country's relationship with the United States and the dire security situation it faces, experts said. Honduras has the highest per capita homicide rate in the world; it was 82.1 per 100,000 residents in 2011. It is also becoming a hotspot for drug trafficking, as Mexican cartels push their operations south of their own border because of increased enforcement in their country. The boat shooting was part of the response to these problems. Hilda Lezama, the owner of the boat that was attacked, says she was transporting 13 passengers before dawn on the morning of May 11 on a river near the town of Ahuas, when the helicopters appeared overhead. Her boat was nearing the landing, and she had never had problems on this route in 26 years, so she didn't think anything when the dark was broken by lights from the choppers. In an instant, gunfire erupted and she jumped into the water. Her legs were hit. ""I don't know how to swim, but somehow I made it to shore,"" she recalled in a teleconference with reporters this week. ""I was swimming with God."" She held onto a branch in the water for three hours before help arrived, she said. The next thing she remembered she was in the hospital. The State Department this week said a preliminary investigation by Honduran authorities found that their security forces were justified in firing in self-defense. There was anger from the local population after the shooting, but it did not manifest itself at the national or international level. The New York Times detailed how, instead, local residents burned down four houses believed to belong to local drug traffickers. ""My sense is that Hondurans are finding themselves in a desperate situation and they really want U.S. cooperation, and that gives the U.S. some margin to make mistakes,"" said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue. Despite how worrying it is that an enforcement operation may have killed innocent civilians, the fact remains that Honduras is confronting a very violent time, he said. That said, even the Hondurans have their limits, and the incident should serve a warning to the United States. ""I think the U.S. will be well-advised to be very careful. This should be an alarm,"" Shifter said. serious review and accountability needed ""There has to be a much greater sense of accountability."" Thus far, the U.S. government has downplayed its role in the shooting. The DEA was involved, but only in a supporting role, agency spokeswoman Dawn Dearden said. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland emphasized that the agents did not use force. ""No U.S. personnel fired any weapons. We were involved purely supporting and advising,"" she said. Still, the type of cooperation between the U.S. and Honduras is unprecedented in some ways. Unlike other U.S. anti-drug aid, like Plan Colombia, there does not appear to be the same strict limits on the role of American agents, Sabatini said. Honduras has ""always been a strong security partner of the United States, and a willing one,"" he said. The soft reaction to the Ahuas shooting boils down to a contradiction of Hondurans' situation, said Eduardo Gamarra, professor of politics and international relations at Florida International University. Militarizing the war on drugs raises the possibility of civilians being killed, but at the same time, citizens wants security above all, he said. ""There is a very, very high possibility that errors will occur, mistakes are going to happen, and we will kill civilians,"" he said. But, ""what average citizens in Honduras want is to be safe."" It's a contradiction that he sees across the region. ""People distrust the police, but they want more police,"" he said.","Witnesses say a joint Honduran-US drug raid killed civilians .

Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- Ask any Italian what pops into their head when they think of Naples, and you'll almost assuredly get the same three things every time: pizza, garbage in the streets and the most powerful international crime syndicate in the world -- the Camorra. In the past 30 years, this organization rose to be valued at around 10% of the aggregated wealth of the Italian nation. The Camorra not only deals in illegal activities such as drugs and weapons trafficking, contraband and extortion, but additionally controls a huge amount of legal, straight businesses -- especially in transport, construction and waste management, as well as in pretty much any economic sphere in which they find an opportunity to invest. It is relentlessly capitalistic, has destroyed an entire city and is probably the largest criminal emergency in Europe. It is certainly the biggest organization in the southern Italian criminal underground. Within this reality, one distinctive music genre rose to prominence over the last two decades: neomelodics. Neomelodic music is a strange mixture of techno, pop, Latin American music and traditional Neapolitan love songs. It's an entirely singular and totally bizarre form of music that, its detractors and critics say, is generally performed by nothing more than ex-criminals who have become Camorra minstrels. See the rest of Neapolitan neomelodics at VBS.TV . Bred in the Camorra-ridden, corrupt and generally all-around despairingly sad working-class underbelly of Naples, this army of singers tells stories of love found and lost, the crime that surrounds them, dreams of success and escape and running away from the law. Ranging in age from 8 to 80, the neomelodics play up to 700 gigs in a year, including weddings and birthday parties, sometimes the biggest events in a Neapolitan's life. Although they are hugely popular in their community, they often dream of entering the music charts on a national level, but their association to the Camorra has kept them from the mainstream. Perhaps this next generation of Neomelodic singers is about to change all of that.","Music genre known as neomelodics emerges from the Camorra crime syndicate .

Kelley Hardwick, 46, filed the employment discrimination lawsuit Monday in New York Supreme Court in Manhattan, alleging that coach Geno Auriemma followed her to her hotel room, grabbed her arm and tried to kiss her during a 2009 tournament trip to Russia with the women's senior national team. Auriemma called the allegations ""beyond false,"" pledging to defend himself ""to the fullest,"" in a statement to CNN. ""I'm confident that the truth will ultimately prevail,"" he said in the statement delivered by USA Basketball. ""In the meantime, I remain focused on representing the United States this summer and getting our team ready to compete for the gold medal."" Hardwick, a former New York City detective and law school graduate, said she pushed the coach away and reported the incident, but said nothing was done, according to the lawsuit. ""What are you doing?"" the lawsuit says Hardwick yelled at Auriemma during the alleged encounter. ""You better check yourself before you get hurt!"" ""After being rebuffed (Auriemma) red-faced, turned and walked quickly back in the direction of the elevators,"" according to the lawsuit. Later, she said Auriemma began to ""act vindictively towards her"" and demanded that the National Basketball Association relieve her of her travel assignments with the squad, according to the lawsuit. She was ultimately told in March that she would not be overseeing security during this summer's Olympics, the lawsuit said. ""Having received no prior complaints regarding performance of her (USA Basketball) related duties, (Hardwick) was convinced ... Auriemma had exercised his influence through USAB and the NBA to retaliate against her for rejecting his prior sexual advance and causing him embarrassment and discomfort with her continued presence,"" the lawsuit said. Auriemma, 58, told The New York Times that prior to reviewing media reports, he had been ""unaware of this lawsuit."" Hardwick further alleges in the suit that she has been routinely discriminated against by the NBA, claiming she was denied promotions and raises because she is a woman, despite an extensive resume of experience, including working as a security official for the U.S. Olympic teams that competed in Athens in 2004 and in Beijing in 2008. ""It's baffling why she, a trained and experienced security director, would be removed from this assignment with two Olympics under her belt,"" said Hardwick's attorney, Randolph McLaughlin. The NBA , which was also named in the lawsuit, could not be reached for comment on the allegations. Ron Howard, a spokesman for the Women's National Basketball Association, said his office does ""not comment on pending legal matters."" As it is our policy not to discuss pending legal matters, we will have no further comment while this case is active."" USA Basketball said in a statement that ""it is our policy not to discuss pending legal matters."" ""We will have no further comment while this case is active,"" it said. Auriemma, who is also head coach of the University of Connecticut women's basketball team, is considered among the nation's top coaches, steering the Huskies to seven national titles over his 27 years with the team. He was named coach of the U.S. national team in 2009, having been an assistant coach to the gold medalist 2000 team that competed in Sydney, Australia. The University of Connecticut was not available for comment regarding the lawsuit. CNN's Rose Arce, Kristina Sgueglia, Nina Ibarra and Khara Lewin contributed to this report.","Kelley Hardwick, 46, filed a lawsuit on Monday in state Supreme Court in Manhattan .

"(EW) -- Daniel Tosh isn't the sort of comedian who typically apologizes for anything. His hit Comedy Central series ""Tosh.0"" frequently explores potentially offensive territory with jokes that some would consider misogynistic or racist, and that his fans find hilarious. But it seems Tosh firmly strayed over the line during a recent live appearance. The comedian tweeted an apology and a link to a blogger's account of his recent stand-up performance. ""All the out of context misquotes aside, I'd like to sincerely apologize,"" Tosh wrote. The original anonymous ""friend of a friend"" account would be too sketchy to use for a source if not for Tosh's tweet acknowledging there is some substance to it. So keeping in mind that Tosh says he was misquoted, the original account was by a female audience member who says she was unfamiliar with Tosh's act when she caught his performance at the Hollywood Laugh Factory. She claims, ""Tosh [started] making some very generalizing, declarative statements about rape jokes always being funny, how can a rape joke not be funny, rape is hilarious."" The audience member felt ""provoked"" and says she yelled out, ""Actually, rape jokes are never funny!"" Continues the account: ""After I called out to him, Tosh paused for a moment. Then, he says, 'Wouldn't it be funny if that girl got raped by like, 5 guys right now? Like right now? What if a bunch of guys just raped her...' and I, completely stunned and finding it hard to process what was happening but knowing I needed to get out of there, immediately nudged my friend, who was also completely stunned, and we high-tailed it out of there ... I should probably add that having to basically flee while Tosh was enthusing about how hilarious it would be if I was gang-raped in that small, claustrophobic room was pretty viscerally terrifying..."" Tosh tweeted: ""The point I was making before I was heckled is there are awful things in the world but you can still make jokes about them,"" then added: ""On a lighter note tonight's new episode of Tosh.0 will be featuring clowns.""

"(CNN) -- A missed three-pointer by Russell Westbrook in the final minute of Sunday's game signaled the end of a fierce back-and-forth between the Miami Heat and Oklahoma City Thunder in game three of the 2012 NBA Finals. The shot, which could have tied the game and 88 all, led to a fast break and free throws from the Heat, who went on to win 91-85. The Heat now lead two games to one in the best of seven series. The two teams battled closely all night, entering the second half with a one-point Miami lead, 47-46. However, the Thunder weren't able to fight back after the Heat went on a six-point run with only three minutes remaining in the game. Westbrook said the game, which was played in Miami, wasn't about one play or series of plays but rather a lot of small mistakes. ""Just little things ... giving them easy layups,"" Westbrook told reporters after the game. ""We've got to cut that down."" However, Oklahoma City's final minutes were marred with sloppy play. In addition to Westbrook's missed shot, forward Kevin Durant missed a short jumper and guard Thabo Sefolosha turned the ball over. ""We turned the ball over in that second half too many times,"" Oklahoma City coach Scott Brooks said. ""They made some plays down the stretch that we did not make."" Miami forward LeBron James, who lead the game in points and rebounds with 29 and 14 respectively, had several key defensive rebounds leading up to the final buzzer. ""That's one thing I'm proud of. Last year I didn't make enough game-changing plays,"" James said. ""I'm just trying to step up and be there for my teammates."" Despite foul trouble late in the game, Durant had a team-high 25 points and remained positive going into the rest of the series. ""Unfortunately I get a lot of fouls called on me but I have to play through it,"" Durant said. ""Hopefully next game I will play smarter and get fewer fouls."" One point where the teams were decidedly unmatched Sunday night was on free throw shots. The Heat racked up 31 points from the line, while Oklahoma City managed just 15. Forward Chris Bosh for the Heat, credits his team's aggressiveness for the volume of free throw attempts. ""Being aggressive. That's what we want to do,"" Bosh told reporters. ""We want to put pressure to the rim."" Game four tips off Tuesday night in Miami.","The Miami Heat defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 91-85 Sunday night .

AMC Theatres . The company said it is reinforcing security procedures with its theater teams. It will not permit guests in costumes that make others uncomfortable, nor will it allow face-covering masks or fake weapons, AMC said in a news release. Though it declined to provide exact details of what it was doing, citing security concerns, the company said it is working with local law enforcement agencies, its landlords and security teams to ""ensure we provide the safest environment possible for our guests."" Los Angeles . After the Colorado shooting, Los Angeles police dispatched officers to major venues where ""The Dark Knight Rises"" was playing. The Aurora, Colorado, theater was screening the new Batman film when the gunman opened fire. The department said it will increase officers at area theaters and other places where large crowds gather.

Shootings cast pall over 'Dark Knight Rises' blockbuster weekend . Dallas . The Dallas Police Department instructed its patrol officers to provide ""extra visibility"" at public locations, like movie theaters, where large groups of people gather, it said in a release. The department also told them to be extra vigilant at such locations, stressing that police in the Texas city have been trained on what to do in a situation like the one that unfolded in Colorado. In Aurora, the agonized seek answers through faith . New York City . Police were posted at more than three dozen New York City theaters showing ""The Dark Knight Rises."" The NYPD said it was not responding to any specific threat; rather, it was hoping to prevent copycats. ""We're just concerned that someone perhaps seeking notoriety will attempt to do something similar,"" said New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. ""We always hear that when a high-profile event happens, so we're doing this to sort of raise the comfort level of people who are going to the movies."" Theater shooting unfolds in real time on social media . Tampa, Florida . ""In an abundance of caution,"" police in Tampa will increase patrols around theaters, the department said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- A former medical technician was arrested Thursday in connection with a hepatitis C outbreak at a hospital in Exeter, New Hampshire, a federal prosecutor announced. David Matthew Kwiatkowski, 32, is accused of infecting at least 30 people when he worked in the cardiac catheterization lab (CCL) at Exeter Hospital. He also is suspected of stealing controlled substance Fentanyl, a powerful anesthetic that is substantially more potent than morphine. According to an affidavit filed in federal court in New Hampshire, Kwiatkowski is charged with obtaining controlled substances by fraud and tampering with a consumer product. He faces more than 20 years in prison if convicted. ""The evidence gathered to date points irrefutably to Kwiatkowski as the source of the hepatitis C outbreak at Exeter Hospital. With his arrest, we have eliminated the menace this 'serial infector' posed to public health and safety,"" said United States Attorney John P. Kacavas. Multiple employees at the hospital said Kwiatkowski exhibited suspicious behavior, according to the federal affidavit. He would leave the CCL during procedures, sweating profusely, and attended procedures on his off days, according to the affidavit. On several occasions syringes were discovered in a restroom in the vicinity of the CCL, the affidavit said. Charges added for Colorado hospital worker in hepatitis case . One witness even said that she thought Kwiatkowski ""was on something"" and unfit for patient care. Another co-worker said he remembered an incident when Kwiatkowski was red in the face and eyes and had white foam around his mouth while he was on duty. Hepatitis C is passed through contact with contaminated blood, most often via shared needles, and is considered to be among the most serious of hepatitis viruses. It is typically asymptomatic, going undetected until liver damage shows up, according to the Mayo Clinic website. Prior to working in New Hampshire, Kwiatkowski was a traveling medical technician who worked on a contract basis in at least six other states. Gary Stephenson, a spokesman for Johns Hopkins Medicine, confirmed that Kwiatkowski worked at the hospital in Baltimore from July 2009 to January 2010. Kwiatkowski, who is originally from Michigan and has hepatitis C, was arrested in an undisclosed Massachusetts hospital where he is being treated and will be held in custody once he is discharged. It wasn't immediately clear whether he had legal representation. Kwiatkowski told authorities that he found out he had hepatitis C in May 2012, but further investigation revealed he tested positive for the disease in June 2010. A statement released by the hospital states that pre-employment drug testing and standard and criminal background checks were performed before he was hired. ""It is deeply disturbing that the alleged callous acts of one individual can have such an impact on so many innocent lives. As a result of his alleged actions, people in our community, who in many cases are the friends and neighbors of the 2,300 people who work here, now face the challenge of a potentially chronic disease,"" said Kevin Callahan, president and CEO of Exeter Hospital, in a released statement.

"(CNN) -- The love affair between BlackBerry devotees and their mobile communicators is becoming strained, and some of them made the quarrel very public this week after a service outage. Fans often discuss the intimate details about why they are attached at the hip to smartphones made by Research in Motion -- the clack-clack of the tiny keys, the feel of the trackball or square pad on their thumbs, the informative indicator light calling out for attention. They affectionately call it the ""CrackBerry."" After the recent outage, which RIM says was caused by a server error, some longtime BlackBerry users are writing goodbye letters on blogs, and on message boards operated and frequented by the CrackBerry collective. Richie, a British member of a Web forum called CrackBerry, summed up the concerns, saying RIM has been ""chipping away our faith"" in the company's ability to satisfy customers. In interviews with reporters, RIM executives issued apologies, which they also made public in a recorded video, but they avoided questions about whether they planned to offer incentives as compensation for the millions of customers affected by the outage. RIM did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter. By comparison, after Sony restored its network this summer following a lengthy outage, the company compensated users of its subscription service, and gave free games and movie rentals to all users. Netflix has offered small discounts to customers affected by technical troubles. Despite RIM's lack of public comment, an AT&T customer in Cleveland wrote on the CrackBerry message boards that he received a credit on his bill when he called to complain about the outage. RIM customers still holding onto their faith in the company should pay close attention to a conference being held in San Francisco next week. The pressure on BlackBerry from competitors is mounting, and RIM's promised next-generation models, with dual-core processors and large touchscreens, are overdue. A CrackBerry forum member, posting under the alias N8star, says he is giving up his BlackBerry Torch 9850 ""after years of being treated like a battered spouse by RIM,"" he wrote. His wife urged him to switch to an iPhone, and he says he will acquiesce. Jim Kerstetter, the executive editor for technology website CNET, published an editorial on Thursday titled ""RIM, you're dead to me now."" He writes that he has defended BlackBerry, despite the lack of multimedia features, but that the recent outage has spurred him to switch phones and operating systems. RIM still has a comfortable hold on corporate buyers, who snap up large orders for employees. Security experts tend to trust BlackBerry more than other smartphone platforms. However, even tech departments in companies are becoming more lenient on this policy. David Hurst, who was waiting in line to buy an iPhone 4S for his wife at a store in Atlanta, said her company ""has finally approved for her to switch from BlackBerry to iPhone, and her BlackBerry is just falling apart."" In the now crucial mobile-consumer market, Google and Apple both lead BlackBerry in sales, a trend expected to continue into the crucial holiday shopping season. A combined 69% of smartphone buyers say they plan to get either an Android phone or iPhone, while only 8% indicated that BlackBerry was at the top of their shopping lists, according to an NPD study from this summer. RIM is ""struggling to compete against Apple and Android,"" NPD analyst Linda Barrabee said in a phone interview. ""The outage comes at a really opportune time. ... You've got, during the same week, the availability of the iPhone 4S."" Among the dedicated Apple followers who lined up outside stores around the world to buy the new iPhone on Friday, some reluctant people waiting at stores told CNN that they were there because they believed BlackBerry was too far behind the technological curve. Outside the Apple Store in Los Gatos, California, a few spots behind Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak in line, Karol McBrian held a spot for her son. She is a longtime BlackBerry user, but she said she is changing allegiances. She will be inheriting her son's iPhone 4. Teresa Sparks, a 41-year-old nurse in Atlanta, waited in a line across the country from McBrian to buy her iPhone, which will replace a BlackBerry. She is especially excited about Siri, the voice-assistant technology that Apple has promoted heavily. ""I don't know who made it; I don't care,"" she said. ""I just want the personal assistant.""

"(CNN) -- In accepting the Nobel Peace Prize last year, Yemeni activist Tawakkol Karman thanked women of the Arab world for her medal. Without their struggle to win equal rights, she would not be there, she said. The greatest challenge in that quest is not religion but the lack of economic and social development and a dearth of perceived security, said a Gallup Poll released Monday. ""The idea that coming in with a secular liberal social program as the solution to fixing how societies view women isn't supported by the evidence,"" said Dalia Mogahed, executive director of the Gallup Center for Muslim Studies. She said the women in the Middle East have very much the same priorities as women in America. They want to lead prosperous lives. ""The research shows that human development and overall education and economic empowerment are the most important interventions we can make to help women's rights,"" Mogahed said. Mideast women beat men in education, lose out at work . The Gallup report urged policymakers to allow Arab women's own priorities to guide efforts at gender equality. Gallup conducted multiple surveys of 1,000 people each time in Egypt, Bahrain, Syria, Tunisia, Yemen and Libya. The data was collected between 2009 and 2011, before the the escalation of violence in Syria this year. In Libya, the surveys began in February 2010 and were restricted to eastern cities and did not include Tripoli. The survey found that both women and men rate their lives worse now than it was before the Arab Spring but believe they will be better in five years. The exception was in Egypt, where women and men rated their futures higher now than under Hosni Mubarak. A majority of women in Arab nations said they should have equal legal rights and equal access to education and employment. A majority of men, though smaller, agree, Gallup found. The biggest divide was in Tunisia, where 87% of women and 59% of men say women and men should have the same legal rights, ""which is surprising because it is often hailed as the most progressive Arab state on gender issues,"" Gallup said. Also surprising, perhaps, was that Arab women were as likely as their male counterparts to favor sharia or Islamic law as a source of new legislation. In Egypt, where the once-banned Muslim Brotherhood dominated parliament before it was dissolved, women and men expressed similar support for Islamist parties and movements. ""The current fear of the rise of Islamists is important and we need to address that,"" Mogahed said. ""So we attempted to look at how women feel about religion. There isn't a gender divide."" The Gallup report said male employment and education are linked to more progressive views of women's rights and how men view the role of religion in society had no correlation to their views on gender equality. Among Arabs who said religion is important, 69% supported divorce initiated by a wife. Among those who did not consider religion important, only 49% supported such divorce. However, Arab women differ on religion depending on where they are, Gallup found. In Egypt, women are more likely to support an Islamist candidate, for instance, than women in Tunisia, which for years has been a secular state. Dalia Ziada, who heads a policy research center in Cairo, believes gender equality has to come from political leadership. What's next for women in the Middle East? ""Women's rights will change from the top down. It will not change from grassroots up,"" said Ziada, executive director of the Ibn Khaldun Center for Development Studies. ""It's a grassroots movement that has been calling for freedom an economic rights but it did not call for women's rights,"" she said of the revolutionary movement in Egypt. She agreed that economic prosperity and education are top priorities for Egyptian woman but the main challenge for women is to become an essential part of the decision-making process. Ziada spoke from experience. The 30-year-old activist and blogger marched in the Tahrir Square protests that ousted Hosni Mubarak, but when she ran for parliament last fall on the liberal Justice Party ticket, her male colleagues refused to let her head the ticket, which meant her chances of winning votes were lower. They told her a woman could not win many votes, she said. She lost the election. ""Men don't envision democracy with women in it,"" said Ziada. ""They say, go back home. It's not your time yet."" Gallup said a third of the protesters in the Egyptian revolution were women but many, like Ziada, feel left out of the nation's transition to democracy. But Ziada, an observant Muslim, said she remains optimistic that the new president of Egypt will enact policies that empower women. ""That is the only way out,"" she said. Some of the transitional Arab governments have recognized women's participation in fomenting change. The Gallup survey said Tunisia required half of each party's electoral list to be made up of women in last fall's constituent assembly election. Women hold nearly 25% of the seats. The poll also raised another troubling issue for Arab women: safety. Women in all the countries surveyed said they feel less safe to walk alone at night after the revolution. The most significant drop was in Tunisia where 78% of women said they felt safe before the overthrow of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and only 30% said they were safe last fall. Women in Egypt have reported being sexually assaulted while protesting on the streets and there were accusations of rape and sexual violence used by Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi's forces during that country's rebellion. ""The greatest barrier to women's participation in public life may be their perception of lack of safety and respect,"" Gallup said. Ziada said she feels scared to be in crowds in Cairo. ""Sexual harassment is real problem that has been happening in Egypt for so long,"" she said. The Gallup report urged national leaders to address the perceived lack of safety ""to help increase women's confidence to participate in all aspects of life, including politics."" In her Nobel speech, Karman, had addressed many of the issues raised in Gallup's survey. ""The solution to women's issues can only be achieved in a free and democratic society in which human energy is liberated, the energy of both women and men together,"" she said. ""Our civilization is called human civilization,"" she said, ""and is not attributed only to men or women."" Who are Middle East's most influential women?","A new Gallup poll finds Arab women have the same priorities as women in America .
Economic and social development are key to gender equality .
A perceived lack of safety is also a stumbling block for women's participation .

"(CNN) -- It is an unwritten rule in soccer -- once you nail your colors to the mast you must never even think about switching allegiances. But for one diehard UK football fan, his disillusionment with his beloved club is so great he is offering his support to the highest bidder on eBay. ""With selling history and tradition the latest trend within football, I have decided to get on the bandwagon,"" writes lifelong Cardiff City fan Ben Dudley on his eBay page. The straw that broke the camel's back for Dudley was the decision by the Welsh team's Malaysian owners to rebrand the club by insisting they play in red rather than their traditional blue to boost their appeal to Asian audiences. So much so that Dudley is willing to trade his dedication to the Bluebirds' cause to whoever stumps up the most cash in the internet auction, whether it is Premier League champions Manchester City or lowly Ross County in the far north of Scotland. Can PSG's big bucks buy world football domination? ""It feels like the club have abandoned their local supporters,"" Dudley told CNN. ""While they play in red with a dragon on the badge I've had my season ticket refunded and I'm not going to go to anymore games until they've reversed the branding. ""I believe the board has thrown away the club's history on a gamble that is not guaranteed to make any money anyway. They don't understand the idea behind Cardiff being the Bluebirds and playing in blue. Cardiff have played in blue since 1908."" The rebranding move was met with outrage by supporters of the club, who play in the second tier of the English league, when it was announced last month. Cardiff's Malaysian owners said the marketing exercise was part of a significant investment package that would help secure the club's immediate financial future after a debt-laden few years and help broaden their appeal in ""international markets."" The club's chief executive Alan Whiteley acknowledged it would not be a universally popular plan and Dudley is living proof that resentment is still simmering. ""I've had a season ticket for the last nine years and I go to most away games as well so it wasn't something I have taken lightly, but the thought of watching Cardiff play in red at home wasn't something I could live with,"" he said. ""When the players come out or we score a goal we all chant 'Bluebirds' and obviously the bluebird has now been replaced by a dragon. ""The nickname is the Bluebirds but the team will now be playing in red. It will look silly, a stadium of blue seats, fans in blue shirts and a team playing in red."" But after following Cardiff the length and breadth of the country last season, when he watched his team in action 51 times, is he not apprehensive of the distance he might be required to travel to back his new team? ""It would be a bit of a trek up to Newcastle (some 322 miles away). I'm just hoping someone from Sydney FC doesn't see it and try to sign me up. ""A non-league team would be good but our local rivals Swansea and Bristol fans can't buy me -- anyone apart from that is fine."" The fan is dead, long live the phone? However, it's not just Cardiff's rebranding initiative that has upset Dudley. Aggrieved at the change football has undergone in recent years, with the huge amounts of money sloshing around the game through TV and sponsorship deals leading to exorbitant wages for players and a big increase in foreign owners, Dudley argues the sport is unrecognizable from the game he started to follow as a teenager. ""I wasn't around in the 1970s or 1980s but people who knew football at that time wouldn't be able to recognize the sport now and see the wages players are on. It's not the sport I loved when I was 14 and started to go to Cardiff games,"" he added. ""Fans aren't really the priority in football anymore; it is all about money and trying to make money from TV deals. I think (the owners) are trying to get a TV deal in Malaysia to show all our games as part of the whole making Cardiff the team of choice for Malaysia. ""They said the color red is marketable in Asia, they think Asian fans and Malaysian fans won't care about Cardiff in a blue shirt but if they play in red at home they will suddenly take Cardiff as their team instead of Real Madrid or Barcelona. It doesn't seem very likely to me."" Bidding for Dudley's football soul is currently running at over $300, which has come as something of a shock to him. ""With the price going far beyond anything I had expected, this is now a full charity auction. 50% will go to Help for Heroes charity and 50% to the Ty Hafan charity. The only money I will take from this auction is enough to pay the eBay fees.""","Disillusioned football fan offers his support for next season in auction on eBay .

"Paris (CNN) -- Three Americans died when a private jet crashed at a small airport in the south of France, a local official said Friday. Two men, ages 24 and 51, and a 30-year-old woman were on board the plane when it crashed at Castellet airport, said Didier Couve, a spokesman for the Prefecture of the Var department. The three were the only people on the plane, Couve said. The airplane, a Gulfstream IV, belonged to Universal Jet Aviation, a charter company with three U.S. locations and one in London.

"(CNN) -- This week, health care professionals and scientists from around the world met in Vancouver to present the latest cutting-edge research on Alzheimer's disease for the annual Alzheimer's Association International Conference. There was a lot of buzz about new studies, including drug advancements that could be potential treatments in the future. But for the average patient with Alzheimer's, or for their caregivers, it's easy to get lost in the abundance of abstracts and scientific minutia. The ravages of the disease -- memory loss, mood swings, depression and poor judgment, to name just a few -- not only affect the 5.4 million Americans with Alzheimer's but also the 15 million-plus unpaid men and women who care for them. Symptoms of the disease can manifest themselves differently in each patient, but ultimately most people living with Alzheimer's will end up unable to function independently. They will have to rely on spouses, siblings, children, friends, neighbors or paid professionals for help. ""Alzheimer's disease is really difficult for everybody, and families can really struggle,"" said Beth Kallmyer, vice president of constituent services at the Alzheimer's Association. If you're a caregiver for someone with Alzheimer's, how can you use the information from the conference? Here are some takeaway messages: . The power of engagement . Mental and social stimulation are key for someone dealing with an Alzheimer's diagnosis. Experts have known for a while that remaining engaged in hobbies or social activities can fend off feelings of isolation and depression, both of which can further the disease's progression. One new study presented at the conference takes this knowledge a step further. Led by Dr. Jeffrey Kaye, researchers at Oregon Health & Science University tracked the amount of time 148 patients with mild cognitive impairment and with an average age of 84 spent outside their homes during a period upward of three years from when their activities were initially measured. Mild cognitive impairment increases a person's risk of developing Alzheimer's but does not guarantee someone will get the disease. Photos: The past and present of Alzheimer's patients . In the abstract, researchers found that participants with mild cognitive impairment ""had a greater decline in time out of home over time compared to cognitively intact patients."" Put another way, the people who were cognitively impaired eventually spent more time in their homes than the other participants did. More time at home translates to less outside stimulation, and presumably, more isolation and depression. For caregivers, this means two things. First, it's vital that a loved one's engagement in hobbies, social events, projects or community activities does not wane once he or she is diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's or any type of dementia. Second, if a loved one becomes withdrawn or starts to spend less time interacting in ways than he or she used to, it may be a sign of a larger problem. ""This study shows the importance -- from the very beginning of someone's diagnosis -- of staying engaged,"" Kallmyer said. ""It really makes a difference in their cognition and therefore their quality of life."" Resistance training can improve cognition . Exercise is one of the more promising things people at risk of developing dementia, or who have been diagnosed with it, can do to affect their cognition. But research presented at the conference suggests that not all exercise is created equal for maximum benefit in Alzheimer's patients. Lindsay Nagamatsu of the University of British Columbia and her team conducted a randomized, controlled trial comparing the effects of resistance training, aerobic activity and balance-and-tone training on cognition. Eighty-six women between the ages of 70 and 80 were divided into three groups -- one for each type of exercise -- and they worked out twice a week for six months. The women who had resistance training showed the greatest improvement on cognitive tests. Plus, the study found that resistance training ""led to functional changes in three regions of cortex involved in the encoding and memorization of nonverbal associations."" Aerobic exercise improved the women's balance and mobility and had a greater effect on their cardiovascular health. ""What that translates to for caregivers is that if a person doesn't have an exercise program, this is something to look in to,"" Kallmyer said. ""Exercise program"" can sound daunting, but Kallmyer said that even daily walks can help. It's as much about the physical benefit of exercise as it is about the structure it provides. ""It will make them feel less overwhelmed,"" Kallmyer said. ""If a person gets exercise, we know exercise may help them sleep better. The longer that patients can maintain that ability (to do things for themselves), the better for them, their self-esteem and their caregivers."" Alcohol and dementia don't mix . How alcohol affects the cognition of a person with dementia isn't completely understood, but four new studies presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference shed a little more light on their relationship. One study looked at binge drinking (defined as four or more drinks on one occasion) and followed more than 5,000 people ages 65 and older for eight years. Dr. Iain Lang of Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom led the study. He and his team found that participants ""who reported (binge drinking) once a month were 62% more likely to experience the greatest declines in cognitive function and were 27% more likely to be in the group experiencing the highest amount of memory decline."" Binge drinking twice a month more than doubles cognitive function decline (147%), and memory decline could increase more than fivefold (149%), according to Lang's study. Rare genetic mutation protects against Alzheimer's disease . Those are alarming numbers since patients with moderate or severe dementia can forget how many drinks they've consumed in a sitting, leading them to binge drink without realizing it. If you're caring for patients in that position, how do you stop them from drinking too much? Since each one is different, Kallmyer said instead of stopping the patient, caregivers need to reframe this question by thinking, ""What can I do to keep this person safe?"" For example, ensure the person doesn't wander off or can safely navigate a staircase, or don't let him or her drive. For patients asking for a glass of alcohol, Kallmyer recommends some distractions to keep them engaged so they forget about the drink for which they're asking. When it comes to medication, she said caregivers should learn about the disease so they can anticipate those situations and eventually take over the job of distributing pills. Caregivers also need to think about how drugs will interact with alcohol: ""Talk to his doctors -- what medications is he on? Can alcohol get in the way? You don't want him intoxicated; he's already impaired."" Kallmyer said one of the first steps to take when someone you love has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's or another type of dementia is ""to get educated about the disease. The more people can plan ahead of time, learn ahead of time, the better you can handle situations later."" To help you plan ahead, you can check out a tool from the Alzheimer's Association called the Alzheimer's Navigator. Caregivers must care for themselves, too . ""When you're in a caregiving role, it's hard to think about yourself,"" Kallmyer said. ""It's very, very common for people to say, 'This isn't about me.' ""But if you don't take care of yourself, you won't be around to continue to take care of your spouse, your mom, whoever it may be."" According to the Alzheimer's Association, 15.2 million Americans provide nearly 22 hours of unpaid care per person per week. That's the equivalent of a part-time job. Sixty-one percent of caregivers say the emotional stress of the job is ""high to very high,"" while 43% say the same about the physical stress. ""They're not getting enough sleep; they're not eating right; they're not getting enough exercise,"" Kallmyer said. Kallmyer said it's easy for people to lose touch with their social networks or to lose interest in old hobbies when they're juggling so much. That can lead to isolation, which can be just as dangerous for caregivers as it is for the people for whom they're caring. The Alzheimer's Association has a 24/7 help line for caregivers with questions. The number is 800-272-3900.","There are 15 million-plus unpaid Alzheimer's caregivers in U.S., Alzheimer's Association says .

"(CNN) -- Doctors' attempts to combat rare, aggressive bacteria that have infected a University of West Georgia graduate student have suffered a further setback: 24-year-old Aimee Copeland's remaining foot and both her hands were amputated, according to a blog on the school's website. Prior to the surgery, a website posting by Copeland's friend and fellow psychology student, Ken Lewis, explained the reason: ""Aimee's fingers and remaining foot will have to be amputated because of dead blood vessels, not because of necrotizing fasciitis,"" he wrote. Surgeons had already amputated a leg and cut out soft tissue from her torso. On a Facebook page dedicated to his daughter's recovery, Andy Copeland describes speaking with the surgeons before the latest amputations. ""The hands were endangering Aimee's progress,"" he writes. ""As always, my decision was simple. Do whatever it takes to give us the best chance to save Aimee's life."" He then broke the news to his daughter. ""I took Aimee's hands and held them up to her face. She didn't draw back in horror. She knew the condition she was in,"" he writes. She nodded as he explained the diagnosis given by her doctors. Asked whether she had any questions, his daughter mouthed, ""I'm a little confused, but I'll figure it out,"" he writes. The patient then listened as her father, mother Donna and sister Paige explained how she would eventually be fitted with prosthetic limbs. ""She smiled and raised her hands up, carefully examining them. She then looked at us. We all understood her next three words,"" he writes. "" 'Let's do this.' "" Andy Copeland then pays tribute to the strength of his daughter, who has spent days in intensive care at Doctors Hospital in Augusta, Georgia. ""A tear rolled down my face as I walked out of her room. I wasn't crying because Aimee was going to lose her hands and foot, I was crying because, in all my 53 years of existence, I have never seen such a strong display of courage. Aimee shed no tears, she never batted an eyelash. I was crying because I am a proud father of an incredibly courageous young lady."" Read the entire text of Andy Copeland's post . Aimee Copeland Facebook page . Copeland's struggle has been followed by many Americans as her family has shared the ups and downs of her battle against the ""flesh-eating"" bacteria. She was with friends May 1 near the Little Tallapoosa River, about 50 miles west of Atlanta, when she grabbed onto a zip line. It snapped, and she fell. The accident left a gash in her left calf that took 22 staples to close. Three days later, still in pain, she went to an emergency room, where doctors determined she had necrotizing fasciitis caused by the flesh-devouring bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila. She was flown to Augusta for the first of what has turned into a series of surgical procedures. Among them has been a tracheotomy. Copeland has been on life support since May 4, the school's website said. Her father recounts how her loved ones have watched as the disease attacked her flesh and seen the inevitability of the amputations in the changing color of her hands from day to day. ""Some people may criticize my decision and say we should have prayed over Aimee and asked God to heal her hands. Trust me, this we have done every day,"" he writes. Though there is uncertainty about just how common such infections are since no clearinghouse compiles statistics on their incidence, Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, estimates there are fewer than 250 cases every year in the United States. The reporting of such cases is not required by law. The infection is fatal in about one in four cases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says on its website. The bacteria are ""remarkably common in the water and in the environment,"" according to Dr. Buddy Creech, an assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University. ""When it gets into those deeper tissues, it has a remarkable ability to destroy the tissues that surround it in sort of this hunt for nutrition,"" he said. ""When it does that, those tissues die, and you see the inflammation and the swelling and the destruction that can be very difficult to control.""","Aimee Copeland's dad tells how he broke the news that her hands would be amputated .

"(EW) -- For the third time this year, following strong openings from ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Snow White and the Huntsman,"" a movie with a tough female protagonist topped the box office in a major way. Disney-Pixar's Brave was right on target in its debut weekend, opening to $66.7 million Ã¢â¬â the fifth-best debut ever for a Pixar film, and a faster start than last year's Cars 2, which opened with $66.1 million. Brave continued Pixar's streak of number one debuts, as all 13 of the studio's releases have reached the peak position during their first weekend of wide release. ""Girls kick butt,"" says Dave Hollis, Disney's EVP of distribution, about the rise of the female action protagonist at the 2012 box office. Still, he believes that gender had less to do with Brave's successful opening weekend than audiences' trust in Pixar. ""There's a universal love of this brand,"" he says, praising their ""consistency [as] classic storytellers."" Disney wisely marketed the film differently to boys and girls Ã¢â¬â much like the studio did when releasing another princess film, Tangled, in 2010. For that film, Disney created a campaign that focused as much on Tangled's humorous male character, Flynn Rider, as it did on the film's main character, Rapunzel. For Brave, Disney targeted males with ads that emphasized the film's rambunctious Scottish hijinks and mischievous red-headed triplets. Meanwhile, girls were targeted with ads that focused more on Brave's central character, Merida, and her quest to change her fate. Still, Hollis notes that there were numerous images that spoke to both males and females, such as shots of Merida riding her horse through the woods. Despite rather tepid reviews (compared to the rest of Pixar's catalog), the $185 million Scottish adventure earned an ""A"" CinemaScore grade from audiences, which were 57 percent female and 43 percent male. Thanks to good word-of-mouth, Brave will likely enjoy small declines over the ensuing weeks (although it will face direct competition when Ice Age: Continental Drift debuts on July 13), and if history is any indication, finish somewhere in the $200 million range. In second place, Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted dropped 41 percent to $20.2 million, giving DreamWorks' $145 million animated sequel a $157.6 million total after three weekends. The 1-2 finish of Brave and Madagascar 3 marks just the third time in the past decade that two animated films have taken up the top two spots at the box office. In November 2007, Beowulf and Bee Movie finished in first and second. In November 2004, The Incredibles and The Polar Express did the same. Worldwide, Madagascar 3 has already stampeded to $208.4 million. Interestingly, despite its European setting, the film has yet to open in the UK, Germany, and Italy (as well as Japan, Australia, and New Zealand). Paramount doesn't want to let Madagascar get overshadowed by the Euro Cup, which is currently diverting Europe's attention, or the upcoming Olympics in London. Fox's $69 million revisionist horror film Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter earned a decidedly un-presidential $16.5 million in its debut frame. The R-rated film, an adaptation of Seth Grahame-Smith's popular novel of the same name, drew crowds that were 56 percent male and 53 percent above the age of 25, according to Fox. Audiences weren't especially pleased with the film itself, issuing Honest Abe a harsh ""C+"" CinemaScore grade. Vampire Hunter's box office performance somewhat resembles the performance of Snakes on a Plane, which earned $13.8 million in its 2006 debut. Both efforts earned innumerable headlines for their absurdly straightforward, silly titles, but that early buzz didn't translate into substantial box office dollars. Audiences' interest peaked with the gimmicky title and concept, but they weren't actually invested in the film. Prometheus finished in fourth place in its third weekend, falling 52 percent to $10 million million. Ridley Scott's $130 million Alien prequel has earned $108.6 million domestically, and it will likely fall just short of matching its production budget domestically. Fortunately for Fox, the film has zapped up over $150 million internationally. Just like the film in first place, the film in fifth place, Snow White and the Huntsman, is centered on a warrior princess. The Kristen Stewart/Charlize Theron collaboration earned another $8 million over the weekend, a drop of 40 percent. The $170 million picture has now grossed $137.1 million domestically, and another $160.4 million million overseas. Notably, Warner Brothers' Rock of Ages also earned an estimated $8 million this weekend, so the two films may flip-flop when actuals come out on Monday afternoon. It was the end of the world for Focus Features' Seeking a Friend for the End of the World, which started its run way back in tenth place with only $3.8 million out of 1,625 theaters. The romantic dramedy, which stars Steve Carrell and Keira Knightley, was almost beaten by Focus' other current release, Moonrise Kingdom, which, in its fifth weekend, found $3.4 million out of just 395 theaters. Fortunately, Focus says that Seeking a Friend, which earned a weak ""C+"" Cinema Score grade, cost less than $10 million. In limited release, Midnight in Paris director Woody Allen's latest film, To Rome With Love, got off to a blazing start with $379,000 out of just 5 theaters, which yielded a remarkable $75,800 per theater average.

"(Tribune Media Services) -- Italy's Cinque Terre is a quintet of villages clinging to a bit of rugged coastline between Genoa and Pisa. Long cut off from the modern world, this remote chunk of the Italian Riviera only became easily accessible with the coming of the train. Boats are a way of life in Vernazza. Each village is a variation on the same theme: a well-whittled, pastel jumble of homes, filling a gully like crusty sea creatures in a tide pool. Locals are the barnacles -- hungry, but patient. And we travelers are like algae, coming in with the tide. Since my mind goes on vacation with the rest of me when I'm here, I think of the towns by number, east to west: no. 1 Riomaggiore (a workaday town), no. 2 Manarola (picturesque), no. 3 Corniglia (on a hilltop), no. 4 Vernazza (the region's dramatic cover girl), and no. 5 Monterosso al Mare (the closest thing to a beach resort). To preserve this land, the government has declared the Cinque Terre (CHINK-weh TAY-reh) a national park. For a small entrance fee (about $8 for a one-day pass), visitors can hike the trail connecting all five towns, a trek that takes about five hours. You can choose any village for a home base, but Vernazza is my favorite. At the top end of town a little road hits a post, effectively a dead end for drivers. Like the breakwater keeps out the waves at the bottom of town, the post keeps out the modern storm at the top. No cars enter this village of 600 people -- except on Tuesday morning, when a few cars and trucks show up for a tailgate-party street market, augmenting the meager business community. Vernazza has the only natural harbor in the Cinque Terre. In the Middle Ages, there was no beach or square. The water went right up to the buildings, where boats would tie up, Venetian-style. Vernazza's fishing fleet is down to just a couple of boats. Still, Vernazzans are more likely to own a boat than a car. Boats remain on buoys, except in winter or when the red storm flag indicates bad seas. In that case they're allowed to pull up onto the main square, usually reserved for restaurant tables. Vernazza has a humble little working beach -- a pebbled cove littered with scenes of a community that lives off the sea ... and travelers who love the views. Well-worn locals fill the benches while tourists sunbathe on rocks. In the summer, the beach becomes a soccer ground, where teams fielded by local bars and restaurants provide late-night entertainment. The town has two halves. Sciuiu (Vernazzan dialect for ""flowery"") is the sunny side on the left as you face inland, and luvegu (dank) is the shady side on the right. On the far right, a castle -- now just stones and a grassy park -- served as the town's lookout back in pirate days. Below the castle an interior arcade connected the houses -- ideal for fleeing attacks. These days, ""Ligurian pastel"" colors are regulated by a commissioner of good taste in the regional government. Vernazza's harbor-front church is unusual for its strange entryway, which faces east (altar side). Hanging on the wall inside are three historic portable crosses -- replicas of crosses that Vernazza ships once brought along on crusades to the Holy Land. During Easter processions, these crosses are taken down and carried through town. Located in front of the church, a tiny piazza -- decorated with a river rock mosaic -- is a popular hangout spot. It's where Vernazza's old ladies soak up the last bit of sun, and kids enjoy a patch of level ball field. Beyond the town, vineyards, with their many terraces, fill the mountainside. Someone -- probably after too much local wine -- calculated that the roughly 3,000 miles of terrace walls have the same amount of stonework as the Great Wall of China. Wine production is down nowadays, as younger residents choose less physical work. But locals still maintain their tiny plots and proudly serve their family wines. Evenings in Vernazza are well spent sitting on a bench and enjoying the scene, either with a gelato or a glass of local white wine (borrow the glass from a bar, they don't mind). Observe the passeggiata (evening stroll), as locals meander lazily up and down the main street doing their vasca (laps). Or gaze at the people looking out the windows of the faded pastel buildings, like a gallery of portraits hanging on ancient walls. Here in Vernazza the generation that didn't grow up with television spends time posted at their windows, watching over a world as reassuring as the Mediterranean tide.

"London (CNN) -- The British government will deploy an extra 1,200 troops for Olympics security, Sports Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced Tuesday. The 1,200 military personnel come on top of 3,500 already called up specially this month after security contractor G4S said it would not be able to supply the number of guards it promised. The new deployments bring the number of troops guarding the Olympics to 18,200, the government says. The Games begin Friday. The Ministry of Defence is deploying two warships, Typhoon fighter jets and Puma helicopters as part of their Olympics security arrangements. The army is also putting high-velocity missile batteries on the roofs of some apartment buildings in London, despite the objections of some residents. The government put the latest batch of troops on standby last week, amid the security fiasco caused by a contractor's failure to supply enough guards for the Games. Hunt said last Thursday that there was no need to deploy extra troops but that putting 1,200 on standby means they can be moved within 48 hours rather than seven days if required. He said then that G4S was showing progress in recruiting and accrediting staff. UK government downplays Olympics security snafu . The chief executive of G4S, Nick Buckles, faced a grilling last week by British lawmakers furious about the security situation. They forced him on July 17 to agree that the fiasco is ""a humiliating shambles."" Buckles said the company should not have agreed to provide 10,400 guards for the Olympics, six days after the security giant admitted it could not do so. ""We regret signing the contract,"" he said under pressure from lawmakers. Is Olympic-level security already under way in Britain? The company's failure forced the government to call in 3,500 extra military personnel to help. ""We are constantly reviewing the extent of the G4S shortfall and the military contingency force,"" the Home Office said before the extra 1,200 were deployed Tuesday. G4S has a ÃÂ£284 million ($444 million) government contract to provide security staff for the Olympic Games. As of his questioning by lawmakers a week ago, only 4,000 guards were trained and ready, he said. Buckles said there was a company ""expectation"" that 7,000 will be ready by the time the Games begin, although he called the exact number ""a moving target."" Guarding the games . Labour lawmaker David Winnick laid into Buckles, insisting several times that the snafu was ""a humiliating shambles."" Buckles finally said he could not disagree. The company will reimburse police forces that have to provide officers to cover for G4S shortfalls, and will ""consider"" paying bonuses to military and police who are called in to help, he said. The company accepts ""100% responsibility"" for its failure and is ""extremely grateful to the military and police for helping us out,"" Buckles said. Athletes fret on lost bus as Olympic arrivals begins . The G4S recruits are supposed to perform tasks including venue perimeter security, such as manning X-ray machines, searching people, searching vehicles and operating closed-circuit television systems, G4S said Sunday. G4S has said that it stands to lose up to $77 million after failing to recruit enough staff. See how Heathrow is preparing for the London Olympics .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The City Council of San Bernardino, California, is scheduled to vote late Wednesday on a resolution formally authorizing the filing of bankruptcy. The council, scheduled to meet at 5 p.m., is to consider first another resolution declaring a fiscal emergency. Last week, Interim City Manager Andrea Miller and Finance Director Jason Simpson issued a report stating that the city was facing insolvency and its expenditures are projected to exceed revenues by $45 million. The city's general fund reserves had been as high as $19 million in 2001 but are now depleted, the report said. Some $10 million to $16 million in annual revenue has evaporated in recent years as taxable sales dried up and property values plummeted in the city of 211,000 residents, the report said. San Bernardino is about 60 miles east of downtown Los Angeles. Prior agreements reducing city salaries are now ending, ""creating an increase in salaries and benefits of $10 million effective July 1, 2012, and increased costs in future years as merit increases resume,"" the report said. Despite negotiating tens of millions of dollars in concessions and reducing its work force by 20% over the past four years, San Bernardino would not have enough cash on hand to meet its obligations, according to the report. ""The city has reached a breaking point,"" the report said. Opinion: Can state governments step up? San Bernardino would be the third California city to file for bankruptcy in the past few weeks. Many municipalities in the Golden State and around the nation are struggling to cover their costs as the economic malaise continues to hurt tax revenue streams, experts said. This will lead to more municipal bankruptcies, which have been rare until now. ""This is not the end. This is the beginning,"" Peter Navarro, business professor at University of California, Irvine, told CNN recently. ""As cities see it can be done and is being done, it will give them the idea to do it."" The town of Mammoth Lakes, California, sought protection July 2 after a property developer won a $43 million court judgment against the resort town of just over 8,000 residents. Experts say this filing should not be lumped in with the other two California towns since it was an unusual circumstance. The city of Stockton, however, filed for bankruptcy in late June after three months of mediation with creditors failed to close a $26 million budget shortfall. The city of 292,000 residents had already addressed $90 million in deficits over the past three years, mainly through reducing services and employee compensation. Both Stockton's and San Bernardino's fiscal troubles are due in large part to the massive housing downturn and recession that swept across California. Both towns were hit particularly hard by the foreclosure crisis, which left numerous abandoned homes and reduced property values in its wake. That led to lower property tax revenues, critical to supporting public services. Also, municipalities have struggled from budget changes made on the state level. Because of massive budget shortfalls, Gov. Jerry Brown and the state legislature made changes to vehicle tax money allocation and redevelopment agencies that stripped locales of hundreds of millions in state funding. Governor signs high-speed rail bill . While some areas of the Golden State are starting to recover, the regions containing those two towns are not, said Chris McKenna, executive director of the League of California Cities. By filing for bankruptcy, cities will be able to keep police and firefighters on the street and possibly keep some parks and libraries open while they work out their finances, he said. More municipal bankruptcies are likely in California and throughout the nation, as cities continue to battle rising costs and a weak economy, said Eric Hoffman, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service. CNNMoney's Tami Luhby contributed to this report.","San Bernardino is scheduled to vote on declaring a fiscal emergency .

"(Tribune Media Services -- My ancestors came from Norway, so I'm partial to that corner of Europe. But even if you're not from Viking stock, don't miss the fjords. On the Sognefjord, Norway shows off its natural beauty. From Oslo, northern Europe's most scenic train takes you up and over the country's mountainous spine and into the land of shiplap dreams. The tourist board calls it ""Norway in a Nutshell"" and that's just what it gives you. Frankly, if you go to Oslo and don't get out to the fjords, you should have your passport revoked. Norway's greatest claim to scenic fame is its deep and lush saltwater inlets. Sognefjord, Norway's longest (120 miles) and deepest (more than a mile), is tops. Sognefjord offers Norway's best combination of scenic wonder and accessibility. For the best one-day look at fjords, follow the Nutshell's series of well-organized train, ferry, and bus connections that puts this beautiful fjord country spread-eagle on a scenic platter. Ambitious and energetic travelers can see the whole shebang in a day; with more time or less energy, consider an overnight along the fjord or in Bergen. Allow about $200 to take the Nutshell route from Oslo to Bergen on your own (cheaper if you have a railpass). Book your reservations for the train at least a week in advance (from the United States, dial 011-47-81 50 08 88). Or you can take a package tour with Fjord Tours for about the same price and less hassle. Sunny July and August are the best months to go. The Nutshell route starts with a spectacular train ride, leaving Oslo at about 8 a.m. for Bergen. Your camera button will click like a castanet as the train roars over Norway's mountainous spine. The barren, windswept heaths, glaciers, deep forests, countless lakes, and a few rugged ski resorts create a harsh beauty. The railroad is an amazing engineering feat. Completed in 1909, it's 300 miles long and peaks at 4,266 feet, which, at this Alaskan latitude, is far above the tree line. You'll go under 18 miles of snow sheds, over 300 bridges, and through 200 tunnels in just less than seven hours. At Myrdal, a 12-mile spur line drops you 2,800 breathtaking feet in 55 minutes to the village of Flaam on Sognefjord. This is a party train. The engineer even stops the train for photographs at a particularly picturesque waterfall. While most ""Norway in a Nutshell"" tourists zip immediately from the train onto the scenic fjord boat in Flaam, those with time enjoy an overnight stop on the fjord. Flaam is a handy tourist depot with several simple hotels. Aurland, a few miles north of Flaam, is more of a town. It's famous for producing some of Norway's sweetest ""geitost"" -- goat cheese. Aurland has as many goats as people (1,900). Nearly every train arriving in Flaam connects with a bus or boat to Aurland, also on Sognefjord. While nearby Bergen is famous for its rain -- more than six feet a year -- Sognefjord is a relative sun belt, with only two feet of rain a year. The train from Myrdal to Flaam is quite scenic, but the ride doesn't do the view justice. For the best single day's activity from Flaam, take the train to Berekvam (halfway back up to Myrdal), then hike or bike (rentable from the Flaam tourist office) the gravelly construction road back down to Flaam. Bring a picnic and your camera. From Flaam, ""Nutshellers"" catch the most scenic of fjord cruises. Sightseeing boats leave throughout the day. For 90 minutes, camera-clicking tourists scurry on the drool-stained deck like nervous roosters, scratching fitfully for a photo to catch the magic. Waterfalls turn the black-rock cliffs into a bridal fair. You can nearly reach out and touch the sheer, towering walls. The ride is one of those fine times, like being high on the tip of an Alp, when a warm camaraderie spontaneously combusts among the strangers who came together for the experience. The boat takes you up one narrow arm (Aurlandsfjord) and down the next (Naeroyfjord) to the nothing-to-stop-for town of Gudvangen, where waiting buses shuttle you back to the main train line at Voss. From Voss, carry on into Bergen for a short evening visit. Bergen, Norway's second city and historic capital, is an entertaining place. You can finish the day there by browsing the touristy but fun wharf area, or zipping up the funicular to the top of 1,000-foot-tall ""Mount"" Floyen for city and fjord views. Then spend the night in Bergen -- or, for maximum efficiency, catch the overnight train back to Oslo. Back in Oslo's station, as you yawn and stretch and rummage around for a cup of morning coffee, it'll hit you: You were gone for 24 hours, experienced the fjord wonder of Europe, and saw Bergen to boot.

"(CNN) -- The execution of Najiba, an Afghan woman in her 20's, shot 13 times in front of a cheering crowed in Parwan province -- and seen widely online in a grainy cell phone video -- is a show of confidence by the Taliban. It's unclear why she was shot, but local officials offer various reasons for her execution. She was reportedly executed last month for adultery, a crime that is indeed punishable in Islam. But for an adultery charge to be proved, Islam requires four eyewitness accounts that match precisely. This is nearly impossible in cultures like Najiba's, where sexual acts are extremely discrete. But that religious requirement is irrelevant in any case to the Taliban, whose fanatic view of Islam has been nothing but a violation of the spirit of the religion itself. Manhunt under way for Taliban who shot woman in public execution amid cheers . After an hour-long trial, Najiba was shot either by her Taliban husband or someone else. (One version of the story is she had affairs with two Taliban members.) But this case is less about Najiba and more about the Taliban demonstrating its power, even as the United States and Afghanistan attempt negotiations with the Taliban. You see, women are like the canary in the coal mine: What happens to them is an indicator of a larger political direction for the society. The Taliban has consistently used women to demonstrate its power. When it first took over much of Afghanistan in 1996, it imposed the harshest seclusion and prosecution of women in modern history. Afghan women suffered under house imprisonments. They were forbidden education and any form of mobility, to name only a few of its brutal prohibitions. But when the international community entered Afghanistan in 2001 and started introducing laws to protect women's rights, albeit in very basic ways, the Taliban retreated as its political and military power was weakened. In the past two years, however, and particularly since the international community started talking about withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Taliban began boldly resuming its own rules in provinces where they have recently regained control, such as Parwan province. And this has been reflected in one act of violence toward women after another. Through such public acts -- sometimes recorded, as this one was -- the Taliban is demonstrating its complete disregard of the Afghan government and the national rule of law. Women's rights cannot be taken lightly, nor can they be seen as a marginal issue separate from the political process of a country. The international community entered Afghanistan with a clear promise to protect women's rights and invest in creating opportunities for women to stand up on their feet. Afghan women took advantage of the opportunities that were presented. They ran for and took political offices, they sent their daughters to school, they took loans from microcredit entities and started new business, and they worked in factories all at personal risks. They are now asking whether the international community is planning to abandon them as forces prepare to depart Afghanistan in 2014, and they are worried, very worried indeed. Educated and uneducated women working in all sectors in the country are asking the same question: ""Is the international community going to sacrifice its promise to protect us from the rule of the Taliban in order to reach political settlement with it?"" If it is, then all the efforts of every soldier, every taxpayer, every humanitarian worker who has worked -- and in some cases, died -- in Afghanistan will have been in vain. To abandon the protection of women's rights to seek political agreement with a force of repression is to risk a return not only to insecurity in Afghanistan, but I'd dare say to the world. The Taliban only started its acts of violence with women. We have to remember that it did not stop there. That violence eventually affected every Afghan man and child, and it eventually came to America and impacted the world. Saving Face: The struggle and survival of Afghan women . The taping of Najiba's execution is the Taliban's message that it is confident. What's going to be the message back to them from the Afghan government and the international community? Will it be to demonstrate that women's rights and protections are valued in actions, in addition to the political statements already made condemning the execution? We all are responsible for the answer to that question. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Zainab Salbi.","Zainab Salbi: Execution of woman in Afghanistan is show of Taliban's confidence .
She says killing woman for alleged adultery flouted Afghan legal system, spirit of Islam .

"(CNN) -- Sprint superstar Usain Bolt was beaten by fellow Jamaican Yohan Blake for the second time in 48 hours on Sunday as he was pipped to first place in the 200m final at the Caribbean nation's Olympic trials. The 22-year-old Blake, who clocked a time of 9.75 secs to beat Bolt over 100m on Friday, crossed the line in 19.80 secs in Kingston -- 0.03 secs ahead of his rival. Back-to-back defeats for three-time Olympic gold medalist Bolt, the world record holder over 100 and 200m, have increased the pressure on the 25-year-old ahead of the London 2012 Games -- which start on July 27. ""I can never be discouraged,"" the 25-year-old Bolt told reporters after the race. ""I'm never worried until my coach gets worried. My coach isn't worried, so I'm OK,"" he added, referring to the Jamaican sprinter's coach Glen Mills. When asked if he had anything to prove heading into his third Games, Bolt replied: ""I would say definitely. I'm the Olympic champion, so I have to show the world that I'm the best. ""I expect to come back. Three more weeks should be enough to get myself back into shape."" For Blake, who recorded the year's leading time over 200m and a personal best in Friday's 100m, it marks another significant step in his rise to prominence after clinching World Championship 100m gold in Daegu, South Korea last year, after Bolt was disqualified from the final after a false start. Bolt and Blake are the two fastest men of all time over 200m, with the former's time of 19.19 secs the current world record. The duo will be hoping to meet again in the 100m final at London's Olympic Stadium on August 5 and the 200m showpiece on August 9. Former 100m world-record Asafa Powell and Warren Weir in the 200m complete the Jamaican line-up for the individual sprint disciplines. Three years ago Bolt set the 100m world record after running 9.58 secs at the World Championships.","Yohan Blake beats Usain Bolt over 200m at the Jamaican Olympic trials .

"(CNN) -- ""Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning"" hopes to be the next big, addictive role-playing video game, and its creators are putting an emphasis on ""big"" with a wide-ranging environment and a deep story line. But did they take on more than they were prepared to do? Big Huge Games studio general manager Sean Dunn was working in Los Angeles and content with his lifestyle there when he got a call about working on ""Reckoning."" After seeing what the project and the people were all about, he decided to head east to Baltimore and join the team there. ""This is a passionate and competitive group who want to take on Beth Soft (Bethesda Softworks),"" Dunn said. ""This team stayed together despite being bought and sold by Microsoft and THQ before being bought by 38 Studios. These people believe in what they are doing."" Dunn said the new ""Reckoning"" game contains more than 10 novels' worth of back story from best-selling fantasy author R.A. Salvatore, 45,000 to 50,000 lines of dialogue, the artistic vision of Todd McFarlane and the gaming vision of Ken Rolston. But his team of 110 people was tasked with bringing all that creative energy to life. Lead combat designer Joe Quadara, who worked on games for Crystal Dynamics and Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA), said he was skeptical at first about whether the Big Huge Games team could make a game as big as it envisioned. ""It started hitting its stride about the sixth month, in where it was 'We are making a huge game, and it's going to be great,' "" Quadara told CNN. ""Once we all convinced ourselves that we were actually doing it, we stopped looking at if we could do things or not and just started building everything."" The goal, Quadara said, was to make a fantastic role-playing game (RPG) that had a great action game built inside. He explained there were constant battles internally on balancing those two types of gaming while still presenting a cohesive story. ""There's this weird conglomerate of taking the best minds of the RPG group and taking the best minds of the action group and seeing how we could put those together,"" he said. ""The engine itself is a full-on action game, fighting game engine, but it's also a full-on RPG game engine and puts all those hooks into each other."" If trying to design hundreds of weapons with different hit effects and back stories for combat was a challenge, trying to express 10,000 years of history in the game seemed nearly overwhelming for art director Tim Coman. He likened it to riding a bike down a hill. ""You stop worrying about pedaling and just keep moving,"" Coman said. ""You just take each individual step as it's coming and focus on 'We're going to get this done, going to get this done.' "" ""There's a depth there that you know walking in, you're going to be building lots and lots of stuff,"" he added. ""Ken Whitman is our lead effects artist, and he's fantastic. He and I would have conversations daily. How do we push this, yet try to find something that is familiar enough to people so they get it?"" Coman's artistic team had debates about what was going to be represented, how it would appear visually and whether it was even needed. Eventually, the decisions came down to creating a huge, open world to appeal to gamers' sense of exploration. ""R.A. (Salvatore) came up with a line that we've repeated around here: 'If you want people to save the world, you have to give them a world worth saving.' For us, we wanted to put all that in there so that the players that really are RPG fanatics can see this is a real-deal RPG. And [for] the people that are action-game players, it is a real-deal action game."" Both Coman and Quadara admit they don't know how deep the rabbit hole goes when talking about the depth of ""Reckoning."" ""Take the blue pill,"" Coman said while laughing. ""Don't even get me started on the quests, because there is so much lore, over 10 novels' worth of writing, just in the game itself,"" Quadara added. ""The dialogue is so huge. Each person has so much that they've contributed to this game that there is no way one person could fit it all in their head."" However, they were able to fit it all on one disk. ""Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning"" is available for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC. It is rated M for Mature because of blood and gore, intense violence and suggestive themes.","New ""Reckoning"" game has more than 10 novels in back story from writer R.A. Salvatore .

"(CNN) -- Israel's top general said Iran is led by ""very rational people"" and doesn't appear poised to build a nuclear bomb that would threaten his nation. Iran ""is going step by step to the place where it will be able to decide whether to manufacture a nuclear bomb,"" Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Benny Gantz told Israel's Haaretz newspaper in Wednesday editions. ""It hasn't yet decided whether to go the extra mile."" The head of Israeli Defense Forces set a different tone than that of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who suggested to CNN on Tuesday that time is running out for Western sanctions on Iran to have a meaningful effect on Tehran's nuclear program. The sanctions ""are certainly taking a bite out of the Iranian economy,"" Netanyahu said in an interview broadcast Tuesday on CNN's ""OutFront."" But ""they haven't rolled back the Iranian program -- or even stopped it -- by one iota."" ""I hope that changes, but so far, I can tell you, the centrifuges are spinning,"" he said. ""They were spinning before the talks began recently with Iran, they were spinning during the talks, they're spinning as we speak."" See more on the Netanyahu interview . Key world powers met with Iran earlier this month about Tehran's intentions for its nuclear program and announced that the next meeting would take place in late May. Iran maintains it is not planning to build a bomb. Iranian Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, according to Gantz, likely won't build a bomb if he believes his facilities are vulnerable to Israeli attack. ""I think the Iranian leadership is composed of very rational people,"" Gantz told Haaretz. ""But I agree that such a capability, in the hands of Islamic fundamentalists who at particular moments could make different calculations, is dangerous."" The chief of staff said the military is preparing for all possible scenarios. The United States and European nations have imposed tough economic sanctions on Iran in an effort to pressure it into accepting international demands to restrict its nuclear program. ""If the sanctions are going to work, they better work soon,"" Netanyahu said on CNN. Iran insists that its nuclear program is for energy and medical purposes. U.N. and Western leaders suspect it of having military aims, including a possible nuclear weapon. Last month, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, noted what it called a sharp and troubling increase in Iran's uranium enrichment capabilities. The talks with Tehran this month involved the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- the United States, France, Russia, China, and Britain -- as well as Germany. That group has spearheaded diplomatic efforts to persuade Iran to rein in its nuclear program, but Israel has criticized the initiative as giving too much ground to Tehran and demanded that it stop all enrichment activities. Netanyahu said that if the combination of sanctions, diplomacy and ""other pressures"" succeeds in stopping Iran's nuclear program, ""I will be the happiest person in the world.""","Israel's top general says Iranian leaders are ""very rational""

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama arrives in Richmond this weekend for his first official campaign visit to the battleground state of Virginia, a hyped rally that is mobilizing both Republican and Democratic ground troops for the general election. But the fight for Virginia begins in earnest Wednesday in the Washington suburb of Chantilly, a warren of office parks and shopping malls near Dulles International Airport and just 10 miles from where the first major battle of the Civil War unfolded. Mitt Romney will campaign at a Chantilly trade show facility and begin his quest to reverse Obama's history-making win in 2008, when he became the first Democrat to carry the state on the presidential level since Lyndon Johnson did so in his landslide 1964 election. The densely populated suburban swath outside Washington is hardly the only piece of the Virginia political puzzle -- the Richmond metro area and Hampton Roads in the southeast are also critical -- but because of the number of voters and their swingy tendencies, northern Virginia is guaranteed to be showered with attention from the presidential campaigns. It's a fitting place for Romney to introduce himself to Virginians. Chantilly straddles two huge counties, Fairfax and Loudoun, that both voted for Obama in 2008. One out of eight Virginians lives in Fairfax County, and Obama won the county in blowout fashion over Sen. John McCain of Arizona, taking 60% of the vote there. But the next November, voters in Fairfax, Loudoun and Prince William counties swung back hard to Bob McDonnell, the state's Republican governor. McDonnell called the Washington suburbs, heavy with small business owners and contractors for government agencies and the military, ""tremendously important"" for Romney. ""You've got a million people in Fairfax alone,"" he said. ""You've got a couple million in those ring counties. Republicans must do well and at least break even up there to win. You can't get blown out there, as has happened in a couple past elections."" McDonnell, a social conservative who won his race with a relentless focus on jobs and the economy, described northern Virginia as ""the biggest collection of independent voters who are fiscal conservative."" ""They will vote the issues,"" he said. ""They will vote the person. Mitt has got to spent a fair amount of time there."" Until McDonnell's victory, the region had been trending Democratic in statewide elections for years. Obama, for instance, won Fairfax County by 109,000 votes. In the 2006 Senate race, Jim Webb won it by 64,000 votes over George Allen. Tim Kaine won it by a similar margin to capture the governor's mansion in 2005. And John Kerry, despite losing the state to George W. Bush in 2004, won Fairfax by 33,700 votes. But strategists for both parties say that voters are more fickle than recent election results let on. ""Those voters are far more independent than people give them credit for,"" said Chris Saxman, a co-chairman of McCain's 2008 campaign in Virginia. ""It's the great, classic suburban swing vote. It's where the state legislature has shifted its power. These are key districts. It's a very discerning kind of voter that is closely watching every election."" Democrats admit that in the wake of the 2009 McDonnell wave, the Washington area is no gimme. ""It's critically important in terms of its size and its swingy-ness,"" said one veteran Democratic operative in the state who declined to be named discussing party strategy. ""And anyone who thinks of northern Virginia as a Democratic bastion just doesn't understand the state."" The Obama campaign won in 2008, in large part with organization. His supporters ventured far outside northern Virginia to find and register new voters in urban centers and traditionally Republican precincts across the state. That's one reason why Obama is making his ""official"" re-election debut on Saturday in central Virginia, where Democrats began making gains more than a decade ago when Mark Warner won the governorship in 2001. The president's rally is at Virginia Commonwealth University in downtown Richmond, offering him the chance to appeal to his urban base while also tapping into the area's suburbs. At least one senior Republican strategist in the state gave Obama credit for the choice of venue. ""It's a smart location because you're killing a lot of birds,"" said the strategist, who did not want to be identified while complimenting the Obama campaign. ""It's a major city, a large university with a lot of students, and an area where you're going to get a lot of earned media in Chesterfield, Henrico and Hanover Counties, which are pretty significant sizes.""

"(CNN) -- Australian golfer Adam Scott took the first-round lead at the British Open after carding a spectacular six-under-par 64 on Thursday, narrowly missing out on making history. The world No. 13 looked set to card the first 62 in a major championship after eight birdies in his first 17 holes but a bogey at the last meant he had to settle for the lowest opening round in an Open championship at Royal Lytham & St. Annes and matching the overall course record. The 31-year-old finished the day one shot ahead of Scotland's 1999 British Open champion Paul Lawrie, in-form 2007 Masters winner Zach Johnson -- who won on his last PGA Tour start to earn a place in the field -- and Belgium's Nicholas Colsaerts. Why U.S. golf has a healthy future . Three time British Open champion Tiger Woods finished three shots behind Scott, tied for fifth, after a mixed opening round in his bid to win his first major since 2008. The 14-time major winner was joined on three under by 2002 British Open champion Ernie Els, former U.S. Open winners Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell plus reigning Masters champion Bubba Watson. British Open leaderboard . The buildup to the tournament was dominated by talk of the playing conditions, as Woods described the course as ""almost unplayable"" after his first practice round due to its thick rough. However, after several days of strong wind and heavy rain, benign conditions allowed the players to attack the English links course. ""It was like a walk in the park today, and not like what we've been experiencing in the practice rounds,"" Scott told the official website. ""I'm sure there's going to be some weather elements thrown at us the next three days so I'm just going to have to knuckle down and handle that."" ""But I'm confident. My ball striking is good and I think I can get round no matter what the conditions are."" Woods was leading the field before Scott began his impressive run, as the American reached four under after seven holes -- but he missed several birdie putts and dropped a shot on the 15th. ""It was a good start,"" Woods said. ""I hit the ball well all day but just lacked a bit of pace on the greens coming home. Every putt was right on line, they were dying off the front of the lip. ""I played practice rounds on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and they were completely different clubs based on the winds. ""I was shaping the golf ball both ways. Sometimes I rode the wind; sometimes I held it against it."" British hope McIlroy also endured a mixed opening round. The Northern Irishman was going well on three under when he suffered a double bogey on 15. His tee shot struck a spectator and rolled out of bounds, forcing him to return to the tee. The former world number one picked up two birdies from the remaining three holes to pull himself level with tournament favorite Woods. ""It was an eventful last four holes. Everything was going along pretty nicely,"" the 2011 U.S. Open winner said. ""I hit it slightly right and got an unfortunate break. I thought I did well to keep my composure after that. ""I didn't realize there was an out of bounds over there. It went 20 yards off his head. He could have headed it the other way! ""The most important thing was that he was okay and the birdie at 18 will make dinner taste very nice."" World number one Luke Donald ended the day on level par after a subdued round. A birdie at the par-four third proved the highlight, while the Englishman dropped a shot on the final hole to be tied for 33rd. Defending champion Darren Clarke had a miserable opening round, finishing on six over par. Clarke has been out of form since his victory and, bar a birdie at the 10th, the veteran Northern Irisdman showed no sign of last year's winning form. ""I played poorly and I putted worse. It was very disappointing because at practice I hit really, really well,"" Clarke said. ""Basically, I'm disgusted with myself."" World No. 3 Lee Westwood, still seeking his first major win, failed to live up to pre-tournament hopes as he ended on three over par. A double bogey on the third and five more dropped shots ended the Englishman's chances of threatening the top of the leaderboard. The forecast is for a mostly clear day on Friday, which should help the leaders continue their impressive start to the championship.","Australia's Adam Scott equals course record with 64 at Royal Lytham .

"London (CNN) -- Heathrow Airport is under close scrutiny over how it will cope with the influx of travelers for the London Olympics, but at least it has one fan in British writer Tony Parsons. Parsons -- author of best-selling novels including ""Man and Boy"" -- lived at the airport for seven days last year when he was Heathrow's ""writer in residence."" ""I loved it,"" says Parsons. ""I enjoyed living at the airport, I enjoyed the romance of opening my curtains and there was the runway. It was fun."" During his stay he spent time with pilots, police and security services, but one of the highlights was a visit to the Animal Reception Center (ARC) -- what Parsons calls ""the true London Zoo."" Read more: In numbers: Heathrow braced for Olympic surge . ""Everything passes through the ARC so you get rattlesnakes that some idiot smuggled back from the Nevada desert, you get polo ponies from Argentina and you get cheetahs that are en route from Ghana to Sweden that are in a box that's too small and seized,"" he says. Parsons recalls following an ARC worker on a call out to a plane returning from Las Vegas to capture two smuggled rattlesnakes that had got loose. ""All the mad stuff happens on quite a frequent basis. (The ARC employee) said the best thing to pick up a snake that's loose on a jumbo is a pillowcase and he was just wonderfully matter-of-fact about it,"" he says. But Parsons also saw the darker side of the transport hub and says he was shocked to discover the lengths some people go to in an attempt to illegally stay in Britain. ""I saw a man from Iraq, granted asylum in Greece, but he wanted to come to the UK,"" recalls Parsons. ""Under the terms of his residency in Greece he wasn't allowed to come to the UK and he ate his travel documents as he was getting off the flight so he could say, 'No, I've just arrived from my war-torn homeland.' It's quite common. ""The experience of being there was so extreme, to be with an immigration officer when they're interviewing someone and they know they've got 50 condoms full of cocaine inside them and they will not admit it. ""You don't see humanity at its very best when you're at an airport ... You see the immigration and customs officers are lied to most of the time. They see (humanity) probably at its worst, at its most criminal and venal."" Read more: A day in the life of Heathrow . Another surprise for Parsons was seeing a woman arrive on a flight from overseas dressed in a wedding gown because she wanted to marry Prince Harry -- an apparently common occurrence (it used to be William before he got hitched, adds Parsons.) The incident formed part of one of the short stories in Parsons' book ""Departures: Seven stories from Heathrow,"" inspired by his stay at the airport. Another tale was inspired by his discovery that the airport's air traffic control was manned by ""youngsters in their cargo pants."" Parsons says: ""I thought that venerable elderly gentlemen that looked something like a BBC presenter would be in charge of the skies and of course, it's all the children of Mark Zuckerberg, kids that have grown up with computers. ""There's that moment where you look around the air traffic control tower, this wonderful panoramic view of the sun coming up, the skylight of London 50 miles away, (and you think) where are all the grown ups?"" Quiz: Test your Heathrow knowledge . But Parsons was impressed with their professionalism and says many of Heathrow's employees were childhood airplane enthusiasts who never lost their passion. ""The thing that is most striking about Heathrow is how totally obsessive the people are who work there,"" he says. ""It's not just another job, for the firemen, for the pilots, for the air traffic controllers, for the people at customs, the people at immigration. They really feel as though they're in touch with something epic, something that's bigger than they are."" And he was impressed by the sheer size of the airport. Parsons says: ""The thing about Heathrow is that it's a secret city more than an airport. It's a place where 70,000 people work. It's a place where 75 million people pass through every year. ""It's got its own methodology, its own rituals and is far more than just another hub. It's like another city.""","Author Tony Parsons was writer-in-residence at London's Heathrow Airport .

"(CNN) -- Dara Torres' quest at the age of 45 to make her sixth U.S. Olympic team came down to a single, furious lap. She came up short Monday, finishing fourth in the finals of the 50-meter women's freestyle at the Olympic trials in Omaha, Nebraska, behind a trio of women nearly 20 years her junior. Torres took to the starting block both a serious contender and sentimental favorite. She's a 12-time medalist who at the 2008 Games earned the title of oldest American swimmer to win an Olympic medal. By the time she touched the wall, 24.82 seconds later, Torres capped a storied Olympic career that began in 1984 at the Los Angeles Games with a gold medal in the 4x100-meter relay, her only event. ""This is it,"" she told reporters after she got out of the pool, indicating her long, career was finally over. The top two finishers Monday secured spots on the U.S. team. Jessica Hardy, 25, won the race in 24.50 seconds, while 26-year-old Kara Lynn Joyce finished second with a time of 24.73. Christine Magnuson, 26, finished third with 24.78. In the pool, Torres appeared to pass the torch, as she hugged Hardy and Joyce, congratulating them on their one-two finish. Later, asked what she would most remember about a career with so many milestones, Torres said: ""Probably the fact that I've hung in there this long."" Runner drops out of Olympic runoff . Torres took her time getting out of the pool, looking up at the stands where for nearly three decades she has been cheered on her in Olympic bids. She then picked up her 6-year-old daughter, Tessa, who buried her head in her mother's shoulder. ""I think she's taking it harder than I am. I told her I would take her to London,"" Torres said. Last month, Torres told CNN's Piers Morgan that the road to the London Games for her would be a tough one. Her age was catching up with her, in some ways. Torres, whose sculpted body has inspired awe in middle-aged women, was battling aches and pains that come with age. She talked about hormone changes that every aging woman faces. She had undergone a state-of-the-art knee surgery after it deteriorated following the 2008 Games and spent two years recovering. Much was made about her knee and whether it would hinder the fast start needed off the blocks to be a contender in the race. Her finish in the semifinals of the 50-meter freestyle earned her a third place berth in the final. More than once, Torres walked away from swimming. She retired briefly after the 1988 Seoul Games but returned for the 1992 Barcelona Games. Heathrow on track for Olympics . She then took a seven-year break before returning for the 2000 Sydney Games, where she would win two gold relay medals and first individual Olympic medals: three bronzes medals in the 50-meter freestyle, 100-meter freestyle and the 100-meter butterfly. Torres took another break from swimming, missing the 2004 Olympics to focus on starting a family. She gave birth to her daughter in 2005. She made her last comeback at the Beijing Games in 2008, where she earned a silver medal in the 50-meter freestyle and the title of the oldest American woman to swim for the U.S. team. Torres' coach, Michael Lohberg, died last year from complication of aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease. After his death, she decided to go it alone without a coach, though she did hire a trainer. ""I really wanted to finish the story that I started with him,"" she told reporters during a news conference following the race, according to transcripts. But, she said, she knows he would have been proud of her performance. Watch Piers Morgan Tonight weeknights 9 p.m. ET.

"Washington (CNN) -- A gaffe is when a politician is caught telling the truth, the old saying goes. So it was in March when a hot microphone picked up President Barack Obama telling his Russian counterpart, Dmitri Medvedev, that he will have ""more flexibility"" if he wins re-election in November. The president's top aides scrambled to downplay the remark, assuring reporters Obama doesn't have any surprises up his sleeve should voters hand him a second term. But underlying the president's comment is a truism of American politics: Without the specter of a looming election, a second-term president is liberated to pursue policies that aren't politically tenable at the ballot box. What's more, an Obama win in November would provide an opportunity for the president to claim a mandate to press forward full-throttle with policies Republicans have spent the last two years deriding. ""He's going to try to pick up everything he didn't get the first term and he will certainly try to use whatever mandate he has going forward,"" said Jennifer Rubin, a conservative columnist for the Washington Post. Moreover, an Obama win would be a stinging defeat for Republicans who currently view the president as extremely vulnerable. The result may be a rethinking among GOP ranks on Capitol Hill about how to proceed. ""Republicans will be under a huge amount of pressure to be conciliatory,"" said Rubin. The last two presidents are instructive: Upon winning re-election narrowly in 2004, President Bush declared that he had ""earned political capital."" He spent the following months attempting to shepherd through an unpopular overhaul of Social Security, a measure so unpalatable that members of his own party forced him to drop it. After his easy re-election in 1996, Bill Clinton immediately proposed a massively priced children's health insurance bill and a significant increase in education spending (he got both). So when Vice President Joe Biden said over the weekend that he supports same-sex marriage -- a position the president has inched steadily toward but not yet backed full-bore -- conservatives and political observers alike took it as a sure sign Obama himself will embrace the issue if his next four years are secured. ""If you ask me, his position is a lot like what he said to Medvedev at the open mic in Europe,"" said former New York Gov. George Pataki on Tuesday. ""I think the American people deserve to know today where President Obama stands today and where he will stand next year on this issue."" So what else do Republicans think may result from an unbridled Obama? Many Republicans CNN spoke with pointed to taxes first. The president himself has made no secret he wants to raise taxes on American households making more than $250,000 a year. But some Republicans fear that's just the beginning. ""Eventually the structural budget and deficit will have to get addressed, and his solution is likely to be a tax increase on the middle class,"" Rubin said. The White House maintains Obama wants to overhaul the tax code, keeping rates steady for middle- and lower-income Americans while closing corporate loopholes and instituting a minimum tax on those making more than $1 million. But Obama has offered few details on the dazzlingly complex undertaking. ""There is uncertainty around the president's tax policy that scares fiscal conservatives"" said Margaret Hoover, a conservative commentator who worked in the Bush White House. ""He has to deal with taxes right away and he doesn't know how he's going to do it,"" said Brad Dayspring, a former aide to House Minority Leader Eric Cantor. Republicans also predict a massive increase in spending should the president get a second term, starting with health care. Many of the law's reforms don't kick in until 2013, promising a hefty price next year if the measure isn't modified. ""Right now there are just budget gimmicks to pay for it,"" said Dayspring, ""He has to figure out how to pay for it. And he's shown no will to reform entitlements."" ""There is a sincere fear that our economy will collapse if Obama stays in office because of spending and entitlements,"" added Matt Lewis, a conservative blogger for The Daily Caller. Uncertainty over business regulations is also causing unease. Republicans argue one of the reasons the recovery has been so sluggish is the uncertainty around increased regulations. Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has vowed to repeal the Dodd-Frank Act, the Wall Street reform measure signed into law by Obama in 2010. Particularly irksome is that the bill bestowed considerable power to rule-making agencies, like the newly established Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Should Obama win, he's likely to leave the act untouched. ""Republicans worry that not amending certain provisions of Dodd-Frank will stall the recovery,"" Hoover said. On the foreign policy front, critics say Obama could go soft on missile defense in Europe and allow Iran to strengthen its stature. ""Iran and Russia will continue to be emboldened,"" said Hoover. Of course, these doomsday scenarios are to be expected in election year politics and the president himself makes similarly unsettling predictions about what a Romney presidency would bring. Meanwhile, White House aides say climate change, energy reform and an immigration overhaul are on the top of the president's list for term No. 2. But one issue in particular has some conservatives especially wary: the Supreme Court. With three justices well into their 70s, it's likely there will be at least one retirement in the next four years on the high court, possibly from the conservative bloc. ""This is what many Republican thought-leaders are most concerned about,"" said Lewis. ""They have lifetime appointments. It's the most powerful way Obama can leave his mark.""","A second term would allow Obama to push forward with agenda .
Biden's same-sex marriage comments fueled speculation about Obama's view .

"New York (CNN) -- The American ""sport"" of competitive eating capped off its signature battle royale in New York on Wednesday with the apparent triumph of two defending champions. Joey ""Jaws"" Chestnut and Sonya ""The Black Widow"" Thomas each fended off would-be challengers during Nathan's annual hot dog-eating competition in Brooklyn. In an event likely to repulse most vegetarians, Chestnut tied his record by scarfing down 68 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes. It marks the California native's sixth win at the competition, tying his former rival, Japanese eating icon Takeru Kobayashi, who did not compete due to a contract dispute. Why gorge on hot dogs when people are starving? Thomas also successfully defended her title, setting a new women's world record after downing 45 hot dogs and buns. That smashed her previous record of 41, which she set last year. But in a similar showdown in the same New York borough, Kobayashi scarfed down 68.5 hot dogs and buns in the same amount of time in an all-you-can-eat event meant to rival the Nathan's contest. It's not clear whether the two competitions have similar rules that allow for half counts. Chestnut and Thomas attended the weigh-in for the Nathan's contest on Tuesday, with Chestnut coming in at 210 pounds and Thomas marking 100 pounds on the scale. ""The Black Widow"" used her tried-and-true method to down the dogs. ""My technique is I dunk two hot dogs in the water cup and then eat,"" she said Tuesday. The contest started nearly a century ago as a sideshow on the notorious boardwalk in Coney Island. But all that changed when Nathan's Famous Restaurant saw the draw it had for the boardwalk, and especially the eatery. Up until last year, men and women held contests together, but now have separate divisions. America celebrates Independence Day . ""It's an American institution,"" said George Shea, who along with his brother, Richard Shea, and partner David Baer took competitive eating to a new level. ""America is able to celebrate freedom -- its rights, its freedoms, all of the joys that comes with that -- by eating hot dogs in the most absurd practice ever in mankind's history."" The three introduced the coveted mustard yellow championship belt, arranging for ESPN to telecast the competition live and promoting the ""eaters"" as professional athletes. In addition to Nathan's Famous Fourth of July International Hot Dog Eating Contest, the Sheas have organized other competitions, which they've dubbed Major League Eating. Other contests include oysters, hamburgers, cheese steak, baby back ribs, buffalo wings, jalapenos, asparagus, meatballs, catfish and corned beef. ""I have never been more excited, and I'm not just saying that,"" said Shea. ""When I see Joey Chestnut -- he's an American hero, people flock around him. They flock around Sonya. I get goosebumps on my hands and realize the Fourth of July is here."" In past years, Major League Eating hyped up the gastric rivalry between Chestnut and Kobayashi, a serial holder of the mustard yellow belt. Kobayashi set his first record at his debut Nathan's competition in 2001 by eating 50 hot dogs in 12 minutes. He went on to take home the title through 2006. In the years since, he hasn't participated because of a contract dispute with Major League Eating, which placed restrictive limits on endorsement and remuneration, his representatives said. The Japanese eating legend did not want to play along, they said. In 2010, Kobayashi was arrested when he stormed the stage at the competition. Last year, he contested from afar. On the roof of a Manhattan bar, Kobayashi polished off 69 hot dogs and buns to the tune of a crowd chanting ""Kobi! Kobi!"" as the official Nathan's contest played on a television beside him, unofficially beating Chestnut's record. This year, Kobayashi participated in an event titled Crif Dogs, a newer New York hot dog institution, which started in 2001. The Crif Dog Classic took place at Roberta's, a restaurant with its own growing reputation in Brooklyn's trendy Bushwick neighborhood. ""You know we have asked Kobi probably two dozen times to come sit ... we have said let's sit, let's figure this out; we owe the world a rematch,"" Shea said. ""He doesn't want to do that, I respect him."" Despite other competitions, he said, no one can challenge Nathan's. Addressing crowds at the weigh-in Tuesday, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg got in the spirit, rattling off a string of hot dog puns -- ""dogged,"" ""catch up,"" ""cut the mustard"" and ""pronounced wiener."" Taking a roller coaster ride back in time at Coney Island . The third-term mayor then quickly offered his frank assessment of the speech, blasting his writers with relish. ""Who wrote this sh**?"" Bloomberg asked, sparking a wave of laughter at City hall .

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Greece swore in a new Cabinet on Thursday, putting an elected government in charge of the country for the first time in 224 days. The new governing coalition is made up of three parties: the center-right New Democracy, which placed first in Sunday's vote; Pasok; and the Democratic Party of the Left. Prime Minister Antonis Samaras appointed Vassilis Rapanos, chairman of the Greek National Bank, to the key finance minister post. Dimitris Avramopoulos becomes foreign minister, while Panagiotis Panagiotopoulos takes the role of defense minister, and Evripidis Stylianidis heads up the interior ministry. New Democracy lawmakers dominate the 38-member government, with only a handful of representatives coming from Pasok and the Democratic Left. Samaras, who heads New Democracy, met with the heads of his two coalition partners, Evangelos Venizelos of Pasok and Fotis Kouvelis of the Democratic Party of the Left, earlier Thursday, the broadcaster reported. The new governing coalition, which has pledged to push for a renegotiation of some of the painful austerity measures imposed under the terms of an international bailout, will face significant challenges. The country is struggling to get out of the political and financial mire that threatens to drag down Europe's common currency and spark a new global financial crisis. ""Greece has a government. ... That is the message that we need to send abroad,"" Venizelos said as he announced the deal in a televised statement Wednesday. Vassilis Monastiriotis of the Hellenic Observatory at the London School of Economics predicted that the international community will show patience with the new Greek government at least until September, not least because any alternative would be far more radical and anti-European. But, he said, ""There's no decision about how (they) actually deal with the immediate problems of acute poverty in parts of society and problems of tax collection."" Greece will go to a summit of European leaders in Brussels, Belgium, next week, determined to push them to renegotiate the terms of Greece's unpopular international bailout, most likely by extending the timetable for certain elements. While few specifics are known, all three parties are keen to renegotiate a provision under which Greece's current minimum wage of 750 euros a month (about $950) would be cut by 22%, Monastiriotis said. What will Greek elections mean for the country's future? While Samaras has been rather narrow in his views, Monastiriotis said, the politician has shown some leadership in recent days in making concessions to form the coalition. ""The Democratic Left is insisting that this platform will contain commitments that will ensure the removal of measures that have gravely affected the Greek society,"" Kouvelis said. The leftist party has supported bailouts from international lenders while seeking to renegotiate the terms. The party with the second highest number of votes, the leftist Syriza, which is against austerity measures, has declined to be a part of the government. The future of Europe: 3 scenarios . International bailouts have kept Greece from defaulting in the face of an ongoing recession and low tax revenue, but lenders have demanded hugely unpopular government budget cuts in exchange. Some observers had predicted that efforts to renegotiate the bailout could lead to a run on Greek banks and deeper misery. The country must identify additional budget cuts by the end of June to be considered compliant with the terms of its bailout. After five years of recession, unemployment is running at about 22%, taxes are going up and many of those with jobs are suffering cuts to wages. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Europe's powerful advocate for balancing budgets to build a strong basis for economic growth, had urged Greeks not to walk away from the international loan deals. Resentment of Germany has run high in Greece during the course of austerity's implementation.","NEW: Greece swears in its new Cabinet, bringing an end to months of political uncertainty .

"(CNN) -- After months and months of your cubicle walls contracting in on you like some kind of demonic fun house, it's finally time for that most coveted of reprieves: a vacation! Sun! Drinking! Ill-advised hookups with accommodating locals! (Hey, an exotic foreign bed beats the Four Elks Motor Lodge ...) While many of you may breeze out your office door, throwing around claims like ""I'm leaving my laptop at home!"" ""No cellphone on this trip!"" and ""I might just stay and become Amish!"" it's highly unlikely that you're going to completely divorce yourself from the technological realm the minute you pull on your fanny pack. Why? Well, with the rise of the smartphone and the growing ubiquity of in-flight Wi-Fi, we're about as addicted to tech as your average hipster is to heartache and broken dreams (read: very). Case in point: According to research from Xobni and Harris Interactive,72 percent of people in the U.S. check e-mail during their time off. Although we're not advocating logging in to Gmail or Entourage while sunning on Hermosa Beach (that's just indicative of a bleak, coffee-stained future), we're all for staying at least a little plugged-in whilst unplugging. Just remember, there's a fine line between sharing your vacation with your associates at home and becoming that annoyingly tan, infuriatingly-drunk-at-3-p.m. layabout who texts pictures of sun-drenched beaches to her cubicle-shackled friends. Read on for three ways to keep your clock-punching compatriots abreast of your holiday goings-on -- without making them want to leap down the elevator shaft. Share snaps wisely . Remember the good old days when, after a vacation, Dad would get out the projector and invite the neighbors over for a Jell-O mold, cocktails and an endless parade of awkward photos of you and your sister blinking into the sun in front of the Grand Canyon? Well, we've moved past the days of such outmoded projectors (unless it's a bad-ass D-ILA and you're screening ""Planet Earth"" while trying to seduce that cinephile chick you picked up at the indie film fest last week), and we really should move past the practice of photographic torture. Instead of uploading every. single. snap. to Facebook as soon as you get home, take your time selecting the most interesting and relevant shots. We're assuming that since you're putting your photos online, you want people to look at them, and no one wants to look at 15 identical pictures -- sans captions -- of your aunt standing in front of the Chinese Theatre with her arm around the dude dressed as Jack Sparrow. Also, now that Facebook has launched drag-and-drop functionality, making it easy to reorder you albums, you have no excuse for shirking chronology. Put your photos in order so that your friends can witness the progression of your vacation-induced joy and abandon -- from slightly bedraggled relief to hugging-the-redwoods-in-Muir-Woods ecstasy. For those among you who have just returned from a group vacation replete with inside jokes (""She started singing in her sleep!"" ""Hot drinks, really gets you going!"" ""The body fit in the trunk perfectly!"") and shared experiences, there's a ton of places you can view and trade snaps with your traveling companions without boring/perplexing your excluded pals. Facebook recently revamped its Groups feature, making it a more private, personal place to trade stories and pictures. There's also a new social network called the Fridge where you can create private groups that can only be seen by invitees. Such venues are probably a better place to share those naked photobooth shots than, say, Flickr. Create a guidebook via location-sharing . You know that chick? The one who's always updating her status about her wondrous vacation experiences? Yeah. We hate her. Especially when things are slow at the office and we click over to Twitter, where she's describing in vivid detail the delicious goat cheese, avocado and walnut crepe she just ingested in Mendocino. Although some of you may be hesitant about location-sharing, if you're smart about it (i.e. only letting friends follow you on Foursquare, having a closed Twitter account and Facebook profile, etc.), Foursquare and the like can be great for sharing your experiences with your friends. Instead of just broadcasting how much fun you're having at that bike-punk bar in the Mission, check in via Foursquare and tell your friends about the awesome jukebox chock-fulla obscure polka tracks. That way, they can learn a little about your getaway locale of choice and perhaps get some tips for future trips. And, bonus for you: You'll have a detailed record of everywhere you visited -- which comes in handy when, months later, you're trying to remember where you met that dude who keeps texting you about seeing his metal band play when he's in town next week. Let people know you're gone . This may seem obvious, but, um, you should probably tell people when you go out of town for a week or so. Yeah, you've probably already set up your vacation responder at work (Make sure you spell everything right in that sucker; you don't need clients thinking you're an idiot when you're not even around to mess up in person), but your friends and relations probably wanna know your whereabouts at as well. You know, so they don't think you hate them. We suggest putting up a non-annoying Facebook status announcing that you're taking off, as well as shooting off a quick mass e-mail. You can also use this opportunity to crowdsource your pals and ask them what to hit up while you're off the clock.

"(CNN) -- The viral Kony 2012 video has propelled the Lord's Resistance Army and its leader, Joseph Kony, into the world's spotlight and conscience. On YouTube alone, more than 56 million people viewed it in its first four days. As the video created by Invisible Children shows, the LRA has created an enormous human rights and humanitarian crisis in central and east Africa. The LRA, which began as a rebel group in Uganda, evolved into a brutal renegade force that has abducted tens of thousands of civilians, forcing them to serve as soldiers or sex slaves, has killed tens of thousands and has displaced more than 2 million in four African nations: Uganda, newly independent South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic. The message of the Kony 2012 campaign is simple: Arrest Kony. But the campaign also sets out what the United States government needs to do, in partnership with other members of the international community and civil society groups in Africa, to make this happen. Our organization, the Enough Project, joined with two advocacy groups, Invisible Children and Resolve, to send President Obama a letter on how to move toward ending the LRA. The United States must commit to keeping on the ground the military advisers that it deployed to central Africa a few months ago and providing diplomatic, logistical and intelligence support to efforts by governments in the region to make sure the advisers can succeed. Right now, the administration has a critical window of opportunity: The advisers are in the field and an initiative of the African Union is taking shape. President Obama should reach out personally to African and European leaders and lead a diplomatic surge aimed at finally bringing an end to this 25-year crisis. The U.S. military advisers are by no means a simple, stand-alone solution. For them to have an opportunity to succeed, the administration must ensure they have the necessary partner forces, capabilities and equipment. This means the United States should: Secure more capable forces from an African nation, such as South Africa or Botswana; provide intelligence and transportation support, especially helicopters; and get additional support from the international community. The United States must urge regional governments to increase their commitment. In particular, the Ugandan army -- the best-equipped military of the countries affected by the LRA -- has already deployed many of its most capable troops to Somalia to combat the terrorist group al-Shabaab. It is planning to send even more there, at the expense of their commitment to combat the LRA elsewhere. The Obama administration should also work rapidly to resolve the impasse between the governments of Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. As seen in the recent spike in LRA attacks in Congo, Kinshasa's insistence that the Ugandan army no longer operate there is causing the country to become a safe haven for the LRA. Civilian protection must be prioritized and improved dramatically. The United States must also monitor the human rights abuses and natural resource exploitation of the Ugandan military and other militaries and insist on accountability for any crimes committed. The administration needs to keep U.S. advisers in place until they can succeed. In the region, 20 civil society, human rights and religious groups in areas affected by LRA violence (Congo, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic) have welcomed the advisers, and they hope the United States will fulfill its promises. A military campaign to apprehend the LRA's top leaders and protect civilians is necessary but insufficient. Military operations alone simply cannot capture all the LRA's commanders. Even if Kony and a few additional leaders are captured, others will take their place. Therefore, the United States needs to lead the international community in developing and implementing a defection strategy that encourages LRA commanders, including senior and mid-ranking commanders, and rank-and-file fighters to leave the group. Increased radio programming should be used to encourage defections and to sensitize communities so that LRA combatants who do defect no longer have to fear being attacked by local populations. The United States and others in the international community must work closely with civil society leaders in the region and make a long-term commitment to rebuild and reconcile communities affected by the LRA. Millions of people in northern Uganda, Congo, South Sudan and the Central African Republic are counting on increased and sustained engagement by the United States and others. The Obama administration should immediately pursue a diplomatic surge and additional initiatives to make 2012 the year that all communities plagued by the LRA can begin to recover and rebuild. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John C. Bradshaw and Ashley Benner.","Bradshaw, Benner: Kony 2012 video spotlights brutal Kony and Lord's Resistance Army .

"(CNN) -- Hailed as the ""world's greatest golf course"" by its owner before it had even opened, Trump International Links has a lot to live up to. The statement would have been ridiculed by the golfing community had it not been made by a man who has pumped $150 million into his dream to date, with plans to spend over $1 billion by the time the controversial Scottish project is completed. It has already bulldozed past environmentalists' concerns, but Donald Trump is reluctant to continue development due to a planned offshore wind farm. The fact that some of the key names in European golf attended this month's opening -- surrounded by bagpipers and the miles of towering sand dunes along its Aberdeenshire coast site -- is testament to the power of his brand. The American billionaire owns a dozen luxury golf resorts -- including Florida's faded Doral and its renowned ""Blue Monster"" course which he plans to renovate -- but can his UK venture be considered a contender for top spot so early on? Blowing in the wind? Trump threatens to ditch $1B Scottish golf resort . Of course, criteria for judging the ""greatest"" vary from golfer to golfer, with emphasis ranging from degree of challenge to spectacular views or history. For Trump International to be considered as one of the greats, it first has to establish itself as a venue among Scottish links courses. That will be no mean feat, with illustrious company including ""the home of golf ""St. Andrews and other current Open venues Muirfield, Turnberry, Royal Troon and Carnoustie. Turnberry stands out as the most picturesque of those courses, while Muirfield hosts the world's oldest golf club and Carnoustie is often regarded as the toughest. On the other side of the Irish Sea, there are the two outstanding links courses currently vying to host an Open; Royal County Down and Royal Portrush. There's also hot competition south of the border in England, including the traditional highly-rated links of Royal St. George's and this year's Open venue, Royal Lytham and St. Annes. The latter has seen the great amateur golfer Bobby Jones in 1926 and flamboyant Spaniard Seve Ballesteros in 1979 and 1988 among its victors. Trump International is starting on the back foot against its British rivals, but with broadcast cables already running beneath the course and a plan in place for several thousand spectators, it has a strong case to one day host major tournaments. Perhaps a fairer match for the new course would be against eight-year-old Cape Kidnappers in New Zealand, which runs along and around ridges on a secluded stretch of jagged coastline. It has already jumped up magazine rankings and attracted visitors from around the world with its spectacular views. The edge that Trump International possesses is that it can be classed as links golf, which is favored by purists as the ""true"" setting for the game. Acclaimed English golf architect Martin Hawtree has skilfully routed holes around and between the massive dunes, some measuring 80 feet in height. His family business has worked on course designs for a hundred years and put its hand to several British Open venues. To get to the very top, Trump's new creation must surpass several private and exclusive courses in his home country, which have dominated magazine rankings for decades. Cypress Point in California boasts some of the most dramatic holes in the world, playing over Pacific Ocean bays where seals bask on the rocks amid crashing waves. The course was styled by Alister MacKenzie -- a renowned architect who also designed Augusta National, the lush and colorful Georgia setting for the annual Masters Tournament since 1934. Most golfers can only dream of setting foot on these courses, along with Pine Valley in New Jersey, often considered the most perfect example of golf architecture on land that -- unlike the stunning natural beauty that awaits players at Trump International -- was previously unremarkable. The notable exception to the top-ranked private clubs in the U.S. is Pebble Beach, the picturesque Californian coastal course which is a video-game favorite and open to the public. It's not cheap though, with a round costing $495 per person. One venue that every other struggles to compete with is St. Andrews' Old Course, which is at the top of every golfer's bucket list. It might not be the most dramatic or challenging course but it will always be the home of the game, where hard wooden balls were thrashed around wasteland almost six hundred years ago. Trump International cannot compete with the history of its Scottish neighbors and it won't echo the exclusivity and originality of some of its American cousins. Unlike many of its iconic rivals, it has no ""signature"" hole, but is comprised of a series of stern but fair tests that will suit different players according to personal preference. However, as it matures into its ""championship course"" billing with the backing of the professional game's organizers, it certainly has a fighting chance of one day becoming the most dramatic of tournament venues.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- India's Ministry of Education on Wednesday revealed what it calls the least expensive computer tablet in the world: a device that costs 2,276 rupees, or less than $50. To launch the tablet, Kapil Sibal, the minister of human resources and development, communications and information, gave a lofty speech in front of a crowd of students in New Delhi. ""There are some moments in history which will be milestones recognized by future generations. This is one such moment."" Sibal said. ""Today, we see the beginning of a dream realized; a dream in which every student in every corner of this country will have access to technology that defines the 21st century."" The device is called Aakash, which means ""sky"" in Hindi. It is the product of a joint venture between one of India's elite Institutes of Technology -- IIT Rajasthan -- and DataWind, the manufacturer that won the bid. ""Every vision has detractors. A lot of things were said about this project ... (that) it was simply impossible. But it wasn't just that others said it can't get done by Indians or in India. The worst was when people said we wish it wouldn't happen,"" said Suneet Singh Tuli, CEO of DataWind. But while the device is assembled in India, it is not completely made there. Roughly 40% of the parts come from South Korea, 25% from China, 16% from the United States and 16% from India. Still, one student in the crowd remarked: ""You cannot even get a touch screen phone at this price. People used to say only China can make such devices. We can now say yes, India is on par."" The idea was dreamed up by the Education Ministry through its National Mission on Education through Information and Technology (NME-ICT). On the box, the gadget is not called a computer tablet but a ""mobile Internet device."" It uses Android technology and is light, 7 inches long, and has an HD screen. The ministry has put professors' lectures from IIT on the device, which can, of course, also play movies. It does have a few drawbacks. It has Internet access only via Wi-Fi, and it has only 2 gigabytes of internal memory, but that can be boosted to 32 gigabytes with an SD card. The touch screen is not as sensitive as that of an iPad, so scrolling with fingers takes some real digging. The students quickly figured out that using a pen as a stylus worked better. The Education Ministry admits the Aakash is not perfect, but it says it will improve on its product as it gets feedback from students. In India, buying a new BlackBerry or an iPhone 4 will set you back from $500 to $700, and most people cannot afford a price anywhere near that. The Aakash would cater to many more people, but it is not for sale yet. At this point, only 100,000 of the devices are in the manufacturing pipeline. The Education Ministry says it will send those to colleges in India's 33 states and territories. It is meant for the disadvantaged, not those who can buy any new gadget they want. ""[It's] for the benefit of students who do not have access to libraries."" a government official said. But at some point -- maybe in November -- the private company that helped complete the project may begin sales, but only in India for now. This isn't the first time the country has surprised the world with an amazingly inexpensive product. In 2009, Tata Motors wowed critics with the world's cheapest car. The Tata Nano was priced at less than $2,500. Those in India's Education Ministry say they dream of a day when students around the world are able to get their hands on an Aakash computer, because of its affordability. And the ministry and its partners are not done trying to bring down the price. The ultimate goal is to make a computer for just $10. They are on their way.","Device is called Aakash, which means ""sky"" in Hindi, and costs 2,276 rupees .

"(CNN) -- There are just 50 days to go until the Olympic Games begin in London, but for some people the pinnacle of the sporting year arrived last week in the Cotswolds -- one of England's most picturesque locations. Shin-kicking is not counted as one of the 36 Olympics sports, but it is a key event at Robert Dover's ""Cotswold Olimpicks"""" -- an ancient event which is 400 years old in 2012. James Wiseman was a shin-kicker. He wears a benevolent smile framed by a beard in the style of a 17th century yeoman. He's dressed accordingly in a baggy-sleeved shirt and breeches, but he also has a darker side. Having reached the Mount Olympus of shin-kicking -- a place in the Olimpick final -- he fell short of the summit and he retired from competition to become an Olimpick judge. Bolt: ""I can break 100m world record"" ""Shin-kicking is probably the blue riband event and I'm probably biased because I judge it but it is the sport that people come to see,"" Wiseman told CNN. And they come to see it in their thousands, as they have done for four centuries. The Cotswold Olimpicks takes place on a hillside above the Gloucestershire town of Chipping Campden, whose honey-colored stone houses and thatched cottages contribute to its reputation as one of the most sought-after residences in England. The event was the idea of a lawyer, Dover, who received the blessing of King James I to transform an existing whitsun fair into a series of games modeled on the old Olympian ideal of strength and endeavor. Ancient events like the tug-of-war and standing jump made it into early editions of the modern Olympics. Shin-kicking did not. Why U.S. must win Olympic basketball gold . ""Shin-kicking, certainly in the way we do it today, is very little changed from the way they did it in 1612,"" says Wiseman. ""In those days they probably wouldn't have called it shin-kicking they would have called it 'Cotswold wrestling' but the rules were so loose that the only things you couldn't do was gouge or bite, so everything else was allowed and shin-kicking was a natural way to weaken your opponent."" Shin-kicker Ben Greenall knows all the right moves to weaken an opponent. He has shin-kicking in his blood and I suspect the blood of several opponents' shins on his boots. His dad is Chairman of the Olimpicks and his family is steeped in the history of the sport.. ""Well it all started because you've got the lowlands down there and us high-men up here and you would come to the middle to sort out the differences between yourselves and because you didn't want it to become too bad they agreed on this form of wrestling where basically in them days it was the first man to get a broken leg was the loser."" As Greenall continues I wonder just what might constitute ""too bad."" ""It got pretty brutal in those days as well, steel toecaps were allowed and the lads used to beat their legs with wooden mallets to toughen up the bone and skin and all the muscle."" Greenall explains to what extent the sport has changed since then. ""Well we banned the steel toe-caps so basically we do it now till the man is tripped over. I think broken legs were a common occurrence and some nasty injuries, whereas, although we have some nasty injuries we very rarely have broken bones."" Another sop to the soft-hearted 21st-century modern man is the option of using straw to pad your socks and hopefully cushion the blows. Greenall forgoes such pampering and opts for the bare-skin shin of the extreme kicker. Choosing ridicule over raw pain I stuff my socks with handfuls -- ""wodges"" as they are known in the sport -- of scratchy straw until my lower limbs resemble bloated woolly sausages. But Greenall is about to light the barbecue and I'm destined for the grill. Before I rise to the challenge Wiseman chips in with a bit of advice. ""The main key ingredient you need to be a successful shin-kicker is surprisingly not strong shins but stamina. So you need a good sense of balance, you need stamina and you need to be able to land a few good kicks as well."" Encouraged by this information I ask: ""What are your legs like the next day?"" The answer is less encouraging. ""They're very, very painful. In fact it's not just the first day. The first time I did it, it was six months before they stopped being painful."" Hmmm. ""Don't worry, I'll go easy on you,"" says a grinning Greenall. ""But first you've got to put on your shepherd's smock. We're in sheep country, so originally it was all shepherds who fought."" I haul the unflattering brown garment over my head and Greenall grabs me by the shoulders ready to begin his masterclass. Desperate to delay the inevitable defeat, I say: ""Wait...let's talk a little bit about technique."" My opponent smiles again: ""Not much -- attack and block, hack and slash, no headbutts and we shake hands at the end."" We followed that script pretty much to the letter and I lasted barely 30 seconds before being sent tumbling head over heels. As I watched the real competition get underway, I realized that Greenall the Gentle Giant really had been easy on me. Booted battles were greeted with great cheers from the crowd. Some bouts lasted a draining ten minutes, others barely seconds as a hefty hoof brought down another pretender to the throne. But as 1980s action film Highlander tells us, there can be only one and when Olimpicks (rather than Olympics) are discussed in these parts, neither Usain Bolt nor Michael Phelps will be the name spoken in terms of the highest reverence. It is the name of Zac Warren, a 23-year-old stone mason from the neighboring county of Worcestershire. It is he who, on the 400th anniversary of the Cotswold Olimpicks, bears the title of Champion Shin-Kicker.","The London 2012 Olympic Games start in 50 days .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Anna Nicole Smith's boyfriend-lawyer Howard K. Stern and Dr. Khristine Eroshevich were found guilty Thursday on charges of conspiring to provide drugs using false names. Another defendant in the case, Dr. Sandeep Kapoor, was acquitted on all counts against him. ""This is really a victory not just for me, but it is a victory for patients everywhere in our nation who suffer chronic pain,and physicians who treat difficult chronic pain every day,"" Kapoor said outside the courthouse. The jury failed to convict any of the defendants of providing drugs to a known addict, which was the linchpin of the prosecution's case. Stern was acquitted on seven of the nine counts he faced. ""These were all the counts related to whether the medications were for a legitimate medical purpose or for whether Anna Nicole was an addict,"" Stern said. ""What the jury did find me guilty of were two conspiracy counts limited exclusively to my name being used on medications for Anna. This was done to protect Anna Nicole's privacy and it was nothing more than that."" The verdicts came in a complex case that included two months of testimony and 13 days of jury deliberations. Stern's attorney, Steve Sadow, said after the trial that the conspiracy conviction for his client was for Stern having given his consent to Eroshevich to use Stern's name on prescriptions intended for Smith. The charges against Eroshevich, a psychiatrist who flew to Smith's side in the Bahamas after her son's death in 2006, were related to using Stern's name and another woman's name to write prescriptions for Smith. Stern and the doctors were charged with conspiring to feed the reality TV star and Playboy model's drug addiction, and using false names to obtain the drugs over the last three years of her life. The three defendants were not charged in Smith's February 2007 death in a Florida hotel, which a medical examiner ruled was an accidental overdose of a sleep aid combined with the effects of a viral flu. After the verdicts were read, Eroshevich said she ""felt good,"" despite the conviction because she was prepared for the jury's decision. The case raised questions about ethical boundaries in a doctor-patient relationship, the prescribing of painkillers and anti-anxiety medicines and the use of fake names when treating celebrities. The defense called only one witness -- an expert who concluded that Smith suffered from chronic pain, depression and anxiety, not drug addiction. Her drug dependency was legal since it was for legitimate medical purposes, including for treatment of her pain and anxiety, defense lawyers argued. The prosecution said the doctors never said no to Smith's drug-seeking because they wanted to be part of her celebrity entourage. False names were used by Stern and the doctors to hide excessive prescriptions from the state's computer system that monitors drug usage, prosecutors argued. The defense said it is a common practice in Hollywood, used to protect celebrities' privacy from prying tabloid reporters. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Robert Perry hinted before the verdicts were returned that if any defendants were found guilty, he would consider ""possible selective prosecution issues"" when sentencing them. He would have the power to reduce most of the felony charges to misdemeanors. After the verdicts were returned, Perry set sentencing for January 6. Stern and Eroshevich could face a maximum of three years each in prison, according to the prosecutor's office.","NEW: Dr. Kapoor calls his acquittal a victory for all chronic pain patients .

"(Wired) -- We're all familiar with Apple's love affair for thin devices. Although the third-generation iPad surprised many by gaining about half a millimeter of thickness, it looks like Apple could be back to trimming product dimensions by using a new kind of display technology in the next iPhone. Instead of using a display comprising a number of separate layers, Apple could use in-cell touch display technology, according to a Friday report from Digitimes. The report says Apple would be sourcing its in-cell displays from Toshiba and Sharp. ""The advantage of in-cell is that you're streamlining the manufacturing process, so in time you should be able to drive efficiencies and reduce cost,"" IHS analyst Rhoda Alexander told Wired. ""Additionally, by reducing the number of layers, you reduce the size and thickness of the device, making it thinner and lighter."" If the iPhone has a larger 4- to 4.3-inch display, as some reports expect it to, that extra glass could add a bit of heft to the iPhone's weight. Thus, Apple would need to find new ways to keep the phone from gaining too much weight. Currently, the iPhone's ""on cell"" display is layered a bit like a sandwich (or if you're feeling like dessert, think of a trifle). At the very bottom, you've got the back light. Directly above that, the LCD section, which houses the red-, green-, and blue-colored pixels of the display. Then there's a layer of glass. On top of that is the capacitive touch layer, which is then topped off by a tough layer of Gorilla Glass. The middle layer of glass separates the liquid crystal portion of the display from the touch portion. In-cell display tech eliminates that middle layer of glass, combining the LCD and touch sections of the display into a single layer. One way this can be successfully accomplished is by ""multiplexing"" the electrodes normally used to relay touch input -- that is, using the same electrodes to handle the signals for both touch control and the pixels of the LCD, according to a 2010 IHS report on touch-screen displays. In-cell technology isn't currently deployed in any shipping cellphones. And it shouldn't be confused with the similar-sounding ""Super"" technologies from Samsung. Super AMOLED and Super LCD screens use on-cell technology rather than in-cell. Right now, in-cell touch displays are still an emerging technology. So while the core technology promises long-term benefits, yield rates could be a problem in the shorter terms, Alexander says. But that's the deal with any new technological process, isn't it? In the months before the new iPad was announced, yield rates for Apple's Retina display were a huge question mark. So is in-cell really something Apple would pull the trigger on? ""We do believe that the next iPhone display will implement in-cell touch,"" DisplaySearch's Paul Semenza told Wired via e-mail. But of course, we'll have to wait and see how it pans out when the next iPhone actually debuts . Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

"(Rolling Stone) -- John Mellencamp's 25th album, ""No Better Than This,"" continues the thread of American archaeology that he began on ""Trouble No More,"" a self-produced 2003 set of traditional songs and covers. But where ""Trouble"" was a first brush with history -- Mellencamp trying to make it come to him -- here he meets that history on its home ground. A set of old-school originals recorded in resonant settings (Sun Studio in Memphis; the First African Baptist Church in Savannah; a hotel room in San Antonio where Robert Johnson cut some classic sides), ""No Better"" shows Mellencamp channeling spirits and stepping into period styles. They fit him perfectly. Producer T Bone Burnett rides shotgun, and the duo keep it simple: an old Ampex reel-to-reel tape recorder, a single vintage ribbon mic, a small group of empathetic players. They include ex-Tom Waits guitarist Mark Ribot; Jay Bellerose, whose rhythms shaped Robert Plant and Alison Krauss' Raising Sand; and stand-up bassist David Roe, who played with Johnny Cash at the end of his life. Mellencamp's songs show a writer still on a hot streak after 2008's Burnett-produced ""Life, Death, Love and Freedom,"" arguably the singer-songwriter's best LP since his 80s heyday. He shoots for timeless here: Aside from an allusion to an answering machine on the Woody Guthrie-style ""Thinking About You,"" these songs could have all been written 50 years ago or more. ""Save Some Time to Dream"" is a gentle folk sermon with a dash of existential doubt. The swinging ""Right Behind Me"" considers Jesus and the devil -- ""both inside of me/All the time"" -- with Miriam Sturm's jazzy Hot Club fiddle. Considering the title, Mellencamp has made a remarkably dark record. ""No One Cares About Me"" is about a guy out of work, ditched by his wife, mourning a father, a son and his only friend, over an old-timey hillbilly strut. The lead character in ""A Graceful Fall,"" a stumpy waltz, is also penniless, ""sick of life"" and pondering the afterlife, ""if there is really one."" The dude in ""Each Day of Sorrow"" insists he would kill himself ""if I weren't so afraid."" But as usual, Mellencamp is at his best when he turns hardscrabble struggle into damn-the-torpedoes rock & roll. On the title track, a classic Sun Records ""boom-chick-boom"" romp, Mellencamp runs through a list of fantasies, some quite reasonable, before concluding that ""it won't get no better than this"" -- however relatively [expletive]-up ""this"" might be. Welcome to life in 21st-century America, ladies and gentlemen: Let's party like it's 1929. ""No Better Than This"" isn't a perfectly honed set. But Mellencamp has never sounded looser or easier on a record. The most indelible moments are straight-up funny. ""Love at First Sight"" imagines a relationship from back-seat grope through marriage, kids and subsequent disasters, before deciding it might be better to go home alone. And on ""Easter Eve,"" a man and his 14-year-old son get hassled in a cafe, slash a [expletive] up, get thrown in jail, then walk off with the dude's grateful wife. It's musical storytelling for hard times: far-fetched, violent, sexy, played for laughs. It doesn't get more timeless, or American, than that.

"(CNN) -- A man shot this month when a gunman opened fire inside a busy Toronto shopping mall died as a result of his injuries Monday, raising the death toll from that shooting to two, police said. The name of the second victim, a 22-year-old man, cannot be released because of a court-ordered publication ban, Toronto police said in a statement. The first victim, Ahmed Hassan, 24, died the day of the shooting, June 2. Gunfire started around 6:25 p.m. that day, as people were eating dinner in the crowded food court area of the Eaton Centre mall in downtown Toronto. Seven people were shot, while a pregnant woman was ""stomped on"" in the resulting frenzy, Detective Sgt. Brian Borg, the lead investigator in the case, has said. A suspect, Christopher Husbands, surrendered to authorities and is currently in custody. He faces one count of first-degree murder and six counts of attempted murder, according to police. Husbands, 23, was supposed to be under house arrest when police say he went to the mall and opened fire.","A 22-year-old man dies as a result of his injuries, police say .

"(CNN) -- The first book I read by myself was Else Holmelund Minarik's ""Little Bear."" The illustrations were by Maurice Sendak. I was in my first grade classroom at Clermont Elementary in Clermont, Florida. I was sitting in an orange plastic chair. I was holding ""Little Bear."" I was studying the third story in the book, which is titled ""Little Bear Goes To The Moon,"" and I was staring at a picture of Little Bear, home-made space helmet atop his head, floating toward the moon. The words below the illustration said, ""I'm going to fly to the moon."" And somehow, suddenly, I was reading this sentence. And then I was reading the one below it, which said, "" 'Fly!' said Mother Bear. 'You can't fly.' "" A current of electricity shot through me. My feet tingled. My shoulders itched. I was reading! I was reading a book on my own! Those first words that I read by myself are intimately and forever bound to the art that appeared above them. It was as if the art were the doorway and it ushered me toward the words waiting on the other side. I entered the text through the art. It was one of the most powerful moments of my life. Sendak sparked 'wild' creativity in young readers . When I heard Maurice Sendak had died, I pulled my copy of ""Little Bear"" off the shelf and I turned to the third story in the book and I looked at that picture of Little Bear in his makeshift helmet headed to the moon and I felt again a zap of electricity. I flipped through the pages and came to a picture of Little Bear floating above a village. These words appear below the illustration: . ""Little Bear thought.

"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- A gay man expelled from the Boy Scouts in 2003 said Monday he misses being a scout but has no regrets. ""There is no bitterness in my heart against these people,"" Greg Lattera said in an interview following his court appearance. ""They are still an organization that gave me the core values as to who I am."" Lattera testified Monday at the federal court case filed by the Boy Scouts of America attempting to keep the $1-a-year lease for their downtown Philadelphia offices. The local chapter, Cradle of Liberty Council, was told by the city to pay $200,000 a year to lease the building or vacate the headquarters that have been located on city land since 1928. The national scout policy that prohibits the hiring of gay men puts the local chapter in violation of the city charter and an ordinance outlawing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and other grounds. The lawsuit contends the city's ultimatum violates their First Amendment rights and that the city's position is unconstitutional and violates the organization's right to free speech and equal protection. Lattera was 18 when he attended a local meeting about gays and the scouting policy. The meeting was open to the press, he said. ""Here IÂ¹m thinking this is a meeting about the policy and how I feel about it,"" he said. ""I'm in my uniform and next thing I knew was that I was on TV."" Two weeks later, on June 6, 2003, he received a letter ordering him to sever all ties with the scouts because they ""received information"" that led to his dismissal. ""I broke down and cried,"" said Lattera, now 25, adding the scouts opened his eyes to the world around him and taught him life skills. ""It was like a part of me was taken away."" In court, Lattera answered questions about the 2003 meeting and the letter. At the time of his dismissal, Lattera was a camp counselor and held the rank of Life Scout, which is one step below the organizationÂ¹s highest rank of Eagle Scout. He joined the scouts at age 10. Lattera, who declined to name his scout troop or reveal where he resides, said scouting is about more than a building. ""No matter what they say or do, itÂ¹s not my choice,"" he said. ""Â³Scouting isnÂ¹t the building. The troops will still be there in the morning. People make the scouts.""

"(CNN) -- Debra Guenterberg doesn't have to go to a horror movie to get spooked. She says she's been living a nightmare for the past 13 years. The Wisconsin woman says she's been stalked by two phantoms. Two men stole her name and her husband's Social Security number. They used the information to obtain credit cards, buy cars and three homes. Like many horror movie villains, the bad guys keep coming back. Thirteen years after the men stole their names, the Guenterbergs are still being turned down for credit because of the damage done by the men, she says. ""It's a nightmare,"" Guenterberg says. ""We both feel physically and mentally exhausted. We feel hopeless because we can't fix this."" Most people know about the financial hit identity theft victims take. But less attention is paid to the emotional costs they also pay. Victims often experience paranoia, depression, rage -- some even endure family breakups, security experts say. There are many ways someone's identity can be stolen. Much of it now occurs online. A person's identity can be stolen from a social media site, through online banking or after they have clicked on a deceptive e-mail. But no matter how it happens, the victim is going to pay -- financially and emotionally, cybersecurity officials say. The Guenterbergs say they've battled the IRS, elected officials and local sheriffs to reclaim their name. They've also undergone counseling. ""We're angry,"" Debra Guenterberg says. ""We can't sleep at night. ... We want to move on."" The hidden toll of ID theft . Moving on, though, often requires justice. And that can be elusive for victims of identity theft, security experts say. The identities of an estimated 9.1 million Americans have been stolen by thieves lifting personal information off the Internet or through other means, according to a 2008 survey conducted by Javelin Strategy & Research, a financial services research firm. But it often takes the average identity theft victim months, if not years, to resolve their case, security experts say. Some say that no matter what they do, they still encounter problems getting credit. Robert Guenterberg tried to open a checking account earlier this year, but says the bank turned him down because it confused him with the men who had stolen his Social Security number. ""It never ends,"" Robert Guenterberg says. The Guenterbergs say their ordeal began 13 years ago when Robert Guenterberg tried to buy a Ford truck but was rejected because of poor credit. He got the same answer when he tried to get a home loan and a credit card. When the collection agencies started calling, the Guenterbergs say they finally discovered the source of their problem. They say two men had stolen the couple's name and Robert' Guenterberg's Social Security number. The Guenterberg's situation was especially thorny because it involved the loss of his Social Security number. The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit group that educates consumers about privacy protection, tells people that even if an imposter is using their Social Security number, the Social Security Administration will only issue a new number in extreme cases. Michael Kaiser, executive director of the National Cyber Security Alliance, says getting a new Social Security number is tough and can complicate an identity theft victim's life even more. ""They can [get a new Social Security number] but the hassle may not be worth it,"" Kaiser says. What the scammers say after they've been caught . Even if victims of identity theft are able to clean up their financial records, some must learn how to overcome their bitterness. Linda Foley had to learn that lesson. Foley had just started working as a restaurant reviewer for a San Diego magazine when her employer asked her to fill out tax forms to get paid. Foley says her employer then used her Social Security number to obtain three credit cards and a cell phone. She says she uncovered the deception when one of her credit card companies called during a routine credit check to verify her change of address. That's when Foley learned that her boss was living it up on credit cards with her name. ""She was getting gourmet meals home delivered,"" Foley says. ""She was getting vitamins; she was going on shopping sprees at department stores."" Foley says she's not the same person she was before her identity was stolen. ""It changes your life,"" she says. ""I don't trust the way I used to. I don't share things with people as much as I used to."" Foley says she never talked to the woman who stole her identity, but she always wanted to. The woman was eventually caught and apologized to a judge in court for stealing Foley's identity. Foley was so angry that she wanted to personally confront the woman. But Foley says her lawyer restrained her. ""I came to understand that what she did was because of what she is,"" Foley says. ""How could she explain that to anybody? They [scammers] live a different life; they live in a different world."" Foley says she and her husband, Jay, formed Identity Theft Resource Center, which educates individuals and businesses about identity theft. In her new role, Foley says she talked to identity theft scammers. None of them saw themselves as criminals, she says. ""The reason they gave is, 'No one is going to get hurt,' '' Foley says. ""They don't see this as a crime of victimization."" Some identity thieves are so cold-blooded that they even prey on their closest relatives, Foley says. ""I've worked with people whose parents have stolen their information for 25 years,"" Foley says. ""They've had their parents jailed."" Tips for preventing identity theft are now well known. Only give out a Social Security number if you must; install a firewall on your home computer; don't use biographical information in your passwords. Linda Foley's husband, Jay, co-founder of Identity Theft Resource Center, says one of the best precautions a person can take is something simple: Pay attention to what they click on the Internet. ""You get yourself into a big rush and something pops up in front of you, you deal with it and move and then you say, 'What did I just do?' "" says Jay Foley. Perhaps one of the best precautions is to remember the struggles of people like the Guenterbergs. Losing money to a thief is not the same as losing one's identity, Debra Guenterberg says. ""If somebody steals your wallet and you notice what they've done on your credit report, you still have protection from that, though it's still a nightmare, '' Debra Guenterberg says. ""But when someone overtakes your life and becomes you -- that's insane.""","The toll of identity theft includes financial and emotional costs .

"(CNN) -- One of two gay men jailed in Malawi after they got engaged has been transferred to another prison, a human rights campaigner and gay rights activist said Wednesday. It was not clear why Steven Mojenza was moved from Chichiri prison, where he had been serving time with his partner, Tiwonge Chimbalanga. The pair was sentenced last week to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of gross indecency and unnatural acts. Though in separate cells at Chichiri, the men were able to see each other briefly ""from time to time,"" said Peter Tatchell, a London-based gay rights activist who has been advocating for the men. Gift Trapence, executive director of the Malawi-based human rights group Center for the Development of People, visited Chimbalanga in prison Wednesday and said Mojenza was not the only prisoner who was moved to another facility. Trapence said he planned to visit Mojenza at the new prison Thursday and would learn more then. Tatchell expressed fears for Mojenza's mental and physical health. No appeal has been scheduled, Trapence said. ""The lawyers are going to submit the papers either this week or next week,"" he told CNN from Malawi. ""The court is going to give the dates for the appeal, so we can't speculate right now because the court has not given the date."" Lawyers for the men are hopeful the 14-year sentence will either be reduced or thrown out on appeal, Trapence said. The two men, both in their 20s, were arrested in December at their home in Blantyre, Malawi, for professing their love in a traditional engagement ceremony. They were rounded up after news reports surfaced, charged under colonial-era sodomy laws and detained at Chichiri prison without bail. The arrests received some popular support in the conservative southern African nation, but sparked condemnation by gay-rights activists. Human-rights groups including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have called for the couple's release. Homosexuality is illegal in Malawi, as it is in most African nations, and government officials have said they are simply upholding the law. Activists in Malawi, however, say they are violating the country's constitution, which outlaws discrimination. The Malawi Law Society said the prosecution of the two men was driven by prejudice, not jurisprudence. Anthony Kamanga, Malawi's solicitor general and secretary for justice and constitutional affairs, said the law does not conflict with the constitution and has denied the charge of prejudice.","Malawi authorities split up gay couple jailed last week, activists say .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush condemned the escalated violence between Russia and U.S.-backed Georgia on Sunday, while Vice President Dick Cheney said aggression against Georgia ""must not go unanswered."" President Bush chats with Russian Prime Minister Vladmir Putin at the  start of the Olympic opening ceremonies. ""My administration has been engaged with both sides of this trying to get a ceasefire,"" Bush told NBC's Bob Costas in an interview in Beijing, China, where the president has attended Olympic events. Bush was filmed speaking to Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin during Friday's opening ceremonies and said Sunday that he ""was firm with Vladimir Putin"" and that ""this violence is unacceptable."" Violence has continued to rage between Russia and the western ally since Thursday, when Georgia launched an operation to crack down on separatists in South Ossetia territory. Russia said it wanted to protect its peacekeepers already in South Ossetia following ceasefires in years past. But Georgia called it a full-on invasion. And while Russia has accused Georgia of a genocidal plot to cleanse the region of ethnic Ossetians loyal to Russia, Georgia accuses Russia of executing a long-planned war with the aim of taking control of the region -- including a key pipeline that carries Asian oil to Black Sea ports. ""I expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of Russia,"" Bush said of his talk with Putin. ""We strongly condemn bombing outside of South Ossetia."" Putin says he's concerned about the flood of refugees arriving in Russia from South Ossetia. Russian officials said more than 30,000 refugees have left South Ossetia and crossed into Russia over the past two days, Interfax reported. ""The actions of the Georgian authorities in South Ossetia are a crime, of course, primarily a crime against their own people,"" Putin said, according to Russian news agency Interfax. Meanwhile, Cheney talked to Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili on Sunday, telling him that Russia's aggression against Georgia ""must not go unanswered."" Cheney's spokeswoman Lea Ann McBride said the vice president spoke to Saakashvili to express ""the United States' solidarity with the Georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity."" Georgia withdrew its forces Sunday and offered a ceasefire, which Russia refused. ""The vice president told President Saakashvili that Russian aggression must not go unanswered, and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the United States, as well as the broader international community,"" McBride said. Saakashvili has called on the United States and the world community to stop the ""intervention and invasion of my sovereign country."" ""I think the U.S. is the most powerful country in the world,"" he told CNN. ""I think the U.S. has lots of leverage. And I think there are lots of diplomatic means that it could be done through.""

"(CNN) -- One person was killed and 16 others hospitalized Saturday afternoon when a sports bar tent collapsed during a storm that swept through the St. Louis area, fire officials said. The man killed was identified Sunday as Alfred Goodman, a 58-year-old from Waterloo, Illinois, according to St. Louis police spokeswoman Schron Jackson. Five people suffered serious injuries. Nearly 100 others were treated at the scene, mostly for bruises, cuts, twisted ankles and one broken arm, officials said. They were all among St. Louis Cardinals baseball fans celebrating their team's victory over the Milwaukee Brewers at Kilroy's, a bar located just south of Busch Stadium that had a tent set up in the rear, according to fire Capt. Dan Sutter. Wind gusts estimated to be about 50 miles per hour lifted the tent, according to Eddie Roth, the city's public safety director. While the tent had received a city permit, manufacturer guidelines called for it to withstand winds of up to 90 miles per hour, said building commissioner Frank Oswald. Oswald said officials had not yet determined whether there was a manufacturing or installation failure. The fire marshal was to conduct an investigation into the incident. Up to 150 fans may have been under the tent, built of aluminum poles and guy wires, when the storm struck shortly before 4 p.m. (5 p.m. ET). ""We had live wires lying on the ground. We have severe injuries to quite a few people,"" said St. Louis Fire Chief Dennis Jenkerson. ""This gives us nightmares."" ""The music was loud and people had been in attendance at the ball game all afternoon,"" Deputy Fire Chief John Altmann told reporters. ""I don't think they were really aware of the seriousness of the situation."" The tent came to rest on a railroad trestle. The area had been under a severe thunderstorm watch, with a warning issued shortly before the incident. ""Anytime we put a lot of people in open areas and you have hazardous weather, it is a dangerous situation,"" Altmann said. Oswald said he believed the tent met manufacturer construction specifications. The city inspects such structures for fire safety and exit lights, but installation is up to the contractor. Inspectors were on site after the permit was issued earlier this month, according to Oswald. ""Like the chief said, it is important that people are aware of the weather situation,"" he said. ""These are temporary structures. They are certainly not designed to any stretch of the imagination to handle a severe weather event like this. Be aware of your surroundings and try to get somewhere safe."" Video shot by KSDK showed remains of the crumpled tent and dazed patrons standing outside. A strong thunderstorm north of the city produced golf-ball-sized and larger hail, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Jim Kramper. A tornado warning for downtown St. Louis expired before 7 p.m. CNN's Greg Morrison, Jacqui Jeras and Phil Gast contributed to this report.","NEW: The man killed is identified by police as Illinois resident Alfred Goodman, 58 .

"(CNN) -- Banking giant Citigroup has announced it is cutting a further 50,000 staff as the economic crisis worsens. Citigroup is rumored to be looking to cut staff in investment banking and wealth management divisions. It followed Japan's announcement Monday that the world's second largest economy had slipped into recession. The latest job cuts by Citigroup are yet another example of how the New York-based bank is desperately trying to cut costs in the wake of the credit crisis. Over the past four quarters, it has trimmed its payroll by 23,000 workers. In an investor presentation on its Web site, the company said it would reduce its staff levels to approximately 300,000 employees. As of the end of September, the New York City-based bank had about 352,000 workers. It was not clear from the presentation what parts of the company the cuts would come from, but there was speculation last week that Citigroup was looking to lay off people in its investment banking and wealth management divisions. Citigroup, the second largest U.S. bank by assets behind JPMorgan Chase, has been one of the hardest hit financial institutions during the credit crisis. Over the last four quarters, the company has lost more than $20 billion, due in large part to its ill-timed bets on the U.S. housing market. Its stock, which is down 68 percent so far this year, has lost about a third of its value in the last two weeks alone amid broader investor nervousness about the economy and the U.S. banking sector. Citigroup stock edged lower in pre-market trading Monday. There has also been speculation that big changes could come at the top of the organization. Last week, the The Wall Street Journal reported that the company was considering replacing chairman Win Bischoff. Citigroup's board sent a memo to all employees calling the report ""irresponsible and completely inaccurate"" however. The grim economic news continued to pile up Monday. Japan reported that its economy shrank by 0.1 percent in the third quarter; its second consecutive quarter of negative growth following a 0.9 percent drop in the second quarter. Japan's gross domestic product has fallen by 0.4 percent this year and the country joins a growing list of major economies in recession. On Friday, European Union officials said eurozone of 16 countries using the common currency was in recession. Germany -- Europe's single largest national economy -- is also in recession. Most economists expect the UK and the U.S. to join the list in the coming months. ""It's no surprise if you've been watching the numbers here,"" said CNN's Tokyo Correspondent Kyung Lah. ""But it crosses an important psychological barrier. This news is going to have an effect on the man on the street.""  Watch Kyung Lah discuss the reasons why Japan is in recesssion Â» . The Japanese economy has been badly hurt in recent weeks by the rising value of the yen, which investors have seen as a currency safe haven during recent economic turmoil that has wiped billions of dollars off the value of stocks. But that has had significant negative consequences on the export-dependent Japanese economy, driving up the price of Japanese electrical goods and cars overseas, driving down corporate profits and pitching the country into recession for the first time since 1991. Last month shares in Sony plunged when the electrical giant said it expected net profits to plunge 59 percent on deteriorating sales of gadgets and flat-screen TVs. Car manufacturers Honda, Nissan and Toyota have also suffered steep declines in sales and profits. In a further blow to the Japanese car industry, ailing U.S. auto giant General Motors announced Monday it was selling its 3 percent stake in Suzuki to raise $230 million in cash. Along with Ford and Chrysler, GM is seeking a $25 billion bailout from the U.S. government as the U.S. auto industry battles for survival amid the worst sales slump in more than 25 years. Japan's stock market has been one of the most badly hit by the downturn with more than 40 percent wiped off the value of the benchmark Nikkei. Monday's announcement had little apparent impact on trading with Tokyo stocks closing up 0.7 percent at 8,522.58. Elsewhere in Asia markets were mixed with Hong Kong's Hang Seng down slightly, Australian and Indian stocks tumbling and China's Shanghai Composite up 2.2 percent. In Europe, London, Frankfurt and Paris were all down between 2 and 3.3 percent. The Dow Jone, Nasdaq and S&P markets in the U.S. were also down between 2 and 3 percent, according to early tallies. Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso was among the leaders of the world's 20 largest economies who met in Washington over the weekend, unveiling a set of sweeping plans aimed at tackling the ever-expanding economic crisis. The G-20 members at the historic two-day meeting managed to find some common ground on the causes of the crisis and areas that need to be fixed after talks which U.S. President George W. Bush said had been ""an important first step."" The plans include interest rate cuts by central banks around the globe or potential economic stimulus packages, and boosting developing countries struggling under the weight of the crisis.  Watch Richard Quest discuss the G-20 agreement Â» . ""We must lay the foundation for reform to help ensure that a global crisis, such as this one, does not happen again,"" the leaders said in a joint statement. But critics said the statement had papered over major disagreements. The European bloc, representing Germany, France, the UK and the EU, is understood to be in favor of greater government regulation of financial and banking industries.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Friday urged high school students to e-mail, tweet, and teach their parents to tweet a message to Congress to prevent student loan interest rates from doubling on July 1. In his continuing push to extend the current 3.4% interest rate charged on federal student loans, Obama told students at a Virginia high school that the goal is to provide all Americans with the best possible education. ""We can't price the middle class out of a higher education,"" the president said, sounding a theme of his re-election campaign. ""That's why we've got to make college more affordable."" He made no mention of Mitt Romney, his all-but-certain opponent in November, but took aim at House Republicans who passed a measure last week that would pay for extending the lower student loan rate by cutting from a health care fund that promotes preventive care. Obama and Senate Democrats want to pay the measure's $6 billion cost by eliminating some corporate tax loopholes. In remarks almost identical to previous speeches to college students on the issue, Obama said America is not about a few people doing well while everyone else struggles. ""America's about giving everybody a chance to do well,"" he said to applause and cheers. ""That's what makes it strong. That's what the American dream's all about."" He urged the audience members to tell their elected officials what they think, saying that ""your voice can make a difference."" ""When I look at your faces, it gives me confidence about our future,"" the president said to loud cheers. ""I believe in you."" The White House warned last week that Obama would veto the student loan measure passed by House Republicans. The Senate will vote next week on its own version pushed by Democrats, and the two chambers are expected to then try to negotiate a compromise version.","Tweet your member of Congress, President Obama tells high school students .

"Aurora, Colorado (CNN) -- Colorado massacre suspect James Holmes applied to join a gun range in June, but the range's operator said Sunday that he was disturbed by the ""weird and bizarre"" message on Holmes' answering machine. ""It was weird,"" said Glenn Rotkovich, managing partner of the Lead Valley Range in Byers, Colorado. ""I didn't know what kind of message was left by this idiot. We need to know if he's an idiot before we let him have access to our range."" Rotkovich told CNN that Holmes sent in an online application on June 25. Rotkovich said he called the number Holmes left on the form, only to get a message he said was largely unintelligible. He said the voice was ""guttural, freakish, maybe drunk. Just weird and bizarre -- a deep, guttural, forced voice."" Paying tribute to the victims . Rotkovich said Holmes didn't call him back. He left another message, and said he was again disturbed by the voice on the machine. ""It bothered me so much I told my staff, 'If this guy shows up, he gets nothing until I meet him,' "" Rotkovich said. He said he tried calling Holmes a third time, again with no response, then quit. Holmes never called back, nor did he come to the range in Byers, about 40 miles east of Denver. But when news broke Friday of the bloodbath in a theater in the Denver suburb of Aurora, Rotkovich said one of his staffers remembered the name and saw that it matched reports of the suspect in the killings. Holmes, a 24-year-old doctoral student in neuroscience, was arrested outside the Century 16 multiplex early Friday. He's accused of opening fire in the crowded theater during a midnight screening of the new Batman movie, ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Shooting survivors recount Colorado horror . Pictures obtained of Holmes show a tall, bright-eyed, dark-haired young man, in contrast to the man a law enforcement official said had dyed his hair red and identified himself as ""the Joker"" after his arrest. And authorities recovered a Batman poster and mask from the apartment, a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the investigation said Sunday. It's an image difficult to reconcile for those who know him as a clean-cut, quiet graduate student. He entered the University of California, Riverside, in 2006 on a scholarship and graduated with highest honors with a bachelor's degree in neuroscience in 2010. ""Academically, he was at the top of the top,"" Chancellor Timothy P. White said. UC Riverside police have no record of any contact with Holmes, the university said. Neither did police at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, where Holmes enrolled in 2011 as a doctoral candidate in its neuroscience program at the Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, university officials said in a statement released Sunday. Holmes' sole brush with the law in Colorado appears to have been a 2011 summons for speeding from Aurora police. Holmes attended Colorado with the aid of a grant from the National Institutes of Health, which allowed the university to pay him a $26,000-a-year stipend for living expenses, university spokeswoman Jacque Montgomery said. A syllabus that lists Holmes as a student at the medical school shows that he may have taken a class in which he studied topics as diverse as substance abuse, schizophrenia, depression and other disorders. According to the document, he was to have delivered a presentation in May about microRNA biomarkers. But there are indications that something may have been amiss in Holmes' life in recent months. He withdrew from the program in June 2012, though ""he gave no reason for his withdrawal from the graduate school,"" said Jacque Montgomery, spokeswoman for the University of Colorado. It is not immediately clear if Holmes, who also worked in a paid position in the university's neuroscience research program, was still employed there after withdrawing from the program. He received a large volume of deliveries over the past four months to both his home and work addresses, which police believe begins to explain how he got his hands on some of the materials used in the rampage and the subsequent discovery of his booby-trapped apartment, Aurora Police Chief Paul Oates told reporters Saturday. Holmes purchased four weapons and more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition in recent months, Oates said. Police: Evidence of 'calculation,' 'deliberation' in Colorado shooting . Police haven't disclosed any motive for the attack or explained Holmes' appearance at the time of his arrest, citing an ongoing investigation. Holmes was dressed in black, wearing a ballistic helmet, a tactical ballistic vest, protective leggings, a throat and groin protector, and a gas mask during the attack, police said, and witnesses say they did not see his face because of the mask. Unlike most people his age, Holmes does not appear to have a social media footprint -- no accounts with Facebook, Twitter or Tumblr, though authorities are investigating whether he posted a profile on the sex website Adult Friend Finder. The profile contains a picture of a man with fiery red hair, a law enforcement source said. Police believe it may be a picture of Holmes, said the source, who was not authorized to speak to the media. The profile said it was created by a 24-year-old man from Aurora and has since been taken down. Adult Friend Finder said Sunday that it ""values the privacy of its members"" and would not confirm the identity of any users. The site will respond to police inquiries ""as may be required by law,"" company spokesman Lindsay Trivento said in a written statement. It's a profile that contrasts with news that Holmes worked as a counselor at a summer camp for needy children in 2008. Camp Max Straus caters to needy children ages 7-14, and is run by Jewish Big Brothers Big Sisters of Los Angeles, which confirmed his employment but would not offer further details or comment. The man who grew up in the upscale northwest San Diego neighborhood of Rancho PeÃÂ±asquitos was renting an apartment in Aurora, according to police and realty records. Tom Mai, a neighbor of the Holmes family in San Diego, described Holmes as ""clean-cut, quiet, responsible."" At the time of his arrest, Holmes was living in a small, three-story brick building on Paris Street in Aurora, in Apartment 10, within walking distance to the university. ""Neighbors report he lived alone and he kept to himself,"" Oates said. Jackie Mitchell, who lives close to Holmes, had a beer with him on Tuesday. Mitchell was stunned at news of Holmes' alleged involvement in the attack. ""You would never guess he was a violent guy,"" Mitchell said, describing Holmes as ""nerdish"" and ""a book-smart type guy."" Massacre suspect's neighbor: 'I'm counting my lucky stars' Holmes told police during his arrest he had booby-trapped the third-floor apartment, prompting investigators to evacuate the building and four others nearby and Friday and Saturday trying to disarm and get rid of a variety of explosive devices left behind. Kaitlyn Fonzi, a 20-year-old grad student and neighbor, said she heard techno music blasting from his apartment around the time of the shooting and had nearly opened Holmes' unlocked apartment door to complain -- unaware that the unit was wired to explode. A timer had turned the music on so that it would blare in his apartment after he left for the Aurora multiplex, according to a law enforcement source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.

"(CNN) -- The Mississippi Supreme Court on Thursday denied the state attorney general's attempt to have it reconsider its assent to controversial pardons -- several of them for convicted killers -- issued earlier this year by outgoing Gov. Haley Barbour. The decision was made ""without comment,"" court spokeswoman Beverly Pettigrew Kraft said by e-mail. Attorney General Jim Hood has been a harsh and persistent critic of the 214 pardons and clemencies issued by Barbour in January, shortly before the governor left office. Besides questioning whether some convicted of violent crimes should so easily walk free, he has argued some of the pardons were invalid because they did not meet a state constitutional requirement that notices be filed each day for 30 days in newspapers based where the crimes were committed. But Mississippi courts have consistently upheld the pardons. The state Supreme Court was among them, ruling in March that Barbour had complete power to pardon and his authority could not be challenged. In a statement afterward, Barbour said the decision ""reaffirmed more than a century of settled law in our state,"" but acknowledged that his pardons have been difficult for those who themselves or had family members victimized by those who went free. Hood, a Democrat, didn't give up his legal fight after that decision. In a brief filed with the state's high court later in March, he argued the case should be reheard because the ""private personal rights"" of the victims, as provided by the state constitution and Mississippi Crime Victims' Bill of Rights, were violated by the pardons. Barbour, who also is former chairman of the Republican National Committee, has said that he believes in redemption and that people deserve second chances. Most of the pardons involved convicts who had already served their time and have since been released from prison for their crimes, but four were convicted murderers who had worked as ""trusties"" at the governor's mansion. Victims' families have denounced the former governor for not meeting with them to discuss his reasons why he would show such leniency to these men. They included relatives of Tammy Ellis, who was gunned down by David Gatlin in 1993 as she held her 6-week-old son. Other convicted killers who, like Gatlin, received full pardons and were named in Hood's brief include Charles Hooker, who was convicted in a 1991 murder, and Anthony McCray, convicted in a 2001 murder. CNN's Rich Phillips contributed to this report.","Mississippi Supreme Court denies a bid to rehear a case on controversial pardons .

"(CNN) -- Retrospectives of Sally Ride's life over the next few days are likely to include the words ""ground-breaking,"" ""trailblazer,"" ""inspiration"" and ""mentor."" And rightly so. She epitomized these words and so many more. To me, she was also a classmate, a crewmate, a collaborator and a friend. Sally and I first crossed paths in the first grade at Hayvenhurst Elementary School in California in 1958, though neither of us remembered the other clearly. We had a good laugh as we pieced this together 20 years later, when we met as two of the first six women in NASA's astronaut corps. Sally Ride opens a new frontier for others . It wasn't the only similarity in our backgrounds. We shared a love for competitive sports, and our college careers revealed that we both loved arts and letters as much as the sciences. The second point paid many dividends later on, in great crossword challenges during crew quarantine and many shared lecture engagements. iReport: Sally Ride inspired me to dream . We six women in the Class of 1978 ranged in age from 39 (Shannon Lucid) to 26 (Sally and me). Underneath our different professional backgrounds and personal styles, we had many points in common: All six were intelligent, goal-oriented, creative and strong. We each hadchosen our career path because it suited our talents and fired our passion, not in pursuit of celebrity. Light Years: Tributes pour in for Sally Ride . But we found ourselves on a very different stage. We bonded as we took on the challenges that came with being the first six women in the U.S. astronaut corps, from the glare of the media spotlight to the everyday challenges of the workplace. We were keenly aware that what we did, and how we did it, would lay the ground for all the women who would come after us. We had to do it right. Which is not to say we couldn't have fun while we were at it. Sally was one of the quickest wits and keenest pranksters in our class. She was the master of the clever, perfectly timed retort. Sally Ride, first American woman in space, dies . A favorite memory is from our first morning in orbit in 1984. Mission Control woke us up with the standard mix of a bit of music and words to the effect of, ""Good morning, Challenger. Houston standing by."" Instead of the normal response, ""Roger,"" Sally launched into an answering machine reply: ""We're sorry nobody can take your call right now. Please leave your name and number..."" Our grins turned to guffaws when the Capcom replied with his name and a real phone number for Mission Control. We carried her joke on throughout the flight, with everyone taking turns at making up the morning's fake answering machine message. ""Why was Sally Ride tapped to fly first?"" is a question I've been asked many times in the past few days. The truth is, none of us ever knew, not even Sally. Whatever the reasons may have been, history will record that the selection turned out well indeed. Sally performed superbly on STS-7 and stepped into the role of first American woman to fly in space with intelligence, dignity and grace. Thank you, Sally Ride . With the distinction she earned in 1983, Sally was free to write her own ticket to life. That she chose to devote her energies to teaching and inspiring others to dream, to dare and to aspire to excellence speaks volumes about her character. She wanted to share her wonderment about the universe and joy of learning with others. She was committed to breaking down the cultural and educational barriers that block so many, especially young girls, from science and the opportunities it offers in life. And this she did, through her work as a physics professor, mentor, motivator and businesswoman. Sally's place in history is solidly established by her many contributions to science, spaceflight and the American space program. But I daresay her greatest legacy lies in her post-NASA work as an educator and a role model. Light Years: Memories of my space flight with Sally Ride .

"(CNN) -- Hospitals in at least eight states want to know how many hundreds or thousands of their patients have come in contact with a lab technician accused of spreading hepatitis C. The man, David Kwiatkowski, has the disease, which can pass through contact with contaminated blood, most often via shared needles. Authorities say the Michigan native injected himself with painkillers meant for patients when he worked at Exeter Hospital in New Hampshire and left the syringes for reuse. He was arrested this month in connection with spreading the disease at Exeter and has been charged with obtaining controlled substances by fraud and tampering with a consumer product, according to an affidavit filed in federal court. He is suspected of stealing fentanyl, a powerful analgesic that is substantially more potent than morphine, the affidavit said. Former hospital worker accused of transmitting hepatitis C . Thirty Exeter patients have been diagnosed with the same strain of hepatitis C that Kwiatkowski has. Now, officials want to be sure that outbreak has not spread past New England. Kwiatkowski, 33, worked as a traveling medical technician on a contract basis for hospitals in Arizona, Georgia, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, New York and Pennsylvania in the past five years, hospitals and health officials in those states confirmed. Asked Wednesday whether anyone in the health care industry ever reported anything about Kwiatkowski, he said: ""Many health care practitioners view drug diversion as a problem that requires treatment only. It does require treatment, but it's also incumbent on someone to report it to law enforcement authorities. This may be a big teaching moment for the industry."" Authorities in the states where Kwiatkowski worked want patients who may have come in contact with the man to be tested for the disease. Kwiatkowski told authorities he found out he had hepatitis C in May 2012, but further investigation revealed he tested positive for the disease in June 2010. Hepatitis C is considered to be among the most serious of hepatitis viruses. It is typically asymptomatic, going undetected until liver damage shows up, according to the Mayo Clinic website. New Hampshire's health department is asking that anyone who was a patient in Exeter's operating rooms and the intensive care unit between April 1, 2011, and May 25 of this year be tested. Those are two areas that Kwiatkowski visited during his ""routine duties to transport patients,"" Exeter Hospital said in a written statement. But it added that he ""was not involved with procedures or patient care."" The hospital said ""there is an extremely small chance that anyone will be found to have been infected with a hepatitis C strain that is genetically linked to Kwiatkowski outside of the Cardiac Catheterization Unit."" ""However, as we continue to learn about Kwiatkowski's history in other states from the ongoing criminal investigation, and out of an abundance of caution, Exeter Hospital supports the (health department's) decision to offer expanded testing to patients treated in these two other areas even though Kwiatkowski had no formal role supporting procedures in those areas."" Kacavas said his office interviewed employees at Exeter who said they had seen Kwiatkowski sweating profusely and with bloodshot eyes. ""One of them described him as unfit to provide medical care and his supervisor sent him home,"" Kacavas said. ""He provided a plausible explanation for his condition, which was that he had been crying his eyes out because his aunt had died and he was an emotional wreck."" According to state and hospital officials, he worked in as a radiology technician and in cardiac catheterization labs in the following locations: . -- Oakwood Annapolis Hospital in Wayne, Michigan, January to September 2007; . -- Saint Francis Hospital, Poughkeepsie, New York, November 2007 to February 2008; . -- UPMC Presbyterian, Pittsburgh, March 2008 to May 2008; . -- Baltimore Veterans Affairs Medical Center, May 2008 to November 2008; . -- Southern Maryland Hospital, Clinton, Maryland, December 2008 to February 2009; . -- Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, July 2009 to January 2010; . -- Maryland General Hospital, Baltimore, January 2010 to March 2010; . -- Temple University Hospital, Philadelphia, April 2010; . -- Hays Medical Center, Hays, Kansas, May 2010 to September 2010; . -- Houston Medical Center, Warner Robins, Georgia, October 2010 to March 2011. Arizona health authorities and Maricopa County, Arizona, public health officials have been told the man worked briefly in Maricopa County during 2009 and 2010 ""for a temporary health care staffing agency."" It is not known exactly where he worked. ""We are in the process of confirming details so that we may accurately inform the public of any potential risk and actions to take,"" said Bob England, director of the Maricopa County Department of Public Health . Johns Hopkins is calling in about 200 patients who had a procedure at the lab during the time Kwiatkowski worked there. About 460 patients had procedures at the lab in Kansas during Kwiatkowski's stint there. But the number of people who may be tested might change as officials peruse medical records and see who needs to be seen. These and the other institutions are calling old patients in and offering free testing. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is helping state health officers and hospitals tackle the problem. Like Exeter and New Hampshire, other hospitals and states are, as Johns Hopkins puts it, ""erring on the side of patient safety and contacting anyone who came in during that time."" ""He didn't necessarily have contact with all patients who were at the lab during that time period,"" said a statement from Johns Hopkins. Kansas Department of Health and Environment Secretary and State Health Officer Robert Moser said he understands patient concerns but is reassuring people that ""we have no reason to be concerned about additional risks to the public"" because Kwiatkowski worked in Kansas two years ago. Authorities across the United States want to know as much as they can about Kwiatkowski's whereabouts since he became infected. The New York health department asked the state's hospitals and radiology facilities to identify any place where Kwiatkowski might have worked since January 1, 2007, either as a facility employee or as a ""traveler"" employed by a contracting agency. Kwiatkowski was arrested earlier this month in a Massachusetts hospital where he was being treated. He is now being held in the Strafford County, New Hampshire, jail. He could face more than 20 years in prison if convicted. ""The evidence gathered to date points irrefutably to Kwiatkowski as the source of the hepatitis C outbreak at Exeter Hospital. With his arrest, we have eliminated the menace this 'serial infector' posed to public health and safety,"" U.S. Attorney John P. Kacavas in New Hampshire said. Kwiatkowski appeared in New Hampshire federal court Tuesday and waived his right to a detention hearing. Kacavas said it is possible more charges could be filed. A negligence complaint and a class action lawsuit have been filed in U.S. District Court in Omaha, Nebraska, against Triage Staffing, a health care company that hired and placed Kwiatkowski at Exeter. One of the cases, filed by Seabrook, New Hampshire, resident Robert Oliver Fowler claimed Kwiatkowski was negligently hired and retained. ""Triage failed to exercise reasonable care in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the job Mr. Kwiatkowski was to perform at Exeter Hospital. Triage failed to exercise the degree of care required related to the severity of risk to Mr. Fowler. Triage knew or should have known of Mr. Kwiatkowski's likelihood of causing harm to Mr. Fowler when it supervised Mr. Kwiatkowski. Triage failed to conduct a reasonable investigation that could have found Mr. Kwiatkowski's likelihood of causing harm to Mr. Fowler,"" the suit said. Joe M. Grillo, a spokesman for Triage Staffing, told CNN in an e-mail that ""we are aware of issues involving a former contract medical technologist at Exeter Hospital. Given that there is an ongoing criminal investigation, as well as pending civil litigation, it would be inappropriate for us to comment at this time."" Fowler's attorney, Domenic Paolini of Boston, said firms like Triage need to perform due diligence in vetting employees. At present, he said, a cashier at a hardware store gets ""more scrutiny"" for hiring than people working in important health care jobs. Firms that employ traveling health care workers need to rethink their hiring procedures, he said, and ""hospital policies and procedures need to be changed as well.""

"(CNN) -- When Mitt Romney took the stage at the annual VFW convention Tuesday, he had a chance to finally offer serious ideas for strengthening U.S. foreign policy and how, if elected president, he would keep our nation secure. He didn't take it. Missing yet another opportunity to show meaningful leadership, the former Massachusetts governor instead chose to offer more empty rhetoric cloaked in patriotic bravado. His campaign appears more focused on mocking the successful foreign policy of President Barack Obama, who has undoubtedly made America safer, than on revealing exactly how a Romney administration would engage with the world. Refusing to acknowledge our nation's recent successes in global leadership, Romney again on Tuesday pivoted to the shallow rhetoric at the core of his campaign: boasts of American exceptionalism with no mention of partnership with our allies; promises of radically increased military spending without clarity about its mission; and provocative language toward countries such as China and Russia that even a member of his own party has criticized. Romney camp disavows anonymous quote in British paper . Tuesday's speech served as a clear reminder of why Romney so rarely speaks of national security, which is normally a sacred and central issue for Republican candidates. Perhaps it's because when he does, he says things such as ""Russia is our No. 1 geopolitical foe."" Romney has done little to show he has the judgment and vision to lead and protect this nation in a dangerous world. He seems to know it, too, and has surrounded himself with an array of Bush administration veterans, most of whom are best known for their roles in sending the United States into a war in Iraq that has cost this nation trillions of dollars and the lives of 4,488 brave members of the U.S. military. Roughly 70% of Romney's foreign policy team comes from the Bush/Cheney neo-con all-star team. His few foreign policy quips on the stump and his unwillingness to stand apart from the Bush administration's high-profile failures raise serious questions about the direction he would lead U.S. foreign policy as president. So far during this campaign, Romney has threatened a trade war with China and has vowed to increase the military's budget by a staggering $2.1 trillion over the next 10 years, although he won't say how he'll pay for it or what he'll do with the additional spending. He has repeatedly criticized Obama's plan to bring U.S. forces home from Afghanistan by 2014, only to eventually endorse that strategy in his speech Tuesday. Is Romney getting Swift-boated? Romney has said he'd simply refuse to negotiate with the Taliban and instead would pursue and target each of its members across the world. That's a strategy that even Bush's national security adviser, Stephen Hadley, has said is a bad idea. Romney's record of reckless rhetoric stands in sharp contrast with Obama's successful foreign policy and national security strategy -- one that doesn't rely solely on strong military action but smartly invests in diplomacy and development and focuses on real threats instead of political convenience. Under Obama's leadership, we have destroyed al Qaeda's leadership and ended Osama bin Laden's reign of terror. Obama has fulfilled his promise to get U.S. forces out of Iraq and set a course out of Afghanistan, wisely focusing U.S. resources on more urgent threats to our national security. He has stood firmly by our friend, Israel, deepening our defense and security partnership and taking strong steps to deter Iran from developing a nuclear weapons capability. He has repaired our alliances and restored America's standing and credibility in the world -- as a leader not only in force but in values. Romney calls for a change in hearts, not gun laws . Without question, Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have made our country safer. They have led a national security strategy that is wisely cautious and stands in sharp contrast with Romney's wildly dangerous rhetoric. If Romney has any serious ideas about how to make the United States safer, now is the time for him to offer them. If he is to lead our country, or even just his party, Romney must move past applause lines and catch up to a world that has moved on from Cold War-style fear mongering and feckless grandstanding. Voters should demand better from a man who would be president. Romney walks political tightrope on foreign policy . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Chris Coons.","Chris Coons: Romney's speech was empty rhetoric cloaked in patriotic bravado .

"London (CNN) -- British field hockey authorities have been forced to apologize ""unreservedly"" to South Africa after an old national anthem from the days of apartheid was played before an international game this week. Great Britain Hockey called the mistake ""sensitive"" and ""unfortunate."" ""It was completely shocking,"" the chief executive of South Africa hockey said of hearing the pre-1994 anthem ""Die Stem"" being played before Tuesday's game in London. ""I thought, 'What is that?' And when I listened further, I realized it was 'Die Stem.' I couldn't believe my ears,"" Marissa Langeni said Thursday. Some of the younger players on the team didn't even know what song was being played, she said. The anthem dates from the days of white minority rule over South Africa. A new national anthem, ""Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika,"" meaning ""God Bless Africa,"" was added alongside it when Nelson Mandela became president in 1994, and the two songs were combined in 1997. ""For the majority of South Africans, we don't relate to that anthem,"" Langeni said. ""It was the anthem of a small section of our community. It's as good as not having played an anthem."" ""If they flew the old flag of the country, I would be equally surprised,"" she said. Tournament organizer Great Britain Hockey on Wednesday published ""a full and unreserved apology to the South African women's hockey team and their supporters for mistakenly playing the wrong national anthem before South Africa's match with Great Britain."" GBH Chief Operating Officer Sally Munday blamed the mistake on ""a contractor responsible for sports presentation at the event."" She said organizers had not checked the anthem in advance and took full responsibility for the mistake. Langeni said she was very satisfied with the apology, calling the error ""a bit of an administrative blunder.""

"(CNN) -- The Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng's daring and extraordinary escape to the U.S. embassy in Beijing has captivated the world. At first, it appeared that U.S. diplomats and the Chinese government brokered a deal that satisfied Chen and everyone involved. But now Chen says he wants to leave China, and that he feels unsafe. Has the Obama administration bungled his case? Did President Barack Obama use people who were capable of correctly interpreting the signals in China? Or was there a gap in translation? Possible breakthrough for blind activist . We learned earlier this week that Chen was released from the U.S. Embassy with the Chinese government's assurance of his ""safety"" and a promise to facilitate his study of law in an unspecified place outside his home province of Shandong. It sounded like a win-win solution. But those who have intimate knowledge of China and its political system had reasons to worry. In many ways, the deal was almost made to be broken, because it was based on three erroneous assumptions on the part of American officials. The first false assumption is that the Chinese government's assurances are ironclad. To be sure, there has to be some trust among negotiators. But the Chinese government has meted out overly harsh treatment to dissidents in recent years. What confidence do we have that it will make an exception in Chen's case? The American trust that the Chinese government will honor its promises was misplaced, if not outright naÃÂ¯ve. Behind the scenes of the Chen drama . Second, U.S. officials assumed the word ""safety"" means the same thing for both sides. The Chinese negotiators may have had a totally different arrangement in mind when they spoke of safety. For them, Chen was ""safe"" when he was confined in his home in Shandong, surrounded by armies of security guards. Third, the United States should not have thought of the case as just zealous local Shandong officials abusing their power when they confined Chen. It is hard to believe that Shandong officials did what they did to Chen, a high profile activist, without consent from above. That local officials from elsewhere will not abuse their power is hard to believe. Would Chen not be viewed as a threat to ""stability"" by his handlers once he enters a Chinese university? Some China observers have pointed out that Chen can only blame himself for insisting to stay in China as a cornerstone of the deal. They are disappointed by his change of mind. Chen certainly knows the Chinese political system the best among those involved in the negotiation. So he should have expected the threats he may face if he stays in China. But, for a blind and ill person who had just escaped from a long detention with little contact with the outside world, isn't it too much to ask that he make the most rational decision? And how could he opt to leave China when his family was in the hands of Chinese officials who could have caused them harm? There is no easy fix to the predicament. Taking Chen out of China would have been a good solution, but that possibility may be receding. The U.S. officials who were involved with the negotiations should have recognized the potential problems in the deal and expected the treatment that Chen would encounter after leaving the U.S. Embassy. If they are not well equipped to do so (despite the fact that some of them are ethnically Asian), then where are their China hands? While we don't know how the Chen case will ultimately turn out, for the United States, it's time to think strategically of enlisting more advisers from a new generation of China scholars. There are political scientists teaching at elite universities in the United States who are more than qualified to advise the State Department on sensitive diplomatic issues. These scholars were born and grew up in China and may have worked in the Chinese government before coming to the United States. They have expertise on Chinese politics and society that is hard to come by, because they can see things from the perspective of the Chinese. In the coming years, the United States will have more success in dealing or negotiating with China if it recruits more experts who really understand how China works. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Yang Su.","The deal the U.S. and China made over Chen Guangcheng appears to be unraveling .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Demonstrators angry that ousted strongman Hosni Mubarak's former premier will face off against a representative of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt's presidential runoff have called for more protests Tuesday. On Monday, several thousand protesters in Tahrir Square called on Egyptian courts to disqualify former Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik, chanting, ""Where is the revolution?"" Others ransacked Shafik's campaign headquarters and set it ablaze after learning that he was one of the two candidates who made it through the first round of voting. The June 16-17 runoff will pit Shafik against Muslim Brotherhood candidate Mohamed Morsi. Morsi received 5.7 million votes, followed by Shafik's 5.5 million, according to Egypt's election commission. Shafik campaign spokesman Ahmed Serhan said the fire was soon contained and no one was injured. Serhan said that while the anti-Shafik protesters numbered in the dozens, ""supporters in the hundreds are outside the building supporting him."" In Tahrir Square, the epicenter of the 2011 revolt, the crowd carried Khaled Ali -- a presidential candidate who failed to make the runoff -- on their shoulders while demanding an end to the military government that followed Mubarak. Anti-Shafik protests were also reported in Alexandria and other cities, and revolutionary leaders said they would hold more on Tuesday outside Egypt's High Court of Justice. Voters' dilemma: Choice between two tyrants? In all, 23 million of Egypt's 50 million eligible voters, or 46%, cast ballots in the first round of the election. Thirteen candidates appeared on the first-round ballot, though two withdrew from the race after ballots were printed. The winner of the landmark vote will become Egypt's first freely elected president. Neither of the frontrunners had been favored by the revolutionaries responsible for toppling Mubarak. Morsi is an American-educated engineer who has promised to stand for democracy, women's rights and peaceful relations with Israel if he emerges as the victor. Still, he's an Islamist figure who has argued for barring women from the Egyptian presidency and called Israeli leaders ""vampires"" and ""killers."" Though the Brotherhood played little role in the revolution, its well-honed political machine succeeded in getting its supporters to the polls. Meanwhile, many of those who faced down the Mubarak regime at Tahrir Square did not follow up with the political organizing that would have been needed to gain electoral victory. Shafik, a former air force officer with close ties to Egypt's powerful military, has attempted to distance himself from Egypt's deposed leader. He told reporters last week that there's ""no going back"" to the Mubarak years. Still, he appealed to those who may have had second thoughts about the magnitude of the change that has swept across the country. The uncertainty has had an impact: Last week, the Cairo stock market plunged by 3% in a single day. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who led a delegation observing the voting, told reporters last week in Cairo that he couldn't say ""the entire process has been proper"" because of restraints on observers. But the group found the election period to be peaceful, with citizens accepting the voting process as ""quite successful."" ""There were many violations, and I think each violation is serious. But I think collectively they did not affect the basic integrity of the election,"" he said. Carter said there were no apparent patterns in election procedures that ""favored a particular candidate."" Mubarak led the North African nation for 30 years before being forced out last year amid a popular outcry that marked one of the seminal developments of the Arab Spring. Distrust and anger in Egypt, particularly against the military's power in governmental affairs, have inspired continued protests, some of which have been marked by deadly clashes. Many protesters are upset about what they see as the slow pace of reform since Mubarak's ouster. Some are also concerned that the country's military leadership is delaying the transition to civilian rule. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces has insisted that it will hand over power to an elected civilian government. In January, two Islamist parties -- the Freedom and Justice Party with 235 seats and the conservative Al Nour party with 121 seats -- won about 70% of the seats in the lower house of parliament in the first elections for an elected governing body in the post-Mubarak era. The rest of the assembly's 498 seats were divided among other parties. CNN's Ben Wedeman and journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","Ex-Mubarak premier Shafik's headquarters is set ablaze .

"(EW.com) -- This year, Showtime's ground-breaking TV series ""Weeds"" will come to a close. The premium network will conclude series creator Jenji Kohan's acclaimed pot comedy after eight seasons. Weeds helped pave the way for other daring cable shows and made Showtime a competitive force in the original series game.

""I'm so proud of what we do here and that it's about a strong woman lead who's really flawed,"" she says of her protagonist, Nancy Botwin (Parker). ""We get to do comedy right up against drama, which a lot of shows don't get the opportunity to do."" The final season will quickly resolve this year's assassination attempt cliffhanger, and fans can expect a time jump and a return to the suburbs. Beyond that, Kohan hasn't yet decided how to conclude Nancy's tale. ""We wrack our brains every year for crazy cliffhangers and we're trying to figure out how to top ourselves,"" she says. Showtime and ""Weeds''"" studio Lionsgate Television Group have full faith that Kohan will deliver a stellar final batch of episodes. ""No matter how close she's gone to the edge of everything falling apart, she reels the story back in, grounds it, and brings you back,"" says Lionsgate TV Group president Kevin Beggs. ""It's an art form."" Weeds premiered in 2005 and, along with other titles, pioneered an edgy adult-cable programming renaissance that not only boosted Showtime but inspired similar risk-taking content on networks. Weeds particularly broke ground with Parker's Golden Globe-winning portrayal of a suburban pot-dealing matriarch, a performance that was later followed by other female anti-hero programs like Showtime's ""Nurse Jackie"" and FX's ""Damages."" ""From a creative standpoint, the show broke a bunch of barriers,"" Beggs says. ""It became one of the most talked about cable comedies and ushered in a new era. Jenji's unique voice skewered hypocrisy; whether attitudes towards drug use, racism, sexism or suburbia."" The final season of ""Weeds"" premieres Sunday, July 1 at 10 p.m. on Showtime.

"(CNN) -- Lego boss Jorgen Vig Knudstorp, who pulled the iconic toy brand back into profit, says Europe needs to face up to its harsh economic reality. Knudstorp believes Europeans think they are wealthier than they are, despite three years of a global financial crisis. With the crisis continuing to roil markets and destabilize the banking sector, ""it's about all of us recognizing that we have lost a bit of our wealth,"" he says. Lego lost its way in the late 90s and went deeply into debt before rebounding to double digit growth under Knudstorp's leadership. Knudstorp suggests European finance ministers could learn from Danish manufacturer's experience. ""My piece of advice would be: face the truth -- that is what I learned the hard way in our company."" Knudstorp says Lego went too deeply into debt, as Europe has also done. According to Knudstorp, stemming the crisis will begin by saying: ""Yes we are over-indebted, we are sorry, we screwed up."" He believes Europe needs to write-off some of its debt to avoid a stagnant economy for the next decade. ""I think we are moving from a 30 year period of just borrowing more and more money at the government level and also at the household level,"" Knudstorp says. However, he says, Europe is entering a phase where raw material costs could increase while the availability for cheap labor around the world will decline. At Lego, Knudstorp will be focused on ensuring the company adapts to the changing economic conditions, which he believes are crucial to ensure survival. Lego is also renewing its portfolio of products, and plans to launch toys specifically designed for girls. But Knudstorp also emphasis the needs to keep things simple. ""You need to challenge your organization all the time, to stay coherent, not make things too complicated,"" he says. ""A lot of productivity is lost inside the company when things get complicated."" CNN's Emily Smith has contributed to this report.","The boss of Lego says Europe needs to face up to its harsh economic reality .

"(CNN) -- Army troops and rebels clashed on Wednesday in the violence-ridden eastern part of Congo, threatening to undermine an already fragile stability. Hundreds of people in North Kivu fled toward the city of Goma by road trying to escape the fighting. The sound of heavy artillery echoed through the hills. The Congolese army continued a second day offensive to recover the cities of Rugari and Rumangavo, and to takeover these positions held by the insurgency. ""The situation is deteriorating because of the fighting between various groups,"" said Ronald Paul Veilleux, the International Rescue Committee's provincial director for North and South Kivu. As of January 2009, an estimated 1.5 million people in North and South Kivu provinces have been internally displaced, and the number continues to rise, according to the United Nations. ""People are losing their homes, their livelihoods and their hope,"" Veilleux said. The massive displacement has also led to an increase in gender-based violence. According to Veilleux, reported cases have gone up by 75% nationwide since April, and many go unreported in a nation that is already known as the rape capital of the world. In addition, this past week the World Health Organization reported a sharp increase in the number of cholera cases in North Kivu. ""There is potential for this to turn into an epidemic if the situation continues to deteriorate,"" said Veilleux. The eastern part of Congo has been embroiled in violence since 1994, when Hutu forces crossed the border fearing reprisals following the genocide in neighboring Rwanda. In 1998 the vast nation -- previously known as Zaire -- became a battleground for eight African countries. More than 5 million people died in the war and its aftermath, making it the deadliest conflict since World War II. Despite the signing of peace accords in 2003, fighting continues in the eastern part of Congo between various rebel groups and the Congolese army, which is back by U.N. peacekeepers. There are many different forces on the ground, all of whom are armed. ""The fighting is like a view through a kaleidoscope,"" said John Campbell, an Africa expert with the Council on Foreign Relations. Amid growing concerns of an escalating conflict, the U.S. government announced last week that it will cut military aid to Rwanda. The United States has accused Rwanda of supporting rebels in Congo. ""The United States government is deeply concerned about the evidence that Rwanda is implicated in the provision of support to Congolese rebel groups, including M23,"" said Hilary Fuller Renner, a State Department spokeswoman. The M23 -- named after a failed peace agreement signed on March 23 three years ago -- is a rebel group that split from the Congolese army earlier this year. It has been accused of killing hundreds of people. One of the M23 commanders, Bosco Ntaganda, is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes. In a report to the U.N. Security Council in June, a U.N. expert panel on Congo found ""substantial evidence"" attesting to support from Rwandan officials to armed groups operating in the eastern region. It documents a ""systematic pattern of military and political support provided to the M23 rebellion by Rwandan authorities"" in the form of recruits, weapons and military equipment. Rwanda has denied allegations that the M23 are backed by their country's Tutsi leadership. ""As we have made clear from the outset, Rwanda is neither the cause nor the enabler of instability in the eastern (Congo),"" said Louise Mushikiwabo, Rwanda's foreign minister. Journalist Gemma Parellada contributed to this report.","Army troops and rebels clashed on Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- A boy labeled the youngest detainee in Bahrain's prison system has been released pending trial, one of his lawyers said Tuesday. The boy, Ali Hasan, was arrested on May 14 and accused of participating in an ""illegal gathering"" with about a dozen others, according to the Bahrain International Affairs Authority, the Persian Gulf kingdom's information office. Authorities accuse him of burning tires at a roadblock. Human rights groups say he is 11 years old. Authorities say he is 12. Defense attorney Mohsin Al-Alawi said he recently visited Hasan and the boy told him that he didn't take part in an ""illegal gathering."" The boy sobbed, said he is tired and wanted to go home, Al-Alawi said Monday. Human rights groups had been demanding his release and say he was arrested as the country continues to crack down on anti-government protesters. Another attorney, Shahzalan Khamees, said Tuesday the boy was released Monday without bail or restrictions, on the promise that he would appear to face trial on June 20. ""Since he was detained, he has one phrase that does not change: 'I want to go home.' Now he is home with his parents and siblings,"" Khamees said. The lawyer hopes the case will be dismissed, he said. ""He is a child, and under international law children cannot be tried. They can make a mistake, but they cannot be legally tried for their actions,"" Khamees said. ""The police record states that they saw a bag of garbage in the street and blamed him for using it to block the street,"" he said. Authorities should be ""more than satisfied"" with the time Hasan has spent in jail ""and the damage they have caused to the boy by imprisoning him,"" Khamees said. Bahrain needs to treat children better, he added: ""These are just children. They should be allowed to move like birds from one area to the next without fear of being trapped."" Authorities said Monday that Hasan was ""receiving social care and tutoring at the (detention) center. He completed his last exam of the sixth grade level on Thursday."" The Bahrain Rehabilitation and Anti-Violence Organization, an Ireland-based rights group, said Monday that there are a ""growing number of children detained for investigation in security cases."" The Bahrain Center for Human Rights also accused the government of targeting children under age 15 in its crackdown. The rights group said Hasan is the youngest detainee in Bahrain's prison system. The government did not immediately respond to the allegation. Bahrain has been heavily criticized by rights groups for its crackdown on anti-government protests that began February 14, 2011, in the country -- spurred by popular uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt. But the protests failed to gain the traction of other Arab Spring uprisings after a crackdown in February and then again in mid-March of last year by Bahraini authorities -- backed by troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Demonstrators and Bahraini authorities have continued to clash, with the opposition accusing the government of being heavy-handed in its crackdown on protests. In November, Bahrain's Independent Commission of Inquiry issued a report highly critical of the crackdown. The commission, set up by the king, concluded that police had used excessive force and torture during last year's crackdown. The report recommended reforms to the country's laws and better training of its security forces. CNN's Saad Abedine contributed to this report.","Ali Hasan is freed but must return for trial later this month, his lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- After days of international shuttling on what to do with the troubling situation in Syria, Russia's foreign minister said Saturday his country will never agree to foreign intervention. Despite warnings of Syria spiraling into a civil war, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said at a televised briefing in Moscow there was no alternative other than implementing Special Envoy Kofi Annan's peace plan, despite its failures. ""The situation looks more and more grim,"" Lavrov said. ""For the first time since the beginning of this crisis we see the question of foreign intervention. And our position remains unchanged. We will never agree to sanction the use of force in the U.N. Security Council."" Opinion: The only glimmer of hope for Syria . He called foreign intervention a ""dangerous game"" and said it would have serious consequences in the entire region. He also blamed the recent violence, which has included horrific reported massacres in Houla and Qubeir, in part to opposition groups being supported by other nations. Russia, along with China and four Central Asian nations, has signed a joint declaration rejecting armed intervention in Syria and reiterating support for Annan's peace plan. Russia and China -- both Security Council members -- have also blocked proposed United Nations efforts to punish President Bashar al-Assad's regime with sanctions. Lavrov suggested an international conference on Syria to work out a way to make the peace plan stick. That conference, he said, should include Iran and not focus on regime change in Syria. ""If the Syrians agree [on Assad's departure] between each other, we will only be happy to support such a solution,"" Lavrov said. ""But we believe it is unacceptable to impose the conditions for such a dialogue from outside."" Lavrov's comments came on a day when intense fighting flared across Syria and after many hours of international discussions this week on how to get the failing peace plan back on track. At least 96 people, including many women and children, were killed Saturday, said the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria. Many of the reported deaths were in Daraa, a southern city near the Jordanian border that the opposition group said was raided and shelled starting Friday night. ""Several doctors have been detained to prevent them from aiding the wounded amid a state of panic among residents due to the abuses regime forces are committing against the people there,"" the group said. A doctor in the besieged city of Al Qusayr, near the Lebanese border, said he has to keep moving his makeshift hospital to prevent attack. Journalist Robert King documented the chaos in the hospital on video as medical staff rushed to save lives. King said he has seen snipers targeting children. The city of Homs came under heavy bombardment Saturday. Regime forces stormed one neighborhood amid intense gunfire and shelled a mosque and church, the Local Coordination Committees said. At least 26 people died in Homs, including the mayor of the Khalidiya neighborhood, according to the group. It said another 26 people died in Idlib. Another opposition group, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported a total of 17 government forces were killed in clashes with rebels across the country. CNN cannot independently confirm reports of casualties or violence as the Syrian government has restricted access by international journalists. In another sign of escalating attacks, rebels battled government forces in the heart of Damascus on Friday, sparking fierce explosions in a rare and bold move for the fighters, video purportedly from the scene showed. Meanwhile, the Syrian government said an ""armed terrorist group"" was behind an attack on a power station in a Damascus neighborhood Friday. Firefighters extinguished the fire and crews are working to restore electricity to affected areas. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) reported that the bodies of 57 policemen and soldiers -- many of them officers -- were transported from military hospitals in several cities to funerals in hometowns. International leaders accuse al-Assad of failing to comply with a peace plan brokered by Annan, a special envoy on Syria for the United Nations and the Arab League. Annan, who has been meeting with U.N. officials, is trying to salvage the peace plan to end the 15-month anti-government uprising. As part of the plan, U.N. observers have been in Syria to monitor whether both sides are abiding by the agreement. Friday, the observers made it to the site of what the opposition called a massacre Wednesday in the village of Qubeir, near Hama, after they were denied access a day earlier by government forces and civilians in the area, said Sausan Ghosheh, spokeswoman for the U.N. Supervision Mission in Syria. The U.N. team found signs of an attack in the village, including some homes damaged by rockets, grenades and a range of other weapons, Ghosheh said. There also were tracks left by armored fighting vehicles that were visible in the vicinity, she said. The observers found the village empty, and observers were not able to talk to anyone who witnessed Wednesday's ""horrific tragedy,"" Ghosheh said. She said the circumstances surrounding this attack are still unclear, and that the number and names of those killed are still unconfirmed. The LCC alleges at least 78 people were killed in Qubeir, while the Syrian government blamed terrorists for the attack that it says killed only nine people. The Syrian state news agency discounted the opposition account of what happened in Qubeir, citing in its report a witness from the village who claimed to have seen armed terrorist groups carry out the attack. The government's claim contradicts that of the opposition, who accused government forces of shelling the village for an hour before militias on foot turned AK-47 rifles on people, some at close range, or slashed them with knives. Some residents suspected the Shabiha, armed gangs that work as freelancers for the government, the opposition said. A video purporting to show the carnage was posted on YouTube. It did not show who carried out the actual killings. CNN could not independently verify its authenticity. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali and Saad Abedine contributed to this report.","NEW: An opposition group reports 96 people killed across Syria on Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Attorneys for one of the victims Jerry Sandusky was convicted of abusing have released two voice mails that they say the former coach left on their client's phone just prior to his 2011 arrest -- potential fodder for a civil lawsuit they now plan to file against Penn State and others. The recordings are allegedly among ""numerous voice mails"" unearthed during an investigation, and were left on the phone of a person identified as Victim 2, attorneys with the firm Ross Feller Casey said in a statement Thursday. CNN cannot independently verify the recordings after listening to them posted on the attorneys' website. The group would not elaborate on how many voice mails were uncovered. Penn State board member resigns over Sandusky scandal . They are dated September 12 and September 19, 2011, less than two months before Sandusky was arrested on sex abuse charges. Both messages end with the words ""love you"" to the victim. In a message dated September 19, the former coach apparently says he's ""just calling to see -- you know -- whether you had any interest in going to the Penn State game this Saturday."" ""As these messages indicate, Sandusky was attempting to exert control over our client even as his arrest for child sexual abuse became imminent,"" the statement said. In 2001, then-graduate assistant Mike McQueary testified that he told his university superiors he saw Sandusky abusing Victim 2, then a minor, in a Penn State shower room. The firm also announced Thursday that it intends to file a civil lawsuit against ""Penn State University and others and to hold them accountable for the egregious and reckless conduct that facilitated the horrific abuse our client suffered."" Penn State insurer seeks to deny coverage . Penn State spokesman David La Torre responded to the announcement Thursday by saying the school ""takes these cases very seriously, but cannot otherwise comment on pending litigation."" ""President Erickson and the Board of Trustees have publicly emphasized that their goal is to find solutions that rest on the principle of justice for the victims,"" he said. Karl Rominger, Sandusky's attorney, said that the defense had expected ""people coming out of the woodwork with accusations."" ""Victim 2's identity was known to the defense and the prosecution prior to trial and the statements that the individual gave to an FBI trained investigator who worked for the defense team contradicted what he's now claiming,"" he said. ""We had already talked to Victim 2, which we mentioned at the presser at the preliminary hearing, and he told (defense attorney) Joe Amendola that nothing had happened."" Sandusky, who has maintained his innocence, was convicted in June for abusing young boys over a 15-year-period.

"(CNN) -- Whether you can take a vacation or not, you can always rely on the weeks between Memorial Day and Labor Day to offer up books you can escape with. This summer's slate of beach (or relaxing-locale-of-your-choice) reads include debuts from fresh voices as well as the return of familiar favorites. We've whittled down the hottest releases to 10, with help from the well-read folks at Publishers Weekly, Amazon and the independent Parnassus Books in Nashville. If we were you, we'd pencil in some time in the hammock now: . 1. ""Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk"" by Ben Fountain . Often referred to as the "" 'Catch-22' of the Iraq war,"" Ben Fountain's debut novel follows a squad of eight soldiers, including 19-year-old Spc. William Lynn, as they wind down their two-week ""Victory Tour"" with an appearance at a Dallas Cowboys' Thanksgiving Day game. Reviewers have praised Fountain's combination of comedy with the harsh realities of war, and Parnassus Books put its recommendation bluntly: . ""We got an (advanced copy) of the book back in January, and we all read it and were blown away,"" said Tristan Hickey, bookseller and floor manager of the shop. ""The humor in the book is astounding; it's humor with some very profound emotions behind it. If (Fountain) didn't immediately make a splash, we'd be happy to help make it."" 2. ""Bring Up the Bodies"" by Hilary Mantel . After the spectacular reception of 2009's ""Wolf Hall,"" readers have been eagerly awaiting the second installment of Hilary Mantel's fictional take on Henry VIII's reign through the eyes of Thomas Cromwell. Cromwell, said Publishers Weekly Fiction Reviews Editor Mike Harvkey, is a ""little older"" in book two but ""more powerful"" as he plots the removal of Anne Boleyn from the throne. As with ""Wolf Hall,"" Mantel's ""Bring Up the Bodies"" is in present tense, which is great for a summer read because the book has an ""immediacy,"" Harvkey said. ""I think you're going to see this in six out of 10 hands on the subway."" And, bonus: You don't have to read ""Wolf Hall"" if you want to dive right in to this. 3. ""My Cross to Bear"" by Gregg Allman . There are celebrity memoirs that give you the sanitized side of show business, and then there are the ones that strive for more. Gregg Allman's falls intp the latter category, Harvkey said. Along with Alan Light, Allman, the lead singer of American rock band the Allman Brothers, pulls back the curtain on his life as a musician while poignantly reflecting on his relationship with his brother, Duane, who died in 1971. ""Like all great memoirs, Allman really laid himself bare in this,"" Harvkey said. ""He takes readers through tragedy but with a focus always on the music and just sort of surviving. Even though it's got a lot of darkness ... it's a great read."" 4. ""Gone Girl"" by Gillian Flynn . On the surface, acclaimed writer Gillian Flynn's ""Gone Girl"" has the makings of a true-crime TV movie: a husband and wife (Nick and Amy, in this case) whose five years of matrimony have taken several turns for the worse as they battle infidelity, dishonesty and money issues in Missouri. And then, on their fifth anniversary, Amy disappears while the fingers begin to point in Nick's direction. That setup is enticing enough, but Flynn still has more to offer. As the New York Times' Janet Maslin writes in her review, ""Gone Girl"" is ""wily, mercurial, subtly layered and populated with characters so well imagined that they're hard to part with."" A smart, juicy read with well-hidden clues? We'll take that with a spiked lemonade, please. 5. ""Barack Obama: The Story"" by David Maraniss . Few books get a better tease than the musings of a current president's former girlfriend, which is exactly what David Maraniss' biography of President Barack Obama received ahead of its June 19 release. Vanity Fair published an excerpt in June about the woman Obama dated as a young man in New York, which was adapted from Maraniss' text, a biography that looks at the world and circumstances that shaped the 44th president we know today. 6. ""The Age of Miracles"" by Karen Thompson Walker . Karen Thompson Walker's debut novel, ""The Age of Miracles,"" has become a must-read ahead of its June 26 release. It's a coming-of-age tale told from the perspective of a 10-year-old girl living in California whose world is thrown literally out of whack after a massive earthquake, explained Amazon.com's Senior Editor of Books Chris Schluep. ""The earthquake knocks the Earth off its axis, so the Earth begins to slow down,"" he described. ""The days get longer, and the nights get longer, and it's about what it's like to grow up in this situation. It's sort of quietly epic, about what becomes important when you don't know what tomorrow holds."" 7. ""Yes, Chef: A Memoir"" by Marcus Samuelsson . Celebrated chef Marcus Samuelsson is recounting his rise in the culinary world in this memoir arriving June 26, but that story necessitates that he intertwines his personal path as well. Born in Ethiopia and raised in Sweden by an adoptive family, Samuelsson retraces his growth from a boy helping his Swedish grandmother in the kitchen to becoming an acclaimed chef with one of the hottest restaurants in NYC. (That would be Harlem's Red Rooster, if you want to make reservations.) 8. ""Gold: A Novel"" by Chris Cleave . Chris Cleave's novel ""Little Bee"" was inescapable in 2009, and we're betting that this summer's ""Gold"" will be the same -- and not just because it's tied to the Olympics. Cleave's latest follows two women who are not only friends but rivals, as they've trained as cyclists together since they were 19. Now 32, one woman balances her desire to win the gold at the 2012 Olympics in London with her daughter's battle against cancer as her friend and training partner weighs how important the gold medal is over their friendship. ""'Gold' is great in a few ways,"" Publishers Weekly's Harvkey said of the July 3 release. ""One, it's an incredibly breezy read, and it builds to this breathless conclusion. The racing scenes, which could be dull, are amazingly rendered. And then the three characters are really well developed. It's a fast-paced read."" 9. ""Shadow of Night"" by Deborah Harkness . Part of Deborah Harkness' All Souls trilogy, ""Shadow of Night"" is the follow-up to her 2011 best-seller ""A Discovery of Witches."" With the aid of vampire and geneticist Matthew Clairmont, Diana Bishop searches for answers about a powerful manuscript. They pick up in the second book, ""Shadow of Night,"" having time traveled to Elizabethan London, where Matthew's history will be explored (he's 1,500 years old, of course) as well. ""In a lot of ways, ('Shadow of Night') is the perfect summer read,"" Schluep said. ""There's fantasy, there's love, (and) there's discovering your calling in life."" ""Shadow of Night"" arrives July 10. 10. ""Albert of Adelaide"" by Howard Anderson . This praised debut from 66-year-old Howard Anderson follows a duck-billed platypus named -- you guessed it -- Albert as he escapes from a zoo in Adelaide, Australia. Albert's missions is to find out whether ""there's any truth to the 'Old Australia' his fellow inmates keep whispering about,"" explains Parnassus Books' Hickey. He also clarifies that this novel, arriving July 10, is for adults. Harvkey is also looking forward to this debut, adding that ""it's dark in some ways ... and (Albert's) not necessarily a cuddly character. It has action, unlikely heroes, and it's also incredibly unusual.""","This summer's reading picks highlight 10 books to watch for .

"(CNN) -- More than 90 people in 30 states were arrested Thursday as federal agents cracked down on the designer synthetic drug industry, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration announced. Almost 5 million packets of fake pot and nearly 167,000 packages of ""bath salts"" were seized as well as $36 million, DEA Administrator Michele M. Leonhart said. Earlier this month President Obama signed a law banning the sale of 31 compounds used in synthetic drugs, but the synthetic drug makers try to skirt the legislation and previous laws by changing the chemical composition. The DEA said it used the authority provided by the Controlled Substance Analogue Enforcement Act. which it said ""specifically exists to combat these new and emerging designer drugs."" Previously on CNN.com: Zombie-like attacker used pot, not 'bath salts' ""Although tremendous progress has been made in legislating and scheduling these dangerous substances, this enforcement action has disrupted the entire illegal industry, from manufacturers to retailers,"" Leonhart said. Members of the DEA, FBI, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and FDA took part in what was dubbed ""Operation Log Jam."" ""Today, we struck a huge blow to the synthetic drug industry,""James Chaparro, the acting director of ICE's Office of Homeland Security Investigations, said. ""The criminal organizations behind the importation, distribution and selling of these synthetic drugs have scant regard for human life in their reckless pursuit of illicit profits."" Leonhart said agents also seized the material to make more than 13.5 million packets of synthetic cannabinoids and 392,000 packets of bath salts. Not the same substance used to scent your bathwater, bath salts contain amphetamine-like chemicals such as methylenedioxypyrovalerone and are sold as ""cocaine substitutes"" or ""synthetic LSD."" Its effects include paranoia, hallucinations, convulsions and psychotic episodes. One former addict told CNN in June that he overdosed on bath salts once and ""I just felt all kinds of crazy."" Freddy Sharp, now 27, said, ""It felt so evil. It felt like the darkest, evilest thing imaginable."" According to the DEA, the number of calls to poison centers related to synthetic drugs soared from about 3,200 in 2010 to more than 13,000 last year. More from CNN Justice.com: .

"(CNN) -- Mohamed Morsi is an American-educated engineer who vowed to stand for democracy, women's rights and peaceful relations with Israel if he won the Egyptian presidency. He is also an Islamist figure who has argued for barring women from the Egyptian presidency and called Israeli leaders ""vampires"" and ""killers."" One analyst describes him as an ""icon"" of those seeking an ""extreme agenda."" On Monday, the Muslim Brotherhood announced that Morsi, 60, had defeated his rival Ahmed Shafik, who briefly served as prime minister in the waning days of Mubarak's regime, in the weekend run-off election. The official vote count was scheduled to be finished at some point Monday, with final results to be announced Thursday . As during the run-up to the first-round vote in May, questions surround how much of a hard line Morsi would take, and in what direction he would steer the country. Morsi leads the Freedom and Justice Party, the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood -- which had been the most powerful political movement in the new Egyptian government. The group controlled about half of the seats in parliament before Egypt's highest court dissolved the legislative body Thursday. His party notes that he was arrested several times under President Hosni Mubarak's regime for protesting ""repressive measures and oppressive practices,"" as well as ""rigged elections."" At one point, he spent seven months in jail. Analysts say Morsi is focusing his campaign on appealing to the broadest possible audience. But he ""represents the older, more conservative wing of the Brotherhood and openly endorses a strict Islamic vision,"" Isobel Coleman of the Council on Foreign Relations wrote in a column for CNN.com. ""A vote for Mohamed Morsi will consolidate the Brotherhood's political influence, which could translate into a constitution with weaker provisions for protection of minority and women's rights."" A slogan associated with his campaign, ""Islam is the solution,"" is sparking concerns that Morsi could introduce a fundamentalist Islamic theocracy. He told CNN last month that he had no such plans. His party seeks ""an executive branch that represents the people's true will and implements their public interests,"" Morsi told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. Photos: Political turmoil in Egypt . ""There is no such thing called an Islamic democracy. There is democracy only. ... The people are the source of authority,"" he said. Asked about the role of women, he vowed that ""women's rights are equal to men."" And asked whether he would maintain Egypt's 1979 accord with Israel, Morsi answered, ""Yes, of course I will. I will respect it provided the other side keep it up and respect it."" Morsi was not originally his party's pick for the country's top post. He was called on to step in after the first choice was disqualified. Khairat al-Shater was among three candidates who were told they did not meet candidacy requirements. The Muslim Brotherhood had originally pledged not to seek the presidency, noted the Financial Times. ""It went back on its word, suspecting that its gains since the January 2011 revolution could be undermined by the military council that has ruled since the fall of President Hosni Mubarak."" Morsi has served as a central behind-the-scenes player for much of the past decade, Eric Trager of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy wrote in a column for The New Republic. He was the Brotherhood's primary point man for state security -- ""the repressive domestic security apparatus through which the Mubarak regime monitored and infiltrated opposition groups,"" Trager writes. ""Indeed, Brotherhood leaders trusted Morsi because they viewed him as ideologically rigid, and therefore unlikely to concede too much to the regime during negotiations."" Morsi was also ""an icon of the extremists in the Muslim Brotherhood,"" pushing for an ""extreme agenda,"" Trager wrote. Morsi's official biography on the Freedom and Justice Party website describes him as ""one of the most prominent political leadership figures of the Brotherhood, the organization that led the struggle against the ousted repressive regime in its last decade."" He led the Brotherhood's parliamentary bloc from 2000 to 2005 in addition to serving as president of the Department of Materials Science, Faculty of Engineering at Zagazig University. Morsi was arrested several times ""due to his constantly firm stance against the repressive measures and oppressive practices of the overthrown regime,"" the party said. ""After the 2005 elections were rigged, Dr. Mohamed Morsi led demonstrations in support for judges demanding independence, refusing referral of some judges to the Competence Commission to punish them for their outspoken views against blatant elections fraud."" The following May, he was among 500 members of the Brotherhood arrested, the party said. Morsi spent seven months behind bars. ""He was arrested, yet again, on the morning of the 'Friday of Anger' on January 28, 2011, during the revolution of January 25 along with a large number of Brotherhood leaders across Egypt. ... When several prisons were destroyed during the revolution, and many prisoners escaped, Dr. Morsi refused to leave his prison cell. Instead, he contacted satellite TV channels and news agencies demanding the judicial authorities visit the prison and check the legal position of jailed Muslim Brotherhood leaders, to clarify if there were indeed any legal reasons for their arrest,"" the party website says. Morsi -- who has bachelor's and master's degrees from Cairo University and a doctorate from the University of Southern California -- insists that under his leadership, such abuses won't happen. There will be ""no need for worry at all over any kind of abusive power,"" he told CNN. ""It will be impossible to allow these kinds of abuse in the shadow of a constitutional state, a lawful state, a state that protects the dignity of a person."" Analysts: 'Soft coup' court riling could reignite Egyptian revolution .","Mohamed Morsi promises a democracy with the people as the source of authority .
He previously argued for barring women from presidency and called Israeli leaders ""vampires""

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama said Monday that U.S. advisers will keep trying to help Uganda and its neighbors capture Joseph Kony, the leader of the Lord's Resistance Army. ""Today, I can announce that our advisers will continue their efforts to bring this madman to justice and to save lives,"" Obama said in a speech at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. ""It's part of our regional strategy to end the scourge that is the LRA and help realize a future where no African child is stolen from their family, and no girl is raped, and no boy is turned into a child soldier."" Kony, who was named a ""specially designated global terrorist"" by President George W. Bush in 2008, gained worldwide notoriety this year after a 30-minute video called ""Invisible Children"" went viral on the Internet. When Obama ordered the effort last year, he had said the National Security Council would review any progress after 150 days. In October, Obama administration officials told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the deployment to Africa of approximately 100 advisers -- most of them U.S. Special Forces -- would be ""short-term."" The U.S. troops have been serving in a mostly advisory role to forces from Uganda, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic in dismantling the Lord's Resistance Army and hunting Kony. For two decades, the group has terrorized central Africa through the abduction of children to serve as soldiers in a campaign of rape, pillage and murder. While the mission does not call for the U.S. troops to engage in combat, they are carrying weapons to be used in self-defense. The Lord's Resistance Army, formed in the late 1980s, is a sectarian military and religious group that operates in northern Uganda and South Sudan. It has committed numerous abuses and atrocities such as abducting, raping, maiming and killing civilians, including women and children, according to globalsecurity.org. Its members are known for hacking off the lips and ears of their victims, looting villages and burning huts, and stealing clothes and medicine from the communities they terrorize. The group has sought to overthrow the Ugandan government and has contributed to instability across the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Sudan. Kony is often ""underrated"" as a leader, according to a 2011 Jane's report on the group. Kony has claimed to be possessed by spirits who dictate the group's strategy. Jane's notes that the tactic has served him well, enabling him to speak to followers who have mixed beliefs. By his portrayal as a medium with supernatural abilities, his authority becomes harder to question within the ranks. The Lord's Resistance Army is sophisticated and less like the ragtag group of fighters it is sometimes portrayed as, Jane's says. It has benefited from the military experience of former Ugandan military officers and years of combat in Sudan. International aid convoys and nongovernmental organizations operating in the region have been threatened by the group, according to numerous reports. Last year, the State Department said that, ""since 2008 alone, the LRA has killed more than 2,400 people and abducted more than 3,400. The United Nations estimates that over 380,000 people are displaced across the region because of LRA activity."" Kony says he is a prophet sent from God to replace the Ugandan government with a democracy based on the Ten Commandments.","Advisers working ""to bring this madman to justice,"" Obama says .

"Washington (CNN) -- William Henderson Foote was a lawman of the highest order in his small town of Yazoo City, Mississippi, when he died in the line of duty more than a century ago. He'd once been the town's constable, town marshal and circuit clerk while serving in the Mississippi legislature. And on Monday, Foote was remembered and recognized as the first African-American federal office killed in the line of duty. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) posthumously awarded its Gold Star Medal to Foote, who served as a post-Reconstruction-era deputy collector with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Internal Revenue -- a predecessor agency to today's ATF. Foote was honored 128 years after his death as part of National Police Week. Several of Foote's descendants were in attendance and Foote's great-grandniece, Bettye Gardner, a professor of African-American history at Coppin State University in Baltimore, Maryland, accepted the award. In December 1883, on what would be his last Christmas Eve, Foote intervened to protect an African-American man from being lynched. In the scuffle, three white men in the lynching party were shot and killed, but Foote ended up being put in prison. Four days later, Foote was killed by a lynch mob that stormed the prison where he was held. He died December 29, 1883. ""They wanted him out of that job, that was a white man's job,"" said Gardner. Foote's name is the latest to be added to ATF's Memorial Wall. As a part of a larger effort to honor all fallen agents of law enforcement, ATF has gone back through historic annals to excavate overlooked stories of heroism like Foote's. ""It was very important once I saw that he had slipped through the cracks of history that we make sure that we bring him and his story to life here at ATF,"" said ATF historian Barbara Osteika, who discovered William Foote's story in a New York Times article from decades ago. On the wall beside Foote's name is the name of William L. Pappan, an agent of the then, U.S. Department of Treasury, Bureau of Internal Revenue, Alcohol Tax Unit, who died in 1935 as the first Native American federal investigator killed in the line of duty. ""It was too long, but the fact is we're not perfect in getting all of the names up on the wall. But, it's my passion to make sure each and every agent that served to protect our communities against violent crime -- each and every one of them that has lost their life in the line of duty -- will get on our wall,"" said Osteika. Foote was born a free man in 1843. And the period following the Civil War was a complicated one, explained the keynote speaker of Monday's event, Sharon Malone, wife of U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. ""The shocking thing to me, actually being a Southerner, (was) finding out that there were free black people in the state of Mississippi at the turn of the 19th century, not the 20th,"" said Malone who hails from Alabama and is her family's historian. She added, ""We tend to know only one narrative of life in the South, and that is of slave and slave owners. But there is a very rich and varied history that we have yet to tap in to."" While Foote's story of sacrifice has recently gained public attention, his has been a story of family lore for generations of his ancestors. ""It's just been a wonderful legacy come to life,"" said Patricia Nolcox, who is Foote's great-granddaughter. ""And, the interesting and important thing is that it wasn't new to them (the family), they knew the story also. We had pictures, we talked about it. But, it was just our story, the family story,"" she said, as she stood beside her cousin, Gardner. The process of documenting Foote's story brought both a new perspective to the African-American experience during the period of Reconstruction, and also brought an extended family together. ""I hadn't seen her since she was a toddler,"" Nolcox said of Gardner as they stood side by side in ATF's atrium. ""I'm the oldest descendant and I'm proud of it,"" she added. ""The real legacy is to understand that black people, people of color have been involved and have been patriots in this country from its very inception,"" said Malone.","The ATF honors William Henderson Foote, who was killed 128 years ago .

"(CNN) -- Bradley Wiggins made history on the Champs Elysees Sunday as he became the first British rider to win cycling's Tour de France. And in a double triumph for Britain, his Team Sky teammate Mark Cavendish claimed the 20th and final stage in Paris for the fourth successive year. Proudly wearing the race leader's yellow jersey, Wiggins finished safely in the bunch, pumping the air in triumph as he crossed the line after three weeks and 3,497km of racing. The 32-year-old Londoner finished three minutes 21 seconds clear of Chris Froome to complete a one-two for Britain and Team Sky. Italy's Vincenzo Nibali (Liquigas) claimed the final podium position. Blue Sky thinking delivers historic yellow . Wiggins was assured of overall victory after his brilliant victory in the individual time trial Saturday, his second on this year's race. ""It's very surreal at the moment. This sort of thing happens to other people, you never imagine it happens to you,"" he told ITV Sport after his triumph. ""It's incredible. I bet I'll look back in years to come and think 'God, that was special'."" Wiggins was quickly congratulated by British Prime Minister David Cameron, who said his victory was an ""immense feat of physical and mental ability"". ""Bradley Wiggins has scaled one of the great heights of British sporting achievement, to be the first person in 109 years to win the Tour de France. ""I think the whole country wants to say well done, brilliant -- the perfect backdrop and start to the Olympics,"" he told Sky News. The final stage over 120km from Rambouillet to Paris was largely processional until hitting the finishing circuit in the French capital where the action started. Wiggins had vowed to deliver victory to world champion Mark Cavendish and in the final kilometer he came to the front of the bunch to set the pace. Cavendish then took it up in his trademark style to hold off green points jersey winner Peter Sagan of Slovakia and Australia's Matthew Goss. It was his third stage win of this year's Tour de France and sixth for Team Sky. Wiggins and Cavendish will now turn their attentions to the London Olympics, which start later this week. Cavendish is favorite for the men's road race next Saturday, where he will again look for Wiggins for support. Wiggins is targeting the individual time trial later in the Games for his tilt at a fourth Olympic gold medal. In anticipation of a triumph for Wiggins, thousands of jubilant British fans watched the action unfold on the Champs Elysees, waving Union Jack flags as he stood on the podium to receive the yellow jersey for the final time. Wiggins had been in the most famous outfit in cycling for 13 days after seizing control of the race at the end of the first week. With superb support from his teammates, and in particular Kenyan-born Froome, he tightened his grip on the overall classification as defending champion Cadel Evans of Australia fell by the wayside. Nibali offered the strongest challenge to the British duo, but he eventually finished over six minutes adrift of Wiggins. Thomas Voeckler gave the home nation some cheer by claiming the polka dot King of the Mountains jersey while Tejay Van Garderen of the United States finished fifth overall, two places ahead of BMC teammate Evans, to win the white jersey for best rider under 25.","Team Sky's Bradley Wiggins wins Tour de France .

"(CNN) -- Brandt Snedeker leads the British Open after Friday's eventful second round. The American matched Adam Scott's incredible opening round of 64 to claim a one stroke lead over the Australian. Tiger Woods was a further three strokes behind on six under par. The 14 time major winner holed a tremendous chip shot out of the bunker at the 18th to end his round with a birdie. Snedeker's impressive five under par opening round was overshadowed by Scott's record breaking first day. However, the Nashville native leapfrogged his rival who posted a 67 stroke round. Following his near faultless second round, Snedeker is now the only player in the competition who has not dropped a shot. Snedeker also matched Nick Faldo's long standing halfway record score of 130 - which has been unmatched since 1992. ""I'm in shock right now,"" the world number 29 told the British Open website. ""I feel pretty good not to have dropped a shot so far this week and am proud to tie the championship 36-hole record. ""All I'm trying to do is to hit the middle of the greens and not get in any trouble."" Woods, who has failed to add to his 14 majors since winning the 2008 U.S. Open, dropped a stroke with a bogey at the 11th, but stayed in contention with four birdies. His sumptuous chip on the final hole had the crowd cheering, but Woods claimed the shot ""wasn't as hard as it may have looked."" ""Overall I'm very pleased at where I'm at - I'm right there in the mix,"" the three time British Open winner said. ""I figured I had a game plan that I thought would fit well on this golf course and I figured I could execute it. ""It's just patience on a golf course like this. I'm hitting the ball in the fairway. You can take your chances, but you'd better pull it off or be conservative and play to different spots."" Dane Thorbjorn Olesen was one shot behind Woods, with 2010 U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell and Americans Jason Dufner and Matt Kuchner one shot behind on four under par. Why U.S golf has a healthy future . Current world number one Luke Donald rescued his championship with a roller coaster round that ended with the Englishman two under par. Donald opened with a bogey at the third, but regained his form with four birdies that put the current European golfer of the year back in contention. A further two bogeys at the start of the back nine looked to have ended the comeback but a birdie at the 15th meant Donald finished tied for 11th. ""I'm certainly feeling more comfortable,"" Donald said at the end of his faltering round. ""Obviously, where I am in my career I need to be contending,"" said Donald, whose best finish at a major is third. World number two Rory McIlroy struggled to find his game as he struggled to a 75, leaving him two over par and little to play for with the final two rounds. A double on the ninth looked to be the turning point for the Northern Irishman, who admitted ""it wasn't the best day out there."" ""I was doing pretty well just to hang on in there around par on the front nine. Making a double on the ninth was sort of the turning point in the round and I couldn't really recover from that,"" said the 2011 U.S. Open champion. There will be some notable absentees from the weekend's action, with reigning British Open champion Darren Clarke one of those heading home. American Phil Mickelson, a four time major winner, former world number one Martin Kaymer and three time Ryder Cup winner Sergio Garcia also missed the cut. Northern Irishman Clarke admitted he was ""disappointed"" with his defense of the title won at Royal St. George last year. ""I would have liked to have come here and put up a good score in defense,"" said Clarke. American Mickelson, who has spent over 700 weeks ranked inside golf's top ten, struck three double bogeys and three bogeys as he carded a round of 78. ""I hit it solid but I didn't hit it straight, and I found a lot of bunkers off the tee,"" Mickelson complained. ""I thought I was going to have a little bit of a better round than I did."" Play continues on Saturday, with the concluding round on Sunday.","American Snedeker equals 20 year old half way record .

"(CNN) -- A nurse accused of killing a Texas mother in a parking lot and stealing her 3-day-old son had suffered a miscarriage and believed she needed to show her fiance that she had a child, authorities said Wednesday. A judge refused to allow bond for Verna McClain, 30, a mother of three children. McClain told her fiance ""she was pregnant and had given birth to a child, by him,"" said Montgomery County Sheriff's Capt. Bruce Zenor. ""She represented this (the abducted baby) as her child."" Witnesses said Kala Golden, 28, who was shot outside a Houston-area pediatrician's office Tuesday, screamed and attempted to chase after the car with her son inside, CNN affiliate KTRK reported. The car struck Golden as it left the scene, the station said. She died later at a hospital. Authorities said she had several gunshot wounds to the torso. McClain is accused of killing Golden and taking 3-day-old Keegan Schuchardt. She was arrested just before midnight Tuesday, according to an arrest report. She is charged with capital murder, Montgomery County District Attorney Brett Ligon told reporters. Zenor indicated the attack on Golden was random. A handgun has been recovered, officials said. Police believe the kidnapping was the motive for the shooting, the report said. The baby was found safe about six hours later at the residence of the suspect's sister, authorities said. They said they believe McClain acted alone. ""It was a very emotional event for everybody who was there,"" Ligon said of the recovery of the infant. Keegan was initially taken into the custody of Texas Child Protective Services, CNN affiliate KHOU reported. Golden's husband, Keith Schuchardt, told KHOU he had not yet signed Keegan's birth certificate, which complicated the process of getting his son back. The baby was returned to him Wednesday after the paperwork was resolved, according to Warren Diepraam, Montgomery County district attorney trial division chief. Schuchardt told the station he was at work when he got a call regarding the shooting. His wife was dead when he reached the hospital, he said. ""It's just a random thing, I think,"" he said. ""We don't have any enemies. I don't know why anyone would do it. Maybe she lost her baby and wanted a baby ... or to sell him. I want to get my baby back."" According to the arrest report, Golden, carrying Keegan, was leaving the Northwoods Pediatric Center in the Houston suburb of Spring when the incident took place Tuesday afternoon. ""The defendant confronted Mrs. Golden and shot her multiple times in the parking lot,"" then took the baby and left, the report said. McClain's vehicle was found at an apartment complex, according to the report. The Montgomery County Sheriff's Office said detectives began a ""systematic canvas and search"" of areas near the shooting scene and spied the car at the apartment complex. The detectives questioned residents and examined the vehicle, alerting investigators of their findings. A SWAT team entered an apartment in the complex to search for the baby, the statement said. McClain returned to the apartment as the investigation was continuing and asked to speak to police, the report said. ""She admitted to shooting Mrs. Golden and taking her baby,"" the arrest report said. During an interview with authorities, McClain provided information that only someone at the scene would know, the report said. Evidence was found at both residences and in the car ""that support the arrest of the suspect,"" the sheriff's office said. McClain's sister, Corina Jackson, told police her sister had said she would be adopting a child soon. ""After killing Golden and kidnapping Keegan, defendant stated to Corina that she now had the child and would be needing to do the adoption, indicating that the abduction of the child was her motive for killing Golden,"" the report said. McClain's oldest child is about 16 and the youngest is 6, Diepraam told CNN. Authorities said Tuesday that Golden and the woman parked next to her at the doctor's office apparently spoke to one another or argued before the shooting. ""They were talking,"" witness Tia Collins told KTRK. ""I did see the lady get out, and they were struggling."" She said she heard gunshots and saw Golden fall. The shooting shocked Houston-area residents. Spring is about 20 miles north of the city. Jennifer Hartis, a friend of the victim, was one of the many left wondering why. ""She never did anything wrong. She's just a mom doing her best to take care of her kids, and I miss her,"" Hartis told CNN affiliate KPRC. ""Keegan is only 3 days old. He needs to know his mom, and she can't do that now. "" ""I'm thinking this is crazy,"" Frank Johnson of Houston told KHOU. ""I'm thinking this doesn't really happen every day in the city. I mean, you hear about a lot of shootings and other types of crimes, but somebody kidnaps a baby, 3 days old, and the mother to be shot? I mean, that's serious stuff. That's really scary."" CNN's Carma Hassan and Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","The suspect had a miscarriage and wanted a baby to show fiance, authorities say .

"(CNN) -- Jury selection in the trial of Jerry Sandusky, the former Penn State assistant football coach charged with child rape, is scheduled to start Tuesday in Pennsylvania. A judge last week denied his attorneys' latest bid for a delay, allowing the case to move forward. Sandusky, 68, has been under house arrest since being charged with sexually abusing 10 boys over 14 years. Prosecutors allege he met some of his accusers through Second Mile, a charity he created for underprivileged children. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. According to a source close to the Sandusky family, he is expected to attend court Tuesday. The allegations against Sandusky led to the firing of iconic Penn State head football coach Joe Paterno only months before he died of complications from lung cancer. Several of the people whom prosecutors accuse Sandusky of abusing asked a judge to protect their identities at trial. However, Judge John Cleland on Monday ruled the alleged victims' identities may not be concealed during the trial, although they will be protected through the jury selection process. ""Courts are not customarily in the business of withholding information,"" Cleland's ruling said. ""Secrecy is thought to be inconsistent with the openness required to assure the public that the law is being administered fairly and applied faithfully."" Prosecutors in Sandusky case present new, graphic details . But, the judge noted, ""It is also to be hoped that various news organizations that will report on the trial will use what has become their professional custom to protect the privacy of alleged victims."" CNN generally does not identify alleged victims of sexual assault. Victim advocacy groups slammed the judge's decision late Monday, expressing their hope it would not have a chilling effect on the reporting of child sexual abuse. ""The judge placed a significant burden on this class of victims by stating that they have 'a duty to the community to testify' about the crime, but denying them privacy protections in exchange for that testimony. By bravely coming forward, victims serve in the interest of public safety; they should be assured that their privacy will be protected,"" the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape, the National Center for Victims of Crime and the National Crime Victim Law Institute said in a joint statement. Those asking for their identities to be concealed included one man known simply as Victim 4. His attorney, Ben Andreozzi, said he believes his client, now 28, is the strongest witness for the prosecution and will be called to testify first. ""In society, sometimes we question why rape victims are reluctant to come forward,"" Andreozzi said Monday after the ruling. ""So now we have our answer. ... We are disappointed."" ""We are not asking to close the courtroom, only to use a pseudonym,"" he said. His client will still testify, he said, ""but at what expense to his emotional well-being?"" He said he expects the defense to attack his client on the basis of a meeting he had with Sandusky in the years after the alleged abuse. ""My client couldn't break free,"" said the attorney, describing the relationship between Victim 4 and Sandusky as ""complex."" Mike McQueary, a former graduate student considered to be another key witness in the Sandusky case, has testified that he alerted Paterno in 2002 that he'd seen what appeared to be Sandusky sexually assaulting a boy, an allegation authorities didn't learn of until years later. Psychologist flagged Sandusky as 'likely pedophile' in 1998 report . But prosecutors said later that the incident took place about a year earlier than what was originally alleged, causing defense attorneys for two former Penn State officials to argue that one of the charges should now be dropped. Tim Curley, Penn State's former athletic director, and Gary Schultz, a former university vice president who oversaw campus police, have been charged with perjury and failing to report the alleged sexual assault of a child. Both of them have pleaded not guilty, and their attorneys have said that prosecutors ""charged this case before (they) knew the facts."" After news of the scandal broke last year, The New York Times published an extensive interview in which Sandusky attempted to clarify his relationships with young people. ""If I say, 'No, I'm not attracted to young boys,' that's not the truth,"" he said, according to the story. ""Because I'm attracted to young people -- boys, girls -- I ..."" His lawyer, who was present at the interview, spoke up at that point to note that Sandusky is ""not sexually"" attracted to them. ""Right. I enjoy -- that's what I was trying to say -- I enjoy spending time with young people. I enjoy spending time with people,"" Sandusky continued. ""I mean, my two favorite groups are the elderly and the young."" CNN's Susan Candiotti, Ross Levitt and Jason Carroll contributed to this report.","Jury selection is scheduled to get under way Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- The man suspected of killing three people and wounding others near Auburn University turned himself in to authorities late Tuesday, authorities said. Desmonte Leonard, 22, turned himself in to U.S. marshals at the federal courthouse in Montgomery, said Montgomery County Sheriff D.T. Marshall. It was not immediately clear when Leonard would be transported to Auburn. Auburn Police Chief Tommy Dawson said Leonard faces three counts of capital murder and two counts of assault. He will be processed into the Montgomery County Jail and ""held there for a while,"" he told reporters. ""You can't run but for so long,"" the police chief said. ""We were going to pursue until we caught him."" Dawson also addressed the families of the victims. ""I know your young men won't be coming home, but hopefully this arrest will give you some closure. It's not over. We're going to continue to investigate this case,"" he said. The development came hours after a small army of law enforcement officers swarmed a Montgomery home where Leonard was believed to be hiding and came up empty-handed. Police surrounded and searched the house for more than six hours, spraying ""a powerful dose"" of tear gas in hopes of flushing out the man. They scaled down their efforts at the house Tuesday after they could not find Leonard. The officers from local, state and federal agencies looked frustrated, CNN affiliate WFSA reported. Police defended the raid at a news conference early Tuesday after reports surfaced that they had gone to the wrong house and used excessive force. Montgomery Police Chief Kevin Murphy said he had every reason to believe Leonard had once been in the attic. Police called on him to come out. They did not get a response, although they heard coughing and detected movement in the attic. By the time they launched a raid on the house, the suspect was gone. ""We didn't go into that house foot by foot. We took it inch by inch,"" Murphy said. ""We didn't want anybody else to get hurt. We did everything right."" Police received three calls about Leonard being in the area; the third was from a woman who owned the house. She said she returned from work to find a man who looked like the suspect sitting on her couch, said Montgomery Mayor Tommy Strange. She then ran out to her car and called police, he said. Saturday night's shootings took place at an off-campus apartment complex in Auburn, about 50 miles east of Montgomery. The dead included two former Auburn football players. A current football player was among the wounded. ""This has been an incredibly difficult 72 hours,"" Gene Chizik, Auburn's head football coach, told reporters Tuesday. ""The whole Auburn family is devastated."" ""We've got a road ahead of us right now, and it's a long road of grieving,"" he said. Police had posted a $30,000 reward for information on Leonard's whereabouts. Two other men have been jailed on charges of hindering prosecution in the case. Auburn police said one of those arrested, Jeremy Thomas, 18, left the scene of the shootings with Leonard. Montgomery police say Gabriel Thomas, 41, tried to mislead investigators during the search, and they arrested him Sunday at the request of U.S. Marshals. Police did not immediately disclose the relationship, if any, between the two men. Both were arrested in Montgomery, but Jeremy Thomas was expected to be transferred to a jail in Lee County, which includes Auburn, police said. Officers received a call reporting the shooting at the University Heights apartments clubhouse about 10:03 p.m. Saturday, Auburn Police Chief Dawson said Sunday. Arriving officers found Edward Christian, 20, dead at the scene. Christian, of Valdosta, Georgia, was off the football team because of an injury, Dawson said. Former player Ladarious Phillips, 20, and Auburn resident Demario Pitts, 20, died later at a hospital, he said. Two others, including current Auburn sophomore offensive lineman Eric Mack, 20, of Cameron, South Carolina, were taken to East Alabama Medical Center in the nearby town of Opelika. Mack was released from the medical center Sunday morning, while another man, Xavier Moss, 19, was treated and released from the same facility. A third man, John Robertson, 20, was transferred to the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital, where he was in critical condition after being shot in the head. Leonard and two other men were thought to have fled the scene in a white Chevrolet Caprice, authorities said. Police later found the car abandoned in an adjacent county, Dawson said. Police have a motive in the shooting, but Dawson would not release it, saying ""that's for the courtroom, later on."" He did say authorities believe gunfire erupted during a fight at a party.

"Washington (CNN) -- A U.S. Marine allegedly stabbed another Marine to death after a bar fight early Saturday morning across the street from the Marine Barracks in the nation's capital, police said. The accused attacker has been arrested. ""Information uncovered during the course of the preliminary investigation indicates that there was a verbal exchange, and during the exchange a homophobic slur was heard from the suspect prior to the stabbing,"" Washington's Metropolitan Police Department said in a statement. The fight began in a bar and spilled into the street, according to Capt. Jack Morton, a spokesman for the Marine Barracks. Two Marine guards on duty outside the Marine Barracks saw the fight and moved in to break it up. They subdued the alleged attacker and helped police take him into custody, Morton said. D.C. police identified the stabbing victim as 23-year-old Philip Bushong. He was transported to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Michael Joseph Poth, 23, was named as the suspect. Police did not release other details. A Marine official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the victim was based at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, and that the alleged attacker is stationed at the Marine Barracks. The Marine Barracks, located in southeast Washington D.C., is the residence of Marines stationed there who serve as guards at the White House and other locations.

"(CNN) -- Eight of the 13 people facing hazing charges after the death of a Florida A&M University band member had turned themselves in by Thursday afternoon, a state police spokeswoman said. All eight who have surrendered so far face felony charges in the November death of 26-year-old Robert Champion, said Gretl Plessinger, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Of the remaining three who face the same count, two are in Georgia and one is in Delaware, she said. ""We're in contact with their attorneys or their families, and are expecting them to turn themselves in,"" Plessinger said. Champion, a FAMU Marching 100 drum major, collapsed on a band bus after a November 2011 football game in Orlando. Medical examiners reported his death came within an hour of his being badly beaten during a hazing incident. Prosecutors announced charges in Champion's death Wednesday. Eleven of the 13 people are charged with hazing resulting in death, a felony, while two others face a misdemeanor hazing count. Champion's mother has said her family is disappointed that the suspects didn't face more serious charges, and she told reporters Thursday that authorities botched the investigation into her son's death. Pam Champion said authorities didn't properly process the bus for evidence and failed to immediately question students who were on the bus. And the family's lawyer, Chris Chestnut, said the family believes FAMU alumni coached the students on how to answer questions from police. ""We know they were caucusing to determine how to get away with murder,"" Chestnut said. He said the family plans to sue the school soon. Deputy Ginette Rodriguez, a spokeswoman for the Orange County Sheriff's Office, defended its investigation. ""I know our deputies questioned everyone available,"" Rodriguez said. ""I can assure you our detectives conducted a thorough and complete investigation, as we do in every case."" Champion's death brought renewed public scrutiny to hazing, a practice that has gone on for years despite what the Tallahassee university said had been efforts to eradicate the problem. Champion's mother called for FAMU's famous marching band to be disbanded for the upcoming year, saying the school ""cannot go on with business as usual."" Nine students at University of Florida charged with hazing . ""They need to clean out the filth to move forward. How can they allow the band out there?"" she said Thursday. ""They haven't done anything to safeguard students -- certainly not my son. My son was murdered."" The prosecutor who brought the charges, Orange County State Attorney Lawson Lamar, said Wednesday that the case built by investigators does not support a charge of murder. Some university band members have said Champion died after taking part in an annual rite of passage called ""Crossing Bus C,"" an initiation process in which pledges attempt to run down the center aisle from the front door of the bus to the back while being punched, kicked and otherwise assaulted by senior members. An estimated 30 people were on the vehicle. An autopsy found ""extensive contusions of his chest, arms, shoulder and back,"" as well as ""evidence of crushing of areas of subcutaneous fat,"" medical examiners reported. In a written statement, FAMU General Counsel Avery McKnight said the school ""remains committed to the absolute eradication of hazing from all aspects of the university experience."" ""The university will be able to address all aspects of the marching band after reviewing the documents and evidence flowing from the Champion case and from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's final report on its investigation of the marching band,"" McKnight said. ""As for now, the marching band continues on indefinite suspension."" Those facing the more serious charges could serve up to six years in prison if convicted, Lamar said. The two suspects charged only with misdemeanors could be jailed for up to a year. Of the eight who had surrendered on felony charges by Thursday morning, all but three had been released on $15,000 bail, Plessinger told CNN. Two -- Jessie Baskin, 20, and Benjamin McNamee, 21, turned themselves in in Miami. Two others, Rikki Wills, 24, and Caleb Jackson, 23, surrendered in Tallahassee. Bryan Jones, 23, surrendered Wednesday night in Tampa, while 20-year-old Harold Finley turned himself in at the Palm Beach County jail. Two others, 19-year-old Aaron Golson and 26-year-old Shawn Turner, surrendered in Gadsden County, near Tallahassee. Jackson, Golson and Finley had not yet made bail Thursday afternoon, Plessinger said. Earlier this year, the Champions filed a negligence lawsuit against the bus company and its driver. Fabulous Coach Lines President Ray Land said before the suit was filed that the company's employees, who were not on the bus at the time, responded quickly after learning that there was an emergency, even following the ambulance transporting Champion to the hospital. The school's band director, meanwhile, asked for full reinstatement Wednesday. An attorney for Julian White, who was placed on paid administrative leave shortly after Champion's death, said his client worked to root out hazing over 22 years as director. ""Dr. White remains disappointed that barely 48 hours after meeting with band members, that Robert Champion was killed in an extreme, horrific and illegal act of bullying,"" White's attorney, Chuck Hobbs, said in a statement.","NEW: FAMU says its goal is the ""absolute eradication"" of hazing .

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Voters dealt major blows to Greece's two most established parties in parliamentary elections Sunday, leaving no party with anything approaching a majority and the politically and economically volatile nation even more in flux. With 97% of votes counted early Monday by the Interior Ministry, the right-leaning New Democracy -- part of the present ruling coalition -- finished first with 19% support to capture 109 seats. That figure is barely half the percentage that it won in elections in 2009 and well short of what party leader Antonis Samaras admitted it hoped for entering this weekend. ""I asked for a strong mandate, but people chose differently. I respect their message,"" Samaras said in remarks carried live on state television. ""Today's result expresses people's disappointment towards the implemented dead-end economic policy that tested their limits and didn't include the necessary development policy."" In an apparent backlash against austerity measures, no party came close to a majority, and the two parties that spearhead the current coalition government earned far short of 50% of all 300 parliamentary seats. That means a new coalition government will again have to be formed. Politicians have until May 17 to come up with a new working alliance or, if they cannot, set a date for another round of elections. Samaras acknowledged the results were disappointing to his party, but said that as the first-place finisher and ""only pillar of political stability in Greece,"" New Democracy now has even more responsibility. If a coalition government can be formed, he said its two priorities would be to remain in the eurozone and alter existing policies, including stringent austerity measures, to ""achieve development and offer people relief."" ""I understand people's rage, but I will not let the country (exist) without a government,"" Samaras said. The other party to see its support plummet was left-leaning PASOK, New Democracy's coalition partner. Three years after beating out all other parties with 44% of the vote, PASOK took 13.3% this time -- giving it 41 spots in parliamentary, compared to 160 after the previous election. PASOK's leader, Evangelos Venizelos, said in a speech carried on state TV that he favored the formation of a unity government that is ""EU-oriented, regardless of what their take is on"" previously implemented measures. The tribulations of New Democracy and PASOK were matched by triumphs of a number of other parties that were also-rans and in some cases nonexistent just a few years ago, propelled by voters angry about stringent austerity measures. Elections in Europe: Socialist wins French presidency . The radical leftist coalition Syriza passed PASOK with a strong second-place showing. Exit polls predicted it would garner 10% support, but instead Syriza garnered 16.7% support, according to the all-but-final results. That more than triples its parliamentary representation to 51 seats. ""This is a message of a peaceful revolution,"" said Syriza party leader Alexis Tsipras. ""European leadership and especially (German Chancellor Angela) Merkel have to understand that austerity policies have suffered defeat."" The fourth-place finisher, the Independent Greek party, was founded in February by ousted New Democracy parliamentarian Panos Kammenos. With 10.6% backing, this right-wing nationalist party, which opposes Greece's agreement with the European Union and International Monetary Fund, will now have 33 seats in parliament. The Communist Party, which wants Greece to leave the single-currency eurozone, also saw gains in winning 8.5% support. And the far-right Golden Dawn party, which got 0.3% of votes the previous election, ended up with 7% support on Sunday. That equates to rise from zero to 21 parliamentary seats. Its leader, Nikos Michaloliakos, gave a rousing speech after Sunday's vote saying Golden Dawn would ""fight so that Greece won't be a slave of the memorandum and of the social jungle that illegal immigrants have brought in this country."" ""Everyone who betrays Hellenism should be afraid. We are coming,"" he said. Katerina Sokou, financial editor of the Greek daily newspaper Kathimerini, called what happened Sunday ""a protest vote (against) the main two political parties of Greece."" Yet Sokou added that she expects New Democracy and PASOK again will be part of the ruling coalition government, even though there may be notable policy changes and challenges to come, including a ""renegotiation"" of already approved austerity measures. ""I believe that these electoral results ... show that people need a coalition government,"" she said. ""They also want the parties to cooperate."" One young mother interviewed by CNN said her aim Sunday, before the voters were counted, was to ""punish"" pro-austerity politicians and ""get rid of them for good."" Austerity is ""the wrong path,"" said the woman, who did not give her name. ""Austerity measures just make people poorer and the situation does not get any better in the long term or in the short term either,"" she said. But another voter at the same polling station said politicians have been doing the right thing. ""We don't have an alternative,"" he said, saying he backed ""whichever party actually understands that and wants to deal with it and wants to take these hard measures."" He also did not give his name. The country's national debt threatened to force it to drop Europe's common currency, the euro, prompting the European Central Bank and other lenders to swoop in with emergency funding last year. In exchange, they demanded that the government slash spending brutally. Austerity measures already enacted have led to cuts in jobs, wages, pensions and benefits, and have negatively affected many people, especially pensioners and those who get state assistance. Taxes have gone up and the national unemployment rate for January, the latest month for which figures are available, was just under 22%. Among 25- to 34-year-olds, it was nearly 29%, leading many young people to leave the country in search of work. Furthermore, for the past two years, the country's massive amount of debt has threatened the stability of the 17-country eurozone. Greece pushed through a huge debt swap in March to save it from disorderly default and clear the way for it to receive a second bailout from the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, worth Ã¢âÂ¬130 billion ($171.5 billion). The debt restructuring deal gave some breathing space to the eurozone bloc, where fears that Greece might collapse had increased pressure on other debt-laden nations such as Spain and Italy. But the outcome of Sunday's vote raises fresh questions as to whether Greece will stick with the painful path of austerity. CNN's Antonia Mortensen and Matthew Chance contributed to this report.","No one party comes close to a majority; established parties suffer setbacks .

"(CNN) -- New HIV infections have fallen worldwide by 17 percent over the past eight years, a testament to prevention efforts, according to a U.N. report released Tuesday. In addition, the number of people living with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, has increased, and over the last five years, AIDS deaths have declined by 10 percent, thanks to antiretroviral drug therapy and access to lifesaving treatments, said the report by the Joint U.N. Program on HIV/AIDS and World Health Organization. However, not all the news was good as researchers found evidence that some prevention programs miss the mark because they are not tailored for different populations affected by the epidemic. Success was seen particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where new infections declined about 15 percent, or some 400,000 people, according to the report. However, that area remains the region hardest-hit by the virus, accounting for 67 percent of infections worldwide, the report said. ""The epidemic continues to have an enormous impact on households, communities, businesses, public services and national economies in the region,"" it said. In 2008, for instance, more than 14.1 million children in sub-Saharan Africa were estimated to have lost one or both parents to AIDS. In East Asia, new infections declined by nearly 25 percent, and by 10 percent in South and Southeast Asia, the organizations said. In Eastern Europe, a region that had seen a dramatic increase in new infections among intravenous drug users, ""the epidemic has leveled off considerably,"" the report said. In Eastern Europe and Central Asia, an HIV epidemic that once resulted from injected drug use is spreading to the sexual partners of those drug users, according to the report. And in some parts of Asia, heterosexual couples are being affected. The prevalence of HIV continues to increase in those regions because of the new infections, the report said. And in Swaziland in southern Africa, more than two-thirds of adult infections occur in people 25 and older, but few programs are aimed at those adults, the report said. While the decline in new infections is welcome, ""if we do a better job of getting resources and programs to where they will make most impact, quicker progress can be made and more lives saved,"" said Michael Sidibe, executive director of UNAIDS in Geneva, Switzerland. There is also an increased evidence of risk among key populations, the report said. For instance, although high prevalence among sex workers has been widely noted, evidence was limited on the prevalence among men engaging in homosexual activity and intravenous drug users. ""In recent years, studies have documented elevated levels of infection in these populations in nearly all regions,"" according to the report. ""In all settings and for diverse types of epidemics, it is clear that programs to prevent new infections among these key populations must constitute an important part of national AIDS responses."" Also, the level of resources directed at prevention programs for those key groups is ""typically quite low, even in concentrated epidemics,"" according to the report. Another shortage can be seen in the programs that are designed for people living with HIV.","New infections in sub-Saharan Africa 15 percent lower in 2008, report says .
That area remains the region hardest-hit by HIV .
Decline attributed in part to HIV prevention efforts, UNAIDS official says .

"(CNN) -- A 22-year-old man wanted in the shooting deaths of 9-year-old Alabama twins and their elderly babysitter was arrested Saturday morning, authorities said. Deandra Marquis Lee was captured around 11 a.m. in Selma, the Alabama Bureau of Investigation announced. Prior to his arrest, authorities converged on an apartment complex near the Vaughan Regional Medical Center and evacuated residents from his building. Efforts to ""initiate communication"" with people inside the apartment were unsuccessful, the state investigative bureau said in a news release. Authorities then ""made entry into the apartment (and) immediately took Lee into custody."" He is charged with three counts of murder in the deaths of the twins and their 73-year-old caregiver, Jack Mac Girdner. The bodies of Girdner and the twins, Jordan and Taylor Dejerinett, were found Tuesday afternoon on a dirt road near Hayneville, southwest of Montgomery, state investigators said. The children and Girdner, according to the bureau investigators, were last seen Sunday when the twins' mother left them in the care of the babysitter. When the twins' mother returned later that night to pick them up from the suburban Montgomery home of the babysitter, the children and Girdner were missing, investigators said, along with Girdner's car, a 1988 Mercedes-Benz. Authorities did not release a possible motive in the killings, though they confirmed the three victims were shot. State investigators also did not say what evidence connected Lee to the case. Girdner's car was found -- with its doors removed -- Thursday in Minter, they said. Lee, according to state investigators, has a history of trouble with the law. In 2011, he was acquitted of murder in a 2008 shooting that prosecutors say was gang related. Before Sunday, Lee was out on bond following January 2012 charges in Dallas County that he assaulted a police officer and was in possession of gun with an altered ID number, state investigators said. According to court records, Lee was also arrested on a third-degree robbery charge and released on $10,000 bond in Lowndes County in February 2012 for allegedly stealing a Honda Accord in 2011.","NEW: Authorities evacuated a Selma apartment building before detaining Lee .

"(CNN) -- Chris Pavlak stands behind the coffee bar at a car dealership in Roswell, Georgia, ready to whip up specialty lattes for waiting customers. As a 21-year-old college sophomore, working as a barista at CafÃ© Blends is his first job. ""It's a nice environment and everything, and the other employees are pretty nice too,"" he says. Pinned to his black apron is a blue puzzle piece, a symbol representing autism awareness. It's also a symbol of the cafÃ©'s mission -- ""blending autism into the workplace."" Pavlak and his two co-workers are all young adults on the autism spectrum. The cafÃ© began when Nalley Lexus Roswell general manager Chris Dastou heard about a similar program at a company meeting. ""I decided it was definitely something I was interested in,"" he says. ""Giving them a chance to work and to have an opportunity to grow as a person."" His team partnered with Nobis Works, a nonprofit organization that provides job training and placement for people with barriers to employment, to launch the cafÃ© at the Roswell dealership. Since its opening in December, the response from both employees and customers has been encouraging, Dastou says. Karen Carlisle, vice president of corporate communications and development at Nobis Works, says it is common to hear such positive feedback from employers. ""They say, 'These are the best employees I have because they want to work.' They come in on time. They don't call in sick, and they have such a positive attitude that it's contagious to other employees,"" she says. Mike Pavlak, Chris Pavlak's father, says his son has always had a positive attitude, but expressing it has not always been easy for him. ""His problems have largely been social and social interactions. He still kind of struggles with that. He's shy, especially initially,"" he says. He admits being nervous when his son first took the customer service position but says the improvement he has seen in his son's communication skills since then has been remarkable. ""Within two to three weeks he was back there dancing behind the counters,"" he says. ""I know it's easy to brag because he's my kid, but what he's accomplished is just awesome."" With an emphasis on early detection and treatment, much of autism research and support focuses on children, but CafÃ© Blends is just one of a number of new programs aimed at serving the needs of young adults. ""I think ten years ago it was all about children, but now those children are growing up, and there has been a real recognition that autism is a lifespan disorder,"" says Alison Singer, president of the Autism Science Foundation. Whatever a person's age or abilities, Singer says autism should never be viewed as a barrier to self-fulfillment. ""It's just a matter of making opportunities,"" she says. ""We have people with very strong skills who can have very productive careers. Some might not be able to, but that's also OK. We can still find productive ways for them to contribute to society."" For Mike Pavlak, the opportunity his son found at CafÃ© Blends has encouraged him to think more broadly about his future. ""I think my hopes now are the same thing that Chris wants. I'd like to see him finish his degree. I would like to see him continue work. I would like to see him get out, get an apartment, get a home, do something on his own,"" he says. ""It's gone from a hope to an expectation."" Chris Pavlak recognizes that autism is a reality for him, but he refuses to see it as a limitation. ""I know that you can overcome it,"" he says. ""As you can see, I have this job and am mostly doing it like any normal person would. So we can be just like anyone else."" And like anyone else, he sees his first job not as a destination, but as a beginning. ""It's something I wanted to do to make my own way in the world eventually. Just one of those steps to doing that, I suppose.""","Chris Pavlak is one of three young adults on the autism spectrum working at cafe .

"(CNN) -- She's one of Great Britain's brightest medal hopes ahead of the London Olympics but Jessica Ennis isn't relying on home comforts to help land her a maiden Games gold. The heptathlete has had numerous chances to visit the newly-built Olympic Stadium in the east of the English capital and steal a march on her rivals. But the 25-year-old insists she wants her first trip to the arena to come when she takes to the track to make up for the disappointment of missing the 2008 Games in Beijing. ""There's been lots of opportunities to go, I've seen pictures of it and it looks fantastic, but for me I don't want to become overly familiar with it,"" she told CNN World Sport. ""I want to go down to the stadium when it's games time and for me to step into the stadium with a big crowd and it will all be fresh and new and allow that adrenaline to pump through me. ""Hopefully that will get into my performance and help me perform that little bit better."" Ennis broke through at the 2009 World Championships when she claimed gold in Berlin but last year in Daegu, South Korea, she relinquished her title to Russia's Tatyana Chernova. More disappointment followed at March's World Indoor Championships in Istanbul, where she again was pipped to gold, this time in the pentathlon, by Ukrainian Nataliya Dobrynska. But she says both experiences have helped her to understand exactly what will be required to win gold in front of her home fans in August. ""Obviously I was disappointed with Daegu and Istanbul, getting so close to those gold medals but not quite managing to keep hold of them was disappointing,"" she said. ""But I learned a lot from those championships and learned a lot about the areas I need to work on and improve. ""If someone had said to me five years ago that I'd have three gold medals at major championships and two silver medals then I'd have grabbed that with both hands. ""The thing I've got to take from these past couple of championships is that I've performed consistently over the past few years and always been in the medals."" Too young to compete at Athens in 2004, Ennis was on course to make her Olympic debut in China in 2008, until a foot injury forced her to withdraw. Given the impact she has made on UK athletics, and the high-profile she has enjoyed since Berlin, many people forget that this will be her first ever Games. But she says although her battle with Chernova and Dobrynska is bound to be intense, she is determined to approach the Olympics as she would any other event. ""Having the disappointment from Beijing it's obviously going to be a big year for me,"" she said. ""But I've done lots of championships before, I've had the experience there and I've competed against these girls on numerous occasions so I'm just treating it as any other championship.""","Heptathlete Jessica Ennis says she won't visit Olympic Stadium until it is time to compete .

"(CNN) -- A JetBlue pilot has been indicted, accused of interfering with a flight crew just over two weeks after several passengers wrestled him to the floor after he exhibited what authorities described as erratic behavior. Clayton Osbon, 49, was formally charged Wednesday in a federal court in Amarillo, Texas, where the flight he was on landed safely after the incident, according to an indictment filed that day. The court document says that Osbon ""did knowingly and willingly interfere and attempt to interfere with the performance of the duties of a flight crew member and flight attendant."" The indictment further alleges that he ""moved through the aircraft and was disruptive and had to be subdued and forcibly restrained from re-entering the cockpit."" According to an FBI affidavit, a JetBlue copilot became concerned about Osbon's bizarre behavior early in their March 27 flight from New York to Las Vegas. As the Airbus A320 was climbing out of New York's Kennedy International Airport, Osbon talked about his church and needing to ""focus,"" the affidavit says. He then told the co-pilot to take the controls and to work the radio, and began talking about religion, making statements that were incoherent, it says. At one point, Osbon said, ""We're not going to Vegas,"" according to the affidavit. The concerned co-pilot suggested they invite an off-duty JetBlue captain into the cockpit. Instead, Osbon ""abruptly left the cockpit to go to the forward lavatory,"" the affidavit says. The co-pilot used the opportunity to get the off-duty captain into the cockpit and lock the door. When Osbon tried to enter his code into the cockpit door, the co-pilot announced over the public address system an order to restrain Osbon. Several passengers wrestled Osbon to the floor and restrained him. The flight was diverted to Amarillo, after which Osbon was taken into custody. Last week, U.S. District Court Judge Mary Lou Robinson ordered Osbon to be transferred to an unnamed medical facility for federal prisoners so he could undergo a psychiatric evaluation as part of the process to see whether he was sane during the incident and whether he is competent to stand trial. There is reason to believe Osbon ""may presently be suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent"" to understand the case against him and assist in his defense, the U.S. attorney's office said in a Texas court filing last week. As of Wednesday at least, he remained in custody, according to the indictment.","JetBlue pilot Clayton Osbon began behaving erratically on a March 27 flight, authorities say .

"(CNN) -- Ahead of upcoming nuclear talks, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad downplayed the threat Israel poses to Iran, comparing it to an annoying bug. ""Israel is nothing more than a mosquito which cannot see the broad horizon of the Iranian nation,"" he said Saturday in northeastern Iran's Khorassan province, according to the semi-official Fars news agency. Ahmadinejad said ""regional states"" were being duped into buying billions in arms from ""arrogant and imperial powers,"" driven in part by all the talk surrounding a potential war involving Iran and Israel, the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported. Such military purchases, he said, are unnecessary because there is no war on the horizon between those two nations. The Iranian president alluded to ""rulers"" who sold ""their petrol"" for $60 billion worth in arms, though he did not mention by name either the purchasing or selling country. Saudi Arabia is in the midst of a 20-year, $60 billion arms deal with the United States, including nearly $30 billion for F-15 fighter jets announced late last year. Ahmadinejad has long questioned the existence of the Holocaust and, months after taking office in October 2005, he participated in a lengthy protest called ""World Without Zionism"" and has repeatedly derided Israel. ""With the force of God behind it, we shall soon experience a world without the United States and Zionism,"" he said then, according to another IRNA report. On Saturday, while seemingly backing away from the potential for an armed conflict, Ahmadinejad hardly signaled that Iranians should or will embrace Israel. He predicted Israel could fall if regional powers cut ties -- particularly by refusing to sell oil to Israelis. Tensions have ramped up in recent years over Iran's controversial nuclear program. Iran claims it is being developed for peaceful means, while Western powers and Israel say they think Iran is evading international inspections and intent on developing nuclear weapons. This sentiment has led to sweeping sanctions targeting Iran's economy, government and its leaders. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been a particularly harsh, persistent critic of Iran's leadership and nuclear program, with rumors circulating for months that Israel may pre-emptively strike nuclear sites in Iran and possibly set off a regional war. And Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, last Friday ""blasted the U.S. war-mongering rhetoric against Iran,"" including President Barack Obama's assertion that ""all options are on the table."" He added war ""can be 10 times more harmful to"" the United States than Iran, according to a Fars report. Even with all the back-and-forth, there has been an apparent shift recently in the tone, and manner, of dialogue between the two sides. EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton described nuclear talks last month in Istanbul, Turkey, between international and Iranian diplomats on nuclear matters as ""constructive and useful."" And Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi said last week that he was optimistic that there would be progress in continued talks with the United States, Russia, China, Germany, France and Britain -- the so-called P5+1, Fars reported. Those parties are set to meet again May 23 in Baghdad. Before then, discussions in Vienna, Austria, will be held on Monday and Tuesday to address ""outstanding issues and remove ambiguities,"" Iran's envoy to the International Atomic Energy Agency Ali-Asghar Soltanieh said, according to Fars. CNN's Azadeh Ansari contributed to this report.","NEW: Ahmadinejad says ""regional states"" have little need to purchase arms .

"London (CNN) -- The Dalai Lama refused to answer a question Monday about whether Tibetan monks should stop setting themselves on fire to protest China's occupation of Tibet. ""No answer,"" he said. ""I think that this is quite a sensitive political issue,"" the spiritual leader of the Tibetan Buddhist community said. Self-immolation is becoming an increasingly common form of protest for Tibetans who want genuine autonomy from China and accuse Beijing of repression. More than 30 of them took place in the last year in China, Tibetan advocacy groups say. The Dalai Lama was speaking in London, where he is accepting the Templeton Prize. He said he did not want to manipulate or politicize the event. ""Last year, I retired from political responsibility,"" he said. The Dalai Lama broke with four centuries of Tibetan tradition by separating the political aspect of his role from the spiritual one, he explained. He handed over political leadership of the Tibetan community to an elected prime minister in 2011. The Templeton Prize, an award worth ÃÂ£1.1 million ($1.77 million), honors ""outstanding individuals who have devoted their talents to expanding our vision of human purpose and ultimate reality.""

"(CNN) -- How does Sen. Marco Rubio curry favor with Hispanic voters and at the same time burnish his tea party credentials? Easy. By saying one thing and doing another. On May 10, Rubio, a Florida Republican, attempted to reframe his Dream Act proposal to give special visas to children of undocumented workers if they attend college or serve in the military. He said, ""But I would just say this is really not an immigration issue; it's a humanitarian issue."" On that same day, he quietly submitted a bill that would severely threaten humanitarian assistance to nearly 4 million children living in poverty. These are U.S. citizens. But to Rubio they are guilty by association. Through no fault of their own their parents are undocumented workers. Currently, a credit is available to undocumented workers who report their income to the IRS through the Individual Taxpayer Identification Number program, created in 1996, making them eligible for a Child Tax Credit. For many children, this payment ($1,000 per child) is the difference between abject poverty and the ability to survive. The program is, in fact, the ultimate conservative brainchild. It's not a handout; rather it's a way to give working people the ability to subsist, and to keep their children off entitlement programs. It is the kind of program that Ronald Reagan championed in the 1980s as a dignified alternative to welfare for the working poor. Rubio's proposal -- the Responsible Child Tax Credit Eligibility Verification Act of 2012 -- would stiffen the filing requirements for Individual Taxpayer Identification Number applicants. This is being done, according to a Rubio spokesperson, in an attempt to ""crack down on fraud at the expense of taxpayers."" The Center for American Progress characterizes Rubio's contentions as overstated, and says the proposed bill will greatly harm innocent children who rely on the tax cuts for food on the table, school books and shelter. There is nothing ""humanitarian"" about terminating assistance to nearly 4 million American children who depend on such support. And there is nothing humanitarian about his ""DREAM Act without the dream,"" a palliative offer of legality without a clear path to citizenship. Such a proposal is nothing more than crumbs thrown to Latinos, who Rubio apparently hopes aren't paying attention. Lurking near the top of the list of running mates for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, Rubio is seen by many in the GOP as the key to the Latino vote. Yet the heart of his GOP support comes from the anti-immigration extreme right, while an overwhelming majority of Hispanics support immigration reform. It can't be easy for this son of a maid and a bus driver -- both Cuban immigrants -- to reconcile those contradictions. Would a Latino running mate help Romney? The hypocrisy of Rubio's recent moves paints a vivid picture of the unbridled ambition of an individual who plays on the politics of resentment and fear at the expense of children. Imagine a patient in critical condition bleeding of multiple stab wounds. Rubio talks about putting a Band-Aid on the patient's little finger, while silently stabbing him in the back. In March I wrote that ""Rubio Needs a 'Nixon in China' Moment,"" insisting that the senator should use his conservative credentials to courageously break the logjam in immigration reform. I was at first encouraged to see him step into this debate, but unlike the rabidly anti-Communist Nixon, who traveled to China to promote dÃÂ©tente, Rubio instead travels to key battleground states -- Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia, tea party turf -- to peddle his autobiography. It's unfortunate that two of Rubio's closest mentors, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Florida GOP Rep. Ileana Ros Lehtinen, who both support comprehensive immigration reform, can't shake their protÃÂ©gÃÂ© by the shoulders and set him straight. Navarrette: What Latinos want from candidates? Respect . Perhaps they could suggest that he turn from promoting his own book to studying Robert Caro's recently published ""The Passage of Power,"" the fourth installment of the biography of Lyndon Johnson. Caro depicts a scene the night before LBJ's first major address as president, to a joint session of Congress, in which his closest advisers urged him not to make civil rights a central tenet of his presidency. They argued it would antagonize the conservative Southerners who controlled Congress, and threaten his presidency. Caro writes that one adviser ""told him to his face that a president shouldn't spend his time and power on lost causes, no matter how worthy those causes might be."" The former conservative senator from Texas retorted, ""Well, what the hell's the presidency for?"" LBJ's leadership and political genius in passing civil rights legislation brought a measure of justice for millions of people to whom justice had long been denied. As Rubio abandons Hispanic families, he should ask himself: ""What the hell is a Senate seat for?"" He sure doesn't seem to know. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Charles Garcia.","Charles Garcia: Marco Rubio has been hypocritical on the immigration issue .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- President Barack Obama marked the first anniversary of the death of terror mastermind Osama bin Laden with an unannounced visit to Afghanistan, signing a long-awaited strategic partnership agreement meant to set the conditions of an American withdrawal from the war-torn nation. The president reiterated that U.S. forces will not remain ""a single day longer"" than necessary, that he remains committed to pulling 23,000 troops out of the country by September and that he will stick to a 2014 deadline to fully withdraw from Afghanistan. ""We will not build permanent bases in this country, nor will we be patrolling its cities and mountains,"" the president said during a nationally televised speech to the U.S. people from Bagram Air Base early on Wednesday (Tuesday evening in the United States). ""That will be the job of the Afghan people."" An undetermined number of U.S. forces will remain in country past 2014 working as military advisers and counterterrorism forces, but officials have yet to decide for how long. The trip comes as Obama's election campaign gears up and just weeks ahead of a NATO summit in Chicago, where the details of the transition and future commitments to the region are expected to be discussed. Speaking to reporters from Turkey after the trip to Afghanistan, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Michigan, and member Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island, pointed to a series of lightening-rod issues expected to be addressed at the summit. They include hot topics such as Taliban and Haqqani safe havens in Pakistan, Afghan economic dependency on international spending and the grittier details of senior leadership positions within the nation's armed forces. ""One thing we're going to see if there can be an early retirement of the officer corps to make room for the younger class (of Pashtuns from the country's restive southern and eastern provinces),"" said Levin, noting those groups are underrepresented. ""That's something that's going to be discussed in Chicago, a retirement incentive,"" he said, a subtle nod to lingering questions over the army's current legitimacy in traditional Taliban strongholds. Going back to the Vietnam War era, American television networks have covered presidents speaking to military personnel or alongside foreign leaders overseas. But Obama's speech was the first televised address to the nation delivered from a war zone on foreign soil, according to White House spokesman Josh Earnest. The president's trip was his third since taking office and comes amid heightened tensions between the Obama and Karzai governments after a string of incidents involving U.S. personnel. Among them include an American service member charged with killing of 16 Afghan civilians, Quran burnings at a U.S. military base and the release of photographs of Americans posing with the remains of dead militants. Read extensive excerpts of the speech . Meanwhile, two U.S. service members were killed and two were wounded in an explosion targeting their vehicle in Wardak province, officials said. About two hours after Obama left the country, a powerful explosion rocked the capital. Authorities later reported that it was a suicide car bomb that detonated outside the gates of Green Village, a compound that houses contractors and aid workers. The attack left at least seven people and wounded 17 others, including schoolchildren, officials said. ""This is another desperate attack by the Taliban,"" said NATO spokesman Gen. Carsten Jacobson. ""Another attack by the insurgency that resulted in the deaths of innocent Afghan civilians, with most of that being children from a nearby school."" The U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said that the ""indiscriminate and illegal attacks are unacceptable and that those responsible are fully accountable for the deaths and injuries of civilians."" In an e-mail, the Taliban denied there were civilian casualties and said it planned the attack after word circulated that the American president was going to be in Afghanistan, marking the start of their so-called spring offensive. Obama also spoke of a ""negotiated peace"" and said his administration has been in direct talks with the Taliban. In March, the Afghan Taliban suspended the development of a diplomatic office in Qatar designed to allow them to hold talks with the United States, following public anger over the killing of the 16 civilians. ""We've made it clear that they can be a part of this future if they break with al Qaeda, renounce violence and abide by Afghan laws,"" Obama said Wednesday. See reactions to Obama's surprise trip . Addressing Afghan concerns that America will abandon the country once its troops leave, Obama noted, ""With this agreement, I am confident that the Afghan people will understand that the United States will stand by them."" He later added that the U.S. ""did not come here to claim resources or to claim territory. We came here with a very clear mission to destroy al Qaeda."" Karzai offered his thanks to the American people for helping Afghanistan, and the presidents shook hands after signing the Strategic Partnership Agreement in the atrium of the King's Residence, part of the Presidential Palace in Kabul. ""This agreement will close the season of the past 10 years and is going to open an equal relationship season,"" Karzai added. ""With the signing of this agreement, we are starting a phase between two sovereign and independent countries that will be based on mutual respect, mutual commitments and mutual friendship."" The security risks in Afghanistan seemed particularly pronounced given the secretive nature and timing of the trip. Obama landed in Afghanistan in the cover of darkness, and the signing ceremony occurred in the early morning hours. Presumptive GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney said, ""I am pleased that President Obama has returned to Afghanistan."" ""Our troops and the American people deserve to hear from our president about what is at stake in this war,"" he said. ""Success in Afghanistan is vital to our nation's security."" More than 130,000 troops from 50 countries serve in Afghanistan. The United States is the largest contributor, providing some 90,000 troops, followed by the United Kingdom (9,500), Germany (4,800) and France (3,600). But war that began with widespread approval in 2001 is now increasingly unpopular in Europe and the United States. The latest CNN/ORC International poll in late March show 55% of respondents would like to see the U.S. remove all its forces before 2014. More than 2,700 troops from the United States and its partners have died in the conflict. The majority of them American. Last week, Afghan National Security Adviser Rangin Daftar Spanta and U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker initialed the text that outlined the kind of relationship the two countries want in the decade following the NATO withdrawal. The deal had been long expected after Washington and Kabul found compromises over the thorny issues of ""night raids"" by U.S. forces on Afghan homes and the transfer of U.S. detainees to Afghan custody. It seeks to create an enduring partnership that prevents the Taliban from waiting out a U.S. withdrawal to try to regain power, the senior administration officials have said. CNN's David Ariosto, Tom Cohen, Barbara Starr, Keating Holland, Nick Paton Walsh and journalist Masoud Popalzai contributed to this report.","NEW: Sen.

"Washington (CNN) -- Investigators have uncovered no evidence to suggest a Maryland man taken in custody after allegedly threatening his workplace had acquired weapons illegally, a law enforcement official said Saturday. The man is undergoing a mental health evaluation at Anne Arundel Medical Center, officials said. The evaluation could take a week, according to Julie Parker, spokeswoman for Prince George's County police. County authorities directed reporters to an official Twitter feed that identified the man as Neil Prescott. The post by the county state's attorney's office said no formal charges have been filed. The employee was in the process of being fired and was taken into custody Friday after a phone conversation with a supervisor, police said. According to police, the man called himself a ""joker"" and then said, ""I'm gonna load my guns and blow everybody up."" Police in the counties of Prince George's and Anne Arundel acted on the alleged threat and the use of the word ""joker."" The Joker is the nemesis of the comic character Batman and a character in the film the ""Dark Knight Rises."" Police say the suspect in last Friday's shooting inside a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, where the film was being shown, identified himself afterward to police as ""the Joker."" James Holmes has been arrested in the shooting, in which 12 people were killed and scores more wounded. ""An individual who was in the process of being fired was involved in two separate conversations with his supervisor,"" Prince George's County Police Chief Mark Magaw told reporters. ""Both of those times and both of those telephone conversations he made significant threats to coming back and harming people at the business."" Magaw added, ""In fact, he said 'I'm a joker and I'm gonna load my guns and blow everyone up.'"" A search of the man's apartment yielded 25 guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition, Magaw said. Magaw said police went Thursday afternoon to the man's apartment in Crofton to interview him and found him wearing a T-shirt that said, ""Guns don't kill people. I do."" Later in the day, a district court judge issued a court order for the man to be held on an emergency commitment. ""We believe this was a significant threat based on some of the mental issues this individual has, the weapon capability he had (and) what he said to the employees at Pitney Bowes,"" Magaw said, referring to the business involved. Magaw said that, given Pitney Bowes' status as a federal contractor, the man could be subject to federal charges.","Investigators have no information guns acquired illegally, official says .

"(CNN) -- Testing on blood found in the home of a missing Maine toddler has determined that some of it belonged to the girl, police said Sunday. ""The state crime lab confirms some of the blood samples are Ayla's,"" said Stephen McCausland, a spokesman for the Maine Department of Public Safety, referring to young Ayla Reynolds. The girl's mother, Trista Reynolds, learned of the news Saturday, McCausland said. A website created by Ayla's family disclosed the police findings in a posting Sunday, saying investigators told them the blood found was ""more ... than a small cut would produce."" Police declined to comment on the website posting beyond confirming that testing revealed some of the blood was Ayla's. Earlier Sunday, McCausland said that while some of the blood found in the home's basement ""was visible to the naked eye, some wasn't."" The blood was discovered in the Waterville, Maine, home soon after Ayla was reported missing December 17. Crime scene investigators used a chemical called Luminol to detect blood that can't otherwise be seen, according to McCausland. Investigators, who disclosed the existence of the blood Saturday, won't say how much of it was found in the residence, or exactly where. At the same time, police are now publicly casting doubt on the accounts of the three adults -- the toddler's father, her aunt and the father's girlfriend -- who were in the home when the then-20-month old child was last seen -- saying they don't ""pass the 'straight-face' test in Maine."" ""We feel they know more than they're telling us,"" McCausland said Saturday. ""We don't think we got the full story."" Justin DiPietro, Ayla's father, did not respond to calls from CNN this weekend requesting comment on the latest developments. McCausland said Sunday that Ayla's father ""is still talking to us when we ask him to."" ""We've been trying to be diplomatic about his participation, and he talks with us when we ask him questions,"" the spokesman added. Justin DiPietro sleeps in the basement of the home, which is owned by his mother, Phoebe DiPietro. He told police that at 8 p.m. on December 16, he put his daughter to bed in her first-floor bedroom. He called police the next morning just before 9 a.m. to report her missing. On Sunday, police outlined where everyone was sleeping that night inside the small, one-story home. Ayla's aunt -- who also lives in the house -- slept with her own daughter in another first-floor bedroom, police said. That bedroom is across the hall from Ayla's room. Phoebe DiPietro also has a bedroom directly across the hallway from Ayla, but police say she was not home that night. Justin DiPietro slept in a basement room with his girlfriend and her son, according to McCausland. Police said the adults told them ""someone snuck into the house, went into the bedroom where Ayla was sleeping, and no one heard or saw anything."" Yet ""there is no evidence that we have found that would point to an abduction,"" said the state spokesman. ""We don't know what happened other than we know Ayla didn't walk out on her own, and we have grave doubts she was abducted because there were three adults in the home that night (and) it's a very small house,"" McCausland said. On Saturday, Ayla's parents appeared together publicly for the first time since their daughter's disappearance to thank those who have tried to help locate Ayla, CNN affiliate WCSH reported. Ayla's parents were asked about the discovery of blood in the basement. Justin DiPietro declined to answer, saying he only wanted to thank the public for their kindness, the television station reported. Trista Reynolds reacted emotionally. ""I'm ready to go knocking at people's door myself because I want to know what happened to my daughter, and I want to know where she is and who took her or just whatever, like everybody else does,"" she said. Reynolds told HLN's Nancy Grace last month that she raised Ayla for 18 months, and that DiPietro had become involved after she ""needed to go and get a little bit of help for myself."" She told HLN she entered rehab. Justin DiPietro had sole custody of Ayla when she disappeared. DiPietro has said he would never do anything to harm his daughter. ""I have to believe that Ayla is with somebody, and I just want that person to find the courage to do the right thing and find a way to return her safely,"" he said in a statement last month. No one has been arrested in the case, and police have not identified anyone else as a suspect. ""We're not ruling anyone in or anyone out,"" McCausland said. McCausland said Saturday that authorities revealed the blood's discovery six weeks into the case because ""we need information from the public, and we think this might help.""","Testing confirms some of the blood belongs to missing Ayla Reynolds .

"(CNN) -- A piece of tarp that reads, ""Welcome to you, God Bless You"" marks a barely-enclosed dirt field. At this orphanage, the only traces of shelter are the few tents that haven't yet been stripped by the strong winds. It's my last day in Haiti, and I'm on a trip to bring food, water and supplies to Haitians still displaced by the 2010 earthquake. The first stop is the orphanage, in the middle of one of Port-au-Prince's largest tent cities. When I step out of the Land Rover, I begin to see the children -- they come out from behind the tarp. They're dusty, sun-burnt, and smiling shyly. I'm again thankful for the camera in my hand, my constant companion this week. The lens is always ready to capture the utter desolation, which has my mind reeling even after a week. At the sight of the vat of water that's brought out from the car, the children abandon their toys: a soccer ball, a ragged stuffed animal, a paint-chipped wooden car. The youngest, still a toddler, takes the first sip. His cries, when the bottle is taken away from him, ensure one last turn before the water runs out. In Haiti, even a few drops of water can stop a boy's tears. My intentions of going to Haiti were less than purely philanthropic. As a journalist, I planned on seeing the devastation firsthand, but I also wanted to be productive and lend a helping hand. It wasn't without chagrin that I realized volunteering means choosing to give up control and becoming available and malleable to meet the needs of others. I've traveled to other developing countries, but I was still unprepared for the the chaos that met me when I arrived. After several lost-in-translation phone calls and hours of waiting at the airport, I took a leap of faith, got into an SUV with two men I've never met before, and prayed that I would survive -- literally. It was more than luck that led me to New Life Children's Home and Rescue Center, a different orphanage from the one I had originally signed up to work with. Here I was taken in with open arms by one of Haiti's ultimate volunteers, Miriam Frederick. Frederick has been fighting for Haiti for more than 30 years. She's the founder of New Life Children's Home and Rescue Center, which was established in 1977 and currently houses 130 children. On my first day at New Life, I met 8-year-old Lavita in the infirmary. She had been suffering from severe malnutrition at the tent-city orphanage, and Miriam took her in. ""When a child comes in here, many, you would not give a nickel for their life because they are so far gone,"" Frederick says. By the end of the week, Lavita is asking me to help twirl ropes with her, so her younger girlfriends can jump in on a match of double dutch. ""These kids don't just need basic provisions, they need love and they need brothers and sisters to play with them and teach them,"" says John Poitevent, a pastor at Christ Fellowship, in Palm Beach, Florida, which supports New Life. ""We felt like it was time that we can't just send our money. We've got to send ourselves also."" It's not often that painting church pews and scrubbing floors can generate the same enthusiasm as joining in on a game of soccer or playing a round of spoons after a long day. During my one-week stay with New Life, I witnessed entire bunk beds get built from scratch in a matter of days, boxes of medicine get organized, and water filters get distributed to the outskirts of Haiti. None of which could've been done without volunteers. As much as I felt productive organizing suitcases of donated clothing, the trip was an opportunity to be inspired through the people we met and by the selflessness we saw amid disheartening conditions. Take Frederick, who -- despite knowing that for every one child she helps, there are hundreds of ""tent-city orphans"" still suffering -- continues to fight. ""I have been just challenged by her and inspired by her to just step out in faith and to step out of my comfort zone,"" Poitevent says. He's not the only one. I met a high school soccer team, an older couple, a fellow Atlantan -- each a volunteer, a title that transcends age, race, career and even the fact that I only know two phrases in Creole. I went to Haiti expecting to walk away with images of a devastated Haiti -- and I did. The scene on my last day at the tent-city orphanage is unforgettable. However, I realize images of suffering aren't what drive volunteers to come back. It's doing even the small tasks so that a recovered Lavita has the strength to love on her fellow peers, which keeps us wanting to do more and believing that it can make a difference.","CNN's Janet Ahn traveled to Haiti to witness the earthquake devastation and help rebuild .

"(CNN) -- Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland claimed the first yellow jersey in the 99th edition of the Tour de France with a commanding victory in the opening prologue in Liege Saturday. Olympic champion Cancellara is a specialist against the clock and over a flat 6.4km course underlined his domination with a winning time of seven minutes 13.46 seconds. It left him seven seconds clear of the pre-race favorite for overall honors, Britain's Bradley Wiggins, with Frenchman Sylvain Chavanel (Omega-Pharma) in third place. Team Sky's Wiggins had edged out Chavanel by less than half a second to take the lead before RadioShack star Cancellara repeated his 2004 win in the Belgian city with another powerhouse performance. It was a welcome return to form for Cancellara, who had struggled in the early part of this year and made little impression in the spring classics. ""It's great. I'm really proud to have won here today eight years after my first Tour victory in Liege,"" Cancellara told Eurosport. The globalization of the Tour de France . ""It hasn't been the best season for me, but this really helps make amends."" Despite his defeat, Wiggins is left well-placed after the opening exchanges, gaining nearly 10 seconds on reigning Tour de France champion Cadel Evans, whose BMC teammate Tejay Van Garderen finished a promising fourth place. Giro d'Italia champion Ryder Hesjedal (Garmin-Sharp-Barracuda) finished one second adrift of Evans, the same time as Italian Vincenzo Nibali, rated by many as the main rival to Wiggins and Evans. But Frank Schleck of Luxembourg, who finished third overall last year, lost nearly half a minute to Wiggins, coming home 135th at 38 seconds behind teammate Cancellara. Germany's Tony Martin, who took the world time trial title from Cancellara last year, was left to rue a puncture, having to change bike and still coming home just 23 seconds down. Sunday's first stage takes in 198km from Liege to Seraing, with testing terrain likely to rule out the possibility of a bunch sprint.","Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland wins opening prologue in 2012 Tour de France .

"(CNN) -- Firefighters continued their efforts Saturday to corral more of a perilous Colorado blaze, following a week in which its flames have moved through forests and neighborhoods, forcing thousands of evacuations and leaving a trail of destruction. ""It will be some time before this fire is out, but our challenge now is to make sure we do everything to contain the damage,"" said Tom Vilsack, secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which includes the U.S. Forest Service, in Fort Collins. Vilsack addressed reporters shortly after touring the High Park Fire, which he noted is one of thousands currently burning nationwide. Red flag warnings, noting alarmingly high chances of wildfire activity, have been issued by the National Weather Service in nine states including Colorado. At more than 54,000 acres burned, it is not the biggest -- the agriculture secretary noted that he was heading next to New Mexico where the Whitewater Baldy complex has scorched more than 290,000 acres -- but it has been under the spotlight for its speed and affect on people and property. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper held up a picture at Saturday afternoon's press conference of the tree that he said was struck by lightning eight days earlier, the first spark for the mammoth blaze. ""It smouldered all day Friday, and it exploded (last) Saturday,"" Hickenlooper said of the resulting fire. First measured at two acres last Saturday morning, High Park Fire grew exponentially in the hours. At one point, it was advancing at 20 to 40 feet per second, with 15- to 20-foot flames common and some reaching as high as 300 feet, according to Nick Christensen of the Larimer County Sheriff's Office. In recent days, the blaze jumped the Poudre River and was racing up a drainage area toward nearby neighborhoods. Even then, fire authorities had been optimistic they would do more to control the blaze on Saturday, when it was 20% contained. ""This containment is expected to increase today,"" read an update on InciWeb, the U.S. multiagency Incident Fire Response website. Going forward, it doesn't appear there will be much cooling or calming around Fort Collins and surrounding areas that would help those efforts. The National Weather Service forecast calls for high day-time temperatures in the mid-90s and breezy conditions, with gusts expected as strong as 25 mph, through Tuesday. Hundreds of firefighters have arrived from across the United States to help local departments in the cause. In all, Inciweb reports 1,533 personnel are on site, employing 103 fire engines and 16 water tenders and numerous aircraft, including 16 helicopters. Besides the still raging flames, an additional danger is presenting itself in the form of hungry and scared bears, officials said. Firefighters have been keeping their distance. The fire has claimed one life, a 62-year-old woman found dead in her burned home earlier this week. At least 181 homes have been destroyed by the fire, while about 3,000 evacuation notices have been sent out (some of which have been since recalled). ""It's really not just a list of numbers; these are stories.

"(CNN) -- A Montreal teacher has been suspended for showing his 10th grade students the killing and dismemberment video allegedly filmed by Canadian gay porn actor Luka Magnotta, the school board said on Wednesday . The class viewing allegedly took place on the morning of June 4, the same day German authorities captured Magnotta in a Berlin Internet cafÃÂ©, ending an international manhunt for the suspected killer. Jun Lin, a 33-year-old student at Montreal's Concordia University, was killed in late May in one of the city's grisliest crimes in years. Police say they believe Magnotta killed and dismembered Lin and posted a 10-minute video of the slaying online. Montreal police Cmdr. Ian Lafreniere said the video shows Magnotta engaged in sexual acts involving body parts and included evidence of cannibalism. Victim's family recalls his 'love of life' ""At the beginning of class each day, history teachers from the school talk about actuality, what happens around Montreal, and that was part of the actuality that day, so he wanted to talk about it, and kids said that they wanted to watch it, so basically he just did what the kids wanted to do,"" student Carole-Anne Bouchard-Giroux told CNN affiliate CTV. One of the vice principals at Cavelier-De LaSalle High School in Montreal overheard two students speaking between classes shortly after the incident, school board representative Jean-Michel Nahas said. The vice principal spoke to several students and decided during lunch to immediately suspend the teacher and launch an investigation. Around 20 students viewed the video, and at least six students sought help from a crisis team of psychologists and counselors that was made available to students after the incident, Nahas said. The 29-year-old suspended teacher wrote the vice principal an e-mail later in the day apologizing for his actions and was ""sorry for all the damages that could have been caused by the video,"" Nahas said. Nahas said the school board is not releasing the teacher's name because of the ongoing investigation. Nahas said he still wasn't sure how the teacher was technically capable of showing the video. ""There are many filters on the computers at the school and when we tried to view it ourselves, we were not able to,"" he said. ""It was impossible to view it [over the school Internet connection] so we don't know how he was even able to."" Additional psychologists and counselors were made available to students again Wednesday because of the sudden media attention. The suspended teacher met with the school board Wednesday afternoon in Montreal. The board wants to know ""why he did it, if he has any justification of it, and what he has to say about it,"" Nahas said while the meeting was in progress. A statement released after the meeting said the board met with the teacher, who presented his version of events. The school board will investigate further before deciding the fate of the teacher, the release said. The school and the board ""reiterate that this is an unconscionable act for which all consequences are considered, up to dismissal of the teacher,"" the release said. The teacher is suspended with pay pending completion of the board's investigation. Opinion: The sick fascination with a death video .","Montreal school suspends teacher, is investigating incident .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A CIA contractor who killed two Pakistani men was released from jail Wednesday after compensation was paid to the victims' families, the result of an intense diplomatic tug-of-war that strained ties between the United States and its all-important ally Pakistan. Raymond Davis -- who has now left Pakistan, according to a U.S. official not authorized to speak for attribution -- had been in jail since January. But the families of two men he killed forgave him, a government official said Wednesday. ""The families of the victims ... have pardoned Raymond Davis,"" said Cameron Munter, the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan.  ""I am grateful for their generosity.  I wish to express, once again, my regret for the incident and my sorrow at the suffering it caused."" The U.S. official told CNN that Davis is now in Kabul, Afghanistan, for medical examination and rest. Davis' wife in Colorado was notified of Pakistan's decision soon after his departure from there, the source said. The episode illustrated U.S. consternation with Pakistan, and initially sparked rage in the Asian nation over the killings. The United States -- pressuring its key ally in the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban to release Davis -- at one point sent Sen. John Kerry to Pakistan to meet with officials there, and members of Congress told Pakistani leaders that billions of dollars in U.S. aid were in jeopardy unless Davis was released. It is not known who paid the compensation to the families, and there are conflicting reports over the amount. A lawyer closely connected to the case said the compensation was $1.4 million, but Punjab province law minister Rana Sanaullah said $2.34 million was paid to the legal heirs by the U.S. government. The U.S. official not authorized to speak for attribution insisted that the release of Davis was a decision made by the Pakistanis, and that there was ""no quid pro quo"" between Washington and Islamabad.  The official refused to comment on whether there was a exchange of so-called ""blood money."" It was Pakistani officials who worked with the family in making the arrangements for what is referred to as ""blood money,"" the official told CNN. The United States ""did not sit across from the families"" to work out an arrangement, but the official acknowledged there were ""interagency discussions and a policy decision"" -- in other words a White House sign off -- for the United States to agree to the arrangement, the official said. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who said ""we are very grateful"" for the decision of the families that enabled Davis ""to leave Pakistan and head home,"" stressed that the U.S. government didn't pay any compensation to the families and she wouldn't say whether the Pakistanis or a third party did. ""We also have a Department of Justice investigation that has begun into what happened in Lahore. And we've communicated our strong support for the relationship between Pakistan and the United States, which we consider to be of strategic importance,"" Clinton said during a press conference Wednesday. Sanaullah first told Pakistani media Wednesday that the victims' families did not want to press charges and added soon after that Davis was free to go. The statement came just hours after the American was charged with murder in connection with the January shootings. Sanaullah later said $1,169,500 was paid to 11 legal heirs of one victim and the same amount was paid to eight legal heirs of the others. Davis appeared in the Lahore court after the payment was made and was acquitted of the charges, in accordance with an Islamic practice known as diyat, or compensation, the lawyer said. ""Diyat,"" a part of Islamic law that is enshrined in Pakistan's penal code, allows victims to pardon a murderer with or without being paid ""blood money,"" the former chief justice of Pakistan's Supreme Court, Saeed U Zaman Saddiqi, told CNN. On a second charge, illegal possession of a firearm, Davis was fined $250 and sentenced to time already served, the lawyer noted. According to Davis, the January 27 shooting occurred after two men attacked him as he drove through a busy Lahore neighborhood, the U.S. Embassy has said. The United States had been seeking the release of Davis from a Lahore jail on the grounds that he has diplomatic immunity. But a high court in Pakistan refused Monday to decide whether the CIA contractor has diplomatic immunity, sending the case back to a lower court, the official Associated Press of Pakistan reported. The lower court had already ruled that Davis does not enjoy protected diplomatic status because neither he nor the Pakistani government has provided documents proving that he does. U.S. officials originally said Davis was a diplomat and later revealed that he is a CIA contractor, intensifying the already highly charged situation. Pakistan is a key U.S. ally in efforts against al Qaeda and the Taliban in neighboring Afghanistan, and the shooting deaths outraged many Pakistanis. CIA spokesman George Little said Wednesday the agency and its ""Pakistani counterparts have had a strong relationship for years. ""When issues arise, it's our standing practice to work through them,"" Little said in a statement. ""That's the sign of a healthy partnership -- one that's vital to both countries, especially as we face a common set of terrorist enemies."" The U.S. Justice Department has opened an investigation into the incident and department spokeswoman Laura Sweeney said it ""will take all necessary and appropriate law enforcement steps in our ongoing criminal investigation."" ""Due to the ongoing nature of this investigation, we aren't in a position to provide additional details at this time,"" Sweeney said. In Highland Park, Colorado, Davis' wife, Rebecca, spoke to reporters outside the couple's home. She appeared relieved and animated about her husband's possible return home within the next week or so. She told reporters that she wouldn't cry but she became tearful when she spoke about how U.S. government officials supported her, even staying in contact on Valentine's Day and the couple's anniversary. The couple met at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, she said. ""Everybody laughs about my intuition but I just knew in my gut that he would be home,"" Rebecca Davis said. While in jail, he sent her letters saying, "" 'I love you. I miss you.' This is not something he would wish on his worst enemy,"" she said. ""It wasn't a pleasant thing, but it could have been so much worse,"" Rebecca Davis said.

"London (CNN) -- The Olympic torch began its 70-day, 8,000-mile journey around Britain Saturday from Land's End in Cornwall, with three-time Olympic gold medal winner Ben Ainslie the first to carry the torch. Ainslie, a sailor who grew up in Cornwall, southwest England, passed the torch on to 18-year-old surfer Anastassia Swallow, the second torchbearer. More than 100 people will carry the flame on the first day of its long voyage, during which it will take in towns, villages and cities across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland before reaching London. The Olympic flame arrived at a Royal Naval Air Station in Cornwall on Friday, carried by Princess Anne, the president of the British Olympic Association and also an Olympian. She received the flame at an elaborate handover ceremony in Athens Thursday. The flame had been on an eight-day journey round Greece after being lit at ancient Olympia, birthplace of the Olympics, on May 10. The flame was also accompanied on its flight from Greece by footballer David Beckham, London Mayor Boris Johnson and Sebastian Coe, head of the London 2012 organizing group. ""The arrival of the Olympic Flame on home soil is a magical moment for any host country,"" Coe said. ""It will connect millions of people around the UK to the Games in a unique way and allows us to celebrate the best of the UK and its people."" The route for the torch relay has been designed so that the flame will pass within 10 miles of 95% of the U.K. population before its arrival at the Olympic Stadium in London on July 27. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who greeted the flame on its arrival in Cornwall, said it was the start of an exciting journey. ""Today, the Olympic flame begins its journey across the nation. 8,000 people will pass it from hand to hand, a human chain that reaches the length and breadth of Britain. ""It will visit a thousand towns, and be seen by millions; with every step, the excitement will build. And 10 weeks from now, the world will watch as the flame arrives at the new Olympic Stadium, bringing with it the hopes of a nation,"" Clegg said. London last hosted the Olympic Games in 1948.","The 70-day torch relay started in Land's End, Cornwall, and will finish in London .

"(CNN) -- President Obama rallied U.S. troops and pledged continued partnership with Afghanistan during a previously unannounced trip to the country Sunday. Speaking to about 2,000 U.S. and allied troops at the major U.S. base in Afghanistan, Obama said, ""Those folks back home are relying on you."" ""I know it's not easy,"" he said. ""You're far away from home. You miss your kids, you miss your spouses, your family, your friends."" But he added, ""If I thought for a minute that America's vital interests were not served, were not at stake here in Afghanistan, I would order all of you home right away."" Earlier, Obama met with Afghan President Hamid Karzai at the Presidential Palace to discuss progress by the Afghan government in strengthening its ability to run the country and provide security for its people. After the 30-minute meeting, Obama said he wanted to send a strong message that the partnership between the nations would continue. Obama also invited Karzai to Washington, and White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said the planned date for that visit is May 12. Karzai said he wanted to ""express the gratitude of our people for the help that America has given us for the last eight years,"" and he specifically thanked U.S. taxpayers for their aid in helping rebuild his country. Time.com: Obama arrives in Afghanistan . However, Obama made clear that his main reason for the trip was to visit with some of the roughly 80,000 U.S. troops stationed in the country. After changing from a suit to an Air Force One flight jacket, Obama told the troops they were making progress against al Qaeda and its allies in the Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist militia that ruled most of Afghanistan before the 9/11 attacks. ""All of that makes America safer, and we are going to keep them on the run,"" he said. ""Because that is what is going to be required in order to ensure that our families back home have the security that they need."" To cheers from the combined joint task force that includes troops from all four services, Obama said: ""The United States of America does not quit once it starts on something. ... We keep at it. We persevere. And together, with our partners, we will prevail. I am absolutely confident of that."" Following his speech to the troops, Obama met with U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry and Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the commander of allied troops in Afghanistan, before his scheduled departure for the flight home. Obama's trip began in secrecy, with the president leaving his Camp David retreat. He flew to Afghanistan on Air Force One, landing at Bagram Air Base at 7:24 p.m. (around 11 a.m. ET). Obama then flew on a helicopter to the Presidential Palace to meet with Karzai. The two presidents took part in a 10-minute arrival ceremony before walking into the palace for their meeting. U.S. officials said the two leaders planned to first meet along with key aides, and then bring in Karzai's cabinet. In a briefing with pool reporters on the trip, National Security Adviser James Jones said Obama would push Karzai to improve efforts to meet benchmarks for better governance in his second term, which began last year. According to Jones, Obama planned to point out that certain issues such as a merit-based system for appointing key government officials, battling corruption and taking on narcotics trafficking that helps fund insurgents needed more attention. ""We have to have the strategic rapport with President Karzai and his Cabinet to understand how we are going to succeed this year in reversing the momentum the Taliban and the opposition forces have been able to establish since 2006,"" Jones said. A senior administration official said Obama told Karzai that some progress had been made, particularly involving local governance, establishing more credible national institutions and battling corruption. The senior official characterized the meeting as very productive and businesslike. Related: Afghanistan Crossroads . The trip came after what has been perhaps the most successful week of Obama's presidency, in which he signed comprehensive health care legislation -- his top domestic priority -- into law and announced plans to sign a new nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia on April 8. Gibbs said Afghan authorities were notified of Obama's trip on Thursday. The president previously postponed a trip to Indonesia and Australia planned for March 21-26 in order to see through passage of the health care bill. Since taking office, Obama ordered the deployment of an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan while also saying he intended for combat forces to start coming home in July 2011. U.S. officials said Sunday there were nearly 80,000 U.S. troops now on the ground in Afghanistan, and the surge announced by Obama would increase the total to 98,000 once fully implemented by the end of the year. Roughly 10,000 of the 30,000 surge troops were in place now, officials said. In addition, NATO partners have more than 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, according to the officials. Karzai has said that by the end of 2010, Afghan security forces will be able to take over some security responsibilities from international forces. By the end of his second term in 2014, Karzai has said he would like his government to have full responsibility for security. Karzai emerged victorious from August presidential elections that were marred by widespread fraud. Two months after the vote, a U.N.-backed panel of election monitors threw out nearly a third of Karzai's votes, citing fraud. Left short of a majority, Karzai agreed to a runoff with challenger Abdullah Abdullah, but Abdullah withdrew just before the runoff vote. The trip is Obama's second to Afghanistan. He first traveled there in 2008, four months before his victory in the election that made him president. On that visit, part of a broader trip to the Middle East, Obama traveled to eastern Afghanistan to meet with U.S. forces and also met with Karzai.","President Obama tells troops: ""Those folks back home are relying on you""
