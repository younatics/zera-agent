"While many lawmakers have been denouncing the Staten Island grand jury decision not to indict white police officer Daniel Pantaleo in the July chokehold death of an unarmed black man, Eric Garner, Rep. Peter King, R-New York, has been taking a different approach. On Wednesday, King tweeted his gratitude to the jury for ""doing justice"" in their handling of the case. ""Thanks to SI grand jury for doing justice & not yielding to outside pressure,"" King tweeted. ""Decision must be respected. Compassion for the Garner family. "" Later, he told Wolf Blitzer on CNN's ""The Situation Room"" that he feels ""strongly"" the police officer should not have been indicted, arguing that there is no way he could have known that Garner's health conditions would affect his ability to survive the chokehold. ""The police had no reason to know he was in serious condition,"" King said. ""You had a 350-pound person who was resisting arrest. The police were trying to bring him down as quickly as possible. If he had not had asthma and a heart condition and was so obese, almost definitely he would not have died."" The New York congressman also suggested that the officers had no reason to stop suppressing Garner, even though he stressed multiple times that he could not breathe. ""People were saying that he said seven times, 'I can't breathe.' But if you can't breathe, you can't talk,"" King said. ""So police hear that all the time."" King also defended the officer's decision to use the chokehold as an arrest procedure. ""In this case, a chokehold was not illegal,"" King said. ""It is against department regulations, but as you look carefully, I don't think it was an intent to put him in a chokehold, because [the officer] does move the baton as he brings him down."" Obama on Garner verdict: 'We are not going to let up' King, who grew up in New York, and has represented the state in Congress for nearly 22 years, also claimed no organization has done more to protect young African-Americans in New York City than the New York Police Department. This is not the first time King has voiced his support for a jury's decision not to indict a white police officer in the death of an unarmed black man. Last week, King said that the President should invite Wilson to meet with him at the White House. ""I think it would be very helpful if President Obama went and met with the police officer, or at least invited him to the White House,"" King said on Fox Business Network. ""And say, 'you've gone through four months of smear and slander and the least we can do is tell you that it is unfortunate that it happened and thank you for doing your job.'""","New York Rep. Peter King, a Republican, praised the State Island grand jury's decision on Wednesday .

"Washington (CNN)If Republican leaders can quell conservative dissatisfaction with House Speaker John Boehner, and no further drama comes out from the House leadership's No. 3 Rep. Steve Scalise, GOP heads hope to get back on track with their aggressive agenda to forcefully confront President Barack Obama on the top issues of the day, including the Keystone XL pipeline, immigration, health care and national security. Republicans believe their legislative plans will sharpen for voters the contrast between the GOP and Democrats, and set the stage for the 2016 presidential and congressional elections. ""The first thing we need to do is demonstrate we heard what the voters were saying on Nov. 4.  To me, they said we want you to function and we want you to solve problems,"" Texas GOP Senator John Cornyn, the number two Republican leader, told CNN. Republicans have a long list of priorities, chief among them unraveling many of the president's signature policies on energy, health care, the environment, and banking. Their job won't be easy because for any bill to get through the Senate, the 54 Republicans will need a handful of Democratic votes. Republican leaders say they want to put on the floor compromise bills that can bridge the ideological gap between the most conservative members of the GOP and a small group of centrist Democrats who might vote with them. In addition, the President is vowing to veto major changes to his signature health care law or the recent immigration reforms he ordered. So anything Republicans hope to get signed into law will have to be negotiated with Obama, who they fiercely stood up to during his first six years in office. ""When the American people elect divided government, they're not saying they don't want anything done,"" a collaborative sounding incoming Senate Majority leader Sen. Mitch McConnell recently told CNN's Dana Bash.  ""What they are saying is they want things done in the political center, things that both sides can agree on."" In a sign of how important Republicans are taking their new responsibilities, House and Senate Republicans will huddle in a rare joint retreat in Hershey, Pennsylvania in mid-January to finalize and unite around their strategies for 2015. Approval of the Keystone pipeline, which the administration has delayed for years, tops the GOP agenda. Votes are planned on the House and Senate floor during the first two weeks of January. GOP leaders also plan quick votes on Obamacare and immigration. RELATED: Obama, Senate GOP to test new relationship . If they pass, the President would be forced to either accept or reject the bills.  Republicans believe they win either way: If he signs them, Republicans will have accomplishment to point to.  If he vetoes them, the GOP can blame the President for blocking bipartisan bills. ""Hopefully, the President will follow our lead and go in a different direction,"" McConnell said. McConnell has said also he wants to allow Democratic amendments to GOP bills, something Republicans were denied regularly by Democrats when they controlled the Senate. In doing so, McConnell believes he can build good will across the aisle and grow support for individual bills. He believes also, strategically, that Democrats will quickly run through a series of hot-button Democratic issues -- like bolstering EPA regulations and boosting the minimum wage -- that could be more difficult for GOP senators running again in swing states to vote on if they took place closer to the election. In the House, Boehner will have a larger majority -- 246 GOP seats -- and aides from both parties expect the Speaker will be able to bypass Democrats push through most legislation with mainly Republican votes.  But because the continued internal tensions between conservatives and those GOP members hoping to resolve key policy issues will persist, Boehner might again need to turn to Democrats on key spending or fiscal matters. ""If we didn't have the President we'd be shuttered off to the side -- we don't care what you think,"" Rep Steny Hoyer, the number two House Democrat told CNN.  While he said he was willing to work with GOP leaders, Hoyer said even in the minority Democrats would remain relevant in major policy debates because of GOP defections, and a key role for Democrats in the new Congress would be to work with the president to sustain any vetoes. Here is a look at what Republicans have in the works: . Keystone/energy -- Republicans say construction of the pipeline is an easy way to create jobs and lessen U.S. dependence on oil from the Middle East.   A Senate bill fell one vote shy of the 60 needed to overcome a Democratic filibuster in November.  Republican leaders are confident they can pass it now but acknowledge it's unlikely they can get 67 votes to override a presidential veto. RELATED: Senate eyes Keystone fight . Economy/jobs -- In 2014, House Republicans passed a series of narrowly focused bills designed to create new jobs. Many of these rolled back federal regulations on manufacturers, which the GOP argued prevented businesses from expanding. Some passed with bipartisan support but hit a wall in the Democratic-controlled Senate.  Now Republicans are scheduling new votes on these same bills in both chambers and hope to garner enough support to send them to the President. Obamacare -- The day after the midterm election Boehner and McConnell promised to keep up their effort to repeal Obamacare, which not a single Republican voted for when it was enacted.  They recognize they don't have the votes to get over a certain presidential veto of a complete repeal so are looking at smaller changes to the law that are supported by bipartisan lawmakers. The first week back House GOP leaders scheduled votes on two measures increase the threshold employers have to reach to provide healthcare to workers from 30 to 40 hours per week.  One GOP bill deals narrowly with changing the law to encourage hiring more veterans and another is a broader proposal affecting all businesses. Votes are likely on doing away with the medical device tax that helps pay for the law. There is an internal debate among Republicans whether to use a special budget tool -- known as ""reconciliation"" -- that could allow them to pass a repeal in the Senate with just 51 votes.  But because the President has said he will veto that bill, some Republicans want to save reconciliation, which can only be used once, for another priority, like tax reform, entitlement changes, or energy policy. Immigration: Boehner vowed he would fight ""tooth and nail"" to reverse the president's executive actions, enacted in November, to allow roughly 5 million undocumented workers to remain in the U.S.  Funding for the Department of Homeland Security runs out at the end of February. Late last year, Republicans would only agree to fund the agency, which needs to carry out the immigration orders, until then because they want to try to force the President to reverse course. The standoff has the risk of shuttering the department, which responds to terrorism, natural disasters and other politically-sensitive matters.  Republicans are readying action on this issue soon -- likely in the House in the second week of January. Tax reform: Members have both parties have stressed they want to simplify the tax code, but a major impasse has prevented progress.  Republicans oppose measures that could be characterized as a tax hike.  Democrats want to expand current tax breaks such as the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit, but some in the GOP argue these are abused by undocumented workers.  Democrats also want to close loopholes for corporations, which Republicans oppose. Foreign policy and National Security: Cuba, Iran, Iraq and Syria likely will dominate the agenda.  Republicans are vowing to push back on the President's executive actions to restore diplomatic relations with Cuba but aren't settled on a strategy yet on how to do it.  They also oppose his negotiations with Iran over that nation's nuclear program and may quickly call a vote on a bipartisan bill to increase sanctions on Iran.  That could upset the delicate multinational talks that were recently extended. Congress is expected to act early in 2015 on a new use of force authorization against ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria.  That debate will focus on how much latitude to give the White House and whether to restrict the use of ground troops as many Democrats want. IRS/Benghazi: Republican-led investigations will continue into whether the IRS unfairly targeted conservative groups and whether the administration covered up its handling of the Benghazi attacks. Democrats complain both investigations are politically motivated and should be ended. Trade/Infrastructure: Republicans will likely advance trade bills that were opposed by many House and Senate Democrats.  New spending for upgrading the nation's roads and bridges in another area where both parties could cobble together a bipartisan vote.   McConnell told CNN in December, ""We have certainly a lot of bipartisan interest in the crumbling infrastructure in the country and what to do about it.""","Republicans are eager to shake off past scandals and seize control of both chambers of Congress .

"(CNN) -- The very best was reserved for last and Usain Bolt did not disappoint. The track and field superstar took the baton on the anchor leg of the sprint relay for Jamaica a stride behind an inspired English quartet before surging clear in the home straight -- the winning time a Commonwealth Games record of 38.58 seconds. Despite being a six-time Olympic champion, it was Bolt's first gold at the Commonwealth Games and he celebrated by prolonged laps of honor of Hampden Park, signing autographs and posing for endless selfies. It was a fitting finale for the athletics program and Bolt had treated the capacity crowd to his usual pre-race antics, cavorting to ""I'm Gonna Be"" by the Proclaimers before switching to race mode as only he can. England's last leg runner Dan Talbot might have dreamed of gold but he could not match Bolt's giant stride and had to settle for a deserved silver ahead of Trinidad and Tobago. Jamaica's women's quartet also won their sprint relay, anchored by the reigning Olympic and world sprint champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce. Like Bolt, she has been having a relatively low-key year ahead of preparing for the 2016 Olympics in Rio, but still showed a neat turn of foot to lead her team home in 41.83 seconds, also a Games record. Nigeria took silver ahead of England. Earlier, 40-year-old mother of two Jo Pavey struck a blow for veteran athletes with a superb bronze in the women's 5,000m for England. Pavey pushed world class Kenyan pair Mercy Cherono and Janet Kiso all the way on a pulsating final lap before finishing a superb third. There was another fairytale story in the men's javelin where Julius Yego of Kenya, famous for perfecting his technique by watching clips on YouTube, took gold with a throw of 83.87 meters. Away from the track and field action, England's Tom Daley dominated the men's 10m platform diving to retain his title in superb style. He put together six fine dives to win by over 82 points. The 20-year-old Daley was one of the poster boys of the London 2012 Olympics, where he took bronze, and his gold was one of the highlights for an England team who have easily topped the medals table at the Games ahead of arch-rivals Australia. The final day of action will see the men's and women's road races in cycling and an eagerly-anticipated New Zealand-Australia clash in the women's netball final. The Games will officially close Sunday evening after 11 days of action.","Usain Bolt anchors Jamaica to gold in 4x100m relay .

"New Delhi, India (CNN)An Ebola survivor has been quarantined in India after his semen tested positive for the virus, health officials there have announced. The 26-year-old man, an Indian national, traveled to New Delhi from Liberia on November 10, almost two months after he was hospitalized in the West African nation after showing symptoms of the illness, India's health ministry said in a statement. He was released from the Liberian hospital on September 30 with documents declaring him free of clinical signs linked to Ebola, the ministry added. As a precautionary measure, Indian authorities carried out tests on his body fluids, which confirmed traces of the virus in his semen, the statement said. ""Currently, this person is not having any symptoms of the disease. However, he would be kept under isolation in the special health facility of (the) Delhi Airport Health Organization, till such time his body fluids test negative and he is found medically fit to be discharged,"" it said. In the wake of the first detection of the deadly virus in India, the country's health minister, J.P. Nadda, held talks with top officials from various departments, the government said. The minister advised strengthening passenger surveillance at the country's airports and seaports, the government said. He also ordered expert teams to visit states and report back to him on preparedness to deal with the virus, it added. India's health ministry, however, urged calm. ""The situation is under control and there is no need for any alarm. However, all precautions are being taken in this regard,"" it said in its statement. According to the ministry and doctors, patients whose blood samples test negative for Ebola after treatment continue to shed the virus in their body fluids, such as urine and semen, for variable periods. A survivor with infected semen can transmit the disease to his sexual partners, they say. ""There is no cure that actually kills the virus,"" explained Naresh Trehan, chairman and managing director of Medanta The Medicity hospital near New Delhi. Patients, he said, are treated with supportive care. Experimental vaccines and treatments for Ebola are under development, but they have not yet been fully tested for safety or effectiveness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Healthcare providers, Trehan emphasized, must adhere to standard safety protocols while attending to Ebola patients and survivors carrying the virus in their body fluids. India has screened thousands of passengers arriving from the Ebola-hit countries since the outbreak of the disease in West Africa. ""This is like a dress-rehearsal for India, and while we are already in the mode of preparation, this case will help us galvanize into action,"" said Hemant Thacker, a consultant physician and cardio-metabolic specialist at Mumbai's Bhatia Hospital. ""I believe we are theoretically prepared because we have learned the lessons from the West. That, however, doesn't mean that our medical authorities become complacent,"" he cautioned.","Man, 26, traveled to India from Liberia on November 10 .

"(CNN) -- On Friday, Kanye West stopped a concert in Sydney to demand that everyone stand up. He looked around the crowd, pointing out those slow to rise. He said, ""Unless you got a handicap pass and you get special parking and s**t,"" he simply would not continue the show until everyone was on their feet. The crowd shouted, ""Stand up!"" or even, ""F***ing stand up!"" After a minute, West pointed out two people who, he said, ""don't want to stand up."" One of them waved a prosthetic leg in the air, so West turned to the last holdout. He demanded to know if the fan was in a wheelchair. The crowd laughed. He complained, ""This is the longest I've had to wait to do a song, it's unbelievable."" Finally, as the crowd was shouting that the fan was in a wheelchair, West sent a bodyguard to verify it, then finally started his song, ""The Good Life."" Reaction to this incident throughout social media and in numerous publications was swift and condemnatory. West, in return, lashed out at the media. But in fact, although West's celebrity magnifies the story, the bigger issue here is that his demand that his fans prove their disability is entirely typical. Every day, in every context, people with disabilities get challenged to prove how disabled they are. This constant questioning isolates people with disabilities, increases stress and shame, and can lead directly to verbal or even physical abuse. Here are a few examples: . A few weeks ago, actor George Takei shared a meme showing a woman standing up from a wheelchair at a grocery store to reach a liquor bottle. The caption, ""There has been a miracle in the alcohol isle,"" suggested that this woman wasn't really that disabled if she could stand up to get some booze. Disability advocates protested and Takei initially told them to lighten up, but he has subsequently apologized. I was alerted to the story by a woman who can walk about 100 feet before needing her chair, and who goes through life worried about being accused of faking. The parking lot, with its handicapped spots, can be particularly fraught for people with invisible disabilities. On my Facebook page, one of my readers remarked that, ""All I see are looks of disapproval, barely veiled disgust and constant scrutiny. I'd gladly trade my 'good' parking space for being able to walk more than 25 yards at a time."" Who knows how many people with invisible disabilities, managing pain, enjoying the concert, were forced to their feet by the glare of Kanye West and the peer pressure of the shouting crowd? Invisible disability also gets people in trouble with the law. When a disabled person doesn't react the way a law enforcement officer thinks he or she should, violence often follows. But visible disability is no protection. In 2008, as shown in a disturbing video, a Florida deputy didn't believe a man who had been arrested on a traffic violation was really a quadriplegic, so she dumped him onto the floor to see if he would use his legs out of duress. These are just a few of the ways we constantly demand that people with disabilities prove themselves. We do it because, to the not-disabled, claiming disability seems to have a kind of power. Thanks to the Americans with Disabilities Act, to claim disability is to ask for reasonable accommodation -- accessible buildings, more time on tests, audible formats for books, Social Security disability payments, and more. Too many people seem to regard the request to accommodate as a burden and meet such requests with suspicion. The not-disabled exercise their privilege by demanding that people prove their disabilities; then, all too often, proof just generates pity, not understanding or inclusion. By demanding everyone rise, by calling out the disabled members of his audience even as he grudgingly tolerated their inability to stand, West was being totally normal. If you think what he did was wrong, remember that the next time you are tempted to stare down someone walking from a handicapped spot at the grocery store. Remember that the next time someone managing pain can't make it into work. Remember that the next time a student needs a little more time on a test. Because the problem isn't that West was so thoughtless, although he was. The problem is that he learned this thoughtlessness from us.","Kanye West insisted audience members stand before he would sing song in Australia concert .

"The day before Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned in May, nearly 25 senators signed a letter calling for him to step down amid a widening scandal over delayed medical care for vets. In the weeks before that, lawmaker after outraged lawmaker rose to denounce systemic problems at the sprawling agency that provides medical and other care to more than 8.5 million veterans. Reports of ""cooked books,"" dying patients on waiting lists, and a warped management culture made headlines. Spearheaded by CNN reporting, the latest news was certainly troubling and upped the stakes in Washington amid a midterm year. It was high drama and members of Congress were in the thick of a political firestorm and some people were even pointing fingers at them. Facing voters in November, they needed to act, and fast. Up went the rhetorical fever, down went Shinseki and in went reform-minded proposals to hire more doctors and nurses and build more medical facilities. The estimated cost -- $35 billion over 10 years. Passage was uncommonly swift and bipartisan in both houses with promises to quickly negotiate a final version. Veterans neglected for years in VA facility, report says . Oddly functional . A Congress infamous for its legislative dysfunction was oddly functional. Vets could get care outside the VA under bill passed by House . ""It's very clear the status quo is not acceptable and it's time for real change,"" House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller said at a recent hearing. While the step was dramatic, serious shortcomings at the VA were nothing new to Washington, including Congress. Complaints of delayed care were well known for years, although not all of the alarming issues raised in the most recent controversy were apparent over that time. Still, investigations were launched, reports written, and hearings held. Congress took some action, but what came about did not fully address historic health care deficiencies at the agency. This all now raises fresh questions about congressional responsibilities for holding agencies accountable. Audit: More than 120,000 veterans waiting or never got care . The role of Congress . Difficulties accessing care ""is something that goes way back as long as I can remember,"" said Rick Weidman, executive director of policy and government affairs at Vietnam Veterans of America. Congress attempted to address a host of issues plaguing the VA in the 1990s. Those reforms improved some functions and the delivery of medical care. But more difficulty in assessing care was an unfortunate consequence of those steps. The VA scrambled to meet a requirement that no veteran wait longer than 30 days for care. The mandate was already demanding for a beleaguered VA, but Congress also required that more veterans and more benefits be covered. Subsequent GAO reports found that the agency was not able to improve health care wait times and the situation actually became worse. Lawmakers also were generous in allocating services for veterans and even gave the VA every dime it asked for. But that didn't seem to help either. Wait times continued to rise. Peter Shuck, Yale Law School professor and author of ""Why Government Fails so Often and How It Can Do Better,"" said Congress could have been more effective. ""(Congress) has failed to exercise effective oversight to require the agency to handle its caseload more efficiently,"" Michael O'Hanlon with the Brookings Institution also said lawmakers could have pushed the agency to modernize its records more quickly and instituted more robust staff reviews. Difficult to oversee . But Miller, who has chaired the veterans committee since 2011 and pressed for the most recent legislation, said the VA has lied ""over and over again,"" making it difficult to oversee. Weidman said the VA has not been forthcoming with the Veterans Affairs Committee over the years, which complains it is still being stonewalled on its requests for information. The past five years have been the ""least transparent the VA has ever been,"" Weidman said. Miller agreed. In a letter to Acting Secretary Sloan Gibson, he accused it of stonewalling or ""have possibly tried to mislead"" Congress. He outlined three instances in which the VA has not provided information to Congress. He is not alone. At least two Democrats have lobbed similar assertions, including Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, accusing the director of the Pacific Islands Health Care System of being ""dishonest"" and lacking competence. Alex Nicholson, legislative director of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, defended Congress. He said oversight committees, especially in the House, have done a good job probing the problems but the VA has been uncooperative. ""You can't know what you don't know,"" Nicholson said. ""When agency gives you false information and lies to you then it's hard to do oversight."" The VA said it is cooperating fully with Miller's panel, which continues to investigate as is the agency's inspector general and the FBI. ""VA respects Congress' important oversight role and is committed to providing timely and accurate information,"" spokeswoman Gina Jackson said in a statement. Acting VA leader: Changes start with getting veterans appointment . Questions about VA finances . Veterans groups also estimate the VA also stumbled on its finances, saying it needed at least 12% more money than it sought over the past five years for medical care. They said the VA did not account for all of the services it provides, especially for veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that it used overly optimistic efficiency projections that did not produce anticipated savings. VA officials would not comment on questions about its budget. But Miller said lack of money is not the problem. ""If money was the solution, then the problems would have been solved a long time ago,"" he said. To its credit, noted by many amid the current uproar, the VA has moved under pressure to reduce the number of homeless veterans and benefit backlogs -- key Shinseki legacies. The practical realities of politics are also to blame for inadequate action. While the Republican-led House has been much more active in passing legislation on a variety of veterans' issues and the Democratic-led Senate has done less, institutional structures is partly to blame. In the House, Republicans can easily pass bills on its agenda despite objection from the minority. Not so in the Senate, where rules give enormous power to individual members to block legislation. And in the overwhelmingly partisan climate, the Senate is where bills go to die, even proposals to help veterans. That happened on a major piece of legislation this past winter. A $20 billion plan to address a host of veterans' issues went nowhere over Republican objections on how to pay for it -- a common GOP stand on federal spending proposals. In light of the latest accusations, however, Congress has acted swiftly, passing VA legislation that includes a series of reforms. But many say it still doesn't go far enough. VA crisis: Solutions exist but haven't happened, panel hears . Veterans groups have provided a series of proposals to immediately address the care backlog, including shifting all trained clinicians into direct provider positions and immediately triage all veterans seeking care. Dr. Robert Jesse, a top official in the VA health administration, acknowledged the need for major changes even beyond what Congress has just done. ""Today we really need to be looking at the entire structure of the organization to move forward. We really need to examine everything,"" he said on Thursday at Miller's hearing. Some conservative and business quarters suggest privatizing medical services or at least opening them up to outside examination of organization and structure. But Weidman said fixing the VA is a lot like an onion -- so many layers. ""And it ain't sweet like a Vidalia,"" he said. FBI launches criminal prove of VA .","Problems plaguing the VA health system have been ongoing for years .
Government reports informed Congress about the depth of problems .

"In two recent studies, researchers at Florida State University explored whether eating disorders are linked to social media use. The answer? Like that most awkward of Facebook statuses says, it's complicated. Summaries in the International Journal of Eating Disorders described the research. In the first study, 960 college women completed a self-reported eating disorder screening assessment. They also answered a series of questions about their Facebook use. A ""small but significant"" positive correlation was found between duration of Facebook use and disordered eating. In the second, 84 women from the first study were divided into two groups. One group was instructed to use Facebook as they typically would for 20 minutes. The other group was told to research the ocelot, a rainforest cat, on Wikipedia and YouTube. Unsurprisingly, the women who spent 20 minutes on Facebook reported greater body dissatisfaction than those who got to look at cute cat photos. The research shows that there is some connection between Facebook use and disordered eating risk. (I don't believe there is anything uniquely problematic about Facebook as compared to other social media platforms; it's just the platform these researchers chose.) But the studies do not suggest that social media platforms should be held responsible for causing eating disorders. After all, we're talking about a wide spectrum of illnesses that have complex biological, psychological and cultural roots. A simplistic blame game would be seriously misguided. We need more research to better understand this connection and, perhaps more important, how social media can be used as a positive tool for outreach, early intervention and recovery. I work with college students every day in my job overseeing the National Eating Disorders Association's youth outreach. For those who struggle with poor body image, perfectionism or anxiety -- just a few of the many risk factors associated with disordered eating -- social media can be downright toxic. Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, Twitter, Pinterest and their many new cousins do provide an unprecedented degree of access to images and messages that can entrench and sometimes trigger disordered eating thoughts and behaviors. Frequent users of social media can end up feeling as though they're alternating between broadcast and comparison modes, which are both dangerous places to be if you are prone to believing that your self-worth is based on others' approval. ""When I look at other people's albums on Facebook, the comparing is automatic. I end up feeling like crap."" This comment came to me from an 18-year-old who participated in a Proud2Bme virtual roundtable on how social media affects teens' body image. It is a sentiment I hear expressed constantly in my work. Back when I was caught up in my own eating disorder as a teen, I used to stare at my thighs in the mirror, wishing they could be as thin as those of models in the pictures I tore out of magazines. There were no hashtags like #thighgap, which have turned appearance-related fixations into searchable universes with neverending streams of photos and ""thinspirational"" text. I wanted desperately to be liked, but there were no ""likes"" or ""hearts"" for me log on to watch and tally. The point is that the obsessions, compulsions and comparisons that drive eating disorders are nothing new. Social media have just amplified them. But it also has the potential to amplify solutions. We need to figure out how we can most effectively use it to promote media literacy, self-acceptance, support, recovery and body image activism. Some might choose to unplug from social media to protect their mental health; there's a reason that most residential eating disorder treatment centers ban social media use  among patients. But the reality is that most people at risk or actively struggling with disordered eating use social media in some way. The good news is that social media give us all the ability to be content curators, media makers and rabble rousers. If you want to fill your feed with messages of body acceptance, you can choose pages and accounts to follow that will deliver those messages. Sure, I still have to report spammy ""belly busting"" advertising, but the content I see and share through social media reflects my values and interests -- and I have no interest in seeing anything related to weight loss or body shaming. Rather than consuming and internalizing media toxicity, we can use social media talk back to a culture that makes us feel like we're never good enough. For example, 19-year-old Benjamin O'Keefe, who is recovering from anorexia, started a Change.org petition reprimanding Abercrombie & Fitch's CEO for comments saying the company was intentionally exclusionary and calling for it to include plus sizes. More than 80,000 people signed his petition, and Abercrombie recently announced that it will carry plus sizes, starting this spring. Just last week was National Eating Disorders Awareness Week. It was the most successful in the organization's history; the #NEDAwareness hashtag had a reach of 23 million during that week, and that social media awareness does translate to an increase in people seeking help. We saw it in the increased volume of calls to the helpline and visits to the website. We saw it in the stories and photos of hope shared on Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram and Facebook. Social media can stoke body dissatisfaction and reinforce disordered eating. It can also empower individuals to use their voices and resist mainstream media messages about beauty and thinness. Let's keep working to understand the nuances of those risks and leverage the benefits to build a movement of change.","New research considers whether Facebook contributes to eating disorders .

"A wildlife operation involving dozens of countries and organizations, seized more than three tons of ivory and a bevy of rare wildlife products as well as rare wood. Operatives found rare animals -- both living and dead -- during the international, month-long operation. The China-led transnational effort, codenamed Cobra II, aimed to crack down on illegal wildlife trade. Authorities recovered over 10,000 live European eels and pig-nosed turtles, as well as over 2,000 live snakes, according to Xinhua, China's state-run news agency. They also seized three tons of ivory, 36 rhino horns, and over 1,000 hides and skins from tigers, leopards and snakes as well as several hundred kilograms of pangolin scales from wildlife traffickers. The operation included 27 other countries including the United States. The effort had the support from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), the World Customs Organization and Interpol, reported Xinhua. During the operation, China's law enforcement officials suspected a Chinese man of being the head of an ivory trafficking group after customs staff at Taoxian Airport in northeast China found luggage containing 1,226 ivory beads, according to Xinhua. Both Chinese and Kenyan police cooperated in the investigation and suspected that the man, whose last name was reported as Xue, operated a crime ring buying, transporting and selling ivory. Xue was arrested in Nairobi, Kenya on January 17 and extradited to China, the news agency reported. His arrest marks the first time China has arrested a wildlife crime suspect overseas, the report said. The Cobra II operation lasted from December 30 to January 26. It will ""serve as a valuable model for the international community in future operations against transnational crimes,"" said Wan Ziming, director of the law enforcement department under the endangered species office in Xinhua. The efforts uncovered over 200 cases with more than 250 suspects, according to Xinhua. China accounts for around 70% of the global demand for ivory, which is known as ""white gold"" in the country. China has been under pressure to take more action to protect rare and endangered species and to fight the illegal trade. China appears to have redoubled efforts tackling the ivory trade -- it destroyed 6.15 tons of ivory in January.","Wildlife operation led by China nets tons of illegal animal products .

"Iran's top cop has offered to quit his job if anyone verifies the results of a recent survey that says 80% of Iranian students drink alcohol and have friendships with the opposite sex, the semi-official Iranian Labour News Agency reported. ""These findings have no basis and if such things are true, I will resign from my post,"" Ahmadi Moghadam said, according to ILNA. Drinking alcohol and relations between men and women who are not related are forbidden in Iran and other conservative Muslim countries. According to ILNA, the survey was conducted by a university professor in Tehran. The report didn't reveal the number of students surveyed or their age range but the study was enough to provoke the police chief's ire. ""The report that 80 percent of males and females have relations goes against the moral fabric of our society,"" ILNA quoted the police chief as saying. Moghadam condemned the media for reporting what he called the bogus results of the study and challenged to debate anyone who believed the findings to be true. ""Those who want to report these statistics want to rattle the public's thoughts."" The police chief said Iran's law enforcement agencies do not interfere with family relations and friendships but they'll step in if laws are broken.

"A federal prosecutor on Monday described a Bosnian immigrant accused of plotting to bomb New York's subway system as an ""al Qaeda terrorist,"" an assertion the defense said was ""just wrong."" An extensive roster of convicted terrorists are lined up to testify against Adis Medunjanin during his trial in New York, which began Monday with opening statements. Prosecutors allege that Medunjanin traveled to Pakistan's tribal belt with two friends, where he sought to join the Taliban but ended up being recruited by al Qaeda to perform a suicide mission back in America. He and two others, they claim, eventually hatched a plan to rig backpacks with explosives and blow them up on New York subway stations. Medunjanin's co-defendants -- Zarein Ahmedzay, an immigrant from Afghanistan, and Najibullah Zazi, an immigrant from Pakistan -- have already pleaded guilty to the same charges. ""In September of 2009, three men were prepared to strap bombs to their bodies and go into crowded subways,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney James Loonam told jurors in his opening statement Monday. ""These men were al Qaeda terrorists,"" Loonam claimed. Angry at the presence of U.S. troops in Afghanistan and Iraq, the three went to Pakistan's tribal belt  --  ""the center of al Qaeda activity against the United States"" -- to join the terrorist group, according to Loonan. Once there, the federal prosecutor said, the men were given ""special treatment"" and ""private training by al Qaeda"" because of their coveted status as U.S. citizens. In his opening statement, defense attorney Robert Gottlieb accused the prosecution of using incendiary rhetoric to inflame the jury. ""These are all words the government knows will scare you beyond belief and shake you to the core,"" Gottlieb said of terms like ""terrorist"" and ""al Qaeda."" ""The truth is Adis Medunjanin is not a terrorist. ... In this case, the government is just wrong."" Later Monday, Ahmedzay took the stand and described how his former high school classmate Medunjanin turned him on to the teaching of radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki.  The American-born Muslim cleric was targeted and killed in a September 2011 drone attack in Yemen. Zazi, who pleaded guilty last year to a plot to detonate explosives in the subway system in September 2009, is expected to testify Tuesday. Medunjanin's trial is expected to last three weeks.","Accused terrorist Adis Medunjanin's trial begins Monday in New York .

"(CNN)My daughter occasionally goes on a hugging and kissing strike. She's 4. Her parents could get a hug or a kiss, but many people who know her cannot, at least right now. And I won't make her. ""I would like you to hug Grandma, but I won't make you do it,"" I told her recently. ""I don't have to?"" she asked, cuddling up to me at bedtime, confirming the facts to be sure. No, she doesn't have to. And just to be clear, there is no passive-aggressive, conditional, manipulative nonsense behind my statement. I mean what I say. She doesn't have to hug or kiss anyone just because I say so, not even me. I will not override my own child's currently strong instincts to back off from touching someone who she chooses not to touch. I figure her body is actually hers, not mine. It doesn't belong to her parents, preschool teacher, dance teacher or soccer coach. While she must treat people with respect, she doesn't have to offer physical affection to please them. And the earlier she learns ownership of herself and responsibility for her body, the better for her. The trial of Jerry Sandusky, the former Penn State football coach accused of sexually abusing young boys, has only strengthened my resolve to teach my kid that it's OK to say no to an adult who lays a hand on her -- even a seemingly friendly hand. Sandusky's comments on child rape allegations . ""When we force children to submit to unwanted affection in order not to offend a relative or hurt a friend's feelings, we teach them that their bodies do not really belong to them because they have to push aside their own feelings about what feels right to them,"" said Irene van der Zande, co-founder and executive director of Kidpower Teenpower Fullpower International, a nonprofit specializing in teaching personal safety and violence prevention. ""This leads to children getting sexually abused, teen girls submitting to sexual behavior so 'he'll like me' and kids enduring bullying because everyone is 'having fun.' "" Protection against predators . Forcing children to touch people when they don't want to leaves them vulnerable to sexual abusers, most of whom are people known to the children they abuse, according to Ursula Wagner, a mental health clinician with the FamilyWorks program at Heartland Alliance in Chicago. None of the child victims of sexual abuse or assault she's counseled was attacked by strangers, she said. Readers react strongly to this article . Sometimes a child picks up on something odd about your brother-in-law that no one knows. It may not be that he's a sexual predator. He may just have no sense of boundaries or tickle too much, which can be torture for a person who doesn't like it. Or he may be a predator. ""It sends a message that there are certain situations [when] it's not up to them what they do with their bodies,"" said Wagner. ""If they are obligated to be affectionate even if they don't want to, it makes them vulnerable to sexual abuse later on."" Why wait until there's trouble? Parenting coach Sharon Silver worked hard to cultivate her children's detector. Silver says her sons easily pick up on subtle clues that suggest something isn't quite right about particular people or situations. In your child's case, it may be that something's off about Aunt Linda or the music teacher down the street. ""It's something inside of you that tells you when something is wrong,"" said Silver. Training your child to pay attention to those instincts may protect him or her in the future. Having sex to please someone else . Would you want your daughter to have sex with her boyfriend simply to make him happy? Parents who justify ordering their children to kiss grandma might say, ""It's different."" No, it's not, according to author Jennifer Lehr, who blogs about her parenting style. Ordering children to kiss or hug an adult they don't want to touch teaches them to use their body to please you or someone else in authority or, really, anyone. ""The message a child gets is that not only is another person's emotional state their responsibility but that they must also sacrifice their own bodies to buoy another's ego or satisfy their desire for love or affection,"" said Lehr. ""Certainly no parent would wish for their teenager or adult child to feel pressure to reciprocate unwanted sexual advances, yet many teach their children at a young age that it's their job to use their bodies to make others happy,"" she said. We can't be rude . You might think my daughter's shiftless parents are not teaching her manners, but that's not true. She will shake your hand in greeting or give you a high-five when we're saying goodbye. She knows how to set the table and place a napkin in her lap. She even has me saying a little all-inclusive blessing she brought home from school. We've trained her to say please and thank you so often that she'll say it back to me when I ask her anything. ""What did you say?"" I sometimes ask her when I didn't hear her. ""Please?"" she'll answer. No, I meant what did she actually say? (Maybe we're overdoing it.) Once a cheater, always a cheater? She has to be polite when greeting people, whether she knows them or not. When family and friends greet us, I give her the option of ""a hug or a high-five."" Since she's been watching adults greet each other with a handshake, she sometimes offers that option. We talk about high-fives so often she's started using them to meet anyone, which can make the start of any social occasion look like a touchdown celebration. ""When kids are really little and shy, parents can start to offer them choices for treating people with respect and care,"" said van der Zande. ""By age 6 or 7, even shy kids can shake somebody's hand or wave or do something to communicate respect and care. Manners -- treating people with respect and care -- is different than demanding physical displays of affection."" It creates more work . Refusing to order her to hand out hugs or kisses on demand means there's more work to keep the relationships going and keep feelings from being hurt. Most of our extended family live far away, so it's my job to teach my kiddo about people she doesn't see on a daily basis. We make sure to keep in contact with calls and Skype and presents. In advance of loved ones' visits, which usually means an all-day plane ride, I talk a lot about how we're related to our guests, what they mean to me and what we're going to do when they arrive. I give them plenty of opportunity to interact with her so she can learn to trust them. I explain to relatives who want to know why we're letting her decide who she touches. And when she does hug them, the joy is palpable. Not from obligation or a direct order from Mom. And while I hope I'm teaching my child how to take care of herself in the future, there are benefits to allowing her to express affection in her own way and on her own timeline. When my child cuddled up to my mother on the sofa recently, happily talking to her about stories and socks and toes and other things, my mother's face lit up. She knew it was real.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) --  -- With six weeks before taking office, President-elect Barack Obama is having one heck of a honeymoon, a new national poll suggests. A new CNN poll gives Barack Obama a 79 percent approval rating in the way he's handling the transition. Nearly eight in 10 Americans questioned in a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey out Tuesday morning are giving the president-elect the thumbs up when it comes to his handling of the transition. Seventy-nine percent approve of Obama's performance so far during transition, with 18 percent disapproving. Obama's approval rating is 14 points higher than the approval rating for President-elect George Bush in 2001 and 17 points higher than President-elect Clinton's rating in 1992, CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. Obama's current approval rating is also more than 50 points higher than President Bush's current approval rating, which now stands at 28 percent --- with 71 percent disapproving of the way Bush is handling his job as president. ""An Obama job approval rating of 79 percent -- that's the sort of rating you see when the public rallies around a leader after a national disaster,"" said Bill Schneider, CNN's senior political analyst. ""To many Americans, the Bush administration was a national disaster."" iReport.com: Dear Mr. President... The poll indicates that 79 percent of the public thinks Obama will do a good job as president -- up 4 percentage points from last month. Eighteen percent think Obama will do a poor job as president, down 3 points from November. And 78 percent of those questioned said they believe Obama will be a uniter -- 20 points higher than those who felt the same way about then President-elect Bush in 2000. Twenty percent say Obama will be a divider, 16 points lower than those who said the same about Bush. ""Bush came in promising to be a uniter, not a divider. That's a promise Bush failed to deliver -- as he himself acknowledged last week in an interview with ABC News when he said that one of his big disappointments is that the tone in Washington got worse rather than better,"" Schneider said. ""Nearly 80 percent describe Obama as a uniter. So far, so good."" Seventy-six percent of those polled have a favorable opinion of Obama. ""And the president-elect is not the only one who is popular right now. Sixty-seven percent have a favorable view of Michelle Obama and 56 percent have a positive view of Vice President-elect Joe Biden,"" added Holland. The Democratic party continues to be much more popular than the GOP. Six in 10 have a favorable view of the Democratic Party, while a majority have an unfavorable opinion of the Republican party. The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted December 1-2, with 1,096 adult Americans interviewed by telephone.

"As it continues to ramp up its efforts for the 2012 election cycle, a national umbrella organization for the tea party movement readily admits its grassroots organizing strategy is borrowed from the left's political playbook. ""Whether they win or lose a campaign, an election, a fight of some kind -- did they come out stronger than they went in?"" is how Brendan Steinhauser, FreedomWorks' director of state and federal campaigns, described the grassroots approach utilized by liberals. Matt Kibbe, FreedomWorks president and CEO, pointed to a strategy that was ""very consistent with all of the left's literature on community organizing."" He attributed a specific phrase that the tea party group has adopted -- ""winning by building and building by winning"" -- to the Sierra Club in the 1990s. ""I stole it from them,"" he said. The strategy was a recurring theme at a recent gathering of roughly 100 conservative activists who came to Washington for a weekend of training hosted by FreedomWorks. Tea party 2.0: Upgraded for 2012 . The event opened up a window into the metamorphosis of the tea party movement -- from mass protests in 2009 into an increasingly sophisticated and coordinated political movement focused on November's elections and beyond. To that end, FreedomWorks shared its ""triple dip"" strategy of focusing on states that will be critical in winning the White House, increasing the Republican majority in the House and flipping control of the Senate into GOP hands. Although the conservative grassroots movement has had some electoral successes, it is not without its critics. Calling them ""wacky,"" Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, recently faulted the uncompromising views of Richard Mourdock, the tea party-backed Republican Senate nominee in Indiana who ousted longtime GOP Sen. Richard Lugar. CNN Contributor David Frum was cautious about the ability of the tea party movement to swing control of the Senate to the GOP. Frum pointed out that the Senate doesn't have highly ideological districts like the House and, therefore, a GOP Senate candidate must balance appeasing conservatives during the GOP primary against the risk of losing the whole state in the general election. Frum called the tea party's decision to back Mourdock and unseat Lugar ""a very high-risk decision"" because it opens up the possibility that Democrat Joe Donnelly could win the Indiana Senate race in November. Kate Zernike, New York Times political reporter and author of ""Boiling Mad: Behind the Lines in Tea Party America,"" observed that while the tea party movement might not have wielded much influence in selecting Mitt Romney as the GOP's presumptive presidential nominee, the conservative grassroots movement has been influential in some Senate races during this election cycle. Tea party groups target Senate after presidential 'disappointments' Specifically, Zernike noted the tea party movement's successful effort to oust Lugar, who many conservatives in Indiana felt was too moderate, and a similarly motivated effort against longtime Utah GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch, who is facing a primary challenge from a tea-party backed candidate. ""If you look at the Indiana Senate race,"" said Zernike, ""they got rid of [Sen.] Richard Lugar and in Texas they've kept the candidacy of Ted Cruz alive ...  and, of course, Orrin Hatch [is] having his fight in Utah."" Texas GOP Senate primary heads to runoff . Zernike says the shift toward more targeted grassroots political activism is a natural outgrowth of the tea party movement's success in the 2010 midterms when dozens of fiscally conservative House members were elected. Kibbe said that when armed with the right tools, the grassroots activists have the power to change the political landscape in the short- and the long-term. ""It's all about this community of people and how connected they are and how many new people they can bring into the system,"" Kibbe told CNN, ""And so every fight we fight -- and it could be a policy fight, it could be building a protest, it could be a book club, it could be a policy seminar, or it could be get-out-the-vote -- all of those things serve two purposes.  One is to accomplish whatever the task is, but the other is to build organization.  And we think that is the key to everything."" Kibbe added that he believes the tea party movement continues, in his view, to exceed expectations because ""you can't see the building of a community.  You can't measure it until it does something."" Kibbe explained how a connected community of activists can get established and then engage in get-out-the-vote efforts. ""You literally just have to feed the machine -- give them yard signs, give them walking maps [to help in knocking on voters' doors], give them whatever it is that they want to do and that trumps all sorts of advantages that the establishment has."" Ohio tea party activist Ed Bell echoed Kibbe. ""Everybody's fully engaged behind the scenes,"" Bell said of the tea party movement's efforts in this key battleground state, ""and the only way you're going to see us is by the fruits of our work."" John B. McAvoy, another Ohio tea party activist, said the movement has gotten away from the big rallies that got so much national media attention. ""Holding up that sign [at a rally] doesn't do a damn bit of good,"" said McAvoy. Instead, McAvoy pulled out his smartphone and declared that ""the weapon of choice for patriots nowadays is this thing."" While Zernike observed that the tea party movement has been smart strategically in focusing on building an organization and targeting races where they can have the most effect and achieve their desired outcome, she also sounded a cautionary note about the movement's future. Zernike pointed out that some establishment Republicans have begun to push back against the influence the grassroots movement is wielding within the GOP; that public favorability ratings for the movement have fallen; and that recent skirmishes over the debt ceiling have put a premium on achieving political compromise in Washington, a practice that is antithetical to the tea party movement. Mourdock was blunt about his dislike for traditional notions of bipartisan compromise. ""What I've said about compromise and bipartisanship is I hope to build a conservative majority so bipartisanship becomes Democrats joining Republicans to roll back the size of government, reduce the bureaucracy and get America moving again,"" Mourdock said last month on CNN. Jeb Bush: Reagan wouldn't fit in today's GOP . Zernike also said that since its genesis in 2009 and successes in the 2010 midterms, the tea party movement is maturing into an established special interest group within the GOP -- into a kind of ""MoveOn.org of the right"" that works to move the GOP in a more conservative direction. Frum suggested a demographic motivation for the conservative grassroots movement -- that rather than being driven by partisanship or ideology, the tea party movement, with its older demographic, is actually acting to protect its interest in federal entitlement programs such as Social Security. As they look toward and beyond this November, the group of activists returned again and again to a model for how the grassroots conservative movement can coordinate to achieve a desired result. Longest-serving GOP senator loses primary fight . After detailing the 18-month campaign to unseat Lugar that was waged by a coalition of dozens of Indiana tea party groups, Greg Fettig of Indiana had a simple message for his fellow activists: ""You unite, you'll change the world.""","FreedomWorks pursuing grassroots strategy that aims to build long-term organization .

"A great crack in America's middle class came to light recently: While our country continues to lead the world as the richest nation, our middle class, once the most affluent in the world, has fallen behind. According to an analysis by The New York Times, Canada's middle class is now the wealthiest, and working families in many countries have seen their incomes rise much faster than those in the United States. The hollowing out of America's middle class has been years in the making, but it wasn't inevitable that working families would fall further and further behind. Instead, it was the direct consequence of deliberate choices Washington has made over the past generation to put the rich and powerful first and to leave working people to pick up whatever crumbs were left behind. It didn't have to be this way. America knows how to build a middle class that is the envy of the world. After the Great Depression, America made two critical decisions. First, it put in place strong rules to level the playing field for families, putting more cops on the beat to monitor financial markets and passing basic safety rules to temper the boom-and-bust financial cycle. Second, the country made building a future for our children the priority. We invested powerfully in our education system, and we made sure that people who worked full time would stay above the poverty line. We built infrastructure -- roads and bridges, our power grids -- so that we had the right foundation for businesses to build jobs here at home. We also invested in basic medical and scientific research, confident that if we built a great pipeline of ideas, our children would have opportunities their parents could only dream about. These steps were aimed at building a strong middle class, and they worked. For a half a century, as the country got richer, our middle class got richer. America built a middle class that promised a bright future to each succeeding generation, a middle class that inched its way toward building opportunities, not just for some of our children, but for all our children. I lived this firsthand, growing up in a country that invested in its children. After my dad had a heart attack, my mom worked a minimum-wage job at Sears -- and that was enough to save our house. I went to a commuter college that cost $50 a semester, and my first husband worked on the moon shot. America was full of promise. About 30 years ago, America began to move in a different direction. Washington took financial cops off the beat by slashing funding of our regulators, letting big banks load up on risk and target families with dangerous credit cards and mortgages. Washington also worked feverishly to cut taxes for those at the top, opening huge loopholes for big corporations and billionaires. Eventually, the loopholes got big enough to drive a truck through.  According to the nonpartisan group Citizens for Tax Justice, by 2008-2012, while the corporate tax rate on paper remained 35%, 26 Fortune 500 companies paid $0 in taxes. That's right -- zero. And how did Washington propose to balance a budget with lower taxes? Stop investing in the future. Instead of supporting college kids who are trying to get an education, the government now uses them as a source of revenue, making billions of dollars in profits off student loans. Investments in roads and bridges have nearly ground to a halt. And government research -- the great pipeline of ideas that led to the creation of the Internet, nanotechnology, GPS and a million medical advances -- has had its legs cut out from under it. Today, the director of the National Institutes of Health says there's only enough money to fund one out of six National Institutes of Health research proposals, and our investments in scientific research don't reflect the values of a nation that plans to lead the world in new discoveries. The impact of these policies has echoed through the economy. Big banks, powerful corporations and billionaires -- people who can afford to hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers -- have amassed more and more wealth.  Meanwhile, the foundations of our once strong middle class have begun to crumble, and families have been caught in a terrible squeeze. Starting in the 1970s, even as workers became more productive, their wages flattened out, while the costs of housing, health care and sending a kid to college, just kept going up and up. In 1980, the minimum wage was at least high enough to keep a working parent with a family of two out of poverty. Now, the minimum wage isn't even enough to keep a fully employed mother and a baby out of poverty -- and on Wednesday, Senate Republicans filibustered a bill to increase the federal minimum wage modestly. We know how to strengthen the middle class in this country because we have done it before. We need a level playing field to make sure everyone follows the rules -- and that breaking the law has the same kinds of consequences for bank CEOs who launder drug money as for kids who get caught with a few ounces of pot. We need to decide that our children -- not our biggest corporations -- are our first priority. We can take on the student loan problem that is crushing our kids, and to rebuild our roads and bridges, upgrade our power grids and expand our investments in basic research. And we can pay for that by putting an end to the tax loopholes and subsidies that go to powerful corporations and the wealthiest Americans. We can repair the cracks in the middle class. We can strengthen our foundations and make sure that all of our children have a fighting chance. But it means changing who Washington works for -- and doesn't.","Elizabeth Warren: U.S. middle class, once richest in world, has fallen behind other nations .

"One person dies every 19 minutes from a prescription drug overdose in the United States. In an effort to combat ""misuse and abuse,"" the Food and Drug Administration is proposing new restrictions that would change regulations for some of the most commonly prescribed narcotic painkillers on the market. The FDA's latest proposal would specifically affect hydrocodone combination pills, also known as opioids, which combine hydrocodone with less potent painkillers such as acetaminophen. One example is the drug Vicodin. Currently labeled as Schedule III drugs, these opioids would, if the reclassification proposal is accepted, be labeled as Schedule II. This means patients would have to have a written prescription from a doctor -- instead of a prescription submitted orally over the phone -- to access the drugs. And refills would be prohibited; patients would have to check in with the doctor to get another prescription. A Schedule II classification would also put manufacturing quotas in place for these hydrocodone products. Pure hydrocodone is already a Schedule II substance. Drugs are categorized into one of five ""schedules"" by the Drug Enforcement Administration based on ""whether they have a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, their relative abuse potential and their likelihood of causing dependence when abused."" Other drugs, such as Adderall and morphine, are also labeled as Schedule II. ""When you wonder why your dentist gives you 40 hydrocodone for a toothache, or your knee doctor prescribes far more than he should, that's because they're under the impression that it's not addictive as Percocet,"" Dr. Andrew Kolodny, president of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, told CNN in January when an FDA advisory panel first urged the administration to recommend tighter restrictions. ""That's completely false."" In an online statement posted Thursday, the FDA said it ""has become increasingly concerned about the abuse and misuse of opioid products, which have sadly reached epidemic proportions in certain parts of the United States."" Approximately 80% of the world's pain pills are consumed in the United States, according to 2011 congressional testimony from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians. Since 1999, sales of prescription painkillers in the United States have quadrupled. So have the number of fatal poisonings from prescription painkillers. Almost twice as many people abuse prescription drugs as the number of people abusing cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens and inhalants combined, the DEA says. Report: States failing to curb prescription abuse . ""Truth is, it is easier for a doctor to write a prescription than to explore other effective options to combat pain,"" CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta wrote in an editorial. ""And it is easier for patients to take those prescription pills than to search for alternatives themselves. Both those things must absolutely change."" The FDA argues it did not come to its decision lightly, saying it conducted a ""thorough and careful analysis of extensive scientific literature, review of hundreds of public comments on the issue, and several public meetings"" in an effort to ensure that future drugs are ""properly prescribed and appropriately used by the patients who need them most."" The FDA's proposal is scheduled to be submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services by early December, but the DEA has the final decision on whether to reclassify the drugs. A spokesman for the DEA told CNN it would be premature to speak about the FDA's recommendation at this time. In September, the FDA took another step to reduce painkiller abuse with new labeling regulations, which are set to go into effect at the end of this year. Currently, the labels on the drugs say they are for ""the relief of moderate to severe pain in patients requiring continuous, around-the-clock opioid treatment for an extended period of time."" The new labels will say the drugs should be used only when ""alternative treatment options are inadequate."" The FDA said it hopes the changes will result in a larger conversation about pain management between patients and doctors.","FDA wants new restrictions on common narcotic painkillers that contain hydrocodone .

"Deadly diseases like Ebola are only a plane ride away. In today's interconnected world, linked by transoceanic flights, one infected person can trigger a domino effect that pays no attention to borders. ""The concern that people are going to get on these flights and fly from West Africa, where these cases are, to anywhere in the world is ... a real possibility,"" said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. ""I think for a long time people didn't think that that was going to happen because Ebola was sort of relegated to very remote areas of Africa. Things have changed with our globalized world."" Could outbreak spread to U.S.? Ebola patient on West African flights . Earlier this month, a Liberian government official who had Ebola symptoms collapsed after getting off his flight in Lagos, Nigeria on July 20. Patrick Sawyer, 40, died five days later. He had been taking care care of his Ebola-stricken sister, in Liberia, although he didn't know she had the disease, his wife told CNN. Health workers identified 59 people who came in contact with him including 15 in the airport staff and 44 from the hospital. He had traveled by plane via Lomé, Togo and Accra, Ghana. His case sparked concerns that the virus could disperse through air travel. At this point, the World Health Organization does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions on Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone. However, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued warnings Thursday to avoid nonessential travel to the three West African countries. The WHO, the International Civil Aviation Organzation and the International Air Transport Association have been coordinating efforts to fight the spread of the disease. According to an ICAO statement, they are considering passenger screenings: ""The Organization remains in contact with the WHO on potential efforts which may be required to facilitate repatriation flights, as well as matters relating to air ambulance services in the affected areas."" Can plane passengers become infected? While the CDC acknowledges it's possible a person infected with Ebola in West Africa could get on a plane and arrive in another country like the United States, the chances of the virus spreading during the journey are low. ""It's very unlikely that they would be able to spread the disease to fellow passengers,"" said Stephen Monroe, deputy director of CDC's National Center for Emerging Zoonotic and Infectious Diseases. ""The Ebola virus spreads through direct contact with the blood, secretions, or other body fluids of ill people, and indirect contact -- for example with needles and other things that may be contaminated with these fluids."" He added that most people who have become infected with Ebola lived with or cared for an ill patient. ""This is not an airborne transmission,"" said Dr. Marty Cetron, director of CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine. ""There needs to be direct contact frequently with body fluids or blood."" Travelers should take precautions by avoiding areas experiencing outbreaks and avoid contact with Ebola patients. Ebola symptoms include fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat; followed by vomiting, diarrhea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and at advanced stage, both internal and external bleeding, according to the WHO. ""It is highly unlikely that someone suffering such symptoms would feel well enough to travel,"" IATA said in a statement. ""In the rare event that a person infected with the Ebola virus was unknowingly transported by air, WHO advises that the risks to other passengers are low. Nonetheless, WHO does advise public health authorities to carry out contact tracing in such instances."" This means determining who had contact with the affected person. What should flight crew do if Ebola infection is suspected? The CDC issued interim guidance for airline crews on Ebola virus infections. ""As with many other global infectious disease outbreaks, airline carriers, crew members, airports can be very important partners in that front line,"" said Cetron. ""Being educated, knowing the symptoms, recognizing what to do, having a response protocol, knowing who to call, those are really, really important parts of the global containment strategy to deal with threats like this."" The CDC advises that when flight crew members encounter a passenger with symptoms that they suspect could be Ebola, such as fever and bleeding, that they keep the sick person away from other passengers. They've been instructed to wear disposable gloves and to provide the sickened person with a surgical mask to prevent fluids from spreading through talking, sneezing or coughing. The airline cleaning crew are also instructed to wear disposable gloves, wipe down surfaces including armrests, seat backs, trays and light switches. The CDC says that packages and cargo should not pose a risk, unless the items have been soiled with blood or bodily fluids. When someone becomes ill on a flight, the captain is required by aviation regulations to report the suspected case to air traffic control, according to IATA. How it's affecting flights . Nigeria-based airline companies ASKY and Arik Air suspended operations at the end of July into Monrovia and Freetown, the capitals of Liberia and Sierra Leone, respectively. ASKY said passengers departing from Conakry, Guinea, would be screened for signs of the virus. Most of the international flights from Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia have flights to other West African destinations like Senegal, Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire. There are several flights a week to Belgium, France and the United Kingdom too, according to data from Flightstats.com. Passengers could get anywhere through connecting flights. The UK Department of Health said in a statement that it is monitoring Ebola, but that the risk is still low for British citizens. ""We do not, at the moment, think this is an issue that affects the UK directly,"" said Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who held a high-level meeting about the disease on Wednesday.","CDC: Spreading Ebola on a plane is ""very unlikely""

"RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (CNN) -- The presidents of France and Brazil are set to sign several bilateral agreements, including a defense accord that would make Brazil the first Latin American nation to possess a nuclear-powered submarine. French President Nicolas Sarkozy, left, and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva meet Monday. According to Brazil's official news agency Agencia Brasil, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva are scheduled to sign a strategic cooperation agreement Monday during the Brazil-European Union summit in Rio de Janeiro. Sarkozy is the president of the European Union Council. Brazil and Argentina are the only Latin American countries with significant nuclear capabilities. The agreement would include the transfer of technology that would allow Brazil to assemble 50 EC-725 Cougar helicopters, four conventional submarines and one submarine with nuclear capability as part of Brazil's military modernization process, officials told Agencia Brasil. Under the accords to be signed by the two presidents, France also would provide Brazil with night vision and remote monitoring technology to be used by the military in the Amazon region, the news agency said.","Conventional submarines, helicopters also included in defense deal .

"NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell will work with four women ""on the development and implementation of the league's policies, resources and outreach on issues of domestic violence and sexual assault,"" according to a memo Goodell sent to the league's teams Monday. The memo comes after a tumultuous week for the NFL. With Ray Rice suspended indefinitely for hitting his then-fiancee in an elevator, the league saw three more of its players come under scrutiny over domestic violence or child abuse allegations. Two of those players were deactivated for their Sunday games. Fourteen players have been arrested for violence against women in the last two years, a Sports Illustrated article last week reported. The women tapped to help craft league policy are: . • Anna Isaacson, the league's vice president of community affairs and philanthropy; she will now be vice president of social responsibility; . • Lisa Friel, former head of the sex crimes prosecution unit in the New York County District Attorney's Office; . • Jane Randel, the co-founder of NO MORE, which aims to ""raise the profile of and normalize the conversation about domestic violence and sexual assault""; . • Rita Smith, the former executive director of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. ""We are continuing to develop our organization to strengthen our ability to address the wide range of issues we face and other changes in our office will be announced soon,"" Goodell wrote in his memo. ""Our goal is to make a real difference on these and other issues. We know that we will be judged by our actions and their effectiveness."" The assistant executive director of external affairs for the players' union commended the commissioner. ""Anything that we can do as an NFL community that will be effective to raising awareness on this serious issue is a good thing,"" said George Atallah of the NFL Players Association. Rice is expected to appeal his indefinite suspension before Tuesday night's deadline but Atallah said that is not a sign that the union condones domestic violence. ""It's not mutually exclusive for a union to be disturbed by the actions of one of our members, but also vehemently protect our collective bargaining rights,"" he said. ""If the union believes that Ray Rice's due process rights were violated, then we have an obligation to appeal his indefinite suspension."" The president of the NFL Players Association, Eric Winston, told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" it might be wise to bring in outside help for the league to make disciplinary decisions. ""Obviously, there's an issue with player conduct ... and maybe it's time to take that out of the commissioner's hands and put it into a neutral arbitration process, where there can be a fair process for everybody involved,"" said Winston, a free agent who played last season with the Arizona Cardinals. Two other players were kept off the field Sunday for their alleged behavior. Adrian Peterson was deactivated after an East Texas grand jury indicted him on a child abuse charge. Peterson's lawyer has said his client is innocent, and the Minnesota Vikings' owners announced that Peterson will return to practice this week and is scheduled to play Sunday. The Carolina Panthers' Greg Hardy was scheduled to play Sunday but was deactivated shortly before game time following an outcry over his domestic violence case. Authorities say Hardy choked his then-girlfriend, threw her around, dragged her by her hair and threatened to kill her. He was sentenced in July to 18 months of probation and a 60-day suspended sentence after a bench trial; he has appealed that ruling and a jury trial is scheduled for November. Ray McDonald was allowed to play in the San Francisco 49ers' Sunday night game against the Chicago Bears, but California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom has asked the team to suspend McDonald after his arrest on domestic violence charges last month. Police were called to a birthday party at McDonald's home on August 31 and determined McDonald had been involved in an altercation with his fiancee, who was 10 weeks pregnant, The Sacramento Bee reported. At a press conference Monday, Carolina Panthers head coach Ron Rivera said the discussions on Hardy have been internal and that there have been no outside consultants. Rivera would not say whether Hardy would be on the active roster Sunday night against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Hardy played in week one against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers but was deactivated for Sunday's game against the Detroit Lions. ""The decision made yesterday was made based on the information that was gathered, things that we looked at and talked about and then it was made in the best interests of this football team,"" Rivera said. Rivera referenced ""some of the things that changed in the climate"" as to why Hardy did not play Sunday. ""We're going to have to look at things and look at what's going on,"" Rivera said. ""We're going to have to get a feel for some things. And as I said, (general manager Dave Gettleman) and the guys upstairs are going to do their due diligence in terms of looking at what our options are.""

"It's been seven years since ""Team Aniston"" and ""Team Jolie"" T-shirts were flying off the shelves. Now, with rings on their fingers, it seems both women have moved on, yet the saga continues. Many people are referencing Brangelina in the wake of Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux's engagement. And if countless headlines like, ""Anything Brad can do! As Pitt set to wed Angelina Jolie, ex-wife Jennifer Aniston announces her engagement..."" are any indication, the media has no intention of giving up on the love triangle. Even CNN commenters have taken sides, perpetuating a fictitious (we imagine) rivalry between the actresses. Opinion: We care that Aniston's getting married. Why? ""Brad so traded down ... Congrats Jenn & Justin I hope you all beat the odds and live happily ever after,"" commenter Wilder Napalm wrote. Some commenters' well wishes were masked by unkind words for Jolie: ""She's the underdog! we always root for the underdog. Brad Pitt left her for a puffy lipped bomb shell! She got dumped! plus the entire world talked about it.. So you Go Jen!"" james648 wrote. Aniston has also received her fair share of flak: ""Something must be wrong with her, Brad dropped her like a bad habit."" So why continue picking sides? ""We like to take sides on everything,"" said Fraser Ross, who owns Kitson, a boutique that sold Team Aniston and Team Jolie shirts back in 2005. ""The thing with Jen is that she was in peoples' living rooms for (10) years. ... People felt like they were one of her friends ... whereas Angelina wasn't in our living rooms."" That might be why Team Aniston shirts sold faster than Team Jolie shirts, Ross said, adding, ""It was 25 to one at the beginning."" But don't feel bad for Jolie just yet. Her fans have since shown support by purchasing ""Adopt Me Angelina"" paraphernalia. ""My guess is that most people on Team Jolie would not be focusing on the fact that Brad Pitt left Jennifer Aniston for her,"" said James C. Kaufman, a professor of psychology at California State University at San Bernardino and editor of the APA journal of Psychology of Popular Media Culture. ""They're more seeing Jolie as this strong independent single woman who is both happily (engaged) and successful in her career and doing all this stuff with the travel and the charity and these generally positive things."" ""Team Aniston,"" Kaufman added, ""more identifies with the girl next-door side who has been screwed over by her man."" Even though both women are engaged, Ross said he doesn't anticipate any ""Mrs. Pitt"" or ""Mrs. Theroux"" T-shirts. ""We don't want to dig up the past,"" he said. Some CNN commenters, like Kkkkatie, echoed his sentiment: ""I don't condone cheaters (if that is what happened with Brad and Angelina, who REALLY knows) but what I do know is that life is too short to stay in an unhappy marriage. I think it's absurd that the public want to paint Jen as this 'wronged' woman for the rest of her life. My God folks, lets just move on and let it go!""

"He was a beefy 5-foot-10 but won an Oscar for playing the slight, 5-foot-3 Truman Capote. He had the booming voice of a deity but often played schlubs and conflicted characters. He could be heartfelt and giving, as with his male nurse in ""Magnolia"" or rock critic in ""Almost Famous,"" or creepily Machiavellian, such as the gamemaster in the latest ""Hunger Games"" movie. Philip Seymour Hoffman was an actor who could be anybody. ""I don't know how he does it,"" director Mike Nichols told The New York Times Magazine in 2008. Nichols directed Hoffman on both stage (""The Seagull,"" ""Death of a Salesman"") and screen (""Charlie Wilson's War""). ""Again and again, he can truly become someone I've not seen before but can still instantly recognize. ... He may look like Phil, but there's something different in his eyes. And that means he's reconstituted himself from within, willfully rearranging his molecules to become another human being."" ""Philip Seymour Hoffman's precise, uncanny performance as Capote doesn't imitate the author so much as channel him, as a man whose peculiarities mask great intelligence and deep wounds,"" wrote Roger Ebert about 2005's ""Capote."" Hoffman was found dead Sunday. Reports attribute his death to a drug overdose. For years, Hoffman was the kind of anonymous character actor who earned critical raves but was often unnoticed by the general public. He had an Everyman face -- burly enough to be an athlete, soft enough to be an artist, with an eye twinkle that could be either vicious (as in his ""Mission: Impossible III"" villain) or humorous (the frat-boyish Sandy in ""Along Came Polly""). Consider the roles that earned him Academy Award nominations: a conniving writer (""Capote""), a cranky CIA desk jockey (""Charlie Wilson's War""), an upbeat, dissembling priest (""Doubt"") and a charming, enigmatic cult leader (""The Master""). Or consider the ones that didn't: baseball manager Art Howe (""Moneyball""), suspicious Freddie Miles (""The Talented Mr. Ripley""), clever Plutarch Heavensbee (""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire""). The New York Times' Ben Brantley, who saw him on stage, was unequivocal. ""One of the finest actors of his generation,"" he wrote in his review of the 2012 staging of ""Death of a Salesman"" -- even while finding Hoffman miscast in that production. One of a kind everyman: . He's of a type harder to find in Hollywood these days, where movie-star looks and charisma often take precedence over the ability to disappear into a role. Indeed, even when movie stars do try to disappear, we're all too aware of the tricks, whether it's weight gain, a putty nose or an unfamiliar accent. Movie stars sell tickets. Character actors -- and Hoffman, for all his intensity, was a character actor -- support movie stars. That seemed OK with him. You could more often find him in challenging roles or secondary parts than leads. He liked to take chances. He worked with director Paul Thomas Anderson (""Boogie Nights,"" ""Magnolia,"" ""The Master"") before either was a big name, and Anderson provided him with a steady stream of interesting roles. He took small parts in such films as the dark comedy ""Strangers with Candy,"" based on the unpleasant characters dreamed up by Amy Sedaris, Paul Dinello and Stephen Colbert, and ""The Invention of Lying,"" Ricky Gervais' comedy about religion and atheism. In some respects he followed the path of one of his heroes, Paul Newman, who had looks and magnetism to burn but wasn't shy about taking ""character"" parts, such as a broken-down lawyer in ""The Verdict"" or a ne'er-do-well in ""Nobody's Fool."" The latter featured Newman acting opposite Hoffman, as did the HBO miniseries ""Empire Falls."" He also kept his talent sharp with frequent stage work and the kind of ""one for me, one for them"" movie philosophy that made sure he was both busy and successful. The price of fame: . In recent years, he'd become a more recognizable face -- and persona. In a video that quickly made the rounds, his voice was dubbed into a trailer for the Joaquin Phoenix movie ""Her,"" taking the place of Scarlett Johansson's operating system, Samantha. Where Johansson is relaxed, Hoffman is intense; where Johansson is helpful, Hoffman is wily. It neatly summed up his capabilities. But with fame comes intrusion, and Hoffman seemed uncomfortable with the attention. He was a New York-based actor, not a movie star. It was a job, not an excuse to turn him into an open book. ""Somebody wanted me to talk about my personal life,"" he told the UK newspaper The Independent in 2012. ""I'd rather not because my family doesn't have any choice. If I talk about them in the press, I'm giving them no choice. So I choose not to."" His death has left his colleagues in shock. ""We have lost a true artist,"" said Robin Wright in a statement. Wright worked with Hoffman in ""Moneyball"" and the forthcoming ""A Most Wanted Man."" ""He was a giant talent,"" said Tom Hanks, who co-starred with Hoffman in ""Charlie Wilson's War."" But perhaps director Nichols was most succinct -- and heartfelt -- in describing the void left by Hoffman's death. ""No words for this,"" he said in a statement. ""He was too great and we're too shattered."" ""Great"" is an all-too-appropriate word, as Hoffman himself used it when expressing his goals. Given his work and the circumstances of his death, a line from the 2008 New York Times Magazine profile seems more haunting today. ""For me, acting is torturous, and it's torturous because you know it's a beautiful thing,"" he said. ""I was young once, and I said, 'That's beautiful and I want that.' Wanting it is easy, but trying to be great -- well, that's absolutely torturous.""","Philip Seymour Hoffman was a rare breed in Hollywood .

"A promising way to stop a deadly disease, or an uncomfortable step toward what one leading ethicist called eugenics? U.S. health officials are weighing whether to approve trials of a pioneering in vitro fertilization technique using DNA from three people in an attempt to prevent illnesses like muscular dystrophy and respiratory problems. The proposed treatment would allow a woman to have a baby without passing on diseases of the mitochondria, the ""powerhouses"" that drive cells. The procedure is ""not without its risks, but it's treating a disease,"" medical ethicist Art Caplan told CNN's ""New Day"" on Wednesday. Preventing a disease that can be passed down for generations would be ethical ""as long as it proves to be safe,"" he said. ""These little embryos, these are people born with a disease, they can't make power. You're giving them a new battery. That's a therapy. I think that's a humane ethical thing to do,"" said Caplan, the director of medical ethics at New York University's Langone Medical Center. ""Where we get into the sticky part is, what if you get past transplanting batteries and start to say, 'While we're at it, why don't we make you taller, stronger, faster or smarter?' "" But Susan Solomon, the director of the New York Stem Cell Foundation, said there are no changes to existing genes involved. ""There is no genetic engineering. It isn't a slippery slope. It's a way to allow these families to have healthy children,"" said Solomon, whose organization developed the technique along with Columbia University researchers. ""What we're doing is, without at all changing the DNA of the mother, just allowing it to grow in an environment that isn't sick,"" she added. A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel concluded two days of hearings into the procedure Wednesday. The panel discussed what controls might be used in trials, how a developing embryo might be monitored during those tests and who should oversee the trials, but no decisions were made at the end of the session. Mitochondrial disorders are inherited from the mother. In the procedure under discussion in Washington, genetic material from the nucleus of a mother's egg or an embryo gets transferred to a donor egg or embryo that's had its nuclear DNA removed. The real reason behind the multiples baby boom . The new embryo will contain nuclear DNA from the intended father and mother, as well as healthy mitochondrial DNA from the donor embryo -- effectively creating a ""three-parent"" baby. In June, Britain took a step toward becoming the first country to allow the technique. One in 6,500 babies in the United Kingdom is born with a mitochondrial disorder, which can lead to serious health issues such as heart and liver disease. Caplan said the same technology could be used to modify an embryo to ""making super babies,"" a practice he said amounted to ""eugenics."" ""The big issue over the next 5 to 10 years is going to become how far do we go in pursuit of the perfect baby,"" said Caplan. ""Do I think we're going down that road? Yes. Does it creep me out? Yes. Are you going to be able to draw a clear line? I don't think so."" But Solomon said the procedure is closer to an expansion of in vitro fertilization, which has been available for nearly 40 years. ""It's a complicated science, so people need to understand the particulars of the biology and not jump to calling it something it isn't,"" she said. The last thing she would want, she said, ""is for the New York Stem Cell Foundation to be involved in anything like designer babies."" ""I have children and grandchildren, and I can't imagine anything worse."" Record number of women using IVF to get pregnant .","A 3-person embryo could circumvent mitochondrial diseases .

"(CNN) -- As many as 225,000 children in Haiti live and work as unpaid domestic servants, the first study to closely examine the issue concluded. The existence of these arrangements are not new, but the scope is larger than previously thought, a new study by the Pan American Development Foundation found. The foundation conducted the largest field survey of human rights violations in Haiti. Known as restaveks, these extremely poor children are sent by their families to other homes. ""In principle, parental placement of a restavek child involves turning over child-rearing responsibility to another household in exchange for the child's unpaid domestic service,"" the study says. The majority, two-thirds, of restaveks are female, and all are prone to abuse and rape by their host families, the study says. The movement of the children is from poor homes to less poor homes, sometimes within the same family. In addition to boarding, families often send their children to become restaveks because of schooling opportunities in their new homes. To determine how widespread this practice is, the foundation conducted 1,458 door-to-door surveys in some of the more troubled neighborhoods in Haiti, the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere. According to the U.N. Office for the Special Envoy for Haiti, unemployment reaches 70 percent nationally and 78 percent of Haitians live on less than $2 a day. Given the dire economic condition, child trafficking and organized violence has been a problem in Haiti. The study's aim was to answer the question: ""What is the scale of the victimization?"" What researchers found was that 22 percent of children surveyed were living away from home, and that 30 percent of households had restavek children. Using census projections for 2010, the study extrapolated that as many as 225,000 children in Haiti's urban areas could be living as restaveks. The recruitment of such children is ""intimately linked"" with poverty, said the study, which recommended that the government and foreign aid be used in poverty alleviation programs and more widely available education services, especially in rural areas. The placement of restavek children has traditionally been a movement from rural Haiti to urban areas. Another key find to the study is that they are increasingly coming from other urban areas, the study found. In many cases, children are placed in homes of relatives, but kinship ties did not guarantee better treatment, according to the study.","Study: As many as 225,000 children in Haiti live and work as unpaid domestic servants .

"Two days after snow began to fall -- and a day after many Georgians, including hundreds of schoolchildren, finally made it home -- the state's governor apologized Thursday for what many saw as an insufficient and ineffective response. Gov. Nathan Deal told reporters he was ""not satisfied"" with how his state dealt with the 2.6 inches of snow plus the sheets of ice that it turned into, leading to massive gridlock throughout metro Atlanta. In addition to students stranded at school, many drivers camped out in their cars or abandoned them by the hundreds along thoroughfares big and small. ""I accept responsibility for the fact that we did not make preparation early enough to avoid these consequences,"" Deal said. ""... I'm not looking for a scapegoat. I'm the governor, the buck stops with me."" Speaking later Thursday with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Deal said ""we all made errors in judgment"" and that ""the major lesson is we have to be more proactive."" According to the governor, that means taking action like declaring a state of emergency earlier on -- even if it ends up being a false alarm, relatively -- and making sure the resources are available to deal with such a crisis. ""Apologies are something that don't change the circumstances,"" said the governor, a Republican running for re-election in November. ""What we intend to do is change the circumstances."" Winter now taking a kinder approach . Mother Nature has helped thaw some of the snow, slush and ice in northern Georgia, thanks to sunny skies and temperatures that crept above freezing. Yet while the major interstates are largely clear, the danger is hardly over. The National Weather Service's forecast calls for nighttime temperatures in the mid-teens through much of the region. That means the threat of yet more ice, especially on untreated roads. To that point, while a few area school districts such as Gwinnett and Walton counties are vowing to reopen, most in the area will remain closed because of still-hazardous conditions, especially on secondary roads. One man who lives on such a road is Ed Diefenbach. The 50-year-old said Thursday afternoon that no one had treated his tree-lined road on the city of Atlanta's northern outskirts, along which there are hundreds of homes. Instead, drivers are crawling past remaining icy patches. Diefenbach, who posted pictures to CNN iReport, recalled how a friend retrieved his hungry 10-year-old son from school Tuesday night because buses couldn't move while he had to ditch his car up the street. He said he's concerned not only about the road now, but how authorities -- whatever their comments to date -- will respond to the next crisis. ""The mayor (Kasim Reed) was very defensive and so was the governor,"" Diefenbach said of both public officials' earlier comments. ""... It's just a lot of frustration."" Georgia emergency official under fire . At Thursday's news conference, the director of the Georgia Emergency Management Agency acknowledged having made ""a terrible error in judgment"" in not opening the emergency operations center six hours earlier than he did. Charley English said he first talked to the governor about how serious the situation was becoming, particularly around metro Atlanta, as the forecast shifted at 9 or 9:30 a.m. Tuesday. This was some six hours after meteorologists upgraded to a winter storm warning. ""I got this one wrong,"" he said. ""I made the decision not to do anything until later that morning."" He said that next time out when forecasts change, GEMA and the state team it coordinates will respond more aggressively. Asked whether he planned to resign, English said, ""That's not my call."" Deal was noncommittal about English's future, saying it was too early to talk about firing anybody. But the governor did say that during Tuesday morning, ""we were told that further action was not necessary."" To that point, in an e-mail exchange with Deal's chief of staff, English affirmed Monday afternoon that he would have alerted the governor's staff ""if the weather was going to be bad,"" but he didn't believe that was the case then. The e-mails were first reported by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and later obtained by CNN. In another e-mail between the two around 4:15 p.m. Tuesday, the emergency management director acknowledged the huge challenge  -- how to treat slick roads when they were covered by so many slow-moving or stalled vehicles. ""I don't see how we are going to get rid of the ice with such low temps predicted,"" English wrote. ""Too many cars out there now to make a lot of progress."" Reed cited the mass exodus from his city as largely responsible for the resulting gridlock. The mayor admitted a ""lack of experience""  in dealing with ""severe weather events"" in Atlanta also played a role. ""We made an error in the way that we released our citizens,"" the mayor told NBC's ""Today,"" claiming that the situation might have gone more smoothly if schools, then private businesses, then government offices released people in that order. ""I think it would have made a major difference."" Katrina vet: 'I think they failed' Whether such explanations or promises of change will assuage the legions of critics remains to be seen. The crisis dragged on far longer than many would have liked. It was not until Wednesday evening -- more than a day after the snowfall began -- that Deal announced that all of metropolitan Atlanta's schoolchildren had gotten home. Some chided officials for learning little from a 2011 ice storm that paralyzed the region for a week, because no one could safely get anywhere. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist, Mike Luckovich, depicted Deal and Reed responding to the snowfall by making snow angels. In fact, as the snow picked up midday Tuesday, those two officials were together at a ceremony honoring the Atlanta mayor. ""I think they failed,"" retired Lt. Gen. Russel Honore, who led the recovery efforts after Hurricane Katrina on the Gulf Coast, said of the official response. ""... Admit it, fix it and be ready for next week."" The anger was pervasive, among locals such as Diefenbach and travelers such as Greg Shrader, a truck driver from Maine who gave up after sitting in traffic for 27 hours for what should have been a three and a half hour trip. ""I have never been failed by officials like I have here. Still no equipment, no well-being check. No plan,"" Shrader told CNN on Wednesday. ""I guess they're waiting for it to melt."" R. David Paulson, a former director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, understands the challenges that officials face as they weigh how to react -- and risk overreacting -- when bad weather approaches. Taking steps such as opening up shelters, evacuating people and urging businesses to shutter is costly, but so are the consequences of not acting. ""That costs a lot of money,"" said Paulson, now a consultant. ""But how much is a life worth?"" Deaths and new life . Those who won't be forking over money include motorists who abandoned their cars in Georgia cities such as Atlanta and Roswell, where authorities have vowed that vehicles will be towed free of charge. The towing of the remaining abandoned cars was expected to begin around 9 p.m. Thursday. Some people in the area have been able to rescue their vehicles sooner. Many of them showed up still sleep-deprived and seething at two locations Thursday to get chauffeured to their vehicles by members of the National Guard in four-wheel-drive vehicles. Deal has extended the state of emergency through Sunday night ""to assure that all necessary resources are available for state agencies and local governments to clear roads and all other winter storm-related obstacles."" Yet it's not just Georgia that's dealing with the storm's aftermath. Parts of Alabama were still digging out on Thursday, with the Shelby County Sheriff's Office declaring in the morning that many roads there were ""still impassible (and) closed to regular traffic."" ""Civilian vehicles cannot safely travel due to icing and impede the travel of emergency vehicles responding to calls,"" the office said on Facebook, before reporting hints of progress later in the day. Highway patrolmen in North Carolina and Mississippi both responded to some 600 calls apiece from motorists who'd either crashed or abandoned their cars after the weather hit. Throughout the Southeast, the icy weather was blamed for 10 deaths -- five of them in Alabama and the others in North Carolina and Mississippi. But there were also plenty of signs of hope and life amid the madness and mess. Take the story of Amy Anderson, who was stuck in her car with her husband when she went into labor. As a police officer looked on, Anderson gave birth to a daughter, whom she and her husband, Nick, named Grace. ""When we gave her the name Grace, it just fully explained the whole situation,"" the new mother told CNN's Piers Morgan on Wednesday. ""Just by the grace of God that we all came out healthy."" There were also lifesavers, like the manager of a Kroger supermarket in Roswell who opened the store's doors and fed about 80 people, according to CNN affiliate WSB. ""I don't consider myself a hero,"" the manager Bren Sexton said, deflecting praise from those who called him just that. ""It was just second nature. It's what we would do for anybody who needs help/"" Then there's Dr. Zenko Hrynkiw, a Birmingham, Alabama, neurosurgeon. As falling snow brought things to a standstill on Tuesday, Hrynkiw trekked over 6 miles in scrubs, a jacket and slip-on shoes from one hospital to another for an emergency brain surgery. The patient had only a 10% of living given the size and nature of his brain hemorrhage, according to Hrynkiw. But he did make it, said the surgeon: ""(We) battled a demon there for a while and it all worked out OK."" Hrynkiw said he's been at work for days, though he hasn't been alone as other medical personnel have also stuck it out. ""Everyone is doing the same thing,"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Thursday. ""Everyone is pitching in, the nurses are staying overnight. You've got to do what you've got to do.""","""I don't see how we are going to get rid of the ice,"" emergency official admitted .

He extends state of emergency through Sunday night to free up needed resources .

"Before the mysterious disappearance of one of its passenger jets this month, Malaysia wasn't a country used to finding itself dominating headlines around the world. Some of its Southeast Asian neighbors, including Indonesia and the Philippines, have suffered devastating natural disasters in recent years and are all too familiar with the media frenzy that accompanies a major crisis. But Malaysia has largely managed to stay out of the international spotlight since its independence from British colonial rule more than half a century ago. ""It is one of these countries, because of its geography, that doesn't have earthquakes,"" said Ernest Bower, senior adviser for Southeast Asia studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""It doesn't have tsunamis. It hasn't been tested with a disaster like this."" The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has thrust the government into the dazzling glare of worldwide attention. And it hasn't emerged with very good grades. ""I think on a stress test, they're failing,"" Bower told CNN's Jake Tapper, pointing to the government's coordination of different agencies and communication with other countries. China among critics . Criticism and complaints have come from other countries involved in the search for the missing plane, including China and Vietnam, and from the relatives of passengers. Malaysian officials have created confusion by issuing contradictory statements on key aspects of the investigation. The majority of the people on board the plane were Chinese, and Beijing has increasingly voiced its displeasure with the search, especially after Malaysia announced over the weekend that evidence suggested the plane had been deliberately flown west into the Indian Ocean, away from its last confirmed location over the South China Sea. ""The new information means the intensive search in the South China Sea for the whole past week was worthless and would never bear fruit,"" said a commentary published by China's state-run news agency Xinhua. ""Even worse, the golden time for saving possible survivors, if any, was generously wasted."" ""It is widely asked why the Malaysian government failed to provide such crucial information as early as possible to avoid futile search by around a dozen countries,"" the commentary said. China's Foreign Ministry urged Malaysia to keep providing more ""thorough and correct information."" Chinese family members of the missing plane's passengers have been especially vocal, including some who loudly, emotionally demanded answers Wednesday outside the room where Malaysian authorities have been briefing reporters. ""We have been here for 10 days and (gotten) no single piece of information,"" one woman who identified herself as the mother of one passengers told a horde of reporters. ""... I just don't know where the plane has gone to. We are not satisfied with the Malaysian government's inaction."" Malaysian officials have defended their handling of the crisis, stressing that the situation is unprecedented. ""This is not a normal investigation,"" Hishammuddin Hussein, the country's acting defense and transport minister, said last week. The shock of scrutiny . But some analysts say the missteps are symptomatic of a governing elite that's grown increasingly aloof. ""Although theoretically a democracy with regular, contested elections, Malaysia has been ruled since independence by the same governing coalition that has become known for its lack of transparency and disinterest—even outright hostility—toward the press and inquiring citizens,"" Joshua Kurlantzick, senior fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in an article for Bloomberg Businessweek. That resistance to scrutiny has come to haunt Malaysian government officials. ""It's not surprising. The Malaysian government has been able to live on its own terms for a very, very long time,"" said Clive Kessler, a professor at the University of New South Wales in Sydney who specializes in Malaysian studies. The governing Barisan Nasional coalition and its predecessor have been in power for more than five decades. Prime Minister Najib Razak, the son and nephew of former prime ministers, has been in office since 2009. Najib maintained a conspicuously low profile during the first week of the plane's disappearance. He appeared before the news media over the weekend to announce that the government believed the plane had flown off course as the result of deliberate actions. But he refused to take questions from journalists. Some critics say that, in this instance, Malaysia can't afford to be insular and assume it has all the answers. The scope of this crisis -- and the fact Malaysia doesn't have much experience in this regard -- begs for more international outreach, not shutting out others who can help, they say. U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel raised the issue of ""transparency"" in a phone call Monday night with Hishammuddin, with two U.S. officials saying that Hagel made this point to emphasize the need to share information given the complexity of this investigation and search. ""He was saying the best way to handle this is to continue to be transparent and tell what you know, when you know it,"" one official said of Hagel's intent. Decades of dominance . Malaysia is an Islamic state with a Muslim majority. But it's also a multiethnic country with a wealth of varying opinions, experts say, including from within different ethnic and religious groups. Ethnic Malays enjoy government preferences for positions due to their status as ""sons of the soil,"" or Bumiputera, a term that comes from the Sanskrit word ""bhumiputra"" -- ""bhumi"" can mean land or earth, and ""putra"" means son. ""They have historically enjoyed political dominance,"" said Donald K. Emmerson, the director of the Southeast Asia Forum at Stanford University. But the governing coalition's grip on power isn't as strong as it used to be. In elections last year, it failed to secure more than half of the popular vote, its worst ever performance. It kept its majority in parliament in part thanks to voting district boundaries that favored its candidates. The government is finding itself increasingly fragile, analysts say, and the popularity of social media has undermined the clout of state-run news organizations. ""It's starting to open up,"" said Bower. ""Social media has opened it up, a growing middle class has opened it up."" Tensions with opposition . Human rights activists say the repeated prosecution of opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim on sodomy charges is evidence of the lengths the Malaysian government will go to in order to sideline its opponents. After being acquitted of the charges in 2012 after a lengthy legal battle, Anwar was found guilty again this month when a court overturned the previous verdict. The decision prevented Anwar from entering the race for important regional elections. ""The trial and conviction of Anwar should be seen for what it is: an underhanded move by the ruling party to tarnish and weaken the political opposition without regard to the harm caused to the nation's judiciary and democratic process,"" said Graeme Reid, director of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Rights Program at Human Rights Watch. The government has repeatedly denied that the case against Anwar is politically motivated. To shore up support, Najib's government has become increasingly reliant on a populist, religiously conservative approach that caters to ethnic Malays in rural areas, said Kessler, who has studied Malaysian society and culture for about 50 years. The government's approach has fueled increasing disillusionment among other ethnic groups, notably the Chinese, and urban dwellers, he said. Against that backdrop, dissatisfaction over the handling of the search for the missing plane could be a moment of truth for the government, according to Kessler. ""It may well be that Malaysia will not be the same after this because it has only served to exacerbate all the tensions in Malaysian society between the government and many of the people it rules over,"" he said.

"As Egypt's generals warned of potential chaos, thousands of civilians jammed Tahrir Square late Friday, eager to learn results of last week's runoff election and see the country move away from military rule. The nation's election commission delayed the release of the results Thursday to an unknown date, feeding speculation over whether Ahmed Shafik or Mohamed Morsi will prevail. There were conflicting reports on the website of the semiofficial news site Ahram Online. Shafik, the last prime minister under former Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak, will be named the country's new president Sunday, Ahram  reported on its English version Friday, citing several unnamed government sources. Shafik will be declared victor with 50.7% of the vote, the news outlet said. But the site's Arabic version quoted election commission officials as saying Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood candidate, remained in the lead. There's been no official confirmation from the leadership in Cairo. Both Shafik and Morsi have claimed they've won the election. An electoral official said authorities are reviewing about 400 electoral violation reports submitted by the two candidates. Earlier Friday, Egypt's military rulers said they won't reverse their widely deplored constitutional and judicial changes and warned politicians to keep a lid on election-related unrest. ""We will face anyone who will pose a challenge to the public and private sectors with an iron fist,"" the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces said. The country's constitutional court dissolved the lower house of parliament last week, extending the military's power and sparking accusations of a coup. The military council recently announced it had full legislative authority. The Muslim Brotherhood, the country's largest Islamist group, was the dominant party in the parliament. Under an interim constitutional declaration, the military council retains the power to make laws and budget decisions until a new constitution is written and a new parliament elected. The declaration said Supreme Council members ""shall decide all matters related to military affairs, including the appointment of its leaders."" The president has the power to declare war, it says, but only ""after the approval"" of the Supreme Council. In its statement, read on state TV by a military official, the Supreme Council said the judiciary is a pillar of Egyptian society. ""All decrees issued by the judiciary system must be respected and implemented because they represent the people. It will be considered a crime if anyone objects to the ruling or attempts to block its implementation,"" the military said. It said the constitutional declaration was a ""necessity that the current situation posed in administrating the affairs of the nation during the critical current phase of our nation's history. Whatever is issued from SCAF is based on the high interests of the nation, nothing else."" The military council said it does not favor one political entity over another and respects everyone's ""rights for peaceful demonstrations that keep in consideration the high interests of the nation."" And it stresses the importance of self-restraint and respect for authority. It said announcements of unofficial presidential results are ""inexcusable"" and sow political divisions. Both candidates have claimed victory in the runoff. The Supreme Council urged political entities to respect democracy and ""abstain from all possible acts that may descend the country into a full chaos."" Mubarak ruled Egypt with an iron hand and as a staunch ally of the United States, which gives the nation $1.3 billion a year in military aid. Egyptian reform leader Mohamed ElBaradei -- the former head of U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency and the winner of a Nobel Peace Prize -- said he's been in close contact with the military council and the intelligence services on the one hand and Morsi on the other and has urged them to avoid a showdown. He said that if Shafik, seen as a candidate of the pro-Mubarak old guard, is declared the winner, ""we are in for a lot of instability and violence ... a major uprising."" He isn't as worried about a Morsi victory because Shafik supporters are unlikely to take their anger to the streets, he said. He described the current situation as ""a total, complete 100 percent mess."" Muslim Brotherhood lawmakers met with political leaders to discuss plans for a coalition to fight what they believe is a power grab by the military, according to the Facebook page of its Freedom and Justice Party. ""We will NOT accept this coup against democracy,"" it said, adding that ""together, we will march on to complete the revolution."" More than 800 people died and 6,000 were wounded during the uprising that ended Mubarak's 29-year rule in February 2011. Mubarak and his former interior minister, Habib al-Adly, this month were convicted of ordering security forces to kill anti-government protesters and were given life terms. But other top aides -- as well as Mubarak's two sons, who had been tried on corruption charges -- were acquitted.","Speculation increases on who won presidential runoff .

"The Obama administration on Tuesday lost a Supreme Court fight over property rights that centered on a series of federally controlled and managed floods that caused major timber damage along an Arkansas river. The 8-0 ruling concluded that the periodic release of water from a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dam project begun two decades ago was a government ""taking."" The legal designation would require the federal government to pay the state for damages. ""Removing temporary flooding from Taking Clause inspection would be out of sync with our recognition that, as a rule, temporary takings may be compensable,"" said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. ""Why should courts differentiate flooding from the myriad other instances of government occupation or invasion of property?"" The dispute is narrow and unique in many ways, but could clarify the standards for determining the scope, length of time, and impact of government actions affecting many property owners -- private and public. At issue for the high court was whether the resulting downstream flooding was effectively ""permanent"" and therefore a ""taking,"" or was merely ""temporary"" and only a ""trespass."" The state of Arkansas owned the flooded land and had earlier won a $5.6 million judgment. During oral arguments in October, several on the bench expressed support for the state. ""You knew when you opened up the dam that this is where the water was going to go,"" Chief Justice John Roberts said to a federal government lawyer. ""Your position seems to be that if it's downstream, somehow it's not the government's water,"" said Justice Anthony Kennedy. ""It's like the old moral refuge that the rocket designers take: I only make the rockets go up; where they come down is not my concern."" The Army completed the Clearwater Dam in 1948, along the Black River in southeastern Missouri, in response to prior natural flooding. About 110 miles downstream, in northeastern Arkansas, is the Dave Donaldson Wildlife Management Area. It is 23,000 acres of state-owned riparian land used for duck and game hunting, wildlife management, and timber harvesting. Federal rules for decades had managed normal release of the water, and provided for both ""planned"" and ""unplanned minor deviations."" Beginning in 1993 the Corps launched a series of planned, irregular quick releases of water during the summer growing season in part to give upstream farmers more time to harvest their crops without their fields becoming inundated. Under the unique dynamics of stream flow and hydraulics, the result was higher water levels downstream, and long-term flooding of the state property during the critical growing period. The series of deviations lasted until 2000. The Constitution's Fifth Amendment forbids ""private property be taken for public use without just compensation."" Even thought the land in question is state property, all sides have treated the land as ""private"" in nature for purposes of settling the ""takings"" dispute. Justice Elena Kagan sat out the Arkansas appeal since she had litigated the case in some form during her previous job as the administration's solicitor general. The case decided Tuesday is Arkansas Game & Fish Commission v. U.S. (11-597).","Arkansas case centered on a series of federally controlled and managed floods .

"Washington (CNN) -- The executive board of the International Monetary Fund approved Wednesday the cancellation of Haiti's $268 million debt to the fund. The board also approved a three-year request by authorities to support Haiti's reconstruction and growth program. The decisions are part of an effort to support Haiti's longer-term reconstruction plans after the January 12 earthquake, which killed more than 220,000 people, destroyed 60 percent of government infrastructure and left more than 180,000 homes uninhabitable. Six months later, more than 1.5 million remain in overcrowded displacement camps. ""The new program provides a strong and forward-looking framework to support economic stability and reconstruction in the country, and will also help catalyze donors' contributions,"" the IMF said in a posting on its website. The debt relief is expected to help Haiti meet balance-of-payments needs worsened by the earthquake. ""Improving the business environment and fostering private credit and investment will be essential to support growth,"" said Charles Castel, governor of the Bank of the Republic of Haiti. ""The fund's technical assistance will help rebuild economic institutions and build capacity."" The earthquake resulted in losses estimated at 120 percent of 2009 GDP, the posting said. It struck at a time when the impoverished country's outlook was improving. Last year, Haiti's growth reached almost 3 percent, the second-fastest rate in the Western Hemisphere. Since the quake, a fragile recovery has been taking place. Agricultural production, construction and textile manufacturing are supporting economic activity, the posting said. And remittances, which grew by 12 percent between January and May of 2010 over the previous year, are supporting consumption and imports. Though the trade deficit is widening, exports are recovering, it said. GDP is projected to expand by 9 percent in fiscal year 2011-12, due mostly to reconstruction activity, and by 6 percent by 2015. Inflation is expected to reach 8.5 percent during the current fiscal year and to drop to 7 percent by 2013. In March, the international community pledged $9.9 billion to Haiti's reconstruction, of which $5.3 billion is to be disbursed over the coming 18 months. But last week, a CNN investigation found that most governments that had promised money to the special fund had not delivered the cash. Less than 2 percent of the $5.3 billion promised had been handed over to the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission. Only four countries had paid anything at all to the commission: Brazil, Norway, Estonia and Australia. The United States has pledged $1.15 billion but had paid nothing, with the money tied up in the congressional appropriations process. Venezuela has promised even more -- $1.32 billion. It too had paid nothing, though it had written off some of Haiti's debt. Still, many governments and aid agencies have given money to Haiti through means other than the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission. For example, the U.S. State Department said it has given about $675 million through the U.S. Agency for International Development. Altogether, about $506 million had been disbursed to Haiti since the donors' conference in March, said Jehane Sedky of the U.N. Development Program. CNN compiled the information by reviewing commission figures and surveying the donors that had made pledges. No countries told CNN they do not plan to deliver the money eventually. The pledges are for fiscal year 2010-2011, so the donors have until the middle of next year to get the funds to the Haiti recovery commission, Sedky said.","IMF cancels Haiti's debt to the fund .

"When Max Wallack was 6, his great-grandmother Gertrude Finkelstein -- Great Grams as he called her -- was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. His parents were open with him, explaining in easy-to-understand terms that the illness would have a significant impact on her memory. Wallack and his great-grandmother had always been close, but the debilitating disease took its toll on their relationship. She had cared for him when he was young; now he was one of her primary caregivers. Wallack spent a large part his childhood watching over Great Grams, who was in and out of nursing homes until she moved in with his family. Despite his age, Wallack often held the responsibility of taking care of his great-grandmother alone when his parents could not. He called it ""bubby-sitting."" Alzheimer's affects 5.2 million Americans and millions more who are caregivers devoting their lives to helping affected loved ones. Caring for someone with Alzheimer's is no simple task. Symptoms include memory loss, difficulty in performing everyday tasks and not recognizing close family members. ""There were some hard times,"" says Wallack, now 17. He recalls a vacation to Hawaii when Great Grams grew fearful of the family, even though they were only looking out for her. Young caregivers put life on hold . Great Grams passed away when Wallack was 10. Her last few years inspired him to devote his life to studying Alzheimer's and dementia. Wallack is a junior studying neuroscience at Boston University. After graduation, he wants to attend medical school and continue pursuing Alzheimer's research. His resume already showcases his passion: He performs research at the Laboratory of Molecular Psychiatry in Aging at Boston University's Alzheimer's Disease Center. He also founded the nonprofit organization Puzzles to Remember, which distributes puzzles to patients in nursing homes with Alzheimer's and dementia. Wallack did not achieve all this without persistence -- or intelligence. He took university courses while still in high school and began lab work when he was 15. Wallack's ultimate goal? To find a cure or treatment for Alzheimer's. But attacking the illness from a medical standpoint alone is not his only course of action. ""You have to combat it in many different ways,"" he says. He decided to focus part of his advocacy on an experience with which he was very familiar: being a young caregiver for someone with Alzheimer's. The 10 warning signs of Alzheimer's . This summer, Wallack released a children's book, ""Why Did Grandma Put Her Underwear in the Refrigerator?"" The title is meant to be funny, but Wallack says children who have loved ones with Alzheimer's will relate to the serious side as well. The book aims to teach children about Alzheimer's. While Wallack's parents were open with him when they explained Alzheimer's, others tiptoe around the topic to avoid scaring children, he says. By providing ways to cope, relatable experiences and even a bit of humor, the book aims to make this conversation easier. Wallack wrote the book with the help of Carolyn Given, his English teacher from fourth through eighth grades. When he reached out to Given last winter, he had already been planning the book for years. ""I would love to help him out,"" Given recalls saying. ""As soon as I said that -- within a week -- he had his entire manuscript."" The two have crafted a lighthearted, educational book that made it to the Amazon Top 100 Best-Sellers for Large Print shortly after its release. The book is filled with stories and ways to help children learn about Alzheimer's -- some from Wallack's childhood as well as others from children he has met. One part describes how a person with Alzheimer's might be afraid of a pet cat because it looks like a lion. Another part teaches children about serving food to people with Alzheimer's on red plates -- a proven caregiving strategy that makes food stand out on plates, causing them to eat more. Families from all over have reached out to thank Wallack for sharing this story, praising it for quelling children's fears about Alzheimer's. ""This is the kind of reaction I had hoped for,"" Wallack told CNN in an e-mail. ""I find stories like that very fulfilling.""

"What kind of weapon can shoot down a fully loaded passenger jet flying at nearly 33,000 feet? That could be a key question in the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crash investigation, as officials try to determine what was responsible for Thursday's plane crash in volatile eastern Ukraine. A radar system saw a surface-to-air missile system turn on and track an aircraft right before the plane went down, a senior U.S. official told CNN's Barbara Starr. And a second system saw a heat signature at the time the airliner was hit. The United States is analyzing the trajectory of the missile to pinpoint where the attack came from, the official said. Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry, said in a Facebook post that ""terrorists"" fired on the plane operating a Buk surface-to-air missile system. A Ukrainian official also told CNN's Jim Sciutto on Thursday that separatists claimed to have brought down another plane around the same time Flight 17 went missing. But what could have shot down the Malaysia Airlines flight? Shoulder-fired missiles sometimes in the arsenals of rebel and separatists groups would be ruled out, experts said. ""At normal cruising altitude a civilian passenger aircraft would be out of the range of the sort of manned portable air (defense) systems that we have seen proliferate in rebel hands in east Ukraine,"" IHS Jane's Defence Weekly's Nick de Larrinaga said in an e-mail. Such shoulder-mounted weapons at best can reach 15,000 feet, said CNN military analyst Rick Francona, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel. ""This would indicate a surface-to-air missile or an air-to-air missile, and I think a surface-to-air missile is probably the best guess right now,"" he said. One candidate is the Buk missile system, developed during the Soviet era and operated by Russian and Ukrainian forces. The missile system, known as the SA-11 among NATO forces, is operated by both Russian and Ukrainian forces, according to retired Brig. Gen. Kevin Ryan, director of the Defense and Intelligence Project at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University. And it's more than capable of taking down an airliner flying at that altitude, he said. Such weapons travel with Russian troops at the division level, Francona said. ""So the Russians on the other side of the Ukrainian border will have all of this weaponry available to them,"" he said. Other possibilities include Russian-made S-200 missiles that are operated by the Ukrainian military as well as the Russian S-300 and S-400 missiles. The latter weapons are the Russian equivalent of U.S. Patriot missile defense batteries. What seems unlikely is that pro-Russia separatists might have gained control of such a sophisticated piece of weaponry and used it to shoot down an airliner, Ryan said. ""It takes a lot of training and a lot of coordination to fire one of these and hit something,"" he said. Typically, a surface-to-air battery missile  consists of a command post vehicle, a radar vehicle, several self-propelled launchers, loader vehicles and even more vehicles to carry new missiles to the batteries as necessary, according to Dan Wasserbly, Americas editor for IHS Jane's. Ryan concludes then that if the plane really was shot down, a professional military force -- either on purpose or by accident -- was responsible. ""This is not the kind of weapon a couple of guys are going to pull out of a garage and fire,"" he said.","Senior U.S. official: Radar saw surface-to-air missile system track aircraft .
A sophisticated surface-to-air missile was more likely used, experts say .
One possibility is the Russian-made Buk missile system, retired Army officer says .

"""We have just shot down a plane. ... A plume of smoke is visible."" The biggest clue so far into who may have shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 might be what Ukrainian officials say are intercepted communications between pro-Russian rebels operating in eastern Ukraine. The recordings, translated and distributed by Ukrainian officials, begin with an alleged militant informing others that a plane has been shot down. The communication picks up later, once the alleged rebels reach the scene of the crash. Here's a segment of a conversation between an alleged pro-Russian rebel named Major and another identified as Grek, per Ukrainian authorities: . Major: The plane broke into pieces in the air ... we have found the first 200 (dead). It's a civilian."" Grek: ""How are things going there?"" M: ""Well, we are 100% sure that it was a civilian plane."" G: ""Are there a lot of people?"" M: ""F--k! The debris was falling straight into the yards."" M: ""Here are remnants of internal brackets, chairs, bodies."" G: ""Are there any weapons?"" M: ""Nothing at all. Civilian belongings, medical scraps, towels, toilet paper."" Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk on Friday blasted the ""terrorists"" he blamed for shooting down the plane a day earlier, with 298 people aboard. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the phone call, and it is not known if the recordings were edited or when they were made. But Lt. Col. Rick Francona, a CNN military analyst, said he would not be surprised if Ukrainians were able to monitor the communications of the rebels. ""Ukrainian intelligence, they're pretty good in their own territory,"" he said Friday on CNN's ""New Day."" In a final segment of the alleged intercepted phone calls, an unidentified militant allegedly speaks with a Russian Cossack, Mykola Kozitsyn. Militant: ""On TV, they say like it is a Ukrainian An-26, a transport plane. But the writing says 'Malaysia Airlines.' What was it doing over the territory of Ukraine?"" Kozitsyn: ""Well then it was bringing spies. Why the hell were they flying? This is war going on."" While these recordings have garnered worldwide attention, they are not the first alleged intercepted calls that Ukrainian officials have released. Others were released earlier this month. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin told CNN on Friday that the phone calls were intercepted at the same time that the plane was shot down. Yatsenyuk called for international support ""to bring to justice all these bastards who committed this international crime."" Russia has not directly responded to the content of the audio, but President Vladimir Putin has blamed Ukraine for the crash. ""This tragedy would not have happened if there had been peace on that land, or in any case, if military operations in southeastern Ukraine had not been renewed,"" he said. An additional set of recordings released by Ukrainian intelligence officials Friday is said to link the rebels to the time that the missile allegedly took down the plane. One recording, purportedly between the military chief of the separatist Lugansk National Republic and a Russian military intelligence officer, discusses the missile system, called a Buk. The alleged rebel is heard telling the supposed Russian officer that they hold the Buk. ""Yes, I know that,"" the Russian officer responds. In a separate audio, another alleged Russian military intelligence officer and another rebel military chief discuss where to unload and hide the Buk.

"At 7:35 a.m. in Southern California, children who've brushed their teeth, combed their hair and stuffed their wheeled backpacks rub their eyes awake and shuffle onto the street. They gather at the intersection of Agnes Road and 35th Street in Manhattan Beach for the school bus. But this school bus doesn't carry the kids.  The kids carry it. By its handles, the children hoist a yellow bus-shaped sign that reads, ""Walking School Bus."" The other students wave triangular orange flags to warn cars to slow down.  They walk along the street and stop at another designated spot to pick up more kids at the ""bus stop.""  Adult supervisors follow them for the half-mile walk to the elementary schools. All of them are exercising and they hardly know it. Walking to school is the practice of a bygone era and it's also a small piece of an extensive project to bring simple, healthy changes to a grand scale. Three Southern California cities, Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach, are undergoing a three-year health makeover under a program designed by Dan Buettner, an author and explorer. His mission is to ""make the active option, the easy option."" Buettner's program called Healthways Blue Zones Vitality City aims to make the healthy choice, the convenient choice by changing an entire community's environment. He's  devising ways to change that environment by making it harder to find junk food, more convenient to get physical activity and easier to adopt healthy habits. The changes don't ask for ""marathon and diets,"" Buettner said.  It's small changes that add up, such as bike lanes, better pedestrian access, encouraging personal interactions and walking to school. Jennifer Agliozzo, a mom who coordinates the walking bus for Grandview Elementary School, said the walks have become more popular in just two weeks.  When they walk to school, ""people come out and wave like we're a parade,"" she said. ""It's nice to get cars off the street and the traffic,"" she said.  ""It's also nice meeting other parents."" The simple act of walking to school ""engineers three to five miles a week, so you don't have to worry about gym class and you get people moving,"" said Buettner whose project finds the best practices in healthy communities to apply to U.S. cities. As Americans grow bigger and unhealthier, Buettner, an author of books about longevity and happiness, doesn't chalk it up to people being dumber or lazier. The blame for the obesity crisis cannot fall squarely on the shoulders of personal responsibility -- there's a bigger factor, he posits. It's the environment, he said Thursday at TEDMED, a conference discussing innovations in health.  ""We are all part of a system. We need to address the system."" ""You can't rent a movie, fill up on gas without running through the gauntlet of junk food that can pound you all day long,"" he said.  ""When you go to a Little League game, you can't go without seeing parents bring the pop and cookies.  You can't get away from empty calories."" There is a degree of personal responsibility, but ""discipline is a muscle that fatigues,"" he said. The three neighboring California beach cities were chosen among 50 to undergo the health makeover under the project called Vitality City. A major criterion was that the local government and schools had to be on board. Bike paths are planned.  The mayor of Manhattan Beach hosts public hours in form of walking meetings with his constituents. A local food chain, Good Stuff, offers calorie counts and nutritional facts including fat, carbohydrates and protein in its menu. The employees of the local Crowne Plaza Hotel organized a walking group with 70 members. At Body Glove, a water sports brand, managers got rid of the candy and chips  in the office and replaced them with sliced fruit. The businesses that have signed on to the Vitality City's effort receive free pedometers and free smoking cessation classes. Andrea Soto, an employee at a call center called AAMCOM in Redondo Beach, said health issues at work also should be addressed. At the call center, workers sit in cubicles, staring into the computer screen and answering calls from stranded people using Los Angeles County highway call boxes. On a busy morning, there is hardly any movement, only the hum of conversations and typing. When Soto came to work at the call center six years ago, she gained 50 pounds. ""When we get here, we gain weight.  We were sitting down the whole eight hours. During breaks, we were sitting down.  When we weren't sitting down at the call center, we were sitting down in the break room,"" she said. The company decided to get involved with the Vitality City. Every week, the office gets free lunch -- but the only rule is that it has to be healthy.  The workers usually prefer Subway sandwiches. The owner started filling a bowl in the break room with apples, pears and bananas.  The employees also share an office bicycle for those who want to bike rather than drive to lunch. If small efforts like this means that workers ""eat fewer calories, have less stress in the workplace, then all of this helps the overall emotional and physical well-being of the business,"" said the owner, Steve Diels. It's more expensive to lose workers to sick days than to provide healthy snacks, he said. Since the efforts began, one employee has lost 20 pounds, and another has lost 12. About 75 employers, including aerospace company Northrop Grumman, the public school systems and municipalities, have signed up for the beach cities' efforts . The efforts that started in Southern California this year are based on the same principles of the pilot project helmed by Buettner in 2008 in Albert Lea, Minnesota, a city of 18,000. In Albert Lea, they banned junk food snacking in schools, started walking school buses, organized community-walking groups and identified the most socially influential people to spread healthy habits.   The three-year project ended with an average weight loss of about three pounds, extended life expectancy of three years and a 40% drop in health care costs for the city. Buettner hopes to translate Albert Lea's results to bigger cities. So they arrived to the three California cities. They found that the local governments and schools supported their efforts.  Plus the funding came from Healthways, a well-being company and the Beach Cities Health District, a preventive health agency. A Gallup poll of the three cities of 1,300 people found that 60% of the population was overweight or obese.  Forty-six percent reported significant stress and their anger level was at 16%, which was on par with Detroit, Michigan, according to the poll. ""What has changed is the environment,"" said Buettner of the recent rise in obesity issues.  ""The price of calories, we've engineered physical education out of our lives.  We're good people but we need to think of health in a different way."" In the early 2000s, Buettner, on assignment for National Geographic, sought to find longevity hotspots.  After spending five years, he wrote a book identifying five cities where people enjoyed longer and healthier lives.  The five are Sardinia, Italy; Okinawa, Japan; Loma Linda, California; Ikaria, Greece; and Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica. He and his team distilled the reasons why these communities were successful.  People there had social and community networks (the in-person type, not Facebook), had daily purposes in their lives.  And they did not seek out exercise, because their daily routines were ""landmined with opportunity"" for physical activity, Buettner said. To incorporate those lessons, the cities' program includes walking moais -- essentially a social group that walks together based on common interests and schedules.  There are 150 of them exercising through the three beach cities. Irv Brand, 83, and his wife, Joan Edelmann of Redondo Beach, are the leaders of one of these walking groups. Before joining the walking group, they never exercised. Now they walk 12 miles a week. ""Walking alone at a health club is boring,"" said Brand.  ""It's more fun to walk with a group.  If we don't feel like walking, we go anyway because the group expects us to be there. ""It's better than trying to do it on our own.""","Three beach cities in California are attempting to change their health outcomes .

"NATO forces in Afghanistan will no longer use airstrikes against insurgent targets in civilian homes if ""other means"" to deal with the targets are available, a spokesman said Monday. Forces ""will continue to conduct operations against insurgents who use civilian dwellings, but when there is concern over the presence of civilians; air delivered munitions will not be employed while other means are available,"" Lt. Col. Jimmie Cummings said. The statement did not elaborate on what other means commanders would use. The shift comes after an airstrike last week in Logar province that killed 18 people, including women and children. It was the latest of several such strikes that have upset relations between Afghanistan and the United States. NATO forces said the strike occurred when soldiers returned fire during a mission targeting a Taliban leader. An ISAF spokesman said insurgents were killed and security forces seized weapons and explosives. Afghan President Hamid Karzai cut short a trip to China following the strike and summomed the commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, Gen. John Allen, to demand an end to the strikes. ""The President said that such kind of operations were against the context of the strategic partnership agreement and Afghanistan wants them to be stopped,"" the president's office said in a statement Saturday. The change in policy will not hinder forces from pursuing insurgents, Cummings said. ""This restriction in no way limits our ability to take the fight to the enemy,"" he said. ""Air dropped munitions against civilian dwellings represent a very small percentage of all of our air operations."" In the last six months, 10 of the 3,000 fixed-wing close air support missions flown by NATO involved strikes against civilian dwellings, Cummings said. Seven of those strikes resulted in civilian casualties, he said.","NATO to restrict airstrikes against civilian homes .

"(CNN) -- Dr. Maria Siemionow, head of plastic surgery at the famed Cleveland Clinic, led a surgical team that recently performed the first face transplant in the United States. Cleveland Clinic doctors spent 22 hours reconstructing a patient's face. Siemionow and CNN chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta talked with CNN's Larry King about the reconstructive procedure and the prognosis for the patient. The following is an edited transcript of the interview. Larry King: Dr. Siemionow, what caused the patient to need a new face? Dr. Maria Siemionow: The patient has a severe deformity of the face after trauma and was missing a nose and missing cheekbones and a large part of the skin and the front of the face, upper lip, lower eyelids. There was a large part of the skin and bone components which were missing, and practically the patient was missing the front of the face.  Watch a discussion of the transplant procedure » . King: Did you have to find the perfect donor? Siemionow: No. That's not what were looking for. We were looking for a possibility of reconstructing this patient's face in a way that it would replace the missing components and that we would be able, also, to give back this patient's function, which is probably the most important idea behind this procedure.  Interactive: Learn more about the procedure » . King: So what was the transplant? Siemionow: Well, the transplant was the transfer of the transplanted face, which included (a) large amount -- about 80 percent of the entire face of the patient. It included skin components, bone components, the entire nose, cheekbones, a palette and upper lip and also included the eyelids -- the lower eyelids.  Watch Siemionow discuss the procedure » . King: From another doctor's standpoint, Dr. Gupta -- and I know that you're not a plastic surgeon, but a brain surgeon -- what was the most amazing thing about this to you? Sanjay Gupta: The face is one of the most complicated areas of the body. I mean, it's responsible for your facial expression, your ability to eat, your ability to breathe, your ability to speak, obviously. Being able to take all those really, really functional areas that are made up of so many nerves, so many blood vessels -- not to mention the cosmetic aspects of it -- and making it all come together and work in some sort of functional form is pretty remarkable. King: Doctor, has the patient seen her new face? Siemionow: No, the patient has not seen her face, but she touched her face, and she was very happy. She, for the first time a few days ago, just went with her fingers over her face. She felt that she has a nose. She was feeling her lip, and she was very happy. King: How long did it take (to do the surgery)? Siemionow: It took 22 hours -- 22 hours of many team members of different subspecialties working together, from one afternoon one day into the late afternoon the second day. Gupta: It strikes me that you found the perfect recipient, someone who's a good candidate for this operation. Four years, though, it took, Dr. Siemionow. Is that how rare this type of procedure will be? Siemionow: Yes. Well, you know, we discussed it very extensively, that you want to be sure that in our approach we were looking only at potential candidates who would be a patient who had already exhausted all conventional means of reconstruction. I think it's very important because you would like to be sure that the patient is not undergoing such a serious procedure without being helped in conventional means before. However, it is very difficult to reconstruct certain parts of the face, including, for example, lips or including eyelids. Even reconstruction of the entire nose is difficult. There are plastic surgeons who are doing wonderful reconstructive procedures, but they are also done in several attempts. This takes time and patients suffering and the results not always are presentable.","Doctor who performed first U.S. face transplant says patient recently felt new nose, lip .

"Girl Power was a first-time topic for our Sunday trip around the ""Inside Politics"" table, along with some key things -- and people -- to watch for as we leave 2014 behind and brace for 2015 and 2016. CNN's John King and other top political reporters empty out their notebooks each Sunday on ""Inside Politics"" to reveal five things that will be in the headlines in the days, weeks and months ahead. 1.     An Obama briefing room strategy that may be popular at home -- and with Hillary Clinton . President Obama had a busy Friday -- delaying his Hawaii vacation so he could hold his year-end news conference and sit down for a farewell interview with CNN's Candy Crowley. So might the wife and kids be a little peeved that their Christmas break got off to a later start? Not so fast, says Bloomberg's Margaret Talev. At that press conference, the president called only on women reporters, and Talev suggests there might be a benefit -- or benefits -- for the commander in chief. ""Some may have just been goodwill to appease Michelle and the girls before he embarks on several rounds of golf in Hawaii, but there are a couple other things at play,"" said Talev. ""Some of this is about his own legacy, but a lot is about gearing up for 2016. The women's vote is going to be essential for Hillary Clinton (Republicans are trying to work on that as well). And you're seeing him set up that fight going into the new year."" 2. Clintons are ""going crazy"" because they think Warren's gearing up for a run . Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren insists she is not not not not not going to run for president in 2016. But that won't stop liberal groups from pleading. And Jonathan Martin of The New York Times shared with us reporting on how Warren plans to be a constant source of pressure on front-runner Clinton even if she never comes close to being a candidate. ""I talked to a longtime friend of hers who said the Clintons don't understand this -- they think this is all some kind of a setup for her to run for president,"" said Martin. ""This friend of Warren said this is who she is. She really believes in this stuff. And she gets the fact that she has this moment, and she's taking advantage of that."" 3. Jindal a 2016 GOP sleeper to watch in Iowa . Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal fires out frequent press releases to national political reporters and aggressively makes the rounds to the states and events that raise a presidential profile. Yet he has been largely ignored in 2016 speculation and barely registers in polls. But Robert Costa of The Washington Post says his recent visit to Iowa convinced him to keep an eye on Jindal and his early efforts. ""He may be a Catholic convert, he may be from a Southern state, but he spent a lot of time this week making connections with Iowa evangelicals,"" said Costa. ""I was with him in West Des Moines and he spent over three hours shaking hands, making a speech about his conversion and his roots and his family's immigrant story."" 4. Should all eyes be on the House? The spotlight will be on the new Republican Senate majority and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell when the 114th Congress gavels in. But maybe the other chamber is really the one to watch. A lot of the new senators are expected to vote with the GOP leadership, but insiders on the Hill have been telling The Atlantic's Molly Ball that there's a lot more uncertainty about what's going to happen in the House. ""It's a real wild card in the House whether (Speaker John) Boehner is going to be empowered by this larger majority or whether they're going to be a bigger thorn in his side in the way we've seen in the past,"" said Ball. ""So as we look to whether the relative harmony and lack of drama of this lame-duck period can continue in the new Congress, I think that's going to be a major factor."" 5. February flashpoints will test McConnell's new role and the tea party's power . January will likely be a relatively peaceful month here in Washington. The new Congress will be organizing and the President will deliver his State of the Union address. But February will hit some major Republican flashpoints. Congress first and foremost needs to revisit the immigration debate, because it has to fund the Department of Homeland Security. And it is in February when McConnell plans to have his promised  vote to repeal Obamacare. McConnell knows he doesn't have the votes for an Obamacare repeal or to force any sweeping reversals of the new White House immigration policy. So what he's hoping for is to put some votes on the record and then look for incremental steps on things that can inspire at least modest Democratic support. He believes the vast majority of his Republican members are ready now to ignore the tea party complaints of surrender. McConnell's take is that 2014 proved the tea party is loud, but not able to deliver on threats to Republican incumbents. February will test whether other Republicans buy that.","The calculations behind Obama's ""girl power"" moment at the press briefing .

"A month after being released to mostly positive reviews, Samsung's flagship phone is getting some validation from Consumer Reports. The publication has run all its tests, kicked the phone's tires, and named the Android-powered Galaxy S4 its top rated smartphone. The previous list-topper was the Optimus G, a solid $100 4.7-inch phone from LG that held Consumer Reports' No. 1 spot for several months. The Optimus G is now ranked as the No. 2 smartphone, followed by the HTC One, the Samsung Galaxy S3 and the Apple iPhone 5. Consumer reports bases its ratings on a number of extensive tests and rates the devices in categories including ease of use, display and voice quality, portability and battery life. The $200 Galaxy S4's weakest scores were in video quality and portability. Like all the other smartphones on the list, it also had mediocre scores for voice quality, a sacrifice that seems common in the smartphone market. The publication also lamented the lack of one-button phone access. Consumer Reports specifically called out the S4's 5-inch, 1080p touch-screen, multitasking in split view, and a built-in IR feature as some of the handset's standout features. The abundance of features were seen as appealing to more advanced users without complicating the phone for more entry-level users. The publication said the device's camera was ""among the best phone cameras for photo quality."" The Galaxy S4 is an update to Samsung's wildly popular S3 phone, which was one of the best selling smartphones of the past year. Samsung was the leader in the smartphone market in in the first quarter of 2013, according to research firm IDC, and it looks like its latest offering will help it hang on to that top spot for the time being. Last week, Google announced a new version of the Galaxy S4 that will run a pure form of the company's Android mobile operating system. That unlocked and uncluttered phone will cost $649 when it becomes available at the end of June.","Consumer Reports names the Galaxy S4 as top smartphone .

"(CNN) -- Former professional baseball pitcher Hideki Irabu was found dead at his California home, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said. Homicide detectives and representatives from the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office determined that he committed suicide, Sgt. Diane Hecht said Thursday. She did not know the method he used. His body was discovered in his Rancho Palos Verdes home about 4:20 p.m. Wednesday, Hecht said. Irabu, 42, was a successful and well-established player in Japan when he came to the United States after being drafted by the San Diego Padres in 1997, according to CNN affiliate KTLA. But Irabu refused to play for the Padres. He insisted that he would play only for the New York Yankees, a stand that helped create the system that Japanese players currently use if they wish to join the Major Leagues before they are eligible for free agency, according to an article on Major League Baseball's website. Sports Illustrated: Untimely athlete deaths . It was during Irabu's three seasons with the Yankees that he had an infamous altercation with owner George Steinbrenner, who called Irabu a ""fat toad,"" the website said. He played for the Montreal Expos and Texas Rangers before ending his time with the Major Leagues in 2002. Upon his retirement, he had a win-loss record of 34-35 and an earned-run average of 5.15, with 405 strikeouts in six seasons. In the years since he retired, he spent some time pitching in his native Japan and for a team in an independent league in California. CNN's Carey Bodenheimer contributed to this report.","Irabu helped create the current system used by Japanese players .

"President Barack Obama gave an impassioned speech to Democratic senators gathered at the White House overnight, urging them that new sanctions could damage negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program. ""They discussed Iran and the President made the case for why new sanctions legislation now would hurt us,"" a senior administration official told CNN Senior White House Correspondent Jim Acosta. A senator who was in the room Wednesday night called it ""one of the most powerful arguments"" about the issue he had ever heard from Obama. Obama's statements during the closed-door session comes as the clock is ticking on an interim nuclear deal with Iran. A six-month interim agreement formally begins Monday. That deal means that Iran must dismantle or freeze some of its nuclear program and open it to more international inspections in return for limited relief from crippling international sanctions. Assuming everything goes as planned, further negotiations between Iran and the United States, France, Russia, China, Britain and Germany will seek a broader agreement intended to prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon. Meanwhile, pro-Israel members of Congress are seeking additional sanctions against Iran that would take effect if the talks break down. Obama has said sanctions may mess up the pending negotiations.

"No criminal charges are being filed after an investigation into sexual abuse allegations made against former Amateur Athletic Union executive Robert ""Bobby"" Dodd, police in Memphis, Tennessee, said Tuesday. Ralph West -- a man who publicly accused Dodd of repeated sexual abuse in the 1980s when he was a teenager and Dodd was a Memphis-based YMCA coach -- has told investigators he does not plan to file a criminal offense report against Dodd, said police Sgt. Karen Rudolph. No one else has stepped forward to file a complaint since the allegations broke, and as a result, Rudolph said, police will ""not move forward"" with the case. ""If someone does file a complaint, we will investigate it,"" she said. ""It is unknown"" why West decided not to file a report against Dodd, Rudolph said. West and another former sports player who chose to remain anonymous were featured on ESPN's ""Outside the Lines"" program in December, detailing some of the abuse allegations. AAU officials said that in November, before the ESPN report aired, they had received anonymous phone calls and e-mail messages accusing Dodd of inappropriate behavior. The AAU hired a private investigator and launched its own internal investigation to scrutinize the anonymous tips. Dodd, 63, the AAU's longtime president and CEO, was dismissed on November 14, a week after allegations first began arriving. After a monthlong probe, the AAU went to police, the organization's interim president told CNN. ""We formed our own internal investigative process, and then once we found out who the accusers were, we immediately went to the police department,"" said Louis Stout. ""We didn't sit on this. No one has acted improperly within the Amateur Athletic Union regarding these accusations."" Steve Farese, Dodd's lawyer, told CNN Tuesday that he is not surprised that no charges are being filed. ""The world has changed and it's not for the better,"" he said, ""because now, unsubstantiated claims can be spread through the media and the Internet and destroy a 30-year body of good work. It's unfortunate ESPN decided to use a man's life to sell ads."" West and the player who remained anonymous had told ESPN the sexual abuse firestorm surrounding Penn State coach Jerry Sandusky prompted them to come forward. The YMCA said Dodd left in 1992 ""to pursue AAU sports full-time,"" including founding an organization called the YOMCA, which stands for Youth of Memphis Competitive Association and is unrelated to the YMCA. Dodd is now recovering from colon cancer surgery at his home in Florida, Farese said.","Robert Dodd had been accused of sexual abuse in the 1980s .

"French President Francois Hollande signed into law Saturday a bill allowing same-sex couples to marry and adopt. It came a day after the nation's top court, the Constitutional Council, ruled that the bill adheres to the constitution. ""The most historic part is that future generations will no longer have to ask themselves if they have the right to marry and if they are recognized by their country because now they are,"" Vincent Autin told CNN affiliate BFMTV. He and his companion said they plan to become the first same-sex couple to tie the knot in France when they do so on May 29 in Montpellier. The city in southern France issued a statement inviting people to attend. Autin, who had campaigned for the change, said the new law represents ""the vision of modernity, the vision of equality, the vision of respect for all and for all couples, all the children."" In a last-ditch attempt to stop the bill from becoming law, conservative opponents filed a legal challenge after lawmakers approved it. Passing legislation to allow same-sex marriage was one of Hollande's election pledges in campaigning last year. In a statement Friday, he recognized the controversial nature of the bill, but said France was able to listen to and respect different points of view. ""I'm convinced that with the passage of time this law will be seen for what it is: progress for equality and for freedom,"" he said. The move was opposed by many conservatives and the Catholic Church in France, prompting hundreds of thousands of people to turn out for protest marches in Paris as politicians debated the bill. Many conservatives and the Catholic Church opposed the move, prompting hundreds of thousands of protesters to march in Paris as politicians debated the bill. Same-sex marriage: Who will legalize it next? The new law, published Saturday morning after Hollande's signature, admits France to a small but growing club. It is the ninth country in Europe to allow same sex marriage. Lawmakers in New Zealand this year made it the first country in the Asia-Pacific region to legalize same-sex marriage. The law is set to be enacted later this year. Uruguayan lawmakers have also approved a measure allowing same-sex marriage. It awaits the signature of Uruguay's president, who has indicated he supports it. If the laws in New Zealand and Uruguay are enacted as expected, the count of nations allowing same-sex marriage will rise to 14. The first same-sex couples walked down the aisle in the Netherlands in 2001, with others following suit in Canada, South Africa, Belgium and Spain. Argentina was the first Latin American nation to legalize such marriages, in 2010. Other countries on the list are Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Portugal and Sweden. Many countries remain split over the issue. A Brazilian court this week issued a directive removing a barrier that had limited same-sex marriage, but no bill has made it through Congress. Legislators in the United Kingdom are also weighing proposals to legalize same-sex marriage. Lawmakers in Australia voted against a bill to legalize same-sex marriage last September. A poll for the advocacy group Australian Marriage Equality indicated that 64% of those surveyed ""support marriage equality."" In the United States, the question went before the Supreme Court and justices are deliberating over the matter. Twelve U.S. states and the District of Columbia have legalized same-sex marriages. On the other side, many states have specific laws blocking same-sex couples from legally marrying.","Couple plans first such ceremony .

"(CNN) -- Any baseball fan who has been alive in the last decade is familiar with a truism: ""That's just Manny being Manny."" It has been used to describe one of the best outfielders in baseball history, Manny Ramirez, who -- like a certain Vice President -- had a way of stumbling into (and creating) some truly terrible press. Like Joe Biden, Ramirez was colorful, beloved and often forgiven. He could be endearing, running an American flag out onto the field with a wide boyish smile after becoming a U.S. citizen. He was certainly amusing, retreating into the Green Monster at Boston's Fenway Park during the games to take a call, or high-fiving a fan in the middle of a play. Sometimes his antics were cringe-worthy. There was the time he successfully stole second base, but effectively ""returned"" it when he was thrown out inexplicably jogging back to first. And occasionally, Ramirez was a legitimate problem: shoving aging traveling secretary Jack McCormick over a ticket request, faking injuries to get out of key games, violating the league's drug policy and blasting his own team in the media. Eventually shrugging off ""Manny being Manny"" became harder and harder to do. Biden, however, still seems to get away with ""being Biden."" Until now, maybe. After criticizing key Arab allies in our fragile anti-ISIS coalition -- including Turkey, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia at a time when muscling the resolve to go after the terrorist fighters in Syria and Iraq is a heavy lift for everyone involved -- Biden's ""gaffe"" is one that could come with significant consequences. He quickly offered apologies to Turkey and the UAE for suggesting at a Harvard University forum that they had inadvertently helped strengthen ISIS. Issuing public apologies -- especially when technically Biden's assertions are true, if incomplete -- is an unequivocal embarrassment for the White House, which has been defending itself against criticism of incompetence all year. Not to mention that getting this coalition together in the first place was, as Joe Biden might say, a big effing deal. And so, slamming our partners in a nakedly political attempt to defend President Obama's policies to a group of college students understandably didn't sit well with our friends overseas. Biden seems to have a hard time remembering that he is a proxy for the President and the policies of the United States. In fact, back in 2012, Biden explained his spontaneous declaration that Obama was ""absolutely comfortable"" with same-sex marriage -- well before Obama was ready to -- this way, according to Jo Becker's book ""Forcing the Spring:"" ""I didn't go out volunteering a position, but when asked a question...I had to respond to it."" Except, of course, that Biden did volunteer a position, not just his own but the President's. It was a moment that so confounded and infuriated the administration that Valerie Jarrett accused him of ""downright disloyalty,"" according to Becker's book. Publicly, anyway, Obama put on a happy face, saying he would have ""preferred to have done this in my own way, on my own terms,"" but ""all's well that ends well."" Unlike Biden's other category of gaffes -- off-color blurting and uncomfortable racial stereotyping -- this one had real political consequences, but ultimately boiled down to what was merely an election-year headache for the President. Now, though, Biden's undiplomatic slam against our Arab coalition could unravel an already precarious military and political partnership that the Obama administration has leaned on heavily to sell intervention both abroad and here at home. Let's hope they don't decide this was just the excuse they needed to pull out altogether and once again leave the United States to shoulder the burden of fighting terrorism in their own backyards.","S.E.

"Mitt Romney showed up Tuesday night talking about ""binders full of women"" being brought to him when he was governor. Sounds kind of kinky and certainly not something you want to be touting. The phrase was part of Romney's answer to a question from an audience member at the second presidential debate about how he would ""rectify the inequalities in the workplace."" Referring to when he took over as Massachusetts governor, he said, ""I had the chance to pull together a Cabinet, and all the applicants seemed to be men,"" he said. ""I went to a number of women's groups and said, 'Can you help us find folks?' and they brought us whole binders full of women."" The ""binders"" moment went viral immediately on Twitter, spawning  @RomneysBinders and @womaninabinder Twitter handles. As of Wednesday morning, almost 300,000 people had supported a Facebook page about what a politically dumb statement it was. Romney may soon say it was ""inelegant"" phrasing or he didn't finish his statement or some other excuse, but the comment shows why voters, especially women, don't trust him and don't believe he has their back. CNN Money: Bindersfullofwomen.com snapped up in 90 seconds . In fairness, ""binders"" was most likely a slip of the tongue. But Romney said it in an effort to obfuscate and pivot from the issue at hand: equality for women. He avoided the real question, and that, and his remark, spoke volumes. Even as a slip of the tongue, this odd phrase betrays Romney's true lack of understanding, knowledge and comfort level on women's equality. And besides the binders comment, there are several problems with the story Romney told Tuesday night. First of all, it is not true. The ""binder"" of women's résumés was prepared before the election by the Massachusetts Government Appointments Project, a coalition of nonpartisan women's groups. When Romney won, the women -- not in binders --  gave him the résumés. Romney told that story in an effort to demonstrate how well his administration had done in hiring women.  Except it didn't.  A study  by the University of Massachusetts and the Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy shows that the percentage of women in senior positions during his tenure actually declined.   It went from 30% when Romney took office to 27% when he left and up to more than 33% after the new governor took over. Did Romney undo gains with women? Also, it  boggles the mind that throughout his decades-long career in business, Romney had not come across any qualified women he could appoint to his Cabinet.  The Romney campaign points to longtime aide Beth Myers, but she was not in the Cabinet. The more reasonable explanation is that diversity of gender, or any kind of diversity, was never an important tenet of corporate leadership for Romney.  Which is why he did not proactively seek out the ""binders full of women"": Women's groups, in fact, came looking for him. All of this goes to the heart of why Romney has had such a hard time winning over the women's vote. He answered the audience member's question from the standpoint of a detached CEO who knew that he had to find qualified women to serve in his administration come hell or high water, given the vast disparity between men and women holding management positions.  He must have known he would be blasted if he didn't do it.  In this day and age, this should be a no-brainer. You should not ask the American people to give you a medal for hiring qualified women. The dissonance when it comes to the governor and women went even further at the debate. Romney not only couldn't answer the question about women' equality, he could not even answer a question about outlawing AK-47s without bringing up single mothers. Saying he did not believe in changing gun laws, he seemed to equate children raised by single parents with the ""culture of violence."" I may be wrong, but I don't think that is a good strategy to get struggling single moms to vote for you. Tech: Social world thumbs through 'binders full of women' President Obama, in contrast, answered the equality question not just from a personal standpoint as a father but also as a commander in chief who signed a bill into law that guaranteed women could receive equal pay for equal work, the Lilly Ledbetter Act. Romney conspicuously never said whether he supported that act. The president's approach was much more in synch with what women want to hear and with what all Americans know to be fair. The binders comment was even more unfortunate for Romney in that he said it in the midst of Obama's very strong showing. The president clearly showed that he had the fight, the passion and the commitment to continue to work for middle-class voters -- on jobs, on health care, on taxes, on education, on immigration and, yes, on women's issues. This all underscores Romney's inability to really connect with voters. Although he seemed to win a little more favor among women after the first debate, I predict binders of polling data as to why that movement stopped after Tuesday night.","Romney's ""binders full of women"" debate remark is a viral phenomenon .

Cardona: ""Binders"" comment shows how out of touch Romney is with women's issues .
Cardona: The story and his claims about hiring women in Massachusetts are false ."
"Military veterans are dying needlessly because of long waits and delayed care at U.S. veterans hospitals, a CNN investigation has found. What's worse, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is aware of the problems and has done almost nothing to effectively prevent veterans dying from delays in care, according to documents obtained by CNN and interviews with numerous experts. The problem has been especially dire at the Williams Jennings Bryan Dorn Veterans Medical Center in Columbia, South Carolina. There, veterans waiting months for simple gastrointestinal procedures -- such as a colonoscopy or endoscopy -- have been dying because their cancers aren't caught in time. The VA has confirmed six deaths at Dorn tied to delays.  But sources close to the investigation say the number of veterans dead or dying of cancer because they had to wait too long for diagnosis or treatment at this facility could be more than 20. ""It's very sad, because people died,"" said Dr. Stephen Lloyd, a private physician specializing in colonoscopies in Columbia. Lloyd and other physicians across South Carolina's capital city are being affected by the delays at Dorn as veterans seek treatment or diagnoses outside the VA hospital. Lloyd is one of the few doctors in the area willing to speak on the record about the situation at Dorn. ""(Veterans) paid the ultimate price,"" he said. ""People that had appointments had their appointments canceled and rescheduled much later. ... In some cases, that made an impact where they went into a later stage (of illness) and therefore lost the battle to live."" Oneal Sessions, a 63-year-old Vietnam veteran, said he was told by staff members at Dorn Medical Center this year that he didn't need a colonoscopy.  Instead, he said, they gave him a routine test that would show whether he had polyps that are cancerous or in danger of becoming cancerous. Sessions said the VA told him to return in several years. Thanks for your service, vets! Now try finding a job . But he ignored that advice and had a colonoscopy in the office of his private physician, Lloyd. In that procedure, Lloyd found and removed four polyps. Two of those polyps were pre-cancerous, the physician said. Had Sessions waited another few years, Lloyd said, he could have had colon cancer. ""There is a little problem that the VA had,"" Sessions said.  ""My feeling is, the VA is not doing their 'pre-stuff' that they should do to protect the veterans."" What happened at the Dorn hospital, however, was not just an oversight by the hospital.  Government documents obtained exclusively by CNN and not made public show that the hospital knew that its growing waiting list and delays in care were having deadly consequences. Medical investigators reviewed the cases of 280 gastrointestinal cancer patients at Dorn and found that 52 were ""associated with a delay in diagnosis and treatment."" The government documents CNN obtained illustrate just how bad delays at Dorn got: . • In May 2011, a patient was brought into the emergency room needing urgent care after suffering multiple delays, and the documents state ""that was the facility's first realization that patients were 'falling through the cracks.' "" • Another veteran had to wait nine months for a colonoscopy -- ""a significant delay,"" according to VA records, that ""would have impacted the stage at which he was diagnosed."" The record indicates that by the time this veteran had surgery, his cancer was at stage 3. • Still another patient recommended for possible disease of the esophagus had to wait four months for an appointment and 11 months for an endoscopy, at which time he learned that he had later-stage esophageal cancer.  The internal VA report says that without the delay, ""his cancer would have been diagnosed much earlier.""  And though the report doesn't not say whether the veteran died, it does say that an earlier screening would have provided earlier detection ""with better survival."" • In July 2011, a hospital physician sent a warning to administrators that the backlog for Dorn patients' gastrointestinal appointments had reached 2,500, and patients were waiting eight months -- until February 2012 --  for appointments. • By December 2011, the documents show, the backlog at Dorn had grown to 3,800 patients, according to another warning e-mail from a physician. Read the full VA investigation board report (PDF) Little was done to effectively resolve the problems, according to expert sources and documents. In September 2013, the VA's inspector general affirmed details of the delays at Dorn in stark language, stating that 700 of the delays for appointments or care were ""critical."" Read the full IG report on Dorn (PDF) Perhaps most troubling of all is that the problem at the Dorn facility had been identified, and taxpayer money was given to fix the problem in September 2011. ""We appropriated a million dollars (to Dorn) because VA asked for it,"" said Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Florida, chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs. The documents obtained by CNN show that only a third of that $1 million from Congress was used for its intended purpose at Dorn: to pay for care for veterans on a waiting list. The VA ""will say, 'we redirected those dollars to go somewhere it was needed,' "" Miller said. ""Where would it be more needed than to prevent the deaths of veterans?"" At the same time, the documents show, the waiting list at Dorn kept growing to 3,800 patients in December 2011. ""These are real people that we're talking about, that are being harmed -- either made sick, will be sick in the future or have died,"" Miller said. Documents and interviews show that the problem goes beyond delayed colonoscopies and other gastrointestinal procedures at Dorn. CNN has learned from documents and interviews that other VA facilities have been under scrutiny by officials over possible delays in treatment or diagnoses. Shortly before CNN published this report, the VA acknowledged that there have been concerns about delay of care at some of its facilities. At the Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center in Augusta, Georgia, the VA said three veterans died as a result of delayed care.  Internal documents at that facility showed a waiting list of 4,500 patients. The VA also acknowledged that it investigated delays at facilities in Atlanta, North Texas and Jackson, Mississippi. The VA said no ""adverse outcomes"" because of delays were found at the VA centers in Texas and Mississippi. Homeless vet in makeover video has long road ahead . CNN also has learned that, though little publicized, the problem is not new. ""Long wait times and a weak scheduling policy and process have been persistent problems for the VA, and both the GAO and the VA's (inspector general) have been reporting on these issues for more than a decade,"" said Debra Draper of the Government Accountability Office. Draper's office has been reporting to Congress on the delays in care at the VA for years. It is so bad, she said, that she and her staff have found evidence that VA hospitals have tried to cover up wait times, fudge numbers and backdate delayed appointments in an effort to make things appear better than they are. She says that just getting someone to pick up the phone to make an appointment at a VA hospital can be difficult. And getting a detailed picture of the problem is nearly impossible, she said. ""It's unclear how long it is being delayed, because no one can really give you accurate information,"" Draper said. Despite numerous reports and subsequent recommendations by the GAO, the problems with delays persist at VA hospitals, Draper and other experts say. What veterans want you to know about military service . ""Nothing has been implemented that we know of at this point,"" Draper said. ""We've reported similar things, as well as the inspector general has reported similar findings ... for over a decade."" In fact, time and time again, even at hospitals where veterans died waiting for care, administrators got bonuses, not demotions, according to congressional investigators. The House Committee on Veterans' Affairs has created a website devoted to what investigators say shows ongoing problems at the VA, but the rewards system that Miller says is in place seems to encourage those problems. CNN's repeated requests for interviews with the VA have been denied. Even Congress has had its requests for information ignored, Miller said. ""But unfortunately, if they treat members of Congress ... this way, imagine how they treat the average veteran out there,"" said Miller. ""I can imagine the grief they may be going through."" The VA said in a statement to CNN, ""The Department of Veterans Affairs is committed to providing the best quality, safe and effective health care our Veterans have earned and deserve. We take seriously any issue that occurs at one of the more than 1,700 health care facilities across the country.  The consult delay at Dorn VAMC has been resolved."" The statement added that cases are now tracked daily, and additional staff members were hired. But sources at Dorn -- both patients and medical staff -- tell CNN that's just not true.

"On his recent visit to Mexico, President Barack Obama called on both our nations to let go of attitudes ""trapped in old stereotypes."" Sadly, a column written for CNN by Ruben Navarrette -- ""Should the U.S. be more like Mexico?"" -- makes just the sort of sweeping generalizations about a diverse country of 110 million people that the U.S. president urged us to avoid. It might come as news to Navarrette that the Mexico of his grandparents, which still seems to inform his view of the country, is no longer an accurate description of a nation that, in 2013, has a growing, sophisticated middle class and is a relevant and responsible actor in global affairs. Because Navarrette says Americans should be fully informed on the matter, his misinformed and outdated characterization of Mexican society deserves some correcting. With regard to immigration, Mexico respects the sovereign right of the United States to determine its own immigration policy, and the American people and their political representatives will ultimately determine what course that policy takes in the United States. Navarrette's depiction of Mexico's immigration policy, however, is inaccurate and outdated. To my knowledge, no Mexican official has ever expressed a desire for a porous northern border. Moreover, in 2011, Mexico passed its own immigration reform focused on the decriminalization of immigration and providing protection for migrants, regardless of their migratory status. The legislation earned praise from the United Nations and established a solid framework to assist in the protection of migrant rights while better aligning Mexico's domestic policy with international treaties on migration. Those significant steps do not merit an easy dismissal with a rhetorical wave of the hand. They are meaningful changes that will affect lives. Navarrette's column goes on to paint Mexicans as desperate to escape their home country, but the numbers tell a very different story. According to a 2012 report by the Pew Hispanic Center, migration between the United States and Mexico is at net zero. And a recent Gallup survey found that only 11% of Mexicans would like to change their country of residence;  that number is identical to the 11% of Americans who say the same thing. By 2010, around 40% of Mexico's population had joined the ranks of the middle class, according to data from INEGI, Mexico's national bureau of statistics. The characterization of Mexico as a bifurcated country of rich and poor is less accurate than ever, and according to in-depth research from economist Luis de la Calle and writer Luis Rubio, authors of ""Mexico: A Middle Class Society,"" that trend is expected to continue. It is not something that has happened by accident. To say, as Navarrette does, that Mexico ""has no real economic policy beyond tourism"" is not to be paying attention. Mexico's fiscal discipline, which will include another balanced budget this year, has led to the steady macroeconomic growth that is directly responsible for lifting many Mexicans into the middle class. Our tourism industry, which also somehow appears to be worthy of Navarrette's disdain, does so well because Mexico is heir to two of history's greatest civilizations, and is a country of astounding natural beauty. The Mexican government embraces those realities and so do the millions of visitors we welcome, who generated $11 billion in  revenue last year. But the idea that Mexico is content to rest on its tourism industry requires willful blindness to the  transformations taking place in our nation. As a result of unprecedented agreements between the country's main political parties, Mexico has recently pushed through large-scale reforms to education, anti-trust laws and legal procedures, with energy reform still on the agenda. Does that sound like a country with no real plan beyond tourism? The administration does have a National Development Plan, although Navarrette claims it does not exist. The tone of the column pits Mexico and the United States in a sort of competition, deeming one of our countries ""superior"" to the other. For our part, we stand by the U.N. Charter that affirms the sovereign equality of all its members. Careless comments about superiority easily lend themselves to racism and xenophobia. Thankfully, bilateral cooperation between our nations has long since moved beyond such thinking. Twenty years after the implementation of NAFTA, Mexico and the United States have become global partners. Our relationship is not one of competition and rivalry but of synergy and complementarity. For example, the National Bureau of Economic Research has estimated that nearly 40% of Mexican exports to the United States contain components manufactured in the U.S. Mexico is also the second largest export market for U.S. goods. In fact, according to the Woodrow Wilson Center's Mexico institute, some 6 million U.S. jobs depend on trade with Mexico. Our nations build things together to sell here and abroad, and business is booming. In 2011, trade between our two countries reached $500 billion. But we share more than business and value-added chains -- we share geography and people. Our people live together, work together and break bread together. Given that 30% of immigrants in the United States are of Mexican origin and Mexico is home to the largest community of American expatriates in the world, both our countries have a responsibility to ensure that we continue to grow together. Mexico and its people are evolving, and both our countries are stronger for it. If I may invoke the words of President Obama once more, ""It's time to put old mindsets aside.""","Ariel Moustatsos: Ruben Navarrette's column full of misinformation about Mexico .

"(CNN)Most moms will say that ""mom judgment"" drives them batty and that they long for a day when moms actually stop criticizing one another. But how many will admit they actually aren't just on the receiving end, that they do some of the judging themselves? I'm not proud to say I've done my share of it, especially when I see a child having a meltdown in a restaurant. My compassionate self remembers when my daughters went boneless on me as toddlers, but from time to time, a quick judgy thought comes before the sensitivity: ""Shouldn't that mom do something to control her child?"" Michelle Noehren, founder and manager of the site Connecticut Working Moms, says she's guilty of having similar thoughts when she sees a child having a tantrum in a store. But here's the million-dollar question: Why are we so quick to judge other moms? ""I think a lot of it stems from feeling strongly attached to our own opinions and choices,"" said Noehren, a mom of a 3-year-old daughter in Glastonbury, Connecticut. ""When we hold tightly to our opinions of what we think is best, it can be hard to understand that others might do something different than we do, and that's completely OK."" Tired of all the judging and hoping to help pave the way for more sisterhood and support among moms, Noehren and her fellow moms at CTWorkingMoms have delivered an encore to their fabulous photo spread ""End the Mommy Wars,"" which went viral last year. In the latest one, which they call ""Hugs, Not Judgment,"" moms hold up signs with messages such as ""The mom in me honors the mom in you. Namaste."" Another sign reads, ""If it works for you and your family, stick with it. Try not to think about what everyone else thinks."" And another, which says, ""Trust your instinct. You have the power to know what's best for your children."" ""In a culture that likes to pit moms against moms, it's rare to see images of us coming together in a loving, supportive way,"" Noehren said. ""Take one look at your Facebook news feed, and you're bound to see at least one headline from either a media outlet or parenting website that encourages judgment by saying things like '10 reasons breastfeeding is best.' "" (The judgment there: If you don't breastfeed, you are clearly not doing enough to take care of your baby!) Why are we so quick to cry 'bad mother'? I'm all for ending the judgment, but isn't it wishful thinking to believe we can actually kiss it goodbye and replace it with sisterhood and camaraderie? I mean, how can you prevent that judgy voice from rearing its ugly head? Noehren has one piece of advice, and in my humble opinion, it's something you can actually do. The minute a judgy thought enters your mind, how about replacing it with a positive one? Instead of wondering why the mom in Target can't get her son or daughter under control, Noehren wrote in a blog post, how about thinking something like, ""Maybe that mom has had a really hard day and geez my kid has tantrums, too, I don't know what her situation is like so who am I to judge it? ""And then I feel a million times better because it feels better to choose love over judgment. It's like we're not only giving our own heart a little hug. We're giving that other mom a little hug too (albeit, in our mind)."" Longing for the carefree parenting style of yesterday? Easy enough, right? I hope the next time my parenting is less than perfect in public, which could be as early as this evening, another mom will try this approach. She'll feel better, and I will, too. How do you think we can stop moms from judging other moms? Tell Kelly Wallace on Twitter or CNN Living on Facebook.","Connecticut Working Moms launched photo series, ""Hugs, Not Judgment""

"A new study finds that 28% of parents following the CDC-recommended schedule for childhood vaccinations think it would be safer to delay the shots until children are older. The study, published Monday in the journal Pediatrics, confirms that about 2% of parents living in the United States are refusing all vaccines for their children, and more than one in 10 alter the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-recommended vaccination schedule by delaying or refusing certain vaccines. Among parents following an alternative vaccine schedule, 30% actually began with the regular schedule, but then changed their minds. ""I was surprised by the malleability of people's attitudes"" said Dr. Amanda Dempsey, one of the study authors. ""In my own clinical practice, I have been more used to parents pretty firmly decided one way or the other what they wanted to do."" Parents are refusing certain vaccines at higher rates than others, the study finds. H1N1 and the seasonal flu vaccine topped the rejection list. Among vaccines delayed until a child grows older, the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, a two-stage vaccine administered at 12 months and then again at age 4, topped the list. Pediatricians generally stay sensitive to parents' concerns, accommodating alternative vaccine schedules when requested. ""There is a small group of pediatricians, and I think it's growing slowly, that tell patients, 'If you come into our practice, we are immunizing your children according to the CDC's and the American Academy of Pediatrics standard schedule,'"" said Dr. William Schaffner, who chairs the department of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. ""[They say] 'Anything less than that is not appropriate for your child. If you're uncomfortable with that, God bless you, here are the names of some other pediatricians in town who will likely take care of your children.'"" Schaffner said the main problem, as he sees it, is that parents have no knowledge of the diseases their children are being inoculated against. The diseases have sort of faded from the public consciousness, but can spring back if enough of the population goes unvaccinated. This year has seen more cases of measles than any year since 1996. As of  August, there have been 198 confirmed cases in the United States, according to the CDC, with the vast majority among the unvaccinated. Usually the transmission comes from traveling abroad. Not only do unvaccinated children run the risk of becoming ill or worse, but they also endanger others who don't have the option to vaccinate. For example, children under 12 months old and those with certain medical conditions like HIV don't receive the MMR vaccine. Instead they rely on a ""herd effect,"" unprotected themselves, but living among a population where disease can't find a foothold. In Europe, the measles outbreak has been far worse than in the United States, with thousands of confirmed cases correlating with a decline in vaccination rates sparked by Andrew Wakefield's 1998 fraudulent study alleging a connection between the MMR vaccine and autism. Globally, measles still is a leading cause of death among children, killing an estimated 450 people every day, according to the World Health Organization. But many parents fear the vaccines carry a more immediate risk and do damage in ways perhaps not yet documented by medical researchers. What public health officials do know is that about one in six children will experience a fever and one in 3,000 will have a seizure after receiving the MMR vaccine, according to the National Institutes of Health, but  severe side effects are extremely rare, and there is no evidence of a link to autism. Parents noticing any reaction in their child after vaccination should report the incident using the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. Regarding her research into parents' ""malleable"" attitudes on vaccines, Dempsey said figuring out what is swaying parents away from the recommended schedule is  important, and something her research cannot yet answer.","Two percent of parents living in the United States are refusing all vaccines for their children .
2011 has seen more cases of measles than in any year since 1996 .

"The threat to release nude photos of actress Emma Watson was an attempt to start a viral marketing campaign to shutter the site 4chan. After her impassioned speech for gender equality last weekend at the United Nations, Watson faced backlash, including a threat to leak alleged nude photos of the star. Business Insider reported that an anonymous 4chan user had posted a countdown timer with a picture of the ""Harry Potter"" actress wiping away a tear hinting that she could become the next star to have her iCloud hacked and personal photos dispersed for the world to see. Jennifer Lawrence, Kim Kardashian and Gabrielle Union are among the celebrities recently to have private, intimate photos splashed across the Internet. The 4chan site is where the hacked, nude photos of these other female stars initially appeared. On Wednesday, the site mentioned in the anonymous user's posting, EmmaYouAreNext.com, was redirecting to the company Rantic Marketing with the message #ShutDown4chan. ""Join us as we shutdown 4chan and prevent more private pictures from being leaked,"" a message on the site says. ""None of these women deserve this and together we can make a change."" There is also a letter to President Barack Obama that reads, ""We have been hired by celebrity publicists to bring this disgusting issue to attention. The recent 4chan celebrity nude leaks in the past 2 months have been an invasion of privacy and is also clear indication that the internet NEEDS to be censored. Every Facebook like, share & Twitter mention will count as a social signature -- and will be one step closer to shutting down www.4chan.org. "" Visitors to the site are offered a link to send the letter to the White House. Rantic bills itself on its site as ""a social media marketing enterprise that has participated in some of the most viral campaigns and music videos."" So far there is no evidence that nude pictures of Watson actually exist; 4chan, the online message board, has become known as a place where pranksters previously have posted hoaxes. Writing for The Washington Post, Soraya Nadia McDonald tied the threat, as well as false Internet reports that Watson had died, to ""a long history of this sort of bullying aimed at women on the Internet, especially feminists."" ""It's just the latest in a long history of online efforts to intimidate, belittle, threaten and cow women into hiding and shutting up -- the message, of course, being, if you dare to do or say something we don't like, we'll expose you in return,"" McDonald wrote. Watson's speech, delivered Saturday as part of her role as a goodwill ambassador for U.N. Women, drew attention for her poignant remarks about the need for equality and for men to embrace feminism. ""If men don't have to be aggressive in order to be accepted, women won't feel compelled to be submissive,"" she said. ""If men don't have to control, women won't have to be controlled. Both men and women should feel free to be sensitive. Both men and women should feel free to be strong. ... It is time that we all perceive gender on a spectrum, not as two opposing sets of ideals.""

"U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel visited the Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning at the Yuchi Naval Base at Qingdao on Monday, becoming the first foreigner allowed on board. The Department of Defense confirmed that the trip happened because of a U.S. request. ""The secretary was very pleased with his visit today aboard the carrier Liaoning,"" Pentagon Press Secretary Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby said in a statement. The Secretary was impressed with the professionalism with the ship's officers and crew, Kirby added, and said that Hagel understood the significance of the PLA's granting of his request. The tour lasted about two hours, and included a briefing, after which Hagel saw medical and living quarters, as well as the flight control center and bridge. Hagel also took a walking tour of the flight deck and launch stations. Hagel's visit suggests that U.S. efforts to encourage greater U.S.-China military ties are bearing some fruit. ""He hopes today's visit is a harbinger of other opportunities to improve our military-to-military dialogue and transparency,"" the press secretary said. The visit comes as China has deployed a huge force to aid in the hunt for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane far from its territorial waters. In late 2012, China announced that it had landed a fighter jet on the deck of the aircraft carrier for the first time. The Liaoning will be able to carry 30 J-15 fighter planes and will have a crew of 2,000, according to a People's Daily Online report published when it completed its first sea trials in August 2011. China bought the shell of the carrier, then called the Varyag, from Ukraine in 1998. Its construction began under the Soviet military before the breakup of the Soviet Union.

"It's not hard to dash out a Facebook status update saying how much you're digging ""House of Cards"" or the new Lorde song. But Facebook wants to make it even easier. The social network on Wednesday said it's rolling out an audio-recognition feature that lets you automatically tag music, TV shows or movies in status updates. The feature employs your phone's microphone to identify the song or TV show while it's playing and tag it in your post, saving you the trouble of typing it yourself. In this way, the new tool acts sort of like Shazam, the mobile app that can tell you what song is playing on the radio. Facebook said the unnamed feature will be available to U.S. users on Android and iOS devices ""in the coming weeks."" Of course, the more information Facebook users share about themselves and their tastes, the more Facebook can target ads at its 1.2 billion users. Here's how it works: If you've turned the feature on, you'll see an audio icon jiggling on your phone's screen as you write a status update. That means the feature is listening and trying to find a match; if it does, you can then add the song, TV show or movie to your post. As with any Facebook post, you can choose which of your friends can see it. You can also turn the feature off at any time by clicking an audio icon at the top right of the screen. Facebook said that if you choose to share a song, your friends can listen to a 30-second snippet. For TV shows, Facebook said your News Feed post will highlight the specific season and episode you're watching, ""so you can avoid any spoilers and join in conversations with your friends after you've caught up."" That's probably for the best -- nobody wants overeager commenters revealing unforseen deaths in ""Game of Thrones."" For movies, the feature will presumably work best for people watching at home, since most movie houses (and moviegoers) frown on glowing screens in the theater.","New Facebook feature helps you tag music, TV shows or movies in updates .

"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- A Russian scientist who was part of a swap for 10 Russian spies caught in the United States is now in England, his brother told CNN Sunday. Igor Sutyagin ""is in a small town on the outskirts of London,"" but doesn't know exactly where, his brother Dmitry said. ""He thinks he needs to take stock and consider what's going on in Russia, (and) in England,"" said Dmitry Sutyagin, who lives just outside Moscow. Sutyagin was convicted of espionage in Russia in 2004, according to Human Rights Watch, which said his trial and conviction were seriously flawed. Washington denies that he was a spy. Amnesty International warned Thursday that sending him abroad as part of the swap could amount to forcible exile, a violation of international law. His mother told Amnesty he had been forced to confess to spying in order to be freed from prison in a remote arctic region of Russia. Sutyagin is one of four people handed over on Friday in exchange for the 10 people who confessed in the United States to spying for Russia. The United States and Russia completed the swap Friday, exchanging them on chartered planes at an airport in Vienna, Austria, a U.S. official and Russian media said. The elaborately choreographed transfer -- which took place while the planes sat on the ground for about an hour -- was reminiscent of a scene from the Cold War. Attorney General Eric Holder said none of the 10 had passed classified information and therefore none had been charged with espionage. Under the plea agreements, the defendants disclosed their true identities in court, admitted to being agents for Russia, and forfeited assets attributable to the criminal offenses, the Justice Department said in a news release. ""Richard Murphy"" and ""Cynthia Murphy"" admitted they are Russian citizens named Vladimir Guryev and Lydia Guryev, the Justice Department said. ""Michael Zottoli"" and ""Patrica Mills"" admitted they are Russian citizens named Mikhail Kutsik and Natalia Pereverzeva. ""Donald Howard Heathfield"" and ""Tracey Lee Ann Foley"" admitted they are Russian citizens named Andrey Bezrukov and Elena Vavilova, and ""Juan Lazaro"" admitted that he is a Russian citizen named Mikhail Anatonoljevich Vasenkov. Vicky Pelaez, Anna Chapman and Mikhail Semenko operated in the United States under their true names, and Chapman and Semenko admitted they are Russian citizens, the Justice Department said. Authorities have lost track of an 11th suspect, who was detained in Cyprus, released on bail, and then failed to check in with authorities as he had promised to do. In Moscow, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed a decree Friday pardoning four Russians imprisoned for alleged contact with Western intelligence agencies, the Kremlin press service said, according to state-run RIA Novosti. ""Three of the Russian prisoners were convicted of treason in the form of espionage on behalf of a foreign power and are serving lengthy prison terms,"" the Justice Department said in a letter to U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood, who handled the case in the United States. ""The Russian prisoners have all served a number of years in prison and some are in poor health. The Russian government has agreed to release the Russian prisoners and their family members for resettlement."" The individuals pardoned by Russia are Alexander Zaporozhsky, Gennady Vasilenko, Sergei Skripal, and Sutyagin. All four appealed to the Russian president to free them after admitting their crimes against the Russian state, press secretary Natalia Timakova said. But in Washington, State Department spokesman Mark Toner denied Thursday that Sutyagin had been a spy. CNN's Arkady Irshenko, Richard Allen Greene and Bharati Naik contributed to this report.","Scientist doesn't know exactly where he is, his brother tells CNN .

"A court in eastern China sentenced Bo Xilai -- the former rising star of the ruling Communist Party who fell from power amid a scandal involving murder, betrayal and financial skullduggery -- to life in prison Sunday. Bo received the life sentence for bribe-taking, as well as 15 years for embezzlement and seven years for abuse of power. The sentences, which came shortly after the guilty verdicts, surprised some analysts. ""I'm actually a little bit surprised. I think it's a very strong verdict"" compared to some previous cases, said Yuhua Wang, a political science professor at University of Pennsylvania. ""He was a political star before falling from grace. He was ... the son of a revolutionary veteran. His father was Mao's colleague,"" he added. During the hearings of the politically sensitive trial that took place over several days last month, Bo, 64, denied the charges and strongly challenged the prosecution's case against him, according to accounts published by the Jinan Intermediate People's Court. The closely watched trial was considered to be much more transparent than most cases in China. But international and independent journalists weren't allowed inside the courtroom, and doubts were raised about the fullness of the court's version of events. 'I can bear the suffering' Days before the court announced the date for delivering the verdict, Bo reiterated his innocence but said he anticipated a lengthy imprisonment in a letter written to his family. ""I was dragged into this and really wronged, but the truth will come out one day,"" wrote Bo in a letter dated September 12, referring to the bribes allegedly taken by his wife and other scandals involving her and her friends. Read more: Five big moments from the trial . ""Meanwhile I will be waiting quietly in prison,"" Bo continued. ""Dad was thrown into prison multiple times in his lifetime and I will look up to him as my role model."" Bo's late father, Bo Yibo, was a revolutionary contemporary of Chairman Mao Zedong and late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. During the tumultuous Cultural Revolution that Mao launched in 1966, however, the senior Bo was persecuted, tortured and imprisoned for over a decade. He was ""rehabilitated"" in 1979 and became one of the most influential senior politicians under Deng. ""Dad and Mom have passed away, but their teachings are deeply ingrained in my mind,"" Bo wrote. ""I will never bring disgrace to them and their glory. I can bear the suffering no matter how great it is. ""I have put Mom's photo by my bed. With her by my side, I don't feel lonely."" Timeline: The Bo scandal . A source with close ties to the Bo family confirmed to CNN the authenticity of the letter, which has been circulating on the Internet. She adds that the content online is only part of the original letter, which appears to be addressing the family members -- including a son and four siblings -- present in the courtroom during his trial. Dramatic downfall . Bo's trial brought to light a wealth of eye-opening details about the apparently lavish and emotionally fraught life of his family and inner circle, giving Chinese people insights into how some of the ruling elite live. Analysis: Was Bo Xilai's trial in China truly transparent? His glittering career, during which he drew both admirers and detractors for his populist policies, fell apart last year. The son of a revolutionary veteran, Bo rose to power as a city mayor, provincial governor, minister of commerce and member of the Politburo, the powerful policy-making body of the Communist Party. He had been tipped to ascend farther up the party hierarchy. A charismatic and urbane politician, Bo was credited with a spectacular, albeit brutal, crackdown on organized crime during his time as the top party official of Chongqing, a metropolis in southwestern China. But when his deputy, Wang Lijun, walked into the U.S. Consulate in the city of Chengdu in February 2012 and told American diplomats that Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, was involved in a murder case, Bo's career began to unravel. Read more: Corruption fight a political purge? Wang's move precipitated Bo's political demise. Soon after news of the events began to emerge, Bo was removed from his party posts. A court found Gu guilty last year of murdering British businessman Neil Heywood in a Chongqing hotel room in 2011. She was given a suspended death sentence. The following month, Wang was convicted of bending the law for selfish ends, defection, abuse of power and bribe-taking. He received a 15-year prison sentence. Wang and Gu both appeared as witnesses at Bo's trial last month. Bo attacked their testimony and even claimed that Wang and Gu had been romantically involved.

"UK lawmakers took a big step Tuesday toward legalizing same-sex marriage, an issue that has prompted widespread rebellion within Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservative Party. In a 400-175 vote, MPs approved the second reading of a bill legalizing such marriage, indicating a significant majority of members support the measure. However, it must go through several more stages before it can become law. The bill faces another vote in the House of Commons and a vote in the House of Lords. Before Tuesday's vote, three top party members appealed to Conservative MPs to get behind the controversial legislation in a letter published in the Telegraph newspaper. The letter, signed by Chancellor George Osborne, Foreign Secretary William Hague and Home Secretary Theresa May, said that passing the bill is ""the right thing to do at the right time."" The institution of marriage has evolved over time, the letter said, while ""attitudes towards gay people have changed."" In a direct appeal to fellow party members, the trio added: ""We believe that opening it up to same-sex couples will strengthen, not weaken, the institution. As David Cameron has said, we should support gay marriage not in spite of being Conservatives, but because we are Conservatives."" Same-sex marriage around the world . Their attitude was echoed by Kate Green, a Labour MP, during debate. Tuesday's reading was the first opportunity for lawmakers in the House of Commons to debate the bill in detail. ""By recognizing and extending the definition of marriage to reflect today's greater openness towards, and recognition of, same-sex relationships, the legislation does not weaken the institution of marriage. On the contrary, it takes it forward, it strengthens it. It helps to perpetuate it,"" she said. The legislation passed the House of Commons with the support of lawmakers from Labour and the Liberal Democrats. The latter are in a coalition government with the Conservatives. As drafted, the bill would enable religious organizations to choose to conduct same-sex marriages if they wish and includes provisions intended to make sure no religious organization or person is forced to do so. The Church of England is among the religious bodies opposed to the legislation. The bill would also allow same-sex couples to convert a civil partnership to a marriage and enable married transsexual people to gain legal recognition in their acquired gender without having to end their marriages. A law recognizing civil partnerships in England and Wales was passed in 2004. Tony and Barrie Drewitt-Barlow, who are already same-sex civil partners and have five children together, told CNN that it was important to them to be able to marry in front of their fellow churchgoers. ""We want to be able to go into our local parish church, where we are practicing Christians, and under the eyes of the Lord, get married,"" said Barrie Drewitt-Barlow. ""I don't want to go in front of a vicar or priest who doesn't want to do it; it's supposed to be the happiest day of my life. I want to be really happy and joyous when I get married to the man that I've been together with for 25 years."" His partner, Tony, said it was a question of equality. ""Marriage is all about the union of two people that love each other and want to bind that love in a relationship that lasts forever. And for me, it's about having that right for everybody, gay, straight or bisexual,"" he said. ""Whatever you are, if you love that person, then you should have the rights to be joined in matrimony with them."" Cameron has said he is determined to push through legislation allowing same-sex marriage ""not only as someone who believes in equality but as someone who believes passionately in marriage."" Priests in same-sex relationships may become Anglican Bishops . But his commitment to that aim has set him at odds with many in his own party. A number of local party members wrote to the prime minister Sunday, urging him to reconsider. ""We feel very strongly that the decision to bring this Bill before Parliament has been made without adequate debate or consultation with either the membership of the Conservative Party or with the country at large,"" said the letter, published on the Conservative Grassroots website. ""Long-held religious and personal freedoms and the right to free speech will be adversely affected by the passing of this Bill."" The Church of England also outlined its objections to the bill in a briefing note sent to lawmakers Friday. It cannot support the legislation ""because of its concern for the uncertain and unforeseen consequences for wider society and the common good when marriage is redefined in gender-neutral terms,"" it said. It also argues that civil partnerships ""already confer the same rights as marriage"" and that allowing same-sex couples to marry will open the door to ""continued legal disputes for years to come."" The issue of same-sex marriage has also prompted wide disagreement elsewhere. Lawmakers in France's lower house of parliament, the National Assembly, on Saturday passed with a wide majority the most important article of a law to legalize same-sex marriage. Debate will continue for the next week on thousands of proposed amendments to the law, which would also open adoption to same-sex couples. The vote by French lawmakers followed big public protests against the bill, which has proved highly divisive in the majority Catholic country. In the United States, where President Barack Obama has voiced his personal support for same-sex marriage, it has been legalized in nine states and the District of Columbia. At the same time, 30 states have passed constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage, according to the Pew Research Center. Polls show the U.S. public has gradually become more accepting of same-sex marriage, with more Americans in favor in 2013 than opposed, according to Pew. Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Spain, South Africa and Norway are among nearly a dozen countries that allow same-sex marriages. According to a report released in May 2011 by the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, same-sex relations are still criminalized in 76 countries, and in five of those countries, the death penalty can be applied.

"Condoleezza Rice, former US secretary of state announced on Facebook Saturday that she would not be speaking at the Rutgers University commencement this year, following student protests against her appearance. The students made accusations against her in connection with the war in Iraq. ""Commencement should be a time of joyous celebration for the graduates and their families,"" Rice wrote. ""Rutgers' invitation to me to speak has become a distraction for the university community at this very special time."" In an open letter to the president of the school, printed in the student paper The Daily Targum on April 30th, ""Rutgers Student Protestors"" cited ""destruction"" in Iraq ""at the hands of the Bush administration."" ""Rice signed off to give the CIA authority to conduct their torture tactics for gathering information from detainees as well,"" the letter continues. ""These are clearly human rights issues. By inviting her to speak and awarding her an honorary degree, we are encouraging and perpetuating a world that justifies torture and debases humanity."" In 2009, a Senate intelligence report said that Rice approved waterboarding in the questioning of a suspected al Qaeda leader. Rice was National Security Adviser at the time. In publicized minutes of the February New Brunswick Faculty Council Meeting, Robert Boikess presented and moved for adoption a Resolution in Opposition to Condoleezza Rice as Commencement Speaker. ""Everything started blowing up when faculty council released their opposition,"" the editor in chief of The Daily Targum Alexandra R. Meier told CNN Saturday. In an article published Monday, Lin Lan, a staff writer for the school paper, called the 50 plus student sit in at the President's office one of the largest sit ins in Rutgers history. Police, Lan wrote, were called to the scene after a glass door was shattered. In an article published in the school paper Friday, staff writers Lan and Lidia De Los Santos said nearly 100 students gathered at the student center during a senate meeting that day to question the university president. President Robert Barchi posted a statement Saturday on the school website in response to Rice. ""While Rutgers University stands fully behind the invitation to Dr. Rice to be our commencement speaker and receive an honorary degree, we respect her decision not to participate in the upcoming Rutgers University commencement, which she clearly articulated in her statement this morning."" Rice wrote Saturday ""I am honored to have served my country. I have defended America's belief in free speech and the exchange of ideas. These values are essential to the health of our democracy. But that is not what is at issue here. As a Professor for thirty years at Stanford University and as its former Provost and Chief academic officer, I understand and embrace the purpose of the commencement ceremony and I am simply unwilling to detract from it in any way."" ""We did not see this coming at all"" the Meier told CNN Saturday night. She said that the feeling on campus is not one of relief. ""From my personal social media people are upset that the protest led to her declining her invitation...and I have seen a petition to get her back.""","Rutgers' president 'stands fully behind the invitation' but 'respects' her decision .

"What is widely recognized as the most authoritative study of the United States' responses to mass killings around the world -- from the massacres of  Armenians by the Turks a century ago, to the Holocaust, to the more recent Serbian atrocities against Bosnian Muslims and the ethnic cleansing of the Tutsis in Rwanda -- concluded that they all shared unfortunate commonalities: . ""Despite graphic media coverage, American policymakers, journalists and citizens are extremely slow to muster the imagination needed to reckon with evil. Ahead of the killings, they assume rational actors will not inflict seemingly gratuitous violence. They trust in good-faith negotiations and traditional diplomacy. Once the killings start, they assume that civilians who keep their head down will be left alone. They urge cease-fires and donate humanitarian aid."" This is an almost perfect description of how the United States has acted over the past two years as it has tried to come up with some kind of policy to end the Assad regime's brutal war on its own people in Syria. The author who wrote the scathingly critical history of how the United States has generally dithered in the face of genocide and mass killings went on to win a 2003 Pulitzer Prize for her book ""A Problem from Hell:  America and the Age of Genocide."" A decade after winning the Pulitzer, that author is now the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Her name, of course, is Samantha Power, and she is a longtime, close aide to President Barack Obama. She started working for Obama when he was a largely unknown junior senator from Illinois. Power called her 610-page study of genocide ""A Problem from Hell"" because that's how then-U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher referred to the Bosnian civil war and the unpalatable options available to the U.S. in the early 1990s to halt the atrocities by the Serbs. One of the U.S. officials that Power took to task in her book is Susan Rice who, as the senior State Department official responsible for Africa, did nothing in the face of the genocide unfolding in Rwanda in 1994. Rice is quoted in the book as suggesting during an interagency conference call that the public use of the word ""genocide"" to describe what was then going on in Rwanda while doing nothing to prevent it would be unwise and might negatively affect the Democratic Party in upcoming congressional elections. Rice later told Power she could not recall making this statement but also conceded that if she had made it, the statement was ""completely inappropriate, as well as irrelevant."" Rice is now Obama's national security adviser. In 2012, at Power's urging, Obama announced the creation of an interagency task force to help stamp out atrocities around the world. Called the Atrocities Prevention Board, it was led by Power during its first year. Meanwhile, the body count in Syria kept spiraling upward. For the past two years, Obama hasn't wanted to intervene militarily in Syria. Who would? The country is de facto breaking up into jihadist-run ""emirates"" and Alawite rump states. It is also the scene of a proxy war that pits al Qaeda affiliates backed by Qatar and Saudi Arabia against Hezbollah, backed by Iran. Whoever ultimately prevails in this fight is hardly going to be an ally of the U.S. It's an ungodly mess that makes even Iraq in 2006 look good. It is, in short, a problem from hell. Power, Rice and Obama today face some of the very same unpalatable choices that have confronted other U.S. national security officials as they tried to prevent mass killings in other distant, war-torn countries. They can continue to do little as the Syrian civil war drags on into its third year with 100,000 dead and rising. It's a state of affairs now compounded by the fact that the regime of President Bashar al-Assad appears not only to have crossed the ""red line"" with its use of chemical weapons but seems to have now sprinted past that line, killing hundreds with neurotoxins in a Damascus suburb, according to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. He's blasted those attacks as something that ""should shock the conscience of the world. It defies any code of morality."" Opinion: How Al-Assad used chemical weapons to poison debate on Syria . Doing nothing will not be treated kindly by future historians writing in the same vein as Power. The issue now in Syria is not simply that al-Assad is massacring his own civilians at an industrial rate, but he is also flagrantly flouting a well-established international norm by this regime's reported large-scale use of neurotoxins as weapons against civilians. It seems inconceivable that the United States as the guarantor of international order would not respond to this in some manner. But on what authority? There is scant chance of a U.N. resolution authorizing military action. When she was U.N. ambassador, Rice skillfully ushered a resolution through the Security Council that authorized military action in Libya in 2011. But Russia and China will almost certainly veto any similar kind of resolution on Syria. Russia is one of Syria's few allies, and Russia and China are generally staunchly against any kind of international intervention in the affairs of other countries, no matter how egregious the behavior of those states might be. That leaves the possibility of some kind of unilateral action by the United States. The U.S. regularly infringes the sovereignty of countries such as Pakistan and Yemen with CIA drone strikes on the novel legal theory that terrorists planning strikes on the U.S. are living in those nations and those countries are either unable or unwilling to take out the terrorists on their territory -- and therefore their sovereignty can be infringed by drone attacks. But making a claim that the Syrian regime threatens the U.S. is implausible, and therefore some kind of unilateral American action seems quite unlikely. In 1986, the Reagan administration launched air strikes at the homes of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, but only after an incident in which Libyan agents had bombed a disco in Berlin, killing two American servicemen. No such casus belli exists with Syria today. Since neither a U.N. authorized military mission nor a unilateral American strike seem likely, what options are left? One appealing option could be something along the lines of the Kosovo model. The Kosovo War in 1999 was entirely an air war in which no American soldiers were killed. The goal of the air campaign was to push Serbian forces out of Kosovo. Russia was allied with the Serbs so, as in the Syrian case today, there was no chance a U.N. resolution authorizing force would pass. At the time NATO justified the Kosovo War ""to avert a humanitarian catastrophe."" On Thursday, the British government released a similar statement saying that the grounds for military action against Syria ""would be humanitarian intervention; the aim is to relieve humanitarian suffering by deterring or disrupting the further use of chemical weapons."" But on Thursday night the British parliament voted against authorizing military action--a real setback for the Obama administration's plan to assemble something of a coalition to participate in any forthcoming operation in Syria. In the case of Kosovo, the war was conducted by NATO forces.  Kosovo is, of course, in Europe, and NATO is a Europe-focused security alliance while Syria is the Middle East, so NATO action there would be much more problematic. (A NATO force does fight in Afghanistan today, but that is only because one of its member states, the United States, was attacked on 9/11 from Afghanistan by al Qaeda, which triggered NATO's Article 5, the right to collective self-defense of the members of the alliance.) If an air war were to be launched against Syria, one scenario could be that Turkey, a member of NATO, could invoke Article 5 because Syria has fired into its territory on a regular basis. So far, Turkey has proved reluctant to invoke Article 5 but the reported large-scale use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime might change the calculus of the Turks. A further source of legitimacy for military action could be the strong statement Tuesday by the Arab League that the Assad regime is responsible for  the ""heinous crime"" of using chemical weapons. The Arab League is generally a toothless talking shop, which seemed to have surprised even itself two years back when it endorsed military action against Gadhafi. However, the Arab League has not endorsed any military action against Assad, although some of its members have privately urged the U.S. to take action against his regime in the past. It is hard to believe that some kind of military action against Syria won't now take place, likely in the form of U.S. cruise missile attacks from ships in the Mediterranean. Such attacks have the merit that they won't put U.S. aircraft at risk, which could well encounter problems with Syria's reputedly formidable air defense systems.  And the operation will likely have participation by France and a tacit green light from leading members of the Arab League such as Saudi Arabia, giving it a semblance of international legitimacy.","Samantha Power's Pulitzer-Prize winning study found U.S. very slow to fight evil regimes .

"Washington (CNN) -- Supporters of an Iranian opposition group claimed Thursday they have information about another secret facility tied to the Iranian government's nuclear program. According to Alireza Jafarzadeh, an Iranian-American with ties to the People's Mujahedeen of Iran, the facility is at a site referred to as TABA, just west of Tehran, and is designed to manufacture parts for centrifuges used to enrich uranium, a key component for civilian nuclear power as well as for nuclear weapons. A U.S. official who is not authorized to speak on the record said the United States is aware of the facility. Jafarzadeh told reporters at a news conference that over the past four and a half years the plant has produced enough parts to make more than 100,000 centrifuges, well beyond the needs for the nuclear facilities declared by the Iranian government to international monitors. He also maintained the site is under the control and supervision of the Iranian Defense Ministry. The International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors nuclear activities on behalf of the United Nations, has inspected Iran's declared enrichment facilities, but Iran does not provide details or access to sites where nuclear components are made. Soona Samsami, another supporter of the People's Mujahedeen of Iran, said the TABA site comprises three main warehouses over an area of nearly 48,000 square meters, or nearly 12 acres. She said the essential parts manufactured there include casings, magnets, molecular pumps, composite tubes, bellows and centrifuge bases. Although satellite photos were shown of the site, no direct evidence was provided other than to say the information was from members of the People's Mujahedeen organization inside Iran. The same group was the first to provide the details that publicly exposed the existence of Iran's clandestine nuclear program in 2002. Iran claims its nuclear program is for civilian energy needs, but the United States and other nations maintain Iran is working to develop fissile material for nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency said in its most recent report, in February, that Iran continues to stonewall the inspectors by not providing sufficient information or access to its facilities for inspectors to determine the ultimate purpose of Iran's nuclear program. Former nuclear inspector David Albright, who has closely followed developments concerning Iran's nuclear exploits, said he had no information about whether TABA is in fact a secret nuclear site. But he did question the claim that Iran has enough parts to make 100,000 centrifuges. ""There is no way Iran has made components for 100,000 centrifuges,"" said Albright, adding, ""It runs contrary to all indications that Iran has a shortage of raw materials."" According to Albright, Iran has indicated it wants to have 50,000 centrifuges and has so far manufactured 12,000 to 15,000 of them.

He said the opposition supporters challenge international sanctions as a way to highlight their goal of getting the United States to remove the People's Mujahedeen of Iran from its list of foreign terrorist organizations. At the news conference, Jafarzadeh -- saying that ""the revelations today show the policy pursued by the United States has not been productive in halting the nuclear program of Iran"" -- maintained that only a democratic Iran will succeed in eliminating the nuclear program, and that the best chance for democracy lies with the United States removing the People's Mujahedeen of Iran from its terrorist list.","An Iranian-American with ties to the People's Mujahedeen of Iran announces the find .

"Even though he has received threats, St. Louis Rams tight end Jared Cook stressed Wednesday that he did not intend disrespect toward police when he and other Rams players made the ""hands up, don't shoot"" gesture before Sunday's game against the Oakland Raiders. Cook acknowledged to reporters Wednesday that he has received hateful messages on Facebook. ""Well, I mean that's how people choose to operate their lives,"" Cook said. ""I feel like as men, just like me and you, are communicating right now, and just like me and you are talking right now, we should be able to sit down and talk about our problems. There is no reason to send threats or to hype up a situation that's already intensified. We can sit down and talk about our problems. If we can't, then let's just agree to disagree. There's no wrong in that. People have different opinions. People have different views. We're grown."" Black St. Louis police officers: 'Hands up' gesture by Rams players 'commendable' When asked if he had received a lot of threats, Cook answered, ""Absolutely."" The gesture that Cook and teammates Stedman Bailey, Tavon Austin, Chris Givens and Kenny Britt made when taking the field Sunday is the same one protesters have used to decry the death of unarmed black teen Michael Brown. That angered the St. Louis Police Officers Association, saying the players ""chose to ignore the mountains of evidence released from the St. Louis County Grand Jury"" after the jurors decided not to indict former Ferguson officer Darren Wilson. But Cook said Wednesday they respect police. ""Why would we come at the police in a disrespectful way when we work with the police in the community all of the time?"" Cook said. ""The police are up here every day. There were four police cars here this morning when I pulled into work. The police have picnics during the summer in our parking lot where they bring their kids and children to meet and greet and have fun with us. So why would I disrespect a group of men that we have complete respect for in the community that helps us every day?"" Cook said their action was an example of a peaceful protest. "" 'Hands up, don't shoot' is not just a Ferguson thing,"" Cook said. ""It's a worldwide thing. People are doing it in New York. People are doing it in Florida. People are doing it on the West Coast. It's not just about Ferguson. It's a message worldwide that for young adults that you can protest and you can do things peacefully without getting out of line.""

"Ebola patients fled during an attack at a health care facility in Monrovia, Liberia, on Saturday, Liberian National Police spokesman Sam Collins said. All patients who ran away had Ebola, Collins said. But some patients chose to stay at the facility.  And by Monday, some who left had returned, he said. Health workers were looking for the other patients. No one was injured in the incident, Collins said.  The assailants were using weapons but not wielding guns.  They stole mattresses and equipment, Collins said. ""It was an attack from people afraid of Ebola,"" Collins told CNN. ""Everybody is afraid."" Since an Ebola epidemic was declared in Guinea in March, the disease has spread to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria. Ebola can be contracted by coming into contact with infected organs and body fluids such as blood, saliva, urine and other secretions. In the deadly disease's current outbreak in those countries, 712 people have died from Ebola and 1,310 people are Liberia confirmed to be infected with the virus, the World Health Organization reports. Tolbert Nyenswah, Liberia's assistant minister of health, told CNN that as of Friday, 154 people in the nation have died from Ebola. There are more cases in which patients are suspected to have the disease, but that information has not been confirmed, he said. Last week, Liberia's government said that sample doses of ZMapp, an experimental drug used to treat two American health care workers in Atlanta, Georgia, would be sent to Liberia to treat doctors who have contracted the virus. The drug arrived and was given to three doctors, Nyenswah told CNN. He said the Liberian government is in talks to try to get more. The country had requested the drug, and the White House and U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved it. ZMapp has not been tested for public use. Earlier, the company that makes ZMapp said its supply was exhausted after fulfilling a request of a West African country which it did not, at the time, name. Liberia has taken other measures to try to contain the virus. In late July, it closed most of its borders and national campaigns have been launched to educate the public about how Ebola is spread and what to do if someone comes into contact with an infected person. On Sunday, Cameroon's information minister told CNN that the country was closing its border with Nigeria over Ebola concerns. Issa Tchiroma Bakari said that all flights to and from Nigeria into and out of Cameroon are suspended. People in Cameroon and Nigeria cross borders daily for commercial and personal reasons.

"The Western Australian government caught 172 sharks, and killed 50 of the largest animals, as part of a culling program that has sparked anger among conservationists. The three-month program, which ended last week, used baited lines attached to floating drums to catch sharks off popular beaches in Western Australia following a spate of fatal shark attacks in waters off the state in recent years. The scheme, which was part of the state's $20 million shark mitigation policy, allowed for tiger, bull and great white sharks measuring longer than 10 feet (3 meters) hooked on the drum lines to be destroyed. Some 50 tiger sharks longer than 10 feet were killed between January 25 and April 30. The largest one, which measured 14.8 feet (4.5 meters), was caught in February off Perth's Floreat beach. Not the right culprits? But none of the creatures captured were great white sharks, the species believed to be responsible for most of  the recent fatal attacks in Western Australia, which have left seven people dead in the past three years. Under the program, another 14 sharks measuring less than 10 feet died on the drum line and four more were destroyed because they were too weak to survive, according to the government's figures published Wednesday. Western Australia's Fisheries Minister Ken Baston hailed the shark mitigation policy a success, saying it was restoring confidence among beachgoers and contributing to research about shark behavior. ""The human toll from shark attacks in recent years has been too high,"" Baston said in a statement released to the media. ""While of course we will never know if any of the sharks caught would have harmed a person, this government will always place greatest value on human life,"" the minister said. Conservationist's nightmare . But the scheme has been criticized by environmentalists who say the sea predators should remain protected species. ""Of the 172 sharks that were caught on the drum line, the majority were tiger sharks which haven't been involved in shark fatalities for decades in Western Australia,"" Sea Shepherd shark campaigner Natalie Banks told CNN. More than 70% of the creatures caught on the drum line weren't large enough to be considered a threat or were other animals, like stingrays, Banks said. While monitoring the government program, Sea Shepherd found that sharks released alive were in a ""state of shock"" known as tonic immobility and sank to the ocean floor, she said. Hi-tech initiative . As part of its shark research and protection policy, the Western Australian Department of Fisheries is working on a satellite-linked shark tagging program that allows beach safety authorities to know, through near real-time alerts, if a tagged shark is in the vicinity. Under the three-month cull scheme, 90 sharks were tagged before being released alive. Other animals caught on the line were freed, including seven stingrays and a north-west blowfish. Beach closures due to shark sightings were also down this year, according to government figures. There were 93 closures in 2013-14, compared to 131 the previous season.

"President Barack Obama might soon find himself in a quandary in which basic arithmetic prevents him from faithfully executing all of the laws Congress has passed. The debt ceiling statute prohibits borrowing enough money to make up the difference between funds in the Treasury and legal obligations to spend. Anything the president does would violate some law. Indeed, anything he does would be unconstitutional because all of the relevant powers -- spending, taxing and borrowing -- belong to Congress. Many Washington insiders have assumed that if Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling, Obama could simply cut spending.  But constitutional history says otherwise. When President Richard Nixon tried to ""impound"" money that Congress had ordered him to spend, the courts slapped him down. During Bill Clinton's administration, the Supreme Court ruled that the president has only a limited ability to cut spending even with congressional authorization. He has no constitutional power to cut spending without such authorization. If every action the president might plausibly take would usurp a power of Congress, what should he do? He should minimize the usurpation. During the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln unilaterally suspended habeas corpus. Lincoln argued that if that decision was unconstitutional, it was nonetheless necessary to avoid a greater evil: violating his constitutional oath to defend the Union. Faced with a dilemma, Lincoln chose the less unconstitutional course. The same goes for this president from Illinois. If Congress creates a trilemma, he must choose the least unconstitutional option. Some commentators suggest that the Treasury could generate $2 trillion for the government by minting two platinum coins, using an obscure law that was enacted for the express purpose of creating memorabilia. But doing so would be economically equivalent to borrowing $2 trillion and thus, even if technically legal, would violate the substance of the debt ceiling law. In a constitutional crisis, analysis should rest on constitutional principles, not technicalities. The core issue is separation of powers: What course of action would minimize the executive taking over legislative authority? The answer is violating the debt ceiling, not cutting spending or raising taxes. By borrowing exactly enough money to cover the difference between funds in the Treasury and expenditures required by law, the president would simply be implementing Congress' budget. By contrast, a presidential decision to raise taxes or cut spending would require many policy-laden judgments: Whose taxes would be raised and by how much? What expenditures would be cut, to what degree and according to what criteria? For the president to make these quintessentially legislative judgments on his own would usurp power on an enormous scale. Issuing debt beyond the debt ceiling would be unconstitutional but not as unconstitutional as raising taxes or cutting spending. Despite some confusion, Obama has kept the least unconstitutional option on the table. In December, White House press secretary Jay Carney said that the ""administration does not believe that the 14th Amendment gives the president the power to ignore the debt ceiling."" That observation is beside the point. True, some scholars argue that the debt ceiling violates Section 4 of the 14th Amendment. If so, then the debt ceiling is void and the president's power to borrow money comes, not from the 14th Amendment, but from the statute authorizing the Treasury secretary to ""borrow on the credit of the United States government amounts necessary for expenditures authorized by law."" Putting aside the 14th Amendment, Carney's claim at most shows that unilaterally raising the debt ceiling would override Congress' borrowing authority. But that merely states one horn of the trilemma. Unilaterally raising taxes or cutting spending would usurp more congressional authority. Our leaders can still act responsibly by raising the debt ceiling or, better yet, by repealing it entirely. Congress can then control federal debt simply by paying attention to the gap between spending and taxes.  It should not force the president to usurp one of its powers. But if Congress leaves the president no constitutional options, he must choose the least unconstitutional one: borrowing money beyond the debt ceiling.","Writers: Debt ceiling puts Obama in a trap; executing law means violating others .
A president cannot authorize spending, taxing or borrowing to avoid ceiling, they say .
Writers: He should borrow exactly enough money to implement Congress' budget .
That move would be the least unconstitutional solution to his ""trilemma,"" they say ."
"Twitter is getting into e-commerce. It's now possible to buy goods online in two steps by tweeting a special hashtag. The new collaboration between Twitter and American Express will turn the social media service into a shopping cart. American Express members who sign up will be able to buy products by mentioning the appropriate hashtag in a tweet. The @AmexSync account will tweet back with a confirmation hashtag. Once you tweet that confirmation hashtag, American Express will shoot you a confirmation e-mail and give you 15 minutes to confirm you want the product. Your card will be charged and the goods shipped to your billing address. The two companies announced the partnership on Monday and kicked it off with a single product offering, a $25 American Express gift card for $15. Other products will be available starting Wednesday morning. To start Twitter shopping you'll need to first sync your American Express card with Twitter. The service will only work with compatible American Express cards (no prepaid or corporate cards) and a public Twitter account. Since protected accounts aren't allowed, there's no way to take advantage of a discount without it being public information. That means each purchase is not only money for the various companies involved, but also an automatic promotion for the product and its brands. The first discounted products American Express will sell are an Amazon Kindle Fire, a Sony Action cam, a Donna Karan-designed bracelet and an Xbox 360. Though various companies will tweet out the hashtags, all official product offers will be collected under the American Express Favorites section. This is not the first time American Express has experimented with social media. Its Amex Sync  program, launched last March, offers discounts on Twitter, Foursquare, Facebook and Xbox Live. On Twitter, you tweet the hashtag for an offer and then go make the purchase in person or through a separate online store. The discount is then applied to your American Express account within eight weeks. Social networks have been working hard to break into e-commerce. Facebook announced Facebook Gifts, which lets users make purchases for friends directly through the social network. Buying products this way is a unique case. Because it's for select discounted products, many of which will only be available for a set period, tweet-buying is not for people who are searching for a specific product or comparison shopping. It has much more in common with flash sales sites like Fab than e-commerce mainstays like Amazon. By wrapping the entire purchasing process in a hashtag, the service makes buying fast and easy. If it takes off, we could see hashtags for products in commercials and print ads.","Twitter and American Express team up to let cardholders buy products with a hashtag .

"New York (CNN) -- It took four trips by a state police helicopter, but 21 people who had been stranded by post-Irene floodwaters in a Prattsville, New York, house were rescued Monday without incident, a local official said. The group included four young children and a woman who appeared to be about five months pregnant, according to Greene County Administrator Shaun Groden. The group was stranded at a house that was cut off when all the bridges near it were washed out after torrential rains flooded homes and businesses and left the Catskill Mountains town of Prattsville largely cut off from the outside world. Another group of some 60 people took shelter during the storm at the Huntersfield Christian Training Center in Prattsville, and about 40 people remained there Monday night. Some in the group were able to head home on Monday, according to George Williams, youth leader at the center, but for others such a return would have to wait. ""We're in safe ground so that's why we're a refuge for those,"" Williams said. ""We have a number of people that have gone back to their homes, but we understand that there is a lot of, at your own risk, where people are entering their homes and they believe that they're sound ... but some homes have shifted ... and there's just a lot of cleanup to do,"" he added. ""There are some here that have nothing to go back to, so they don't know how long it's going to be."" The shelter, which Williams said was about five or six miles from Prattsville's main street, had power generators and enough water for those there to swap it for food from nearby residents. People from the neighboring town of Windham brought food and clothes for those at the shelter, Williams said. Emergency workers rescued 87 people from the Prattsville area on Sunday, including 25 people who were stranded at a motel for hours after 70 mph wind gusts grounded aircraft. The area flooded when Schoharie Creek rose more than 15 feet in less than 12 hours and intense rainfall shedding off the Catskills sent a volume of water greater than that of Niagara Falls -- both the American and Canadian sides -- crashing through town, Groden said. Elsie Stuppert, an employee of the Hideaway Hotel in Prattsville, said Monday the situation was dire. ""People can't go home. They have nothing, floors all mud, car on top of the deck. They've lost everything,"" she said. The hotel sheltered about 35 or 40 people Sunday night, and also served as a makeshift command post for rescue personnel. The town had been filled with vacationers, as well as people who headed to vacation homes in the area as they heeded warnings to evacuate parts of New York that forecasters had expected to bear the brunt of Irene's impact, said Williams, from the Huntersfield center. ""They had come up to escape the storm only to find its worst here,"" he said. CNN's Nina Golgowski, Maria P. White and Katie Silver contributed to this report.","NEW: Police helicopter rescues 21 people stranded in a house cut off by floodwaters .

"What do you think of Edward Snowden? By leaking classified documents to the media and revealing that the National Security Agency has been monitoring our phone and Internet usage, is he a traitor or a hero? Could he simply be a narcissist looking to get famous?  Or do you not care about either him or the NSA surveillance programs? Chris Cuomo, co-host of the new CNN morning show, ""New Day,"" joined us to discuss the top issues in this week's episode of ""The Big Three"" podcast. (Be sure to tune in to ""New Day,"" which premieres on Monday June 17 at 6 a.m. ET.) I must note that while I disagreed with Cuomo's view on Snowden, as a fellow graduate of Fordham Law School, his logic and comedy chops were impeccable. It's something we share and that distinguishes me from my co-hosts Margaret Hoover and John Avlon.  (At least that's what I keep telling myself.) Back to Edward Snowden.  A poll this week found that 31% of Americans consider him a patriot while 23% view him as a traitor. But a whopping 46% say they don't know. Is it because these 46% simply aren't following the story or because they have accepted government surveillance as the price for security? The Snowden Index: A glance at opinions about the NSA leaker . As Cuomo pointed out, Americans have ""matured"" since 9/11 over the issue of government surveillance.  Consequently, he believes that many do accept increased monitoring if it means that we can prevent another 9/11 or Boston Marathon bombing. But to me, ""we the people"" have a right to know when our government is spying on us, especially when officials like James Clapper, the director of National Intelligence, denied such a program existed when asked about it under oath by Congress just a few months ago. How else can we hold our government accountable if we aren't informed of its actions? To listen to this week's podcast, click on the Soundcloud audio player on this page or find us on iTunes. The second issue we discuss this week will hopefully outrage and disgust you as much as it did us.  There are few things that unite the left and right in America (or Margaret, John and I for that matter) but charities taking advantage of the sympathy and good will of Americans did just that. CNN teamed up with The Tampa Bay Times to reveal the 50 worst charities in America. Anyone considering donating money to a charity needs to first check out this list. These charities have raised millions of dollars pulling on the heartstrings of Americans by claiming to help children dying of cancer, disabled veterans, the less fortunate and others in need. What are they really doing? Only giving pennies on the dollar to those they purport to assist while keeping 80% to 90% of the money raised for administrative costs -- such as paying their officers. We also highlighted some of the best charities in America, including the YMCA, Goodwill and the new ""Dean Obeidallah charity,"" where I pledge to use 100% of the money raised to help me, Dean Obeidallah. Finally, we turned to erotic books and the CIA. No, the CIA hasn't started secretly spying on people who read erotica or investigating whether the ""Letters to Penthouse"" are real.  As the Daily Beast reported, the CIA's new No. 2 person, Avril Danica Haines, once co-owned a bookstore where she featured ""Erotica nights"" during which she and her guests would read aloud racy portions of books. John and Margaret applauded this as showing a human side to Haines as well as making the point that women in power can also be sexual beings.  However, my view is that this type of story typifies why it's so difficult for women to navigate up the government and corporate ladder. Those are our views. More importantly, we would love to hear your views on the three issues featured in this week's episode of ""The Big Three."" Plus, follow us on Twitter, we are all needy -- me especially.","Chris Cuomo, co-host of new CNN show, ""New Day"" chimes in on this week's podcast .

"(CNN) -- It didn't take a rocket scientist to predict that NASA's plan to pay Russia to launch American astronauts into orbit wasn't going to turn out well. Three years after NASA retired the space shuttle program, relations between the United States and Russia are worse than at any point since the end of the Cold War. Americans have reportedly been paying Russia $70 million a seat to send our astronauts to the International Space Station. That's three and a half times what the Russians charge private space tourists for the same ride on their 1960s-era spacecraft. Now Russian President Vladimir Putin is reconstituting the Russian empire, and senior Russian officials have reacted to our economic sanctions by suggesting that Americans ""bring their astronauts to the International Space Station using a trampoline."" NASA and our elected officials are to blame for this embarrassment. NASA has tried to replace the shuttle on its own before resorting to the commercial industry -- programs that were canceled after ludicrous cost overruns and technical setbacks. And worse, politicians and bureaucratic backscratchers repeatedly undermined the nascent commercial space industry, where new American companies are working to do less expensively what NASA was failing to do itself: develop a spacecraft capable of carrying humans into orbit. Instead of accelerating the creation of a thriving commercial space industry, NASA's second choice -- after its own program failed -- was to pay the Russian government rather than American companies for tickets into orbit. But now that NASA's funding of the Russian space program has become unattractive politically, its 4-year-old program to hire American companies to send crew to the International Space Station takes on new importance. On Tuesday, NASA announced the winners of its ""commercial crew"" competition. Which of the entrants did the agency award for the biggest contract? Was it SpaceX, a new leader in commercial spaceflight, which has gone from startup to multibillion dollar company in just over a decade, spent hundreds of millions of private investment designing and building three new rockets and a human-rated space capsule, completed more than a dozen launches and lined up dozens more for commercial customers, and proved itself more cost effective than its larger competition? Was it Sierra Nevada, another private company that has developed a small, winged space plane that lands passengers returning to Earth comfortably on runways, rather than sending them hurdling into the ocean -- giving the design a unique commercial potential? No. The largest contract in a program designed to boost competition within the commercial space industry went to Boeing -- the gigantic, heavily subsidized government contractor with a history of huge cost overruns. Although SpaceX did win a smaller prize of its own, the fact that the old incumbent is getting a contract to provide services to the space station is going to limit the promise of America's commercial space industry. But worse, despite committing to purchase some of these services from Boeing and SpaceX, NASA is still reportedly at work on its own, vastly more expensive design, the Space Launch System, in which Boeing is also involved. To anyone who isn't a NASA employee, a NASA contractor or a U.S. senator with a protected workforce in his state, this makes no sense. NASA should not be developing its own proprietary version of capabilities it could purchase commercially at much lower cost, especially when we know the agency's bureaucratic tendencies will be to view the commercial versions as competitors to kill. Instead, Congress should kill the NASA version and require the agency to purchase basic launch services from companies such as SpaceX, Sierra Nevada, and even Boeing -- if it can make its designs cost-competitive. Commercial space advocates in Congress have been trying to do this for years, but bureaucracies -- both government agencies and their giant contractors -- are extraordinarily adept at protecting themselves and their interests. In addition, Congress should hold hearings on why NASA selected such an expensive proposal for its commercial crew program when potentially cheaper, more innovative designs were available. Tuesday's announcement was a modest step forward for the commercial space industry, since it will mark the first time NASA has bought tickets from American companies to send astronauts into space. But NASA will need to embrace new entrants and promote a lot more competition to make sure this one small step for NASA isn't one giant leap backward on the taxpayer dime.","NASA missed a chance to back cheaper, more innovative design in new contract, Newt Gingrich says .

"(CNN) -- Richard Chavez, who dedicated more than three decades to the the farm worker movement, died Wednesday of complications from surgery in Bakersfield, California, the United Farm Workers union announced. He was 81. The younger brother of UFW founder Cesar Chavez, Richard Chavez was the one who designed the black Aztec eagle that became the famous symbol for the organization. The Chavez brothers grew up during the Depression outside of Yuma, Arizona, and when the family lost their farm, they became migrant farm workers in California fields, according to the UFW. By the early 1960s, Richard Chavez began helping his brother create the foundation for the union, and by 1966 was working full-time for the movement, the UFW said on its website Wednesday. ""Throughout his years of service, Richard fought for basic labor rights but also worked to improve the quality of life for countless farm workers,"" President Barack Obama said in a statement Thursday. ""Richard understood that the struggle for a more perfect union and a better life for all America's workers didn't end with any particular victory or defeat, but instead required a commitment to getting up every single day to keep at it."" According to the UFW, Richard Chavez, who was also a carpenter, oversaw construction or helped build important parts of the union's ""Forty Acres"" complex outside of Delano, California. ""Richard retired from the union in 1983, but always remained very active with the movement, fulfilling public speaking engagements and serving as an active board member of both the Cesar Chavez Foundation and Dolores Huerta Foundation,"" the UFW said. Cesar Chavez died in 1993.","He dedicated more than 30 years to the movement .

"How could it happen here?  This is the question plaguing residents of Newtown, Conn., a picture-perfect country town with good schools, quiet streets and a strong sense of community.  But small towns like Newtown are where 60% of rampage school shootings in the United States occur.  Far from big urban centers where gun violence is common, these communities are generally very safe.  But more often than not, they are the places where this kind of tragedy strikes. My research team spent two years trying to understand rampage school shootings.  We spent several months in Kentucky and Arkansas, in two towns that had been the scenes of shootings in the late 1990's. We interviewed  the shooters' neighbors,  friends, instructors, coaches and Sunday school teachers. We talked to people who had observed the shooters in jail cells right after the shootings, and years later in prison.  We combed the records of every shooting of this kind in the U.S. from the 1970s onward, looking for patterns.  And while each tragedy has its own anatomy,  a picture emerged that makes sociological sense and probably has some bearing on the Newtown case. Opinion: Put reason back in America's gun debate . Rampage shootings are never spontaneous.  They are planned, often for months in advance. We don't know yet whether the Newtown shooter, Adam Lanza, gave any warnings, but in the episodes we studied, shooters commonly  told their peers  -- often in a veiled and ambiguous fashion -- what they had  in mind. One reason shooters tip their hands is that they are trying to solve a problem.  Though they are often intelligent, high-performing boys, their peers tend to see them as unattractive losers, weak and unmanly. In a school culture that values sports prowess over academic accomplishment, they face  rejection.  The shooters are rarely loners, but tend instead to be failed joiners, and their daily social experience is full of friction.  Since they are almost always mentally or emotionally ill, those rejections -- so common in adolescence -- take on greater importance and become a fixation.  Rebuffed after trying to join friendship groups, they look for ways to gain attention, to reverse their damaged identities. The shooting is the last act in a long drama: a search for acceptance and recognition.  The  earlier acts fail miserably.    But once a shooter starts to talk about killing people, ostracism can turn to inclusion.  Suddenly, he is getting the attention he has been craving.  Michael Carneal, who killed three high school girls and paralyzed a fourth when he was a freshman in a Kentucky high school, pulled pranks, told loud silly jokes and stole CD's in an attempt to impress.  None of it worked.  But the day he started talking about shooting people, that began to change.  The Goth group he desperately wanted to join wheeled in his direction for the first time. Carneal never thought about how his actions would destroy lives or send his neighbors into a lifetime of angry mourning.  Interviewed after the shooting, he said he thought that those boys would at last become his friends. He would be asked over to their houses and they would visit him.  He would be cool. He was a skinny 13-year-old with glasses, a bright boy fond of reading and terrible at football --  all he was after was another identity. Opinion: Mourn...and take action on guns . Look at photos of Seung-Hui Cho, the shooter at Virginia Tech who murdered 32 people, and you will  see eerie echoes of what Lanza reportedly wore: mask, military fatigues, multiple guns in assault position.  Many of these young men are trying to cast themselves as stars of a movie that ends in a blaze of suicidal gunfire and notoriety. Our research on earlier shootings showed the attack is on a school because  that is the center  stage in a small town, where  the young men can rivet the entire community . If so many clues are out there, why don't more people see them?  High-school teachers see students less than an hour a day, and rarely compare notes with other teachers, even after witnessing troubling behavior. They often do not document infractions, preferring to address problems in their own classrooms. Peers, on the other hand, do hear things.  Why don't they come forward? Opinion: Parents' promise: I will keep you safe . First, the signal is noisy.  Michael Carneal was always saying goofy things.  He explained to his would-be friends that they would see who ""lived or died on Monday.""   Mitchell Johnson, who, together with Andrew Golden, killed four kids and a teacher in an Arkansas middle school, told his friends that he would be ""running from the cops.""   They recognized in hindsight that he was telegraphing his intentions.   But at the time, most didn't know what to make of these comments.  A few students took Michael Carneal's warnings so seriously that they didn't go to school that fateful Monday.    But none of the dozens of kids in either school who heard veiled threats reported them to adults. They didn't know how to interpret the signals.  In the context of goofball comments they were used to, how could they know these were real warnings?  Crossing the DMZ that separates kids from adults in early adolescence is socially dangerous.  Why risk being deemed a tattletale or teacher's pet when you don't know whether those crazy asides actually mean anything? This quandary is the root of preventing rampage shootings in schools.  Law enforcement will never be able to respond fast enough to stop shootings that often end in seconds.  This is why we have to find ways for people who hear troubling rumors or threats to report them to people who can investigate and intervene.  And while we do not know enough now to tell whether anyone had a clue about Adam Lanza's murderous intentions, it will not come as a shock if it turns out there were people in his social orbit who had an inkling, fuzzy and incredible as that inkling might be.  It would fit the pattern of what we saw in virtually all of the other rampage shootings in American schools. Opinion: Has life in America gone insane? Would gun control help?  Yes and no.  Yes, because anything that thwarts the efforts of a Carneal or a Johnson to get their hands on guns will make it harder to perpetrate a massacre and will deter the ambivalent.   If Adam Lanza had had to go to greater lengths to get his hands on weapons, he might have run out of psychic energy to do this terrible deed.  It appears he had little trouble, though, because the guns belonged to his mother, were registered and legally owned.  Why in the world we enable civilians to own such lethal instruments baffles millions of citizens and will be the subject of a searching debate if our politicians can get over the barriers that have prevented serious reform. But gun control is not enough.  A  determined person will find a way.  Andrew Golden and Mitchell Johnson took a blow torch to a safe to try to get at the guns they knew were hidden there.  That failed, so they found wire clippers and managed to cut their way through the cables that were supposed to keep Golden's grandfather's gun collection out of the wrong hands.  People who are this intent on getting their hands on weapons are very difficult to stop.  That is not an argument against gun control because thousands of unbalanced young men are not quite that determined; they are ambivalent.  That is why gun control is a necessary but not sufficient step. Although we will not be able to stop all of these tragedies, we can cut down on their number by insuring that adults make themselves available to kids in completely confidential settings, reassuring them of their privacy when they take that risky step to come forward.  We can provide opportunities for ""round pegs"" like Michael Carneal, a bright, intellectually inclined kid, to find a social space that doesn't depend on athletic prowess or a handsome face. If the reports of his childhood acquaintances prove to be correct, Adam Lanza may have been through a similar experience.   Kids can be very cruel and they are not always courageous enough to own up to their culpability for ostracism, particularly since they don't know -- and cannot be held responsible -- for the extreme consequences of emotional damage they may be causing. In the end, though, there will be troubled boys and some of them will become killers.  To the extent that we can capture the warning signals they send out to their peers, we can do our best to stop them in their tracks, even if we do not always succeed.

"Forty-five years after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a ban on interracial marriage, the rate of marriage across racial and ethnic lines in the United States is on the rise, according to a new study released Thursday. And while such ""intermarriages"" continue to grow, so too does public acceptance of such unions, according to the study by the Pew Research Center's Social and Demographic Trends project. The study has left social media sites abuzz with discussion. ""Why do people give inter-racial dating so much lip service?"" wrote Tosin Lajuwomi on Twitter. ""You like who you like - black, white, blue, orange."" Others were more reserved about what the report reflects. ""I look forward to the day when stories about ""inter-racial"" marriages are no longer newsworthy,"" wrote James Burns on the micro-blogging site. ""We have far to go."" About 15% of new marriages in the United States in 2010 were between spouses of different races or ethnicities, more than doubling the 1980 level of 6.7%, according to the study. Looking at all married couples in 2010, regardless of when they married, so-called ""intermarriages"" reached an all-time high of 8.4% in 2010, compared to 3.2% in 1980, the study said. The study analyzed the demographic and characteristics of newlyweds who differ in race or ethnicity and compared them to couples of the same race or ethnicity. It defines newly weds as couples who married in the year prior to the survey date. Among all newlyweds in 2010, 9% of whites married outside of their race or ethnicity, along with 17% of African-Americans, 26% of Hispanics and 28% of Asians -- a term that includes native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders. Gender patterns in intermarriages vary widely, the study found. About 24% of African-American males married outside their race in 2010, compared to 9% of African-American females. However, the reverse is true for Asians, where about 36% of females married outside their race compared to 17% of male newlyweds. And intermarriages for white and Hispanic people do not vary by gender, researchers found. Intermarriages also vary by region. In Western states, about one in five people, or 22%, married someone of a different race or ethnicity between 2008 and 2010. That drops to 14% in the South, 13% in the Northeast and 11% in the Midwest. Interracial dating services have also cropped up online, offering those looking for love an opportunity to find their preferred matches. A white man identified as Christopher on the website ""Interracial Dating Central,"" said that he saw who would turn out to be his future wife online. ""Be bold, ladies,"" said Cassandra, an African-American woman and Christopher's wife, according to the website. ""Have patience, and then have nerve when that patience pays off!"" Because whites are by far the nation's largest racial group, marriage between whites and minorities were the most common type of intermarriage, even though the intermarriage rate for whites is relatively low compared to other races or ethnicities, the study said. The state where most intermarriages took place was Hawaii, where more than four in 10 newlyweds (42.4%) were intermarried. The next highest percentages were in Oklahoma, Nevada and New Mexico, with 26.3%, 25.6% and 25.4%, respectively. Comparing those who ""married out"" to those who ""married in,"" researchers found the median combined earnings of both groups were similar. In one in five marriages of each group, both spouses were college graduates. In both groups, people tended to marry someone of a similar age, with a two- to three-year age gap between husband and wife. Additionally, equal numbers were marrying for the first time. However, there were some differences. White/Asian newlywed couples had significantly higher median combined annual earnings, at $70,592, than any other pairing. And ""when it comes to educational characteristics, more than half of white newlyweds who marry Asians have a college degree, compared with roughly a third of white newlyweds who married whites,"" the study said. Hispanic or African-Americans who married whites tended to have higher educational attainment compared to marriages within their own race or ethnic group. Couples formed between an Asian man and a white wife topped the median combined earnings list for the period studied, between 2008 and 2010, with about $71,800, the study said. ""During this person, white male newlyweds who married Asian, Hispanic or black spouses had higher combined earnings than did white male newlyweds who married a white spouse."" Several studies using government data have found overall divorce rates are higher for couples who ""married out,"" the Pew Center said, ""but here, too, the patterns vary by the racial and gender characteristics of the couples. Meanwhile, about 43% of Americans said they believe more intermarriages is a change for the better within society, while only about one in 10 said it was a change for the worse, the Pew Center said. ""Being a minority, younger, more educated, liberal and living in the Eastern or Western states are all traits associated with those who think more positively about intermarriage,"" according to the study. More than one-third of adults surveyed said an immediate family member or close relatives is married to someone of a different race, the study said. And nearly two-thirds, or 63%, said they would have no problem with a family member marrying someone outside their own racial or ethnic group. In a 1986 survey, nearly three in 10 Americans said intermarriage was not acceptable for anyone, and 37% said it might be acceptable for others, but not for themselves. Only one-third of the public said it was acceptable for everyone in the 1986 poll. The study is primarily based on the Pew Center's analysis of data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Service in 2008-2010 and on three nationwide telephone surveys, the study said.","Inter-ethnic or interracial marriages reaches an all time high in 2010 .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Closing arguments are set for Wednesday in the trial of Mexican soap opera actress Fernanda Romero on federal charges that her marriage was an illegal sham intended only to earn her a U.S. work permit. On Tuesday, Romero tearfully testified that she really loved Kent Ross, the pizza deliveryman she married five years ago. Their marriage was real, but it soon fell apart because of his drinking and her focus on a modeling and acting career, Romero told jurors. Romero is accused of paying Ross $5,000 to marry her on June 12, 2005, but the prosecutor alleged they never lived together as a couple. U.S. District Judge Manuel Real blocked defense lawyers from using evidence they said would show Romero was set up and turned in by a vengeful photographer angry that she rebuffed his romantic advances. The job of convincing jurors the marriage was real fell on Romero, a 28-year-old actress-singer-model who starred in Telemundo's ""Wounded Soul"" soap opera. The prosecutor suggested Romero was using her professional acting skills to sell her own fiction. Romero testified she married for love, not a green card. ""To be in a loving relationship, forever and ever, like my parents,"" she testified. The couple didn't have a family wedding because he is Mormon and she is Catholic, she said. They kept separate Hollywood apartments because he couldn't break a lease and she traveled a lot, she said. The first months were ""very loving, fun,"" she said. ""We socialized together, passionate. It was the honeymoon stage."" Romero and Ross separated after less than a year together because ""he was coming on very late and drunk,"" she said. ""We started to fight a lot, sweat a lot, throw things. It was not healthy."" The villain in Romero's script would be Markus Klinko, a celebrity photographer she met at a Hollywood casting call about the same time her marriage was ""on the rocks,"" she said. Klinko, a 49-year-old Swiss native, is the star of his own reality TV show -- Bravo's ""Double Exposure."" Romero said the relationship initially was ""professional and creative,"" but she eventually engaged in a ""short affair"" with Klinko as he helped with her modeling career. ""I felt very pressured and I was vulnerable,"" Romero said as she cried. ""It was the biggest mistake I've done in my life."" Her friendship with Klinko turned into a nightmare when she decided to end the affair, she said. ""Mr. Klinko wanted more and more and he knew I wasn't able to give it to him,"" she said. Klinko threatened to turn her in to immigration officials, she said. ""He was losing it, he was very psycho,"" Romero said. ""I was very scared, because he wouldn't stop."" The federal complaint against Romero said the immigration investigation began after agents were given evidence gathered by a private detective hired by Klinko. When Klinko testified for the prosecution last week he said it was ""completely incorrect"" that his motivation was to get Romero deported. Instead, the investigator was gathering evidence to be used in a lawsuit against Michael Ball, the founder and owner of the Rock & Republic fashion company, Klinko said. The criminal complaint named Ball as a target of the federal investigation, alleging that he helped arrange the sham marriage while Romero was modeling for his company. Klinko said his lawyer turned the evidence over to the government only because he feared Klinko might be extorted by Ball. ""My case has never been against Fernanda,"" Klinko said after his testimony. ""I wish her the best."" Ross, 28, also had his turn on the witness stand Tuesday, hoping to convince jurors that he and Romero were a real couple at one time. ""I was in love with her,"" Ross testified. ""It felt right at the time, so I rolled with it."" He was asked why he asked the actress to marry him after knowing her for only a short time. ""I had a tiger by the tail and I wanted to keep her here,"" he said. Romero and Ross sat directly in front of jurors throughout the one-week trial, holding hands much of the time. They could get between 15 and 21 months in prison if convicted, though such cases usually produce shorter sentences, according to the prosecutor. The case is unusual because marriage fraud charges are usually litigated by immigration authorities rather than prosecuted as criminal cases. Romero's show business career began in Mexico at age 16 when she joined the ensemble Frizzby, her Internet Movie Database biography says. The group toured Mexico and Central America, releasing two top-10 singles, it says. She started hosting television shows and appearing on commercials in Mexico when she was 18, it says. Romero has appeared in print and TV ad campaigns for Rock and Republic, Clean and Clear, Pepsi, Apple and JC Penney, it says. ""She was cast in Telemundo's original production 'Wounded Soul,' where she was not only a lead actress, but also a lead singer, performing two songs in the soap opera's soundtrack,"" her online biography says.","Fernanda Romero testifies in her own defense Tuesday .

"The Southwest heat wave made June the hottest month on record for Las Vegas, Death Valley, and Needles, California, the National Weather Service said Monday, which added that the high temperatures are not over yet. Forecasters extended the excessive heat warning in place for much of California, Nevada, and parts of Arizona through 11 p.m. on Independence Day, warning of ""dangerously hot temperatures."" Monday saw new record temperatures across the region. Death Valley hit 127 degrees, breaking the old record for the day by two degrees, said Chris Stachelski, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Las Vegas. Barstow, California, set a new daily record of 114, as did Bishop, California, where it reached 109. The hottest temperatures Monday were near Las Vegas and surrounding Clark County, Stachelski said. Moapa, Nevada, just northeast of Vegas, reached a high of 120. Five people were treated for heat-related illnesses over the weekend at Lake Mead, just east of Las Vegas, said Christie Vanover, a spokeswoman for the National Park Service. A man was found dead after falling down a ridge at the park, she said, after a visitor reported seeing him wandering in the desert. It's unclear whether the heat played a role in his death. Finding ways to cool off . The heat is causing a surge in business at Big Surf Waterpark in Tempe, Arizona, which saw big crowds over the weekend, said Greg Fresquez at the park's marketing office. Together with the Independence Day holiday in the middle of the week, the heat is expected to bring in even more visitors in the coming days, he said. Tony Orlowski, manager at Randy's Restaurant and Ice Cream in Scottsdale, Arizona, said customers all express the same complaint when they come in the door: ""It's hot out there."" ""We tell them, 'It's cool in here. Come in and cool off,'"" he said. Orlowski normally recommends a milkshake, a banana split or a couple of scoops of ice cream to take some of the sting out of the summer sun. Before they head out into the furnace, he advises, ""Don't catch a chill."" It's not going away . Civic and emergency officials throughout the Southwest say if there was ever a time to worry, this would be it. The reason isn't just the oppressive heat that is plaguing the region: It's the fact it is expected to hang around, and possibly even get worse, over the next few days. ""A very strong ridge of high pressure is centered over much of the western U.S.,"" CNN senior meteorologist Dave Hennen said. ""That high pressure causes sinking air, which becomes compressed and warms up and also dries out. This particular high pressure system remains stuck in the West, which has allowed the heat to build last week and through the weekend."" Making emergencies worse . More than 100 firefighters were called to a large fire Monday at a commercial building in Sun Valley, north of Los Angeles -- a blaze made worse by the heat, said Brian Humphrey of the Los Angeles City Fire Department. He told CNN affiliate KCAL/KCBS that with a high of 95 in Sun Valley, ""One of the problems we have is not only the heat from the fire, but also the ambient temperature."" The high temperatures northwest of Phoenix are complicating efforts to fight the 8,400-acre Yarnell Hill wildfire. That's where 19 members of an elite firefighting squad died Sunday when a wind shift and other factors caused the fire to become erratic, said Mike Reichling, Arizona State Forestry Division spokesman. Historically hot . The heat wave comes just a couple weeks before the 100th anniversary of what the National Weather Service calls the ""highest reliably recorded air temperature on Earth"" -- 134 degrees on July 10, 1913, in Death Valley's Greenland Ranch. The valley is consistently deemed the hottest location in the world because of its depth and shape. It has one of the world's lowest elevations and also serves as one of the driest locations in North America. Its 11,000-foot surrounding mountain range traps and radiates heat down into it. Heat hurts your insides too . Some advice . ""The No. 1 thing is to absolutely know your limitations and to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water,"" Chris Stachelski, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Las Vegas, advised those trying to cope with the high temperatures. He recommended limiting time outdoors. For those who have to do any strenuous activity outside, he advises doing it in the early morning, evening or simply putting it off until the end of the week when the temperatures are lower. Heat stroke symptoms include hallucinations, chills, confusion and dizziness, along with slurred speech. To protect against heat stress, the CDC advises spending time in air-conditioned places, staying informed of heat warnings and drinking lots of fluids. Don't forget the pets . The same advice goes for dogs, who can quickly develop heat stroke. ""Most of the time people didn't realize, it certainly was not intentional, and they bring them in very quickly when they realize that there is a problem,"" Brandi Garcia, a critical care specialist at Emergency Animal Clinic in Gilbert, Arizona, told CNN affiliate KNXV. Just like with their human friends, dogs do best with plenty of water and limited exposure to the high temperatures. Also, asphalt can burn your pet's paws.","June is the hottest month on record for Las Vegas and Death Valley .

"Paris, France (CNN) -- The French parliament begins debate Tuesday on a bill that would ban women from wearing Islamic veils, such as the burqa, that fully cover the face and body. A vote is not expected until next week, after which the measure, if passed, will go to the French Senate for a vote likely in the fall. The French Council of Ministers approved the measure in May, saying veils that cover the face ""cannot be tolerated in any public place."" Their approval sent the bill to parliament. The parliamentary debate starting Tuesday is the latest step in France's efforts to ban the burqa, niqab and other Muslim garments that cover a woman's face. A panel of French lawmakers recommended a ban last year, and lawmakers unanimously passed a non-binding resolution in May calling the full-face veil contrary to the laws of the nation. ""Given the damage it produces on those rules which allow the life in community, ensure the dignity of the person and equality between sexes, this practice, even if it is voluntary, cannot be tolerated in any public place,"" the French government said when it sent the measure to parliament in May. The bill envisions a fine of 150 euros ($190) and/or a citizenship course as punishment for wearing a face-covering veil. Forcing a woman to wear a niqab or a burqa would be punishable by a year in prison or a 15,000-euro ($19,000) fine, the government said, calling it ""a new form of enslavement that the republic cannot accept on its soil."" The measure would take effect six months after passage, giving authorities time to try to persuade women who veil themselves voluntarily to stop. The French Council of State has warned that the ban could be incompatible with international human rights law and the country's own constitution. The council advises on laws, but the government is not required to follow its recommendations. Amnesty International urged French lawmakers in May not to approve the ban. ""A complete ban on the covering of the face would violate the rights to freedom of expression and religion of those women who wear the burqa or the niqab in public as an expression of their identity or beliefs,"" said John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International's expert on discrimination in Europe. Belgium's lower house of parliament passed a similar ban in April. If that bill is approved by the upper house and signed into law, it will be the first national ban in Europe on the burqa, a full-body cover that includes a mesh over the face, and the niqab, a full-face veil that leaves an opening only for the eyes. The hijab, which tightly covers the hair and neck but not the face, and the chador, which covers the body but not the face, apparently would not be banned by either law. The Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life estimates that France has about 3.5 million Muslims, or about 6 percent of the population. France does not keep its own statistics on religious affiliation of the population, in keeping with its laws requiring the state to be strictly secular.","French law would bar women from covering faces with Islamic veils .

"Actor Peter O'Toole died peacefully Saturday in a hospital, his agent Steve Kenis said Sunday. He was 81. O'Toole's first major film role in the title role of T.E. Lawrence in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" in 1962 was ""absolute genius,"" British film critic Richard Fitzwilliams told CNN.  It earned him the first of eight Academy Award nominations and propelled him to world stardom. ""Ireland, and the world, has lost one of the giants of film and theatre,"" Irish President Michael D. Higgins said in a statement. Born in Ireland and raised in England, O'Toole's acting career began on stage in England as a teenager, moving later to television roles in the 1950s and then the big screen. ""His family are very appreciative and completely overwhelmed by the outpouring of real love and affection being expressed towards him, and to us, during this unhappy time,"" daughter Kate O'Toole said in an written statement.  ""Thank you all, from the bottom of our hearts."" Share your memories of O'Toole . O'Toole had ""been ill for some time,"" his daughter said. ""In due course there will be a memorial filled with song and good cheer, as he would have wished,"" she wrote. ""We will be happy to speak to you all then but in the meantime if you could give Peter O'Toole the respect he deserves and allow us to grieve privately we'd appreciate it."" ""On stage and screen, if their function is to reflect the human condition, then O'Toole did it absolutely brilliantly with his highs and lows and his remarkable ability to convey emotion,"" Fitzwilliams said.  ""He was so expressive, and his great triumph was undoubtedly 'Lawrence of Arabia.'"" O'Toole's portrayal of Lawrence was followed in 1964 by the role of King Henry II in ""Becket,"" opposite Richard Burton as Thomas Becket.  Both men were nominated for the best actor Oscar for the film, but both lost. Five of Peter O'Toole's best . The pattern of Oscar nominations, but no statuettes, for O'Toole is unmatched.   ""Always the bridesmaid, never the bride,"" he once said. GoldDerby.com writer Tom O'Neil said it was one of Hollywood's biggest mistakes, but that O'Toole took the oversight in stride. O'Toole was nominated for the best actor Oscar again for playing Henry II opposite Katharine Hepburn in the 1968 film ""The Lion in Winter."" His fourth Oscar nomination came in 1969 for the role of a shy English school teacher in ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips."" Although his portrayal of the 14th Earl of Gurney in the 1972 movie ""The Ruling Class"" was nominated for best actor, Fitzwilliams cited it as an example of O'Toole's overacting. ""He was an actor, admittedly, of uneven merit, but what you had was this phenomenal life force, almost a wayward genius,"" Fitzwilliams said. O'Toole's battle with an alcohol addiction hampered his career in the 1970s, but he staged a comeback with his 1980 leading role in ""The Stunt Man.""  It brought him a sixth best actor nomination from the Academy. He mocked his own image as an over-the-hill, alcoholic matinee idol in ""My Favorite Year"" (1982).  He was again nominated for best actor but did not win. O'Toole was presented an honorary Oscar by Meryl Streep during the 2003 Academy Awards.  The engraving on the gold statuette reads:  ""Whose remarkable talents have provided cinema history with some of its most memorable characters."" But he was not done. He was also nominated for the best actor Oscar for his role as an aging, out-of-work actor obsessed with a young woman in the 2006 film ""Venus.""

"The first leader in Egypt's history to win a democratic election is a study in contrasts: a strict Islamist educated in southern California, who vowed to stand for women's rights yet argued for banning them from the presidency. Mohamed Morsi, 60, was declared president Sunday after he took 52% of the vote to 48% for former Hosni Mubarak official Ahmed Shafik. During the historic campaign for president, Morsi said he would support democracy, women's rights and peaceful relations with Israel if he won. But has also argued called Israeli leaders ""vampires"" and ""killers."" One analyst describes him as an ""icon"" of those seeking an ""extreme agenda."" Morsi's biggest challenges . He was arrested several times under President Hosni Mubarak's regime for protesting ""repressive measures and oppressive practices,"" as well as ""rigged elections,"" his party said during the campaign. At one point, he spent seven months in jail. Thousands of people gathered in stifling hot temperatures in Cairo's Tahrir Square erupted in cheers following the announcement that he had won. Are you there? Share your images. Morsi leads the Freedom and Justice Party, the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood. Egypt's oldest and best-organized political movement, the Brotherhood won the largest share of seats in parliamentary elections earlier this year. But Egypt's highest court dissolved the legislature on June 14. Morsi focused his campaign on appealing to the broadest possible audience. But he ""represents the older, more conservative wing of the Brotherhood and openly endorses a strict Islamic vision,"" Isobel Coleman of the Council on Foreign Relations wrote in a column for CNN.com. A slogan associated with his campaign, ""Islam is the solution,"" sparked concerns that Morsi could introduce a fundamentalist Islamic theocracy. He told CNN during the campaign that he had no such plans. His party seeks ""an executive branch that represents the people's true will and implements their public interests,"" Morsi told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. Photos: Political turmoil in Egypt . ""There is no such thing called an Islamic democracy. There is democracy only. ... The people are the source of authority,"" he said. Asked about the role of women, he vowed that ""women's rights are equal to men."" And asked whether he would maintain Egypt's 1979 accord with Israel, Morsi answered, ""Yes, of course I will. I will respect it provided the other side keep it up and respect it."" Morsi was not originally his party's pick for the country's top post. He was called on to step in after the first choice was disqualified. Khairat al-Shater was among three candidates who were told they did not meet candidacy requirements. The Muslim Brotherhood had originally pledged not to seek the presidency, but the group reversed its decision as the election approached. Morsi has served as a central behind-the-scenes player for much of the past decade, Eric Trager of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy wrote in a column for The New Republic. He was the Brotherhood's primary point man for state security -- ""the repressive domestic security apparatus through which the Mubarak regime monitored and infiltrated opposition groups,"" Trager writes. ""Indeed, Brotherhood leaders trusted Morsi because they viewed him as ideologically rigid, and therefore unlikely to concede too much to the regime during negotiations."" Morsi was also ""an icon of the extremists in the Muslim Brotherhood,"" pushing for an ""extreme agenda,"" Trager wrote. Morsi's official biography on the Freedom and Justice Party website describes him as ""one of the most prominent political leadership figures of the Brotherhood, the organization that led the struggle against the ousted repressive regime in its last decade."" He led the Brotherhood's parliamentary bloc from 2000 to 2005 in addition to serving as president of the Department of Materials Science, Faculty of Engineering at Zagazig University. Morsi was arrested several times ""due to his constantly firm stance against the repressive measures and oppressive practices of the overthrown regime,"" the party said. ""After the 2005 elections were rigged, Dr. Mohamed Morsi led demonstrations in support for judges demanding independence, refusing referral of some judges to the Competence Commission to punish them for their outspoken views against blatant elections fraud."" The following May, he was among 500 members of the Brotherhood arrested, the party said. Morsi spent seven months behind bars. ""He was arrested, yet again, on the morning of the 'Friday of Anger' on January 28, 2011, during the revolution of January 25 along with a large number of Brotherhood leaders across Egypt. ... When several prisons were destroyed during the revolution, and many prisoners escaped, Dr. Morsi refused to leave his prison cell. Instead, he contacted satellite TV channels and news agencies demanding the judicial authorities visit the prison and check the legal position of jailed Muslim Brotherhood leaders, to clarify if there were indeed any legal reasons for their arrest,"" the party website says. Morsi declared Egypt's new president .","Thousands in Cairo's Tahrir Square erupt in cheers as Mohamed Morsi is named president .

"Ashraf Ghani was sworn in Monday as Afghanistan's President, sealing the country's first peaceful democratic transition of power. Ghani, a former finance minister, takes office after signing a power-sharing deal last week with his rival presidential candidate, Abdullah Abdullah. He succeeds Hamid Karzai, who experienced a rocky relationship with the United States during his 13 years in power that began after the fall of the Taliban. A reminder of the challenges facing Ghani and Afghanistan came a few miles away from the presidential palace in Kabul: A suicide bomber targeting a police checkpoint killed four police officers and three civilians Monday morning, said Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for the Afghan Interior Ministry. Elsewhere in Afghanistan, three suicide bombers killed four Afghan police officers Monday at a district police headquarters in the eastern Paktia province, Sediqqi said. Ghani and Abdullah had been locked in a lengthy dispute amid accusations of voting fraud and manipulation, raising fears of increased instability in the fragile, war-torn country. Under the agreement, Abdullah, a former foreign minister who later became a vocal critic of Karzai's, will take a newly created position of chief executive officer, which will have similar functions to a prime minister. The deal also calls for the two leaders' teams to share senior government positions equally. Some commentators have suggested the two rivals may have difficulty working together in government after months of bad blood between them. The political impasse in Afghanistan this year had come as the Taliban continued to mount deadly attacks on high-profile targets and fought fiercely for control of important areas. As the U.S.-led war effort against the militants winds down, most NATO troops are due to withdraw from Afghanistan by the end of this year.","Two attacks kill eight police on day new President takes the oath of office .

"Tackling the effects of climate change could cost governments around the world more than $100 billion a year, a United Nations panel of experts said Monday. A report by the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, says that a temperature rise of 2 degrees Celsius will wipe out up to 2% of the world's income by 2050. But it says the price tag could grow even higher if the world's governments fail to address the looming climate change. ""If we get up to 4 degrees temperature rise, which most scientists now expect would happen if we carry on emitting greenhouse gasses as we do, then the cost could be much more severe,"" Chris Hope, a climate change researcher at Cambridge University said. The combined cost of crop losses, rising sea levels, higher temperatures and fresh water shortages could mount of to between $70 and $100 billion a year, the report said. But these estimates do not account for catastrophic scenarios, which researchers said tend to have the most devastating effect. Typhoon Haiyan, which swept through Philippines in November, killed 6,000 people and cost more than $10 billion. When severe floods hit parts of the UK earlier this year, the Federation of Small Businesses estimated the overall cost to businesses to be $1.3 billion. And according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the 2012 drought -- the worst in 25 years -- pushed up poultry prices by 5.5% and egg prices by 7%. The report says crop yields will fall by 2% per decade, as the rising temperature affects some of the world's major crops -- such as rice, maze or wheat. Carbon dioxide benchmark hits new heights, worries scientists . Hope said that if people continue to emit greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, the bill will grow for everyone. ""It looks as though it's about $125 worth of extra impact for every one more ton of Carbon Dioxide we put in the atmosphere -- that comes up to around $0.20 per a liter of gasoline,"" he said. ""Businesses must expect that, if we are serious about climate change, at some point they are going to be charged that kind of money if they carry on using gas coal, oil, gas, fossil fuels which emit those kind of gasses to the atmosphere,"" he added. The report, released in Yokohama, Japan, is the second part of the IPCC's benchmark assessment of climate change, a document released every six years. Nearly 1,000 scientists contributed to it.

"Indiana and Montana have joined the growing list of states with confirmed cases of Enterovirus D68, health officials say. Four children in Lake County were sickened by Enterovirus D68 and were treated at University of Chicago Hospital, according to a press release from the Indiana Department of Health; all four have since been discharged from the hospital. Lake County is in the northwest corner of the state. Montana has one confirmed case of Enterovirus D68, says Jon Ebelt, a spokesman for the state's public health department. ""A specimen sent to the CDC from a child under the age of 10 has tested positive for the particular strain of enterovirus,"" he told CNN. Enteroviruses are very common, especially in the fall and winter months. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10 to 15 million infections occur in the United States each year. But this type of enterovirus -- Enterovirus D68 -- appears to be exacerbating breathing problems in children with asthma. These viruses usually present like the common cold; symptoms include sneezing, a runny nose and a cough. Most people recover without any treatment. But if your child appears to be having trouble breathing, take him or her to a doctor right away. As of September 11, the CDC had confirmed more than 80 cases of Enterovirus D68 in six states: Colorado, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky and Missouri. New York also announced on Friday that it had more than a dozen confirmed cases of the virus. The Indiana State Department of Health is keeping an eye out for additional cases of enterovirus. Hospitals are sending samples from patients with severe respiratory illnesses to a state laboratory for testing. Last week, media reports of kids flooding emergency rooms in Alabama and Washington state spoke to the spread of the virus. Other states, including Michigan, Georgia, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Utah, are also investigating clusters of respiratory illnesses. Several have sent samples to the CDC for testing. The virus is hard to track, as many enteroviruses cause similar symptoms, and hospitals generally do not test for specific types. But the CDC has asked hospitals around the country to send in samples if they suspect Enterovirus D68 has caused a patient's severe respiratory illness.

"Daniel Bradshaw, a young barber at Platinum Kutz in central Des Moines, hovers over a customer's half-trimmed head, clippers in hand, talking about the good old days of 2008. ""Yeah, I was all for Obama. He was the man!"" proclaimed Bradshaw, 32, whose friends call him ""Mr. Puerto Rico"" and whose colleagues sometimes refer to him as ""Mr. Steal-Your-Client.""  As he brushed the hair clippings off his apron, he goes on: ""I even got to meet him, once. He was all that."" Or so he thought. Bradshaw, like many of his fellow Democrats, feels let down. The promise, the hope, the dream of the first black president has stalled in the reality of a stubborn economy, two wars and a Congress engaged in full-contact politics. So this time around, come Election Day 2012, a frustrated Bradshaw says he might not vote at all. He's done with all of it. ""After all this, I just don't trust the government anymore. They're just playin' with people. What have they really done? Nothing, as far as I can see. I'm not going to vote at all this year. My wife, either, I've convinced her not to vote,"" lamented Bradshaw as he edged the hairline of his customer. ""I'm just disappointed. It's not even Obama. It's all of them. I've come to realize they're all the same. It doesn't matter if you're a Republican, it doesn't matter if you're Democrat, tea party, independent, whatever, it doesn't mater. They are all the same."" The feeling, though certainly not universal, is more and more echoed by frustrated and disengaged Democrats at gas stations and gyms, diners and coffee houses throughout Iowa. Disappointment and loyalty . While President Barack Obama's approval rating has rebounded recently, jumping back up 5 percentage points to 49% in the latest CNN/ORC International poll, the approval ratings for Congress are at all-time lows. In the same poll, only 16% say they approve of the job Congress is doing, with 83% giving lawmakers from both parties the thumbs down. Across Iowa, the state where then-U.S. Sen. Obama surprised the nation and swept the 2008 Democratic caucuses, igniting early momentum and propelling him to win his party's nomination over U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton, other Democrats are standing tall with the president, ready to fight to give him another term. ""He doesn't care about all that mess. They just haven't let him do his job. I have never seen so many politicians fighting so hard to take one man down. But he's fighting for all of us,"" said Robert ""Big Rob"" Presswood, co-owner of the barber shop that caters to judges, local politicians, police officers and downtown professionals. ""I think if they give him another shot, then he'll have enough time to change some things around."" ""He's our first black president. He did the unthinkable. And he's been amazing. Have you really looked at all that he has gotten done, despite those fools? And, on top of that, he's got swag!"" Meanwhile, the Obama campaign is upbeat, quietly marshaling hundreds of volunteers from Dubuque to Cedar Rapids, Davenport to Waterloo, to stoke the fires for the incumbent president at a time when all the attention is on the Republican contest. According to two senior Obama campaign aides, the president's 2012 re-election efforts began in Iowa as early as April. Since then, they say they've: • Hired 20 paid staffers.• Opened eight field offices. • Held more than 1,280 training and planning sessions, house parties and phone banks. • Made more than 350,000 calls to supporters. • Held more than 4,400 one-on-one meetings. Covering all 99 counties of Iowa . They are tasking volunteers to avoid relying solely on blanket phone calls right now, and instead create sit-down face-to-face meetings with people to build relationships and gather information: what is happening in their community, what people are hearing, who they are, what they care about, how they can be leaders for the campaign in their community.  They argue that no presidential field campaign has ever done this on a big scale. ""We're in 1,774 precincts, in all 99 Iowa counties,"" said Sue Dvorsky, chairwoman of the Iowa Democratic Party. She added that even though Obama will be unopposed this year, her party still plans on caucusing Tuesday night. And the president, she said, will even make an appearance, ""by the magic of the Interwebs."" When they're not beating up on each other, Republican presidential candidates have spent much of the past few months beating up on Obama. ""We've seen the median income for Americans drop by 10%,"" said presumed Republican front-runner and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, blaming the economy's woes on Obama. ""By the end of his first term -- his only term -- he's on track to amass almost as much public debt as all the prior presidents combined. This has been a failed presidency."" They have hit him on the economy, they've hit him on foreign policy, health care and the size of government. Some even continue to suggest, albeit jokingly, that he is not a legitimate American citizen, as hinted in an offhand comment by Romney's son Matt last week. The younger Romney quickly walked back his comments in a tweet after being confronted by the media. ""I remember, after he got inaugurated ... and he said, 'Look, if I can't get this economy turned around in three years, I'll be looking at a one-term proposition,' "" reminded Mitt Romney during a stump speech Monday in Marion, Iowa. ""Well, I'm here to collect."" But through the attacks, the president has largely remained quiet. Only occasionally has he wandered into the fray, suggesting that he may engage the other side when the dust settles. ""I'm going to wait until everybody is voted off the island,"" he told Jay Leno on ""The Tonight Show."" Iowa has historically been the proving grounds for underdog candidates. In 2008 it was Obama. This year, it could be former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum, who has been surging since the recent CNN/Time/ORC International poll put him in a strong third place behind Romney and U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, but moving up. For Obama, his Iowa test comes in November . Nevertheless, Obama's task in Iowa, considered a pivotal swing state when the general election comes in November, is still grand. He must retain the Democratic support he had in 2008 -- when he camped out in the state for months before the caucuses and visited Iowa more than three dozen times -- while convincing the third of the voters who call themselves independent not to drift back over to the Republican side, and the other third who are Democrats not to stay home. And all this goes on while Republicans continue to grab the spotlight and hammer him throughout 2012. Meanwhile, the base is restless. ""It seems very hopeless ... hope, change ... but nothing changes,"" said Bradshaw, the young barber who is fed up with Obama and the process. When asked what she'd say to Bradshaw, the Iowa Democratic chair's words got pointed. ""Yes, there is frustration, there is angst. But I would say to that person -- and I'd say it directly to his face -- that there has been a remarkable record of achievement in the past four years,"" Dvorsky said, her passion growing. ""I'd point to the record of achievement, in the face of two things happening simultaneously: The near-collapse of the entire economy, an economy that was bleeding 750,000 jobs. And now he has presided over 23 consecutive months of private sector job growth. I'd point to everything he did to pass the Affordable Health Care Act. I'd point to what he did to partner with the Big Three automakers to save the American automotive industry, or bringing combat troops from Iraq home with their families at Christmas, instead of on their fifth or sixth deployment."" ""And he did this in the face of massive opposition from a party who saw as its role to take down a sitting president, not to compromise, not to work with him, but to take him down,"" Dvorsky said. ""This is a group of people, not all of them, who say 'No, heck no, never!' "" ""The real story for the Republicans is going to be not on the night of January 3, but on the morning of January 4,"" she said confidently. ""He'll be on the way back to The White House, and they'll be left sweeping up the floor of the empty rooms, and not much else.""","Obama won Iowa's caucuses in 2008; now he's seeing some frustration from his base .

"It's not some miserable dystopic movie scene about class polarization. The vertical passenger seat -- or ""standing cabin"" -- may be the next big cost-cutting move in aviation, according to a new report whose author says the concept could be here within five years. ""I stumbled across the idea when I was looking (into) ways to reduce the flight ticket price,"" Fairuz Romli, who authored the report published in the IACSIT International Journal of Engineering and Technology, tells CNN by email. Romli, an aerospace engineering professor at the Universiti Putra Malaysia, says his motivation is to lower the cost of air travel to a level competitive with buses and trains. Using the popular Boeing 737-300 as an example, his study calculates that a standing cabin would lead to a 21% increase in passenger capacity while dropping ticket prices by as much as 44%. ""I'm a frequent flier and most of the times during domestic flights, it feels like the flying time is very short that the aircraft is already descending for landing before you can unfasten your seatbelt after takeoff,"" he says. ""Hence the big question came to my mind: in such a short duration of flight time, do we really need to sit down?"" Romli quickly discovered that the idea had already been researched -- most notably by Airbus, China's Spring Airlines and Ireland's Ryanair. The SkyRider (pictured top), developed by Aviointeriors S.p.A. and unveiled at an expo in 2010, is a perching saddle, while Ryanair once flirted with the idea of a ""flat-padded backboard"" with a seatbelt over the shoulders. Cost or comfort? In 2012, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary floated the idea with his characteristic bluntness: ""The problem with aviation is that for 50 years it's been populated by people who think it's a wondrous sexual experience when it's really just a bus with wings."" However, a spokesperson for Ryanair tells CNN that the airline has since abandoned its vertical-passenger plans. ""We have no plans to trial or introduce standing flights,"" says the spokesperson. Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department voiced caution. ""There are very stringent requirements for the aircraft and the passenger seat to meet before the aircraft or the configuration is certified to carry passengers,"" a spokesperson tells CNN. ""This novel standing-room design and the mentioned restraint system are early concepts. It may take much time for them to materialize."" Manufacturers have also expressed doubt about the concept's feasibility. ""We don't believe there are good market opportunities for this idea,"" says Mark Hiller, CEO of Recaro Aircraft Seating, one of the world's major suppliers of commercial airplane passenger seats. ""From our point of view, passengers will not accept to travel that way. Even if such a seat would pass certification tests, we would see it as a great sacrifice for passengers in terms of comfort and living space, even for very short flights."" Fly, don't ride . Romli, whose report contains some intriguing designs for vertical seats, thinks the concept still has legs. ""The idea seemed to be nixed before it was properly analyzed because I couldn't find any published study about it,"" he says. ""After some initial study, it appears that this is not a bad idea after all and has some potentials to be highlighted."" His study concludes that while savings increase as distances get longer, the concept is best optimized on short-haul flights, with tolerance for standing depending on the age and health of individual passengers. ""I've seen people stand on buses and trains before throughout a journey of maybe close to an hour,"" says Romli. ""So if that's possible, then standing on an aircraft (shouldn't) be a far-fetched idea. ""If the option available to reach my destination is either sitting on a bus or train for six to seven hours or standing for an hour and half on an aircraft, I believe there are many people who would opt for the latter if the flight ticket price is reasonably low."" Romli admits his concept is likely to be greeted with skepticism, not least from aviation safety authorities who would have to sign off on the concept. Nevertheless, he believes that his vertical seating concept could win approval in five or six years. ""Airlines like to reduce operational costs and given this option, I believe they have a big interest for it as well. ""The only major challenge is to obtain the approval from the aviation authorities and if the concept has proven to satisfy all necessary requirements in terms of passenger safety, there shouldn't be much problem for it to become reality.""","New university study calculates value of standing-room-only cabins on planes .

"Yemen's army has retaken most of Jaar, the final al Qaeda stronghold in the country's southern Abyan province, forcing hundreds of militants to flee the town, two local security officials told CNN. Hundreds of militants were still skirmishing with military forces Tuesday. The state-run Saba news agency also reported that government forces were retaking Jaar on Tuesday morning after fierce battles against al Qaeda with the support of the Yemeni air force. The agency confirmed that Batis district is now under government control. The officials estimated that more than 80 militants were killed over the last three days in the province, inlcuding 29 on Tuesday, mainly in areas surrounding Jaar and Zinjibar. They also confirmed that seven troops were also killed Tuesday. The officials said that thousands of landmines were planted in the roads and mountains leading to Jaar and were the reason for the government's slow progress over the last two weeks. In a statement, the Yemeni Embassy in Washington said Tuesday that Yemen's military retook areas previously controlled by the militants, including the governor's mansion in Zinjibar. ""Demining engineers have been dispatched to sweep and clear previously held areas in Abyan,"" the statement said. Military forces also aim to recapture the coastal town of Shaqra in Abyan province. And troops are making gains in the city of Azzan, an al-Qaeda stronghold in Shabwa province, it said. Hundreds of pro-government resistance fighters joined government lines last week. Eyewitnesses in Jaar told CNN that most civilians fled the town last week after the government warned they would attack if militants did not put down their arms. A senior Defense Ministry official told CNN that hundreds of militants are still fighting government troops in Jaar and the takeover will be complete by nightfall. ""Our troops entered Jaar but are not in total control of the town yet. We expect the town to be cleansed from al Qaeda by late Tuesday evening,"" the official said on condition of anonymity, as he is not authorized to talk to media. He said that al Qaeda militants fled Jaar to the coastal city of Shuqra, where the army has already targeted the fighters with shelling and airstrikes. ""The militants are surrounded now, and it is a matter of time before they surrender,"" he added. The government intensified its offensive against al Qaeda two months ago after newly elected President Abdurabu Hadi vowed to fight the militant group until its members are killed or surrender to the government. Ansar al-Sharia, an offshoot of al Qaeda, took over mass areas of Abyan province last May, benefiting from the political turmoil in the country. The Sanaa-based Abaad Strategic Center told CNN that the current government success in the war against al Qaeda came after the military was united and now serves a nation rather than factions. ""With a divided military last year, terror networks gained power and ground. The power transfer last February played a major role in weakening al Qaeda,"" said Abdul Salam Mohammed, president of the center.","Security officials and news agency: Troops forced al Qaeda militants from the town of Jaar .

"A U.S. drone mistakenly targeted a wedding convoy in Yemen's al-Baitha province after intelligence reports identified the vehicles as carrying al Qaeda militants, two Yemeni national security officials told CNN on Thursday. The officials said that 14 people were killed and 22 others injured, nine in critical condition. The vehicles were traveling near the town of Radda when they were attacked. ""This was a tragic mistake and comes at a very critical time. None of the killed was a wanted suspect by the Yemeni government,"" said a top Yemeni national security official who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to talk to media. U.S. officials declined to comment on the report. The convoy consisted of 11 vehicles, and the officials said that four of the vehicles were targeted in the strikes. Two of the vehicles were completely damaged. Among the killed were two prominent tribal leaders within the province. Residents in Radda were outraged about the attack and called on the Yemeni government to put an end of drone strikes in their region. ""More than 50 innocent civilians in our town have been killed by drones,"" said Abdullah al-Kabra, an eyewitness to the drone strike. ""All those who were killed were supportive of the governments anti-terror campaign. That will surely not be the case of their tribes and families if the government does not strongly intervene,"" he added. Yemeni security experts have argued that drones have on numerous occasions have directly played into al Qaeda's favor, turning peaceful tribal communities into vengeful killers. ""The attack proved the need for tighter control and regulations as far as drones are concerned. At times, they have proved deadly and destructive to civilians,"" said Abdul Salam Mohammed, the president of the Sanaa-based Abaad Studies & Research Center.

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Rene Lecour's plan started out simple: Take his son on a skateboarding trip to someplace ""epic."" While he and his son, Kaya, were searching the internet, they saw videos of Cuba's skateboarders making do with beaten-up and jerry-rigged boards. Economic shortages and the U.S. embargo make it difficult to get most sporting equipment there. For skateboarders, it was nearly impossible. ""We both said right away, 'We are going there,' "" Lecour recalled. Lecour owns a chain of skateboard shops in South Florida and thought his contacts in the skating community would make it easy for him to bring boards to Cuba. He was wrong. ""I e-mailed every single skateboard company I know,"" Lecour said. ""The only two responses I got were unfortunately one person who said we shouldn't be allowed to go because of the embargo. Another 'genius' said we shouldn't come because all the skaters are all communist."" As a first-generation Cuban-American, Lecour had already been dreaming of visiting the island where his parents where born. The recent relaxing of travel restrictions under the Obama administration makes visiting easier for Cuban-Americans and for people on cultural exchange trips. But he didn't want to go empty-handed. A former DJ whose arms are crisscrossed with tattoos, Lecour put out the word that any board, no matter how worn or weathered, would be welcomed by the Cubans. Slowly, as he and his family got ready for the trip, skateboards began to trickle in. ""The response from the kids has been amazing,"" Lecour said. ""It's easier for a 9-year-old kid who skates to understand the need than for a 30-year-old head of a skateboard company, who just doesn't get it."" A week before the flight to Cuba, he held a skateboard party for people wishing to donate. Heavy metal rock played at a skate park in Miami's Kendall neighborhood in the background as dozens of teenagers practiced their moves. The boards continued to pile up in front of Lecour. ""This is really awesome,"" he said as the reality of the trip sank in. Cuban skaters like Che Alejandro Pando Napoles rely on generous foreigners like Lecour. Pando said there are skate parks around the island but no skate shops. There is nowhere for skaters to buy their first boards or replace ones that break, he said. ""Sometimes, it holds back your progression,"" Pando said. ""You see a set of stairs and you say, 'I am not going to do anything down there because I will break my board. I'd rather keep my board healthy than do that trick I really want do.' "" Pando lives for skating, a point he drives home by showing visitors his wedding video where, after the ceremony, he, his bride and wedding party roar away on skateboards. Before coming to Cuba, Lecour had been trying to get in touch with Pando, the closest thing to a leader in Havana's skate scene. Within an hour after landing, Lecour randomly bumped into Pando on the street in a kind of only-in-Havana coincidence. The two skaters quickly made plans to skate together and distribute the duffel bags full of boards and gear that Lecour brought with him. Walking into the skateboard area at Havana's Parque Metropolitano, Lecour immediately saw several dozen skaters and realized that he hadn't brought enough equipment to go around. Pando told him not to worry and said they would hold a skate competition. As the local skaters flew off ramps and attempted tricks, the Americans' eyes went wide. Lecour; his wife, Yirka; son, Kaya; and family friend Shane were stunned that the Cubans skated the way they did with the sorry gear they had. ""I don't how that guy uses such small wheels on that board,"" Lecour whispered. Soon, the contest was over. While most of the skaters didn't win boards, they seemed happy with the hats, T-shirts or sunglasses they received. The skaters who won boards wore ear-to-ear grins. Lecour says he doesn't want to be portrayed as ""the gringo coming to the rescue."" ""The Cuban skaters have been incredibly generous. They keep inviting us to meals and to get together,"" he said. ""I am already thinking of my next trip and all the gear I am going to bring.""","Rene Lecour is a first-generation Cuban-American and skateboard shop owner .

"British officials ""are close"" to identifying the ISIS militant who beheaded American journalist James Foley, according to Britain's ambassador to the United States, Peter Westmacott. Westmacott told CNN's Candy Crowley on Sunday he couldn't elaborate on the identity of the killer, who is seen decapitating Foley in a video posted last week on YouTube. ""We're putting a great deal into the search,"" he said, referring to the use of sophisticated technology to analyze the man's voice. In the video, Foley, 40, is seen kneeling next to a man dressed in black, who speaks with what experts say is a distinctly English accent. Linguists said that based on his voice, the man sounds to be younger than 30. He also appears to have been educated in England from a young age and to be from southern England or London. Voice, words may provide clues about Foley's killer . The video shows another U.S. journalist, identified as Steven Sotloff, being held by ISIS. The militant warned that Sotloff's fate depends on what President Barack Obama does next in Iraq. A day after the video was posted, Obama vowed the United States will be ""relentless"" in striking back against ISIS. Airstrikes continued to hit ISIS targets near Irbil and the Mosul Dam on Sunday, U.S. Central Command said in a news release. The majority of the strikes have been in support of Iraqi forces near the dam, which briefly fell under ISIS control. Mourners pack Foley's hometown church . Meanwhile Sunday, hundreds of mourners crammed into Foley's hometown church in New Hampshire to attend his memorial Mass. ""This moment in our lives is international in scope; crossing all boundaries, yet very personal,"" Bishop Peter A. Libasci said. ""[We are] bound together by a deep sense of human compassion and heartfelt remorse."" Foley's parents, who received a standing ovation, asked for privacy and thanked mourners for their support. Foley disappeared on November 22, 2012, in northwest Syria, near the border with Turkey. He was reportedly forced into a vehicle by gunmen; he was not heard from again. At the time of his disappearance, he was working as a freelancer for the U.S.-based online news outlet GlobalPost. His family released a letter Sunday said to be written in June by Foley. Because his letters were confiscated in captivity, Foley's family said he asked another hostage set to be released to commit the letter to memory. In the letter, Foley reflects on favorite family memories -- a trip to the mall with his father, a bike ride with his mom -- and gives details of his time in captivity. Comfort from others being held . ""Eighteen of us have been held together in one cell, which has helped me. We have had each other to have endless long conversations about movies, trivia, sports,"" Foley wrote, describing makeshift games of checkers, chess and Risk. ""The games and teaching each other have helped the time pass. They have been a huge help."" He had specific messages of love for his brothers and sister, and to his grandmother he told her, ""please take your medicine, take walks and keep dancing."" By the time he wrote the letter, he had already been held captive for a year and half, and seemed to waver between remaining hopeful for his release, while also resigned to his fate.  While addressing his brothers and sister, he gives specific wishes on who his money should go to and thanks them for ""happy childhood memories."" But he closes the letter by addressing his ""Grammy."" ""Stay strong,"" he told her, ""because I am going to need your help to reclaim my life."" The following month, over the July 4 weekend, U.S. special operations units were sent into Syria to rescue Foley and other hostages held by Islamist militants, a U.S. official told CNN. Several dozen of the most elite U.S. commandos from Delta Force and Navy SEAL Team 6 flew in on helicopters but couldn't find the hostages, including Foley. His captors recently sent an e-mail to his family threatening his death -- a message Philip Balboni, the CEO of GlobalPost, described as ""vitriolic and filled with rage against the United States."" Foley's captors demanded 100 million euros ($132.5 million) in exchange for his release, Balboni told CNN last week.","Foley family releases letter written by the journalist while in captivity in June .

"Newt Gingrich insisted Sunday that some illegal immigrants who have become full community members should be able to stay in the country, but he added that his policy would require 7 million or more to go back to their home nations before having a chance to return. Appearing on the CBS program ""Face the Nation,"" the front-running Republican presidential hopeful repeated his call for some kind of citizen review board to assess whether illegal immigrants would be eligible to get a residency permit and stay in America. Gingrich, a former House Speaker, said the American people would not tolerate the forced removal of someone who has lived in their community for 25 years, has children and grandchildren, and belongs to a local church. However, Gingrich said he expected about 1 million of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants to qualify under the review board process to remain in the country, adding that they would have to be sponsored by an American family. The rest would have to leave, Gingrich said. ""My guess is that 7 or 8 or 9 million would ultimately go home to get a guest or worker permit and return under the law,"" Gingrich said. His immigration policy has come under attack from some rival candidates who call it a form of amnesty -- a virtual dirty word for the conservative tea party movement.","Newt Gingrich says more than 7 million illegal immigrants would leave under his policy .

"Paris, France (CNN) -- A tape of a man claiming to be Osama Bin Laden threatening France appears to be authentic, the French Foreign Ministry said Thursday. Bin Laden warned France to get its troops out of Afghanistan and not to oppress Muslims at home in a tape broadcast by the Al-Jazeera network Wednesday. ""If you want to tyrannize and think that it is your right to ban the free women from wearing the burqa, isn't it our right to expel your occupying forces, your men from our lands by striking them by the neck?"" the speaker demands, in reference to recently passed French legislation barring women from covering their faces in public. ""This message only confirms the reality of the terrorist threat against which the French authorities have taken and continue to take appropriate measures,"" the ministry said in a statement Thursday. ""French authorities are fully mobilized to secure the release of seven hostages kidnapped in Niger on September 16. These statements by Bin Laden will not affect our assessment of the situation of our hostages and obviously will, therefore, not erode our efforts to secure their release. France will continue to fight against terrorism alongside its partners,"" the ministry said. Five French nationals were kidnapped last month along with a person from Togo and one from Madagascar. A photograph of them was posted September 30 on a website linked to al Qaeda. French authorities are treating the Bin Laden message ""very, very seriously,"" CNN counterterror analyst Paul Cruickshank said. An opposition lawmaker Wednesday urged ""contempt towards these terrorists. ""All of this is derisory, contemptible. We must take this message for what it is but we must stand together in France, all French, whatever the circumstances and whatever our differences,"" said Francois Loncle, a Socialist Party member of the foreign relations committee of the National Assembly said on RTL radio. The demands of the speaker on the tape are clear. ""The only way to safeguard your nation and maintain your security is to lift all your injustice and its extensions off our people and most importantly to withdraw your forces from Bush's despicable war in Afghanistan,"" the speaker says. The tape is audio only. The speaker does not appear. CNN was not able to confirm that it is really Osama Bin Laden, the head of al Qaeda. But fake Bin Laden tapes have never been broadcast, U.S. intelligence experts say. ""As you kill us, you will be killed. As you imprison us, you will be imprisoned, and as you threaten our security, we will threaten your security and the initiator of the injustice is the true aggressor,"" the speaker says. The France's terror alert level is red, the second highest, authorities say. It did not change immediately in response to the new tape. Paris has been on edge lately, with the Eiffel Tower having been evacuated twice. Al Qaeda has issued a series of threats against France in the past, and French citizens have been killed by groups in Africa claiming affiliation with Bin Laden's group. Bin Laden is still providing strategic direction to al Qaeda from a base somewhere in Pakistan, Cruickshank said. ""He is still involved in actual plotting... signing off on (an) operation, Western intelligence authorities believe,"" he said. But there have been only two successful attacks on the West since September 11, 2001, he pointed out. Commuter trains in Madrid, Spain, were bombed in March, 2004, killing 191 people. Public transport in London, England, was bombed in July, 2005, killing 52, plus four suicide bombers. France has 3,750 troops in Afghanistan, according to NATO's International Security Assistance Force. French lawmakers approved a ban on full-face veils in September, citing security concerns and saying they violated women's human rights. The ban is scheduled to come into effect in the spring.","NEW: The message only ""confirms the terrorist threat,"" the Foreign Ministry says .

"Iraq's largest Christian town has been overrun by the same militant Islamists who have gained a foothold in parts of eastern Syria and western and northern Iraq. The latest advance by ISIS (or the Islamic State, formerly known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria) has caused thousands of Christians in the city to flee, just as other minority groups targeted by ISIS have done, as well as Shiite Muslims. The French government confirmed that the Iraqi city of Qaraqosh has fallen into the hands of the militant al Qaeda offshoot. ""France is highly concerned about the latest progress of ISIS in the North of Iraq and by the taking of Qaraqosh, the largest Christian city of Iraq, and the horrible acts of violence that are committed,"" French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said in a statement. France called for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council to discuss the threat in Iraq. The exodus from Qaraqosh was already under way, as the city and its surroundings have been the target of ISIS attacks for weeks. Qaraqosh is a historic Assyrian town of 50,000 people, approximately 20 miles southeast of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, where ISIS also has control. Map: Where is ISIS? When ISIS took over Mosul, many residents from there had fled to Qaraqosh. In Mosul, ISIS issued an ultimatum to Christians living there: Convert to Islam, pay a fine or face ""death by the sword."" Three other nearby villages were also attacked overnight and Thursday, local police officials told CNN. Two of the villages -- Bartella and Tall Kayf -- are predominately Christian. Hundreds of Christian families fled to the north, police said. The third village is Hamadaniya. Kurdish forces were involved in heavy clashes protecting the area from ISIS. ISIS seeks to create an Islamic caliphate that stretches from Syria to Iraq. The group has aggressively targeted Iraqi minority religious groups. Nickolay Mladenov, the special representative of the U.N. secretary-general for Iraq, last month condemned the persecution of Christians, Shia Muslims and Yazidis, as well as the Shabak and Turkmen ethnic minorities. The Pentagon is considering conducting emergency air drops to the thousands of stranded Yazidis in northern Iraq, a U.S. Defense official told CNN Thursday. A spokesman for Pope Francis, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said on Thursday that the pontiff is deeply concerned about the reports coming from northern Iraq. ""Christian communities are particularly affected: a people fleeing from their villages because of the violence that rages in these days, wreaking havoc on the entire region,"" Lombardi said in a statement. Lombardi quoted a prayer the Pope offered last month, expressing to the persecuted that ""I know how much you suffer, I know that you are deprived of everything."" Most Iraqi Christians are Chaldeans, who are Roman Catholic communicants.","French government confirms that ISIS has taken over Qaraqosh .

"Valdosta, Georgia (CNN)Relatives and former schoolmates of a south Georgia teenager who was found dead inside a rolled-up gym mat at his school in 2013 appeared under subpoena Wednesday before a federal grand jury looking into the case. The parents of Kendrick Johnson have been unwavering in their belief that their son was murdered, even after the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office ruled the death accidental and closed the case in May 2013. In October 2013, the Department of Justice launched a federal investigation into Johnson's death. Several members of Johnson's extended family and current Lowndes High School students were seen walking into the federal courthouse in Macon Wednesday. This was at least the third convening of the grand jury. Witnesses were subpoenaed to testify in the case on at least two dates in 2014, according to documents reviewed by CNN. ""While our investigation has proven to be more complicated and taken longer than I had originally anticipated, we remain committed to following the facts where they may lead,"" U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, Michael Moore told CNN Friday. The Department of Justice has taken possession of the gym mat where Johnson's body was found and other evidence, according to the records released by the sheriff's office to CNN. Despite concluding there was no foul play in Johnson's death, the local sheriff's office conducted additional interviews on the case as recently as December. The details of the recent interviews, conducted by the sheriff's office between November 24 and December 23, were provided to CNN in response to a public records request. The sheriff's office interviewed about two dozen current and former Lowndes High School students who were on the school's wrestling team on January 10, 2013, the day Johnson disappeared. His body was found the next day. The additional interviews appear to be related to a video released by attorneys for Johnson's family that challenged the whereabouts of one particular former student who was on the wrestling team. Coroner slams handling of Kendrick Johnson case . According attorneys for Johnson's family, the former student confronted Johnson and told him ""it ain't over"" regarding a confrontation Johnson had with the former student's younger brother. CNN is not naming the former student because he has not been called a suspect or been charged with a crime. The former student would have been at a wrestling match in another city at the time Johnson is believed to have died, but lawyers say the bus did not leave Lowndes High School until after Johnson's death. An attorney for the sheriff's office confirmed the recent interviews, but did not respond to a question about whether the case has been reopened. ""The Lowndes County Sheriff's Office initiated the interviews of the Lowndes High School wrestling team coach, the bus driver and wrestling team members in response to claims made known to the sheriff's office that the wrestling team was still on the school's campus when Kendrick Johnson was last known to have been alive,"" according to a statement provided by the department's attorney. ""Investigators have tried unsuccessfully to contact some wrestling team members and will continue to attempt to reach those team members."" The statement added that the interviews so far have not changed the facts believed by the sheriff's office. ""The information gathered thus far indicates that the bus carrying the wrestling team had left the school's campus prior to the time that Kendrick Johnson was last known to have been alive,"" it said. Scene pics point to foul play, expert says . Several of those interviewed said the former student was on a school bus en route to a state tournament in Macon, Georgia, the day Johnson disappeared. Others could not say for sure. However, there are inconsistent accounts about when the bus left the school. Some of the current and former students told investigators the team left campus before 10 a.m. Other students said the team left just before noon. The bus driver told investigators the team left at 12:30 p.m., according to incident reports. According to a school bus schedule provided to CNN by an attorney for the school, the bus left for the tournament at 4 p.m., hours after Johnson was last seen alive around 1:30 p.m. The wrestling coach told investigators the school bus schedule was inaccurate, as it reflected a request made by him at the beginning of the wrestling season, and not the time the bus left on the actual day of the wrestling meet. Analysis of the coach's cell phone bill showed the last call that accessed a tower in the Valdosta area that day occurred at 11:28 a.m. At 1:53 p.m., the phone accessed a tower in Cordele, Georgia, nearly 90 miles outside of Valdosta. An employee at Candlewood Suites in Macon told investigators the coach checked in for the team at 4 p.m., according to incident reports. One student told investigators that the weigh-in for the team began at 4 p.m., according incident reports. According to a document included in the investigative file, the former student participated in the weigh-in on January 10, but when that weigh-in occurred is not indicated. Previously released documents showed that the former student and his brother were advised by their attorney in 2013 not to speak to investigators or provide them any statements. In August, the brothers' parents filed a $5 million libel lawsuit in federal court against the publishers of Ebony magazine and writer Frederic Rosen. The suit claims stories written by Rosen and published in Ebony magazine and on Ebony.com imply that the brothers played a part in Johnson's death and their father was involved in a conspiracy to cover it up. The claim that the brothers played any part in the death ""is completely untrue,"" according to the lawsuit. The interviews come more than 18 months after Lowndes County Sheriff's Office closed its investigation into Johnson's death. Sheriff's office investigators concluded Johnson got stuck while reaching for a shoe at the center of the rolled mat. The state medical examiner determined Johnson died as the result of accidental ""positional asphyxia."" Johnson's parents, Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, believe the story about the shoe is a coverup and that their son was murdered. A forensic pathologist hired by Johnson's family later found evidence of ""unexplained, apparent nonaccidental blunt force trauma"" to the neck. He concluded Johnson's death was the result of a homicide.","Relatives and schoolmates of Kendrick Johnson testified at grand jury Wednesday .

"The rationale behind Confucius Institutes -- an international chain of academic centers run by an arm of the Chinese government -- is understandable. With extraordinary economic growth in the past three decades, China is again center stage in the international community. In the early years of reform, it was imperative to bring the outside world -- particularly its technology and capital -- into China. Today, it's imperative to introduce a born-again China to the outside world, especially in light of the myriad stereotypes, misperceptions, and distortions about China that are still prevalent among many foreigners. While introducing Chinese language and culture to foreigners is a good idea, the aggressive attempt to do so via Confucius Institutes has proved problematic. The Hanban -- the Chinese government body that operates the Confucius Institutes -- often gives one the impression that it is carrying out a worldwide ideological campaign. Several U.S. educational institutions -- most recently the University of Chicago and Penn State University -- reportedly have decided to cut ties with the Confucius Institute program over concerns about academic freedom. In another widely reported incident that adds to suspicions about their ideological agenda, the Hanban ordered pages from a Taiwan scholarly foundation to be removed from a program handed out at the 20th conference of the European Association of Chinese Studies in Portugal in July of this year. Soft power push . By the end of 2013 there were already 440 Confucius Institutes and 646 smaller Confucius Classrooms across 120 countries. Given that the first Confucius Institute was founded in 2004 in South Korea, this is nothing short of a cultural ""Great Leap Forward"" targeted at foreigners. China's leaders appear to have subscribed to the view that though China already possesses formidable hard power -- in economic and military terms -- it won't be viewed as a truly global power like the United States until it also possesses equally formidable soft power. The elements of Chinese soft power frequently cited by foreigners when asked about their views of China include the Great Wall, the Forbidden City, pandas, Kung Fu, and the Peking Opera. With the exception of pandas, however, they are all cultural products of ancient China. What China really lacks is not culture per se, but modern culture that can easily resonate with people around the world . Instead of promoting the controversial Confucius Institutes that are interpreted by some as a sign of cultural colonialism by a rising China, the Chinese government would be better off attracting foreigners to China through scholarships, research grants, and cultural products. What would Confucius say? Confucianism was the ruling ideology of China for the better part of Chinese history until 1911. It comprises a set of values, norms, and practices that derive primarily from the teachings of Confucius, a philosopher-teacher who lived from 551 to 470 BC. While Confucianism has much to say about nearly every aspect of Chinese society, it does not advocate aggressively spreading Chinese culture outside the Middle Kingdom. Instead, at least from my perspective, it exhorts Chinese emperors to make China a ""city on the hill"" -- a shining example of advanced culture for other people to admire and emulate. Besides, there is hardly anything in Confucianism that is both uniquely Chinese and universally appealing. In fact, some of the core elements of Confucianism -- such as the priority of the state over the individual, hierarchical society, and deference to authority -- are obviously at odds with the dominant trends of the contemporary world. Those who are familiar with China's post-1949 history also won't miss the irony that the Communist government is marketing Confucius as the icon of Chinese culture. Confucius and his thoughts were attacked as backward and as an obstacle to China's modernization during the Cultural Revolution (1966-76). As a result, Confucianism was marginalized in Chinese discourse, only to be revived and promoted by Chinese leaders in the past decade. In the end, the key to China's soft power hinges on modernizing Chinese culture instead of marketing its ancient heritage. Such cultural modernization includes not only more appealing cultural products and business innovations, but also fundamental reforms in the Chinese body politic. To paraphrase the wise words of Confucius, perhaps Chinese leaders should worry less about having little soft power abroad and more about building up a prosperous, free, and just society at home.","China is keen to project its culture as well as its economic and military power .

"As the situation in Iraq escalates, the U.S. finds itself awkwardly aligned with a country once vilified as part of the ""Axis of Evil.""  While Iraq loses control of its western border to ISIS rebels, the U.S. decides to pragmatically turn to its geopolitical interests to calm this disaster. The unlikely result is Iran sending military weaponry and planes -- including Russian combat jets -- across the Iranian border to aid the Iraqi national army. This shift in alliance seemed implausible a few years ago, but since President Hassan Rouhani took office last year tensions between the U.S. and Iran have slowly and cautiously thawed. While Iraq plummets into further chaos and fragmentation -- the Kurds are expected to vote for full autonomy in an impending referendum -- improvement in U.S-Iran relations may be the only silver-lining in this otherwise catastrophic affair. Yet supporters of U.S.-Iran relations should not forget the importance of promoting relations through long-term economic ties, rather than one based on purely geopolitical military needs. In the past decade, war has raged on two of Iran's borders, and seemingly both Iran and the U.S. shared common enemies in the Taliban and Saddam Hussein. However, foreign policy alignments in the region did not result in sustained diplomatic ties.  By easing sanctions and fostering economic growth in Iran, the U.S. can ultimately promote a sustainable relationship based on mutual needs and benefits. Now more than ever, the opportunity for just such a partnership exists in Iran's budding technology market. Currently, Iran has the highest total number of Internet users in the Middle East; almost half of Iranian households have some access to the internet. There are more Internet users in Iran than in Saudi Arabia, UAE, Jordan, Israel, Kuwait, Lebanon and Qatar, combined. Interest among young Iranians in technology and entrepreneurship is rapidly increasing.  Iran's Center for E-commerce Development recently announced that nearly 70% of applicants for electronic retail licenses are younger than 30. Rather than focusing on industries such as oil and gas, which ultimately trickles down profits to a few large companies closely aligned with the regime, promoting commercial development in the arena of tech entrepreneurship creates a high-skilled middle class. A thriving Iranian middle class will have an invested interest in maintaining close relations with the U.S. The long-term benefits of commercial development in Iran's tech sector are endless. Transparency and increased openness in civil society through advances in social media, internet infrastructure and access to information are just some of the added benefits of a robust tech industry. Promoting tech over other industries in Iran also allows the U.S. to play an active role in a market that empowers women in business. Unlike many Western countries where women only account for 10% of the tech industry, women in the Middle East account for 35% of tech entrepreneurs. This number is astonishing considering Western notions of the marginalization of women in the region. Women in the Middle East are increasingly finding it both convenient and conducive to start small businesses from the comfort of their homes, and, thanks to increased internet access, they are now able to tap into global markets. The benefits of promoting the burgeoning tech industry in Iran have not gone unnoticed. Silicon Valley entrepreneurs plan to gather this September to discuss entrepreneurship in Iran, and, in the event that sanctions are lifted, the possibility of building bridges between entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley and their Iranian counterparts. Iran's very own TedX Tehran, scheduled to take place in Tehran later this year, is a result of enthusiasm surrounding technology and entrepreneurship. Much of the eagerness surrounding Iran's tech scene is based on the possibility of the U.S. changing its sanctions policy regarding Iran. Unlike his predecessor, Rouhani made headway on nuclear program negotiations with world powers earlier this year. Even making use of social media, Rouhani tweets a softer image of the Iranian presidency by posting pictures of himself in sweatpants watching World Cup games. Most importantly, Rouhani debuted his presidency with a message of economic openness and a desire to reintegrate Iran back into the international community. Iran's dismal human rights record still remains on the table, but the country's open approach on economic issues may be human rights activists' best chance to address political freedoms down the road. Iran's support of Prime Minister Nuri al Maliki's government and majority-ruling Shiites in Iraq puts Iran in a position that is aligned with U.S.'s geopolitical interests. What remains unclear is whether the current situation will give way to a stable partnership if the Iraq crisis is contained. The Iran-Contra affair in 1986 demonstrated that the U.S. could covertly set aside ideological differences for military advantage. However, as history has demonstrated, unlikely wartime bedfellows rarely equate to stable diplomatic policy. Indeed, if history has taught the U.S. anything, it's that Iran is a resilient country with vast potential -- potential that expands far beyond merely oil, gas and guns.

"For a while, Iraq faded from the collective consciousness. But what's happening there should make people sit up and take notice. Extremist militants have overrun Mosul, the country's second-largest city. As many as half a million civilians have fled their homes to escape the violence, and the brazen incursion has highlighted all the weaknesses of the government's ability to maintain security. Here's how things got to this point. So, what happened? Monday night into Tuesday, militants seized Mosul's airport, its TV stations and the governor's office. They freed up to 1,000 prisoners. Police and soldiers ran from their posts rather than put up a fight, abandoning their weapons as they went. The militants took their place in the city's boulevards and buildings. ""There was no presence of any government forces on the streets, the majority of their posts destroyed and manned by (Islamist militants),"" resident Firas al-Maslawi said. An audio recording purportedly from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria promises more fighting in more Iraqi cities, including Baghdad. ""Continue your march as the battle is not yet raging,"" a voice said to be that of ISIS spokesman Abu Mohammed al-Adnani says. Why is this significant? Mosul is the nation's second-largest city. What's happening here doesn't bode well for Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's administration. It calls into question whether he has a handle on the country. The devastating militant advance, which had been building for some time, is proving an object lesson of much that is wrong in Iraq and the region -- growing sectarian tensions at home and a festering civil war over the border in Syria. It also shows that the extremists are seeking to extend their influence and can strike swiftly and effectively against Iraq's American-trained security forces. Who are the militants? They're part of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, an al Qaeda splinter group. Here's how extreme the militant group is: Even al Qaeda has disowned it. The Mosul siege has made ISIS the single most dangerous, destabilizing radical group in the region. The group is also known by some as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant. Its members include Europeans as well as Chechens, Turks and many fighters from other Arab countries, some attracted by the conflict in Syria. How to respond to the ISIS threat . What do they want? They want to establish an Islamic caliphate, or state, stretching across the region. ISIS has begun imposing Sharia law in Syrian towns it controls, like Raqqa, forcing women to wear the full veil, or niqab, in public and banning music. Have they made such incursions before? Yes. In past months, they've wrested control of Iraqi cities like Falluja and parts of Ramadi from authorities, just as they've done with Syrian towns over the border. Militants believed to be from ISIS have also taken control of two villages in Iraq's Kirkuk province and seized parts of the oil town of Baiji in Salaheddin province, authorities said. Have they been able to keep their control? Not really. Despite the territorial advances it has made in Sunni-dominated Anbar and Nineveh provinces, ISIS still has ""significant weaknesses,"" a U.S. counterterrorism official says. ""It has shown little ability to govern effectively, is generally unpopular, and has no sway outside the Sunni community in either Iraq or Syria."" How is all this tied to Syria? ISIS grew out of al Qaeda in Iraq. In the west of Iraq, its militants were responsible for killing and maiming many U.S. troops. In 2006, their commander -- the bloodthirsty Abu Musab al-Zarqawi -- was killed in a U.S. strike. In the years afterward, with American help, Iraqi tribal militias put the al Qaeda upstart on the defensive. But when U.S. troops left, the extremist militants found new leadership, went to Syria, grew stronger and returned to Iraq, making military gains often off the backs of the foreign fighters drawn to Syria's conflict. Now the group has footholds in both countries and is blamed for destabilizing both. In Syria, where its forces have clashed with other Islamist groups, observers say the internecine fighting has played into the hands of Bashar al-Assad's regime by distracting rival factions from their campaign against the Syrian military. What's the situation in Mosul right now? More than 500,000 civilians have fled since the fighting started over the weekend, according to the International Organization for Migration. The northern city's four main hospitals are inaccessible because of fighting, and some mosques have been converted to clinics, the IOM said. There's a lack of drinking water in the western part of the city since the main water station for the area has been destroyed by bombing. Food is running low and few areas are receiving electricity, while fuel for generators is also running out. What does this mean for Iraq? While Iraq is plagued by multiple daily car bombings and suicide attacks, the sheer scale of the attack on Mosul -- and the brewing humanitarian crisis tied to it -- bodes ill for the country's stability. According to the United Nations, last year was Iraq's most violent in five years, with more than 8,800 people killed, most of them civilians. Already this year, almost half a million people have been displaced from their homes in central Anbar province by fighting between the same extremist group and government forces. One major reason Mosul made headlines is how swiftly the city, to all intents and purposes, fell. What does this mean for the United States and the West? The last U.S. military forces left Iraq at the end of 2011, after nearly nine years of deadly and divisive war in the country. Talks that might have allowed a continued major military presence broke down amid disputes about whether U.S. troops would be immune to prosecution by Iraqi authorities. Iraq's security forces, trained by the United States at a cost of billions of dollars, have proved unable to dislodge the militants from strongholds in Anbar province and have now been routed in Mosul. The result seems likely to be continued or growing instability in Iraq and the wider region. This, at a time when the global economy is recovering, could have an unwelcome impact on oil markets. There's also concern that foreign fighters with ISIS may go back to their native countries, in Europe and elsewhere, and carry out terror attacks there. That worry was heightened last month by the shooting deaths of four people at a Jewish Museum in Belgium; the suspect, according to French officials, recently spent a year in Syria and is a radicalized Islamist.","As many as half a million civilians have been forced from their homes .

"Jamal Abu Rubieh, owner of the Brookline Lunch cafe, knew something wasn't right when Brendan Mess and Erik Weissman sat quietly in a back corner booth that August night in 2011. Gone was the usual boisterous banter typical of their regular visits. Abu Rubieh says things became even more tense when a bald, blue-eyed man twice their age arrived.  The three talked for about an hour. ""He sounded different and he acted different, the guy with them, and they all were, like, nervous,"" Abu Rubieh said. ""And that time, (Mess) was really serious and he wasn't himself."" The man, who Abu Rubieh had never seen before and hasn't seen since, had a thick Boston accent. Three weeks later, on September 11, Mess, 25; Weissman, 31, and another friend, Raphael Teken, 37, were found dead in their second-floor Waltham apartment. Their throats had been slashed ear-to-ear, marijuana was sprinkled across the corpses, and several thousand dollars in cash was found at the scene. A neighbor says Mess' girlfriend discovered the bodies and came to his house. Her feet were bloody, and she was crying. She  calmly asked for a cigarette and called police. Then-District Attorney Gerry Leone said days after the crime that the victims and two unknown perpetrators appeared to have known  each other and that it was not a random crime. No suspects were named, no arrests were made. The case got no attention in the national media at the time.  But nearly two years later, when Mess' friend Tamerlan Tsarnaev was named as a suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings, authorities began to take a closer look at the unsolved murders. Rolling Stone cover of bombing suspect called 'slap' to Boston . Murders assumed to be drug crimes . The victims were fun-loving guys, by their friends' accounts. Weissman had a business making high-end glass bongs and was planning to move to California once his drug charges in Massachusetts were resolved. His lawyer, Norman Zalkind, says his client was close to a plea deal when he was killed, but declined to say more, citing attorney-client privilege. Weissman, Teken and Mess were ""always together,"" said Abu Rubieh, but he didn't know how the three came to know each other. Mess' picture still hangs on the restaurant wall. A dish called the Brendan Benedict was named in his honor. Nearly two years later, many who knew the victims are puzzled by the fact that they weren't questioned by detectives investigating the killings. They're also wondering why police didn't question Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Mess and Tsarnaev were high school friends and sparring partners at John Allan's Wai Kru gym in the Boston neighborhood of Allston. But Allan said when he talked to Tsarnaev several days after Mess' killing, his friend showed no signs of grief. ""He kind of laughed it off, saying, you know, that Brendan probably got what he deserved ... making bad choices, that those were the repercussions he had to face,"" Allan said. Video shows Boston bombing suspects at gym days before attack . Though only Weissman had faced a drug charge, Allan said the assumption was that the murders were connected to drugs. ""Around here, we call it 'NHI' -- no humans involved,"" Allan said. Meaning,he explained, that ""there were three drug dealers murdered over drugs and money, which seems apparent because that was what was left over the bodies."" But Bobby Black, a friend of Weissman and a writer for the pro-marijuana magazine High Times, said the theory of a drug  robbery makes little sense when no drugs or money appear to have been taken from the apartment where the men were killed. ""Anyone who knew Erik would know that he was in no way some kind of dangerous drug dealer,"" Black said. ""He was a college-age kid who loved weed. I think that the police writing it off early on possibly may be the reason they didn't investigate further, which could have prevented the Boston bombings."" Deadly connection? The killings -- on the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks -- occurred as Tsarnaev, who came from a family of Chechen refugees, was becoming an increasingly devout Muslim. Allan said Tsarnaev and another gym member, Ibragim Todashev, used to pray together in the gym. Allan said he was never questioned by police after the gruesome murders of the three friends. Neither was Abu Rubieh, who says he had a father/son relationship with Mess and who knew Tsarnaev as well. Four months after the murders, Tsarnaev left Boston and traveled to the Russian republic of Dagestan, where his parents lived. Sources have told CNN they believe Tsarnaev became radicalized on that trip, and some law enforcement sources have questioned whether the marathon bombings would have happened had Tsarnaev been questioned in the Waltham killings. Authorities accuse Tsarnaev, 26, and his younger brother, Dzhokhar, 19, of planting the bombs that exploded April 15 at the finish line of the Boston Marathon.  Three people were killed there and more than 260 wounded.  While Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed a few days later as he and his brother engaged in a firefight with police, Dzhokhar was captured. He was arraigned last week on charges of killing four people -- including an MIT police officer who was shot as the brothers fled -- and wounding hundreds more in the bombings and the pursuit. He pleaded not guilty. Boston Marathon Terror Attack: Fast Facts . In the ensuing investigation of the marathon bombings, authorities also questioned Todashev, who had moved to Florida. While being questioned in his home May 22 by an FBI agent and Massachusetts state police officers, Todashev admitted he played a direct role in the Waltham killings and implicated Tamerlan Tsarnaev as well, a federal law enforcement source told CNN at the time. Todashev told investigators the men were killed during a drug ripoff because he and Tsarnaev were afraid they would be able to identify them and tell police what happened, according to a law enforcement source. A U.S. government official briefed on the investigation said that while being questioned, Todashev suddenly knocked over a table, brandished ""a long-handled object"" and lunged at the FBI agent, who shot and killed him.  The shooting remains under investigation. Group seeks probe into death of man who knew Boston bombings suspect . Middlesex County District Attorney Marian Ryan said after Todashev's death that the Waltham killings remain an ""open and active"" case, and that police and prosecutors ""have conducted a thorough, far-reaching investigation."" ""This investigation has not concluded and is by no means closed,"" Ryan said. Now some of those who knew Weissman, Teken and Mess are questioning whether Tsarnaev should have been under scrutiny long before the marathon attack. Looking back at the young man's attitude following the Waltham murders, Allan wonders whether a big clue was missed. ""Retrospectively, maybe there was something behind that,"" he said.","Three friends were found dead in a Waltham apartment in September, 2011 .
Tamerlan Tsarnaev knew one of the men well, friends say .
A friend of Tsarnaev's, Ibragim Todashev, was killed during questioning by the FBI .

"The latest ""Worldwide Caution"" issued by the U.S. State Department last week made for grim reading, telling of ""an increased likelihood of reprisal attacks against U.S., Western and coalition partner interests throughout the world, especially in the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, and Asia."" Much of the bulletin dwelled on the threat from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. But among a laundry list of dangerous places was this sentence: ""Terrorist organizations continue to be active in Yemen, including al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP)."" It was a brief, generic commentary on the group still regarded by many analysts as al Qaeda's most effective affiliate, and which is now exploiting a surge in political turmoil in Yemen. As a reminder of how dangerous AQAP is, the State Department on Tuesday published an unusual ""wanted"" list ""offering rewards totaling up to $45 million for information leading to the locations of eight key leaders"" of the group. The U.S. has invested heavily in Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi, who was elected in 2012 and pledged to reverse gains that AQAP had made in the south and east of the country. Hadi reorganized Yemen's military, and for a while -- with considerable US assistance -- it put AQAP on the defensive. But on September 21, the country's always combustible political landscape exploded when Houthi rebels seized government buildings in the capital, Sanaa, and its airport. The Houthi are Shia Muslims who make up an estimated 30% of the population but have long felt marginalized by the Sunni majority in Yemen. They are now demanding greater political influence. Blast kills 47 at Houthi protest in Yemen . Sunni-Shiite divide . That is a red rag to radical Sunnis, including supporters or members of AQAP, who regard the Houthi as apostates to be driven from Muslim lands or killed. They claim Iran is bankrolling the Houthi rebellion in an effort to control Yemen's Red Sea coast, on one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. Monday's capture by Houthi militia of much of the coastal city of Hodeida -- Yemen's second-largest port -- will only heighten that fear. Even Hadi has alleged that the Houthis are being trained and advised by Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militia. Saudi Arabia, which provides energy and financial support to Yemen and shares a long border with it, is looking on with growing apprehension. On Monday, Hadi appointed a new Prime Minister, Khaled Bahah, who is currently Yemen's envoy at the United Nations. Some Houthi leaders spoke positively of Bahah's appointment, but unless Houthi militia are reined in, Yemen could quickly become another theater in the Sunni/Shia confrontation gripping much of the Middle East. Exploiting the conflict . AQAP is doing as much as it can to stoke a sectarian war. Last week, it launched a devastating suicide bombing against a Houthi rally in Sanaa, which killed nearly 50 people. It also released a video showing its fighters purportedly removing 14 Houthi men from a bus and executing them. At the same time, AQAP has stepped up attacks against the army and police; a suicide bombing at a military checkpoint in remote Hadramaut province last week killed 20 soldiers. In recent weeks, the group has released a series of appeals to Sunnis in Yemen to support its campaign against the Houthis, casting itself as the only group capable of preventing what it claims is a plot by Iran to take over the country. Its videos and statements refer to the ""Yemeni turned Houthi army."" ""Do not leave a checkpoint for (the Houthis) that you do not strike, nor a headquarters that you do not bomb, nor a troop carrier that you do not explode,"" said one of AQAP's leaders, Nasser bin Ali al-Ansi, in a video released on September 30, according to a translation by the SITE Intelligence Group. Hardline Sunnis in Yemen have staged anti-Houthi demonstrations in recent weeks. And even some in government may now see AQAP as a useful counterweight to the Houthis. The worst-case scenario: a repeat of 2011, when roiling protests in the capital and infighting between different army units allowed AQAP to seize control of several towns in southern Yemen -- towns they held for months. Now, there is the additional destabilizing factor of a growing secessionist movement in the south. Once again, Yemen seems close to becoming a failing state; the sort of place where al Qaeda incubates quickly. AQAP defections . The main threat to AQAP may be from within, as some jihadists opt for the even more radical option of ISIS. There is now a group called The Islamic State Supporters in the Arabian Peninsula, which has promised attacks against Houthis. According to Flashpoint Partners Intelligence, which monitors jihadist communications, one former AQAP commander, Ma'moun Hatem, has already pledged allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Assuming AQAP can avoid defections, its ability to plan terror attacks beyond the Middle East remains far greater than that of ISIS. U.S. officials say AQAP still poses the most active threat to the homeland and fear it is starting to share its bomb-making know-how with jihadists in Syria, specifically within an al Qaeda affiliate, Jabhat al-Nusra. AQAP chief bomb-maker Ibrahim al-Asiri has three times plotted to bring down U.S.-bound aircraft, coming closest to success on Christmas Day in 2009 when a Nigerian recruit attempted to blow up a bomb in his underwear in the skies above Detroit. Earlier this year, AQAP leader Nasir al Wuhayshi, who is also al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri's deputy, told a large gathering of fighters that attacking the United States was a central priority, a message repeated by al-Ansi last month. ""Each front must strike America and its interests everywhere. We have recognized the main enemy, America, for decades,"" al-Ansi said. While debate rages in Washington and Europe about the intentions of ISIS and al-Nusra in exporting terror to the West, the most lethal of al Qaeda's affiliates is exploiting and stoking Yemen's latest crisis.","Many analysts say al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is al Qaeda's most effective affiliate .
The group is exploiting political turmoil in Yemen, where Houthi rebels are fighting government .
Radical Sunnis say Houthis are apostates and should be driven from Muslim lands or killed .
Yemen could become a theater in the Sunni/Shia confrontation gripping much of the Middle East ."
"He saw it first-hand on a reporting trip in Guizhou province -- scores of village children going to school hungry. But Deng Fei refused to stand by and watch. So in 2011, he left journalism and started his own private charity to provide free meals for China's village children. And in three years, his ""Free Lunch for Children"" campaign has fed a total of 92,000 kids across 23 Chinese provinces. ""The government won't be able to solve all our problems,"" Deng tells CNN. ""We must give up this unrealistic idea and take the initiative ourselves."" China may be a single-party state run from the very top. But grassroots activism has been bubbling up from beneath, bringing about much needed social support and change. Officially, China has around half a million registered NGOs, most with government connections. As for the number of unregistered independent NGOs? According to James Miles, The Economist's Beijing Bureau Chief, it's a figure close to some two million. ""These are tiny little groups of people all over the country working on trying to improve the lives of people living in those areas -- whether it's on labor issues, women's rights or the environment."" Force for change . For more than two decades, Han Dongfang has been an advocate for workers' rights in China. He first gained international attention during 1989 Tiananmen Square protests when, as a railway worker, he helped set up China's first independent trade union. After the crackdown, he continued his advocacy work in Hong Kong as the founder and director of the China Labor Bulletin. Han says China's national trade union has failed to represent the needs of the nation's workers: ""The official union always sees itself as, unfortunately, government officials. They don't see themselves as workers' representatives."" So the workers of China have no choice but be their own force for change in the country, striking for better wages and launching civil action for just compensation. And with the rise of social media in China, the country's civil society is more connected and better resourced than ever before -- bringing people in need together, including China's once isolated coal miners suffering from deadly lung diseases. ""There are a hundred thousand silicosis victims who are supposed to die in the cold and be silent, but now they're making their voices heard,"" Han tells me. ""They're going to die soon, yes. But their voices are brought together on a platform through social media. That has changed everything. It brings people out from isolation."" Social power . The power and reach of social media has played a major role in developing a civil society in China. It has also unsettled the Chinese Communist Party, which operates an Internet censorship regime that filters content and frequently takes down posts critical of Party rule. But it's also forced Beijing to take part in the online exchange. ""Social media is definitely a game changer to China,"" says Isaac Mao, a Chinese social media researcher and Internet freedom activist. ""The government and the civil society, they all participate in these platforms as their voice channels. And the government has to follow the game rules of social media, not their traditional rules."" With state-run media channels like the People's Daily or CCTV actively managing social media accounts, an online civil society has forced the Party to embrace a more interactive platform. But can it lead to real world political change? Political tension . James Miles, who has had more than 20 years of experience covering China, believes civil society may very well play a critical role in changing China's political landscape. ""What we might see now compared with 25 years ago during Tiananmen, is that the cells of organizations are much more quickly formed together,"" says Miles, who was in Beijing to cover the protests in 1989. ""It would be much more difficult for the government to control information, to stop people organizing, and to stop the flow of information in these kind of critical events."" Beijing is aware of the growing strength of the country's civil society, and is taking action to rein them in and take control. ""The government itself is beginning to try and bring more of these small hitherto unregistered groups into the official fold -- registering them, getting to know them,"" says Miles. ""It hopes, presumably, to get to control them better."" And yet the blessing of the government has proved essential for many non-governmental organizations in China. ""Government support is also very important to us,"" says ""Free Lunch"" campaigner Deng Fei. ""They have the control over a lot of resources, and they decide whether or not we can access the schools."" That's people power in the People's Republic of China.","A civil society is forming under single-party rule in China .
Widespread use of social media means China's civil society is more connected and better resourced than before .
Beijing is aware of growing strength of the country's civil society and is taking action to rein it in ."
"(CNN) -- Family members of passengers aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 faced an agonizing wait for answers, as the aircraft remained unaccounted for more than a day after it was scheduled to land. In China, home of most of the 239 people on board, relatives of the passengers gathered in a conference room at a hotel complex in the Lido district of Beijing. They grew increasingly frustrated Sunday as the wait continued. More than 100 people signed a hand-written petition that demanded ""truth"" from the airline by Sunday evening. They also urged the Chinese government to help them deal with Malaysian authorities. More family members arrived Sunday. Video from Reuters showed Malaysia Airlines personnel in Beijing, where Flight 370 was headed, helping family members apply for expedited passports so they could fly to Kuala Lumpur early this week. Zhang Guizhi, aunt of passenger Li Yan, told CNN that she had arrived from her native Henan province in central China and remained uncertain about how the airline would help her obtain a passport to travel to wherever the plane is found. She started crying when she mentioned that her 31-year-old niece had traveled to Malaysia with her husband and four friends for vacation. A man who identified himself as the brother-in-law of passenger Ding Lijun said he had just arrived from Tianjin. He teared up when he said Ding had been working in Malaysia as a construction worker for a year and was taking his first trip home. What happened to Flight 370? On Saturday, a young woman from the nearby port city of Tianjin broke down in tears as she told CNN that her boyfriend was on board the flight. They had plans to marry, she said. Another woman wailed for her missing son as she was led inside. ""My son was only 40 years old,"" she cried. ""My son, my son. What am I going to do?"" A man who identified himself as a friend of passenger Yang Jiabao showed reporters the missing man's driver's license in the hope it might help authorities find the man. Acting Malaysian Transportation Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said he met with families in Malaysia on Sunday. ""It has been another long day. Thank you all for your thoughtful prayers. Hope will get us through the days ahead,"" he tweeted. Plane bore painters, pilgrims, others from around the world . Families reeling . Late Saturday evening, family members met with a Malaysia Airlines delegation that had been dispatched to the Chinese capital to provide support and information. At a news conference in the early hours of Sunday, Ignatius Ong, CEO of Malaysia Airlines subsidiary Firefly and spokesman for the airline's management group, announced that immediate families should head to Kuala Lumpur. The airline would cover their travel expenses and would fly the relatives to the plane's location ""once the whereabouts of the aircraft is determined,"" he said. Chinese media reported Sunday that the airline announced it would help next of kin get passports if needed and was planning to fly the first group to Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday. With at least 12 nationalities on board, Flight 370's disappearance left families around the world reeling. Besides the Chinese passengers -- who, according to Chinese state media, included a delegation of painters and calligraphers returning from an exhibition and a group of Buddhists returning from a religious gathering -- the flight carried passengers from Malaysia, India, Indonesia, Australia, the United States, France, New Zealand, Ukraine, Canada, Russia and the Netherlands. The Canadians have been identified as Muktesh Mukherjee, 42, vice president of China operations for Xcoal Energy & Resources, and his wife Bai Xiaomo, 37. The couple, who once lived in Montreal, lived in Beijing with their two young boys, the Canadian broadcaster CTV reported Sunday. Stolen passports . The airline's manifest showed the passengers hailed from 14 countries, but later it was learned that two people named on the manifest -- an Austrian and an Italian whose passports had been stolen -- were not aboard the plane. The plane was carrying five children younger than 5 years old, the airline said. Stolen passports raise questions . Mei Ling Chng is believed to have been one of the people onboard. A Malaysian national who has been living in Pennsylvania since 2010, she worked as a process engineer, according to Tracy Kilgore, spokeswoman at Eastman Chemical Company, where Chng works. ""As you can imagine this has been a very shocking and sad situation, and our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of all aboard the missing flight and in particular to those of our co-worker,"" the spokeswoman said. The family of Philip Wood, one of three Americans identified as among the missing, issued a statement describing him as ""a man of God, a man of honor and integrity. His word was gold."" ""Incredibly generous, creative and intelligent, Phil cared about people, his family, and above all, Christ,"" the family said. ""Though our hearts are hurting, we know so many families around the world are affected just as much as us by this terrible tragedy."" Texas-based firm Freescale Semiconductor confirmed that 20 employees were passengers on Flight 370. Twelve are from Malaysia and eight from China, the company said Saturday. ""At present, we are solely focused on our employees and their families,"" Freescale's president and CEO Gregg Lowe said in the statement. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with those affected by this tragic event."" Later, the company tweeted: ""Your thoughtful words and prayers for Freescale families and friends affected by MH370 give comfort."" The company was making counselors available with around-the-clock support for employees affected by the tragedy, the statement said. First officer was transitioning to 777-200s . CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton, Serena Dong, Yuli Yang and Dayu Zhang in Beijing contributed to this report.","The family of Philip Wood describes him as a man of God, honor and integrity .

"Anthrax. Smallpox. A potentially deadly strain of the flu virus. The American public trusts the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to handle dangerous biological materials, but recent incidents have put a damper on the agency's reputation, members of Congress said Wednesday. ""What happened was completely unacceptable,"" CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said in his testimony before the Energy and Commerce Committee's subcommittee for Oversight and Investigations. ""It never should have happened."" Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pennsylvania, the subcommittee chairman, opened the hearing by summarizing the troubling incidents that have come to light over the past month. In early June, dozens of CDC workers were potentially exposed to anthrax after a lab failed to inactivate the dangerous bacteria before transferring it to a lower lab. A subsequent investigation revealed ""an alarming series of failures,"" according to one of the subcommittee members, including an incident of cross contamination between a relatively safe and a potentially deadly strain of the flu virus. An outside investigation by the U.S. Department of Agriculture found dangerous biological materials stored in unlocked refrigerators and a general lack of lab workers following safety protocols. Investigators say the anthrax that was believed to be deactivated was transferred in Ziploc bags, which are obviously not approved to carry such materials. ""This is troubling, and it is completely unacceptable,"" Murphy said. ""The CDC is supposed to be the gold standard (for lab safety). ...This is not sound science, and this will not be tolerated. These practices put the health of the American public at risk."" Murphy said the CDC was lucky that no one appears to have been infected during the anthrax incident, but ""sooner or later that luck will run out."" This is not the first time the subcommittee has heard of safety issues at CDC labs, said Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colorado. Multiple hearings over the past decade have shown lapses that together reveal a problem with safety reporting at the agency, she said. ""What we all need to know is the plan to change the culture at the CDC,"" DeGette said. ""We can do a lot but we can't legislate a culture change."" Frieden, who took the CDC director job in 2009, acknowledged that he and other CDC managers failed to recognize a ""critical pattern."" The CDC has closed the labs that were involved in the incidents. They won't reopen until better safety procedures are in place, Frieden said. Scientists have also stopped moving any biological material out of its two highest-level labs while their procedures are being re-evaluated.

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- In his traditional Christmas message delivered Saturday to crowds braving winter's chill, Pope Benedict XVI urged peace in the Middle East and asked for God's comfort upon beleaguered Christian communities in Iraq and elsewhere in the region. The annual ""To the City and the World address, known in Latin as ""Urbi et Orbi,"" mentioned other global hot spots. The pope wished for security in places overcome by conflict like Somalia, Sudan's Darfur region, Ivory Coast, Afghanistan and the Korean peninsula and those nations like Haiti that are grappling with the consequences of disease and natural disaster. ""May the light of Christmas shine forth anew in the Land where Jesus was born, and inspire Israelis and Palestinians to strive for a just and peaceful coexistence,"" Benedict said in the speech delivered in 64 languages, from English and Latin to Maori and Maltese. ""May the comforting message of the coming of Emmanuel ease the pain and bring consolation amid their trials to the beloved Christian communities in Iraq and throughout the Middle East,"" he said. Violence targeting Christians in Iraq in recent months forced some Iraqi churches to tone down Christmas observances, even canceling Christmas Mass. Many fear an exodus of Christians from that part of the world. In his message of hope, Benedict also prayed for the perseverance of Christians in communist China. ""May the birth of the Saviour strengthen the spirit of faith, patience and courage of the faithful of the Church in mainland China, that they may not lose heart through the limitations imposed on their freedom of religion and conscience but, persevering in fidelity to Christ and his Church, may keep alive the flame of hope,"" he said. Tens of thousands of people clutched umbrellas under drizzle and rain to hear the 83-year-old pontiff at St. Peter's Square in Vatican City. ""May the birth of the Saviour open horizons of lasting peace and authentic progress for the peoples of Somalia, Darfur and Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast); may it promote political and social stability in Madagascar; may it bring security and respect for human rights in Afghanistan and in Pakistan; may it encourage dialogue between Nicaragua and Costa Rica; and may it advance reconciliation on the Korean peninsula,"" he said. This year's Christmas festivities appeared uneventful compared to last year when a woman jumped a barrier and lunged at the pope during Christmas Eve Mass. Benedict was quickly helped to his feet by his aides and not injured in the incident. The service resumed as the woman was detained by Vatican police and taken to a mental institution.","Benedict prays for peace in the Middle East and in beleaguered Christian communities .

"Creteil, France (CNN) -- At Sunday mass in the suburbs outside Paris, a score of Iraqi Catholics are praying for themselves and their families. They are part of a group of nearly 60 brought here in early November after a bloody massacre at their church in Baghdad. In that attack, believed to have been carried out by al Quaeda, 56 people died, including two auxiliary priests, and more than 70 were injured -- among them the parish priest of Our Lady of Salvation, Father Raphael Kuteimi. Kuteimi was struck by grenade fragments during the attack, which went on for four hours. He was brought to France for medical treatment. The church did have some police protection, he says, but there are just too many threats against the Christian community. Pierre Whalon, an Anglican bishop who helps bring the religiously persecuted to France, points out that no one takes note of threats to the Christian community until there is a major attack. ""There has been a Christian assassinated every single day since 2003. At least one,"" Whalon says. ""You know, the news reports just get tired of it, because what's new? Another Christian or two or 10 murdered today in Mosul or Baghdad or elsewhere."" Whalon says the Christian community of Iraq, which numbered about 1.2 million before the war began, now is down to about 400,000, with many moving out under the threat of death. After the attack in October, the number of people on waiting lists seeking refuge in France swelled to more than 4,000. No one wants to see such an ancient community disappear, says the bishop, least of all the refugees themselves -- but they have little choice. That's certainly the feeling of ""Elias,"" who wants to keep his real name secret because he still has family he is trying to bring out of Iraq. The former government bureaucrat was wounded in the church attack and says he heard the gunmen say they want to drive Christian infidels out of the country. The last thing he wanted to do, he says, is to leave his homeland. ""I am now in France, not my country,"" says Elias. ""I have no job here. I had a very good job in Baghdad, a very good salary, my wife too, assistant professor. And now we will come here -- for what? But if we have no protection to keep ourselves away from them, we must leave, and that's why you see us here."" ""I have memories. I have lots of feelings about Iraq, especially Baghdad,"" he continues, choking back tears. ""So when I remember some of them I start to cry sometimes. I cry -- but what can we do? It's our destiny."" It's a destiny now being played out thousands of miles from his home, .","Many Iraqi Christians have fled to France, reporting threats and persecution .

"She may be 65 years old, but outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is not retiring. Instead, she's considering helping the foundation led by her husband and leaving the door open to a possible presidential run in 2016. ""I have absolutely no plans to run,"" Clinton told CNN Tuesday -- political speak that does not rule out a change of plans -- as she prepared to hand over her State Department responsibilities to John Kerry. ""I am out of politics right now."" Clinton's 'future adventures' Clinton said she planned to refocus her efforts after stepping down on speaking and writing and working on behalf of women and girls. She suggested she may also add her muscle to the work carried out by the Clinton Global Initiative, which is led by former President Bill Clinton. Graham: Clinton 'got away with murder' ""I'm very proud of what my husband has done in the last 10 years,"" Clinton said.  ""We are going to look to see how we can join our efforts together."" She noted that their daughter, Chelsea, has also been involved in philanthropic work after Tropical Storm Sandy. ""We just have public service in our DNA,"" Clinton said. Clinton acknowledged that her legacy includes unsolved problems in some of the world's hot spots, but noted that she assumed the job four years ago at a time of great uncertainty. ""I think we have to go back to my beginning in January '09 to remember how poorly perceived the United States was, how badly damaged our reputation was, how our leadership was in question, how the economic crisis had really shaken people's confidence in our government, our economic system, our country."" Opinion: President Hillary Clinton? If she wants it . Clinton said she had sought initially simply to restore international confidence in American leadership, ""sometimes against pretty tough odds,"" which included a crisis in the world's economy and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The challenges went on to include responding to the Arab Spring, forming international coalitions to inflict sanctions on Iran and North Korea and dealing with changes in Burma, Europe, Latin America and Africa. ""I'm very proud of what we've done,"" she said, adding, ""We began to practice diplomacy in a different way -- not that we jettisoned everything done before, but added new tools to the box."" Granderson: Joe, make way for Hillary . Asked about the Obama administration's failure to appoint a woman to any of the top four Cabinet positions, she said, ""What we have to do is take a look at the broad picture."" Though opportunities exist for young women to get into the pipeline, ""I think there is still a ways to go until we have the kind of critical mass that I want to see."" Clinton, who lives with her husband in the hamlet of Chappaqua in Westchester County, New York, said she was looking forward to waking up Monday without a schedule for the day -- a first. ""I've had a job ever since I was 13 years old,"" she said. ""When I wasn't in school, I was working. I think it's going to take some adjustment."" Clinton, who was hospitalized recently for a blood clot, said she was feeling great. ""I've got enormous amounts of energy that have to be harnessed and focused,"" she said.

"The shooting death of Ibragim Todashev, an associate of the alleged mastermind of the Boston Marathon bombing who was killed in a scuffle with FBI agents, was justified, Florida's Ninth Circuit State Attorney Jeffrey L. Ashton said in an investigative report Tuesday. As expected, the report concluded that there was no wrongdoing in the shooting of Todashev and that ""the actions of the Special Agent of the FBI were justified in self-defense and in defense of another."" The finding, reported by CNN last week, concurs with an FBI internal review of the shooting, which supported the agent's account. It also matches what the Florida state attorney for Orange and Osceola counties found in his investigation. ""Based on the physical evidence -- primarily the various findings of the autopsy, coupled with the reports that we received and the lack of inconsistency -- the events seemed to have occurred the way the agents said that they occurred and that there was no basis to bring criminal charges, that it was a lawful use of deadly force,"" Richard I. Wallsh, executive director of the state attorney's office, told CNN. Evidence reviewed includes photos of the agent showing his injuries, officials said. The shooting occurred on May 22, 2013, as Massachusetts state troopers, accompanied by FBI agents, questioned Todashev, 27, in his apartment in an Orlando suburb, officials said. The report cites FBI documents that said Todaschev was writing a confession to a triple murder when when he attacked, flipping the table he was writing on and striking an FBI agent in the head. Todaschev ran to the kitchen and was heard frantically grabbing items before reappearing in the doorway wielding a long metal handle of a mop or broom. ""There's a belief that maybe he was looking for a knife or another weapon,"" Wallsh said. The report said Todashev took an attack stance with the pole and lunged violently at the agent, who fired three to four rounds. Todaschev went down on his knees momentarily before he ""sprang"" to his feet again. The agent fired another three to four rounds. Todaschev was hit seven times, with fatal shots to his head and his heart, according to the documents. Father: 'Unarmed' son 'not crazy' enough to attack FBI agent who killed him . Massachusetts investigators were pursuing information about a grisly 2011 triple murder that they thought could have been tied to Todashev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who allegedly carried out the deadly bombing in April 2013 with his younger brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed as he and his brother confronted police in the days after the bombing. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was later arrested and jailed. He's awaiting trial. Last week, the Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which called for an investigation into Todashev's shooting, said it was conducting its own investigation of his death. ""Certainly, the FBI's failure to prosecute a single agent in its history for shooting a suspect does not help its credibility,"" the council said in a statement. ""Our concern however is not only regarding whether the agent was justified at the time he pulled the trigger, which was the focus of the state and federal investigation, but about the pattern of civil rights abuse that occurred before, during, and after the killing of Ibragim Todashev."" Todashev's family has disputed that he posed any threat to the law enforcement officers and agents in his apartment. ""My son was definitely unarmed, because he never had a gun,"" his father, Abdulbaki Todashev, told CNN in Moscow in a June 2013 interview. ""He couldn't attack them or fight them; he couldn't do anything because even two men could easily handle him."" U.S. law enforcement officials said Todashev made statements implicating himself and Tamerlan Tsarnaev in the 2011 killings. The FBI had interviewed Todashev before about the marathon bombing because he was a friend who, like Tamerlan Tsarnaev, trained in martial arts. He was cooperative, and the FBI didn't consider him to be involved. Still, Todashev's shooting has raised questions about the FBI's handling of the matter, because any evidence he could have provided is now lost. ""We, in particular, were only looking in fairness to Mr. Todashev and his family, and in fairness to the officers involved, to try to determine whether this particular incident was justified or not,"" Wallsh said. No wrongdoing found in FBI shooting . According to the investigative report, the agents knew of Todashev's skills in mixed martial arts and his criminal history, which  included acts of violence. The suspect refused to meet agents and state troopers at a police station, insisting instead that they come to his Florida apartment. During the nearly five-hour meeting, the suspect's demeanor changed while discussing and eventually confessing to his involvement in the triple slaying in Waltham, Massachusetts, the report said. After Todashev asked to use the bathroom, one of the law enforcement officers removed a large, Samurai-type sword mounted on the wall near the kitchen, the report said. Concerned about his changing demeanor, one trooper texted another trooper and FBI agent: ""Be on guard, He (Todashev) is in a vulnerable position to do something bad. Be on guard now. I see him looking around at times."" Moments later, Todashev attacked. The report said Todashev ""struck the FBI Agent in the head with a coffee table and then armed himself near the front door of the address. As he then re-engaged the FBI Agent and Trooper One, they both perceived Mr. Todashev's movements towards them as being potentially life threatening."" Todashev ""armed himself with a red broom handle"" and charged at the officers, the report said. ""The FBI Agent engaged the impending threat twice, by discharging his issued handgun a total of seven (7) times during two volleys of gunfire."" The use of deadly force by the agent was ""reasonable and justified, and therefore, lawful,"" the report concluded.","Ibragim Todashev knew the alleged Boston Marathon bombings mastermind .

"In the big scheme of consumer electronics, smartwatches can't match smartphones, tablets, or even ultrabooks in piquing public curiosity. And glancing at a photo of the Pebble smartwatch, you wouldn't notice anything too different or special about it -- it looks like an understated digital watch. But this particular smartwatch has captured the public's attention to the tune of $10 million in Kickstarter funding, making it the most-financed project in Kickstarter history. Pebble, a smartwatch that wirelessly connects with your smartphone to alert you of incoming calls and messages, blew past the previous Kickstarter record of $3.3 million only five days after launching its crowdsourced funding effort. It's an amazing feat when you consider just how many big-name smartphone and tablet brands are fighting for the same attention. Time: Pebble Smartwatch pre-orders are sold out, $10 million pledged . What is it about the Pebble that made it such a breakout success? How is the small Pebble team going to put more than $10 million to use? And what, exactly, hides inside this insanely popular piece of hardware? We took a trip to Pebble's Palo Alto office to find out. Inside Pebble R&D . Pebble's headquarters follows the grand tradition of small, Silicon Valley startups. Whereas Apple started its business in Steve Jobs' garage, Pebble is located on the ground floor of Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky's apartment. Granted, it's a nice amount of space. There's plenty of room for several desks, computers, a soldering station, and even a telepresence robot and remote-controlled helicopters. But for a $10 million operation, it's still humble. Of course, the Pebble team hasn't gotten its hands on the money yet. The Kickstarter campaign officially ends on May 18, at which point all backers' credit cards will be charged, and funding will be transferred to Pebble. (Kickstarter takes a 5 percent cut of the total raised money.) But even without cash in hand, Migicovsky and team are moving forward with aggressive product development, a move they can make in confidence now that significant public support is in the bag. They're adding new features — water resistance and Bluetooth 4.0 -- and forging new app partnerships to extend the watch's platform. We had an hour of hands-on time with a Pebble prototype, and found that one of the most impressive features is the watch's unique display. It looks brilliant in direct sunlight and reads like an e-paper display, but refreshes much faster. ""I love it so much. The display is so cool, it's just this pure black display,"" Migicovsky said. ""As soon as I saw it, I knew we had a product."" The Pebble team calls its watch's display an e-paper display, in order to highlight its readability in direct sunlight. The specific component Pebble uses, however, is Sharp's 1.26-inch Memory LCD. This screen doesn't use the anti-reflective e-ink that's so familiar in Kindle and Nook e-readers. Rather, it's a reflective display that uses a PNLC (Polymer Networked Liquid Crystal) module for improved brightness, and HR-TFT (high-reflective thin film transistor) technology to add contrast. One bit of memory is also embedded into every pixel. This makes it possible for each pixel to hold its state without much battery power. And with 144×168 pixels in such a tiny screen, the result is a sharp, paper-like reading experience with dramatic black levels. Thanks to the screen's lower power consumption, the watch's lithium ion polymer battery can keep going for seven days, Migicovsky says. But it's not only the display that makes the Pebble special. The smart, sophisticated design of the watch itself has also inspired public interest. It's not a large, hulking piece of hardware. The watch looked a little big on my small wrist, but was significantly less bulky than the inPulse, a previous smartwatch effort by Migicovsky's team. Before deciding on the Pebble's final design, the team sketched out a number of other possibilities. ""You do 10 designs or 20 designs, then you choose three, and then you design 10 more designs around each of those three, and then you choose a path. We did that for Pebble,"" Migicovsky said. Now that Pebble has officially sold out on Kickstarter -- for a grand total of 85,000 watch orders -- the team still has a lot of work ahead. In its current state, the Pebble prototype is powered by a circuit board that's much larger than the watch itself. The PCB is attached to the watch with a maze of wires, and allows the team to prototype new software and debug the system before commissioning the final miniature board that will go inside the shipping product. ""It's much easier to make a board like this -- it took only two weeks -- whereas if we want to make a miniature board it would take a lot longer and cost a lot more,"" Migicovsky said. ""If we made a mistake, we'd have to remake all of them again."" The ""Big Board"" as Migicovsky calls it, executes all the features that you'll see in the final Pebble. There are four buttons, a 3-axis accelerometer, a vibrating motor, Bluetooth 2.1+ EDR and 4.0, a microcontroller, and 4MB of memory. Migicovsky says the team will design a final, miniature board within the next couple of weeks. Pebble has already ordered more than $1 million worth of components for the watch and will be taking a trip to China soon to visit manufacturers there. (Yes, your Pebble will be made in China.) This is the part of Pebble production where Migicovsky sees potential problems. ""The hard part will be the manufacturing process. There will be things that will come up, and we'll have to solve them,"" Migicovsky said. ""It could be anything. This is our first large-scale manufacturing. There will be some problems, guaranteed."" While the hardware is impressive, where Pebble truly shines is in its software. Pebble will be the first smartwatch capable of connecting with Apple's iPhone, a feature that's helped it reach a mainstream market. Users will be able to customize their watchfaces to their own personal style, and access a number of built-in notification features for calls, text messages, tweets, e-mails, and weather. What's more, Pebble is partnering with third-party app developers to create compatible apps. The company already announced RunKeeper, the popular running and fitness app, as its first official partner. You'll be able to use Pebble to control the RunKeeper app on your iPhone or Android smartphone. Quick Alert for bumps in the night . Pebble has also built a partnership with another Kickstarter success, Twine. Twine, made by Supermechanical, is a small box-like device that has built-in Wi-Fi connectivity, an accelerometer, temperature sensors, and an optional moisture sensor and magnetic switch. Through a simple web interface, you can configure Twine alerts for real-world events. And soon Twine will connect with Pebble too. For example, you could put Twine in your basement during the rainy season and set it to alert your Pebble if the basement starts flooding. The two companies also released a video showing another use case: Attach Twine to a door, and when someone knocks — tripping Twine's accelerometer — you receive an alert on your Pebble that someone's at the door. ""We believe in connecting many simple objects to do powerful things, and when a common backer of Eric's and ours suggested that Twine and Pebble together would be like peanut butter and chocolate, we loved the idea."" John Kestner, Supermechanical co-founder, told Wired in an e-mail. ""[Pebble] is tinkerer-friendly and a kindred post-PC spirit (it even uses the same low-power ARM processor [as Twine]) and by giving users the ability to incorporate Pebble into Twine rules, the possible applications grow exponentially."" The Twine partnership only hints at the many ways a Pebble smartwatch might be useful in people's day-to-day lives. The Pebble team will make an open software development kit available in August, allowing developers to create more applications for the Pebble platform. Pebble has already made Kickstarter history, but it will be even more exciting to see what becomes of the watch once it begins shipping this September. Will it be everything that the 67,000-plus Kickstarter backers are expecting? We won't know until we get our hands on one. It's clear, at least, that the Pebble team is already working hard to make the best possible device for its initial supporters. If you slacked off and didn't get around to pre-ordering a Pebble watch on Kickstarter, don't worry — you'll eventually be able to order a Pebble from the company website.","Pebble, a smartwatch, blew past the previous Kickstarter record of $3.3 million .

"Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos was flown off the Galapagos Islands on an Ecuadorian navy helicopter, authorities there said, an evacuation that happened after the entrepreneur was struck by kidney stones. Asked about the ordeal, Bezos -- in a comment relayed via Amazon -- responded: ""Galapagos: five stars. Kidney stones: zero stars."" A Galapagos-based navy unit said in a press release that Bezos developed renal colic while he was on a tourist cruise near Santa Cruz Island. Daniel Ginez Villacis, a regional coast guard official, ordered that a helicopter fly him from there to Baltra Island. Lt. Pablo Abarca, a spokesman with the Ecuadorian navy, told CNN that Bezos was transported on a Bell 430 helicopter on New Year's Day. The force has an operative unit on the Galapagos Islands, according to Abarca. According to the official press release, Bezos, 49, was then to fly to the United States. While the Ecuador navy said the businessman was being flown back home for surgery, that didn't turn out to be the case. Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener said Saturday about Bezos: ""He got a good outcome. No surgery was required, and he's feeling well."" Renal colic is marked by severe pain associated with kidney stones. According to a National Institutes of Health website, kidney stones can pass naturally -- with those suffering with them encouraged to consume lots of fluids and sometimes taking pain medication to help move the obstructions along. In more severe cases (with particularly big stones,) people can be treated with procedures like shock wave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy (a long tubelike instrument that's inserted through a person's urethra to break stones with lasers) and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (a thin instrument is inserted through a person's back directly into the kidney). Bezos is one of the world's most renowned and wealthy businessmen: In 2012, Fortune magazine named the Amazon CEO its Businessperson of the Year, citing its Amazon Web services, Kindle creation in addition to its wildly successfully core business as an online retailer. More recently, he's ventured into other fields -- including buying the Washington Post Co.'s newspaper business last year.","Spokesman: Bezos had a ""good outcome,"" didn't need surgery and is ""feeling well""

"If you're one of the nearly 20% of Americans who have taken a cruise, you probably already know that these giant pleasure boats have Formula One simulators, herb gardens, skating rinks, Coach stores and stages featuring sketch comedy from Chicago-born Second City. Not since the old playground taunt ""my dad's better than your dad"" have we seen such gee-whiz, oh-wow one-upmanship. Which makes it tantalizingly fun for cruise customers. Cruise virgins, on the other hand, will likely be surprised by the following finds: . Indoor skydiving . It's usually pretty tough to surf, climb a mountain and skydive before lunch. But on Quantum of the Seas, the about-to-launch latest in Royal Caribbean's fleet, guests can even squeeze in a post-triathlon massage before refueling at Jamie's Italian (yep, Jamie Oliver) or one of the other 17 restaurants on board. The indoor skydiving takes place in a 23-foot vertical wind tunnel, powered by four giant fans. The mountain climbing (OK, so it's a climbing wall) and the surf simulator are in SeaPlex, which also has a roller rink and a race track where 30 guests can bump the heck out of each other. Oh, and did we mention the three-story ice bar and the trapeze school? An Apple Store . Celebrity Cruises calls it an iLounge, but it has all the latest Apple products, including a MacBook workstation for checking email and printing boarding passes. Evil Apple geniuses can also teach guests how to create websites, write blogs and turn their photos into artistic presentations. Up to 18 custom classes are offered. Top Chefs . Celebrity Cruises is hosting four sailings this year with 13 chef'testants from the popular ""Top Chef"" show. Needless to say, there will be cooking demonstrations, Quickfire challenges and sampling of the creations we've been drooling over for the past 11 seasons. With cruises to Bermuda, Alaska, the Caribbean, France and Iberia, Celebrity is also dishing up some ""Top Chef"" favorites in their restaurants. As mesmerizing as it is to watch Kristen Kish whip up bacon and cinnamon waffles with boysenberry and strawberry jam, imagine playing poker with Hosea Rosenberg. A George Jetson-style observation capsule . A 135-foot crane arm will lift an all-glass capsule off the top deck of Royal Caribbean's new Quantum of the Seas. From sea level, it's 30 stories tall, roughly the height of the Statue of Liberty. Called the NorthStar Observation Tower, this space-age ride gives bird's eye views to up to 14 guests at a time. Quantum of the Seas is set to launch this November from New Jersey's Cape Liberty. Original Picassos . If you look closely at the crayoned signature on the lithograph outside the ladies' room on Deck 5 of the M.S. Riviera, you'll see the famous painter's name just below the naked lady and crying cherub. Oceania Cruises has more than 20 Picassos, spanning 41 years of Pablo Picasso's illustrious career, most of which hang in the Riviera and Marina's Grand Bars. Also in the collection that American Art Collector called ""stupendous"" are works by Joan Miro, celebrated Cuban artists Wifredo Lam and Rene Portocarrero and Damien Hirst, the British phenom who made his name exhibiting a dead 14-foot tiger shark in a tank of formaldehyde. A prankster Neptune . OK, so it's not the real Roman god. But every time a Hurtigruten ship crosses the Arctic Circle, a crew member who does a very good take on King Neptune hosts a circle-crossing ceremony on the top deck. Ultimately, this jokester dumps a ladle of ice water down each passenger's back. Bowling balls and pins . No stale nachos and tacky carpeting at the bowling alleys on Norwegian Cruise Line's Pearl, Gem and Epic. Although the balls don't always roll straight when seas are choppy, these six-lane bowling alleys come with all the bells and whistles. Even the retro shoes. Live TV talk shows . The ""Wake Show"" is a live TV talk show filmed on Deck 7 of the Regal Princess. The first television studio at sea, Princess Live! features live talks shows, demonstrations and a chance for guests to meet the ship's entertainers. Coffee, pastries and the morning newspaper are perks enjoyed daily by the 280-guest studio audience of ""Wake Show."" Programming starts at 8 a.m. and continues until midnight. Real grass and trees . An entire deck on both the world's largest ships, Oasis of the Seas and Allure of the Seas, is an open-air park with grass, trees and some 12,000 plants. Royal Caribbean calls these football field-sized parks Central Park (its one of seven distinct neighborhoods on board) and uses a full-time landscaping team to keep it all pruned and looking spiffy. There's also a sculpture garden, a chess garden and a five-story wall of greens. Elvis Presley impersonators . Themed cruises are huge, offering a kind of summer camp for quilters or zombie fans or poker players. Just know that if a particular theme piques your interest, you better act fast. Carnival's last New Kids on the Block cruise sold out within hours. Elvis Cruises are also perennial favorites on ship lines and even river cruises throughout the world.

"The father of a friend of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev spoke in support of his son Sunday, saying he was simply in the ""wrong place, (at the) wrong time, with (the) wrong people."" Amir Ismagulov is the father of Azamat Tazhayakov, one of three friends charged in connection with the case. Tazhayakov and Dias Kadyrbayev are accused of obstruction of justice. They have already waived their right to bail. Robel Phillipos, charged with lying to investigators, will appear in court Monday and will ask to be released on bond, his lawyers said in a court filing. The FBI says that on April 18 the three friends went to Tsarnaev's college dorm room at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth. Authorities believe two of the men -- Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev -- removed items from the room, including a laptop and a backpack loaded with fireworks. Here are the latest developments in their cases: . Azamat Tazhayakov . Tazhayakov's father, who lives in Kazakhstan, spoke to CNN in New York. He said he met with his son last week for about 40 minutes. Both father and son believe in the U.S. justice system, Ismagulov said. The government will get to the bottom of what happened and let Tazhayakov go, said the father, speaking in Russian. Tazhayakov is due back in court May 14.  He was already in federal custody on immigration charges related to his student visa, having been arrested in the days after the bombings due to his friendship with Tsarnaev. The Kazakhstan native is charged with obstruction of justice. If found guilty, he could face up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines. He is being represented by Arkady Bukh, an attorney based in New York. Ismagulov said his son always admired and wanted to come to the United States. He was here to study engineering and work in the oil business, his father said. Teenagers sometimes do stupid things, said Ismagulov, stressing that his son didn't know he was doing anything wrong. He was in the ""wrong place, (at the) wrong time, with (the) wrong people,"" he said. Ismagulov said that he asked his son whether he had wanted to help Tsarnaev. He apparently told his father no, saying that if they had wanted to help Tsarnaev, he and Kadyrbayev would have thrown out the bombing suspect's laptop and buried his backpack in the ground. Investigators found the backpack, loaded with fireworks, in a landfill after a two-day search. Tsarnaev's laptop was turned over by Kadyrbayev on April 19, the same day the FBI raided the apartment he shared with Tazhayakov, Kadyrbayev's attorney Robert Stahl said. According to the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth, Tazhayakov is enrolled, but was suspended pending the outcome of the case. Robel Phillipos . Lawyers for the Boston native say he was a ""frightened and confused 19-year-old"" when authorities questioned him several times in the days following the April 15 bombing, which killed three people and wounded more than 260.  Police believe Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, set off the two bombs near the race's finish line. Phillipos was under tremendous pressure when he was interrogated and didn't have an attorney at the time to help him, according to his lawyers, Derege Demissie and Susan Church. In a request for bond filed in federal court, the attorneys say their client's future has been ruined by the arrest. ""He will suffer its enduring and devastating effect for the rest of his life. The only way he can salvage his future is by clearing his name,"" the documents say. Phillipos is accused of lying to federal agents and faces up to eight years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted. He attended high school with the younger Tsarnaev at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where they both live. According to the court document, Phillipos hadn't seen or talked to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev for at least two months before the bombing. He was taking a semester off from UMass-Dartmouth and was only on campus the night of April 18 for a seminar. The document says Phillipos' presence on campus that night is a case of ""sheer coincidence and bad luck."" Phillipos was living with his mother, an Ethiopian who immigrated to the United States in the 1980s and is now employed as a social worker. ""Everyone knows Robel as being a compassionate, thoughtful and sociable person,"" his mother, Genet Bekele, said in an affidavit. Previously, a friend described Phillipos as a good kid who took care of his mom. James Turney told CNN affiliate WBZ: ""Phillipos plays basketball and doesn't have 'any anti-American thing about him.'"" Dias Kadyrbayev . Kadyrbayev also remains in jail, awaiting a May 14 court date. According to an FBI affidavit, Kadyrbayev had seen pictures of the suspects released by the FBI on April 18 and texted Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to tell him ""he looked like the suspect on television."" Tsarnaev texted back ""lol"" and added, ""come to my room and take whatever you want.""' Attorney Stahl also said his client ""did not have anything to do"" with the bombings and disputed that he tried to block the investigation. Kadyrbayev, a Kazakh national, was taken into custody along with Tazhayakov on April 20 on suspicion that he had violated the terms of his student visa, Stahl said. According to an interview his father gave in April, Kadyrbayev, 19, ""missed a couple, or maybe several classes."" ""I can say about my son that he finished school with excellent grades; he was good at math. He helped others. When he saw that help was needed, he always accommodated,"" Murat Kadyrbayev told Tengi News and STV channel in Kazakhstan. Kadyrbayev is not currently enrolled at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth. He is charged with obstruction of justice and could face up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines if found guilty. Kazakhstan's foreign ministry said it was offering consular services to both Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov. ""We would like to emphasize that our citizens did not receive charges of involvement in the organization of the Boston Marathon bombings. They were charged with destroying evidence,"" the ministry said in a statement.","Azamat Tazhayakov's father speaks to CNN after meeting with his son .

"Attorney General Eric Holder is endorsing a plan to reduce sentences for certain drug offenses, which he says could reduce the federal prison population by more than 6,500 inmates in five years. Making a rare appearance Thursday before the U.S. Sentencing Commission, Holder plans to endorse the commission's proposed change. According to prepared remarks provided by the Justice Department, the change would ""make the federal criminal justice system both more effective and more efficient when battling crime and the conditions and behaviors that breed it."" Holder says penalties would still be tough for violent criminals while finding ways to reduce the costs of the federal prison system. The move, which the sentencing commission might vote on in April, aligns with Holder's ""Smart on Crime"" initiative. Joining with conservative lawmakers and governors, Holder has pushed for reduced reliance on prison for certain nonviolent drug offenders. The federal prison system holds 216,000 prisoners. With only 5% of the world's population, Holder notes, the Unites States has nearly 25% of the world's prisoners.

"A Chilean court has settled the question of how then-President Salvador Allende died, confirming that the leader took his own life in 1973 amid a coup. Questions over how Allende's life ended culminated in his body being exhumed last year for forensic tests. An appeals court in Santiago on Monday upheld a judge's ruling that the evidence confirmed the accounts in history texts -- that the leftist leader shot himself at the presidential palace as Gen. Augusto Pinochet's troops closed in. The timing of the ruling is symbolic: Allende took his own life 39 years ago, on September 11, 1973. With the ruling, the case of Allende's death is officially closed. Judge Mario Carroza ordered the exhumation of Allende's remains last year as part of a massive investigation into more than 700 alleged human rights violations during Pinochet's rule. Some of Allende's supporters doubted the story of his suicide. There were theories that he was killed by the military, or by members of his own security service. ""With the goal of establishing the facts of the case, and motivated by the various versions about this episode that exist, lines of investigation were set and decreed, and all were carried out and every detail was satisfactory,"" Carroza wrote in his ruling, handed down last December. The appeals court upheld his findings in a unanimous decision.","A court closes the case on the death of former Chilean President Salvador Allende .

"House Republicans are hoping the third time is a charm in their effort to sue President Barack Obama over his signature health care law. After two Washington law firms backed out of earlier commitments to represent House Republicans in their legal challenge, House Speaker John Boehner hired Jonathan Turley on Tuesday.  Turley is a George Washington professor who is an expert on constitutional law and well known to cable TV viewers as a legal analyst. ""Professor Turley is a renowned legal scholar who agrees that President Obama has clearly overstepped his Constitutional authority.  He is a natural choice to handle this lawsuit,"" Boehner's spokesman Michael Steel said in a written statement. Obamacare's next fight for survival . House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the move to continue the legal effort and referred to Turley as ""a TV lawyer"" in a press conference Tuesday. Pelosi has criticized Boehner's office for using taxpayer funds to pay for the litigation. The Democratic Leader told reporters she hoped the latest announcement on the lawsuit was in response to internal Republican politics, and that the legal fight wasn't a sign that GOP leaders aren't interested in working across the aisle. The House voted mostly along party lines in July to approve a lawsuit against the President for unilaterally making changes to Obamacare.  Although many Republicans backed the delays the administration approved last year, they maintained it was Congress' job to change the law.  But House Republicans have had trouble retaining a firm because of the political blowback on the issue. Obama confident as new enrollment opens at HealthCare.gov .

"(CNN)Whether you think spying on your kids is acceptable in today's digital age or a breach of trust seems to really depend on how you define ""spying"" in the first place. In conversations over email with parents across the country, it's clear that people have dramatically different views about the definition and whether it's an appropriate behavior to help keep children safe. ""I don't call it spying. I call it parenting,"" said Amanda Rodriguez, a mom of three boys in Frederick, Maryland, which is pretty much how I feel as well. Rodriguez says her sons know she will have the passwords to all their social media and email accounts until they're 18 and that she regularly reads the texts of her oldest son, who's now 13. ""I'm not sitting around listening on the other handset when he's on the phone or wearing a disguise to the school dance, but ... were I to become suspicious about his actions or fearful of his safety, I would totally get out my fake mustache and crash a dance,"" said Rodriguez, founder of the blog Dude Mom. John Furjanic, who has a 7-year-old daughter, says spying may sound bad, but it can save a child's life. ""When Elsa was an infant, I spied on her all the time. She had no choice in the matter. We even had a baby monitor,"" said Furjanic. ""As children get older, the risks they will run into grow."" On the other side are parents such as Lori Day, an educational psychologist and mom of a daughter in graduate school, who considers spying ""an invasion of privacy and a violation of trust."" ""I think spying on kids is wrong,"" said Day, author of ""Her Next Chapter,"" a book about mother-daughter book clubs. ""It's a good way of sabotaging your relationship with your child if you get caught."" That is along the lines of what happened to another mom, who didn't want to give her name for fear of throwing her own mother under the bus by talking publicly about an incident when she was younger. ""When I was a young teen, I caught my mother reading my diary, and to this day, I haven't forgiven her for it. I don't want my children to feel the same way about me,"" she said, adding that she will try her hardest to respect her children's privacy when they get older. 'Brutally Honest': What if you don't like your kids' friends? Change the word ""spy"" to ""monitor with a child's knowledge"" and you get more agreement on the part of parents that it's an entirely appropriate thing to do when kids are spending much of their free time on social media. Some 43% of parents with children younger than 18 who have smartphones said their kids know they monitor their phone activity, according a poll conducted near the end of 2013. Cherylyn Harley LeBon, a mother of two, said she reads her children's texts and has controls on their computer so she knows what sites they are visiting. ""I would prefer to call it 'oversight,' which is what my parents employed when my siblings and I were growing up in our small town in western New York when there were fewer issues requiring oversight, namely no Internet, no texting, no issues with young girls meeting young boys/men online and then meeting them in person,"" said Harley LeBon, a writer, strategist and former senior counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Janeane Davis also says she checks her children's text messages and Internet history and even reviews criminal records to keep tabs on her daughter who goes to college out of state. ""I have not found problems yet, but I plan to continue to spy on them as long as I am responsible for them,"" said Davis, a mom of four who blogs at Janeane's World. ""Just as it is my duty to feed, clothe and shelter them, it is my duty to monitor their behavior and protect them from potential harm."" The rule in Rhonda Woods' house is that all passwords and login codes for all apps and devices must be known by her and her husband, or the devices are taken away. ""I will periodically ask my kids to unlock their devices and walk me through their apps, etc. I always explain why I want to see their devices and if I'm looking for something in particular,"" said Woods, a real estate agent in New Milford, Connecticut, and mother of three, ages 20, 13 and 13. Amy Tara Koch also believes in monitoring her 12-year-old daughter's social media accounts but decided to let texts remain private. ""I really believe in establishing a high level of trust,"" said Koch, an author, journalist and style expert. ""In order to have access to a phone ... my daughter had to prove that she could follow rules (my husband had her write an essay!) and commit to limits on phone/social media use. She has really followed through, so I do not read her texts."" The key to keeping kids safe and keeping their trust at the same time is making sure your children are aware you are monitoring them, says family therapist and parenting strategist Tricia Ferrara. ""Be clear and candid that you will have access to any and all accounts until the child has been consistent with accountability and judgment offline as well as online,"" said Ferrara, author of ""Parenting 2.0: Think in the Future, Act in the Now."" 'Brutally Honest': Mean girls are getting younger . For parents such as Jennifer Alsip, a mom of two girls, 18 and 22, it was the threat alone of spying that eliminated the need to ever snoop on her children. ""I never spied on my two daughters, but I always threatened them that I would if they ever gave me reason to not trust them,"" said Alsip, of Robinson, Texas.  ""I think the threat and them knowing I would actually do it if I needed to kept them honest."" Terry Greenwald, a father of three grown children, also never spied on his kids when they were growing up. He recalls one incident where spying might have changed the outcome but said it would have altered the trust between him and his kids. ""I believe mistakes are one way children learn to listen to parents and a part of growing up,"" said Greenwald. ""I realize that allowing them the room to make mistakes is becoming more and more dangerous, but this is the world we live in."" But it is precisely the new world we live, where everything you say online could be used against you at some point, that makes parents such as Nancy Friedman, founder of the video sharing site for tweens KidzVuz, believe it is important for parents to spy on their children's online lives. Chances are, your teen has sexted . ""If you want privacy, the Internet is not the place to find it,"" said Friedman, who has twins in middle school. ""Better for kids to find that out from their parents learning something about them the kid didn't want them to know than for it to be a college admission officer, potential employer or some ill-intentioned stranger getting closer than they'd like."" Sharon Kennedy, a mom of two girls near Denver, has mixed feelings about the issue and probably sums up how a lot of parents reading this might feel. Sure, there are probably instances where some form of spying or monitoring is warranted, she says, especially when technology is such a huge part of everyday life, but aren't there other steps parents can put in place, she asks, such as banning computers and phones from the bedroom during evenings and trying to have family dinners together when possible? ""I truly believe that being present has the most positive effect on our kids,"" said Kennedy. ""More presence = the need for less spying (hopefully!)"" Do you think it's OK to spy on your kids?

"Calling it ""the most extreme case"" of harboring a fugitive, prosecutors want the girlfriend of reputed mob boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger to spend the next decade in prison. Catherine Greig is scheduled to be sentenced Tuesday in U.S. District court in Boston. After more than 16 years on the run, she and Bulger were captured in Santa Monica, California, last July.  In a detailed memo prepared for the judge, prosecutors describe Greig as a ""partner"" who helped Bulger avoid capture.  ""She not only hid his identity, but also hid the fact Bulger had filled their apartment with weapons, enabling Bulger to avoid capture by violence if necessary."" The clues that led to Bulger's capture . Bulger, who is being held without bail, was the head of a South Boston Irish gang before he fled an impending racketeering indictment in 1995. He evaded law enforcement for 16 years before he and Greig were arrested in June 2011 in Santa Monica. James 'Whitey' Bulger may have authored memoirs, prosecutors say . The couple had, for several years, hidden in plain sight in the palm-tree-lined, oceanside city near Los Angeles in a three-story building named Princess Eugenia. After discovering the alleged mobster's location, FBI agents lured the couple into the garage from their third-floor apartment on the pretext that someone had broken into their storage locker, and the duo were taken into custody.  Inside the couple's modest two-bedroom, corner apartment, FBI agents discovered assault rifles, a 12-gauge shotgun, many semi-automatic pistols and revolvers,  a silencer, a Derringer pistol, multiple hunting knives and bundles of cash. Prosecutors say Greig could have walked away at any time but protected Bulger instead, and in so doing deprived victims' family members of reasonable justice.  Bulger is accused of 19 murders during his reign of terror in South Boston during the 1970s and '80s. FBI: $2.1 million reward paid in Bulger case . ""The sentence ought to take into account the broader effect of Greig's conduct,"" wrote prosecutors, who are also seeking a $150,000 fine and three years' supervised release. Bulger's trial is scheduled for November, but his lawyers are arguing there's not enough time to go through the volumes of discovery material they need to prepare Bulger's defense.

"The girls sit quietly on the ground, dressed in traditional Islamic garb, barely moving, clearly scared. ""Praise be to Allah, the lord of the world,"" they chant. The video, released by French news agency Agence France-Presse, purports to show about 100 of the 276 girls kidnapped by Boko Haram fighters nearly a month ago. It's the first time they've been seen since their abduction April 14. In separate shots included in the 27-minute video, a man says he will release the girls only after imprisoned members of Boko Haram are freed, according to AFP. The man identifies himself as Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau. Nigerian officials disputed that claim on Monday, arguing that Shekau is dead. Other experts say the notorious terror group leader is still alive. Whoever the man in the video is, Nigeria's interior minister said, the country isn't interested in negotiating a swap anyway, according to AFP. But at a later briefing, the director of the National Orientation Agency, a government information ministry, said negotiations could be an option when it comes to rescuing the kidnapped girls. When asked whether all options were on the table, agency Director Mike Omeri said yes. ""The government of Nigeria will continue to explore all options for the release and safe return of our girls back to their respective homes,"" Omeri told CNN. The road to Boko Haram's heartland . Experts reviewing video . If authentic, the video released Monday is the first glimpse of the girls since Boko Haram fighters snatched them from a boarding school in the northern Nigerian town of Chibok. A senior administration official told CNN that U.S. officials have no reason to question its authenticity. ""Our intelligence experts are combing over every detail of the video for clues that might help in the ongoing efforts (to) secure the release of the girls,"" the official said. The abductions have resulted in worldwide outrage directed at the terror group and an influx of Western counterterrorism and law enforcement experts to help Nigeria fight it. Filmed in a nondescript clearing surrounded by scrub and trees, the girls appear dressed in gray or black veils. Many look nervous or under duress. In one shot, a girl almost whispers a line from the Quran. In separate shots filmed against a green backdrop, the man who claims to be Shekau says the girls -- who come from a Christian stronghold --  have converted to Islam. He appears to open a window to the possibility of negotiating a swap: the girls for Boko Haram prisoners held by Nigeria. ""By Allah, these girls will not leave our hands until you release our brothers in your prison,"" he said. ""You took our brothers four or five years ago, and now they are in your prisons. You do many things, and now you talk of these girls. We will not let them go until you release our brothers."" But he also says he still plans to sell them into slavery. A reason for optimism? Some observers took the video as encouraging. Not only would it prove that at least some girls are alive and unharmed, said retired U.S. Maj. Gen. James ""Spider"" Marks, a CNN military analyst, it also gives intelligence analysts something with which to work. Nigerian government officials also took notice. The governor of the state where Chibok is located, Borno, ordered officials to distribute the video to parents to help identify the girls. Gov. Kashim Shettima ""views the development as encouraging, especially given the fact that some of the girls said they were not harmed,"" his office said in a statement. ""The governor hopes that the girls did not speak under duress."" Despite the optimism, Marks said it will still be painfully difficult to find and rescue the girls after a month in the terror group's custody. ""We have to lower our expectations, sadly, as to what we think this result and outcome is going to look like,"" he told CNN's ""New Day."" A daring escape . A CNN team made the dangerous journey to Chibok to gather firsthand accounts of the abductions. Before the gun-wielding Islamist militants rode into town, residents said they got cell phone calls that the feared extremist group was on the way. Family and friends from surrounding villages told them of a convoy of cargo trucks, pickups and motorcycles. Residents said they passed along warnings to local authorities that night. Police called for reinforcements, but none came. Everyone, including police, fled into the bush. But the girls remained asleep in their dorms. CNN's Nima Elbagir toured the school, gutted by militants as they fled, and spoke with one of the girls who managed to escape Boko Haram fighters that night. The girl told Elbagir how she made a dash for freedom after militants loaded them into trucks and drove them into the nearby Sambisa Forest. ""We ran into the bush,"" she said of her escape with two others. ""We ran and we ran."" Lost and terrified, she said, they later ran toward flames they presumed were rising from a building set ablaze by the militants in their hometown. The escapees were lucky. The missing girls probably have been separated and taken out of the country by now, officials said. ""The search must be in Niger, Cameroon and Chad, to see if we can find information,"" said Gordon Brown, the former UK prime minister and a U.N. special envoy for global education. But Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan said he believes the girls are still in the forest where the militants disappeared shortly after their capture. Who's the man in the video? Government officials disputed Monday that the man in the video with the girls is Shekau. Security forces have confirmed and are sure Shekau is dead, said Marilyn Ogar, deputy director of State Security Services in Nigeria. ""So whoever is speaking as Abubakar Shekau is not Abubakar Shekau."" The same man appears in Boko Haram videos claiming to be Shekau at least as far back as August. And at least one expert doubted Ogar's claim. Jacob Zenn, an expert on Boko Haram at the Jamestown Foundation, a policy center based in Washington, said he is skeptical of the Nigerian claim unless it can be backed up with hard evidence. He said Nigerian authorities have said Shekau was dead several times, only for him to resurface and for the Nigerian military subsequently to acknowledge that he was alive. ""The two recent videos after the abduction of the girls look similar to most of the images, voice and mannerisms of Shekau in almost all Boko Haram videos, including videos when he was a local imam in northeastern Nigeria before 2010,""  Zenn said. If the government's assertion turns out to be untrue, it wouldn't be the first time it has been wrong about the terror group since the girls' abductions. Early in their disappearance, government officials said many of the girls had been recovered -- news that, sadly, turned out to be incorrect. Global search effort . While experts analyze the video, the international effort to find the girls is gaining steam. U.S. and British officials are in the capital of Abuja to help look for the girls, plan rescue missions and advise on ways to quash the terror group. The United States is providing manned Defense Department aerial surveillance planes over Nigerian territory and sharing commercial satellite images with Nigeria as part of efforts to find the girls, two senior Obama administration officials told CNN's Elise Labott on Monday. China and France are also helping in the search. Israel plans to send a team of counterterrorism experts to help, Jonathan's office said Sunday. The United States has said it has no plans to send combat troops. The U.S. team is working to help the Nigerian military plan operations and boost its capacity, providing investigation and intelligence support, advising on hostage negotiations and other issues, a senior State Department official told Labott. Why did help arrive so late? The United States offered assistance immediately after the mass abductions, but Nigeria turned it down until it became apparent that the situation needed a greater response, senior U.S. State Department officials told CNN. Last week Secretary of State John Kerry said that the United States has been engaged since Day One. An explosive report Friday accused military commanders of knowing the terror group was headed to the school at least four hours in advance. However, the report said, they were unable to raise enough troops to respond. The findings by human rights group Amnesty International mirror accounts by parents and villagers, who described to CNN an ineffective military response in the days and weeks after the abductions. Nigeria's information and defense ministries disputed the report. The moment the Nigerian government heard of the kidnappings, ""we went in to action,"" Information Minister Labaran Maku said. ""We shouldn't turn this into a trial of the Nigerian government."" CNN Exclusive: Nigerian girl who escaped Boko Haram says she still feels afraid . Playing dead allowed him to survive massacre .

"India's president appointed Narendra Modi as the new prime minister of the world's largest democracy Tuesday, the presidential palace said in a statement. Modi succeeds Manmohan Singh, whose Congress party suffered its worst-ever defeat in the recent general elections. President Pranab Mukherjee will administer the oath of office and secrecy to Modi on May 26, the statement said. Earlier in the day, Modi made his maiden visit to the national parliament as a federal lawmaker. In a traditional gesture of supplication to what Indians call their temple of democracy, he bowed down on the first step of the building's entry stairs. After he was officially named leader of his Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) parliamentary group, Modi made a passionate speech in Hindi. In his televised address to BJP lawmakers, he broke down briefly as he hailed both the nation and his party as his ""mother."" ""I have done no favor. Can serving the mother be called a favor?"" he asked, pausing to sip water. ""India is my mother and so is the BJP. You do no favor to your mother. You only serve her,"" he said, his voice choked with emotion. Modi vowed to increase efforts to eradicate poverty, create employment opportunities for the country's young workers and provide a safer environment for women. The BJP has swept the five-phase national elections that concluded on May 12, winning 282 of the 543 seats of the parliament's lower house on its own in what has been a historic mandate for any single party in decades in India.

"Kanye West is paying a price for not ignoring a swarm of paparazzi surrounding him at an airport this past summer. West's lawyer entered a no contest plea Monday on behalf of the rapper to a misdemeanor count of battery against a photographer. A no contest plea is treated the same as a guilty plea for purposes of the sentencing. Judge Alan Rubin sentenced West to serve two years' probation for the misdemeanor battery conviction. He must attend 24 anger management sessions, perform 250 hours of community service and pay restitution to the victim. Rubin said he will review the community service to make sure he is getting no special treatment. Photographer Daniel Ramos told the judge he wanted West thrown in jail. ""I was only doing my job, and he broke the law,"" Ramos said. ""I believe that if I did what he did to me, I would have been put behind bars."" The incident was caught on camera, leaving West with the prospect of a tough trial and the possibility of jail unless he accepted a plea deal from prosecutors that included probation. West was not required to appear in court since the charge was just a misdemeanor. The video recorded the following exchange: . ""Kanye! Kanye! Talk to me, Kanye!"" a photographer shouted outside of a Los Angeles International Airport terminal on the night of July 19, 2013. ""Now come on, Kanye, I don't want to fight with you."" ""I told you, don't talk to me, right. You're trying to get me in trouble so I step off and have to pay you like $250,000."" West is then seen rushing the photographer and attempting to wrestle his camera from his hands.  West retreats after about 15 seconds of scuffling with the photographer. ""I simply asked him a question, and I didn't use any vulgar language,"" Ramos told the judge Monday. ""In fact, I gave him a compliment and told him that he was cool."" Lawyer Gloria Allred has filed a civil suit against West on behalf of the photographer. Beverly Hills Police investigated an incident in January in which West was accused of assaulting a man at a Beverly Hills chiropractor's office.

Three other people were killed in the strike, Pakistani intelligence sources and tribal officials said, describing the incident as a suspected U.S. drone strike in a remote area of Pakistan's Waziristan region, a Taliban stronghold bordering Afghanistan. One missile hit a compound, and another struck a car nearby, the Pakistani sources said. The government of Pakistan issued a statement through its foreign ministry saying it ""strongly condems the U.S. drone strike"" in Waziristan. The statement made no mention of Mehsud, and it was not clear whether the ministry knew of reports that he had been killed when the statement was released. ""The Government of Pakistan has consistently maintained that drone strikes are counter-productive, entail loss of innocent civilian lives and have human rights and humanitarian implications,"" the statement said. Mehsud was buried, though the body was unrecognizable, Taliban sources said. The organization was scheduled to meet Saturday to pick a new leader, the sources said. This is not the first time Mehsud -- who took the reins of the Pakistani Taliban in 2009 -- has been reported killed after a drone strike. In February 2010, multiple sources said he had died after being hit in a drone strike in Pakistan a month earlier. But reports that he was alive surfaced in April of that year, and in May 2010 he appeared in a video vowing attacks on major U.S. cities. The Pakistani Taliban, which has long been conducting an insurgency against the Pakistani government, claimed responsibility for a December 2009 suicide bombing at the United States' Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khost, Afghanistan. The attack killed seven U.S. citizens, including five CIA officers, and a member of Jordanian intelligence. The U.S. Justice Department charged Mehsud in the summer of 2010 for his alleged involvement in the attack, and U.S. officials offered a $5 million reward  for information leading to his capture. The group also claimed responsibility for a failed May 2010 attempt to detonate a car bomb in New York's Times Square. The following September, the U.S. State Department designated the Pakistani Taliban a foreign terrorist organization. Mehsud took over from Baitullah Mehsud, a fellow clan member, in 2009 after the latter was killed in a U.S. drone strike. Elsewhere Friday, armed militants killed six Shiite Muslims in Pakistan's volatile Balochistan province, an incident suspected to be ""sectarian terrorism,"" police said. A seventh person was injured. Four gunmen on two motorcycles opened fire at a vehicle carrying seven Shiite Hazaras in Bolan district, police official Ghullam Hussain said. The shooting was indiscriminate, Hussain said. Three of the victims died at the scene and three more on the way to the hospital. ""The incident seems to be a sectarian terrorism,"" he said. The attackers sped away after the attack. There has been no claim of responsibility.","Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud killed in drone strike, officials say .

"The mother of a 19-year-old accused of killing two people and himself at a Maryland mall told reporters that her son was a ""gentle, sweet kid."" In the conversation, recorded Sunday by a reporter for radio station WNEW, the woman says Darion Aguilar never had a gun before and was a gentle teenager. ""If you were to go into his room you would see what a gentle, sweet kid he was,"" she says. She says she cannot understand what happened and that she doesn't think her 19-year-old son knew the victims. She adds that she feels for the parents of 21-year-old Brianna Benlolo and 25-year-old Tyler Johnson, who were shot dead with a shotgun on Saturday morning at the busy Columbia mall. ABC also reported the mother's comments. The woman's revelations come as police look into a journal written by Aguilar. The diary contains typical teenage writings about acne and rejection by girls, but nothing to indicate he was depressed, a family friend said Monday. Family friend Ellis Cropper, who is serving as a spokesman for Aguilar's mother, told CNN on Monday that police reviewed the journal after the mother called police to file a missing person report. Cropper said Aguilar's mother, with whom he was close, doesn't think he was dating anyone. Police have said only that  Aguilar's  journal expressed ""general unhappiness with his life."" According to police, Aguilar took a taxi to The Mall in Columbia on Saturday morning and then fired as many as nine shots from a Mossberg 500 shotgun into a skateboard apparel shop, killing Benlolo and Johnson before fatally shooting himself. On Saturday, a federal official briefed on the shooting told CNN that preliminary information suggested the gunman aimed only at the two victims, perhaps indicating it was an isolated situation and not a wider shooting spree. Police have offered no motive for the shooting. ""I know there's a lot of interest in the motive for this, and I have as much interest in that as anybody,"" Howard County Police Chief Bill McMahon said Sunday. Aguilar was an avid skateboarder, Cropper said. As of now that's the only known link between him and the skate shop. Prelude to the shooting . According to Cropper, here's what Aguilar's mother says happened before the shooting on Saturday: . Aguilar was scheduled to report to work for a 5:30 a.m. shift at Dunkin' Donuts, a job he had held since about September. His mother offered to give him a ride to work, but he said he would get there on his own. Several hours later, she went to check on him, and the store manager said Aguilar had never showed up, according to Cropper. The mother then called police to file a missing person report. When officers arrived at her home, she used a cell phone locating service to trace her son's phone. It showed he was at the mall. According to Cropper, police -- who were aware of the mall shooting -- then asked if Aguilar kept a journal. Police later returned to the home and seized the journal, along with other potential evidence including computers and documents, according to McMahon, the police chief. McMahon said Aguilar purchased the 12-gauge Mossberg shotgun in December and also had two homemade bombs in his backpack. The victims . Benlolo was an assistant manager at Zumiez. She had worked there since November 2012, according to her Facebook page. Her friend Evelyn McDonald said Benlolo, the mother of a small boy, was ""just full of energy."" ""She was so nice and just an amazing artist and just an amazing person inside and out,"" McDonald told CNN. ""She loved her son. She loved being a mother,"" McDonald said. Johnson had worked at the store for about three months, according to his Facebook page. Five people went to the hospital for treatment after the shooting.  All were treated and released. Four suffered injuries in the chaos after the shooting. The other injured victim suffered a gunshot wound to the foot. Police said the woman wasn't in Zumiez; rather, she was on the first floor when she was hit. The mall reopened Monday afternoon, but the Zumiez store will be closed indefinitely, according to a sign on the boarded up storefront. Memorial sites will be set up outside the mall and in the food court, officials said. It started out as a routine day in busy mall . Man with 'crude' explosives, ammo kills 2 at mall, then self . Gun shop owner recalls conversations with Aguilar . The co-owner of the United Gun Shop in Rockville confirmed Aguilar purchased a shotgun on December 10 for about $430 in cash. Cory Brown, the co-owner, said Aguilar walked in with a friend and after spending about 30 minutes in the store, he was approved to purchase the Mossberg 500. Brown said Aguilar seemed to know what he wanted. ""He came in and asked for something he can use for home defense. A platform he can start with and grow into.  He asked a lot of good questions,"" Brown said. Aguilar showed him a learners permit to drive and a change of address card.  He filled out the ATF form and was approved within minutes. Aguilar also purchased two boxes of ammo for a total of 32 shotgun shells, which each contained about 50 small pellets inside. Brown said Aguilar came back just before Christmas with the same friend and purchased another box of shotgun shells. He said he wanted to practice more with it, telling the gun shop owner, ""there's more kick than I thought."" He purchased another box of shotgun shells for $16. University shootings earlier last week . The shooting was the latest instance of gun violence or threats in ordinary places across the country. A student was shot dead Friday afternoon at South Carolina State University, prompting a manhunt for several suspects that extended beyond the school's Orangeburg campus. On Wednesday, the University of Oklahoma in Norman briefly shut down after a report of a possible shooting that apparently turned out to be a false alarm, the university's president said. On Tuesday, a gunman shot and killed another student inside Purdue University's electrical engineering building. Police said Cody Cousins, 23, an engineering student, killed Andrew Boldt, 21, of West Bend, Wisconsin. Cousins was charged with murder. Last Monday, a student was shot and critically injured near a gym at Widener University near Philadelphia. Police were looking for a suspect.

"Inside their dark, barren home in Dagestan, Zubeidat and Anzor Tsarnaev finally hear the voice they've been longing to hear for weeks. It's the voice of their only surviving son, Dzhokhar. To the outside world, he's suspected of helping to launch a gruesome attack at the Boston Marathon that killed three people and maimed dozens more. But to the Tsarnaevs, Dzhokhar is an innocent teen who has been victimized by the American justice system. In an exclusive interview with CNN affiliate ITN, Zubeidat Tsarnaev plays a recorded phone call with her 19-year-old son.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Campaigners in London planned to petition the British government Friday for a posthumous pardon for the hundreds of people executed for witchcraft between the 16th and 18th centuries. Witchcraft has not been punishable by death for nearly 300 years. They said Halloween is a good time to highlight the ""grave miscarriage of justice"" suffered by the men and women falsely accused of being witches. Their petition asks Justice Minister Jack Straw to recommend that Queen Elizabeth II issue a pardon. ""We felt that it was time that the sinister associations held by a minority of people regarding witches and Halloween were tackled head-on,"" said Emma Angel, head of Angels, a large costume supplier in London. ""We were gobsmacked to discover that though the law was changed hundreds of years ago and society had moved on, the victims were never officially pardoned."" Angels launched a Web site, pardonthewitches.com, to solicit signatures for their petition. They had between 150 and 200 by Friday morning, Angels spokesman Benjamin Webb said, but they hoped Halloween publicity would generate more. Around 400 people were executed in England and some 4,000 in Scotland for alleged witchcraft, campaigners say. The Witchcraft Act of 1735 put an end to trials of accused witches, but many still faced persecution and jail for other crimes such as fraud. ""It shifted from a spiritual thing to more of a criminal thing,"" Webb said, but ""it didn't pardon those people who'd suffered before."" The campaigners worked with witchcraft historian John Callow to detail eight cases they hope will persuade the government to act. They include the case of Ursula Kemp, a woman who offered cures in Essex, England in the 1500s. The uneven results of her work prompted accusations of witchcraft and she was hanged in 1582. A century later, Mary Trembles and Susanna Edwards were begging for food in Exeter, England, when a local woman blamed one of them for an illness and they were jailed. A jail visitor noticed Edwards' shaky hands and suggested she was ""tormenting someone."" It started a string of rumors that resulted in an accusation of witchcraft, and the women were executed in 1682. In 1645, clergyman John Lowes was regarded as too attached to Catholicism in a strongly Reformed area. He had already defended himself once against witchcraft when he came to the attention of a notorious zealot named Matthew Hopkins. Hopkins made Lowes walk for days and nights until he was unable to resistconfessing to being a witch. Lowes was hanged in Bury St. Edmunds, England, after conducting his own funeral. ""Today we are well aware that these individuals were neither capable of harmful magic nor in league with the devil,"" Callow said. He said the endemic poverty of the 16th to 18th centuries put pressure on leaders and the judiciary to blame someone for society's problems -- so they decided to blame witches. ""A lot of these cases were score-settling in local communities,"" Webb said, adding many cases of alleged witchcraft weren't even reported. ""The notion that people could suspend their disbelief and believe that women were talking to toads -- just horrible times. Horrible times."" In 2004, one Scottish town managed to get a pardon for the 81 accused witches that had been put to death there. The independent baron court in Prestonpans, near Edinburgh, pardoned them before the court was officially disbanded in November of that year. In its ruling, the court pardoned both the accused witches and their cats who, it said, were executed for ""conjuration or sorcery."" It said their convictions were based on insufficient evidence that often relied on ""voices"" or the actions of ""spirits"" to attest to their guilt. A separate group petitioned the Scottish parliament last month, asking for pardons for each of the 4,000 witches who were put to death across the nation. Ewan Irvine, a medium with Full Moon Investigations, acknowledged it's unlikely they will get a pardon for every accused witch, so the group is going ahead with a private memorial in Scotland instead. ""It would be an apology to all those accused,"" said Irvine, whose group investigates the paranormal. Webb said while few people today may believe those men and women deserved execution, their stories still generate suspicion and stigma. That extends to modern-day criticism of children dressing as witches at Halloween with the idea that it's evil or connected to the devil, he said. ""Witches were not emissaries of Satan,"" Webb said. ""They were in fact persecuted women and men who deserve a pardon."" A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice would not comment on the case but said the granting of such a pardon is extremely rare. ""To receive a royal pardon, the test is a high one,"" the spokesman said. ""Evidence must prove conclusively that no offense was committed or that the applicant did not commit the offense. It is not enough that the conviction may be unsafe -- the applicant must be technically and morally innocent."" Accused witches were also tried and put to death in the famous Salem witch trials in the U.S. state of Massachusetts in the late 1600s, but all were later pardoned, said Alison D'Amario, director of education at the Salem Witch Museum. The names of 14 were cleared in 1711 after their families applied to the government, D'Amario said. Gov. Foster Furcolo cleared one name in 1957, and then-Gov. Jane Swift cleared the remaining five in 2001, she said. ""Their names are now on a list that makes it seem as though they were innocent, which they surely were,"" D'Amario said.","Petition seeks pardon for UK witches hundreds of years after their deaths .

"The first commercial supply mission by Orbital Sciences Corp.'s unmanned Cygnus spacecraft has docked at the International Space Station, NASA said Sunday. Crew members on the ISS will open the hatch Monday and unload 2,780 pounds of supplies and experiments, the news release said. With the mission, Orbital officially joins SpaceX as a resupply carrier to the space station. Orbital successfully tested a spacecraft with a smaller payload in mid-September. ""From the men and women involved in the design, integration and test, to those who launched the Antares (rocket) and operated the Cygnus, our whole team has performed at a very high level for our NASA customer, and I am very proud of their extraordinary efforts,"" said David W. Thompson, president and chief executive officer of Orbital, in a written statement from the company. The experiments sent up to the six ISS crew members include one that will study how different fuel samples burn in microgravity, which could help designers select future spacecraft materials. The ship took off from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in eastern Virginia on Thursday aboard an Antares rocket. A previous attempt at launch was scrubbed in December because the ISS crew needed time to conduct spacewalks for repairs. It took two hours Sunday morning for the crew to grab the spaceship and attach it to the ISS. The Cygnus craft will be berthed for 37 days before being loaded with trash and sent back to Earth, Orbital said. It will burn up during re-entry over the Pacific Ocean, officials said. Orbital has a $1.9 billion contract with NASA to make eight flights to the space station under the space agency's commercial supply program. NASA hired Orbital and SpaceX to start making cargo runs to the space station after retiring its fleet of space shuttles and turning much of its focus toward exploring deep into the solar system. SpaceX has so far made two of its 12 scheduled flights to the ISS under a $1.6 billion contract. According to NASA's 2014 launch calendar, its next flight is due to launch on February 22 from Cape Canaveral in Florida. Orbital's next mission is scheduled for May 1.","The mission is the first for one of two private companies involved in carrying frieght to the ISS .

"(CNN) -- For many of us, eating out happens more often than we would like to admit. It's only natural that with our busy, can't-catch-a-break lifestyles we farm out cooking to our favorite local restaurants. That's OK -- it's not so much eating out that's the problem. Rather, it's what we eat at restaurants that can cause health issues. Too many carbohydrates, too much fat and too much salt can lead to obesity, Type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cholesterol issues. The problem is, restaurant menus are designed to entice your sense of taste, not tell you whether the foods they're advertising are healthy. But I'm here to take the guesswork out of dining out. Calorie bombs away! The worst chain restaurant dishes are... Fried foods . Restaurant Code Words: Crunchy, tempura, battered, crispy, breaded, crusted, golden, sizzling . If you're making a healthy choice, you're probably not purposely choosing a fried food item. Look for words like crunchy, battered, crispy, breaded, crusted, golden, tempura; some of these options are a double-whammy on your caloric intake because the item is fried with an additional carb-based coating. Fried foods may taste great, but tend to be high in fat and calories -- and deep frying robs food of nutrients. A grilled, baked or roasted 4-ounce chicken breast (the size of a deck of cards) will run you about 170 calories, whereas the deep fried selection can pack a whopping 370 calories. To make matters worse, many restaurants (usually of the fast food variety) use partially hydrogenated oil because it can be reheated and reused over and over again. Partially hydrogenated oil contains trans fats (the worst of the fats) which raises your LDL (bad cholesterol) and lowers your HDL (good cholesterol), leading to a higher incidence of heart disease. Guilt-free eating: 10 nutrition myths debunked . High-sugar foods . Restaurant Code Words: Teriyaki, BBQ, glazed, sticky, honey-dipped . Powdered doughnuts may be self-explanatory on a menu, but options labeled as Teriyaki, BBQ, glazed, sticky or honey-dipped could also be high in added sugars. It is wise to ask if sauces of any kind are made with sugar, including salad dressings and vinaigrettes. Watch out also for meals that are high in carbohydrates. Carbs turn into sugar when they are broken down by your digestive system. The usual suspects are items like pasta, potatoes and rice, but even menu items like ""healthy"" couscous, quinoa and faro are high in carbs and should be eaten with the same moderation as traditional offerings. How much sugar is in that drink? High-calorie foods . Restaurant Code Words: Loaded, stuffed, creamy, cheesy, gooey, smothered, melted, rich, velvety . It's funny how adjectives describing foods can elicit Pavlov's law in even the most rigorous health fanatic. That's the point. Foods described as loaded, stuffed, creamy, cheesy, gooey, smothered, melted, rich and velvety are triggering a ""feeling"" that you get when you eat that particular menu item. Don't fall into the trap! These ""comfort foods"" may take you back in time to a simpler place where a gourmet grilled cheese sandwich on brioche could right all of the wrongs in the world, but the one wrong it won't right is the number of calories packed into one bite. Something described as ""loaded"" or ""stuffed"" is going to also be loaded or stuffed with calories -- and no one wants to feel like a Thanksgiving turkey. Eating out costs you 200 calories . Healthier options . Restaurant Code Words: roasted, baked, braised, broiled, poached, rubbed, seared, grilled, steamed, sautÃ©ed, spiced, seasoned . Chefs at local restaurants everywhere are catching on that Americans are looking for healthier options when dining out. Restaurants that specialize in foods that are ""made-to-order"" or that focus on locally sourced foods will likely have more options. Even some fast-casual restaurants are retooling mainstays and developing new menu items that won't bust your caloric intake for the day. Words like roasted, poached, baked or grilled are your best options -- just don't order the grilled 26-ounce ribeye steak. Don't be afraid to ask questions about the menu, and if nutritional information is available, read through and choose the meal that will balance your health with your desire for something tasty.","There are healthy restaurant menu choices while eating out .

"Australian airline Qantas grounded all its aircraft Saturday in response to a labor dispute, in a step that will disrupt travel for thousands of people. Flights in the air will complete those journeys, the airline said in a statement, but there will be no further domestic or international departures worldwide. The industrial action involves three unions representing air and ground staff. Qantas, the flag carrier for Australia and its largest domestic and international airline, said that all employees involved in the strike would be locked out from Monday evening. ""Pilots, licensed engineers and baggage, ground and catering staff are essential to Qantas operations and the lock-out will therefore make it necessary for all Qantas aircraft to be grounded,"" the airline said. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard told reporters the dispute had ""escalated in a dramatic way"" during the day. As a result, the government had asked Fair Work Australia -- an independent national workplace relations tribunal -- to terminate the industrial action and resolve the dispute itself, she said. A hearing is taking place Saturday night. ""My message to Qantas, the employees and trade unions is: Australians do want to see this dispute sorted out. Qantas is an iconic Australian brand, it is the employer of thousands of Australians, thousands of people rely on it for their livelihoods and we do need this dispute to be brought to an end,"" she said. The move comes at an embarrassing moment for Australia, which is hosting dozens of heads of government and their staff for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth. Gillard said government workers would help those whose flights home were booked with Qantas to make alternative plans. Speaking at a news conference in Sydney, Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said it was a hard decision to ground the fleet but that the airline had been left with no alternative in the face of the unions' ""extreme claim."" Staff involved in the industrial action will be locked-out for as long as it takes, he said, and the unions ""will have to decide how badly they want to damage Qantas."" Grounding its fleet will have a daily financial impact of about 20 million Australian dollars ($21.4 million), Qantas said. Customers booked on Qantas flights should not go to the airport until further notice, the airline said. It will offer travelers full refunds or the chance to rebook. Flights with subsidiaries Jetstar and QantasLink, as well as Qantas flights across the Tasman Sea operated by Jetconnect and freight services, are not affected by the grounding, it said. The unions involved in the dispute reacted angrily to Joyce's statement. Richard Woodward, vice president of the Australian and International Pilots' Union (AIPA), branded it ""a maniacal overreaction."" The decision to ground the Qantas fleet, stranding thousands of passengers around the world, was unnecessary and grossly irresponsible, he said in a statement, adding: ""Alan Joyce is holding a knife to the nation's throat."" Speaking to CNN, he accused Qantas management of ""complete brinkmanship"" and said the company's action -- only announced Saturday -- had been planned for months. The Transport Workers Union of Australia said in on online statement: ""Today's unwarranted and disgraceful snap announcement by Qantas CEO Alan Joyce is designed to destroy Qantas as we have always known it."" The union accused Qantas management of  ""untruths and subterfuge"" in its dealings with staff, in a statement earlier this week. The airline plans to outsource ground jobs, the union says, at a cost of thousands of Australian jobs. The Australian Licensed Aircraft  Engineers union (ALAEA) accused Qantas of lying to the media and putting profits first, in a statement on its website earlier this month. It said the union's industrial action was aimed at ensuring Qantas ""will have less money to set up the overseas operations that will cannibalise Qantas routes and our job security."" Qantas says the weeks-long dispute with staff has already affected more than 70,000 passengers and cost it about 15 million  Australian dollars ($16 million) a week in lost revenue. London's Heathrow airport said only a handful of long-haul Qantas flights had been scheduled to fly Saturday and Sunday, and it had been able to contact passengers to rebook their travel. Qantas, which has its headquarters in Sydney, is the second oldest airline in the world, having marked the 90th anniversary of its foundation last year. It employs about 32,500 people and flies to more than 180 destinations worldwide, according to the company website. For the financial year ending June 2010, it made a post-tax profit of 116 million Australian dollars.","PM Gillard: ""We need this dispute to be brought to an end""

"On March 17, 2011 a drone attack killed at least 40 members of a Wazir tribal Jirga, which was resolving a land ownership dispute among sub-tribes in Waziristan, a mountainous region in northwest Pakistan, according to local media reports. The reports claimed the Jirga was not the intended target and the predator was chasing a car before finally executing five people without any trial or due process near the Jirga. While this predator was hovering in the area, sophisticated cameras allegedly picked up images of a bigger gathering. Without appearing to have any intelligence or knowledge of its target, it fired four more missiles at the congregation. In the same month, a joint investigation by the London-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ) and the Sunday Times newspaper cited Pakistan's military commander in Waziristan at the time, Brigadier Abdullah Dogar: ""We in the Pakistan military knew about the meeting, we'd got the request 10 days earlier. It was held in broad daylight, people were sitting out in Nomada bus depot when the missile strikes came. Maybe there were one or two Taliban at that Jirga -- they have their people attending -- but does that justify a drone strike which kills 42 mostly innocent people?"" Opinion: Drone is Obama's weapon of choice . There should never be doubts. A big gathering in Waziristan does not mean they must be Taliban. To put it in perspective: My clients say drone attacks are now happening almost twice a week on Pakistani soil. Karim Khan, a tribal man by origin and a journalist by profession, is suing the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for U.S.$500 million for ""his loss of blood."" He had only two options when his innocent 18-year-old son and brother, a primary school teacher, were killed in one such drone attack on December 31, 2009: to join the Taliban's war against the U.S. and take his revenge in a customary tribal way, or call on due process, the rule of law and judicial system of his state to gain justice for the wrong done to him. The first option would have continued the cycle of terror, which we witness in Pakistan in the shape of suicide attacks after almost every drone attack. Khan chose the latter and following him, dozens more families have come forth to seek justice through proper legal means. It is time now for the U.S. to respond to these grievances through legal means. Read: When are drone killings illegal? A similar fate awaited Fahim Qureshi, a teenager and another client from North Waziristan. U.S. President Barack Obama, the embodiment of ""change"" and ""hope,"" approved an escalation of the drone strikes in Pakistan by giving the CIA and U.S. military control of the program. Fahim's family house was destroyed by one such attack. The attack on January 23, 2009 resulted in the deaths of seven people present in the house, including three of Fahim's uncles, a cousin, and three family friends. Fahim was seriously injured and lost one eye. According to the New York Times, President Obama was later informed of this attack and civilian killings. The change he brought in was a record escalation of drone strikes in 2009, culminating in 344 attacks at the expense of 3,325 lives to date, according to TBIJ. The escalation would also change Fahim's life forever. The U.S. might never be able to win the ""heart and mind"" of this teenager from Pakistan's tribal area, who paid a high prize for faulty intelligence, a common mistake that CIA makes without any accountability. Under the authority of the U.S. President, drone attacks on Pakistani territory have been carried out by the CIA and U.S. military since 2004. This is an unprecedented move: a foreign government carrying out military strikes on an independent and sovereign state without declaring war. Earlier this year, Christof Heyns, the United Nations' Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, warned that Washington was challenging a system of international law that had existed since the end of World War II and that it could even be guilty of war crimes. The government of Pakistan has consistently maintained that drone attacks are a violation of its territorial integrity and sovereignty. Read: Drones decimating Taliban in Pakistan . What astounds me is the belief expressed by some scholars and politicians that drones are the only viable option for combating terrorism or militancy in the tribal areas of Pakistan. Experience and statistics tell a different story. The first drone attack was carried out in 2004 and had a specific target. This was true for all nine drone attacks that took place until 2007. However, identifying targets became shady as the number of strikes increased. After President Obama's oath of office, the drone attacks saw a sudden surge, accelerating from an average of one strike every 40 days to one every four days by mid-2011, according to the New America Foundation. The TBIJ said available data showed from June 2004 to September 2012, drone strikes have killed 2,570 to 3,337 people in Pakistan, of whom 474 to 884 were civilians -- including 176 children. As a result of these attacks, the U.S. has only been able to achieve 41 high value targets, according to estimates by the New American Foundation. We have seen that with every assassination of militant leaders, they have been replaced with a more ferocious and extremist leader. Meanwhile, journalist Scott Shane told PBS in a response to an article he'd written in the New York Times, ""there's also been some dispute over the way civilian casualties are counted. The CIA often counts able-bodied males, military-age males who are killed in strikes as militants, unless they have concrete evidence to sort of prove them innocent, and some folks at the State Department and elsewhere have questioned that kind of a process."" As a result, most adult males living in Waziristan seem to be viewed as militants and targets until the CIA rates them to be innocent, he added. Pakistan has also experienced a spike in suicide attacks when there has been a surge in drone attacks. In 2010, the year that saw the highest number of drone strikes, according to TBIJ, Pakistan government figures suggest the country witnessed its highest number of suicide attacks -- more than 2,100 civilians were killed without distinction between women, children, law enforcement or military. According to the Pakistan government, the total financial loss from terrorism in Pakistan between 2001-2010 was $68 billion, whereas the epicenter of all this chaos in our midst, the U.S., has given only $11 billion in military aid to Pakistan for its war on terror since 2001, according to the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University. A large portion of this damage is attributed to suicide attacks. America's own losses in Afghanistan -- financial, human, and tactical -- are difficult to quantify. According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), more than $6 billion has been spent since 2002 on establishing a viable Afghan National Police force, which the late Richard Holbrooke called ""an inadequate force riddled with corruption,"" during a meeting in Brussels in 2009. The GAO says more than $10 billion of American taxpayers' money has been spent on building up the Afghan National Army, which was described in a report in the Wall Street Journal on July 28, 2010 as largely corrupt, poorly led, and subject to claims of drug use. The joint NATO and Afghan Operation Moshtrak in Afghanistan's Helmand province in February 2010 failed miserably in achieving its aimed objectives of evicting the Taliban and establishing a government in the district, despite the enormous budget and military backing of the Americans. Earlier this year, U.S. Senator John Kerry concluded that the operation did not become the turning point in the Afghan campaign as anticipated by NATO commanders. In fact 2011-2012 witnessed a surge in Taliban attacks on NATO and particularly American targets, showing there is no end to this war. This cycle of terror will continue until both sides start seeing sense and start adhering to the principles of due process, fair play, and rule of law. Through legal action, Karim Khan -- the first of 80 clients who came to us seeking justice for these attacks -- has shown a new path to his people to end the violence, which is largely attributed to mistakes committed by the state in the 1980s, along with the very same partner who is asking us to commit yet another folly. The American public should ask their government who is being killed in their name. Questioning the drone program in light of real facts is not anti-American -- violating the rule of law, due process and the ""right to life"" is.

"In diplomacy, like in sales, success often depends on making your adversaries believe they proposed the result you wanted. By that measure, Russian President Vladimir Putin appears to have closed the sale on annexing Crimea from Ukraine. On Monday, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev visited the region that Moscow now claims over international protests, while Russia also said it was withdrawing a battalion of infantry troops from the tens of thousands deployed near the border with eastern Ukraine. Meanwhile, diplomatic efforts focus on defusing the immediate threat of armed conflict and setting up a negotiating process, rather than necessarily reversing the Crimean annexation. Here are some questions and answers on how we got here and what to expect: . What's the story? The Ukraine crisis has its roots in the breakup of the Soviet Union more than two decades ago. A country of deep ethnic and cultural divisions, it comprises a more ethnic Russian population in the East and a more ethnic Ukrainian population in the West, including Kiev, the capital. Months of increasingly violent political protests in Kiev over the government's reluctance to expanded relations with the European Union culminated in a February 21 agreement that called for constitutional changes and new elections. Putin says he's pulling some troops back from Ukrainian border . Moscow responded by sending forces into Ukraine's formerly Russian region of Crimea, which is home to Russia's Black Sea fleet. Putin claimed ethnic Russians in Crimea faced oppression and needed Moscow's protection, a scenario rejected as false by Washington and its European allies. Despite objections by the Ukrainian government, the United Nations, European nations and the United States, Russia then engineered a Crimean independence referendum that easily passed. As Washington and the European Union imposed sanctions, Moscow and Crimea took the legislative steps in recent weeks to complete the annexation. Meanwhile, Putin warned Russia would protect ethnic Russians elsewhere from alleged attacks and discrimination, and tens of thousands of Russian troops gathered near Ukraine's eastern border raised fears of an imminent invasion. What's the latest? As tension climbed, Putin called President Barack Obama last Friday and the two leaders agreed that their top diplomats would try to find an opening for negotiations on resolving the crisis. In four hours of talks on Sunday in Paris, Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov focused on easing the border tension and working out a formula for a negotiating process that includes the Ukraine government. Afterward, Kerry told reporters that both governments agreed on the need for a diplomatic solution, and that the goal for now was de-escalating the crisis to allow for further talks. However, he never directly mentioned Crimea or its annexation and he didn't repeat an earlier U.S. demand that Russian troops leave Crimea. ""Both sides made suggestions on ways to de-escalate the security and political situation in and around Ukraine,"" Kerry said. ""We also agreed to work with the Ukrainian government and the people to implement the steps that they are taking to assure the following priorities: the rights of national minorities, language rights, demobilization and disarmament of the regular forces and provocateurs, an inclusive constitutional reform process, and free and fair elections monitored by the international community."" His bottom line? ""No decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine."" Meanwhile, Monday's movement of Russian troops -- whether a real withdrawal or symbolic shift --signaled Moscow's acceptance that the Kerry-Lavrov talks yielded some progress. ""If reports that Russia is removing some troops from the border region are accurate, it would be a welcome preliminary step,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said on Monday. What does it all mean? Two weeks ago, Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov declared that his country was willing to hold talks with Russia, ""but we will never accept the annexing of our territory."" While Kerry alluded to the Crimea annexation on Sunday, calling Russia's ""actions"" illegal and illegitimate, he also noted that ""Russia obviously has long ties and serious interests"" in Ukraine. In tense, defiant Ukraine border region, prayers are for peace -- unless peace fails . In Washington, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California made a similar point earlier Sunday on CNN, saying that Crimea is ""dominantly Russian."" She sounded resolved that the peninsula with a majority ethnic Russian population now had returned to Moscow's provenance, as Putin wanted all along. ""A referendum was passed. That, I think, has been done,"" said Feinstein, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee. ""But Ukraine is a different subject."" Her acknowledgment clashes with Obama and the United Nations, who call the military backed annexation of Crimea a violation of international law and dismiss the Crimean secession referendum as a sham. Obama has threatened further sanctions targeting vital sectors of Russia's economy such as financial services, energy, mining, defense and engineering. However, it remains unclear if European powers such as Germany and Britain would join in such an escalation because of their stronger economic links with Russia. What now? More talks and diplomatic posturing, . The Russian force shift Monday involved several hundred troops at the most, which would be only a fraction of the 40,000 or more estimated to be near the Ukrainian border for what Moscow calls exercises. That means the next steps occur under the shadow of the Russian forces that U.S. military officials say could launch an incursion on short notice. Obama's trump card is the possible increased sanctions targeting strategic sectors of the already struggling Russian economy as Moscow assumes greater costs because of the Crimea annexation. Medvedev said Monday Crimean state salaries and pensions should be raised to Russian levels, as should the pay for military personnel, while compulsory social insurance would be introduced to the region next year. He also said Moscow would make Crimea a special economic zone and review water supply projects for the region that now gets 90% of its water, 80% of its electricity and roughly 65% of its gas from Ukraine. A variety of outcomes remain possible, ranging from further Russian military incursions in other ethnic-Russian strongholds in the region to a negotiated political agreement in which Ukraine adopts a new constitution and holds new elections -- almost certainly minus Crimea.","Secretary of State Kerry cites defusing tensions and setting up talks as goals .

"Former CIA Director David Petraeus testified on Capitol Hill Friday that the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, in September was an act of terrorism committed by al Qaeda-linked militants. That's according to U.S. Rep. Peter King, R-New York, who spoke to reporters after a closed hearing in the House, which lasted an hour and 20 minutes. King said Petraeus' testimony differed from an earlier assessment the former CIA director gave lawmakers just days after the September 11 attack, which left four Americans dead, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens. ""He (Petraeus) ... stated that he thought all along he made it clear that there was significant terrorist involvement, and that is not my recollection of what he told us on September 14,"" King said. ""The clear impression we were given (in September) was that the overwhelming amount of evidence was that it arose out of a spontaneous demonstration, and was not a terrorist attack,"" he said. U.S. officials initially said the violence erupted spontaneously amid a large protest about a privately made video produced in the United States that mocked the Prophet Mohammed. The intelligence community later revised its assessment, saying it believes the attack was a planned terrorist assault. King said that the word spontaneous was minimized during Petraeus' testimony Friday, which was given one week after he resigned from the CIA. Lawmakers said they didn't ask him about why he left the agency. Petraeus has admitted an extramarital affair with his biographer. Critics of the administration have suggested that his resignation might be linked to fallout over the attack. What do we know so far about the Petraeus scandal? The Benghazi attack became a political hot button during a presidential election year and raised questions regarding issues such as security at the compound and the Obama administration's initial description of the events. King told reporters that he likes Petraeus and that it was uncomfortable, at times, to interview a man he considers a friend. ""He was a strong soldier. Very professional, very knowledgeable, very strong,"" King said. ""He's a solid guy. I consider him a friend, which made the questioning tough. You realize the human tragedy here."" After he spoke at the House Intelligence hearing, Petraeus testified in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He was ushered into both sessions without reporters being able to get a camera shot of him, and after he testified he left the premises, CNN learned. Petraeus was not asked to testify under oath, King said. King and other lawmakers said Petraeus testified that his resignation had nothing to do with the consulate attack. That matches what Petraeus told Kyra Phillips of HLN, CNN's sister network. He said his resignation was solely a result of his extramarital affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell. He added that he never passed classified information to her. Prior to Friday's hearings, it was thought that Petraeus would tell lawmakers that the CIA knew soon after the attack that Ansar al Sharia was responsible for it, according to an official with knowledge of the case. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject matter. Ansar al Sharia is more of a label than an organization, one that's been adopted by conservative Salafist groups across the Arab world. Related: What is Ansar al Sharia? It was not known whether Petraeus spoke specifically about Ansar al Sharia during Friday's sessions. After the House committee hearing, Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, D-Maryland, said the confusion over the consulate incident arose from there being essentially two threads of violence: one caused by the protest, which was chaotic, and a second that was orchestrated by terrorists, which was highly coordinated. There were ""two different types of situations at play,"" Ruppersberger said, explaining that in the hours and days after the attack, it was naturally difficult to clearly discern what happened. Intelligence evolves, he said, and new information comes out when agents obtain it. He played down the idea that there was something untoward going on. Petraeus: I did not pass on classified information . The former CIA chief has said there was a stream of intelligence from multiple sources, including video at the scene, that indicated Ansar al Sharia was behind the attack, according to an official with knowledge of the situation. Meanwhile, separate intelligence indicated the violence at the consulate was inspired by protests in Egypt over an ostensibly anti-Islam film clip that was privately produced in the United States. The movie, ""Innocence of Muslims,"" portrayed the Prophet Mohammed as a womanizing buffoon. There were 20 intelligence reports that indicated that anger about the film may be to blame, the official said. The CIA eventually disproved those reports, but not before Petraeus' initial briefing to Congress when he discussed who might be behind the attack and what prompted it. During that briefing, he raised Ansar al Sharia's possible connection as well as outrage about the film, the official said. Earlier, an official said that Petraeus' aim in testifying was to clear up ""a lot of misrepresentations of what he told Congress initially."" Petraeus testified that he developed unclassified talking points in the days after the attack but he had no direct involvement in developing the ones used by Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, King said. ""No one knows, yet, exactly who came up with the final version of the talking points, other than to say the original talking points prepared by the CIA were different from the ones that were finally put out,"" said King, stressing that the original talking points were more specific about al Qaeda involvement. Rice has been under fire for suggesting the attack on the consulate was a spontaneous event spurred by a protest against the anti-Muslim film. The three unclassified talking points that were used by Rice on September 16 were read aloud to reporters on the Hill Friday. They are: . -- The currently available information suggests that the demonstrations in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the US Embassy in Cairo and evolved into a direct assault against the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi and subsequently its annex. There are indications that extremists participated in the violent demonstrations. -- This assessment may change as additional information is collected and analyzed and as currently available information continues to be evaluated. -- The investigation is ongoing, and the U.S. government is working with Libyan authorities to bring to justice those responsible for the deaths of U.S. citizens. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who leads the Intelligence Committee, read the points to journalists and vigorously defended Rice. Feinstein said lawmakers should be careful not to ""pillory"" someone for intelligence failings. ""We have seen wrong intelligence before and it all surrounded our going into Iraq, and a lot of people were killed based on bad intelligence,"" she said. ""And I don't think that is fair game.  I think mistakes get made.  You don't pillory the person. ""To select Ambassador Rice because she used an unclassified talking point, to say that she is unqualified to be secretary of state, I think, is a mistake,"" the senior lawmaker said. ""And the way it keeps going it is almost as if the intent is to assassinate her character."" There has been speculation that Rice was among the people being considered as a replacement for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, if she steps down as she has indicated. But the committee's senior Republican, Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, said he doesn't think the issue is settled. He said the concern is not whether the talking points were correct, but that Rice didn't go far enough. ""She knew at that point and time that al Qaeda was very likely responsible in part or in whole for the death of Ambassador Stevens,"" he said, intimating that Rice should have said that.

"(CNN) -- I once took care of an 84-year-old woman with end-stage heart failure who told me she couldn't bear feeling short of breath any longer and pleaded with me to help her die. ""Is November 15 a good day for you?"" she asked. Her daughter shot out of a chair at her bedside. ""Ma, do you understand what you are saying?"" The old lady stared at her and nodded slowly. ""I can't take it anymore,"" she said. ""Back and forth, back and forth to the hospital. I'd rather be dead."" I explained that in New York state I could not assist in her suicide, though I could give her morphine to relieve her suffering. ""If you were like me, you'd say the same thing, doctor,"" she said ruefully. ""I'm half gone. Nobody wants to bother with you when you're like this."" A couple of days later, I went to the ethics committee at my hospital. I explained that surgeons had deemed my patient's condition inoperable. Over the past couple of months she had been hospitalized several times with extreme shortness of breath due to congestive heart failure and treated with intravenous drugs. When the drugs were stopped, her heart failure symptoms quickly returned. This cycle was repeated several times before the day she asked me to help her die. ""She just doesn't want to suffer anymore,"" I said. ""She doesn't want to go through another episode of heart failure. She is absolutely terrified of it."" ""I don't see the big ethical dilemma,"" a senior internist said. ""Put her on a morphine drip to relieve her suffering."" ""But she isn't currently suffering,"" I replied. ""So put her on a low dose and titrate it up when she develops symptoms."" The problem was that she could go into a heart failure exacerbation very quickly. She could suffer for hours before her shortness of breath was brought under control, and that was in the hospital where nurses were with her around the clock. In the end, I put my patient on a morphine drip. With her and her family's permission, we arranged for home hospice care. But she never made it out of the hospital. I thought of this patient when reading a terribly sad column on CNN.com by Brittany Maynard, a 29-year-old with brain cancer who moved to Oregon so she can legally get a prescription for a drug that will end her life. Unfortunately, there are examples (though rare) where palliative or hospice care cannot adequately address the anxiety and suffering of dying patients. For example, in the case of my elderly patient, how can one start morphine in a patient who isn't suffering at that precise moment? For such patients in those rare cases, I support assisted suicide as practiced in Oregon. Through Oregon's Death with Dignity Act, passed in 1997, more than 1,100 people have obtained life-ending prescriptions. About 750 have used them. The law does provide safeguards against clinically depressed or mentally incompetent patients getting lethal drugs to end their lives. Four other states have enacted similar laws. However, I still believe that for most terminally ill patients, hospice care is a better option than assisted suicide. Hospice offers team-based care with family involvement, often in a patient's home, that focuses on pain management and dying with some comfort and dignity. Hospice staff is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The modern hospice movement started in 1967, when Dame Cicely Saunders, a nurse, opened St. Christopher's Hospice in London. Saunders formulated three principles for easing the process of dying: relief of physical pain, preservation of dignity, and respect for the psychological and spiritual aspects of death. The number of American hospitals offering palliative care has nearly doubled since 2000, growing to nearly 1,500 programs -- the majority of hospitals. Perhaps the most surprising finding from these programs is that hospice patients live a month longer on average than similar patients who do not receive such care. Unlike hospice care, assisted suicide is obviously a final and irreversible act. Ruling out the presence of clinical depression that may cloud a patient's judgment is not always straightforward. When depression lifts, the desire to die often lifts too. Only between 10% and 15% of people who attempt suicide eventually die by their own hands, suggesting that the desire to die is often changeable. As a doctor, I would like assisted suicide to be safe and available, but rare. Managing end-of-life care for patients like Brittany Maynard is never simple. I often think of what the elderly woman with terminal heart disease who asked me to help her die told me: ""My husband said the hardest thing to do is to die; I always thought it would be easy.""","Dr. Sandeep Jauhar says patient asked him for help dying; daughter was horrified .
He says he gets terminal patient Brittany Maynard's desire to die, supports choice in rare cases .

"After months of intense political rumors, China's ruling Communist Party announced Tuesday an official probe into a retired senior leader for suspected ""serious disciplinary violation."" Zhou Yongkang, the former domestic security czar, was placed under investigation in accordance with Party regulations, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said in a one-line statement without elaborating. Before stepping down in late 2012, Zhou, 71, was one of the nine members that formed the Politburo Standing Committee, China's top decision-making body that effectively rules the country of more than 1.3 billion people. Under his watch, the domestic security budget swelled to surpass that of the military in the name of ""maintaining stability,"" as a widening income gap between the rich and the poor as well as growing discontent over official corruption fueled social unrest nationwide. Amid an intensifying anti-corruption campaign launched by President Xi Jinping, many political analysts and ordinary citizens have noted ties between an increasing number of disgraced officials and Zhou in recent months. Zhou himself had been rumored to be under house arrest before Tuesday's announcement. The Xi Jinping cipher: Reformer or a 'dictator'? State media have reported official anti-corruption probes into many of Zhou's family members as well as former associates in the domestic security apparatus, state oil industry and southwestern Sichuan province -- three places Zhou once ruled. Three of his former senior aides were arrested early this month. If indicted, Zhou would become the highest-ranking official ever to face corruption charges in the history of the People's Republic. ""It's almost certain the he would be put on trial and appear in public,"" said Professor Willy Lam with Chinese University of Hong Kong, a longtime commentator on Chinese politics. ""The important thing is that Xi Jinping has proven he's powerful enough to break this taboo of never incriminating former Politburo Standing Committee members -- and in the future he can use this anti-corruption card to thrash his political enemies."" The news on Zhou came on the heels of the downfall of several former high-ranking officials, including a retired top general of the 2 million-strong People's Liberation Army. Gen. Xu Caihou, a former vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, which runs the world's largest standing army, was expelled from the Communist Party and handed over to prosecutors after being found to have accepted bribes, state-run Xinhua news agency reported early this month. Xu was also a member of the Politburo before retiring in 2012. State media have characterized Xu as a big ""military tiger"" caught in the massive anti-graft campaign spearheaded by Xi, who is also the commander-in-chief. Xi banned official extravagance -- from banquets to year-end gifts -- and vowed to target ""tigers and flies"" alike in his fight against corruption. He resolved to spare no one, regardless of position. CCTV recently touted the capture of 35 ""tigers"" since Xi took power less than two years ago. Some 182,000 officials were disciplined in 2013, while courts nationwide tried 23,000 corruption cases, according to the Communist Party's disciplinary commission. State media have cited the trial and conviction last year of former high-flying politician Bo Xilai -- a protégé of Zhou -- as a prime example of Xi's determination to clean up the party, though Bo supporters called the case against him politically motivated. ""Now everybody is really scared -- and this would have a big impact on the behavior of senior Party members,"" said Lam, the political analyst. ""But nobody expects corruption to be eradicated. It is built into the system, a system without checks and balances.""","""It's almost certain"" Zhou would be put on trial, a longtime political observer says .

"The mayors of two major cities have opted out of marching in their cities' St. Patrick's Day parades, in what they call a show of support for gay groups that have historically been excluded from the events. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio will not march in Monday's parade in Manhattan, and Boston Mayor Martin Walsh sat out Sunday's parade in South Boston. ""I simply disagree with the organizers of that parade in their exclusion of some individuals in this city,"" de Blasio said at a news conference last month. ""I will be participating in a number of other events to honor the Irish heritage of this city and the contributions of Irish-Americans,"" he added. The former public advocate did not participate in the parade before becoming mayor, either. The New York City mayor hosted a St. Patrick's Day breakfast at Gracie Mansion on Monday morning and attended Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral. Walsh made his last-minute decision Sunday, the day of the parade. ""I'm disappointed that this year, I will be unable to participate in the parade,"" he said early Sunday. ""As mayor of the city of Boston, I have to do my best to ensure that all Bostonians are free to participate fully in the civic life of our city,"" he added.

Organizers of the New York City parade did not immediately return calls for comment.

"Tens of thousands of anti-government protesters marched in Moscow on Tuesday, rejecting the legitimacy of President Vladimir Putin and demanding new elections, a prominent opposition leader said. ""We believe that his presidency right now is not legitimate at all,"" former Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov told CNN from the rally. The elections in March that returned Putin to the presidency after four years as prime minister ""were not free, they were not fair and the results were not credible,"" Kasyanov said. The only thing that Putin should do now is ""sit with us on a round table and discuss the terms and conditions of his departure,"" Kasyanov said. International observers said in March that the elections did not meet international standards. The presidential election came just months after allegations of fraud in parliamentary elections prompted the largest anti-government demonstrations Russia had seen in two decades. Kasyanov called for more street demonstrations to increase pressure on Putin, but said the opposition was not trying to mimic the Arab Spring. ""The best way is just peaceful protests on the streets,"" he said. ""We would like something like what happened at the end of the '80s in eastern Europe"" when Communist regimes fell without violence in the face of public dissent. The demonstration finished without violence and with noticeably less police presence than at a protest before Putin's inauguration last month. More than 250 people were arrested at that demonstration, including leading opposition figure Boris Nemtsov, leftist radical group leader Sergei Udaltsov and popular blogger Alexei Navalny, Moscow police told CNN. In March, Putin won the country's presidential election with nearly 65% of the vote, claiming victory amid allegations by independent polling monitors of widespread electoral violations. International observers said there was legitimate uncertainty about the vote, with chess champion-turned opposition activist Garry Kasparov accusing Putin's supporters of ""massive fraud.""

"Russia's foreign minister said Saturday that a deal with Iran on its nuclear program is close, warning the opportunity to bring about an end to a decade-long standoff must not be passed up. The statements by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov broadcast on Russian TV come just days before negotiators meet in Geneva, Switzerland, to discuss details about Iran's nuclear program. ""Our common impression is that there is a very good chance now which should not be missed,"" Lavrov said in remarks broadcast on state-run TVC. The assessment, Lavrov said, came out of recent talks with the European Union's foreign policy chairwoman, Catherine Ashton. That tone was echoed earlier in the week by the United States. The United States and other countries are ""getting close"" to an interim deal with Iran that would prevent its nuclear program ""from advancing, and roll it back"" in key areas, a senior U.S. administration official said Friday. Such a deal would ""extend the breakout time"" that Iran would need to achieve a nuclear weapon and ""shorten the time to notice if they tried,"" the official said on condition of anonymity. The proposed deal covers every aspect of Iran's nuclear program, including uranium enrichment, uranium stockpiles and all nuclear facilities including military ones, the official said. The deal will be on the table during the next round of talks in Geneva. ""I don't know if we'll reach an agreement. I think it is quite possible that we can. But there are still tough issues to negotiate,"" the official said. The United States, along with the four other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany -- the so-called P5+1 -- came close to a deal during talks with Iran last week in Geneva, but the discussions ended with both sides blaming each other for the lack of an agreement. The P5+1 is ""completely and totally unified"" on the current outlines of the proposed deal, the official said. It is widely believed that Iran harbors aspirations to produce nuclear weapons. Repeated findings by U.N. weapons inspectors indicate that the country appeared to be conducting nuclear weapons research. Iran has always maintained that its nuclear program is for purely peaceful purposes. Even though Iran has denied working toward nuclear weapons, it has said it will not submit to any plan that would totally eliminate its nuclear program.","Russian Foreign Minister expresses hope for a compromise with Iran .

Miranda Barbour told Scarcella, a reporter for the Daily Item newspaper in Sunbury, that she'd killed before. And not just once or twice. ""She said, she has, you know, done this before,"" Scarcella told CNN affiliate WNEP of his Friday interview with the 19-year-old murder suspect. ""And I said, 'What's the actual number?'"" ""And she said, 'Under a hundred,'"" Scarcella told the station. Barbour said she had stopped counting at 22 killings, according to Scarcella's story in the Daily Item. ""She kind of floored me,"" Scarcella told CNN affiliate WBRE. Barbour told the Daily Item that the killings occurred over the past six years in Alaska, Texas, North Carolina and California. That's sent investigators in those states back to their cold-case files, but it's also raising questions among people who study serial killers. ""Anything is possible, and of course it's conceivable that she's a serial killer,"" Northeastern University criminologist Jack Levin told CNN. But he said few women are serial killers, and those few are typically older and don't use knives, as Barbour is accused of doing in the Pennsylvania case. Authorities haven't yet corroborated any of Barbour's claims, including statements that she was involved in Satanism. Her alleged confession has raised questions among attorneys, missing persons experts and even a representative of the Church of Satan, the nation's largest satanic body. ""Thorough investigation will likely demonstrate that this cult story is fiction,"" said Peter Gilmore, the New York-based head of the Church of Satan. In Alaska, state police are looking into the claims and will pursue ""any leads that may present themselves,"" Department of Public Safety spokeswoman Megan Peters told CNN. And Monica Caison, the founder of a missing persons center in North Carolina, said her phone started ringing Sunday night with questions from families whose loved ones haven't turned up in years. ""It sends everybody into a panic mode -- a hopeful panic mode,"" Caison said. ""They want to be one of those, but they don't want to be one of those. They want their nightmare to end."" Police: Newlyweds lure man through Craigslist for thrill killing . 2013 killing . In the one case in which authorities say they have pinned down Barbour's involvement, she and her husband, Elytte Barbour, 22, are accused of killing 42-year-old Troy LaFerrara, who police say responded to a ""companionship"" ad placed by Miranda Barbour on Craigslist. The couple just wanted to kill someone together, police said. They had been married for only three weeks at the time of the slaying, and had moved from North Carolina to Pennsylvania after tying the knot. Police say Elytte Barbour strangled LaFerrara in the front seat of her red Honda CR-V while Miranda Barbour stabbed him at least 20 times in November 2013. LaFerrara's body was found the next day in the backyard of a home in Sunbury, a small city about 100 miles northwest of Philadelphia. The last number dialed on his cell phone led police to the Barbours, according to authorities. Barbour claimed she began killing when she was 13 and involved in a satanic cult, Scarcella reported. ""I can pinpoint on a map where you can find them,"" he quoted her as saying of the bodies. But she said LaFerrara's killing was the Barbours' first as a couple. Elytte Barbour told police at the time of his arrest that he and his wife had tried to kill others, but the plans didn't work out. Both Barbours face several charges in LaFerrara's death, including murder. Despite Miranda Barbour's statements to Scarcella, both have pleaded not guilty. Barbour's attorney, public defender Edward Greco, told CNN he didn't know she was planning to give the interview. He declined to comment on her claims. But Levin said the way LaFerra's body was left in someone's yard isn't typical of serial killers. ""If you're a prolific serial killer, you're going to go out of your way to dump the body in a desolate area off a highway so that people don't find the evidence,"" he said. Satanists: Accused Craigslist killer not one of us . Claims raise doubts . Sunbury Police Chief Steve Mazzeo told CNN that investigators have been in contact with the FBI and law enforcement in some of the states where Barbour has lived. The father of Barbour's 1-year-old child is dead, and Sunbury police have said that is part of their investigation. ""We investigate all leads just because that's the proper protocol to follow through,"" Mazzeo said. Authorities also are looking closely at Barbour's claims that she was involved in Satanism, according to another law enforcement source close to the investigation. But Gilmore, of the Church of Satan, said his church has a ""law and order philosophy"" that does not condone killing. He said the church has had no contact with Miranda Barbour or her husband. Caison, the founder of the Wilmington-based Community United Effort Center for Missing Persons, has worked with murderers before in hopes of bringing closure to people whose loved ones haven't been seen in years. In 2009, her organization helped find the body of Alice Donovan, who was abducted and murdered seven years earlier, after Donovan's convicted killer wrote to tell Caison where the remains could be found. ""Anytime anything like this happens, we start getting e-mails and phone calls. I started getting texts last night,"" Caison said. But she said Barbour will have to be questioned extensively by investigators before those claims can be put to the test. ""You can't just say you've killed 22 people between this region and that region,"" Caison said. ""You've got to give a town or something that only police or an organization like us would know."" Without details like the gender, age or race of a victim, ""We don't even know where to start,"" she said. And like Levin, she cast doubt on Barbour's claims. ""That's a lot of people to kill in such a short time, and being so young and never making a mistake, I'm hard pressed to believe that amount,"" she said. And for the families she works with, ""You don't want to build any false hope."" Getting the interview . Scarcella told WNEP he got the interview after Barbour sent him a letter saying she wanted to talk. Scarcella told CNN on Sunday that he was not allowed to bring a notepad or any other recording device into the interview. He said police allowed him to listen to the interview after it was conducted. In his interview with WNEP, Scarcella described Barbour as ""very meek, very mild"" with a ""very low voice."" ""She never hesitated once,"" he told the station. ""She never gave the impression of it was a rehearsal."" Scarcella said he eventually asked if she had any remorse. ""And she said, 'None,'"" Scarcella told WNEP. But that's not what Scarcella said he found most surprising. That would be, he said, ""the fact that she said that if she got out she would do it again.""

"Actor Stephen Baldwin pleaded guilty to repeated failure to file income taxes for three years and will pay $300,000 in back taxes, his attorney Russell Yankwitt said Friday. Baldwin initially needed to pay $400,000 in back taxes, interest and penalties, but the court waived interest and penalties, which brought the total to $350,000, Yankwitt said. The court then reduced that amount to $300,000, for which Baldwin was very grateful, Yankwitt said. If Baldwin pays back the money within a year, the charge will be taken off his record, the attorney said. If not, Baldwin will be sentenced to five years' probation and have five years to repay the money, Yankwitt said. ""Mr. Baldwin is a man of faith, and it's difficult for him to get jobs in Hollywood that are compatible with his faith, and that's one of the difficulties he's had paying off the money,"" Yankwitt said. Though Baldwin is on ""The Apprentice,"" the money from that appearance is permanently going to a charity, Yankwitt said. ""Mr. Baldwin is very appreciative of the D.A. Office's willingness to work with him, and he looks forward to repaying the debt and being a productive member of society,"" Yankwitt added. The charge was a result of an investigation conducted by the Rockland County, New York, Special Investigations Unit and the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, authorities said. Baldwin was arrested in December on charge of failing to file taxes in 2008, 2009 and 2010 and released on his own recognizance. Baldwin had trusted paid professionals to handle his affairs, especially during the time he was on an island shooting the reality TV show ""Survivor,"" Yankwitt said previously. Baldwin produced a check for $100,000 in December as a ""good faith"" down payment on the money he owed, Yankwitt said.

"(CNN) -- FIFA executive committee member Angel Villa Llona has defended football's world governing body against recent media allegations of corruption. Speaking during his country Spain and Portugal's final presentation on Thursday to jointly host the 2018 World Cup, Villa Llona described reports against his organization as slanderous and said that it was ""clean."" ""Recently we have been criticized by many media outlets. Unfortunately for them FIFA is a clean institution,"" the 60-year-old said, just hours ahead of the vote to decide the hosts of the 2018 and 2022 tournaments. ""You have already heard enough slander in the media, the bidding process is clean regardless of what they say."" Two members of the executive committee and four other officials were suspended by FIFA last week following an investigation by British newspaper The Sunday Times. This week the BBC's Panorama program claimed another three current executive committee members had accepted bribes more than a decade ago. But in a passionate speech, with Spain's prime minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero and his Portuguese counterpart Jose Socrates in attendance at FIFA headquarters in Switzerland, Villa Llona denied that any of the now 22-strong committee were guilty of corruption. ""I love FIFA dearly but those I love the most are my colleagues in the ExCo,"" Villa Llona said. ""FIFA values honesty, FIFA works for football and for the world, and all my colleagues here present are all honest, hard-working football people and the people not here are also honest and hard-working."" The Iberian bid's three rivals -- Holland-Belgium, Russia and England -- also gave their final presentations at the FIFA headquarters in Zurich on Thursday. England's bid -- which some believe has been damaged by the revelations in the British press -- was bolstered by speeches from prime minister David Cameron, soccer superstar David Beckham and Prince William. The Russian delegation were without their prime minister Vladimir Putin, who on Wednesday complained of an unfair bidding process at FIFA, but the bid was injected with a touch of glamour after the arrival of model Natalia Vodianova and Olympic pole-vault champion Yelena Isinbayeva. Meanwhile, underdogs Holland and Belgium rolled out Dutch footballing greats Johan Cruyff and Ruud Gullit to put their bid back in the spotlight. The candidates for the 2022 World Cup -- Australia, Korea, Japan, the U.S. and Qatar -- gave their final presentations in Switzerland on Wednesday.","Spanish executive committee member Angel Villa Llona insists FIFA is a clean organization .

"Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Wednesday took on Republican congressional critics of her department's handling of the deadly September terrorist attack in Libya. Conservative GOP members challenged Clinton on the lack of security at the diplomatic compound in Benghazi as well as the erroneous account that the attack grew spontaneously from a protest over an anti-Islam film produced in the United States. At two hearings, which together totaled more than five hours, Clinton acknowledged a ""systemic breakdown"" cited by an independent review of issues leading up to the armed assault and said her department was taking additional steps to increase security at U.S. diplomatic facilities. Here are five things we learned from the hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations and House Foreign Affairs committees. Read more: Clinton takes on Benghazi critics . 1. What Clinton did the day of the Benghazi attack . Clinton spent the better part of last September 11 trying to get a handle on security at several other U.S. embassies in the Middle East where anti-American protests were in full swing over an anti-Muslim film produced in the United States. She said the U.S. embassy was ""under assault"" by crowds trying to scale the wall. American embassies in Yemen and Tunisia were also facing a ""serious threat. Clinton personally called the president of Tunisia, she said, to ""beg him to send reinforcements, which he did, to finally save our embassy."" By 4 p.m. that day, Clinton was notified about the Benghazi attack. In the coming hours, she was in meetings and spoke with staff, the American Embassy in Tripoli and other U.S. officials. Directing the U.S. response from the State Department, Clinton stayed in touch with officials across the administration and with the Libyan government. She instructed her staff to ""consider every option, to just break down the doors of the Libyan officials to get as much security support as we possibly could."" Clinton said in the hours and days following the attack in Benghazi, there were ""no delays in decision-making. No denials of support from Washington or from our military,"" something an independent board established to review the matter cited in its report. #whatdifferencedoesitmake: Clinton quote goes viral on Twitter . 2. U.S. diplomatic posts in some 20 countries under threat . Clinton said threats to U.S. diplomatic posts are ongoing. ""Sitting here today, we probably have at least 20 other posts that are under a serious threat environment as I speak to you,"" she told senators. ""We operate in places where we know that our facilities are being surveilled for potential attacks where we have a steady Intel stream of plotting."" Clinton detailed what the State Department has done to begin implementing the 29 recommendations of the Accountability Review Board to improve security at diplomatic posts in high-threat areas, in addition to a few of her own. Opinion: Benghazi blame game is useless . Specifically, Clinton has appointed a team, led by her deputy, to focus on tightening security, sent joint teams of military special forces and diplomatic security threat analysts to more than a dozen high-risk posts and appointed a senior official to focus exclusively on those areas. The State Department is also working to streamline requests for security so they make their way more quickly up the chain of leadership. Despite the threat, Clinton stressed the importance of U.S. leadership and diplomatic presence in the Middle East. ""We've come a long way in the past four years, and we cannot afford to retreat now,"" Clinton told senators. ""When America is absent, especially from unstable environments, there are consequences. Extremism takes root, our interests suffer, our security at home is threatened."" Read more: Pentagon releases official timeline of Benghazi attack . 3. Clinton not shying away from a fight . Clinton grew emotional and held back tears when talking about U.S. personnel killed in the Benghazi attack. ""For me, this is not just a matter of policy, it's personal. I stood next to President Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews,"" Clinton said as she choked back tears. ""I put my arms around the mothers and fathers, the sisters and brothers, the sons and daughters, and the wives left alone to raise their children."" But she lost patience with the focus of Republican senators on talking points used by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice on the next Sunday's talk shows that focused on a protest at the U.S. post in Benghazi, which turned out not to have taken place. Opinion: Rand Paul vs. Hillary Clinton, clash of titans . When Sen. Ron Johnson pressed Clinton on why the State Department didn't call U.S. personnel who were evacuated from Benghazi to determine whether there was a protest, Clinton took him to task. ""With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans,"" Clinton reminded Johnson as she banged her hand on the table. ""Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they'd go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening,"" she said. Photos: Hillary Clinton through the years . 4. Militants in Mali and Algeria have arms from Libya . Clinton warned the security situation in northern Mali, where international forces are battling militants, has been exacerbated by flow of weapons from neighboring Libya following the fall of Moammar Gadhafi. She said there was ""no doubt"" such weapons were also used in an attack by militants on an Algerian natural gas plant last week. She noted the aftermath of the Arab spring has changed power dynamics and stretched security forces across the region thin. Calling the campaign struggle against the Islamic fighters a necessary response to ""a very serious, ongoing threat,"" Clinton said the ""United States cannot permit northern Mali to become a safe-haven for Islamist rebels that could eventually pose a more direct threat to U.S. interests."" Noting the increased strength of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the regional affiliate of the al Qaeda network fighting along side local Malians, Clinton warned that the United States must prepare for the possibility that groups like AQIM could threaten direct attacks on U.S. interests as they gain power. ""You can't say because they haven't done something they're not going to do it,"" Clinton said. ""This is not only a terrorist syndicate, it is a criminal enterprise. So make no mistake about it, we've got to have a better strategy."" Read more: Clinton lays out daunting security challenges in North Africa . 5. Republicans still aren't buying it . While their tone was generally respectful, several Republican senators made clear they were unsatisfied with Clinton's answers. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, one of the administration's toughest critics since the Benghazi attack, took Clinton to task for what he considered lackluster attention to the growing threat in Benghazi. McCain wanted to know why Clinton hadn't read a cable from Ambassador Christopher Stevens warning that the mission in Benghazi could not survive a sustained assault. Sen. Rand Paul said it would have been an offense worthy of firing Clinton had he been president. McCain also blasted Clinton's answers to questions about the administration's claim that a protest had taken place in Benghazi. ""The American people deserve to know answers, and they certainly don't deserve false answers,"" McCain told Clinton. Clinton was more diplomatic with her old friend, saying she respected his strong feelings for the incident given his own relationship with Stevens, but that they disagreed about what happened and when it happened with respect to explaining events. In addition to lessons the State Department learned about improving security at diplomatic posts, Clinton, who called the Benghazi attack an act of terrorism since Day One, suggested the administration might learn another lesson. ""Just withhold. Don't say what you don't know for sure until it's finally decided.""

"Scores of Japanese citizens filed a lawsuit Monday in an effort to block the restarting of a nuclear power facility as tensions remain over atomic energy in the country a year after the Fukushima Daichi disaster. The suit, filed at Osaka District Court by a group of 259 citizens, seeks an injunction to stop the company Kansai Electric from bringing its nuclear power plants Oi Unit 3 and 4 back online, according to Green Action, an organization that campaigns against nuclear energy in Japan. The Kansai Electric facility in question is in the central prefecture of Fukui. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant was knocked offline after the massive earthquake and tsunami that struck the east coast of Japan on March 11, 2011. That resulted in a meltdown of three reactors, with radiation leaking into the air and contaminated water spilling into the sea. While no deaths were attributed to the nuclear crisis -- the worst since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster -- more than 100,000 people remain displaced from the towns where its fallout settled. It has left lingering unease among Japanese people about the use of nuclear power to meet the country's energy needs. The government began safety inspections of the country's nuclear power plants. Of Japan's 54 reactors, only two are currently operating. Green Action also held a rally after filing the lawsuit against Kansai Electric. Ahead of the suit, Kansai Electric declined to comment on the matter.","A group of citizens seeks an injunction to block the restart of a nuclear facility .

"Bilal Bettamer is a 23-year-old student who wants to save Benghazi from those he calls ""extremely dangerous people."" But his campaign against the criminal and extremist groups that plague the city has put his life at risk, and he says that if he receives more threats, he will have to leave Libya. Libya can't afford to lose the likes of Bettamer. A law graduate and civil activist, he helped organize the protest against jihadist groups after the attack on the U.S. Consulate there in September, in which four Americans were killed. That protest led to the expulsion from Benghazi of the militant Ansar al-Sharia group -- whose members were suspected of involvement in the attack -- and other jihadists from the city. A month later, Bettamer says, the extremists were back in Benghazi with a vengeance. He estimates there are maybe 100 of them at large. And last week, several European governments, as well as Canada and Australia, urged their citizens to leave this eastern Libyan city immediately, with Britain speaking of an ""imminent threat."" One Libyan source with contacts in Western intelligence circles says the warning followed an intercepted communication that revealed a specific and concrete plan to attack British interests. Fighting a ghost . Bettamer says Ansar al Sharia has expelled its more militant members and is now helping provide security at the western entrance to Benghazi. ""People describe every extremist now as Ansar al Shariah, [but] there are people more extreme and more dangerous,"" he says. Bettamer says he received three hostile text messages after the Save Benghazi Friday protest. ""You feel the threat and feel you are being watched; they follow you and you feel something abnormal."" A ""religious-looking man"" had approached Bettamer's uncle outside their family home in Benghazi with a message for Bilal: ""Tell him to watch out."" The trouble is, no one knows who the assailants are. ""It's like fighting a ghost,"" Bettamer says. Bettamer says police and security forces are gradually getting better and that ordinary people in Benghazi are relatively safe. That's not so for activists or members of the security forces, who are often targeted for assassination. The past three months have seen several assassinations, bombings and kidnappings of police and security officials in Benghazi. Among them was the abduction earlier this month of the head of the criminal investigation division, Abdel Salam al-Mehdawi. He'd been investigating the murder of Benghazi's chief of police in October and is still missing. Last week, Naji El-Hariri, the nephew of a leading figure in the Libyan revolution, was shot in Benghazi's Al Laithi neighborhood, where a senior police officer was killed a week earlier by a bomb. And earlier this month, gunmen ambushed the car of the Italian consul in Benghazi, Guido De Sanctis. He escaped injury, but the Italians suspended their diplomatic presence. State of denial . Outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told a congressional hearing last week that the new Libyan government had the ""willingness but not the capacity"" to provide security. Bettamer doesn't agree, saying the government is in a state of denial. ""The government is ignoring the problem and not confronting it,"" he says, by blaming everything on Moammar Gadhafi loyalists. He believes it's afraid of confronting extremist groups. Another Libyan source familiar with the situation in Benghazi agreed. ""When every day you have campaign of assassinations and attacks against government, police and security facilities and nobody is arrested, you have a bad situation,"" the source said, adding that a group affiliated with Ansar al Shariah now controls one of the largest Gadhafi-era military camps in the city. Libyan Interior Minister Ashur Shuwail unveiled a plan last week involving the police, army and some militia to secure Benghazi -- one that may involve a nightly curfew from midnight to 5 a.m. But it's not just Benghazi. The UK Foreign Office has advised against travel throughout Libya -- apart for Tripoli and a number of towns on the coast. To the east of Benghazi, several towns are jihadist strongholds. Canada's Foreign Affairs Department warned last week of ""ongoing clashes, including indiscriminate shelling, between pro-government militia and Gadhafi loyalists in Bani Walid,"" as well as clashes between armed groups in Sabha and Kufra in the south. An estimated 400 people have been killed in tribal clashes around Kufra over the past year. The Libyan government is aware of the urgent need to better control its borders, but they are long and desolate -- and much of Libya's air force was destroyed during the revolution. Last week, the Interior Ministry closed the Imsaed border crossing with Egypt to any foreigners, officially to discourage illegal immigration, and began air patrols over the border out of Tobruk. In the south and west, the borders with Niger and Algeria are even more beyond its control, according to regional analysts. The government is beginning to integrate some of the many militia into national security forces. It says 26,000 militia members have applied to join the police. But the process is a slow one only now gathering pace. Five things we learned from the Benghazi hearings . Foreign exodus . The public warnings last week have accelerated the exodus of foreigners from Benghazi. French doctors have quit the city's hospitals. The city's International School is closed. Just last week, the Libya Herald, an independent newspaper, reported on a conference organized by the Benghazi Chamber of Commerce to address the city's huge problems: among them its dilapidated port and collapsing water-treatment system, which pumps raw sewage into the Mediterranean. But participants said there was little foreign presence. In the wake of the terrorist attack in Algeria and the warnings about security in Libya, BP announced at the weekend it was putting its Libyan exploration plans on hold. ""We had expected to restart drilling at the end of the second quarter this year, but we're currently reviewing our plans,"" a BP spokesman said Sunday. BP signed a $900 million agreement with Libya's National Oil Corporation in 2007 but suspended the contract when fighting broke out in February 2011. Crispin Hawes of Eurasia Group says Libyan oil production has made a strong recovery since Gadhafi's overthrow, but security issues, protests and labor disputes are putting further gains at risk. ""The operating security environment continues to deter some service companies from operating in the country at all while others that have returned to Libya are still only slowly ramping up their activities,"" Hawes writes. Libya needs foreign expertise to invest in its dilapidated infrastructure. Former interim Prime Minister Ahmed Jibril told al-Monitor newspaper in October:  ""We have construction projects all over the place, all infrastructure projects -- roads, bridges, power stations, airports. They are all paralyzed."" There are ambitious plans to turn Benghazi into Libya's commercial capital, with its port being upgraded to handle ships carrying 5,000 containers.  But other infrastructure projects are  stymied by a growing number of disputes about land ownership in the wake of the revolution, according to the Libya Herald. Daunting security challenges in North Africa . A little Gadhafi in each of us . Despite the need for qualified attorneys, some of Bettamer's fellow law graduates in Benghazi work as taxi drivers amid widespread unemployment. Even so, the freshly minted graduate is guardedly optimistic about Libya's future despite everything. He believes in greater federalism, saying Libya should comprise seven states, each with its own budget and measures to redistribute from the richer to the poorer. ""After 42 years of Gadhafi, there is a little Gadhafi inside each of us. He took stubbornness from us -- and we saw that when he refused to step down. And we took tyranny from him -- trying to impose our ideas on each other."" But he thinks the ghosts of Libya's past can be exorcised. ""Sometimes I get very nervous about the future of this country. I get depressed. But I still see things that make me optimistic.""

"Egypt's former military chief Abdel Fattah el-Sisi was sworn in Sunday as President, vowing to lead the country through important changes. In its next phase, Egypt ""will witness a total rise on both internal and external fronts, to compensate what we have missed and correct the mistakes of the past,"" he said. Despite the political upheaval Egypt has faced in recent years, el-Sisi celebrated the transition from interim President Adly Mansour. ""In the long history that goes back thousands of years, our homeland did not witness democratic transfer of power. Now, for the first time, the President-elect shakes hands with the outgoing President, and together they sign a power transfer document in an unprecedented occasion,"" he said in an address in front of the Supreme Constitutional Court's General Assembly in Cairo. El-Sisi won 96% of the vote in last month's presidential election for a four-year term. When he was declared the winner last week, a boisterous celebration erupted in Cairo's Tahrir Square, filled with fireworks and balloons bearing his image. Military and security personnel watched from the edges as crowds danced and sang. Washington is looking forward to working with el-Sisi ""to advance our strategic partnership and the many interests shared by the United States and Egypt,"" the White House press secretary said last week. The election was called amid political turbulence that saw Mohamed Morsy -- the country's first democratically elected President after the ouster of longtime leader Hosni Mubarak -- removed from power in a July military coup. El-Sisi, who was army chief at the time, stepped down from his military post this year to run for President. The White House said while it is pleased that international observers were allowed to participate in the election, ""we also share concerns raised by observation groups about the restrictive political environment in which this election took place."" ""As Egypt looks toward parliamentary elections later this year, we urge the government to consider the recommendations of the observer groups on ways to improve the administration of future elections,"" the White House said. El-Sisi's sole opponent, Hamdeen Sabahy, received 3.9% of the vote, the country's election commission said. Sabahy conceded defeat but raised questions about the political process. Allegations were made that Sabahy campaign representatives were attacked and detained, and that el-Sisi's representatives were allowed inside polling stations, Egypt's state-run Ahram Online news agency has reported. ""We cannot give any credibility or ratification to the announced numbers of turnout or results,"" Sabahy said last month.

"A new document by Iran's supreme leader calling for the elimination of Israel shows that world powers must not rush into a deal on the country's nuclear program despite an upcoming deadline, Israel's Prime Minister said Monday. ""There is no moderation in Iran. It is unrepentant, unreformed, it calls for Israel's eradication, it promotes international terrorism,"" Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement. ""This terrorist regime in Iran must not be allowed to become a nuclear threshold power. And I call on the P5+1 countries -- don't rush into a deal that would let Iran rush to the bomb."" (The P5+1 refers to the United States, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany -- the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, plus Germany.) Iran insists it only wants nuclear energy.  And Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, while calling for the elimination of Israel, said he opposes ""a massacre of the Jewish people in this region."" Instead, he seeks a referendum. But in the meantime, ""armed resistance is the cure,"" he says, calling for the West Bank to be ""armed like Gaza."" The call reflects internal Palestinian politics as well. Iran supports Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza. Hamas' rival faction, Fatah, controls the West Bank. On Sunday, the government in the West Bank accused Hamas of bombing its leaders' homes. Israelis were stabbed in two ""terrorist"" incidents Monday, leaving one woman dead, police said. Annihilation call made through Twitter . The Iranian leader made his call for Israel to be ""annihilated"" on Twitter over the weekend. Mixed in with tweets insisting that Iran is committed to diplomacy on other issues, Khamenei posted a series of tweets slamming Israel.  Among them was a document called ""9 key questions about elimination of Israel."" While he and other Iranian leaders have spoken similarly of Israel in the past, the one-page document, packed with specific details, was new. It says the ""proper way of eliminating Israel"" is for ""all the original people of Palestine including Muslims, Christians and Jews wherever they are, whether inside Palestine, in refugee camps in other countries or just anywhere else, take part in a public and organized referendum."" The ""Jewish immigrants who have been persuaded into emigration to Palestine do not have the right to take part,"" he adds. It's unclear who Khamenei thinks the ""original people of Palestine"" are, given that the region's history dates back thousands of years and includes countless waves of immigration and exile. A June poll by the Washington Institute found that most Palestinians in Gaza oppose a two-state solution and want to work toward abolishing Israel -- a goal that is in line with Hamas' charter.  A July poll by the Dialog Institute found that most Israelis support a two-state solution, Haaretz reported. ISIS affects U.S.-Iran relations . U.S. President Barack Obama recently sent a letter to Khamenei about cooperating in the fight against ISIS, the terror group that calls itself the Islamic State.  Revelations about the letter have raised questions over whether Obama's stance on Iran is softening. U.S. officials insist Washington is not coordinating military actions with Tehran. ""There is some deconflicting, in the sense that since they have some troops or militias they control in and around Baghdad,"" Obama told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday. ""We let them know, 'Don't mess with us. We're not here to mess with you.'  We're focused on our common enemy. But there's no coordination or common battle plan. And there will not be."" ""We still have big differences with Iran's behavior vis-a-vis our allies, them poking and prodding at -- and creating unrest and sponsoring terrorism in the region, around the world, their anti-Israeli rhetoric and behavior,"" Obama added.  ""So, that's a whole 'nother set of issues which prevents us from ever being true allies."" Tensions between Obama and Netanyahu are widely reported. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden sought to refute them Monday. ""Like all close friends, we talk honestly with one another. We talk directly with one another. We disagree with one another. We love one another, and we drive one another crazy,"" he said in a speech to the Jewish Federations of North America. ""We will not let Iran acquire a nuclear weapon, period,"" he added. The deadline for the current round of nuclear negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 is November 24. Obama left it unclear Sunday whether a deal will be struck by then. ""The question now is: Are we going to be able to close this final gap, so that they can re-enter the international community, sanctions can be slowly reduced, and we have verifiable, lock-tight assurances that they can't develop a nuclear weapon?  There's still a big gap.  We may not be able to get there.""","Israeli PM Netanyahu says the document shows there is ""no moderation in Iran""

"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Western nations should ""ratchet up the sanctions"" on Iran rather than go through with a proposal for a nuclear agreement that he calls an ""extremely bad deal."" Netanyahu, in an interview with CNN chief political correspondent Candy Crowley that aired Sunday on ""State of the Union,"" said easing sanctions would take off the financial pressure that could one day cause Iran to ""cease and desist"" from its controversial nuclear program. ""Iran is really on the ropes, their economy is ... close to paralysis, and all of a sudden, you take off the pressure, everybody will understand that you're heading south,"" he said. Netanyahu said Iran only gives minor concessions in the proposed deal and will keep the capacity for making nuclear weapons. He said he is hopeful for a far better deal. The way to get that is not to reduce sanctions, he said. ""I think they should not only keep up the pressure, I think you should increase the pressure, because it's finally working,"" he said. ""And if you give it up now, when you have that pressure, and Iran doesn't even take apart, dismantle one centrifuge, what leverage will you have when you ease the pressure?"" The United States and other nations are ""getting close"" to an interim deal with Iran that would prevent its nuclear program ""from advancing, and roll it back"" in key areas, a senior U.S. administration official told CNN on Friday. Netanyahu will meet this week with leaders from France, Russia and the United States to urge them to hold out for a better deal. Netanyahu said U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry will visit Israel on Friday, but the State Department said the trip has yet to be confirmed. Netanyahu met Sunday with French President Francois Hollande and is scheduled to visit Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Wednesday. ""I would like to make it clear that there can be disagreements even among the best of friends, certainly on issues related to our future and our fate,"" Netanyahu said Sunday at the start of Israel's weekly Cabinet meeting. ""I hope that we will succeed in convincing our friends this week and in the days afterwards to achieve a much better agreement."" Russia says now is time to make deal with Iran on nuclear program . ""If you do a bad deal, you may get to the point where your only option is a military option,"" he told Crowley. ""So, a bad deal actually can lead you to exactly the place you don't want to be.  I think if you want a peaceful solution as I do, then the right thing to do is ratchet up the sanctions."" U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, in an exclusive interview with CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr, said Saturday night the United States is ""listening carefully"" to Israel. He reiterated that Washington is continuing its longtime strategy to ensure that Iran cannot gain the capability of building nuclear weapons. He said the U.S. is considering different options to accomplish that goal. But he said it would be irresponsible if the two sides in the negotiations didn't pursue diplomatic engagement while considering Israel's concerns. ""What we have been trying to do, and are doing, is working through these difficult issues,"" he said Saturday at the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, California.  ""We think that there is some possibility (of an agreement) -- although we're very clear-eyed on this. We understand every danger and dimension of what Iran represents to Israel and us, and our other partners in the Middle East."" Hagel said the United States -- and Iran -- understand that there is the possibility of a military strike from a potentially isolated Israel. ""We would never tell Israel, or any country, a sovereign nation, an ally, a very close partner and friend as Israel is, that they can't do something,"" he said. ""They will do whatever they think is necessary to defend their own interest."" During the forum, which brought together defense experts and lawmakers, Hagel said the U.S. won't sign a bad deal. ""This administration is not going to try to force something that doesn't fit to get a deal. We won't do that,"" he said. ""The stakes are too high for our country and for the world."" There was plenty of skepticism at the forum about the proposed agreement with Iran. Much of that skepticism was led by key Democrats, including Hagel's predecessor, Leon Panetta. He was concerned about what will happen with the already enriched nuclear fuel, with thousands of centrifuges, with a heavy water reactor under construction in Arak, Iran. ""And how of all of this going to be inspected and verified?"" Panetta said to CNN. Britain's David Cameron makes 11th hour push for Middle East contracts . Is trust enough when it comes to Iran? The powerful chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee said no. ""I love the slogan 'Trust but verify,' but I've never understood it. Because I think the right slogan is 'Don't trust,'"" Sen. Carl Levin said during the panel discussion. ""I don't trust the Iranians -- and by the way, they don't trust us."" The proposal covers every aspect of Iran's nuclear program, including uranium enrichment, uranium stockpiles and all nuclear facilities including military ones, the senior U.S. administration official told CNN on Friday. The deal will be on the table during the next round of talks in Geneva, Switzerland, that begin Wednesday evening. Iran has always maintained that its nuclear program is purely for peaceful purposes. Even though Iran has denied working toward nuclear weapons, it has said it will not submit to any plan that would totally eliminate its nuclear program. The U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, has found some modest progress. Iran has halted the installation of new advanced centrifuges, which are quicker at generating highly enriched uranium, according to an IAEA report. Iran has support from Russia, whose foreign minister said Saturday on Russian TV that the opportunity to bring about an end to a decade-long standoff must not be passed up. ""Our common impression is that there is a very good chance now which should not be missed,"" Sergey Lavrov said in remarks broadcast on state-run TVC. The United States, along with the four other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany -- known as the P5+1 -- came close to a deal during recent talks with Iran in Geneva, but the discussions ended with each side blaming the other for the lack of an agreement.

"At least eight people came down with listeria -- and one of them died -- after, authorities believe, eating ""Hispanic-style cheese."" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday reported the outbreak, which has affected people only of Hispanic descent and living in California or Maryland. Three babies were among those infected, while the other five were adults, including two women who had recently given birth. The illnesses date back to between August 1 and November 27, 2013. Seven cases -- all in Maryland -- ended up being hospitalized, with the lone death occurring in sole California case, according to the CDC. The age of the person who died was not given. Earlier this month, health inspectors in Virginia found listeria monocytogenes bacteria in a sample of Cuajada en Terron, or fresh cheese curd, on sale in clear, unlabeled plastic bags at a Mega Mart in Manassas. This was traced to Roos Foods, a company based in Kenton, Delaware. Virginia authorities said at that time there were no known sicknesses in the state tied to that cheese. What you need to know about listeria . A few days later, Maryland authorities' tests of pre-packaged cheese products produced by Roos Foods also came back positive for listeria. That state's health and mental hygiene department warned people not to buy or consume any products from that company sold under brand names Santa Rosa de Lima, Amigo, Mexicana, Suyapa, La Chapina and La Purisima Crema Nica. Older adults, pregnant women, newborns and adults with weakened immune systems are most susceptible to listeriosis, according to the CDC. It typically spreads through the consumption of contaminated foods such as uncooked meats and vegetables, unpasteurized milk and cheeses, and cooked and processed foods such as certain soft cheeses, ready-to-eat meats and smoked seafoods. Newborns can develop it if their mothers ate such tainted foods while pregnant. A person with listeriosis usually has fever and muscle aches, sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms, according to the CDC. They might also have headaches, a stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance or convulsions. The public health agency says that about 1,600 people fall ill and 260 die each year in the United States from this ailment. A call placed Friday by CNN to Roos Foods wasn't immediately returned.

"(CNN) -- NASA has put off the planned launch of its next-generation Orion spacecraft for a year, a setback to efforts to fly a successor to its aging space shuttles, the space agency announced Monday. The Orion space vehicle in this artist rendering from Lockheed Martin's web site, won't see space until 2014. ""September 2014 is when we are saying we will launch the first crew on the Orion,"" program manager Jeff Hanley told reporters in a conference call Monday. NASA officials plan to wrap up assembly of the International Space Station and retire the space shuttle fleet in 2010, freeing up money to build and fly the new spacecraft. Cost concerns are at the root of the delay, but NASA is also giving itself wiggle room to deal with the unforeseen technical problems that will inevitably crop up, Hanley said. ""It's the unknown unknowns that we have to hedge against,"" he said. ""Having some number of months of schedule flexibility to meet our commitment, in addition to having some number of months of cost -- dollars -- flexibility, is key to keeping ourselves in a healthy posture."" Sometimes called ""Apollo on steroids,"" Orion is designed to ferry astronauts to and from the space station and eventually back to the moon. Unlike the space shuttles, which land like an airplane, Orion is a capsule that will parachute to a landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California.  See photos of the full-size mock-up » . The new goal of September 2014 is a year later than NASA had planned to launch the first Orion, but still six months short of the March 2015 commitment date set by Congress. Program managers were hoping to fly the new vehicle much sooner than that to keep the gap between the last shuttle flight and the first Orion flight to a minimum. ""As we looked at the plan we had for September 2013 against the available dollars, it became clear to us that we needed to adjust our schedules,"" said Hanley.","Cost concerns are at the root of the delay, says program manager .

"For much of the past decade, Iran's nuclear weapons development program has been one of the top national security concerns for the United States. Even as we fought wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and hunted down al Qaeda's leaders, American intelligence officers, military and top diplomats have been working round the clock to prevent Iran from developing the bomb. An Iran armed with nuclear weapons, capable of threatening Israel and other regional states, would touch off a nuclear arms race in the world's most volatile region. It would be an unmitigated disaster.  We must make all efforts to prevent this. For this reason, I have pressed for ever-tightening sanctions to isolate Iran from the global economy and have supported a policy that leaves all options on the table, including military force. The stakes are simply too high to risk any miscalculation of our resolve by Iran's leaders. In pushing for ever more punitive sanctions, we held out the hope that by increasing the economic pressure enough, we might be able to force Iran to give up its nuclear weapons ambition and rejoin the community of nations.  Now, we are at a moment in the standoff with Tehran that will test that assumption. Opinion: Why Israel, Gulf states are wary of Iran nuclear talks . In repeated statements since his election as Iran's new president in June, President Hassan Rouhani expressed interest in exploring a negotiated end to the sanctions in exchange for walking back its nuclear program and a verifiable inspections to ensure compliance. The just-concluded Geneva meeting, though unsuccessful in achieving a breakthrough on an interim deal, reportedly came close. The Iranians and the P5+1 group will be reconvening there this week for a second round. In the meantime, there have been calls for the Senate to continue work on a new round of sanctions that was passed by the House with my support earlier this year.  Advocates of this approach say that sanctions brought us to this point and passage of a new round of sanctions during the negotiations will improve the likelihood of success at the bargaining table. I disagree. President Barack Obama and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry have asked for more time to test Iran's willingness to enter into a tough and verifiable process of ending its nuclear weapons program, and I think we should give it to them. The sanctions have succeeded in forcing Iran to the table, and a further round right now -- when it has the potential to derail the negotiations -- is unnecessary.  We will know soon enough whether the Iranian regime is serious about a new direction in its nuclear program and its relationship with the West. If it is not, there will be ample opportunity to tighten the stranglehold on Iran's economy, and further sanctions will have my full support. US-Israel rift over Iran nukes now in the open . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has raised the concern that any relaxation of sanctions in an interim deal risks unraveling the whole sanctions regime. This is not an illusory concern, and for this reason, any partial lifting of the freeze on Iranian assets must be quickly reversible if the Iranians balk on a final deal. But the absence of an interim deal is also problematic if it means another six months of Iranian enrichment. The Iranians must be made to understand that if they walk away or cheat, the sanctions will be tightened to the point of strangulation -- and the international community must be prepared to make good on that threat. I have no illusions about the character of the Iranian regime, nor do I trust it.  I do not believe that we can look into Rouhani's eyes and see the truth, let alone his soul. Even if Rouhani was serious about his intentions, there is no guarantee that Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, would bless any agreement with the international community that forces Iran to verifiably foreswear development of the bomb. I share the concerns that have been expressed by others here, in Israel and in the Gulf states. Ultimately, this is not about trust.  It's not about making concessions to Iran or rewarding the mullahs for thwarting the will of the international community for many years. It is about seizing the opportunity to see whether we can end Iran's nuclear weapons program without resorting to military action.  And if we cannot, no doubt will remain that the United States made every effort to resolve this grave threat diplomatically. No negotiation is without risk, and the Iranians' track record is cause for great skepticism. The administration must not accept a bad deal -- and any interim agreement that provides sanctions relief must be easily and quickly reversible.  But neither should the administration be prevented from testing whether it can obtain a good deal that advances our security interests and those of our allies. Yitzhak Rabin, the former Israeli prime minister who signed the Oslo Accords two decades ago, once noted that ""You make peace with your enemies -- not the Queen of Holland."" I agree and urge us to give diplomacy a chance.","Rep. Adam Schiff: Iran's nuclear program has been a top national security concern for 10 years .

"Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a towering figure in postwar British and world politics and the only woman to become British prime minister, has died at the age of 87. She suffered a stroke Monday, her spokeswoman said. A British government source said she died at the Ritz Hotel in London. Thatcher's funeral will be at St. Paul's Cathedral, with full military honors, followed by a private cremation, the British prime minister's office announced. Thatcher served from 1975 to 1990 as leader of the Conservative Party. She was called the ""Iron Lady"" for her personal and political toughness. She retired from public life after a stroke in 2002 and suffered several strokes after that. She made few public appearances in her final months, missing a reception marking her 85th birthday hosted by Prime Minister David Cameron in October 2010. She also skipped the July 2011 unveiling of a statue honoring her old friend Ronald Reagan in London. In December 2012, she was hospitalized after a procedure to remove a growth in her bladder. WORLD REACTION: Tributes paid to 'great leader, great Briton' Thatcher . Thatcher made history . Thatcher won the nation's top job only six years after declaring in a television interview, ""I don't think there will be a woman prime minister in my lifetime."" During her time at the helm of the British government, she emphasized moral absolutism, nationalism, and  the rights of the individual versus those of the state -- famously declaring ""There is no such thing as society"" in 1987. Nicknamed the ""Iron Lady"" by the Soviet press after a 1976 speech declaring that ""the Russians are bent on world dominance,"" Thatcher later enjoyed a close working relationship with U.S. President Reagan, with whom she shared similar conservative views. But the British cold warrior played a key role in ending the conflict by giving her stamp of approval to Soviet Communist reformer Mikhail Gorbachev shortly before he came to power. ""I like Mr. Gorbachev. We can do business together,"" she declared in December 1984, three months before he became Soviet leader. Having been right about Gorbachev, Thatcher came down on the wrong side of history after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, arguing against the reunification of East and West Germany. Allowing the countries created in the aftermath of World War II to merge would be destabilizing to the European status quo, and East Germany was not ready to become part of Western Europe, she insisted in January 1990. ""East Germany has been under Nazism or Communism since 1930. You are not going to go overnight to democratic structures and a freer market economy,"" Thatcher insisted in a key interview, arguing that peace, security and stability ""can only be achieved through our existing alliances negotiating with others internationally."" West German leader Helmut Kohl was furious about the interview, seeing Thatcher as a ""protector of Gobachev,"" according to notes made that day by his close aide Horst Teltschik. The two Germanies reunited by the end of that year. A grocer's daughter . Thatcher -- born in October 1925 in the small eastern England market town of Grantham --  came from a modest background, taking pride in being known as a grocer's daughter. She studied chemistry at Oxford, but was involved in politics from a young age, giving her first political speech at 20, according to her official biography. She was elected leader of the Conservative Party in 1975, when the party was in opposition. She made history four years later, becoming prime minister when the Conservatives won the elections of 1979, the first of three election victories to which she led her party. As British leader, Thatcher took a firm stance with the European Community -- the forerunner of the European Union -- demanding a rebate of money London contributed to Brussels. Her positions on other issues, both domestic and foreign, were just as firm, and in one of her most famous phrases, she declared at a Conservative Party conference that she had no intention of changing her mind. ""To those waiting with bated breath for that favorite media catchphrase, the U-turn, I have only one thing to say: 'You turn if you want to. The lady's not for turning,'"" she declared, to cheers from party members. The United Kingdom fought a short, sharp war against Argentina over the Falklands Islands under Thatcher in 1982, responding with force when Buenos Aires laid claim to the islands. WATCH: Remembering Margaret Thatcher . Announcing that Britain had recaptured South Georgia Island from Argentina, Thatcher appealed to nationalist sentiments, advising the press: ""Just rejoice at the news and congratulate our forces."" A journalist shouted a question at her as she turned to go back into 10 Downing Street: ""Are we going to war with Argentina, Mrs. Thatcher?"" She paused for an instant, then offered a single word: ""Rejoice."" Controversy over Falklands war . The conflict was not without controversy, even in Britain. A British submarine sank Argentina's only cruiser, the General Belgrano, in an encounter that left 358 Argentines dead. The sinking took place outside of Britain's declared exclusion zone. In her first term, Thatcher reduced or eliminated many government subsidies to business, a move that led to a sharp rise in unemployment. By 1986, unemployment had reached 3 million. But Thatcher won landslide re-election in 1983 on the heels of the Falklands victory, her Conservative Party taking a majority of seats in parliament with 42% of the vote. Second-place Labour took nearly 28%, while the alliance that became the Liberal Democrats took just over 25%. A year later, she escaped an IRA terrorist bombing at her hotel at the Conservative Party conference in Brighton. She was re-elected in 1987 with a slightly reduced majority. She was ultimately brought down, not by British voters, but by her own Conservative party. Brought down by the poll tax . She was forced to resign in 1990 during an internal leadership struggle after she introduced a poll tax levied on community residents rather than property. The unpopular tax led to rioting in the streets. She married her husband, Denis Thatcher, a local businessman who ran his family's firm before becoming an executive in the oil industry, in 1951 -- a year after an unsuccessful run for Parliament. The couple had twins, Mark and Carol, in 1953. She was elected to Parliament in 1959 and served in various positions, including education secretary, until her terms as prime minister. Thatcher was awarded the U.S. Medal of Freedom by President George H. W. Bush in 1991, a year after she stepped down as prime minister. She was named Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven after leaving office. She retired from public life after a stroke in 2002 and suffered several smaller strokes after that. Her husband died in June 2003. Though her doctors advised against public speaking, a frail Thatcher attended Reagan's 2004 funeral, saying in a prerecorded video that Reagan was ""a great president, a great American, and a great man."" ""And I have lost a dear friend,"" she said. In the years that followed she encountered additional turmoil. In 2004, her son Mark was arrested in an investigation of an alleged plot by mercenaries to overthrow the president of Equatorial Guinea in west Africa. He pleaded guilty in a South African court in 2005 to unwittingly bankrolling the plot. WATCH: Kissinger: Thatcher's strong convictions .

"(CNN) -- With fish as witnesses, the president of Maldives and his Cabinet wore scuba gear and used hand signals Saturday at an underwater meeting to highlight the threat climate change poses to the archipelago nation. The Maldives declaration will be presented at a U.N. summit on climate change in December. The meeting, chaired by President Mohamed Nasheed, took place around a table about 16 feet (5 meters) underwater, according to the president's Web site. Bubbles ascended from the face masks the president and the Cabinet wore, and fish swam around them. At the meeting, the Cabinet signed a declaration calling for global cuts in carbon emissions that will be presented before a U.N. climate summit in Copenhagen, Denmark, in December. ""We are trying to send our message to let the world know what is happening and what will happen to the Maldives if climate change isn't checked,"" Nasheed said, according to his Web site. Asked what would happen if Copenhagen fails, the president said, ""we are all going to die,"" according to the site. The ministers signed their wet suits, which are being auctioned, to raise money for coral reef protection in the Maldives, the Web site said. Maldives is grappling with the very likely possibility that it will go under water if the current pace of climate change keeps raising sea levels. The Maldives is an archipelago of almost 1,200 coral islands south-southwest of India. Most of it lies just 4.9 feet (1.5 meters) above sea level. The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change has forecast a rise in sea levels of at least 7.1 inches (18 cm) by the end of the century. The country's capital, Male, is protected by sea walls. But creating a similar barrier around the rest of the country will be cost-prohibitive.  Watch how the Maldives are fighting to survive » . Soon after his election in November, Nasheed raised the possibility of finding a new homeland for the country's 396,000 residents. The tourist nation wants to set aside part of its annual billion-dollar revenue into buying a new homeland, he said at the time. ""We will invest in land,"" he said. ""We do not want to end up in refugee tents if the worst happens."" Nasheed's government said it has broached the idea with several countries and found them to be ""receptive."" Lands owned by Sri Lanka and India were possibilities because the countries have similar cultures, cuisine and climate as the Maldives. Australia is also being considered because of the vast unoccupied land it owns. CNN's Saeed Ahmed contributed to this report.","President, Cabinet don scuba gear to sign carbon emissions declaration .

"Last week's massacre at a Colorado movie theater revived the dormant gun control debate in the United States, but neither President Barack Obama nor Republican candidate Mitt Romney is pushing for new laws now to prevent similar attacks. Obama supports reinstating a ban on manufacturing some semi-automatic weapons for civilian use that expired eight years ago, but congressional inaction on the issue has caused the president to instead seek better enforcement of existing laws, his spokesman said Thursday. ""The assault weapons ban is an issue that the president has supported the reinstatement of since its expiration in 2004,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters. ""But given the stalemate in Congress, our focus is on steps that we can take to make sure criminals and others who should not have those guns, make sure that they cannot obtain them."" Colorado hospitals chip in for shooting victims' care . Romney, meanwhile, says no new laws are needed while acknowledging the current ones cannot stop someone intent on doing harm from obtaining guns. ""I don't support new gun laws in our country,"" Romney told CNN's Piers Morgan in an interview Thursday, adding later that ""the effort to continue to look for some law to somehow make violence go away is missing the point."" The real point, he said, is to prevent people who are ""deranged and distressed"" from ""carrying out terrible acts,"" noting that Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh used fertilizer to make the explosives for the attack that killed 168 people in 1995. ""With products that can be purchased legally anywhere in the world, he was able to carry out vast mayhem,"" Romney said. ""Somehow thinking that laws against the instruments of violence will make violence go away, I think, is misguided."" The gun-control issue is one of the most politically divisive in American politics, especially in a presidential election year. For that reason, both campaigns had generally ignored it, despite mass killings in recent years -- a gunman who killed 32 people at Virginia Tech in 2007 and another who killed six people and wounded 13 others, including Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, last year in Arizona. Making peace with a monster . Now the July 20 shooting in Aurora, Colorado, by a lone gunman who killed 12 people and wounded scores of others has brought the debate back to the forefront. Both Obama and Romney immediately condemned the slaughter and expressed sympathy, with Obama traveling to Aurora on Sunday to meet with survivors and families of victims. However, Obama avoided any talk of gun control measures until a speech Wednesday night to the National Urban League in which he expressed support for Second Amendment rights but said more needed to be done to prevent gun violence. ""I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals,"" Obama said. ""That they belong on the battlefield of war, not on the streets of our cities."" His comments followed criticism from New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, liberal filmmaker Michael Moore and others calling for more than commiseration with the survivors. ""Soothing words are nice, but maybe it's time that the two people who want to be president of the United States stand up and tell us what they are going to do about it, because this is obviously a problem across the country,"" said Bloomberg, an independent who supports gun control. Moore -- whose documentary ""Bowling for Columbine"" examined the U.S. gun culture in the wake of the 1999 Colorado massacre in which two high school students killed 12 people -- challenged Obama on what his response would be if his own daughters were victims of such an incident. ""If President Obama is watching right now, and I say this with all due respect: What if it were them?"" Moore told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" earlier this week. ""... Would you stand at the microphone the next day and say I feel your pain and ... the existing laws are enough? Is that really what you'd say, Mr. President? I don't think so."" Some conservatives also called for action, with media mogul Rupert Murdoch tweeting after last week's shootings that ""we have to do something about gun controls"" while Fox host Bill O'Reilly said in a July 23 commentary that Congress should pass laws requiring that sales of heavy weapons be reported to the FBI and imposing mandatory 10-year sentences on any crime committed with a gun. ""That would dent the problem,"" O'Reilly said. ""But the truth is criminals will always get guns. Always."" Official: Trap in Colorado suspect's home had 30 homemade grenades, gasoline . Last year, Obama mentioned gun safety only in passing after the Arizona shootings that injured Giffords. Two months later, the president wrote an opinion piece that acknowledged the importance of the Second Amendment and called for focusing on ""effective steps that will actually keep those irresponsible, law-breaking few from getting their hands on a gun in the first place."" His three-step plan included enforcing existing laws, rewarding states that provide the best data about gun owners, and a better system for background checks. Carney outlined a similar response Thursday, saying background checks have been strengthened and calling for a more comprehensive community effort to reduce gun violence. However, Obama supported a tougher platform when he ran for president in 2008 that included reinstituting the assault weapons ban, stopping destruction of background check documents and closing the federal gun show loophole. Gun safety advocates have expressed disappointment with the president's actions since taking office, particularly over his failure to fight for reinstatement of the assault weapons ban. On Thursday, the Brady Campaign to strengthen gun control called for a national dialogue on solutions to gun violence, such as criminal background checks on all gun purchases. However, the group's president, Dan Gross, stopped short of calling for stronger steps such as reinstating the assault weapons ban or limiting access to high-powered ammunition. ""What we're asking for is the voice of the American public to engage in this issue and to hold our leaders accountable,"" Gross told reporters. Meanwhile, a group of law enforcement officials who have joined up against gun violation called Thursday for expanded background checks on gun sales via the Internet and weapons shows, as well as a ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines. One reason for political inaction is a public preference for gun ownership, as expressed in opinion polls and advocated by the powerful National Rifle Association. A Pew Research Center poll in April found that 55% of highly coveted independents feel it is ""more important to protect gun ownership than to control guns,"" with 40% saying controlling gun ownership is more important. The poll also found that 72% of Republicans feel protecting gun ownership is important, while 27% of Democrats feel that way. Threats before, after other 'Dark Knight' showings, authorities said . The NRA has labeled Obama an enemy of Second Amendment rights, and so far in the 2012 election cycle, Romney has received $126,440 from gun rights groups, compared to Obama's $2,300. That trend is consistent with the 2008 cycle, when Republican nominee John McCain collected $483,711 in such contributions and Obama received $25,987. ""Historically the pro-control side has struggled to come up with a compelling narrative that will help people come over to the case of stricter gun control laws,"" said Kristin A. Goss, an associate professor of public policy and political science at Duke University and author of ""Disarmed: The Missing Movement for Gun Control in America."" ""For a long time these gun violence rates and massacres speak for themselves,"" Goss said. ""They relied on that to make the case but were up against a very powerful but very well-disciplined and skillful army that was good at taking those arguments apart."" Gross of the Brady Campaign -- named after former White House Press Secretary James Brady, who was shot in the head during the 1981 assassination attempt of President Ronald Reagan -- argued Thursday that the NRA's influence is not so pervasive. ""Despite the fact that the NRA spent $6.67 million against him in 2008, Obama beat the NRA like a drum, winning 11 of 13 states where the NRA spend significantly on ads,"" Gross said. ""Obama also won 17 states with significant numbers of gun owners."" He also noted that Romney supported an assault weapons ban when he was Massachusetts governor. Asked about his stance in Massachusetts, Romney told NBC on Wednesday that the legislation he signed banning assault weapons ""was backed both by the Second Amendment advocates, like myself, and those that wanted to restrict gun rights, because it was a compromise."" Referring to suspect James Holmes in the latest Colorado killings, Romney said: ""A lot of what this young man did was clearly against the law. The fact that it was against the law did not prevent it from happening."" Looking into the minds of killers . Gun owners and collectors also reject the contention that tougher controls will solve the problem. ""If everyone legally owned and carried a gun,"" argued collector Brad Whiteford of Virginia Beach, Virginia, ""there would be a lot less crime."" Do you own a gun? Share a photo and tell us why.

"Militants staged a deadly attack on Yemen's Defense Ministry on Thursday, ramming the building with an explosives-laden vehicle, followed by gunmen who battled security forces inside. The attack targeted a hospital at the Defense Ministry complex, Yemen's state-run Saba news agency reported. At least 52 people died in the attack in the capital, Sanaa, according to the government. A Defense Ministry official said four foreign doctors were among the dead. Also, a relative of President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi died in the attack, the government said. It did not name the relative. Earlier, Defense Ministry officials had said 10 soldiers and nine militants were among the dead. Gunmen shoot down Russian military contractors in Yemen . It took several hours for security forces to regain control of the building after the 9 a.m. attack. No group immediately claimed responsibility. The U.S. State Department condemned the attack. Yemen is home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, believed by many analysts to be the most dangerous affiliate of the terror network.

"Flanked by Jewish politicians in front of the United Nations on a July day, then-Sen. Hillary Clinton made a forceful appeal for the United States to back Israel as the Jewish nation's forces squared off against Hezbollah during the 2006 Lebanon War. ""We will stand with Israel because Israel is standing for American values as well as Israeli ones,"" said Clinton. Clinton was an outspoken defender of Israel and representative for American Jews for eight years in the Senate. But it wasn't always that way. She had to work hard for Jewish support in 2000 as the New York Jewish community was skeptical of her support for Israel and publicly wondered whether the former first lady was too sympathetic with the Palestinians. But by the time she ran for president in 2008, a number of Jewish Democrats said her record with the community was unprecedented. Touting her foreign policy credentials and defense of Israel, Jewish leaders flocked to Clinton as she ran against Barack Obama in the Democratic primaries. But after losing to Obama, Clinton signed on to be the new President's secretary of state and the face of his foreign policy. Over the next four years, some Jewish leaders said Clinton's once-consistent, outspoken leadership on Israel was hamstrung by her role as Obama's top diplomat. Obama and Abbas: Time running out for even a framework for Middle East talks . Many applauded when she talked tough on Iran, like in 2010 when she labeled the country as one with an ""anti-Semitic president and hostile nuclear ambitions"" or when she said in Qatar that ""Iran is moving toward a military dictatorship."" But many also winced quietly when she floated trial balloons about a nuclear deal with Iran, like in a 2010 interview with the BBC in which Clinton said Iran could enrich uranium for civilian purposes if it came into compliance with international norms. As Clinton mulls another run for the presidency in 2016, there are questions in the Jewish community about whether her time at State has shifted her standing on issues important to American Jews. To some, the foreign policy experience she developed will just further endear her to a bloc of voters one leader described as ""extraordinarily cosmopolitan on foreign affairs."" But to others, including a number of Democrats, Clinton's ties to the Obama administration -- a presidency that some Jewish leaders say is not strong enough on Israel and too focused on working out a nuclear deal with Iran -- has not helped her standing with American Jews. ""On the amorphous level, that she was part of the administration, there may be some residual weakening,"" said one Jewish leader in Washington who asked for anonymity to speak more candidly. Other Jewish leaders see it as a mixed bag that Clinton will have to define before she decides about her political future. ""At a minimum, her four years in the secretary's office did not hurt her in the community, even as the President got beat up in some corners of the community,"" said another Jewish leader with ties to Clinton. ""I don't know it especially helped her among Jews, but it didn't hurt her."" Tapping into the Clinton mystique . Jewish leaders questioning Clinton's standing is particularly interesting when the Clinton family's longstanding ties with the community is considered. Those ties are so great that Bill Clinton -- a Southern Baptist born in Arkansas -- is jokingly considered and honorary Jew to some leaders. ""Her husband was like the first Jewish president,"" joked one Jewish Democrat. Others said the Clintons' understanding of the community was better than any other American politicians. Clinton is also helped by history. Despite the fact that conservatives have long hypothesized that Americans Jews would begin to vote more Republican because of party's positions on taxes and Israel, the past two decades have shown the opposite. According to a 2012 report by The Solomon Project, a nonpartisan public policy organization, Jewish support for Democrats has grown since the 1990s. When Republican Ronald Reagan won the presidency in 1980 and 1984, he garnered between 31% and 37% of the Jewish votes. But starting in 1992, when Bill Clinton was first elected to the White House, American Jews began to gravitate to the Democratic Party. In fact, at no point between 1990 to 2008 has a Democratic candidate for the presidency won less than 70% of the Jewish vote. In 2008, Obama won nearly three-quarters of the Jewish vote. But history is also changing. In 2012, Obama became the first Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter in 1976 to win less than 70% of the Jewish vote when 69% of the community supported the president. ""The majority of American Jews are liberal Democrats,"" said Nathan Diament, executive director of the Orthodox Union Advocacy Center. ""But in the Orthodox segment of the community, President Obama is less popular. I think it remains to be seen whether, for the Orthodox community, that translates into some baggage for Hillary Clinton."" Since leaving the State Department, Clinton has appeared at a number of fundraiser for Jewish groups where she has been well-received. In October 2013, Clinton was the keynote speaker at the $5,000-a-plate Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago Vanguard fundraising luncheon. In January 2014, Clinton was one of a few speakers at the memorial service for Samuel Bronfman, a longtime Clinton supporter and stalwart in the Jewish community. A Jewish leader in New York who attended the event told CNN that speaking at the memorial was a ""huge coup"" for Clinton because ""everyone who is anyone in the Jewish community will be there."" Clinton documents show 'West Wing' mindset . Some explaining to do on Iran . Clinton will have a chance to tout her bona fides with Jewish-Americans on Wednesday when she is honored by Jack Rosen, the head of American Jewish Congress, at an event in New York City. According to Rosen, a Jewish leader with extensive ties to the Clintons, the event is an opportunity for Clinton to talk about issues that are important to the Jewish American community. Rosen specifically pointed out that ""the community"" would like to know where Clinton stands on the deal the U.S. and five other Western nations struck with Iran over its nuclear program. ""We now have this deal with Iran brewing,"" Rosen said. ""The community would like to know where she would come out on these Iranian discussion taking place. How does she see the future outcome out if?"" While the agreement struck in November was preliminary, it dials back Iran's ability to work toward a nuclear weapon and at the same time loosens the chokehold of international sanctions on Iran's economy. Some American Jews have been critical of the deal, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has labeled the deal a ""historic mistake"" that ""has made the world a much more dangerous place."" Rosen was quick to correctly point out that Clinton wasn't in office when the deal with Iran was struck. This distance, he said, gave the former secretary of state a ""sort of the restart button here on Iranian policy because Iranian policy has changed."" But the former first lady has already publicly helped Obama by rebuffing congressional attempts to impose more sanctions on Iran as negotiations play out. In a letter to Senate Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin in February, Clinton wrote that while she was ""a long-time advocate for crippling sanctions against Iran,"" now was the time to ""do everything we can to test whether they can advance a permanent solution."" For some American Jewish leaders, that letter was a troubling sign. ""Having thrown her support to the President's approach on the Iran issue, she is now really tied herself to his policy,"" Diament said. ""If somehow that policy does not succeed, that is something she is going to have a lot of explaining to do."" Rosen came close to echoing Diament's sentiment. ""She wasn't part of (the Iran deal),"" Rosen said, but ""does she support it?"" The answer to that question ""will bring up some questions of her views in comparison to the administration's.""","Some in U.S. Jewish community associate Hillary Clinton with Obama's Israel policy .

"(CNN) -- Mexican authorities issued a hurricane warning along parts of the country's eastern coast Wednesday as Tropical Storm Arlene approached, the National Hurricane Center reported. The storm's speed has slowed, but forecasters said it was expected to start speeding up as it moved west Wednesday night. Arlene, the first named storm of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season, was moving at about 4 mph, packing sustained winds of 60 mph. Authorities in the Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, San Luis Potosi and Nuevo Leon braced for heavy rains. Forecasters from the National Hurricane Center warned of possible flash floods and mudslides. ""With any storm of this size, it's easy to overlook it and call it insignificant,"" said CNN meteorologist Chad Meyers. ""The major effect with this storm will not be wind damage, but will be inland flooding from up to 12 inches of rain in the mountains of Mexico."" The hurricane warning in Mexico stretches from the eastern coastal town of Barra de Nautla north to La Cruz. Authorities have also issued a tropical storm warning from La Cruz north to La Pesca, and from Palma Sola south to Veracruz. Meyers added that while Mexico's major northeastern city of Monterrey should be just north of the maximum rainfall, Victoria ""may be right in the middle of the bull's-eye."" Arlene is expected to make landfall early Thursday very near hurricane strength. It is expected to produce 4 to 8 inches of rain in some areas, while higher amounts of isolated rainfall will likely fall in mountainous terrain and could cause life-threatening flash floods and mud slides. Tropical storm force winds are expected to reach the east coast of Mexico on Wednesday evening, which could make outside preparations difficult or dangerous, the Hurricane Center said. When Arlene makes landfall, the storm surge could raise water levels up to 2 feet above normal tide markers. The Atlantic hurricane season spans June 1 to November 30. CNN's Chad Meyers, Mari Ramos and Sarah Dillingham contributed to this report.","NEW: Mexican authorities issue a hurricane warning with Arlene off eastern coast .

"In what it called the ""largest amount of financial relief ever obtained for deceptive charitable fundraising,"" the New York State Attorney General's office has reached a nearly $25 million settlement with one of the nation's biggest direct-mail companies. The settlement calls for damages of just under $10 million and forgiveness of debt for another $13.8 million against Quadriga Art, whose clients include some of the nation's most well-known charities. A three-year CNN investigation into Quadriga Art and its profiteering off donations made to U.S. veterans has led to a fine that New York regulators say is precedent-setting. This potentially could change how professional fundraisers operate in the state of New York and possibly the entire country. The total settlement prevents Quadriga from engaging in what it calls a ""funded model"" of beginning new charities -- paying all of the start-up costs and fundraising costs in advance in hopes of profit down the road. In particular, the settlement zeroes in on Quadriga's relationship with a charity based in Washington called the Disabled Veterans National Foundation, founded in 2007. After direct-mail payments, little left for veterans . CNN has been reporting on Quadriga and the veterans foundation since the fall of 2010, broadcasting a series of reports that showed the charity sending practically all of the millions it raised back to Quadriga as payment for the direct-mail campaign. Almost none of the cash left over went to veterans, the CNN investigation found. As a result of CNN's reporting, the Senate Finance Committee began an investigation of Quadriga and the veterans foundation.  So did the New York State Attorney General's office. The Senate investigation is ongoing, according to a spokesman for the committee. The New York state investigation found that for all intents and purposes, the charity was a front for Quadriga. ""From the very beginning,"" the state said, ""the investigation found DVNF lacked independence from its principal fundraiser, Quadriga.  Quadriga's lawyer's got the charity up and running and drafted the fundraising counsel agreement that DVNF signed."" In all, the charity raised $116 million since 2008 but returned $104 million of it to Quadriga, according to the attorney general. And of that leftover funds, much of it was sent in the form of donations that one prosecutor said was ""dreck"" -- M&M candy, chef's hats and coats and leftover shoes that no one wanted. The settlement was signed by New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. State Attorney: Actions were 'pretty despicable' ""To take the money that people are trying to spend to help disabled veterans just to feed your own overhead and to pay off your executives as Quadriga did here is pretty despicable,"" Schneiderman told CNN. Quadriga president and CEO Mark Schulhof said in a statement that he has ""taken responsibility for the mistakes that were made"" in its dealings with the veterans charity. ""We deeply apologize for our actions and for any adverse impact they may have had on our industry,"" he said. Schulhof also said his uncle, Tommy Schulhof, had resigned as the company's chairman of the board. Under terms of the settlement, the founding board members of the charity are resigning and the charity can no longer do business with Quadriga for three years unless the company is a legitimate low bidder and prosecutors agree. A spokesman for the Disabled Veterans National Foundation, Timothy Gillis,  said the settlement ""actually strengthens"" the charity. It wasn't just veterans; it was also Native American children .","New York state reaches a nearly $25 million settlement with Quadriga Art .

"For the next three weeks at least, flying to and within China is going to be a stressful affair, for even the hardiest of travelers. Hundreds of flights were canceled or delayed Monday and China's civil aviation regulator warned that more flights in 12 airports will be affected over the coming three weeks. The worst affected airports so far have been Shanghai's two airports -- Pudong and Hongqiao -- two of the country's busiest airline hubs. Another 120 flights were delayed for more than two hours. Domestic travelers have been switching to high-speed trains (Chinese only) after hearing of the widespread delays, leading to severe overcrowding on main rail routes some have likened to the Chinese New Year migration. Officials and airlines have shed little light on the reasons for the disruptions but local media have suggested the cause is due to military exercises. Speculation is rife on social media. ""Perhaps I'm ill-informed but I've never heard of any other countries' military exercises affecting civil airlines on such a large scale,"" posted user @luoyu on Weibo, China's version of Twitter. ""I've also never seen such vast adjustments affecting a quarter of civil airlines' flights in China's history. Whatever is causing the wide-scale delays, it's making history."" What's going on? Local officials cited ""air traffic restrictions"" while Shanghai-based China Eastern Airlines said ""the airspace was occupied,"" according to the Shanghai Daily newspaper. ""Among situations for air traffic restrictions being imposed are when military maneuvers are taking place,"" the newspaper added. CCTV, the state television channel, shared on its Weibo account -- China's equivalent of Twitter -- a widely circulated memo, originally published on a Chinese flight crew blog, that said the civil aviation authority has requested airlines to reduce flights by 25% in eastern China. Hundreds of flights to and from eastern China were canceled or delayed Monday, with 200 flights canceled at Pudong and Hongqiao.  Flights departing from other eastern Chinese cities' airports, including Nanjing and Hangzhou, were also affected. MORE: And the world's best airline 2014 is... Where to expect delays . ""The following 12 airports will experience massive delays for 26 days! Fliers, bring snacks and water!"" the CCTV post said. ""From July 20 to August 15, operations of these airports -- including Shanghai Hongqiao, Shanghai Pudong, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Hefei, Jinan, Wuxi, Ningbo, Qingdao, Lianyungang, Zhengzhou and Wuhan -- will be affected by high-frequency exercises conducted by another party. All airlines are requested to reduce flights by 25% and fliers are expected to face delays."" Officials at the Civil Aviation Administration of China declined to comment when approached by CNN. Past delays . This is the second large-scale air traffic disruption in China in the last two weeks. More than 100 flights were canceled or delayed on July 14 in Shanghai. In December 2006, Shanghai Pudong International Airport closed and hundreds of flights were canceled or delayed due to military exercises. Two Internet users have been held by police for allegedly fabricating and circulating ""anti-corruption-related"" claims, according to Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post. The Internet users claimed the disruption was due to the arrest of a high-ranking government official trying to flee the country. Another 37 people were reprimanded in the crackdown against Internet ""rumor mongers,"" according to SCMP. China's air traffic woes continue . Lengthy flight delays are common in China. The country's largest airports, serving the mega-cities of Shanghai and Beijing, suffer some of the worst flight delays in the world. In June 2013, Beijing's Capital International Airport hit the bottom of a list of the world's most delayed airports, according to U.S.-based air travel information service FlightStats. Just 18.3% of flights from the airport left on time during that month and around 42% of flights suffered delays of 45 minutes or longer. Second worst on the list was Shanghai's Hongqiao, where just 24% of flights departed on time. Overly cautious air traffic control and airspace restrictions for civilian aircraft are two of the reasons for these delays, but flights are also affected by thick smog and once, an unidentified flying object (UFO).

"The recent Ebola outbreak is becoming an issue in the competitive midterm elections. Top Democratic and Republican campaign officials in Washington are uncertain about the political ramifications of Ebola's arrival in the U.S. and are grappling with how to respond. But Republicans are seizing on the issue as an opportunity to again make the case that President Barack Obama isn't leading effectively. They're highlighting Obama's recent assurance that Ebola was ""unlikely"" to get to the U.S. and calling for the U.S. to impose new travel restrictions for those countries in Africa where the outbreak began. It's all part of an effort to force their Democratic opponents to defend Obama's response to Ebola. GOP officials have reason to believe their line of attack will resonate with voters.  CNN has learned from sources at the NRSC, the national campaign organization for Senate Republicans, that the group's internal polling finds 60 percent of voters believe that if a single case of Ebola arises in the U.S., it should be treated as a major crisis by the federal government. ""Washington is broken,"" claimed an NRSC email.  ""The top-down approach championed by Democrats for decades (and controlled by them at the federal level in Washington) has shown itself to be completely unprepared and ill-equipped for 21st Century challenges."" Democrats have been supportive of the administration's efforts, but are pushing for a coordinated effort with other countries to prevent further spread of Ebola. Still, GOP candidates have picked up on the message. Michigan Republican Senate candidate Terri Lynn Land Friday called for a travel ban or other restrictions to ensure more infected people do not enter the country. ""I'm a mom.  I have kids.  People are concerned.  Again, this is a safety and security issue,"" Land told Michigan Public Radio.  She called on the president and her opponent, Democratic Rep. Gary Peters, who she is trailing in most polls, to outline a federal response. ""The President needs to lead,"" Land said.  ""Congressman Peters needs to lead -- to come up with a plan to make sure we can deal with this."" A spokeswoman for Peters told CNN that Land is ""desperate."" ""It is sad Terri Lynn Land is now so desperate that she's trying to use a deadly virus as a political issue, and it's shameful,"" spokeswoman Haley Morris said. ""Before playing politics with such a serious issue, Terri Lynn Land should explain why she pushed for the government shutdown last year, which hampered the CDC and our nation's emergency readiness."" In North Carolina, Thom Tillis, who is trying to unseat Democrat Kay Hagan in one of the most closely watched Senate races this year, also called for a travel ban from West African countries. ""It's time for Washington to take action to protect the American people,"" said Tillis, who many recent polls show is narrowly trailing Hagan. A Hagan spokeswoman responded that Tillis's approach would not do enough. ""Kay believes the U.S. should work together with the international community to take a wide range of steps to fight this epidemic and prevent it from spreading,"" Sadie Weiner said in an email.  ""Travel restrictions may be one tool we can use, but they should be part of a broader strategy because simply sealing the borders to these countries won't make the crisis go away."" As far back as August, Arkansas Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor tried to use the issue of Ebola against his opponent, GOP Rep. Tom Cotton.  In a campaign ad, Pryor accused Cotton of voting against a 2013 bill that included money to respond to pandemics.  But Cotton did support the final version that became law, according to an analysis by Politifact. On Friday, Cotton signed a letter to Obama with fellow House Republicans from Arkansas urging him to consider a ban on flights to affected countries. ""The quality of our hospitals, we well as our talented doctors, is undoubtedly a draw for people with the means and will to come to the U.S. -- sometimes because exposure to Ebola in their own country and in spite of the risk to the health of Americans,"" the GOP congressmen wrote. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Friday that at this point, the Administration is not considering imposing any travel ban. In an interview on CNN Friday, the number two official with the Senate GOP campaign arm, Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, said the U.S. needs to be ""more aggressive"" in screening people coming to the country and pointed to recent report that said the Department of Homeland Security is not equipped right now to deal with a pandemic. ""I don't think we're prepared as we should be,"" Portman said.  ""I think this is another example where the administration was not as engaged early on as they should have been and now we're playing catch-up."" Aides for both the House GOP and Democratic campaign committees tell CNN Ebola has not cropped up in House races at this point.  But that could change as political campaigns in recent weeks have been quick to focus their messages on issues that are on voters' minds. Soon after questions were raised about Obama's response to the terror group ISIS, and public opinion polls showed Americans were increasingly worried about an attack at home, Republican candidates began bringing up the issue. The National Republicans Congressional Campaign Committee rolled out television commercials suggesting several Democratic candidates didn't support funding to respond to terrorists threats and they were ""dangerous."" And though Congress is in recess for the final stretch before the midterm elections, a House committee announced on Friday that it will hold a hearing on the Ebola outbreak on Oct. 16.","Republicans are seizing on the Ebola issue to make a case against Democrats .

"(CNN) -- A group of protesters traveled Thursday to a small Arkansas town, where they held a demonstration to call for the resignation of a school board member who posted anti-gay comments on a social networking site. Holding signs that read, ""All kids matter,"" and ""Resign,"" the small group held the protest in Pleasant Plains, Arkansas, according to CNN affiliate KARK. The town is served by the Midland School District. Clint McCance, vice-president of the district, wrote on his personal Facebook page that he wanted gay people to commit suicide, according to The Advocate, a newspaper focusing on gay news. McCance used the terms ""queer"" and ""fag"" repeatedly, promised to disown his own children if they are gay and stated that he enjoys ""the fact that [gay people] give each other AIDS and die."" Thursday's protesters traveled from Little Rock, about 80 miles southwest of Pleasant Plains. Several wore purple shirts to honor gay youths who committed suicide after being bullied because of their homosexuality, according to pictures provided by KARK. Others held signs containing some of the teens' names and ages. McCance's comments have drawn criticism from education officials in his district and at the state level. ""I strongly condemn the statements that appeared on Mr. Clint McCance's Facebook page,"" Tom Kimbrell, Arkansas commissioner of education, said in a statement Wednesday. ""... The statements attributed to Mr. McCance constitute a significant departure from statements we expect from our school leaders. The divisiveness and disruption of these comments cause me to seriously question the ability of Mr. McCance to remain as an effective member of the Midland School Board."" Because McCance's Facebook page is not accessible publicly, the Advocate said it learned about the posts after being provided with a screen shot. ""I don't know why he said it,"" McCance's father, Ron, told CNN's ""AC360"" on Wednesday. ""All this caught everyone by surprise. He said it was his page, he pulled it and he got caught up in the moment. This was out of character."" Ron McCance said, ""I do defend his right to say what he wants to, but we've all been blindsided."" Attempts by CNN to contact Clint McCance by telephone Thursday were unsuccessful. CNN affiliate KATV also said he was unreachable by telephone, and both KATV and affiliate KARK said no one answered the door at his home. The Midland School District also denounced the posting. ""The district strives to foster an environment that discourages all forms of bullying,"" it said in a statement, ""and an environment that encourages a safe and productive educational climate [for] all of our students. The district is very diligent in pursuing and addressing bullying of any variety on our campuses."" The state Department of Education said earlier it was ""dismayed to see that a school board official would post something of this insensitive nature on a public forum like Facebook."" Because McCance is an elected official, the department cannot deal with him directly, according to the statement.  But staff will be monitoring schools to provide a quick response in case students are bullied because of McCance's comments, it said. Kimbrell said in his statement he had contacted the district superintendent and the president of the school board. ""They are aware of my strong feelings concerning this matter and I know they share in my grave concern,"" he said. ""Along with the members of my staff, I will continue to closely monitor this situation."" The posts were made, according to The Advocate, in response to a bullying awareness campaign sponsored by GLAAD, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. The ""Spirit Day"" campaign aimed to foster recognition of bullying directed at gays and the effects it can have on young people through a series of events held on October 20. One aspect of the campaign encouraged people to wear purple to honor those who had committed suicide after experiencing anti-gay bullying, and to show solidarity with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered youth who face the same pressures. According to the screen grab obtained by The Advocate, McCance wrote the following about the event: ""Seriously they want me to wear purple because five queers committed suicide. The only way im wearin it for them is if they all commit suicide. I cant believe the people of this world have gotten this stupid. We are honoring the fact that they sinned and killed therselves because of their sin."" (sic) There is now a page on Facebook encouraging the Midland School District to fire McCance. More than 45,000 people had ""liked"" the page as of Thursday morning. However, not everyone disagreed with McCance's comments, which he defended on his page by citing his religious beliefs. Gays and lesbians are ""thinking they're all right, and [God is] going to let them think that and go to hell for believing what they're doing is right,"" pastor Harry Craig, of Pleasant Plains Full Gospel Church, told KARK. Kimbrell said his in statement, ""Despite these unfortunate events, it is my utmost hope that the students in the Midland School District and across the state of Arkansas clearly understand that they are all valued and have intellectual and human worth, and they deserve the best education we can offer."" On Tuesday, the federal government warned that bullying and harassment in schools often includes violations of federally protected civil rights. Officials warned that school administrators who fail to properly deal with harassment risk being cited for civil rights violations. In extreme cases, such violations could lead to cuts in federal funding. An 18-year-old Rutgers University student, Tyler Clementi, committed suicide in September, after a secretly taped sexual encounter between him and another man was posted on the Internet.  It was the most recent in a string of suicides by gay youths that have received increased media scrutiny in the context of an anti-bullying push by advocacy groups.

"University of Delaware students are being offered counseling after a doctoral student allegedly hid video cameras in restrooms around the university's Newark campus over a two-year period. Police were alerted after a hidden camera was discovered in a women's restroom on June 27, the university said. An investigation led to the arrest of 38-year-old Javier Mendiola-Soto, a doctoral student from Mexico. Mendiola-Soto has been charged with 21 counts of violation of privacy. His visa has been revoked, and he is in custody. Police searching Mendiola-Soto's home found approximately 1,500 computer video files. ""The analysis concluded that the suspect hid video cameras in other restrooms both on and off campus over a more than two-year period from 2012 until his arrest this month,"" the university said in a statement. ""The scope of the recordings continues to be a focus of the investigation, and the police are attempting conclusively to identify all potential recorded locations."" Recordings have been traced to two restrooms at the Delaware Biotechnology Institute -- where Mendiola-Soto worked -- a unisex bathroom in the building housing the education department, and women's restrooms in a library, memorial hall and laboratory, the university said. The investigation has so far identified approximately 40 potential victims. Police are contacting victims, and the university is offering counseling  to anyone who requests it in connection with the case. ""It is extremely disturbing that this crime was perpetrated against our community invading the privacy of so many women on and around this campus,"" university President Patrick Harker said. ""We have implemented several actions already, including security sweeps of all restrooms and changing rooms on all campuses, randomly timed examinations of all restrooms by custodial staff and increased police patrols throughout buildings,"" he said. The university's head of campus and public safety, Skip Homiak, said new technology had increased the risk of such crimes. ""Invasions of privacy crimes are becoming an increasing concern on college campuses and in public areas given the ready access to small and sophisticated spying devices,"" he said. The university said the investigation was being conducted ""under strict guidelines and protocols designed to protect the privacy of any individual whose image may have been captured on video."" The video evidence is being securely stored and will be destroyed after criminal proceedings end, it said. Police say they don't think the images have been uploaded to the Internet or shared. People who think they may have been recorded should contact the University Police Department hotline at 302-831-4800.","A University of Delaware student allegedly hid cameras in restrooms around campus .

"The coroner who conducted the inquest into the death of Amy Winehouse has resigned, raising the possibility that the case could be reopened. Assistant Deputy Coroner Suzanne Greenaway ruled in October that Winehouse, who was found dead on July 23rd, died of accidental alcohol poisoning. Greenaway resigned in November after officials discovered that she had not been a registered lawyer in the United Kingdom for the required five years. Her resignation was not made public until today. Adding to the intrigue is the fact that Greenaway was appointed to her post by her husband, Andrew Reid, who serves as a London coroner himself. In a statement, Reid said that he was under the impression that his wife's tenure as a registered lawyer in her native Australia qualified her for the post. The Camden Council, the local authority in the matter, said it believed Reid ""had made an error in good faith."" Reid indicated he would be willing to perform any of Greenaway's inquests again if the families of the deceased requested it. Winehouse's family said they are consulting with attorneys and have not yet decided whether to pursue a new inquest.

"Washington (CNN)Republicans poised to take control of Congress are already threatening to kill what could turn out to be President Barack Obama's most significant second-term achievement: a nuclear deal with Iran. U.S. and Iranian negotiators are quickly approaching a November 24 deadline to reach an agreement that would freeze Iran's nuclear program in return for lifting international sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Hopes for a deal have been rising, though Obama cautioned this weekend a ""big gap"" remains between the two sides and there are powerful constituencies in each country angling against an agreement. In the United States, Republicans -- long skeptical of the talks -- are increasingly furious that Obama might sideline Congress to finalize an accord. They're especially angry that the administration might make such a move after last week's midterm elections gave the GOP -- dominated by foreign policy hard-liners -- firm control of the House and Senate. ""Like North Korea in the 1990s, Iran will use a weak deal as cover to get nuclear weapons,"" said Illinois Republican Sen. Mark Kirk, a prominent skeptic of the negotiations. Given the opposition, the Obama administration is believed to favor a framework agreement that, at least initially, would not require Congress to lift sanctions. Instead, the President would temporarily ""suspend"" them. The personal stakes for Obama are immense as he seeks to restore his footing following last week's election drubbing. A deal would elevate his legacy, which lacks a defining foreign policy triumph, and validate his vow to talk to leaders of U.S. enemies first made in a CNN campaign debate seven years ago. It would also mark a stunning diplomatic breakthrough after 35 years of estrangement between Washington and Tehran and represent a major advance on one of the world's thorniest non-proliferation problems. Some of the president's critics doubtless sense a chance to deny Obama a diplomatic win. What to expect from the lame duck Congress . But others, including some Democrats, worry that Obama is being hoodwinked by Iran. They fear the mullahs will pocket sanctions relief and then cheat their way to a nuclear bomb. Republicans could respond to what they see as a ""bad"" deal by seeking to impose new sanctions or drawing up punitive oversight benchmarks for Iranian compliance. That could so sour already tenuous confidence between Washington and Tehran that the deal could crumble. South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham said this weekend that he would back a ""good"" Iran deal but would ""kill"" any agreement that he found problematic. On Thursday, Graham will try to bring up a bill in the Senate that would require Obama to submit any agreement to Congress within three days for review. If he refuses, or if lawmakers vote to show their disapproval of the deal, funding for its implementation would be cutoff. And Kirk has already pledged to mobilize the new Senate behind legislation he wrote with Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez which would target Iran's oil industry with sanctions and provide a ""diplomatic insurance policy"" he says would result in a ""strong deal"" to reverse Tehran's nuclear program. Some Obama opponents on Capitol Hill reject the idea they are opposed to any deal and say an agreement is possible that would address their concerns. But they complain the White House has not worked with lawmakers to arrive at the best combination of carrots and sticks in the talks. They contend that a bad deal is now more likely because the administration has been too eager to make concessions to Iran. The White House declined to discuss its tactics. But the administration has long warned that new sanctions would upend its diplomacy and it denies accusations that Obama plans to go around Congress. Russia steps up nuclear plans in Iran as talks near deadline . Obama would be sure veto any legislation that could threaten the agreement. But Republicans could draw on skeptical Democrats to get closer to a veto proof majority of 67 Senate votes. An official with a prominent pro-Israel policy group in Washington added: ""It is not a question of doing the math. The precise change is in the leader's office. That now enables sanctions legislation to move forward."" But other sources doubt that if it really came to it, there would be enough Democrats to challenge the president's veto and risk being accused of trashing a deal the rest of the world has embraced. But they admit the numbers are tightening. Jim Walsh, a research associate at MIT and an expert on Iranian nuclear diplomacy, predicted a fierce political battle. ""There will definitely be a fight. It will be a hard fight, but I think it will be a fight that the president can win because the consequences of failure are high,"" he said. The White House has already won one skirmish over Iran. Last year, critics sought to derail an interim nuclear deal, but failed largely because Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid blocked sanctions bills. Obama will not have that safety net in the new Republican Senate that convenes in January, and backers of an agreement fear even the threat of tougher action. Dylan Williams, director of government affairs for J Street, a left-leaning pro-Israel group said new sanctions would ""guarantee"" a fracturing of the international coalition against Iran. Even if opponents fail to overcome a veto, Congress could still stir up the kind of trouble that could embolden hardline opponents of President Hassan Rouhani who argue Washington can never be trusted to stick to its commitments. And a deal could not survive as ""temporary"" forever -- eventually Congress would have to act. ""It is clear there is a significant problem,"" said Trita Parsi, founder of the National Iranian American Council, which advocates dialogue between Washington and Tehran. ""At the end of the day, the president needs to lift sanctions through Congress in order to make a deal possible."" The politics on Iran are getting trickier for Obama by the day. Republicans are outraged at reports last week that he wrote to Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, days before the Ayatollah issued a barrage of tweets slamming the ""barbaric, wolflike and infanticidal regime"" in Israel. Meanwhile, a report by the UN's nuclear watchdog body last week suggested Tehran may have violated an interim nuclear deal by feeding natural uranium gas into one of its centrifuges. Iran was also accused of blocking existing inspections to its nuclear plants. The White House has already shown it is ready to play political hardball over Iran, warning last year that anyone who opposes the deal is effectively backing a march to war with Iran. Obama is also at odds over Iran with Israeli Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who views the prospect of an Iranian bomb as an existential threat to the Jewish state. Netanyahu warned in a video address to Jewish Federations leaders on Tuesday that it was obvious Iran wanted to remove sanctions and it should be ""equally obvious"" that it is not prepared to dismantle its nuclear program in return. The White House argues Israel's demand for a complete dismantling of Iran's nuclear infrastructure is impractical. Instead, it wants the deal between the permanent five members of the UN Security Council, Germany and Iran to lengthen the period of time it would take Tehran to dash towards a bomb. ""We will not let Iran get a nuclear weapon. Period. We mean it,"" Vice President Joe Biden said in Washington Monday as negotiators from Iran, the US and Europe toiled in Oman to bridge gaps on a deal ahead of a final round of talks in Vienna next week. In the event they're successful, the pressure on key lawmakers from the White House and pro-Israel lobby groups will be intense. Incoming Republican Senate Foreign Relations committee chairman Bob Corker will be a vital player, as he has voiced skepticism of the president's Iran diplomacy in the past, while being more pragmatic than other Obama critics on sanctions. Another key player is Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is staunchly pro-Israel but could give fellow Democrats cover to stick with their president by backing a deal. And Hillary Clinton will increasingly be looked to by Democrats for guidance in the event of a deal. The former secretary of state and potential 2016 contender has backed Obama's diplomacy but expressed skepticism Iran would sign on to a verifiable deal to halt its nuclear program.Â .","GOP senator to bring up bill that would require Obama to submit Iran deal for approval .

"From the Vatican to Buenos Aires, Catholics worldwide rejoiced when Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio became the new pope. He's the first Jesuit and the first Latin American in modern times to lead the world's 1.2 billion Catholics. But in some ways, he's just a normal guy. Here are five things to know about Pope Francis: . 1. His name says a lot about him . Unlike other recent pontiffs -- John Paul II, Benedict XVI -- Pope Francis doesn't have a numeral after his name. That's because he's the first to take the name Francis. Why Francis? The pope wanted to honor St. Francis of Assisi, an admirer of nature and a servant to the poor and destitute. St. Francis of Assisi was born the son of a rich cloth merchant. But he lived in rags among beggars at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Talk Back: What kind of spiritual leader will draw people back to organized religion? Those close to Pope Francis see similarities between the two men. ""Francis of Assisi is ... someone who turned his back on the wealth of his family and the lifestyle he had, and bonded with lepers and the poor,"" said the Rev. Thomas Rosica, the Vatican's deputy spokesman. ""Here's this pope known for his care for AIDS patients and people who are very sick. Who is known for his concern with single mothers whose babies were refused to be baptized by priests in his diocese. ""He scolded those priests last year and said, 'How can you turn these people away when they belong to us? '"" Pope Francis, the pontiff of firsts, breaks with tradition . 2. He's not actually the first pope from outside Europe . Sure, Francis is the first non-European pope in modern times. But back in the 8th century, a Syrian -- Pope St. Gregory III -- led the church from 731 to 741 A.D. We've also had popes from Bethlehem (St. Evaristus, from 97 to 105 A.D.), Jerusalem (Pope Theodore I, from 642 to 649) and modern-day Libya (Saint Victor I, from 189 to 199). Several other Syrians have also been pontiff in the last few millennia. Of course, the majority of popes have been Italian. But with Francis' appointment, the tide could be shifting to outside Europe. First Latin American pope 'very exciting,' faithful say . 3. He's a pope of the people . In some ways, Pope Francis is just a normal guy. ""The new pope is a very humble man,"" said the Rev. Eduardo Mangiarotti, an Argentine priest. ""He takes public transport every day."" He also chose to live in an apartment instead of the archbishop's palace, passed on a chauffeured limousine and cooked his own meals, CNN Vatican analyst John Allen wrote in a profile published by National Catholic Reporter. In his first public act as pontiff, Pope Francis broke with tradition by asking the estimated 150,000 people packed into St. Peter's Square to pray for him, rather than him blessing the crowd first. ""He is a very simple man,"" said Luis R. Zarama, auxiliary bishop of Atlanta. ""It's very clear from the way he approached the people and asked them to bless him and pray for him. It's a beautiful sign of closeness and humility."" The pontiff broke with another tradition by refusing to use a platform to elevate himself above the cardinals standing with him as he was introduced to the world as Pope Francis. ""He said I'll stay down here,"" said Cardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York and the president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. ""He met each of us on our own level."" From public transport to popemobile: Bergoglio's journey . 4.  He comes with a side of controversy . Francis opposes same-sex marriage and abortion, which isn't surprising as leader of the socially conservative Catholic church. But as a cardinal, Francis clashed with the government of Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner over his opposition to gay marriage and free distribution of contraceptives. His career as a priest in Argentina coincided with the so-called Dirty War -- and some say the church didn't do enough to confront the military dictatorship. As many as 30,000 people died or disappeared during the seven-year period that began with a coup in 1976. Francis, in particular, was accused in a complaint of complicity in the 1976 kidnapping of two liberal Jesuit priests, Allen wrote. Francis denied the charge. ""The best evidence that I know of that this was all a lie and a series of salacious attacks was that Amnesty International who investigated that said that was all untrue,"" said Jim Nicholson, former U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See. ""These were unfair accusations of this fine priest."" But Amnesty International said it did not investigate any individual for their specific involvement. ""Our research focused on the plight of the disappeared,"" said Susanna Flood, media director for Amnesty International. Opinion: Francis, open up the church . 5. He faces a host of challenges ahead . Francis takes the helm of a church that has been rocked in recent years by sex abuse by priests and claims of corruption and infighting among the church hierarchy. He may need to find a way to draw new Catholics into the church where it is in decline, said Phillip M. Thompson, executive director of the Aquinas Center of Theology at Emory University. And he'll also need to find ways of working with shifting viewpoints among Catholics. In the United States, for example, 90% of Catholics are using contraception and 82% think it is morally permissible. ""The church has conservative positions on human sexuality, bioethics, etc., but liberal positions on issues such as economic regulation, the death penalty and immigration,"" Thompson said. ""A church divided against itself seems unlikely to renew our political or cultural structures."" Opinion: Humble, authentic and credible .","Pope Francis took his name from St. Francis, a servant to the poor .
The Argentinian is not the first pope from outside Europe .
He uses public transportation and refused to elevate himself on a platform above cardinals ."
"In a speech after the Colorado shooting Friday, President Barack Obama asked Americans to pray, reflect and remember what's important in life while the city of Aurora mourned the dead and wounded. ""If there's anything to take away from this tragedy it's the reminder that life is very fragile. Our time here is limited and it is precious. And what matters at the end of the day is not the small things, it's not the trivial things, which so often consume us and our daily lives,"" Obama said in Fort Myers, Florida, before returning to the White House. Obama on shooting: This isn't a day for politics . But Friday's shootings are likely to propel the issue of gun rights and gun safety into the national conversation again, even though the president did not address it on Friday and has largely avoided the subject while in office. Romney calls for unity after shooting . Daniel Vice, senior attorney for the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, criticized Obama on Friday for steering clear of the issue in office. For Democrats, gun politics are bad politics . ""President Obama has refused to even talk about guns. In a speech today he didn't even say the word 'gun.' The closest he came was 'gunman,' "" Vice said. ""Unfortunately the president has shown a lack of leadership in standing up to the gun lobby."" Talk of gun rights was largely absent from Obama's speech in the aftermath of the Fort Hood shooting in 2009 and after then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and others were shot in Tucson, Arizona, last year. Obama mentioned gun safety only in passing after the Tucson shootings to describe the polarizing nature of the issue. However, amid renewed discussions, the president penned an opinion piece two months after the Tucson shootings that acknowledged the importance of the Second Amendment and called for a ""focus"" on ""effective steps that will actually keep those irresponsible, law-breaking few from getting their hands on a gun in the first place."" The president's three-step plan included enforcing existing laws, rewarding states that provide the best data about gun owners and a better system for background checks. ""Clearly, there's more we can do to prevent gun violence,"" he wrote in the Arizona Daily Star. ""But I want this to at least be the beginning of a new discussion on how we can keep America safe for all our people."" But he did not go as far as he had on the campaign trail in 2008. As a candidate for president he adamantly declared he would not ""take away your guns,"" while supporting a platform that included reinstituting the assault weapons ban, stopping destruction of background check documents and closing the federal gun show loophole. ""If you've got a riffle, you got a shotgun, you've got a gun in your house, I'm not taking it away,"" Obama said in Pennsylvania in September 2008 after stressing the importance of ""common-sense gun safety measures."" Gun safety advocates have expressed disappointment with the president's actions since taking office, particularly over his failure to fight for the reinstatement of the assault weapons ban. They pointed out Obama signed bills into law that allowed loaded weapons in some national parks and on Amtrak trains and the destruction of background check documents. Advocates at the Brady Campaign said the only step he took to support their cause was backing a rule requiring gun dealers who sell multiple rifles to individuals along the border with Mexico to report the sales to law enforcement. Bloomberg issues call to action on guns . But they acknowledged their task is particularly difficult when the head of the Nation Rife Association, Wayne LaPierre, repeatedly attacks the president for working against the Second Amendment. Spokesman: NRA tweeter was 'unaware' of Colorado shooting . ""Obama has already signed on to destroy the Second Amendment and our freedom,"" LaPierre said at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February. ""(He has) endorsed a total ban on manufacture, sale and possession of all handguns."" White House spokespeople have been consistently vague when pressed on gun rights by members of the media. When asked Friday if the president would take steps to curb gun violence in the form of gun safety laws after  the Aurora shootings, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said, ""The president believes that we need to take common-sense measures that protect Second Amendment rights of Americans, while ensuring that those who should not have guns under existing law do not get them."" ""There has been progress in that regard in terms of improving the volume of quality of information in background check, but I have nothing new,"" Carney added. In July 2011, Carney said the president directed Attorney General Eric Holder and state leaders to identify measures that would improve safety and protect Second Amendment rights. ""We expect to have some more specific announcements in the near future,"" Carney said. But no announcements have been issued. Gun rights continue to divide Americans. A Pew survey released in April showed 49% of Americans found it more important to protect the rights of Americans to own guns, while 45% said it was more important to control gun ownership. The figures shifted when broken down by party ideology, race and sex. Twenty-seven percent of Democrats said it is more important to protect gun rights, while 72% of Republicans said the same. Sixty percent of men found it more important to protect gun rights and 39% of women found it more important to protect the rights of Americans to own guns. Divides also exist among campaign contributions, according to filings with the Federal Elections Commission, which show an influx of cash disproportionately geared toward Republican candidates. In the 2012 cycle, presumptive Republican presidential Mitt Romney has received $126,440 from gun rights groups, compared to Obama's $2,300. That trend is consistent with the 2008 cycle, when Sen. John McCain collected $483,711 in such contributions and Obama received $25,987.","President Obama has largely avoided the subject while in office .

"There are few certainties in American politics. But you can write it down: If Hillary Clinton wants to be the next nominee of the Democratic Party to be president, the job is hers. Joe Biden, Andrew Cuomo, Mark Warner, Martin O'Malley and the others in the long list of commander-in-chief wannabes will go about their day jobs for the next couple years, but at the back of their minds will be only one question: Will she or won't she? Because, as the most popular politician in America -- who also happens to be married to America's most popular ex-president and who has in place a nationwide network of donors, campaign staffers and committed supporters -- Clinton has the power to keep potential rivals from raising money or gaining political traction simply by saying, ""I haven't decided what my plans are."" She's in control. That she should be in such a position at this moment is a remarkable achievement and an extraordinary testament to her grit, gifts and track record: She has been the most successful U.S. secretary of state in two decades. That outcome was hardly a foregone conclusion when Barack Obama made the bold decision to pick his former primary rival to assume the oldest and most senior post in the Cabinet. She had, after all, lost a bruising campaign to him, there was tension between her team and his and no reason to assume the two ex-rivals would work together. She had never run a large organization before. Beyond that, the United States was facing massive crises at home and bewildering complexity abroad. Many of the issues she would be facing would be new to her. Clinton was so famous already that she could easily be seen to be upstaging the president, something that would have undone her within the administration and made her look bad. Avlon: Can Jindal change 'the stupid party?' Her tour de force performance this week before Senate and House committees looking into the Benghazi tragedy illustrated how far she has come. In a charged political environment, she commanded the stage and deftly repulsed effort after effort by Republican partisans to shift the focus away from what the lessons of the attacks were and should be, turning aside their theories of conspiracy and devious motives for the missteps surrounding the event. She defended the president and revealed her character by accepting responsibility. She had already set the stage with her swift embrace of a blue-ribbon investigation into the incident and her acceptance of its recommendations for avoiding such problems in the future. She was helped by the bipartisan recognition of her extraordinary tenure at State; her work ethic, miles traveled and commitment were praised throughout both hearings. Most importantly, Clinton clearly knew her brief better than any of those questioning her. When Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin attempted to score political points with a cynical line of questioning, she showed her strength and stature as a leader with a direct, unwavering response urging him to focus on the bigger issues at hand. When Sen. Rand Paul announced that had he been president he would have fired her, her response evinced an understanding of the issues and processes at play; it was evident that only one of the two of them had any chance of occupying the Oval Office in the future. When describing the return of the caskets of the American victims in the Benghazi attack, she showed her humanity. Frequently, she showed the comfort with the setting that comes from her experience not just at State but as a senator. Opinion: Rand Paul vs. Hillary Clinton: Clash of the titans . Clinton's virtuosity in such situations is no accident, nor is it a surprise to any who have watched her grow, first as a senator and then at State. Having been tested as few have been by the extraordinary stresses she faced as first lady, she famously earned her stripes in the upper chamber of our Congress by being ""a workhorse not a show horse."" Her close aides at State speak with some awe about her hours spent immersed in her briefing papers, her questioning of her staff and top experts to get up to speed, and her political skill in translating her conclusions into actions. She has worked on forging not only a good working relationship with the president but also in building key alliances in the Cabinet, notably with former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and top officials in the military and the intelligence community. When the White House limited her brief and asserted control over key issues, from the appointment of ambassadors to a host of issues in the Middle East, she found alternative paths to make a difference. The ""pivot"" to Asia was one concrete example of her success -- not as merely a policy concept but as an initiative made real by active, intensive diplomacy throughout the region. She helped restore U.S. relations worldwide that had been damaged by the bull-in-a-china-shop policies of the George W. Bush administration. She actively worked to reshape the American international agenda for the 21st century, focusing on emerging powers, new technologies and populations -- like the role of women worldwide -- long neglected by the U.S. foreign policy establishment. She led the way for the United States to be more active in Libya, to manage unprecedented international sanctions against Iran, to stand up to the Chinese in the South China Sea. Indeed, perhaps most importantly, at a time when the U.S. faced distractions and new constraints at home and a national desire to avoid military entanglements worldwide, she recognized that our greatest tools going forward would be active diplomacy and repaired alliances, and she restored them to centrality in U.S. foreign policy. It is a stand-out record, one that makes her the equal of the likes of James Baker, George Schultz or Henry Kissinger among our leading modern secretaries of state.  What is more, she achieved her success by promoting a more humanist international agenda than her peers at the first ranks of American foreign policy leaders. At the same time, she maintained a centrist course more comfortable with the appropriate use of force than many of her more liberal colleagues in the Obama administration. Maintaining such a balance requires exceptional skill. To do so for four years under the conditions she faced is among the reasons she is so widely admired. Hillary Clinton is likely to be the next Democratic presidential nominee because she is the best-known active Democratic politician, because she has repeatedly triumphed over adversity, because she has made herself well-liked at a time that politicians are typically viewed with contempt. But she is likely to be the next president, the first woman to be president of the United States, because of the quality of her character and her work on behalf of the American people. With some luck she will use the next two years to restore her energy and prepare for what lies ahead. Because regardless of what political party in which you may find yourself, it is hard to deny that she elevates our political discourse in ways that few, if any, others do on the contemporary stage.","David Rothkopf says if Hillary Clinton runs in 2016, she'll likely be the next president .

He says she's excelled as secretary of state, overcome adversity, shown political wits .

From self-driving cars to intelligent public transit systems, the future of 21st-century transportation is being mapped out right now in Silicon Valley. At the inaugural FutureCast event in Palo Alto, 50 innovative entrepreneurs, executives, policy makers and writers were invited to discuss how online technology is transforming transportation. The goal was to rethink travel in today's networked society and re-imagine the car, bus and train in the digital age. For David Frigstad, Chairman of consultancy firm Frost & Sullivan, transportation is reaching what its ""Kodak Moment."" He was referring to the way in which the photography company Kodak was catastrophically blindsided by the digital revolution in photography. This moment is every traditional CEO's worst nightmare. But, as Frigstad explained at the discussion, the disruption of today's network economy, which will enable vehicle sharing start-ups, might actually be good news for the rest of us. ""To have 100 billion cars on the planet that aren't being used is a total waste of materials, gas, petrol, metals,"" Frigstad explained. Technology author Larry Downes also stated that a change in the industry is necessary. ""We can't go on as we have,"" he said. ""We are running out of fuel; the current set of technologies we have are reaching a natural limit."" Then there's the impact of the self-driving car, which has the potential to radically reduce car crashes. ""We are looking at 100,000 deaths on the planet every year from automobile accidents, almost half a trillion dollars in damages,"" Frigstad said in support of safer, computerized self-driving vehicles. Many of the other participants at FutureCast -- who included executives from General Motors, Tesla, Sidecar, American Airlines and the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency -- agreed with Frigstad's dramatic vision. John Markoff, The New York Times' technology journalist, even compared today's situation to the historic transition from the mainframe to the personal computer. ""If we only need 20% of the cars we have,"" Markoff noted. ""There are some really disruptive things that are going to happen.""","Transportation is set to be transformed by digital technology, says many Silicon Valley commentators .

"The best kids' attractions are fun for adults, too. ""When you spend the whole day at some place like a theme park or zoo, you want everyone in your family to enjoy it -- young and old,"" said Travis Katz, CEO and co-founder of travel planning site Gogobot. That's what the site's favorite spots for kids have in common, Katz said. The 15 best attractions in the U.S. for kids, announced Tuesday as part of Gogobot's Travelers' Favorites awards, were selected based on Gogobot user recommendations and the number of visits from the site's 3.7 million users. How young is too young to travel? And the best in the U.S. for kids? That would be the Exploratorium on Pier 15 in San Francisco. The interactive learning lab features 600 exhibits. ""The slogan at the entrance says 'Touch Everything,' making it more like a giant playground than a museum,"" Katz said. Plus, there's an evening event for adults only on the first Thursday of each month, with a cash bar and film screenings in addition to the exhibits. See? Fun for everyone.

"Round One is done but this year's electoral fight between the GOP establishment and the tea party movement is far from over. Moderates scored a victory on Tuesday in North Carolina's Republican Senate primary when state House Speaker Thom Tillis topped 40% of the vote, avoiding a runoff in July. 5 takeaways from N.C. primaries . Tillis beat a bunch of more conservative candidates for the chance to face off this November against first-term Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan, who is considered very vulnerable in the general election. Flipping her seat and five others held by Democrats would give Republicans control of the Senate. ""There are plenty of fights still to come, and it's too early to proclaim a winner and a loser. But it's already clear that the pragmatist conservatives have stopped the anti-establishment's electoral momentum,"" writes Stuart Rothenberg, editor and publisher of the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report. Victories by more moderate mainstream candidates improve the GOP's odds of recapturing the Senate. Democrats hold a 55-45 majority but are defending 21 of the 36 seats up this year. Half of those Democratic seats are in red or purple states, like North Carolina. Mainstream strikes back . Since the birth of the tea party movement in 2009, primary challenges from the right have produced major headlines and headaches for the GOP and hurt the party's chances of recapturing the Senate in the past two election cycles. Candidates backed by the tea party and other grass-roots conservatives effectively cost the GOP five winnable Senate elections in 2010 and 2012 in Nevada, Delaware, Colorado, Indiana and Missouri. GOP establishment 1, tea party 0 after early primary test . This time, mainstream Republicans don't want another sequel. In North Carolina, Tillis grabbed last-minute endorsements from two high-profile Republicans: 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a potential 2016 White House hopeful. More importantly, while none of the candidates in the GOP primary, including Tillis, raised or spent a lot of money, the state House speaker won the backing of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and American Crossroads. Those outside groups spent $2.6 million combined to run ads in favor of the candidate. That spending dwarfed money shelled out by outside conservative groups that backed Greg Brannon, a first time candidate endorsed by Sen. Rand Paul, who finished second in the Senate primary. What's at stake in 2014? ""Last night was a victory for Republicans who believe we should nominate the most conservative candidate who can win in November versus the D.C. interest groups who believe the weaker the Republican Party is, the more powerful they are,"" said GOP strategist Brian Walsh, who served as National Republican Senatorial Committee communications director the past two election cycles. Was North Carolina a true test? But some conservative strategists say the showdown in North Carolina was anything but a fair fight. ""When the establishment candidate is the only player on the field actually spending significant money and also runs as conservative, they have an easy path to victory,"" Daniel Horwitz, policy director for the Madison Project, told CNN. ""However, you can only fool the people some of the time and eventually they will have to vouch for their support of amnesty, debt ceiling increases, tweaking Obamacare, and corporate welfare.  No degree of cash advantage can sell that pig to primary voters,"" he said. Since a number of influential tea party groups and conservative organizations stayed on the sidelines in North Carolina, some strategists say the contest was not a true indicator in the fight between the establishment and the grassroots movement. ""The breathless declarations on the death of the Tea Party are so premature it's laughable. The tea party was split in NC (or stayed out entirely).  Any one pointing to these elections as indicative doesn't understand the indicators of a true tea party versus establishment contest,"" wrote conservative pollster Chris Wilson. More battles ahead . There are primary elections virtually every Tuesday over the next five weeks, so  there are more skirmishes to come. Key races to watch in 2014 . May 13: Next Tuesday, the tea party could score what could end up being its only win in Senate primary showdowns this year. Conservative Ben Sasse of Nebraska, president of Midland University, has been showered with support and endorsements recently from former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee, and Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah, as well as the backing of FreedomWorks, the Senate Conservatives Fund and Club for Growth. Some polling suggests that Sasse is tied with Shane Osborn, the former state treasurer who's considered the establishment favorite. But on the same day, seven-term Rep. Shelley Moore Capito is expected to easily win the GOP  Senate nomination in West Virginia, where the party hopes to snatch the seat long held by retiring Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller. Capito is considered a moderate, and while some conservative groups criticized her early in her bid, she's faced no serious opposition from the right for the nomination. But a tea party-backed candidate might win the GOP nomination in West Virginia's 2nd Congressional District, the House seat that Capito has held for seven terms. May 20: A week later, the action moves to Kentucky, where Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell faces a challenge, and Georgia, where there's a wide open fight to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Saxby Chambliss. McConnell is challenged by businessman Matt Bevin, who enjoys strong support from many tea party groups and influential conservative organizations. While the race has seen big spending by the campaigns and outside groups, the five-term McConnell is expected to cruise to renomination. But he faces a serious challenge in November from rising Democratic star Alison Lundergan Grimes. Big-name Democrats are already campaigning for her. In Georgia, Republican Reps. Phil Gingrey, Paul Broun and Jack Kingston, former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel, and businessman David Perdue are the major candidates in the race. Kingston, Perdue and Handel, rather than the more conservative Broun and Gingrey, are considered  frontrunners in the contentious Republican primary. The winner will face Michelle Nunn, the all-but-certain Democratic nominee and daughter of former  Sen. Sam Nunn, a household name in Georgia. On the same day in Oregon, Portland pediatric neurosurgeon Monica Wehby is considered the frontrunner over more conservative state Rep. Jason Conger in the race for the GOP Senate nomination. The winner of that contest will run in November against first-term Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, who Republicans think might be vulnerable if 2014 turns into a wave year for the GOP. And in Idaho, there's a high-profile incumbent-vs.-tea party showdown in the House, where eight-term Rep. Mike Simpson faces a serious primary challenge from conservative favorite Bryan Smith. June 3: Two weeks later, the establishment-vs.-tea party contest shifts to Mississippi, which is among eight states holding primaries that day. Six-term Sen. Thad Cochran is facing a serious challenge from state lawmaker Chris McDaniel in Mississippi. Private polling shows Cochran with a comfortable lead, but outside establishment groups are taking nothing for granted. Fight is far from over . The Chamber of Commerce, which represents business interests, says it's going up on television starting Wednesday with a very large ad buy in two Senate contests and 11 House races, which include some key establishment vs. tea party primary showdowns. While mainstream candidates appear to have the upper hand in most of these upcoming showdowns, tea party leaders say don't count them out. In the days ahead, we're supporting some great candidates in competitive primaries,"" Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund spokesman Kevin Broughton told CNN. ""In my home state of Mississippi, there's a war going on; Chris McDaniel is poised to take down a six-term incumbent U.S. senator.  I haven't seen such a hotly contested primary in 20 years,"" he said. Even if the establishment rolls to victory after victory in this year's primaries, a top analyst says this battle is far from over. ""No matter the wins and losses in the GOP 'civil war' this year, don't expect this to be the end of that fight. The party remains deeply divided, and both sides have the resources and commitment needed to take the fight into 2015 and 2016. The war is likely to get messier and the division more consequential before the two sides look for ways to bridge their differences. That should please Democrats,""  Rothenberg wrote.","Establishment Republicans avoided costly runoff with tea party opponent in N.C.

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Both Kiev and Washington say that Russian forces are massing in large numbers near Ukraine's eastern border -- and that they represent a threat to Ukraine and potentially to other former Soviet states. It's hard to pin down an exact figure, amid a welter of different views, but the U.S. and Ukraine agree the number of Russian soldiers present has risen fast in recent weeks. Russia, meanwhile, says it is simply conducting exercises in its southern and western military regions. It said one battalion was pulled back from a border area Monday after completing those drills, but NATO says it cannot confirm any withdrawal. Here's what the different parties are saying about the apparent Russian troop buildup: . United States: . Russia may have as many as 40,000 troops near its western border with Ukraine, two U.S. officials said last week. But the officials stressed this was only an estimate, largely based on satellite imagery, saying that it is difficult to come to a firm assessment because the Russians are continuing to move units around. Early last week, U.S. officials put the number at more than 30,000, up by 10,000 from what it was a week to 10 days before. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Monday that if reports about Russia removing some troops from the border were accurate, ""it would be a welcome preliminary step."" Last Wednesday, a classified U.S. intelligence assessment concluded it was more likely than previously thought that Russian forces would enter eastern Ukraine, CNN learned. The buildup was seen to be reminiscent of Moscow's military moves before it went into Chechnya and Georgia in both numbers of units and their capabilities, U.S. officials said. The assessment's points included: . • The 30,000-plus troops on the border are ""significantly more"" than what is needed for the ""exercises"" Russia says it has been conducting, and there is no sign they are making any move to return to their home bases. • The troops on the border with Ukraine include large numbers of ""motorized"" units that can quickly move, as well as air defense artillery. • Additional special forces, airborne troops, air transport and other units that would be needed appear to be at a higher state of mobilization in other locations in Russia. • Additional intelligence indicates that even more Russian forces are ""reinforcing"" the border region, according to U.S. administration officials, and all of the troops are positioned for potential military action. • The United States believes Russia may move toward three eastern Ukrainian cities -- Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk -- to establish a land bridge into Crimea. • Russian forces are currently positioned in and around Rostov, Kursk and Belgorod, according to U.S. intelligence information. In a Pentagon briefing Thursday, Rear Adm. John Kirby said the United States has seen ""no specific indications"" that Russian troops are in fact conducting military exercises along the border with Ukraine and that, whether they do or not, their presence does nothing to de-escalate the situation. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel was told by his Russian counterpart, Sergey Shoigu, that the troops did not intend to cross the border but were there only to conduct military exercises. President Barack Obama on Friday urged Russia to pull back its troops. ""You've seen a range of troops massing along that border under the guise of military exercises, but these are not what Russia would normally be doing,"" he said in an interview aired by CBS News. ""It may simply be an effort to intimidate Ukraine, or it may be that they've got additional plans. ""And, in either case, what we need right now to resolve and de-escalate the situation would be for Russia to move back those troops and to begin negotiations directly with the Ukrainian government as well as the international community."" Ukraine crisis: NATO chief says no Russian troop withdrawal seen . Ukraine: . Ukraine's estimate of the number of Russian troops at the border is 88,000, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Defense and Security Council, Yarema Dukh, told CNN on Thursday. Earlier in the week, National Security Council sources put the number at up to 100,000, including units not immediately on the border that could be rapidly deployed from other nearby areas in the event of a Russian incursion into Ukraine. Also, according to Ukraine's Foreign Ministry: . • There's ""a concentration of military equipment"" in Russia's Bryansk region -- which borders northeastern Ukraine and Belarus -- near the town of Churovichi and Klimovskiy district, about 18 kilometers (11 miles) from the border. • On March 25, two trains up to 60 cars long arrived at Klimovo train station, about 16 miles northeast of Churovichi, carrying troops and equipment. • According to intelligence reports, camps, communication systems, medical facilities and military field facilities have been set up in the area. • Russia is using intelligence activities from the air in border areas; 40 drone flights were reported in two days this week in Ukraine's eastern border control area. Russia: . Russia's Defense Ministry says it is carrying out snap military exercises in its southern and western districts. The numbers it says are involved in the drills -- due to run until the end of March -- are much smaller than those cited by Washington or Kiev. • One Russian infantry battalion is being withdrawn from Russia's southern Rostov region, having finished military exercises, state news agency ITAR-Tass reported Monday. It is returning to its base in the Samara region, hundreds of miles from the border, the outlet said, citing Russia's Defense Ministry. It's not clear how many soldiers are concerned, but a battalion would typically number in the hundreds. • On March 13, Russia said that about 8,500 members of artillery units were training in the southern military district, using weaponry including multiple rocket launchers, howitzers and anti-tank cannons. • These artillery exercises are taking place in the Rostov, Belgorod, Kursk and Tambov regions, all near the border with Ukraine. • On March 11, the Defense Ministry said about 4,000 paratroopers were taking part in airborne exercises in Russia's western military district, including the Kursk region, which borders Ukraine. • Russia also had about 22,000 troops in Crimea as of last week, according to President Vladimir Putin. Up to 25,000 were allowed in Crimea under the terms of Russia's lease of the Sevastopol naval base there. Is Crimea gone? NATO: . Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Monday that NATO ""cannot confirm that Russia is withdrawing its troops"" from Ukraine's border. ""This is not what we're seeing. And this massive military buildup can in no way contribute to a de-escalation of the situation,"" he said. Gen. Philip Breedlove, head of the U.S. European Command and military chief of NATO, previously said the Russian force is ""very sizable."" In remarks on March 23, he described Russia's snap military exercises as ""worrisome,"" suggesting they had been used as a tool to bring Russian forces into a high state of readiness without prompting a NATO response. ""A snap exercise puts an incredible force at a border. The force that is at the Ukrainian border now to the east is very, very sizable and very, very ready,"" he said. ""You cannot defend against that if you are not there to defend against it. So I think we need to think about our allies, the positioning of our forces in the alliance and the readiness of those forces in the alliance, such that we can be there to defend against it, if required, especially in the Baltics and other places."" Breedlove also voiced worries that Russian troops could roll into Ukraine's southwestern city of Odessa and Moldova's separatist region of Transnistria, on the opposite side of Ukraine. ""There is absolutely sufficient force postured on the eastern border of Ukraine to run to Transnistria if the decision was made to do that,"" he said. Analysis from Igor Sutyagin, of UK-based defense think tank RUSI: . Sutyagin, an expert on Russian military matters whose assessment is based on Russian, Ukrainian and Eastern sources, rather than Western, puts the number of Russian combat troops at 30,000 to 40,000 in total. Including the support troops also present, for example in transport and communications units, gives a significantly higher number and explains the disparity in estimates given by Ukraine and others, he added. There are four groups of these Russian forces dispersed along the borders of Ukrainian territory, he said. One group is in Crimea, the southeastern peninsula now annexed to Russia, while the three other groups are positioned in a kind of triangle oriented toward three eastern Ukrainian cites: Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk. There are also reserve forces deeper in Russian territory. The forces grouped in southern Russia, near the cities of Taganrog and Rostov on Don, number several thousand, he said. Sutyagin says he does not believe that forces in Russia's western and southern military districts are on the snap exercises claimed by the Ministry of Defense. One indication is that they are in nontraditional training areas, he said. Other signs are that the troops are carrying out only low-level activities, that the supposed drills are lasting for longer than usual, and that the forces are dispersed over a wider area than might be expected. ""If that is the exercise, it's an exercise to invade Ukraine,"" said Sutyagin. This doesn't mean Russia will invade tomorrow, but it does show clearly what Russia's military planners may have in mind if they do go into the eastern region of Ukraine with the intention of severing it from the rest of the country, he said. In that scenario, the Russian combat troops in Crimea could act as a powerful second front designed to strike into the rear of Ukraine's forces as they defend an assault from the east. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London, while Barbara Starr reported in Washington and Karl Penhaul in Kiev. CNN's Alla Eshchenko, Shirley Henry and Alexander Felton, and journalist Victoria Butenko contributed to this report.","NEW: NATO chief says he can't confirm Russian withdrawal from area bordering Ukraine .

"Devo guitarist Bob Casale died Monday, his brother and band mate announced Tuesday. Casale was 61. He was known by fans as ""Bob 2"" since he played alongside guitarist Bob Mothersbaugh, the brother of Devo co-founder Mark Mothersbaugh. ""As an original member of Devo, Bob Casale was there in the trenches with me from the beginning,"" his brother Gerald Casale said in a Facebook posting. ""He was my level-headed brother, a solid performer and talented audio engineer, always giving more than he got."" The new-wave band began after Gerald Casale and Mark Mothersbaugh met as art students at Kent State University. The group wrote its first music in May 1970 -- the same month National Guard troops fired on antiwar protesters on the Kent State campus, killing four students. Devo actively toured in recent years, including a televised performance playing at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada. ""He was excited about the possibility of Mark Mothersbaugh allowing Devo to play shows again,"" Gerald Casale wrote in his brother's death announcement. ""His sudden death from conditions that led to heart failure came as a total shock to us all."" Mark Mothersbaugh issued a statement Tuesday saying he was ""shocked and saddened"" by Casale's death. ""He not only was integral in Devo's sound, he worked over 20 years at Mutato, collaborating with me on 60 or 70 films and television shows, not to mention countless commercials and many video games,"" said Mothersbaugh.  ""Bob was instrumental in creating the sound of projects as varied as Rugrats and Wes Anderson's films. He was a great friend. I will miss him greatly."" Mutato is the name of the band's headquarters, a landmark on Hollywood's Sunset Boulevard. The band's name was derived from the word ""de-evolution"" -- the idea that humans are regressing into a destructive herd mentality, Gerald Casale told CNN in an interview in February 2010. ""When you think about 1980, if somebody would have showed you in a crystal ball (for) 2010, you would have thought it was a bad joke,"" Casale said. ""De-evolution happened and now everybody agrees. They don't think we're crazy. They know that it was true."" Devo drummer Alan Myers, who was with the group from 1976 to 1986, died last year.

"Despite food safety measures, the threat of foodborne illness remains in meat and produce -- and some types of illness are on the rise. About 48 million people contract some form of food poisoning each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Salmonella remained the top cause of foodborne illness last year, according to the CDC's 2012 report card on food poisoning. However, the overall instance of Salmonella was unchanged from the 2006-08 data, the agency said. The report card is based on reports from 10 U.S. regions, representing about 15% of the country. The second most common cause of illness was Campylobacter, which increased 14% over the 2006-08 data, the CDC said. Campylobacter lives on live chickens and can taint meat during slaughter; it can also be found in raw, unpasteurized milk. Chicken and ground beef top a list of ""risky meat"" published by the Center for Science in the Public Interest. Researchers from this advocacy group examined data from foodborne illness outbreaks over a 12-year period and found between 1998 and 2010, meat and poultry products were linked to ""at least 1,714 outbreaks involving 33,372 illnesses."" That estimate may only be the tip of the iceberg, the group said, as people may not seek medical attention for food poisoning and cases go unrecorded. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has an online reporting tool for those who think they might have a foodborne illness. ""We applaud CSPI's ongoing efforts to educate consumers about food safety,"" Dr. Elisabeth Hagen, the USDA's undersecretary for food safety, said in a statement. ""While we have made progress in making food safer -- including cutting E. coli O157-related illnesses in half -- we still have work to do. As Salmonella rates continue to stagnate, we look forward to CSPI's support, and the support of other groups committed to food safety, of our efforts to reduce this dangerous foodborne pathogen, including modernization of the poultry inspection system."" In April, the Environmental Working Group published an analysis of existing data on antibiotic-resistant bacteria contained in meat sold in supermarkets. Eighty-one percent of ground chicken, 69% of pork chops, 55% of ground beef and 39% of chicken were found to contain the bacteria, the organization reported, citing data from a February Food and Drug Administration report. Antibiotic resistance reduces doctors' options to treat you if you become ill. What government tests found in your meat . Every year the Environmental Working Group publishes its ""dirty dozen"" fruits and vegetables. The advocacy group describes it as a consumer shoppers' guide to determine which types of produce pose the highest threat of pesticides. Although pesticides are not a cause of foodborne illness, produce can be a source of food poisoning. In 2012, cantaloupes, spinach and spring mix salad and mangoes were linked to outbreaks. Improving food safety begins before the products ever reach the consumer, at the slaughterhouse and in the fields, but ""being careful in the kitchen is also very important,"" said Dr. Robert Tauxe, deputy director of the CDC's Division of Foodborne, Waterborne and Environmental Diseases. So what's a consumer to do? At the store . A CDC study published in 2010 once again highlighted the fact that young children can be exposed to raw meat and poultry products while riding in shopping carts, particularly if they ride in the basket of the cart. Researchers suggest that parents keep their child away from these products, which could be leaking juices carrying bacteria, by placing their child in the cart's seat, and not place meat or poultry products in the seat while shopping to avoid contamination. All consumers can benefit from separating their raw meat, poultry and seafood purchases from other food products to prevent cross-contamination. The USDA recommends placing these types of foods in plastic bags and also placing these purchases in separate shopping bags at checkout. Storage . Packaging meat products in leak-proof containers would also help cut cross-contamination. New Zealand, for instance, saw a significant reduction in foodborne illness after mandating leak-proof packaging, Tauxe said. When you get home, storing raw meats in a plastic bag or container to prevent any juices from dripping on other foods is also important. Listeria monocytogenes, another type of illness-causing bacteria, can grow in foods in the refrigerator, according to the CDC. Use an appliance thermometer to check the temperature inside the fridge; it should be 40 degrees or lower, and the freezer should be 0 degrees or lower. Food preparation . Start with clean hands. Wash with soap and water for 20 seconds (sing ""Happy Birthday"" twice) before and after handling food -- and after other activities, such as changing diapers or using the bathroom. Ideally, use separate cutting boards for fruits and vegetables and raw meat to avoid cross-contamination. Wash fruits and vegetables under running water. Scrubbing melons and cucumbers with a clean brush is recommended; using soap to clean them is not. Some home cooks wash their meat under running water before cooking, but, experts say, that can spread contaminated juices in places that may not be visible. Use hot, soapy water to clean utensils and cutting boards after preparing foods; use hot, soapy water and paper towels or clean towels to clean work surfaces. Proper cooking is essential for meat, poultry and seafood. Cooking temperatures have to reach a certain temperature to destroy bacteria such as E. Coli and Salmonella; a meat thermometer is the only way to be sure those temperatures have been reached. A thermometer should be placed in the thickest part of the meat without touching the bone. Ground beef, lamb and poultry should be cooked to 160 degrees Fahrenheit; whole chickens, turkeys and poultry parts to 165 degrees; and whole cuts of meat-like steaks, chops and roasts to 145 degrees, followed by three minutes of rest time before carving or eating. Storing leftovers . Harmful bacteria can start growing at room temperature, so any leftovers should go into the fridge or freezer within two hours of cooking. Storage times for the fridge and freezer can vary depending on the food.","Meat, fruit and vegetables can all pose a risk of foodborne illness .

"Washington (CNN) -- Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday that justices on the nation's highest court should be even-handed and impartial in order to promise ""nothing less than a fair shake for every American."" In her opening statement to her confirmation hearing, Kagan sought to address Republican concerns that her background as an academic and policy specialist in the Clinton administration would bring a liberal bias in her court rulings. The role of the Supreme Court is ""to safeguard the rule of law, through a commitment to even-handedness, principle, and restraint,"" Kagan said. ""I will make no pledges this week other than this one -- that if confirmed, I will remember and abide by all these lessons,"" she said after describing her experiences as a Supreme Court clerk, law school professor and U.S. solicitor general. ""I will listen hard, to every party before the court and to each of my colleagues. I will work hard. And I will do my best to consider every case impartially, modestly, with commitment to principle, and in accordance with law."" If confirmed by the 19-member committee and then the full Senate, Kagan would be the 112th Supreme Court justice and the fourth woman to sit on the nation's highest court. While her confirmation is considered likely, Republican senators on the panel questioned Monday whether Kagan can be an impartial justice, displaying a partisan divide over President Barack Obama's second Supreme Court nomination since he took office in January 2009. The Senate confirmed Obama's first candidate, Sonia Sotomayor, last year. The committee's seven Republicans used their opening statements to challenge Kagan's judicial experience and her ability to put aside personal politics, and the 12 Democratic members praised Kagan's qualifications and welcomed her possible presence on a court they criticized for what they called conservative activism. Kagan sat impassively in the packed room, sometimes taking a sip of water, as the senators outlined the questioning she will face in coming days. Committee Chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, said Kagan would be an independent Supreme Court justice, and that he advised her to be open in expressing her judicial philosophy at her confirmation hearing. Citing her record as the first woman to be dean of Harvard Law School and the first woman solicitor general of the United States, Leahy said America is ""a better country for the fact that the path of excellence Elena Kagan has taken in her career is one now open to both men and women."" However, the ranking Republican on the panel, Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, said Kagan lacks judicial experience and has a record of supporting liberal political causes. ""While academia certainly has value, there is no substitute, I think, for being in the harness of the law, handling real cases,"" Sessions said. Other Republicans said Kagan's experience as a clerk for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall indicated she would seek to push society toward desired ideological or political ends, rather than apply existing law. ""Will the Constitution control her, or will she try to control the Constitution?"" asked Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. ""Does she believe that judges may control the Constitution by changing its meaning?"" Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California accused Republicans of casting a ""drift net"" for any disqualifying fact in Kagan's record, saying the GOP effort failed. ""I believe you are eminently confirmable,"" Feinstein said, turning the tables on Republican concerns about Kagan's lack of judicial experience by saying: ""Frankly, I find this refreshing."" Other Democrats harshly criticized the current Supreme Court for what they characterized as rulings based on conservative activism. They cited the Citizens United ruling in January, in which the high court voted 5-4 to give big businesses, unions and nonprofits more power to spend freely in federal elections, which they said threatens a century of government efforts to regulate the power of corporations to bankroll American politics. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, called the Supreme Court's shift to the right under Chief Justice John Roberts ""palpable."" ""In decision after decision, this court bends the law to suit"" a conservative political ideology, Schumer said, calling Kagan ""a terrific antidote to the lack of practical real-world understanding of the court."" However, Republican Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona said Kagan's record is full of ""warning signs"" that she may be what he called a ""results-oriented"" justice -- which is conservative code language for liberal activism. Citing her record as clerk for Marshall, Kyl said many of her memos then ""appeared to be based largely on her own liberal political views."" ""This kind of naked political judgment appears frequently throughout Kagan's work as a Supreme Court clerk,"" Kyl said. Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois responded that America is a better nation due to Marshall's personal empathy in ruling on influential civil rights cases. ""Our Supreme Court is badly in need of a person of your skill and knowledge and background,"" Durbin said.","NEW: First day of Elena Kagan's Supreme Court confirmation hearing concludes with her opening statement .

"Go ahead, order the sushi. Levels of radioactivity found in Pacific bluefin tuna that spawned off Japan around the time of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident are far below anything that would pose a health risk and have dropped in fish caught the following year, U.S. researchers reported Monday. The latest findings follow up on a 2012 study that found radioactive cesium, a nuclear reactor byproduct, in tuna caught off California in the months after the triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi. The attention that study received led scientists to take another look at the data, said Nicholas Fisher, a marine science professor at New York's Stony Brook University. ""People did not know how to translate that into a dose, or into what risk do I have from eating that tuna,"" Fisher said. ""The paper that's coming out today addresses that."" They found that anyone who eats the bluefin -- highly prized for sushi and sashimi -- would get about 5% of the radiation they'd get from eating one typical banana, a fruit high in naturally radioactive potassium. The results were released Monday by the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Even subsistence fishermen, who eat far more fish than the typical American, would receive a dose of radiation from the cesium isotopes released in the meltdown equivalent to a single dental X-ray, Fisher and his colleagues reported. That translates to a ""worst-case scenario"" of two additional cancer deaths for every 10 million people in that category, he said. The doses were calculated from fish caught off San Diego in August 2011. A follow-up study with fish caught in 2012 found the amount of cesium-134 and -137 dropped by about half in those tuna, Fisher said. ""Even if we use the higher concentrations, the concentrations we measured in 2011, the doses to human consumers are very low, and lower than the naturally occurring radionuclides,"" he said. Cesium-137 has a radioactive half-life of about 30 years, and traces of the isotope still persist from above-ground nuclear bomb tests in the 1950s and '60s. But cesium-134, which has a half-life of only two years, clearly came from the meltdowns, the researchers say. There are other reasons to worry about the Pacific bluefin, such as overfishing and mercury contamination. Anyone who eats a large quantity of bluefin over a long period would be more likely to see ill effects from mercury -- which can damage the brain and nervous systems of young or unborn children -- before facing the threat of cancer from radioactive cesium, Fisher said. The three operating reactors at Fukushima Daiichi melted down after the earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan in March 2011, creating the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986. The crippled plant's owner is still trying to manage hundreds of thousands of tons of radioactive water used to cool the reactors, and scientists believe some of that is still seeping into the Pacific. The waters near the plant remain closed to fishing, and Japan has tightened its standards to keep any contaminated catch from reaching consumers. While the earthquake killed more than 15,000 people, no deaths have been blamed on the nuclear disaster that followed. In May, the World Health Organization concluded that only a small group of people will face an additional cancer risk from the meltdowns, but more than 100,000 people have had to evacuate towns surrounding the plant.","Scientists linked cesium from Fukushima Daiichi to bluefin tuna in 2011 .

"On Friday President Obama will address the nation about the NSA's controversial surveillance programs. He is expected to announce some substantive changes to those programs which collect data about the phone calls of every American. After the first leaks by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden were published in June, Obama defended the NSA's surveillance programs during a visit to Berlin, saying: ""We know of at least 50 threats that have been averted because of this information not just in the United States, but, in some cases, threats here in Germany. So lives have been saved."" Similarly, Gen. Keith Alexander, the director of the NSA, testified before Congress that ""the information gathered from these programs provided the U.S. government with critical leads to help prevent over 50 potential terrorist events in more than 20 countries around the world."" Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said on the House floor in July that 54 times the NSA programs ""stopped and thwarted terrorist attacks both here and in Europe -- saving real lives."" However, a New America Foundation review of the government's claims about the role that NSA ""bulk"" surveillance of phone and e-mail communications records has had in keeping the United States safe from terrorism found that these claims are overblown and even misleading. An in-depth analysis of 225 individuals recruited by al Qaeda or a like-minded group, or inspired by al Qaeda ideology, and charged in the United States with an act of terrorism since 9/11, demonstrated that traditional investigative methods, such as the use of informants, tips from local communities, and targeted intelligence operations, provided the initial impetus for investigations in the majority of cases, while the contribution of NSA's bulk surveillance programs to these cases was minimal. (Click on the link to go to a database of all these 225 individuals and additional details about them and the government's investigations of these cases. ) The controversial bulk collection of American telephone metadata, which includes the telephone numbers that originate and receive calls, as well as the time of those calls but not their content, under Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, appears to have played an identifiable role in, at most, 1.8% of these cases. This finding corrobrated that of the Obama-appointed White House review group who had access to classified materials that concluded in December that ""section 215 telephony meta-data was not essential to preventing attacks."" Our study also found that NSA programs involving the surveillance of non-U.S. persons outside of the United States under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act played a role in 4.4 percent of the terrorism cases we examined, and NSA surveillance under an unidentified authority played a role in 1.3 percent of cases we examined. In 27 percent of the cases we reviewed, court records and public reporting do not identify which specific methods initiated the investigation. These cases, involving 62 individuals, may have been initiated by an undercover informant, an undercover officer, a family member tip, other traditional law enforcement methods, CIA- or FBI-generated intelligence, NSA surveillance of some kind, or any number of other methods. Furthermore, our examination of the role of the database of U.S. citizens' telephone metadata in the single plot the government uses to justify the importance of the program -- that of Basaaly Moalin, a San Diego cabdriver who in 2007 and 2008 provided $8,500 to Al-Shabaab, al Qaeda's affiliate in Somalia -- calls into question the necessity of the Section 215 bulk collection program. According to the government, the database of American phone metadata allows intelligence authorities to quickly circumvent the traditional burden of proof associated with criminal warrants, thus allowing them to ""connect the dots"" faster and prevent future 9/11-scale attacks. Yet in the Moalin case, after using the NSA's phone database to link a number in Somalia to Moalin, the FBI waited two months to begin an investigation and wiretap his phone. This undercuts the government's theory that the database of Americans' telephone metadata is necessary to expedite the investigative process, since it clearly didn't expedite the process in the single case the government uses to extol its virtues. In sum,  the surveillance of American phone metadata has had no discernible impact on preventing acts of terrorism and only the most marginal of impacts on preventing terrorist-related activity, such as fundraising for a terrorist group. Given that, what should the Obama administration do about the NSA's phone data collection program, which keeps the phone data of all Americans for five years? President Obama has a number of potential choices. The first is to continue the program as is. Another is to give the phone collection program to some kind of private third party entity, and another is to mandate that the phone companies keep the data. There are problems with all these approaches. The status quo is open to legal challenges. Judge Richard J. Leon of the District of Columbia ruled in December that the program likely violates the Constitution. Another federal judge, in New York, ruled in favor of the program a week later, so its legal fate might have to be determined by higher courts. Giving the data collection program to some kind of government-nominated private third party will likely be seen as just another way for the government to store the data. And the phone companies don't want the costs and headaches of storing five years of data. There is another approach that should be considered, which is to abandon the bulk phone data collection program entirely and go back to the tried and true approach of having the government get a court order to look at a suspect's phone records, rather than leaving that decision to the discretion of a group of anonymous officials at NSA, as is now the case. This hardly seems onerous. After all, since 1979 judges have only turned down 0.3% of the requests they have received for warrants involving cases of suspected espionage or terrorism. But such a move would assure Americans that there was some sort of due process going on whenever their phone records are examined by the government. And this seems closer to the spirit of the Fourth Amendment, which guards against ""unreasonable searches,"" than does the present system. Thanks to David Sterman and Emily Schneider for their research help.","Bergen: New America Foundation finds little value to mass surveillance program .

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- Hurricane Ida made landfall Thursday morning over east central Nicaragua, pelting the Central American nation with heavy rain and weakening to a tropical storm. At 1 p.m. ET, Ida had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 kph) with higher gusts, the National Hurricane Center said. It was earlier a Category 1 Hurricane with 75 mph winds. Flash floods and mudslides in Nicaragua and Honduras are expected. Because Ida is a slow-moving storm -- it had been nearly stationary for the past few hours, the hurricane center said -- rainfall totals could approach 30 inches in some locations. The storm is expected to weaken as it moves over Nicaragua and into Honduras, the National Hurricane Center said. Are you ready for Ida? Share your photos, videos and stories . Ida is forecast to emerge into the western Caribbean Sea on Saturday morning and then slowly move toward the north-northwest, brushing past Cancun, Mexico, on Monday afternoon. After that, forecast models offer a variety of possibilities as to which way the storm could head and how intense it could be. Ida, or remnants of the storm, could make landfall anywhere along the U.S. Gulf Coast late next week. It is too early to pinpoint a specific location. Track Ida's projected path . Coastal flooding and dangerous riptides will be possible this weekend along coastal Louisiana and Mississippi because of an area of low pressure in the western Gulf of Mexico and a strong area of high pressure over the mid-Atlantic Ocean. Ida may contribute to the abnormally high tides early next week. Ida is the Atlantic region's ninth named storm. The Atlantic hurricane season ends November 30. CNN meteorologist Sean Morris contributed to this report.","Ida came ashore in Nicaragua as Category 1 hurricane .

"The serial revelations by Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who stole and leaked classified government information, have ignited a variety of disputes in the United States and  around the world. Is the collection of metadata, detailed records of phone calls and other communications, as benign or as malignant as it has been portrayed?  What are the proper limits in conducting electronic surveillance of geopolitical allies or of ordinary citizens?  How much government espionage activity must be publicly available to really give meaning to the concept of ""consent of the governed""?  Is it appropriate to secretly compel private enterprise to assist in intelligence collection? Tough questions all, but they give rise to another even more important one.  Will the Internet as we know it survive the barrage of headlines and accusations? As commonplace as the net has become, it's hard for even older folks to remember the world before we all became wired.   And younger generations don't even try to picture that benighted universe. But the net is recent, the product of visionaries like Vinton Cerf and his colleagues at Stanford in the early 1970s; they developed the Internet's original protocols for the Department of Defense so department  labs and a few universities could pass among themselves large volumes of data quickly and easily.  The World Wide Web that would take off from that Defense Department start would be a multistakeholder enterprise: nongovernmental, collaborative and (certainly at its origin) largely American. The Americans (i.e., the various Internet governance structures, like ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, anchored in the United States and operating under a contract with the U.S. government) proved good stewards, nurturing an enterprise that was ubiquitous, free, unitary, egalitarian and democratic.  Information has never flowed as freely or in such volume as it does today, enabling global commerce and global expression on an unprecedented scale. And in that, the Web was consistent with the traditional American emphasis on free enterprise and free speech, values not universally shared in today's world. As Americans fret about the theft of personal information and intellectual property and the threat of cyberattack (dark forces leveraging the Web's ubiquity and connectivity for dark purposes), others are attacking the very essence of the network.  They are less concerned about theft and more concerned that their citizens can access information -- any information -- as well as make their voices heard globally. In December 2012, Russia and China pushed very hard at a meeting in Dubai of the World Conference for International Telecommunications to wrest ""control"" of the Internet from its traditional governance structures (increasingly international but still with a strong American flavor) and hand it to this U.N.-sponsored body.  Their apparent purpose was to make it easier for them to impose controls on their digital ""territory"" and on their citizens, to transfer to cyberdomain authorities control they had long exercised in physical space. Google CEO Eric Schmidt and his co-author Jared Cohen anticipated this in their thought provoking work, ""The New Digital Age,"" in which they warned of the Balkanization of the Web, with countries establishing ""sovereignty"" over their digital domains and demanding the digital equivalents of visas and passports before allowing entry to their national domains, and, in the case of their own citizens, exit. Indeed, they proved prescient as countries like Brazil and Indonesia are already establishing digital ""residency requirements,"" demanding that prospective cloud service providers retain data only on servers in their sovereign space, a requirement that flies in the face of the very nature and inherent advantages of a global Web. At the 2012 Dubai conference, the Russians and the Chinese got strong support from places like Iran and the Arab world, but garnered support from 89 countries, falling short of the two thirds required. And now enters Snowden. It actually doesn't matter how accurate or inaccurate, precise or overdrawn, the headlines are as they allege that the United States and Britain are taking unconstrained advantage of the Web for espionage.  (I, for one, doubt that NSA and Britain's Government Communications Headquarters, are actually that interested in the personal data of the 1.5 billion people who have downloaded Angry Birds, to cite but one recent accusation.) But the Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians and others will use these headlines to buttress their case and to undercut Western arguments based on free expression and free access to information. The next meeting of the International Telecommunications Union, a U.N. agency, is in Busan this October and prospects are not good for holding the line on the multistakeholder model of Internet governance,  as governments demand more direct control. The current phrase to describe that development is ""splinternet"" and if that occurs we will be faced with multiple ironies. The United States, the creator of the Web as we know it, will have hastened its end through its espionage sins, real or imagined. And Edward Snowden, who by all accounts is a near constant habitué of that idyllic universe, will have lit the fuse of its destruction.","Hayden: Snowden revelations raised questions about data collection, surveillance .
He says some nations leveraging this to change Web's governance, control citizens .

"The shocking video of James Foley being beheaded in Syria has set off multiple investigations into the mystery of who killed the American journalist. A day after the British ambassador to the United States said that experts in his country are close to identifying the killer, two U.S. law enforcement officials told CNN that counterterrorism experts are still unable to ID Foley's executioner. U.S. analysts said it's not knowable from the video released by ISIS who carried out Foley's killing, because the entire slaying is not shown. A man moves a knife across Foley's neck, then the picture fades to black. Now one forensics expert has raised the issue that there appear to be two militants in the video. It's one of several puzzles, but there are a number of clues as to who committed this horrible act and where. 1. Accent . The focus has been on a man in the video who has a British accent. Peter Westmacott, British ambassador to the United States, said Sunday that British agents have been using ""very sophisticated technologies, voice identification and so on"" to identify the suspect.  ""We are very close to identifying who this guy is,"" he said. Martin Barry, an audio expert, told CNN it sounded like the way someone in a certain area of London would talk. ""The speaker is using a variety of English known as multicultural London English and that's a kind of melting pot accent that's emerged in recent years, particularly in deprived, multi-ethnic areas of inner London,"" Barry said. There is only one voice heard on the audio track. 2. Stature . But Ross Patel, a forensics expert who spoke to CNN, said there is another man, and he might be the actual killer. The second militant appears on the video after an obvious edit. ""There's definitely a change of actor,"" Patel said. ""There are noticeable, there are subtle but there are also noticeable changes in their build, their physical appearance."" The video contains other data like the measurements of a face, even though it is hidden. That could help investigators sift through databases of passport photos. 3. Knives . The man who speaks holds a knife in one of his hands. It looks to be a different knife than the one that was left next to Foley's body. The dimensions and style of the knives are slightly different, Patel said. 4. Holster . When trying to determine whether the British-accented man is also the killer, it helps to examine where his pistol is holstered. It is underneath his left armpit -- that is for use by his right hand. But the executioner appears on the video to be left-handed. It's unclear why this happened. 5. Location . Blogger Eliot Higgins looked at the background of the video. Behind the men is a road going over the hilly terrain. On the right side of the frame is a dip in the hills, one Higgins matched to a break he found in an image on Google Earth. There was another camera angle used in the video and in the distance there is a field and some buildings. He believes the clues show the video was recorded south of the town of Raqqa in north central Syria.","One forensics expert says there are definitely two militants in video .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Accused investment swindler Bernard L. Madoff will plead guilty later this week to 11 counts that could bring a sentence of 150 years in prison, one of his attorneys told CNN. Bernard L. Madoff is charged in one of the largest investment fraud schemes on record. Prosecutors stressed that there is no plea deal and that Madoff, 70, will have to forfeit any money he made from his crimes. ""The government has not entered into any agreement with Mr. Madoff about his plea or sentencing,"" said acting U.S. Attorney Lev L. Dassin. ""The filing of these charges does not end the matter. Our investigation is continuing."" Madoff attorney Ira Lee Sorkin said his client has agreed to plead guilty to crimes including money laundering, perjury and fraud. Earlier, Sorkin and defense attorney Daniel Horowitz told CNN that Madoff was waiving his right to a grand jury indictment and that the defense team had been talking about a plea with government attorneys. ""We obviously have talked to the government,"" said Horowitz. ""And we have been professional with each other.""  Watch details of the plea agreement » . Madoff is a former chairman of the NASDAQ stock market and founder of an innovative Wall Street trading firm that electronically matched buy and sell orders. He is accused of running a massive fraud, allegedly using new investment money from clients to fund other customers' apparent gains. It was, ""basically, a giant Ponzi scheme,"" Madoff said, according to the government's criminal complaint.  Follow the milestones in the case against Madoff » . ""There is no innocent explanation,"" Madoff told two FBI agents, according to the complaint, which states Madoff expects to go to jail. Madoff was charged in December with one count of securities fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. He has remained out on $10 million bail, but is confined to his luxurious Upper East Side apartment. In court documents, prosecutors said Madoff had run his scheme ""from at least the 1980s until his arrest on December 11, 2008, ... by soliciting billions of dollars of funds under false pretenses, failing to invest investors' funds as promised, and misappropriating and converting investors' funds to Madoff's own benefit."" The charges also say Madoff's company, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities (BLMIS), claimed that as of November 30, 2008, it held 4,800 client accounts worth about $64.8 billion. ""In fact, BLMIS held only a small fraction of that balance on behalf of its clients,"" the documents say. Madoff is scheduled appear at a plea proceeding on Thursday before U.S. District Judge Denny Chin. Chin also ruled Tuesday that Madoff can keep Sorkin on as his attorney after Madoff said he was satisfied the attorney was representing his interests despite potential conflicts of interest. Sorkin told the government he invested $18,860 with Madoff in the early 1990s through a retirement account that had been set up with his former law firm and was later transferred to another brokerage firm in 1995. Also, Sorkin's late father held an account with Madoff, the proceeds of which were eventually distributed to trust accounts for Sorkin's two sons. Sorkin also has represented a Florida accounting firm, Avellino & Bienes, which invested with Madoff. Sorkin told CNN he has received death threats and anti-Semitic hate mail. CNN sent an e-mail to one of the originating electronic address but received no reply. ""These people need to take Civics 101,"" Sorkin told CNN. ""It is extremely disappointing that people who should know better have no understanding of the role defense lawyers play in preserving our system of justice."" The senders display a ""lack of understanding of the constitution and bill of rights and how it applies to everyone,"" Sorkin added. ""As for the remarks I can only have sympathy for these people who treat this representation as some religious quest.""","Bernard L. Madoff has agreed to plead guilty to 11 counts in Ponzi scheme .

"Hugo Chavez is one of the leading leftist figures in Latin America -- and one of the United States' most vocal critics. His personal history is as colorful as his larger-than-life persona. When first elected in 1998, Chavez became at age 44 the youngest person in the nation's history to become president. He's now 58. He advances a social agenda seeking to lift people out of poverty, and he is close friends with Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Chavez comes from a military background. He joined the Venezuelan army in 1975 and rose to lieutenant colonel by 1990. He became involved in a coup attempt against President Carlos Andres Perez and was imprisoned for two years for his role, until 1994. Upon release, he formed the opposition Fifth Republic Movement, eventually catapulting him to the presidency. He was sworn into office in 1999 and his government created a new constitution that was approved at the end of same year. In 2000, he was reelected to the presidency for a six-year term under the new constitution. But within two years, he faced major setbacks. An economic crisis ignited violent demonstrations, one of which left 16 protesters and one police officer dead in Caracas in 2002. Chavez then briefly stepped down from the presidency, but after further unrest from supporters, he was reinstated. He overcame a recall election in 2004. He weathered a call for his assassination by conservation Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson in 2005. In 2006, Chavez rebuked President George W. Bush in a speech at the U.N. General Assembly when the Venezuelan leader stated: ""The devil came here yesterday, and it smells of sulfur still today."" By 2011, his health took a turn for the worse. Chavez revealed he was receiving treatment for cancer. He went through several rounds of chemotherapy in Cuba in 2011 and this year. In May, speculation intensified over who would succeed Chavez when he named 10 people to the highest circle of presidential advisers. But in July, Chavez announced he was cancer free.","Hugo Chavez was first elected in 1998 at age 44 .

"Wild cheers and applause greeted Dr. Craig Spencer as he spoke publicly for the first time after being cured of Ebola. Wearing a blue sweater and smiling during the press conference at New York's Bellevue Hospital, the American physician seemed the picture of health, less than a month since he was diagnosed with the deadly viral hemorrhagic fever. With Spencer free of the virus, all U.S. patients who had Ebola have recovered. He said he was ""very proud"" to have treated patients in Guinea with Doctors Without Borders, and urged that the focus return squarely to the West African nations where the disease has infected and killed thousands. ""I cried as I held children"" who had Ebola who were not strong enough to battle the virus, Spencer said. He witnessed families torn apart and entire communities destroyed and felt ""immense joy"" when family members who survived returned his kindness by inviting him into their homes. Spencer said that while he was in the hospital battling the virus, his friends called him from Guinea and asked how they could help him. ""They are the true heroes that we are not talking about,"" he said. He also said that early detection and reporting of symptoms worked in his situation and that should illustrate the importance of sticking to protocols that health professionals worldwide are urging to bring Ebola under control. There have been 13,268 reported Ebola cases in eight affected countries since the outbreak began, with 4,960 reported deaths, according to the World Health Organization. The vast majority of these cases have been in three West African countries -- Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. About 50% of patients in Africa who have contracted Ebola have died. Eight of the nine Ebola patients who have been treated in the United States have survived. That's primarily because, U.S. officials say, there are far greater resources and coordination in the United States than in West Africa, both in government response to containing the virus and in medical tools needed to treat it. Hug from the mayor . New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio welcomed Spencer back to his ""normal life."" Spencer stood beside the mayor. De Blasio urged him to give the mayor's wife a hug. Then, de Blasio and Spencer embraced. It's a ""good feeling to hug a hero,"" de Blasio said. Spencer had been in isolation at Bellevue since his diagnosis last month. At the time, the 33-year-old had just returned home from Guinea. He came down with symptoms shortly after arriving in New York on October 17. He was diagnosed on October 23 -- the same day that Doctors Without Borders reported that he had a fever. Ebola patients must be symptomatic to be contagious. Reports that he went jogging and bowling, ate out and took the subway fanned fears that the virus could spread in the city. But authorities said that the risk of that happening was low. New York authorities said there were strict protocols in place to handle an Ebola patient and to track those with whom he or she came into contact. Dr. Laura Evans was part of Spencer's treatment team at Bellevue. She said that when she was first called to help, she assumed that she was responding to one of the many Ebola drills that the medical staff had been practicing. She was shocked when she found out it was real -- that New York had its first Ebola patient. She said it was an honor to get to know Spencer. He has courage and dedication, and she was inspired by him, she said. Shortly after the press conference, Spencer went back to his apartment in New York. Ebola in Guinea . The virus made its first appearance in Guinea last December, according to the World Health Organization. Ebola first infected a toddler named Emile Ouamouno. The 2-year-old is considered ""patient zero"" for the outbreak, researchers at The New England Journal of Medicine say. It's not clear how the boy, who lived in a rainforest village in southern Guinea, became infected. Investigators at the WHO said this month that there's reason to hope for Guinea because respected community leaders have gotten leaders in 26 villages to help them get the word out about how the virus is spread and how to prevent becoming infected. The help of those villages has resulted in a surge of reported cases that were previously concealed, the WHO said. For some time, many in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone believed Ebola was a lie the government made up, among other falsehoods. Learn more fast facts about Ebola .

"A fire near the fuel tanks at Boston Logan International Airport was quickly extinguished Tuesday, but the incident  halted refueling operations and caused flight departure delays. There were no injuries -- save for some serious headaches for some air travelers. The underground airport  fueling system remained shut down Tuesday evening, meaning planes could not be refueled in Boston. The fire near the ""Fuel Farm"" broke out at about 5 p.m. and was under control within a half hour, according to the Massachusetts Port Authority, which operates the airport. Ed Freni, director of aviation at Logan, told  CNN that 15% of departing flights were delayed or canceled, and that 75% of flights departing after the fire had to schedule a fuel stop at another airport. Freni says a handful of long-haul international flights are stranded in Boston tonight. The airport did not know when repairs would be completed.

"Yahoo's decision to curtail remote working among its employees has stirred dismay in the technology industry at a time when many companies are innovating new solutions to enable telecommuting.

The announcement comes as many governments worldwide are urging employers to consider telecommuting as way of alleviating overburdened and environmentally detrimental transport systems and also striking better work/life balances. Advances in technology, particularly the spread of broadband internet connections and 3G and 4G mobile phone networks has made this possible. At the Mobile World Congress event, many exhibitors stake their futures on an increase in telecommuting. Greg Sullivan, Senior Product Manager for Windows Phone, said remote working provided a tremendous opportunity for workers to get more out of their lives while reducing their impact on the planet's ecosystem. ""We have to be vigilant in making sure that technology doesn't let work overtake us. But one of things that's been enabled by this, is the ability to have it all,"" he told CNN, illustrating his point with an anecdote about being called by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. ""I was at my daughter's soccer game not long ago and I was waiting for a very important e-mail from a very important person at Microsoft -- named Steve -- and I didn't have to stay home and wait for it. ""I could go to my daughter's soccer game and see on my phone that the e-mail came in. So it was a win-win situation and that's what technology can do for us. ""Balmer was probably fine with that - he probably didn't even know that I was at my daughter's soccer game."" One MWC exhibitor GENBAND, a U.S.-based company that provides technology which can be used to create remote working environments, said Yahoo's move was understandable, but the problems it faces could be overcome with better technology. ""There is some validity to the arguments motivating Yahoo's move away from supporting remote workers,"" said GENBAND Chief Executive Charlie Vogt. ""Worker productivity is in some ways a measure of meaningful human interaction and face-to-face communications."" But, he said, communication systems, including video conferencing and internet collaboration, that allow employees to realistically simulate face-to-face interaction, are already on the market. ""With little effort most remote employees can take advantage of intelligent communications tools to elegantly blend the benefits of being part of a vibrant office environment and having the flexibility that comes from working outside the office on a permanent or part-time basis."" Cisco, another MWC exhibitor whose products are directly aimed at creating remote working environments, insisted its technology was capable of recreating every aspect of real-life interaction short of physical contact. Marc Musgrove, Cisco's global communications director, said Yahoo's announcement was unfortunately timed as it came just days ahead of the March 4 start of the third annual Telework Week, a Cisco-backed global initiative to encourage remote working. Musgrove said Cisco's video-link products allowed employees to talk lag-free in high definition, but he said there was a need to strike a balance between ""appropriate"" home working and office-based interaction in genuinely collaborative work spaces such as Cisco's main campus in San Jose, California. ""When people come into the office you don't want people just sitting there heads down knocking out their emails, because they can do that from a café or a home office or remote office."" Foursquare Co-Founder Dennis Crowley also emphasized the need for balance: ""It is great to offer employees the flexibility that If they need to be off for a day or so, or for an afternoon, that's totally fine. ""We try to get as many people together in the office as possible because that's where stuff gets done. People hang out in the lunch room, and they hang out in the hallways and in different meeting rooms. You are more productive when people are all together, but I think you need to have a little bit of flexibility. ""We use things like Google+ Hangouts to do a lot of video conferencing at Foursquare, so we're able to make it work. ""It's a mixture of both, but not too much out of the office,"" he added. David Marcus, President of PayPal, said: ""This is not a black and white answer. Generally if teams are together they're definitely more efficient and more productive. But that being said, you also need to cater to moms who need to go and pick up their kids from school. And so you need to find the right balance.""","Exhibitors at annual Mobile World Congress say Yahoo's ban on remote working ignores need for balance .

"Azwan Elias arrived in America this summer filled with excitement and eagerness to learn. Everyone who knows him says he is wise beyond his 17 years, that he is destined to lead others in his restive homeland of Iraq. He set foot on U.S. soil for the first time in June, part of a group of young Iraqis chosen for a State Department-sponsored leadership program. But the hopes in his heart vanished as fast as they had blossomed. He was forced to watch from afar as militants from ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, pressed into northern Iraq, steamrolling Mosul, the nation's second largest city, and then chunks of Ninevah province. Azwan's family feared for their lives in Bozan, a Yazidi village on the arid plains of Ninevah that's about 30 miles from Mosul. They had lived there all their lives in a modest home built by Azwan's grandfather. Azwan's father worked as a veterinarian once and owned a small farm with a garden and grazing cows and sheep. As a child, Azwan played with his five brothers and sisters and his cousins in the garden. They rode tricycles along a paved driveway and cooled off in Iraq's blistering blaze by soaking in a small, portable pool. On special holidays, they walked up a mountain that rose to the sky above their village for a family picnic. Occasionally, they visited Lalish, the main holy site for Yazidis. Azwan remembers going twice to the temple, squeezed into a crevice between two mountains and just a short drive from Bozan. Azwan, the oldest boy in the family, was a serious student. His father encouraged his education and had sent him to the Kurdish city of Irbil to study at The Kingery Institute for English and Computing, run by an American. There, he began working with another American, Brad Blauser, whose charity delivers wheelchairs to Iraqi children with disabilities. Everyone held high expectations that Azwan would succeed. One day, the family would break from the cycle that kept them bound to an impoverished village. But now they were on the run. Their community was facing extermination. And Azwan, whose drive to help others had led him to America, watched from afar, unable to help even his own family. ISIS fighters were turning their rage on anyone who refused to succumb to their radical Sunni tenets, including Christians and Yazidis, religious minorities in Iraq. Hundreds of thousands were displaced overnight, according to the regional government. Azwan's family, like many others, fled north to the outskirts of Zakho, a city in Iraq's Kurdistan region on the border with Turkey. If Azwan returned to Iraq, he would have to fly into the airport in Irbil, under the Kurdish regional government. But he would be cut off from his family because the highway to Zakho goes through Mosul and territory under ISIS control. He feared that if ISIS managed to enter Irbil, the first thing it would shut down would be the airport. Then, he would never be able to get out. If he could get permission to stay in America, he would be safe. He might even have a chance at a life he could never dream of in Iraq. But he would be separated from his family, perhaps for a very long time. The plight of his people bore down on Azwan as he attended classes every day with 25 other Iraqi students. He was the only Yazidi in the group. The group traveled to various cities in America and spent a chunk of time in Portland, Oregon. Azwan savored the lush greenery of the Pacific Northwest and the wildly different taste of Mexican food. But his mind raced across continents and an ocean to the starkly arid, undulating landscape of northern Iraq. Life-and-death decisions . Azwan was only 13 when he left home in Bozan to study in Irbil. He loved school but hated that his geography books contained no pictures or illustrations. He looked forward to enrolling at the Kingery Institute, opened in 2008 by American doctor and missionary Paul Kingery. Kingery remembers the first time he saw Azwan --  slight and so shy that for months he left the room every time Kingery entered. Over time, he relaxed and picked up Americanisms, though Kingery said Azwan remained true to his Yazidi roots: respectful, quick to help elders and hypervigilant about visitors of all religions and ethnic groups who came to the institute. Eventually, Azwan grew to help manage the institute and assisted Blauser, the former civilian contractor in Iraq who ran Wheelchairs for Kids and was nominated as a 2009 CNN Hero. Blauser recalls Azwan's determination to help his fellow villagers. He was smart and enterprising: a kid who thought more about teachers' salaries than about video games. Azwan found the work rewarding. The stigma attached to disabilities is so high in Iraq that Azwan grew up not knowing his neighbor had two children who needed wheelchairs. They had hidden their secret well. But times were getting tough for the Yazidis, long persecuted in Iraq for their religious beliefs. Yazidis are one of the world's oldest and smallest monotheistic religious minorities. Their ancient religion predates Islam by thousands of years and has links to Zoroastrianism. They venerate Lucifer as a redeemed archangel, which is why Muslims view them -- mistakenly -- as devil worshipers. Islamic militant attacks on the Yazidis in Iraq are based on this centuries-old loathing. Even before ISIS arrived, Azwan's family lived under constant fear that Sunni militants in Mosul would attack Yazidis, as they had been known to do in the past. One time, they stopped a school bus, yanked all the Yazidi children out and shot them dead. But ""Yazidi"" was not in America's vocabulary until in recent weeks when militant Islam's wrath threatened to wipe out an entire people in Iraq. ISIS slaughtered more than 500 Yazidis, burying some of them alive. They captured women as slaves, ordered conversions to Islam and laid siege to Mount Sinjar, trapping 50,000 Yazidi people atop without food and water. Azwan's father, Assad Elias, decided it was not safe for the family to remain in Bozan, so they fled to Zakho. Azwan's sister sent him photographs on her cell phone from the Turkish border. Azwan told me it was hard to look at those images. He knew his loved ones, displaced from their home, were huddled together in a small room, struggling to survive. He also knew his father was not telling him everything. I called his father to learn more about their situation. ""Please say hello to Azwan,"" Assad Elias told me, the fatigue apparent in his voice. ""Don't tell him about our condition. I don't want him to worry."" He also said he doesn't want Azwan to return to Iraq. ""We, Yazidis, are treated like third-class citizens,"" Elias said. ""Everywhere is filled with refugees. ISIS -- they hate non-Muslims who are not radicals. We and the Christians are vulnerable now to eradication."" Azwan, he said, should make a new life in America and hold onto one belief: one day the family will be reunited. His father worries because no one in the family has a passport. Getting one would have meant a trip to Mosul, and for the last decade he has feared entering the Sunni-dominated city that has been a hotbed of insurgent activity since the ouster of Saddam Hussein in 2003. Without passports, the Elias family cannot cross the Turkish border. Once a proud farmer and veterinarian, Assad Elias feels like a caged bird. Life centers every day now on one thing: staying alive. An uncomfortable silence followed. Then Elias' voice strengthened. ""Thank you,"" he said, ""to good people everywhere. I wish only for peace in the world."" In America, Azwan worried about what would happen if ISIS pushed northward. How would his loved ones escape? He feared they would be trapped and slaughtered like animals. ""My family -- they are scared,"" he said. ""They don't know what's going to happen."" He knew he was facing decisions that no one his age should have to make. A chance at life free of fear . Last week, the visiting Iraqi students in the State Department's youth development program visited the White House and met with Vice President Joe Biden even as President Barack Obama was dealing with the myriad problems in Iraq. It was the last outing for the Iraqi students. The leadership program was nearing an end. Time was running out for Azwan.He knew he could potentially face death if he returned to Iraq. The young Iraqis boarded a plane to carry them back to their troubled land, their future prospects seemingly bleaker by the day. They took off with the horrific ISIS killing of American journalist James Foley in the headlines. They took off without Azwan. He stayed back with Bertwin Lord, a Washington-based international business consultant who knows Blauser and met Azwan at Kingery's school in Irbil. The three Americans had kept in touch with Azwan during his stay in the United States and stepped up to help him. Lord said Azwan's father gave him permission to act as a guardian for Azwan until he turns 18 next month. Lord then filed a petition for Azwan to obtain asylum in the United States. Lord believes the current persecution of the Yazidis is more than enough reason to grant asylum. It ought to be an open and shut case, he said. The petition is pending. ""He's a good kid,"" Lord said. ""I know him. He deserves this."" Azwan said he is ready to finish schooling here and launch his American dream, even though he has no way of knowing when he will see his parents and siblings again. But he feels lucky. Amid a real threat of extermination of his people, Azwan knows he is getting a chance to flourish.

"An early and severe start to the flu season has many health experts concerned. On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 47 states are experiencing widespread activity, although it appears to be decreasing in some areas. According to the CDC, this is the most flu cases they've seen at this time of year in more than a decade. Twenty pediatric flu-related deaths have occurred since the start of the season. The CDC does not track adult flu-related deaths. The peak of the season, which usually happens in February, may be yet to come for most states -- officials said Friday it may be a week or two before it becomes clear whether cases have peaked. Here are some common flu questions from readers answered: . Why is this year's flu causing more severe cases? The type of flu that is going around is called Influenza A (H3N2), which is often linked to more serious diseases than other flu varieties, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, told CNN. People could get more complications from this particular strain, which would make them sick for a longer period of time. How is this flu season different than last year's? The 2011-2012 flu season began late and was relatively mild compared with previous seasons, according to the CDC. In fact, the season's peak set a record for the lowest and shortest since surveillance began. The number of pediatric flu-related deaths was also low last year. The CDC reported 26 children under the age of 18 had died by May 25, 2012. As a comparison, 122 pediatric flu-related deaths were reported during the 2010-2011 season. How many people usually die from the flu each year? The flu kills about 36,000 people a year in the United States, according to the CDC, though the range varies greatly each year. Most deaths are caused by complications from the flu. Children under 2 years old, adults over 65, pregnant women and American Indians are at a greater risk of suffering from flu complications, according to the CDC. People with medical conditions like asthma, lung disease, heart disease and people with weakened immune systems are also at risk. How does someone go from having the flu to dying? Most of the people who die have underlying illnesses or a weakened immune system, says Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. The flu can weaken the immune system even more, which can lead to a complication like a bacterial infection. ""It is that bacterial infection that most often causes death, especially in the younger population,"" Gupta says. So if I get the flu, should I go to the emergency room? Most people with the flu don't have to -- they'll recover on their own in five to seven days with plenty of rest and fluids, says Dr. David Zich, internal medicine and emergency medicine physician at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. However, you should go to the ER immediately if: . -- You have difficulty breathing or have pain in your chest . -- You can't keep fluids down because of nausea and vomiting . -- Your fever or cough gets better, then worsens . ""Let's say you have the flu, you get better, you think everything is all clear,"" Gupta says. ""Then a couple days later, the fever comes back. That means you may now have a bacterial infection."" Does this mean the flu vaccine isn't working? The flu vaccine is only about 60% effective, according to the CDC. How well the vaccine works can vary based on your age and health, as well as how good the ""match"" of the vaccine is to this year's flu strain. Each year, the vaccine is made from three strains of the influenza virus that researchers suspect will be the most active. So far, according to the CDC, this year's vaccine matches well with the most predominant type of flu spreading in the United States, but is less well matched to the No. 2 type of virus. The vaccine usually works best in young, healthy people, according to Dr. Bill Schaffner, chairman of the preventative medicine department at Vanderbilt University. But even if you do get the flu, the vaccine can protect against harsher complications. Learn more about the flu vaccine's effectiveness . Will the flu vaccine make me sick? The virus used in the flu shot is a dead virus, Gupta says. ""You cannot get the flu from a flu shot."" But your body's immune system will react, and that can make you feel pain in your arm or feel less than 100% for a few days. Is there a flu vaccine shortage? While CNN has heard reports of vaccine shortages in some areas, manufacturers say there are vaccines available for anyone who wants to get a flu shot. There was a temporary delay in new shipments of the antiviral medicine Tamiflu due to an increased demand, according to a spokeswoman. Tamiflu can help reduce the severity and length of flu symptoms if taken early. Learn more about the reported shortages . I'm sold! Is it too late to get the vaccine? In one word: no. Keep in mind that it takes about two weeks for antibodies to develop in your body and provide protection against the virus, the CDC says. Opinion: Next time, get the vaccine early . How can I avoid getting the flu in the first place? It's disturbing to think about, but flu germs can spread up to 6 feet through coughs and sneezes. They can also live on surfaces for up to eight hours. Dr. Jennifer Shu, a pediatrician and mother of two, recommends practicing good ""social distancing."" This means canceling parties or dates if someone is sick and avoiding large crowds (like at the movies or going out to dinner) if your community has been hit hard by the virus. It's also a good idea to practice proper hand-washing -- for at least 20 seconds several times a day. And wiping handles, counters and remotes daily with hot soapy water or disinfectant will kill any germs that linger.

"(CNN) -- ""Obviously, first of all, this conversation never took place. ... OK?"" Financier Bernard Madoff is serving a 150-year prison term for defrauding thousands of investors. So began a phone call in which convicted swindler Bernard Madoff told colleagues how to dance around questions from the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to an audiotape and transcript released Wednesday by the Massachusetts secretary of state's office. ""You know, you don't have to be too brilliant with these guys, because you don't have to be,"" Madoff said, referring to SEC investigators. Authorities continue to unravel the far-reaching Ponzi scheme masterminded by Madoff that bankrupted some once-wealthy investors and forced many nonprofit groups and foundations to shut down or make drastic cuts. At one point, Madoff interrupted the conversation to take another phone call. He returned and said, ""I'm sorry. If I get any more solicitations for charity, I'm going to kill myself.""  Watch what else Madoff said » . Madoff, 71, was convicted of operating a Ponzi scheme and defrauding thousands of investors. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 150 years in prison in June. Prosecutors have said it was the largest investor fraud ever committed by a single person, totaling more than $50 billion in losses to investors. Amit Vijayvergiya, chief risk officer of the Fairfield Greenwich Group, was included in the taped phone call. It wasn't immediately clear when the call was made. Fairfield Greenwich Group reached an $8 million settlement this week with the Massachusetts Securities Division in connection with the Madoff scandal. State regulators sued Fairfield for misleading investors and acting as a feeder fund to Madoff's Ponzi scheme. With the settlement, Massachusetts dropped fraud charges against the company. Thursday, representatives for the Fairfield Greenwich Group released a statement noting that the company asked the SEC for permission to speak to Madoff ahead of an SEC interview. ""Madoff's much-quoted line -- 'Obviously, first of all, this conversation never took place' -- was completely ignored by Fairfield Greenwich,"" the statement said. ""Rather than take Madoff's suggestion to conceal the call, Fairfield Greenwich executives did the opposite. They told the SEC about the call and answered all questions accurately."" ""Any implication that the Madoff call affected Fairfield's responses to the SEC is demonstrably false,"" the statement added. ""There is no suggestion or allegation that anyone at Fairfield Greenwich tried to mislead the SEC."" In the phone call, Madoff cautioned his Fairfield associates not to know too much about how he was handling investments. ""You don't want to have that information because ... the commission, when they ask questions, they try and draw out information,"" Madoff said. ""The less that you know how we execute ... the better you are."" Before running out of money in December, Madoff sent statements to victims, claiming that their investments had grown several times over. In actuality, he had stolen, not invested, their money. Investigators said they think he had run the scam since at least the 1980s. In the phone conversation with Fairfield, Madoff said he called the shots at his company. ""I'm the only one that can make the decision. ... I'm the only one that pulls the trigger."" Madoff advised taking a casual approach in dealing with the SEC. He said, if asked, Fairfield executives should minimize the ties between the companies and not volunteer answers. ""They ask you a zillion different questions, and we look at them sometimes and we laugh, and we say, 'Are you guys writing a book?'

"President Barack Obama has said that Russian President Vladimir Putin has violated international law by sending troops into the Crimea.  Law is on Obama's side, which is why Putin is organizing his justification counter-offensive. The United Nations charter (article 2(4)) prohibits ""the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations."" Ukrainian lawyers have said there are additional treaties Putin is violating. Putin's forces were apparently concerned enough about the U.N prohibition to strip the identifying markers off Russian soldiers before sending them into Crimea, and to now call these troops ""local defense forces."" But removing their insignias does not change the facts. Putin's new tactic is to claim that Russia has been invited in. It is illegal to invade another country, but not illegal to send in help when a legitimate government requests it. Putin has asserted that Ukraine's ousted president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, remains the Ukraine's legitimate president, and he has asked for help. Putin may also be behind the influx of protest tourists to Ukraine who pretend they are Ukrainians asking for Russian help. Opinion: Putin's Ukrainian endgame . There is a long and storied tradition of governments inventing a legal premise to justify their actions.  During the Cold War, President Reagan justified U.S. intervention in Grenada as necessary to protect Americans living on the island.  Reagan also defended U.S. military support in Nicaragua as collective self-defense requested by El Salvador. These claims were just as credible as Putin's claims, which is to say: not very. Putin cares little whether his actions violate international law. But the Europeans and Americans who will organize a response do care, and ordinary Russians may also care, which is why Putin is working to create the appearance of legal intervention. While only the U.N. Security Council (where Russia holds veto power) can authorize a collective response to Russian aggression, the legal principle of ""responsibility to protect"" allows individual states and groups of states to legally justify their response to illegal acts of aggression. Where might all this lead? The answer depends on who ends up ruling Ukraine. And this is the point. Each side is now wooing its future dance partner: Americans and Europeans are wooing Ukraine's pro-Western political forces, and Putin is stirring fears of ethnic Russians and seeking support for a pro-Russian government. An anti-Putin Ukrainian government could try to bring a case to the International Court of Justice over the illegal use of force in Russia's incursion into Crimea. This is the strategy Georgian leaders tried after Russia's last foreign intervention, but the effort failed. Since Russia does not accept the International Court of Justice's general jurisdiction, Georgia instead charged Russia with the illegal use of force, and with violating the International Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination, which Russia has ratified. The ICJ rejected jurisdiction in the case, however, because without Russia's preconsent the ICJ could not decide claims about illegal force. For the racial discrimination convention, Georgia would have to first try to negotiate with Russia over its disagreements.  Any Ukrainian government would find itself similarly hampered. Imagine that an anti-Russian Ukrainian government gained power and actually won its legal suit.  Then what?  In the best-case scenario, Ukraine would win a legal declaration on its side, which might make Russia liable to compensate Ukraine for its losses.  Russia could then refuse to comply, or it could do what the United States did to settle the illegal use of force suit that Nicaragua won in front of the ICJ. Russia could require that Ukraine relinquish its claim if it wants to receive its aid package. And Ukraine would have few options, since ICJ rulings can only be enforced by the Security Council (again, on which Russia holds veto power). Opinion: How Putin carries out power grab . A more likely scenario is that the issue will never get this far.  Even if an anti-Putin government wins the upcoming election, Ukraine is still too dependent on Russian energy to antagonize it by bringing a legal suit that will achieve so little. The International Criminal Court is not likely to become involved, in any event, since neither Russia nor Ukraine have ratified the Rome Statute, which would give the International Criminal Court the right to claim jurisdiction over the case. Nor would the Security Council refer the matter to the court. The reality is that international law has little to offer right now. This will only be the case, however, as long as Russia does not engage in mass atrocities; these would change the political calculus . Human rights violations can be pursued by Ukraine's new government, or by individuals raising legal claims in front of the European Court of Human Rights, where both Russia and the Ukraine are signatory members. Russia actually has a good record for paying awards ordered by the European Court of Human Rights. At this point, international law's largest contribution may be to channel Russia's response. International law is leading Putin to step back from the more overtly illegal strong-arm tactics associated with sending in troops, and he knows that any mass atrocities would provoke a more serious international response. International law won't stop an invasion, and in light of the events in Syria, odds are that neither side wants to escalate to the point of mass atrocities.  So international law stands ready on the sidelines, a tool of both sides to justify their actions.","Karen Alter: Obama says Putin violated international law; Putin wants to make it look otherwise .

"Shannon Maureen Conley's plan to join ISIS and serve as a nurse at a jihadist camp ended Wednesday with a guilty plea to a terror charge in a Colorado federal court. Conley, 19, was arrested at Denver International Airport in April as she was about to embark on a journey to Germany and eventually to an ISIS camp near the Turkish border. She told investigators that she was going to Turkey to await word from her suitor, identified in court documents as Yousr Mouelhi, an ISIS member she met on the Internet, whom she planned to marry. Conley, a convert to Islam who wore a blue and white striped jail uniform and a traditional Muslim headscarf, appeared before a federal judge Wednesday and pleaded guilty to charge of conspiracy to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization. A certified nurse aide, Conley faces a maximum penalty of five years in federal prison and up to a $250,000 fine. U.S. District Judge Raymond Moore set sentencing for January 23 and ordered that she have a psychiatric evaluation. As part of the plea agreement, Conley must provide law enforcement agencies with information about others looking to help terrorist organizations abroad. In a statement after the plea, Conley's federal defender Robert Pepin referred to his client as Halima Shannon Conley. ""She's also a 19-year-old woman of faith who was pursuing her faith and, unfortunately, as she pursued it she was led terribly astray,"" the statement said. ""That, in turn, led her to make some poor choices and she is now paying the price of those choices."" Since her arrest, Pepin said, ""the news out of the part of the world to which she was headed has been just awful."" ""Like all of us, Halima has been horrified to learn of the slaughter and oppression at the hands of the people controlling ISIS,"" Pepin said in the statement. ""It was never her vision to have any role in any of that. She would like everyone to know that her heart ... and her prayers go out to ... the families of those who have been killed, and to anyone who has been oppressed by those forces. Finally, Halima is fully aware that the fact that she was arrested may have very well saved her."" Conley may not be the only American fighting alongside ISIS. More than 100 Americans have tried to join various militant groups in Syria, U.S. officials say. While some are aligned with ISIS, the fighters shift allegiance and it's difficult to pin down a specific number, officials say. Douglas McAuthur McCain, a 33-year-old reared in Minnesota, died in a battle between rival extremist groups in the suburbs of Aleppo, Syria's largest city, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based group that monitors the conflict. Attorney General Eric Holder estimated this summer that there are 7,000 foreign fighters in the war-ravaged Middle Eastern nation. McCain was not the first of these American militants to die in Syria. Islamists touted the role of a 22-year-old man -- identified by State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki as Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha, who grew up and went to school in Florida -- in a northern Syria suicide bombing conducted in coordination with al-Nusra Front earlier this year. In Colorado, Conley allegedly told FBI agents that she was going to be with a member of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, that she had met online. She told federal agents she had read a book called ""Al-Qaida's Doctrine for Insurgency"" and intended to wage jihad against the United States, according to the criminal complaint. When she was arrested, Conley had in her possession certification papers for first aid and nursing, the U.S. Army Explorers and the National Rifle Association, according to court documents. ""It's a difficult time for us,"" her mother, Ana Conley, told CNN last month, when court documents in the case were unsealed. According to court papers, Conley's parents were aware she had converted to Islam, but did not know about her interest in violent jihad. Her father, John, reportedly caught Shannon talking to her suitor, described as a  32-year-old Tunisian man, on Skype. Man arrested after overseas trip, accused of sympathizing with ISIS . The couple asked for the father's blessing and he refused, the court papers said. On April 1, John called FBI to report he had found plane ticket for later that month to Turkey. Her daughter was arrested on a jetway while trying to board a flight to Germany on April 8, according to a criminal complaint. California man arrested, said he wanted to join ISIS . Conley first came to the attention of authorities after the pastor and the security director at a church in Arvada, Colorado, called police and said she was acting suspiciously. Authorities interviewed her seven times over the course of five months before arresting her at the airport. ""I think she realizes she made a terrible mistake,"" her mother told CNN. ""She was clueless. She's just a teenager, young, with a big mouth.""

"Chiara de Blasio, daughter of New York City Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio, has struggled with clinical depression and drug abuse, the 19-year-old revealed in a YouTube video posted Christmas Eve. ""I've had depression, like clinical depression, for my entire adolescence,"" de Blasio says in the video. ""It made it easier, the more I drank and did drugs, to share some common ground with people that I wouldn't have. It didn't start out as a huge thing for me but then it became a really huge thing for me."" In the video, de Blasio speaks about drinking and smoking marijuana when she was in college, as well as the outpatient treatment that started her on the road to recovery. De Blasio's father sailed to a landslide victory last month over Republican candidate Joe Lhota to become New York's first Democratic mayor in more than 20 years. One key to his victory was a connection with voters, formed in part via his mixed-race family, particularly his son, Dante, and wife, Chirlane McCray, who played a prominent role on the campaign trail. Chiara's story has until now stayed out of the public eye. ""As parents, our instinct has been to protect our daughter and privately help her through a deeply personal struggle,"" her parents said in an e-mail to supporters that linked to the video. ""But not only has Chiara committed to her own health, she is also committed to helping young people everywhere who face similar challenges."" Professionally shot and edited, the YouTube video was released under an account bearing Chiara de Blasio's name. It directs viewers to visit ok2talk.org, an organization that encourages youth who struggle with mental illness to talk about their experiences. According to the video, Chiara de Blasio has completed treatment and is now trying to reach out to others. ""It's just important for people to realize, anybody who is watching this, that if you're suffering and if you're depressed, you're dealing with mental illness, and you think that it might have something to do with your drug abuse or drinking, or if you're just suffering from both of those at the same time and you think that they're completely unrelated to one another,"" she says, ""getting sober is always a positive thing."" De Blasio makes minimal reference to her parents, not naming either and mentioning only that both were ""very emotionally committed to try to figure out some way to get me better."" Participating in her father's campaign after completing treatment ""was like the greatest thing ever,"" de Blasio says, although she doesn't specify that it was the mayoral race. White House Drug Policy Director Gil Kerlikowske issued a statement Tuesday afternoon praising the young de Blasio for speaking out. ""Chiara is giving a voice to the millions who suffer from substance use and mental health disorders, and we encourage others to join her,"" he said. ""By talking about addiction in the light of day -- and by celebrating recovery out loud -- we can help correct the misinformation and stigma that too often become obstacles for the millions of Americans who deserve to live healthy, productive lives,"" Kerlikowske said. De Blasio decided to speak out ""because people are suffering from this disease and dying from this disease every day. And we really can't do anything as a society to help those people until we start talking about it,"" she says. ""And nobody can do sobriety on their own.""","Chiara de Blasio says on YouTube she's struggled with depression, drinking, marijuana .

"A Senate committee's approval of a resolution authorizing military force against Syria gave some momentum to President Barack Obama's effort to win overall congressional support for the effort, but conference calls involving members of his own party indicate that it's still an uphill battle in the House. With Obama in Sweden and Russia trying in part to rally global backing to punish Syria for its alleged use of chemical weapons, his chief of staff briefed two Democratic blocs -- the solidly anti-war liberal Congressional Progressive Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Several members who participated in the calls indicated the administration still has a lot of work to do. ""If I had to vote today, I would vote no,"" Missouri Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver told CNN. Cleaver noted he had multiple concerns before Wednesday's call, which occurred on the same day the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved a resolution authorizing a limited military strike on Syria. The administration says there is overwhelming evidence that Bashar al-Assad's regime killed more than 1,400 people in a chemical weapons attack earlier this month outside Damascus, violating global conventions against their use, further escalating a two-year civil war, and putting civilians and allies in the region at new risk. A key question . Cleaver didn't dispute the evidence, but asked a question that others have posed over the past two weeks. ""What is the U.S. position -- do we react militarily when people get murdered with sarin gas?  Do we respond when people are slaughtered in Darfur when sarin is not used?"" he said. Cleaver, the former head of the Congressional Black Caucus, said he's willing to listen to a classified explanation, but the case hasn't been made yet. ""What form of slaughter is more repugnant?"" he asked. The Congressional Black Caucus is scheduled to meet with National Security Adviser Susan Rice in a closed meeting on Monday, a caucus spokeswoman said. No doubt, Cleaver will hear from constituents on the issue when he holds a town hall meeting at home in Kansas City on Thursday evening. Although Obama has appealed to congress to act for the good of humanity, polls show that most Americans surveyed do not want the United States to intervene in the Syrian conflict, which the United Nations estimates has claimed more than 100,000 lives. The administration, working with Congress, has said it is planning for a limited strike, which experts believe would involve cruise missiles. Senior officials have said there are no plans to involve American combat troops, a restriction reinforced by the Foreign Relations Committee resolution that has yet to be considered by the full chamber. Another Democrat who listened to the call, Illinois Rep. Jan Schakowsky, also agreed that the evidence was convincing that the al-Assad regime used weapons against its own people. But in a statement to CNN after the call Schakowsky, who sits on the intelligence committee, said the information so far was helpful but not sufficient. ""As much as I need to consider the scope and duration of any attack, I have many questions about its efficacy,"" Schakowsky said. ""I want to know to know what evidence the administration can provide that this strike will denigrate the Assad regime's ability to use these weapons again, what plans have been made for possible retaliation and a clear sense of the end game."" The Republican battle over Syria . Iraq a factor . The U.S. experience in the protracted and costly Iraq war weighs heavily on House Democrats, and many are pushing to include specific limitations on the length and scope of any military mission. Many members of Congress also remember the faulty intelligence that underpinned the U.S. rationale for invading Iraq a decade ago. One senior Democratic aide who participated in the White House call with Hispanic members said there remains a broad spectrum of questions about the need for military action against Syria. But ""for those that are on the fence the resolution has to be as limited and tailored as possible before they will vote for it,"" the aide said. Senior House Democratic aides cautioned that it's still premature to gauge the votes, and said the vast majority of House Democrats are still undecided and asking for more information. A steady stream of rank and file House Republicans have announced their opposition to a resolution, with House Speaker John Boehner expressing support for a strike but making it clear it's up to the White House to secure the votes. The pressure is on for Democratic leaders to convince a significant chunk of war weary House Democrats to back the president. Even within top Democratic leadership ranks there are divisions. Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer support the president, and are in close contact with the White House. But the No. 3 leader, Rep. Jim Clyburn is not aboard yet. ""Issues of war & peace require thoughtful consideration.  I reserve judgment on Syria until a resolution and more details are forthcoming,"" Clyburn said in a statement released via Twitter. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra, however, is now saying he is prepared to vote 'yes' if the military response is limited. While Pelosi and Hoyer aren't formally putting pressure on members, they are soliciting input on the language members could support for a resolution. For the second time in two days, Pelosi sent a letter to House Democrats urging them to attend classified briefings and review the report laying out the evidence on the use of chemical weapons. Pelosi was asked by TIME on Tuesday if she thought she could bring her caucus into the 'aye' column. ""I don't know. I think it would be important to get a majority in the Congress. But I don't know if it's important how you would break it down. These issues are not really partisan,"" she said. Cleaver was reluctant to characterize the breadth of opposition among his colleagues. ""There is a great amount of skepticism floating over the Capitol,"" he said. More classified briefings . Cleaver added that the support among party leaders in Congress for a military response is unlikely to sway fellow House Democrats. Two more classified briefings with administration officials are scheduled for Thursday and Friday. But most members are still out of town for the congressional recess and will not have a chance to review the evidence until another closed session set for Monday evening, the first day Congress is officially back at work. But the issue has many Democrats mindful of what's at stake if they oppose their president. Cleaver said he was ""invested in the success of President Barack Obama"" and wanted history to judge his presidency ""more positively than negatively."" Schakowsky also referenced history as she wrestles with her vote. ""As a Jew, I am mindful how the world stood by when millions of Jewish people were gassed to death and feel an obligation to oppose such actions,"" she said. ""The question remains what's the most effective way to make clear to the world that the U.S. will stand against such atrocities."" How will Senate vote? How will House vote?","Many in president's own party in House undecided or skeptical of Syria military action .
Anti-war liberals present especially tough challenge for administration in lobbying effort .

"Washington (CNN) -- A commission set up to assess national security measures on Tuesday gave the U.S. government a failing grade in improving response time to a biological attack. ""Nearly a decade after September 11, 2001, one year after our original report, and one month after the Christmas Day bombing attempt, the United States is failing to address several urgent threats, especially bioterrorism,"" said former Sen. Bob Graham, chairman of the commission. ""Each of the last three administrations has been slow to recognize and respond to the biothreat. But we no longer have the luxury of a slow learning curve, when we know al Qaeda is interested in bioweapons,"" Graham said. ""The assessment is not a good one, particularly in the area of biological threats,"" the report by the Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism said. ""While the government has made progress on preventing such attacks, it is simply not paying consistent and urgent attention to the means of responding quickly and effectively so that they no longer constitute a threat of mass destruction,"" the report said. The government barely got a passing grade on oversight of high-containment laboratories. The commission, headed by Graham, a former Democratic senator from Florida, and Jim Talent, R-Missouri, also gave the government failing grades in congressional oversight and in producing the next generation of security experts. Read the report card (PDF) The delayed response to the H1N1 influenza outbreak demonstrated the United States was ""woefully behind"" in its ability to produce needed vaccinations and treatments rapidly, the commission said. ""H1N1 came with months of warning,"" the commission's report said. ""But even with time to prepare, the epidemic peaked before most Americans had access to vaccine. A bioattack will come with no such warning."" The commission was set up after Congress passed a bill in 2007 to implement recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. The commission submitted its report with new recommendations in December 2008, predicting that terrorists would use a weapon of mass destruction -- likely biological -- by 2013 unless the global community quickly launched a forceful strategy to prevent it. The report card released Tuesday is a follow-up to that report, called ""World at Risk."" Congress took its lumps in the report as well, especially on its oversight of national security issues. ""Congress has failed to take even the relatively easy first steps to consolidate oversight authority of the Department of Homeland Security,"" the commission said. ""The estimated number of committees and subcommittees that oversee DHS ranges from 82 to 108. Virtually no progress has been made since consolidation was first recommended by the 9/11 Commission in 2004."" Both Congress and the administration were faulted for not funding recruitment and training programs for national security experts. The government got an ""incomplete"" for its work on implementing a comprehensive nuclear policy toward Pakistan -- meaning that not enough time had elapsed to give a grade. Other areas in nuclear proliferation, including working with Russia, got middle-of-the-road grades. ""President Obama has undertaken substantial effort to bolster the nonproliferation regime,"" the commission said. ""From his April 2009 speech in Prague to his chairmanship of a United Nations Security Council meeting on the subject and plans for a Global Summit on Nuclear Security, he is attempting to bend current trend lines."" But the commission said that it has concerns ""regarding the administration's failure to prevent the lapse of verification mechanisms established under the [Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty]. Ensuring their continuation was very important and insufficient attention was paid to it."" The commission handed out ""A"" grades for integration of the National Security and Homeland Security councils, designation of a senior adviser for WMD proliferation and terrorism, and development of a national strategy for bioforensics.","Nation ill-prepared for biological attack, commission report says .

"Two teenage boys are being hailed as heroes after they chased a car carrying a kidnapped girl -- on their bicycles. Five-year-old Jocelyn Rojas was playing in her front yard in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, when she vanished Thursday afternoon. Authorities believe she was abducted by a man who lured her by offering ice cream. For two hours, neighbors and police scoured the area and asked if anyone had seen her. Temar Boggs, 15, and his friend took off on their bicycles to search. About a half-mile away, they spotted Jocelyn in a sedan. But the driver was elusive. ""Every time we'd go down the street, he'd turn back around, and then ... we'll follow him,"" Temar told CNN affiliate WGAL. The two teens chased the alleged kidnapper on their bikes for 15 heart-pounding minutes. The driver apparently knew he was being followed and gave up. ""He stopped at the end of the hill and let her out, and she ran to me and said that she needed her mom,"" Temar said. Jocelyn's relatives and neighbors took turns hugging Temar. ""He's our hero. There is just no words to say,"" Jocelyn's grandmother Tracey Clay said. Police are looking for the suspect, described as a white male between 50 and 70 years old. He was driving a reddish-purple or maroon car with round taillights, WGAL reported. The man was wearing green shoes, green pants and a red-and-white striped shirt. He walked with a limp. Although the suspect remains at large, Temar feels good about finding Jocelyn. ""I just feel like I did something very accomplishing today,"" the teen said. The girl's family couldn't agree more.

"People often ask me what advice I would give the White House about various things. Today I was mulling over election results from New York and Nevada while thinking about that very question. What should the White House do now? One word came to mind: Panic. We are far past sending out talking points. Do not attempt to dumb it down. We cannot stand any more explanations. Have you talked to any Democratic senators lately? I have. It's pretty damn clear they are not happy campers. This is what I would say to President Barack Obama: The time has come to demand a plan of action that requires a complete change from the direction you are headed. I don't know how else to break this down. Simply put: . 1. Fire somebody. No -- fire a lot of people. This may be news to you but this is not going well. For precedent, see Russian Army 64th division at Stalingrad. There were enough deaths at Stalingrad to make the entire tea party collectively orgasm. Mr. President, your hinge of fate must turn. Bill Clinton fired many people in 1994 and took a lot of heat for it. Reagan fired most of his campaign staff in 1980. Republicans historically fired their own speaker, Newt Gingrich. Bush fired Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. For God's sake, why are we still looking at the same political and economic advisers that got us into this mess? It's not working. Furthermore, it's not going to work with the same team, the same strategy and the same excuses. I know economic analysts are smart -- some work 17-hour days. It's time to show them the exit. Wake up -- show us you are doing something. 2. Indict people. There are certain people in American finance who haven't been held responsible for utterly ruining the economic fabric of our country. Demand from the attorney general a clear status of the state of investigation concerning these extraordinary injustices imposed upon the American people. I know Attorney General Eric Holder is a close friend of yours, but if his explanations aren't good, fire him too. Demand answers to why no one has been indicted. Mr. President, people are livid. Tell people that you, too, are angry and sickened by the irresponsible actions on Wall Street that caused so much suffering. Do not accept excuses. Demand action now. 3. Make a case like a Democrat. While we are going along with the Republican austerity garbage, who is making the case against it? It's not the Democrats! We are allowing the over-educated, over-explanatory bureaucrat by the name of (Congresssional Budget Office director Douglas) Elmendorf do all the talking.  Do not let him make your case. Let us make your case. Is it any wonder that we were doing better in the middle of the stimulus-spending period than we are doing with the austerity program? 4. Hold fast to an explanation. Stick to your rationale for what has happened and what is going to happen under your leadership. You must carry this through until the election (never say that things are improving because evidently they are not). As I watch the Republican debates, I realize that we are on the brink of a crazy person running our nation. I sit in front of the television and shudder at the thought of one of these creationism-loving, global-warming-denying, immigration-bashing, Social-Security-cutting, clean-air-hating, mortality-fascinated, Wall-Street-protecting Republicans running my country. The course we are on is not working. The hour is late, and the need is great.  Fire. Indict. Fight.","James Carville: Special elections are a warning to White House .

"Kim Stevens has a problem that affects tens of millions of Americans.  If left untreated, it could lead to the death of someone she loves, someone who's part of the family. Stevens' dog Dodger, a black and gray mixed breed, is obese.  According to a new study, he's emblematic of a growing problem. The majority of adult dogs and cats in U.S. homes are overweight or obese, and the problem has gotten worse over the past year, according to the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention.  Fifty-three percent of adult dogs and 55% of cats were classified as overweight or obese by their veterinarians. ""I didn't notice the weight creeping on -- it was like all of a sudden he was just this fat dog,"" Stevens said as she and Dodger visited Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park. ""His weight is about 82 pounds right now, and he should be 62 pounds.""  That means he needs to lose about a quarter of his weight -- equivalent to a 200-pound person needing to lose 50 pounds. The reason is pretty simple: ""Too much food and not enough exercise,"" Stevens said. iReport: 'There is no stopping this fatty' The Association for Pet Obesity Prevention report shows not only that more pets are overweight, but also that those with the problem ""are getting fatter,""  said Ernie Ward, the group's founder. The annual study, to be released next week and given in advance to CNN, found that 25% of cats and just more than 21% of dogs are obese.  Both those figures are up slightly from 2010. About 41 million dogs and 47 million cats are overweight or obese, the study found. A long list of health dangers comes with the excess weight.  ""It's not a matter of if, it's when"" serious complications will strike, said Ward. These can include high blood pressure, ""crippling arthritis,"" diabetes and some cancers.  ""Their life is shortened by two or 2½ years,"" said Ward, a veterinarian in North Carolina. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Center for Veterinary Medicine, which cites the association's annual study, said the diseases seen among obese pets ""are eerily similar to those reported for people."" A central part of the problem, the pet obesity group found, is the growing ""fat pet gap:"" More and more owners are unaware their pets are overweight.  The study found that 22% of dog owners and 15% of cat owners characterized their pets as normal weight when the animals were actually overweight or obese. ""In simplest terms, we've made fat pets the new normal,"" said Ward. In many cases, the problem correlates to the obesity epidemic among people, he said. ""This is the sentinel for childhood obesity.  When I see dogs who are overweight, I see a child that's at risk for excess weight, because nobody's exercising. The kid's playing video games all day, the dog sits around all day,"" and ""everybody's eating poorly."" Stevens said she needs to shed some weight, too. ""We'll do it together,"" she said. The fact that obesity has struck her dog is particularly telling.  Stevens does some work as a dog trainer.  ""To have a dog this heavy when you know better ... is embarrassing,"" she said. But she has a lot of company.  Thirty-nine percent of U.S. households own at least one dog, and 33% of households own at least one cat, according to the Humane Society of the United States. The pet obesity survey was conducted at 41 veterinary clinics across the country and included evaluations of a sampling of more than 600 animals.  ""Over the five years studied, these results have proven to be consistent and increasing at a gradual pace,"" the association said. While the obvious advice -- eat less, exercise more -- is the right starting point, there's more that pet owners should understand, Ward said. iReport: Dog packs on 60 pounds . Pet foods these days are ""more calorically dense"" than they used to be, yet owners are feeding their pets more, he said. If you're concerned your pet may be obese, it's important to work with a veterinarian, and not try to tackle the problem on your own, said Ward.  ""Diet is not about starvation or deprivation.  It's about gradual weight loss."" In many cases, carefully measuring food and committing to exercise can do the trick.  But more severe cases need more extensive work. iReport: Fat cat makes floors creak . That's what helped Jane Whitehead's dog, Raleigh. In February 2006, he weighed a whopping 187 pounds. ""I swear, we didn't overfeed him!"" Whitehead said of Raleigh who, like Dodger, is a rescue dog. ""We would try giving him smaller and smaller portions of his regular food and he kept gaining and kept gaining."" A series of tests found nothing wrong with him, but ""at a certain point when he had become so obese, he couldn't exercise at all.  We would try to walk him a little bit and he would just stop,"" said Whitehead, CFO of a business in Duluth, Georgia. A veterinarian switched him to ""super low-calorie food"" and put Raleigh on an underwater treadmill, which he loved. ""He lost enough that he could exercise on his own and go for walks with us.""  The energetic Raleigh she loved was back. Within three years, Raleigh had cut his weight in half. There are few truly lost causes, Ward said.  And that's something critical for owners to know. iReport: A real-life Garfield . Beth Spiess of San Marcos, Texas, said her sheltie, Daisy, became so obese from over-feeding that she couldn't walk, and her previous owners wanted to put her to sleep. The vet refused and gave the dog to a shelter, where Spiess adopted her.  Daisy has lost 30 pounds. iReport: Daisy, before and after . ""It's hard to believe she is the same dog,"" Spiess told CNN in an iReport, though Daisy still needs pills to help with arthritis caused by the obesity. Cat owners can face more of an uphill climb in trying to get their pets to exercise, Ward said. Stacie Schafer of Brunswick, Ohio, said people often remark that her cat, Sophie -- now nicknamed Meatloaf -- ""is the fattest cat I have ever seen."" Schafer has tried to get Sophie to run around like the other two cats in the home, but Sophie just isn't that interested. ""Cats don't jog,"" Ward said.  ""Cats by nature are anaerobic creatures.  That means they use sugar as their primary energy source. ... They sprint, they pounce, they leap."" Schafer has tried diet cat food and portion control as well, with little results. Ward recommends families facing trouble work with veterinarians to find ways to bring down the weight. In the end, living a life in which you prioritize healthy eating and exercise for all members of the family, including domesticated furry friends, is the key, he said. That means no more treats -- ""calorie grenades"" -- every time your dog does a trick.  ""They want reward, praise, affection. We take the easy way out, reach into the cookie jar."" It also means snacking on single-ingredient treats like celery, broccoli and asparagus. And it means moving to stay healthy and stay alive. ""Unless we really get a grip on this very quickly,"" said Ward, ""We're going to see an entire generation of pets that don't live as long as the pets I had when I was a child.""","The majority of adult dogs and cats are overweight, study finds .

"Sgt. Terry Mitchell withstood fire deep in the mountains of Vietnam and was exposed to Agent Orange. He survived that grisly war, but now, four decades later, his wife believes his life was cut short by delays in care at the Veterans Administration. On August 8, 2012, a pathology report found that a growth on Mitchell's neck was ""concerning"" for cancer. The recommendation: ""total excision,"" meaning surgical removal. But Mitchell's tumor wasn't removed until October 22, more than 2½ months later. Ten months after that, Mitchell was dead. He was 63. The VA Medical Center in Dallas tells CNN that Mitchell's 75-day wait to have the cancer taken out of his body ""meets the standard of care"" at the VA. That has a lot of people worried. ""I really don't think it's appropriate that our vets have to wait for months,"" said Dr. Karl Bilimoria, who worked at three VA medical centers and is now a cancer surgeon at Northwestern University. ""That's just the way the VA works, and it's sort of been this way for years."" In 2011, Bilimoria and his colleagues published the results from their study on wait times for eight common cancers at Veterans Administration medical centers. The researchers found that waits from cancer diagnosis to surgery were longer at VA centers for all cancer types when compared with waits for the same cancers at community hospitals. For liver and colon cancers specifically, the VA surgery wait times were more than twice as long. In a statement, the VA told CNN, ""No Veteran should ever have to wait to receive the care they have earned through their service and sacrifice. We must work together to fix the unacceptable, systemic problems in accessing VA healthcare."" VA doctor: Timeliness not at the top of my list . For three years, Bilimoria and his team shared their results with leaders at the VA. Though many were outraged about the long waits, nothing seemed to change. ""We clearly haven't seen any major initiatives,"" Bilimoria said. In October, one of Bilimoria's colleagues at Northwestern wrote an e-mail directly to the head of oncology for the VA nationwide. Dr. Michael Kelley wrote back quickly, saying in part, ""Timeliness of care is of interest, but would not be at the top of my list."" Kelley added that even if there are delays at the VA, ""it does not appear to result in worse survival"" for veterans. In a statement to CNN, Kelley wrote, ""No Veteran should have to wait for needed cancer care. It is not appropriate or acceptable for a Veteran to wait for months for cancer surgery. I strongly believe that timeliness in the delivery of care is a top priority, which is why I've been actively engaged in the improvement of VA's quality and timeliness of care."" A VA official said that what Kelley meant in his e-mail to Bilimoria's colleagues is that he didn't think the Northwestern research was the highest priority, and he questioned those researchers' findings. The official added that in 2007, the VA established a quality improvement program called Cancer Care Collaboratives. The official said the program made ""demonstrable improvement in quality metrics, including timeliness,"" but declined to be specific about those improvements. VA boss plans 'personal action' this week in wait-list case . A phone call for a dead man . The question burning in Vicki Mitchell's mind is this: Would her husband have lived if he'd had his surgery earlier? It's almost impossible to answer. The VA says it commissioned an independent review of cancer care that showed ""in nearly all respects, the quality of VA care equaled or exceeded that of non-VA care."" But other studies have disagreed. One showed, for example, that the mortality rate at the VA after pancreatic cancer surgery is 2½ times higher than the mortality rate at large academic health centers. The complication rate was 58% higher among VA patients. Mitchell, who still lives in Sherman, Texas, knows she'll never have an answer. But she sensed confusion at the VA as her husband was treated for a rare sarcoma, a cancer that develops from soft tissues like fat, muscle and deep skin tissues. For example, the VA sent him to an outside specialist for a surgery that turned out to be the wrong procedure for him, so he was sent back to the VA, losing precious time. She remembers leaving desperate phone messages at the VA that were never returned, although the VA says that all calls were answered in a timely manner. Mitchell says the confusion continued even after her husband's death. Just a few months ago, the VA called, asking to make an appointment for the veteran. She politely told them he was dead. ""The lady said, 'I guess I really need to update my computer,' "" Mitchell remembered. ""I said 'yes, you really do.' "" Obama to tap former chief of Procter & Gamble to clean up VA .

"(CNN) -- Mexico is set to return to the Formula One calendar after an absence of more than two decades, F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone has confirmed. The Mexico Grand Prix, along with races in New Jersey and South Korea, were included on the provisional calendar for 2014 only to be axed last December. But after last year's false start, the country now looks set to host its first F1 race in 23 years. ""I'm happy to announce we've concluded an agreement to have a race in 2015,"" Ecclestone said, the sport's official website reported. ""Don't miss this race!"" The race will be run at a refurbished 4.421-kilometre Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez circuit in Mexico City. A date has yet to be finalized. Tavo Hellmund, organizer of the U.S. Grand Prix in Austin, Texas and co-founding partner of the new Mexican Grand Prix said he was ""delighted"" a deal had been reached. ""Ever since Bernie and I began working on a race at Austin, it's been a dream of mine to help Formula One return to Mexico,"" said Hellmund. ""This announcement has therefore been years in the making, but we've gradually been able to assemble all the right pieces. I'm absolutely delighted,"" he added. Force India driver Sergio Perez, one of two Mexican drivers currently on the grid, also hailed the news. ""The return of F1 to our country is a sign that the Mexican state can achieve anything."" Perez wrote on his official website. ""It's a great opportunity to show the world what Mexico is and what we are capable of achieving. We're big and when we have the same tools as our competitors, we are the best in the world."" His compatriot and Sauber driver Esteban Gutierrez also tweeted his approval. Perez was two years old when Britain's Nigel Mansell won the last F1 race in Mexico in 1992. Mexico hosted official F1 racing for eight years between 1963 and 1970. The race was taken off the calendar for 15 years before returning in 1986. Read more: Latest news from 2014 F1 season .","F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone says race will take place in Mexico next season .

"Roughly half the schedulers at multiple Veterans Affairs hospitals said they received instructions from supervisors to falsify data and hide the true time it took patients to be seen by a doctor after making an appointment, new details from an internal VA audit show. Schedulers said supervisors directed them to manipulate information so their centers could meet performance goals, which would help top officials get bonuses, according to documents obtained by CNN. The new information also provided to Congress this week includes updates from specific VA hospitals that were not included in an internal audit released last month by the embattled agency. The ongoing saga involves multiple investigations into delayed care, potentially with deadly results, alarming management shortcomings and a culture that was said to have compromised the mission of providing prompt and effective medical care to millions of veterans, some of them returning soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan. New VA secretary confirmed . VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned over the scandal in May. His replacement, Robert McDonald, was confirmed by the Senate on Tuesday unanimously. The former corporate CEO and ex-Army officer has pledged to swiftly introduce reforms. Under pressure from constituents back home and most members facing voters in November, Congress is poised to approve a $17 billion bipartisan proposal before the week is out. It would allow the agency to hire more medical staff, lease new facilities, and give veterans the opportunity to seek care outside the VA system. It would also allow the VA secretary to more easily fire top officials. Details of delayed care were first reported by CNN in an investigation of two VA hospitals in the Southeast. Since, CNN reporting has expanded to include more hospitals and details of delayed care and allegations that up to 40 deaths were tied to the problem. Congress comes up with a deal on veterans . Greater range of problems . While the Phoenix VA medical center has received the most national scrutiny, the new information shows in greater depth a range of problems affecting numerous facilities nationwide. VA hospitals in Montgomery, Alabama, Clarksburg, West Virginia, and White City, Oregon, were among the worst cited in the new information. About 50% of schedulers at those facilities reported being told by their superiors to falsify data. Moreover, schedulers in Washington, Richmond, Gainesville, Florida, and San Juan, Puerto Rico, and elsewhere used ""outside tracking logs"" to hide long delays in care by not properly recording information in the scheduling system, the documents showed. Numerous other VA medical centers may have improperly used ""paper wait lists"" or excel spreadsheets to hide delays, according to the new internal audit details. Data from the audit released last month found that 13% of schedulers surveyed nationally said they were directed by hospital administrators to enter appointment dates that were different from those requested by a veteran. But the newly released data showed 55 of the VA medical centers audited had more than 13% of schedulers reporting such direction, the documents showed. Bad VA care may have killed more than 1,000 veterans, senator's report says . Coaching schedulers . Scheduling staff training has been controversial throughout recent investigations of VA management. The audit also showed that half of schedulers surveyed could not remember the date of their last training. The findings also showed there were attempts to coach and prepare staff and schedulers in a number of cases before they were questioned by auditors. House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller said any VA administrator who ordered employees to purposely manipulate patient wait times should be immediately fired. ""The environment in today's Veterans Health Administration is one in which some VA executives are so driven in their quest for performance bonuses, promotions and power that they are willing to lie, cheat and put the health of the veterans they were hired to serve at risk,"" Miller said. Gingrich Opinion: We owe our veterans real change . VA takes action . The VA said in a statement on its website on Tuesday that it had proposed ""a series of disciplinary"" actions against six employees in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and Fort Collins, Colorado, as a result of the audit. ""Employees who have been found to have manipulated data, withheld accurate information from their supervisors, and affected the timeliness of care veterans receive do not reflect VA's values, and their actions will not be tolerated,"" said Acting Secretary Sloan Gibson. Carolyn Lerner, head of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, said, ""We are encouraged by the VA's action in response to Office of Special Counsel's reports regarding whistleblower disclosures of manipulated wait-time data that masked scheduling problems at the VA's Cheyenne and Fort Collins facilities."" The office is charged with representing whistleblowers across the country. Who is Bob McDonald? Veterans waiting longer for cancer care .

"It's time to reset the post-Edward Snowden debate. On the first anniversary of the first published leaks about the National Security Agency's far-reaching surveillance programs, the discussions remain focused on the tradeoffs between individual privacy and U.S. security. Despite government officials' attempts to justify the value of NSA programs, experts have pointed out that the vast surveillance apparatus is not effective at protecting Americans from terrorism. In fact, there's compelling evidence that NSA activities are hurting the United States. They threaten our economic interests, undermine our foreign policy objectives and damage the security of the global Internet. In less than a year, American companies such as Cisco and IBM reported declining sales overseas and lost business opportunities. Foreign companies are turning U.S. surveillance into a competitive advantage. For example, Deutsche Telekom has marketed ""e-mail made in Germany"" as a secure alternative after the NSA leaks. Meanwhile, the cloud computing industry is projected to lose between $25 billion and $180 billion in the next three to five years as customers become increasingly concerned about where their private data is stored. And proposals by Germany and India that would require data on their citizens be stored locally could compound U.S. business losses. NSA's surveillance programs have also impacted U.S. foreign policy goals and hurt our relations with strategic allies, as we've found in preparing for an upcoming report on the topic. The credibility of the Internet Freedom agenda, a major initiative launched by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2010, has been sapped. Russia and China, which have sought to exert greater control over the Internet for many years, are growing more skeptical of the American role in governance of the Internet. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was enraged to discover that the NSA had listened to calls on her personal cell phone, creating tension between the United States and Germany as the two must work together on issues such as the Ukraine crisis. Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff became the first world leader to turn down a state dinner with the President of the United States. Moreover, the disclosures exposed various ways the NSA has actively undermined Internet security in the past decade. Under the guise of providing technical expertise, the agency deliberately weakened international encryption standards adopted by the National Institute for Standards and Technology. Encryption forms the basis for trust on the Internet, and developers in the United States and around the world rely on the institute's technical standards to build secure products. Additionally, the NSA quietly asked individual companies to insert backdoors into their products to facilitate spying and covertly stockpiled information about security vulnerabilities that NSA hackers discovered in commercial products, rather than responsibly notifying vendors so they could patch their products. The NSA has even carried out offensive hacking operations such as spoofing Facebook and LinkedIn to perform ""man-in-the-middle"" attacks to insert malware onto targets' devices. The Obama administration has undertaken modest steps to mitigate the damage caused by the NSA and begin the slow, difficult process of rebuilding trust in the United States as a responsible steward of modern communications networks. In January, President Barack Obama issued Presidential Policy Directive 28, which placed some limitations on authorities to collect signals intelligence. In May, the House of Representatives passed the USA FREEDOM Act, which is quite watered down but could still bring about limited reform to the bulk collection program. The National Institute of Standards and Technology convened a group of outside experts to review its cryptographic standards and guidelines, and there are proposals to remove the statutory requirement that it consult with the NSA on certain standards. These proposals are narrow in scope. Further reforms must be broader. In the coming months, lawmakers must continue to strengthen protections against data collection on Americans and foreigners, here and abroad. The government must also recommit to the Internet Freedom agenda and move toward robust international standards on surveillance that are grounded in human rights. Finally, more transparency is needed. Last fall, a coalition of major Internet companies joined privacy experts and public interest advocates in calling for far greater corporate and government transparency, asking that they be allowed to release more detailed information about the quantity, nature and scope of requests they receive from intelligence officials. The unlikely partnerships that have sprung up in the past year between of some of Internet's biggest rivals speak to the seriousness of the threats to their collective business interests. While the initial shock of NSA surveillance may have faded a bit, the deeper concerns are not going away any time soon. That's why we need a firm commitment to reforms that go above and beyond the provisions of the House's USA FREEDOM Act. Companies need to be able to inform consumers around the world in much greater detail about the scope and impact of the NSA's surveillance programs -- an important step to stopping businesses and individuals from permanently turning away from the United States to escape the surveillance dragnet.","It's been a year since Edward Snowden's disclosures about NSA spying .

"Syria, which has long accused Arab and Western satellite news networks for fabricating and falsifying events, now has CNN in its sights. State-run Syrian media asserted Thursday that CNN journalists were involved in blowing up an oil pipeline in Homs province, collaborating with ""saboteurs."" The allegations surfaced when Syrian state TV aired portions of the CNN documentary ""72 Hours Under Fire,"" about the challenges faced by a CNN team while on assignment in Homs. ""72 Hours Under Fire"": Life and death under Syria's onslaught . Rafiq Lutf, described as a member of the Arab Journalists Union in America, asked on the program: ""Who is behind the attack? It is one particular group. Who is this group? Let (CNN) answer this question. It's one of two things. It is either that they are the perpetrators. ... But I guarantee to you that they are the accomplices."" The anchor talking with Lutf spoke of ""conclusive evidence of the involvement of CNN and the American journalists who were present there in the detonation of the oil pipelines in Homs."" Syria's state news agency SANA picked up the theme Friday, writing that the footage ""revealed that the camera operators were CNN correspondents who entered Syria illegally through the Lebanese borders and seemed to have coordinated with the saboteurs to film a video of the attack and send it to their channel."" SANA also reported that CNN claimed the ""Syrian army was behind the attack to deflect suspicion of any coordination, if not to say involvement, with the terrorist saboteurs."" Tony Maddox, executive vice president and managing director of CNN International, called the assertions ""ridiculous."" ""We stand firmly behind our excellent reporting on Syria,"" he said. ""It is a pity that its citizens did not get to see this important documentary without these ridiculous interventions."" Among other allegations made on the program, Lutf asked whether American media outlets were working with al Qaeda, which he linked to the Free Syrian Army resistance. ""Why are they now working with al Qaeda?"" he asks. ""I lived in America for 16 years, and I know the Americans are good people."" There have been other unlikely claims by Syrian state media against what they see as international conspiracies against the regime. A state TV anchor said Al-Jazeera, the Arabic-language news network, ""depended on armed individuals, the terrorists as correspondents."" Syrian networks devote hours every day to projecting the government's message and discrediting any version of events that differs from the regime's. Syria has been cracking down on anti-regime protesters for more than a year, and during that time, Syria has blocked unhindered access to international journalists. As a result, it is nearly impossible to confirm events there independently. The government has consistently blamed the violence in the country on terrorist groups, but activists say the government security forces and their militia allies have instigated attacks against civilians.","Syrian media claim journalists helped blow up oil pipeline in Homs .

"Another ""tiger"" has been caught.  Last week, Ji Jianye, the mayor of my hometown Nanjing, a major city in eastern China, was arrested on suspicion of accepting bribes worth about 20 million yuan ($3.3 million) After taking power in March, President Xi Jinping launched a high-profile anti-corruption campaign, vowing to catch both tigers and flies -- big and small corrupt officials.  China has seen plenty of such campaigns, arising and subsiding like summer storms. But this one appears to be the most vigorous since China opened up; when corruption became rampant in the new market economy and officials started to trade power for financial gains. Much as I appreciate our president's determination, his battle feels like an attempt to ""put out a big fire with a glass of water,"" given how corruption has reached every corner of our society. Chinese public opinion surveys identify corruption as the most hated social problem, yet everyone is also guilty of it. Last year, when my father fell seriously ill, we took him to a decent hospital close by but were told the beds were fully occupied.  As always, we turned to our guanxi -- our network of connections -- for help. Fortunately, a relative, a not so senior but well-connected official, managed to secure a private room at the hospital, which is reserved for ranking leaders.  In return, the relative agreed to get the son of the hospital director into the most desirable school in Nanjing. I became aware the weight of guanxi shortly after I was thrust into adulthood: At 16 I was dragged out of the school to work at a military rocket factory. Two months later, when Spring Festival came, my mother requested that I visit my boss' home with gifts she had prepared.  Naive and embarrassed, I refused.  Mother angrily predicted: ""You'll never go far in life if you don't know how to la guanxi!""  The verb la means to pull or to develop.  Sure enough, I never got any promotion during my decade-long stint at the factory even though I acquired a degree in mechanical engineering. For any Chinese businessman, guanxi is essential.  Recently, I met up with a long-lost friend, with whom I marched in the Nanjing streets back in the spring of 1989 and shouted ""Down With Corruption"" -- one of the complaints that had sparked the unprecedented Tiananmen Square democratic movement. More than 20 years later, this friend spends 90% of his time running his high-tech company.  His youthful idealism has gone and his waistline has expanded considerably.  With a ghost of a smile, he blames it on the excessive dining, drinking and occasional visits to prostitutes that are part of the tiresome game of guanxi.  ""Your business can't survive a day if you are not corrupt,"" he told me. He has to smooth every step of his business with gifts or outright bribes: From obtaining the business license, to entertaining potential clients, to receiving 15% of the tax deduction that a high-tech company is entitled to.  He estimates that 3% to 5 % of operating costs goes to guanxi. Such practices drive entrepreneurs to seek senior officials as their patrons because politicians in China have the power to approve projects and allocate resources. The relationship between the now disgraced politician Bo Xilai and businessmen Xu Ming, the founder of Dalian Shide Group, was typical of such patron-client relationships.  Xu, a large man, allegedly fattened his pockets through his guanxi with the Bo family as he funded the family's jet-set life style. Xu was detained shortly after Bo's arrest and testified against Bo at his trial in August, although Xu has not been charged with any wrongdoing. Local media reports suggest that authorities are investigating similar ties between the newly disgraced Nanjing mayor and Zhu Xingliang, the richest businessman in Suzhou, a city near Nanjing, who has also been placed under house arrest. And politically, China produces its top leaders more or less based on patron-client ties rather than meritocracy.  Both President Xi and Bo are ""princelings"" -- the children of senior leaders, the most powerful and influential group in China.  Nepotism, a form of corruption, has feudal roots. In fact, I believe the whole corrupt practice of guanxi is rooted in China's long tradition of renzhi -- rule of men rather than the rule of law. President Xi has called for a curb on official extravagance: No red carpet treatment, no luxury banquets and no fancy office buildings.  But these are the symptoms not the root of the problem. To stamp out corruption, he will have to not only observe the rule of law but also introduce genuine political reforms that would allow checks and balances, transparency, and independent scrutiny.  Such remedies, although proven elsewhere, may be too strong for him to take. I don't doubt that the authorities will net more tigers.  But there will be hundreds and thousands more at large and countless flies, thriving in China's politically and culturally rich breeding ground for corruption.","Everyone in China is guilty of corruption, says writer Lijia Zhang .

"Google has made a bold statement against discrimination on its home page. The search giant's rainbow Olympic-themed logo, posted to mark the first day of the Sochi Winter Games, sends a powerful message of support for not only gay athletes competing in the games, but for the gay community at large and its supporters. The company often changes its logo to reflect current events or to mark significant anniversaries. The latest ""Google doodle"" features images of athletes involved in Winter Olympic events, against a backdrop colored like the rainbow flag, the adopted symbol of the movement for gay rights. Unlike the current iteration, Google doodles usually conform to the company logo's color scheme. Under the search bar, the company quotes the Olympic Charter, which promises all athletes the right to practice sport. ""The practice of sport is a human right. Every individual must have the possibility of practicing sport, without discrimination of any kind and in the Olympic spirit, which requires mutual understanding with a spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play,"" the Charter excerpt reads. The quoted paragraph is the fourth in the Charter's ""fundamental principles of Olympism"" (pdf). The colored logo is a direct rebuke to Russian president Vladimir Putin's government, whose recently-introduced anti-gay legislation, the so-called anti-gay propaganda law, has been a focal point of critics of these Games. Opponents argue that the laws that Putin's government enacted last year are in contravention to the spirit of the Games. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak, recently warned both spectators and athletes against promoting gay rights during the Olympics. Last month Anatoly Pakhomov, the Mayor of Sochi, drew ridicule by suggesting that the city was devoid of gay people. Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, used his speech to the International Olympic Committee on Thursday to offer support to the LGBT community, saying that ""many professional athletes, gay and straight, are speaking out against prejudice."" Google's undisputed position as the world's most-used search engine means that this is a rebuke that may be seen by billions. The Sochi Winter Olympics officially open today and will run until the 23rd of February.","Google doodle supports LGBT community with rainbow flag and Olympic Charter quote .

"The air traffic control system for London airspace has been restored after a technical failure, the UK air traffic management company NATS said Friday, but travelers can expect disruptions and flight cancellations. ""We are in the process of returning to normal operations. We apologize for any delays and the inconvenience this may have caused,"" NATS said. It later issued a release saying that it had ruled out a power outage as a cause of the fault, which resulted in the temporary closure of London's airspace. Interactive: Track the flights here . Travelers passing through London can expect delays or disruption to their flights for hours to come. Heathrow Airport said the NATS systems were ""now working and stable,"" but about 50 flights had been canceled by 5:30 p.m. GMT (12:30 p.m. ET), with the number expected to rise over the evening and into Saturday. ""The earlier problem will cause delays and cancellations to flights for the rest of the day and is likely to have a knock-on effect on some services tomorrow because aircraft and crew will now be out of position,"" Heathrow said in a statement. ""Passengers due to depart today and tomorrow should check the status of their flight with their airline before traveling to Heathrow. We are very sorry for the disruption to passengers' journeys."" Extra staff will be on duty to help passengers, it said. Luton, Gatwick and Stansted airports, which all serve London, also warned of delays. The disruption caused big problems inside Heathrow. Hundreds of unclaimed bags sat beside carousels inside Terminal 5's baggage claim. A baggage handler told CNN some people grew tired of waiting and left without collecting their bags. Carousels were not assigned for some incoming flights. A spokesman for budget airline Ryanair, Robin Kiely, told CNN that flights were expected to resume with delays but that cancellations were not expected. 'Humongous impact' of one error . Kiely slammed NATS over the problem, saying it was ""unacceptable"" that its system had ""dropped for the second time in 12 months, particularly on a busy Friday in the run-up to Christmas."" Paul Beauchamp, a spokesman for NATS, said, ""We think there is problem with the flight data system although not exactly sure at this time."" He told CNN its systems were not hacked and that idea ""has been ruled out completely."" Aviation security expert Glenn Schoen told CNN the incident had exposed a weakness in the air traffic system, a problem that needs to be addressed urgently. ""We're going to have a major digital forensic effort here I think, driven by British authorities -- maybe with assistance from international aviation authorities -- to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible,"" he said. ""The disconcerting aspect here is the humongous impact of what appears to be one technical error. It doesn't appear like a whole group of people made a mistake or a whole group of systems all had an error at the same time, so it tells us somewhere in how the system is configured now there are vulnerabilities we did not know about and apparently have not been accounted for in terms of control measures."" British Airways offered refunds or the chance to rebook to any of its passengers not wishing to travel Friday in light of the problems. ""We anticipate disruption to both departing and arriving flights but will do all we can to minimize any impact,"" it said in a statement. International consequences . It's not just UK travelers who will be affected by the glitch. ""All flights that are supposed to fly London from Charles de Gaulle are delayed,"" a representative for Paris Charles de Gaulle airport told CNN. ""Flights from Tunisia will be landing at Charles de Gaulle instead of London."" Mary Ryan, a spokeswoman for United Airlines, said none of its inbound flights Friday was affected but that four outbound flights were being held at the gate until the issue was resolved. A spokesman for Delta Air Lines advised passengers bound for London on Friday to check the status of their flights before traveling. The European air traffic control network, Eurocontrol, earlier said no flights would be accepted in or out of London until 7 p.m. (2 p.m. ET.) The issue affected the air traffic control center in Swanwick, which controls all air traffic routes in southern England and Wales, up to approximately Manchester. A second air traffic control center at Prestwick in Scotland takes over air routes from there. It was not affected, NATS said. A problem with many moving parts . CNN's Jim Boulden said more than 80 airlines fly into and out of Heathrow, with some 200,000 people passing through the airport daily. ""The system is working fine, but it's the aircraft that are in the wrong place -- it's the aircraft that are delayed,"" he said Friday evening. ""There's a number of planes that have been diverted to other places. They still have to get here -- to London."" Schoen, the aviation security expert, said the resulting effects would be significant. He said they include ""the parking of the aircraft, refueling, servicing of the aircraft, the security guarding and checking of the aircraft, the handling of the passengers at different airports where they're not really planning on that kind of capacity for the coming night -- perhaps this is happening overseas as well -- flights that were en route to the United Kingdom now diverting to other places. ""Hopefully this will not affect some of the biggest, busiest flights. Think about you piloting an Airbus A380 en route to London and you needing to divert, and having to fit that into a schedule of another airport. So these are some major challenges throughout the system that we're hoping and we're assuming authorities -- not just in the UK but elsewhere as well -- are ready to handle now.""

"(CNN) -- One night in late July this year, the Japanese supertanker M. Star was making its way through the Strait of Hormuz -- the chokepoint at the southern tip of the Persian Gulf. It was en route to Japan with 3 million barrels of crude oil. There was a loud thud at the front of the ship. Its hull suffered a substantial square-shaped dent above the waterline. Theories about the cause quickly abounded: a giant wave, a collision with a submarine or another vessel. And then -- six days later -- a militant Sunni group that had been active in Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan claimed it had attacked the ship with an explosives-laden boat. The Abdullah Azzam Brigades said the attack on the M. Star ""sought to weaken the infidel global order which is thrust into Muslim lands and which loots its resources."" For the Brigades, such an attack was a significant departure from previous targets. To begin with, intelligence analysts were skeptical of the claim. But U.S. officials now say it is credible. ""Government and industry sources can confirm that the claim by the Abdullah Azzam brigades ... is valid,"" the U.S. Department of Transportation's Maritime Administration said in an advisory last week. ""The group remains active and can conduct further attacks on vessels in areas in the Strait of Hormuz, southern Arabian Gulf, and western Gulf of Oman,' it said. The Saudis are already anxious about the foothold that al Qaeda has established in neighboring Yemen.  Now the Brigades -- spawned in the squalor of Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon -- may be an emerging player in the region's terror landscape. The Brigades are named after a Palestinian close to al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.  Abdullah Azzam was killed in Pakistan in 1989 by a bomb explosion. The group is led by one Saleh al-Qarawi, who fought U.S. forces in Iraq and got to know al Qaeda's now-dead leader there -- Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Born in the Saudi city of Barida, al-Qarawi is only 28, but is already on the kingdom's most wanted list. When that list was first published in February 2008, he was described as ""one of the key suppliers of facilities, finances, fake documents"" for al Qaeda. And he has ambitious aims, telling an extremist website earlier this year: ""All the jihadist battlefields now are fields of fighting."" The Brigades have certainly shown themselves capable of audacious attacks. They claimed responsibility for an unsuccessful  rocket attack on a U.S. warship anchored in the Jordanian port of Aqaba in 2005, as well as for bombings in 2004 and 2005 aimed at tourists in Egypt's Red Sea resorts. Well over 100 people were killed in those attacks. In the interview he gave to the al-Fajr Media Center, al-Qarawi described how al-Zarqawi had sent him on a mission beyond Iraq. He'd been arrested in Syria and spent a brief spell in a Saudi jail. Describing his priorities, al-Qarawi said they include kidnapping U.S. and British citizens in the Arabian peninsula. ""American interests are our most important aims,"" he said, according to a translation by intelligence website Flashpoint Partners. It is also clear from the interview that al-Qarawi is very much a Sunni purist. He has little time for the Shiite Hezbollah, accusing it of attacking Lebanon's Sunnis. He also accuses Lebanese Shiites of ""malice"" toward the country's Sunnis. That suggests the Brigades would not have looked to Shiite Iran for help or harbor in attacking the M. Star (even if Saudi officials insist al-Qarawi once operated from Iran.) And it prompts this question: where did that small boat, laden with explosives, come from on the night of July 27 to attack the M. Star? If not Iran, did it set out under cover of darkness from the United Arab Emirates, Oman or even Saudi Arabia -- undetected by authorities?","The Abdullah Azzam Brigades may be an emerging player in the Persian Gulf landscape .

"The ""Niantic"" was a whaling ship used during the Gold Rush of the 1800s and then run aground to be used for storage and as a hotel in a place now known as San Francisco. As the city grew and changed, the ship was built over and around many times, becoming part of the foundation of the city and now residing, at least in part, in the San Francisco Maritime Museum. A group at Google has adopted that ship's name, with the goal of crafting apps that encourage users to explore the world around them and, in the process, discover such hidden gems. The idea, according to John Hanke, vice president of product development for Niantic Labs, was to get people moving, exploring, and having fun during the normally stationary act of playing on their phones. ""The theme of the group was the things around you that just lie beneath the surface, the unseen world,"" Hanke said. ""The information exists on the Internet, but these are probably things you don't notice in the real world. The information, although it is there, is often difficult to get to."" Niantic Labs has been working on two apps -- ""Field Trip"" and ""Ingress."" ""Field Trip"" links 130 different information sources to your smartphone's GPS, resulting in alerts to interesting things currently around you. The app, which is available for iOS and Android phones, has been out for about a year, but is now available for use with Google Glass as well. The advantage of Glass, Hanke said, is that it lets users walk around, hands-free and experience things in a new way. ""The idea (with Google Glass integration) is that the information can get to you in a way that isn't disruptive with what you are doing,"" he said. ""You can still interact with the people around you; you can glance up and see it; you can have it read to you. But you have that awareness of 'This is what that place is, this is what used to be here.' "" During a demonstration in Washington, the app alerted me to nearby restaurants in the Google Glass display. I could choose to ignore them or go deeper into the information without pulling out a phone or bothering the people around me. In another example, the background and history on an unusual building popped up and could be read to me as I studied the building. ""You're not lost in your phone. You can get (the information) read in your ear. You now know that information and you can do with it whatever you want,"" Hanke said. ""It's kind of like having a smart local (person) walking beside you telling you where everything is."" If ""Field Trip"" is meant to be a helpful app for a leisurely stroll, ""Ingress"" offers something else entirely: a competitive, worldwide game for the Android phone where the enemy could be the person next to you on any given street corner. While encouraging fierce competition, ""Ingress"" has organically evolved during its beta run into an app that brings people together socially and creates connections between players beyond the game. Recently, Google has been touring the world for an in-game event called Operation Cassandra. The goal of the game, according to the elaborate, sci-fi inspired story Niantic has crafted for ""Ingress,"" is for groups representing the two warring factions -- the Enlightened and the Resistance -- to create virtual fields that blanket an area and control the people therein. Virtual hot-spots, called ""portals"" in the game, appear at the GPS locations of real landmarks like public art, historic buildings, museums, local institutions and churches. Players must be in the real-world location of these portals to ""capture"" them for their team. Hanke said his original plan was to create an MMO (massively multiplayer online) game where people all over the world could play in their own time toward a common goal. But when people started gathering in cities to capture portals, he says, something amazing happened. ""Getting together in the real world, people are going out and playing for an hour -- or sometimes all night -- and then having beers or breakfast together,"" he said. ""People are doing that; I never expected them to when I designed this game."" In ""Ingress,"" there is always competition on a local level, as well as the occasional special event, with a specific, time-sensitive goal, that can draw dozens of players from both factions. Recently, Google has been hopping from city to city for major gatherings, though, drawing player numbers in the hundreds. Sydney, Australia; New York, Chicago, Boston, Washington, and Cologne and Dusseldorf in Germany, have all been the sites of such events. Daphne Domingo, one of the main organizers in Washington, said that while she isn't normally a competitive person, the social aspects of the game make it fun. ""You have so many different socio-economical backgrounds in the players and we've all become dearest friends,"" Domingo said. ""You really can't do it alone. You have to work with other people and we've all become good friends, no matter what side you're on."" Lindsey Boyle, a tech researcher for the U.S. Department of State, said the game is addictive, but not so much that she won't invite everyone, even opponents, out for brunch afterward. ""You're meeting strangers and you're sharing a bond when we're playing,"" Boyle said. ""It grows and you start hanging out even when you aren't playing."" The launch video for the game nearly six months ago showed two people eyeing each other warily at a portal, wondering which side the other was on. Hanke said he expected some of that to happen, but what he didn't expect was for those people to actually start talking to each other. Said Hanke: ""On social media, and even in the real world, people started doing that and walking up to other people and saying, 'You're playing 'Ingress,' aren't you?' "" ""Then these local clubs began to form and they started sending us pictures of their meet-ups. We started planning these events around that organic phenomenon."" One player described hanging out with other players from both sides as ""friend-ponents, not frienemies."" ""There is a rivalry, but there is also a camaraderie,"" said Filemon Palero. ""There is a feeling of being together when you are doing something as a team. I found I was going to see exhibits around D.C. just because of 'Ingress.' "" The Android-only game is still in closed beta and by invitation only, but Hanke said his team is handing out invitations as quickly as they get requests. He thinks the game will be ready soon to be opened to players everywhere and hopes the hive mind, collective intelligence of the world will enjoy solving his puzzles. ""People were sending us videos of players trudging through the snow (in Russia) playing 'Ingress,' "" he said. ""That blew our minds people were doing that.""","Google lab works on apps that help users discover interesting things .
