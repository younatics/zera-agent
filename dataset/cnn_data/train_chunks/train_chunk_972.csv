"Close-up: Although Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson endured a stormy relationship during their first film Heartburn, a new biography has claimed they would disappear inside his trailer together when making Ironweed in 1987 . With that permanent grin, quizzical eyebrow and wicked gleam in his eye, Jack Nicholson has famously seduced scores of glamorous women, amply living up to the ‘horny little devil’ he played in The Witches Of Eastwick. But the serene Meryl Streep, Hollywood’s sweetheart, was never assumed to be one of them. They had endured a notably stormy relationship on their first film together, Heartburn. So — as a new biography claims — there was some surprise among fellow cast and crew of their second movie, the 1987 drama Ironweed, when Streep, then aged 37, disappeared into Nicholson’s Winnebago trailer for long tete-a-tetes with her 50-year-old co-star. According to biographer Marc Eliot, the pair weren’t discussing the script. He claims the trailer would rock around with such energy that it seemed to be balanced on thin springs — ‘four overworked Slinkys’, as one alleged witness put it, referring to the popular children’s spring toy. ‘Whatever is going on inside that Winnebago, it’s starting to get out of hand, to the point where it’s embarrassing a lot of people on the set,’ grumbled a film insider, we are told. But how true are these claims? Streep had been married to sculptor Don Gummer since 1978, and she denied allegations of an  affair at the time. Nicholson was in an on-off relationship with actress Anjelica Huston and was also secretly seeing the British-born actress Veronica Cartwright, says biographer Marc Eliot. Ironweed, in which the couple played a homeless couple in the Twenties, was filmed over 17 weeks in Albany in New York state. ‘As soon as it began, rumours exploded like wild mushrooms that something was going on between Jack and his co-star, Meryl “I’ll-never-work-with-him-again” Streep,’ says Eliot. ‘There had been talk that the two had grown unusually close, but both denied it.’ But Nicholson’s alleged tryst with Streep is not the only shocking claim in the new biography of the famously hard-living superstar which details a drug use that was almost as compulsive as his womanising. Hollywood insider Marc Eliot’s book, Nicholson: A Biography, which came out in the U.S. yesterday, would be enough to sink a dozen other Hollywood careers in a tsunami of embarrassment, but one can only imagine it will simply widen the cheeky grin on the famously shameless star’s face. On screen: In the 1987 film Streep, then aged 37, and Nicholson, who was 50, played vagrants in Depression era America . Denial: Meryl Streep, pictured with Jack Nicholson and Mike Nichols in 2010, denied allegations of an affair during filming of Ironweed, in which the pair played a homeless couple . Nicholson, 76, is now into his fifth decade at the top of the Hollywood tree, and has a record 12 Oscar nominations (he’s won three) under his nowadays rather strained belt. But as Eliot details, the child of a poor New Jersey family worked hard for his success. And he played hard, too. Even before he was famous, the parties that Jack Nicholson would throw — the sex, drinks and drugs — were well-known in Sixties Tinseltown. At what was dubbed the ‘wildest house in Hollywood’, Nicholson presided over ‘round-the-clock partying, drinks, drugs, sex . . . and beautiful, hot, willing girls who loved to get just as high as the boys and have a good time,’ writes Eliot. The refrigerator never had any food in it, just milk — for Nicholson’s sensitive stomach — and beer, with cannabis in the freezer to keep it fresh. Harry Dean Stanton, an old crony of Nicholson and another hard partier, says he always remembers his friend in those days with ‘cheap red wine on his lips’ — permanently tipsy and ‘ready to offer any comfort he could to whatever woman needed it’. Actress Sandra Knight was Nicholson’s . first and only wife from 1962 to 1968. But it was his introduction to . LSD, the hallucinogen that powered so many Sixties songs and which was, . in Nicholson’s Hollywood, prescribed by some psychiatrists, that had . possibly the greater impact on his life. History: Nicholson reputedly slept with 2,000 women (he modestly insists he never counted), but the one that lasted the longest - 17 years - was Anjelica Huston, who he was pictured with here in 1976 . He told friends that after taking it for the first time, he had seen the face of God and the drug also gave him castration and homoerotic fear fantasies, as well as revelations about having been an unloved child. Yet Nicholson continued to take LSD for years, along with marijuana and, later, cocaine. The last of these drugs apparently helped with Nicholson’s secret failing — a severe drawback for a lothario — premature ejaculation. Nicholson’s acting career is now so feted that it is hard to believe that it took him some time to establish himself in Hollywood and, in despair at the lack of work, even switched at one point to screenwriting. Revelations: Hollywood insider Marc Eliot's book, Nicholson: A Biography, . came out in the U.S. yesterday . But even if the acting roles took time coming, his charisma made him a permanent presence at parties. Whether . it was Larry Hagman and his wife hosting, or Jane Fonda and her film . director boyfriend Roger Vadim,  Nicholson would be there, holding court . and keeping everyone entertained with his amazing stories. Only one . person outdid Nicholson in the hedonism stakes. Harry Dean Stanton would . throw weekend sex parties, gathering the ‘hottest starlets and all the . available young men, some single and some not, who wanted to get whacked . out and share beds with these naked, luscious, beautiful women’. But Nicholson would usually  shut himself away in his bedroom, tapping out screenplays furiously on his typewriter. It was in 1969 that Nicholson broke into . the big time after he appeared in the cult drugs culture film Easy . Rider. Recruited largely because the director believed the affable . Nicholson would keep co-stars Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper from . fighting, Nicholson was stoned almost the whole time (he reportedly . smoked 155 joints during the time it took to film just one key scene). Stardom quickly engulfed Nicholson in . the Seventies with a succession of acclaimed films including Five Easy . Pieces, Chinatown, One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest and, of course, . 1980’s The Shining. Having divested himself of his wife and daughter, after the former grew tired of his womanising and divorced him, the eternal bachelor moved into a mansion next door to Marlon Brando and down Mulholland Drive from Warren Beatty. (The road was dubbed Bad Boy Drive in their honour). Though Beatty was a legendary skirt-chaser, Hollywood insiders say Nicholson left him standing when it came to success with women. Indeed, the pair would play childish tit-for-tat games in trying to steal girlfriends off each other. Veteran film producer Bob Evans said . Nicholson was the ‘better swordsman’ when it came to cutting through the . starlet population of Hollywood. The actor, he said, was a ‘very big . player . . . not even Warren Beatty has been so successful with women’. Better swordsman: Though Beatty was a legendary skirt-chaser, Hollywood insiders say Nicholson left him standing when it came to success with women . He added: ‘I’ve been at parties where Jack’s been there. Warren’s been there, Clint Eastwood’s been there, Bob Redford. All the girls go to Jack.’ Naturally, Nicholson exploited the sexual opportunities stardom gave him. Making his debut as a director in the 1971 film drama Drive, He Said, Nicholson decided that in-depth research was needed to find the perfect girl for the brief non-sexual nudity in the film. Stoned on cannabis, he auditioned more . than 100 attractive young actresses in his Hollywood office, making each . disrobe in front of him and then subjecting them to a ‘near-medical . examination’. Determined: Nicholson, 76, is now into his fifth decade at the top of the Hollywood tree, and has a record 12 Oscar nominations under his belt . Nicholson reputedly slept with 2,000 women (he modestly insists he never counted), but the one that lasted the longest — 17 years amazingly — was Anjelica Huston. She was 14 years his junior and admitted he fulfilled a paternal need in her. ‘Jack is very definitely a real man, one who gets your blood going,’ she told Eliot. It was just as well he did, as she . had to put up with a lot of cheating. At a party thrown by Mick Jagger . after The Shining premiere, Nicholson couldn’t make up his mind whom to . pursue, but eventually ended up sharing a room for the night with . British actress Rachel Ward. Not . content, he then sent roses every hour on the hour to the other woman . who had caught his eye at the party, notorious rock groupie Bebe Buell. Age difference never bothered Nicholson. He was the other side of 50 when he began an affair with 19-year-old . British actress Karen Mayo-Chandler. Stripping off for Playboy later, . she told the magazine Nicholson was a ‘naughty little boy’ and . ‘guaranteed non-stop sex machine into fun and games, like spankings, . handcuffs, whips and Polaroid pictures’. Huston left Nicholson for good in 1989, . tired of all the other women. For the next few years, his ‘number one’ girlfriend was Rebecca Broussard, mother of two of his four children, . although she too got fed up with his womanising and left him in 1999. Other relationships have followed with glamorous young actresses including Julie Delpy and Twin Peaks star Lara Flynn Boyle. At this year’s Oscars, he tried one of his old chat-up lines — ‘You look like an old girlfriend’ — on the visibly embarrassed award winner Jennifer Lawrence. Just 22 — young enough to be his granddaughter — she cringed at his attentions as she tried to give an interview. Nicholson, who never missed a cue on set, couldn’t have failed to pick up on that one. He’d always been so good at playing creepy characters. Was he now in danger of becoming one?","Book claims pair enjoyed 'tete-a-tetes' inside his Winnebago .

"Created: . 12:35 EST, 19 May 2014 . Off the hook: Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore escapes further disciplinary action . Under-fire football chief Richard Scudamore escaped the sack today despite the Prime Minister joining the backlash against his sexist emails. David Cameron suggested a member of his Cabinet would not survive if they admitted sending crude messages, as the Premier League chief executive had done. But tonight the Premier League announced ‘no further disciplinary action is required or justified’ for Scudamore, who earns a reported £2.5million. He has apologised for his actions. Mr Cameron branded the messages ‘unacceptable’, echoing a chorus of outrage at the derogatory emails in which Scudamore called women ‘broads’ and made sexist jokes about ‘female irrationality’. Asked if a minister would survive such a scandal, Mr Cameron told BBC Radio 5 Live: ‘No I don’t think they would.’ He added: ‘I haven’t actually seen the emails myself but obviously people should treat everybody else with respect.’ Scudamore sent the emails to male colleagues but they were leaked by his former PA, Rani Abraham, who said she was ‘humiliated, belittled and disgusted’ by their content. England and Everton Ladies goalkeeper Rachel Brown-Finnis branded Scudamore's comments an 'insult to all women' and 'negative'. She added: 'I was really disappointed. I wouldn't say I was massively shocked. 'These sorts of judgements and behaviours are not acceptable, not just in the Premier League but across the whole country.' A meeting of the Premier League’s 17 members had been scheduled to decide Scudamore’s fate. Instead a meeting, chaired by McCormick, took place at their Gloucester Place offices. McCormick had carried out an investigation in conjunction with law firm Harbottle & Lewis, specifically appointed for this. The Premier League investigation found no evidence of a wider discriminatory attitude or inappropriate language. In a statement afterwards, Premier League acting chairman Peter McCormick said that football clubs had accepted Scudamore’s ‘sincere’ apology and ‘accepted his undertaking to take active steps to prevent a recurrence’. Scroll down for video . Sexist: Premier League boss Richard Scuadmore's former personal assistant Rani Abraham (left), 41, said she felt a duty to reveal his crude messages about women. England and Everton Ladies goalkeeper Rachel Brown-Finnis says the comments from someone of Scudamore's stature in the game are 'disappointing' The statement added: ‘In these . circumstances and in the light of a previously unblemished record over . 15 years of service to the Premier League, the clubs resolved . unanimously that no further disciplinary action is required or . justified.’ Miss Abraham, 41, said today: ‘I’m delighted that David Cameron has supported my view that Mr Scudamore’s emails were unacceptable. I think it shows what an important and serious matter it is.’ But she added: ‘I can’t understand how the Premier League can claim their investigation is “rigorous” when they have never asked to interview me for my views or experience. ‘Surely, as the person who felt they had no choice but to blow the whistle on what was happening, I should have been their first port of call.’ Scudamore said in a statement he felt sincere contrition over the emails. He said: 'Entering into email exchanges of this nature was wrong and the apology I have made is sincere, as is the contrition I feel. 'These exchanges do not reflect my views towards women in football, the workplace or in general. It is something that will never be repeated. 'The Premier League shareholders have considered and deliberated this matter and I fully accept and respect their recommendations and conclusions. 'I appreciate that I have a tremendous amount of hard work to do to convince those in the game who do not know me that my leadership and work in the areas of equality and discrimination to date reflect who I am and what I believe. 'So, I will now undertake meetings and discussions with a wide range of stakeholders in the game to hear their views and to reassure them that I will continue to do my utmost personally, and through all the Premier League's means to help promote diversity and inclusion, develop the women's game and support women who want be involved in football at any level. 'I am grateful for the support I have received throughout this from family, friends and colleagues, but especially the women who work with me at the Premier League.' Speaking on Good Morning Britain, Miss Abraham said of the emails: ‘They were sexist - very, very degrading to women.’ Asked what she thought should happen to Scudamore, she said: ‘I feel he should resign’ - and if he did not, then he should be asked to leave.’ Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has described Scudamore’s remarks as ‘totally inappropriate’ while Sports Minister Helen Grant branded them ‘unacceptable’. Lord Herman Ouseley, chairman of anti-discrimination campaign group Kick It Out, said today: ‘The top of the football pyramid is still a bastion of white male domination. It will be a long road to achieve equality outcomes. 'No one is ever inclined to give up power, and facing up to culture change can be painful.’ The Football Association’s independent board member Heather Rabbatts will chair a meeting tomorrow. She has already said Scudamore should consider his position in light of ‘growing evidence of a closed culture of sexism’ at the Premier League. Sky Sports presenters Richard Keys (above, right) and Andy Gray (left) exited Sky in 2011 after being caught on tape making sexist comments off-air. Gray was sacked by Sky in January 2011 after he and Keys were heard on air making derogatory remarks about female assistant referee Sian Massey prior to a Premier League match between Wolverhampton and Liverpool. Believing their microphones were off, Gray said: ‘Can you believe that? A female linesman. Women don’t know the offside rule.’ Keys replied: ‘Course they don’t.’ Both were banned before further footage emerged of Gray making an inappropriate comment to Sky Sports presenter Charlotte Jackson off air at the Sky studios. Gray’s contract was immediately terminated by Sky Sports' managing director Barney Francis for unacceptable behaviour, while Keys resigned soon after. Keys also went on to remark on comments made by Karren Brady in the Sun on Saturday morning about the level of sexism in football by saying: 'See charming Karren Brady this morning complaining about sexism? Yeah. Do me a favour, love.' An earlier version of this article said that the audit and remuneration committee had been scheduled to decide Scudamore's case. In fact, it was the Premier League's 17 clubs who met with Richard Scudamore. We are happy to clarify this.","Scudamore escapes sanction after apologising for sexist jokes .

"Germany faces an angry backlash in the US where it has been accused of making a 'dangerous over-reaction' to spying revelations. Responding to German offers of political asylum to fugitive US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden after he revealed Angela Merkel’s phone had been bugged, some commentators have accused pacifist Germany of forgetting who its true friends and enemies are. Germany’s defence and intelligence capabilities have been constrained since the end of the Second World War. US media have responded with fury to German offers of political asylum to fugitive leaker Edward Snowden . Many Germans who have expressed support for Snowden may be forgetting they have lived for years under the umbrella of US protection, say American critics. The German newspaper Die Zeit reflected the anti US-feeling in its cover this week which shows a US-German heart logo breaking apart above the headline 'Goodbye Friend!' Germany has also been accused of making a 'dangerous over-reaction' to allegations that security services bugged Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone . Writing on the US website The Daily Beast yesterday, commentator James Kirchick said: 'The hue and cry over American espionage illustrates just how out of touch many Germans are about the world, and their country’s place in it.' Mr Kirchick, who is based in Berlin, warned that 'welcoming Snowden…would risk a rupture in transatlantic relations more severe than anything caused by American spy methods'. It would also 'adversely affect Germany’s own internal security, which is heavily dependent upon the help it gets from the NSA and other American intelligence agencies', he said. He quoted an unnamed German intelligence official who this week conceded that 'without information from the Americans, there would have been successful terrorist attacks in Germany in the past years'. The crisis escalated after the German foreign ministry announced it had asked Britain to respond to a report that its Berlin embassy is being used as a covert listening post. The report claimed that documents from the US National Security Agency, together with aerial photos, suggest the British could be operating a spy station using equipment housed on the embassy roof.","Germany accused of making 'dangerous over-reaction' to spying revelations .

"Political paralysis in Washington sent stock markets falling around the world yesterday as the US braced itself for its first government shutdown in nearly 20 years. Barring an unlikely last-minute deal between Democrats and Republicans over the federal government budget, around 800,000 workers will go on temporary unpaid leave from today and millions more possibly forced to work for free. The last such shutdowns, over the winter of 1995 to 1996, lasted 28 days. Economists estimate a similar disruption now could cut US economic growth by 1.4 percent, costing the country as much as £1.25bn. Pledge: Barack Obama has vowed that the Republicans will not water down his healthcare reforms . But, far more worryingly, an impasse that lasts more than a week or two could scupper chances of Congress agreeing to extend government borrowing later this month. The US reaches its current borrowing limit in little more than two weeks. If the government is forced to default on its debt for the first time ever, the shockwaves would be felt around the world as US government bonds anchor the international financial system. A long government shutdown followed by a debt default would be 'the nightmare of the recession all over again', said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Wall Street analysts Moody’s Analytics. Jittery markets saw little to reassure them in fractious Washington yesterday where politicians prefered to bicker over who was to blame rather than negotiate a way to avert disaster. The bitterly divided factions in Congress had until midnight, when the government’s fiscal year ended, to reach agreement on a new budget bill. Standing ground: House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio walks to a House Republican Conference meeting to discuss the ongoing budget fight. He has said the party will not back down . Conference: President Obama speaks to the media in the briefing room of the White House on the looming government shutdown in Washington . Republican hardliners insisted it should include amendments to water down and delay Barack Obama’s controversial healthcare reforms, which begin to be implemented today. But the White House and the Democratic-controlled Senate refused to budge, accusing Republicans of allowing a small minority of Tea Party hardliners to hold the country to ransom. Both houses of Congress have to approve the budget. As it had warned, the Senate voted on Monday to strip out the Republicans’ health care amendments and sent back the government funding bill to the House with just hours before the deadline. Earlier in the day, Republican House Speaker John Boehner insisted they would not back down either. Crisis talks: President Obama speaks to members of his Cabinet. If a budget is not agreed the government will shutdown for the first time since 1995-6 . He pledged to keep fighting the implementation of so-called Obamacare, which aims to provide healthcare coverage to millions of uninsured Americans. Fellow Republicans blamed Mr Obama for the impasse, complaining he had ignored their pleas for talks and not contacted Mr Boehner in more than a week. Mr Obama has vowed that the Republicans will not water down his healthcare reforms and seems confident in polls that suggest his opponents will get most of the blame for a shutdown. According to a CNN poll, 69 percent said the Republicans were behaving like 'spoilt children' – compared to 58 percent who thought the same of the Democrats. Conflict: U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid leave a news conference while the deadlock over the budget continues . Mr Obama called on House Republicans to 'set aside the short-term politics', saying: 'We certainly don’t allow domestic policy differences, on issues that are unrelated to the budget, to endanger not only our economy but the world economy.' Under a shutdown, the State Department would continue processing foreign applications for visas, and embassies and consulates overseas would continue to provide services to American citizens. White House confidence was punctured yesterday by a 'fact check' by the Associated Press of the president’s health reform claims. It indicated that he was being 'slippery' about the real costs of getting insurance under his new system. The AP report tore apart his claim that most of the uninsured population would be able to get health insurance for less than the cost of their monthly mobile phone bill.","Around 800,000 public sector staff could be forced to go on unpaid leave .

"Barack Obama and Mitt Romney go to the polls neck and neck tomorrow after a final sprint through crucial states where the result – as in the country as a whole – is too close to call. Poll after poll over the weekend confirmed it would be one of the closest presidential elections in US history, putting the two White House contenders in a dead heat. The pair were neck and neck in four swing states which are likely to determine the winner of the White House, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. Scroll down for latest video . In profile: The winner is not determined by the nationwide popular vote but in state-by-state contests, making nine 'battleground' states very important in such a tight race . In one of the biggest prizes of the election, Ohio, Mr Obama has a slight lead over Mr Romney with 48 per cent compared to 44 per cent support among likely voters, the poll showed. On Saturday Mr Obama had been ahead by a point in the same poll. In Florida, another big prize, Mr Obama was on 48 per cent and Mr Romney on 46 per cent. Rally: Mitt Romney waves to the Republican faithful in Cleveland, Ohio, as he pushes for votes in the crucial swing state . In Virginia, Mr Obama leads Mr Romney 47 per cent to 46 per cent among likely voters. In Colorado, the candidates were tied. Nationally, 48 per cent said they would vote for Mr Obama and 47 per cent for Mr Romney. Given the closeness of the race, it means the result is now down to which party can ensure their supporters get to polling stations in the ten or so ‘battleground’ states. More than 27million people have already voted in 34 states and the District of Columbia. So far, Democratic voters outnumber Republicans in Florida, Nevada, North Carolina and Ohio. Republicans have the edge in only one swing state, Colorado, which Mr Obama won in 2008. Both sides said they were confident of victory as their candidates flitted back and forth across the US trying to fit in as many target states as possible. But in what Republicans claimed was an illustration of Mr Romney’s growing popularity – and Democrats said was a ‘desperate ploy’ to stave off defeat – the challenger has started targeting states that were previously seen as safely pro-Obama. Yesterday Mr Romney not only stopped off in swing states Virginia and Ohio, but also in Pennsylvania and Iowa, two states where Democrats have far more registered supporters. Speaking in Des Moines, Iowa, Mr Romney said the President had fallen short of his promises and vowed the country was ‘two days from a new beginning’ and ‘a better future’. He told supporters: ‘We’re Americans. We can do anything. The only thing that stands between us and some of the best years we can imagine is a lack of leadership – and that’s why we have elections.’ Making use of the presidential plane, Air Force One, Mr Obama was able to spend yesterday stopping off in four battleground states – New Hampshire, Florida, Ohio and Colorado. He has been joined in these final rallies by Bill Clinton, who has put aside his previous bitterness at the way Mr Obama deprived his wife Hillary of the 2008 party nomination. Joined by Mr Clinton in front of a roaring crowd in Concord, New Hampshire, Mr Obama once again tried to compare his economic policies with those of the previous Democrat President. Go-go Mr president: Supporters greet Barack Obama during a rally at McArthur High School in Hollywood, Florida as he criss-crossed America today . He said: ‘We have come too far to turn back now. We have come too far to let our hearts grow faint. It’s time to keep pushing forward.’ On Saturday night in Virginia, Mr . Clinton attacked Mr Romney’s habit of shifting positions on key issues, . saying: ‘He could be the chief contortionist for Cirque du Soleil.’ Despite . the narrow gap separating the candidates in most polls, Mr Obama is . clinging to a narrow lead in a majority of swing states. Most pundits . suspect this will give him a crucial advantage tomorrow. Attention remains focused on one battleground state above all others. According to the number crunchers, Mr Romney will find it very difficult to win the 270 votes he needs in the electoral college that decides the victor unless he carries Ohio. But polls have shown this midwestern state, many of whose voters rely for jobs on a car industry which the President bailed out, remains in favour of Mr Obama by at least three percentage points. More than eight in ten voters across the globe would keep Mr Obama as President if they had a say in the US elections, a major poll has found. The MSN survey of more than 570,000 people in 36 countries found that only 19 per cent favoured Mr Romney. The only country that preferred him was China, giving him 52 per cent of the vote. In Britain, Mr Obama took 85 per cent of the vote. n  Up to 40,000 people in New York will need to be rehoused in the wake of Superstorm Sandy.

"With his chiselled features, piercing blue eyes and a surname that opened just about any door in America, Robert Kennedy Jnr must have been all but irresistible to the women he tried to seduce. The fact he was married with children seems to have given neither him nor his many lovers pause for thought. Yet when he had bedded yet another woman, he would go home and write in a diary that the liaison constituted yet another ‘mugging’ — of him, not his companion. He also wrote that if he went a day without adultery it was a ‘victory’. A 2001 diary belonging to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , pictured with late wife Mary, has been unearthed that gives a stunning insight into the number of affairs he carried out during the same year that she gave birth to their fourth child . Unfortunately, there were far too few days when his ‘lust demons’, as he called them, did not win their battle. In . the extraordinary diary discovered by his wife shortly before she . committed suicide in grief over the break-up of their marriage, the son . of Bobby Kennedy — and the nephew of JFK — recorded serial philandering . which puts even the priapic ways of his presidential uncle in the shade. When . challenged by a journalist who had been handed the bombshell diary, . Kennedy, a 59-year-old former heroin addict, initially insisted it did . not exist, but yesterday belatedly admitted it was indeed his. Across . 398 pages, in puerile detail, the thick, red journal records his every . conquest during the year 2001 — and in the process becomes the latest . shameful chapter in the history of America’s most venerated yet most . dysfunctional family. Bad example: (from left) Brothers John, Bobby and Teddy Kennedy . Kennedy, pictured at his wife Mary's graveside in 2012 with their children, wrote in his 2001 diary about his feelings of guilt and remorse at repeatedly cheating on her . Part . self-flagellating Catholic mea culpa, and part smutty schoolboy . boasting, the diary includes a scorecard in which he recorded the names . of all the women he slept with, alongside a number between one and ten . denoting how far he went with each. The . numbers corresponded to sexual acts, with ten denoting intercourse. At . the back of the diary, in the section marked ‘cash accounts’, Kennedy . noted the names of all 37 women with whom he cheated on his wife that . year — 16 of whom got tens. They reportedly include a lawyer, a doctor, . an environmental activist and the wife of a famous actor. The shocking details were revealed by the New York Post, which has seen the diary.The . timing of his adultery was particularly awful. Not only did Mary give . birth to their fourth child in July of that year, but many of his . adulterous liaisons came at a time when the rest of America was deeply . traumatised by the September 11 attacks. It . seems even that horror was not enough to quash his addiction to sex, . which led Kennedy — on November 13, 2001, his diary reveals — to seduce . three women in a single day, although only one was a ‘ten’. Robert F. Kennedy Jnr with his late wife Mary Richardson Kennedy, left, in 2008 and, right, with girlfriend Cheryl Hines in 2011 . On . the same day, he mustered enough energy to squeeze in a charity . fundraising dinner at a Manhattan hotel, where he sat next to the . paralysed Superman star Christopher Reeve. That . month alone, as Kennedy travelled around the  U.S. for his work as an . environmental campaigner, he listed one woman’s name on 22 different . days. In May, he hosted a . dinner for Leonardo DiCaprio in New York, but ‘got mugged on my way . home’ — noting the woman’s name, and the fact she inflicted a ten on . him. ‘I’ve got to do better,’ he added, as though confessing to a . priest. Sometimes he . managed to resist. ‘I narrowly escaped being mugged by a double team . [two women],’ he related in a February diary entry. ‘It was tempting, . but I prayed and God gave me the strength to say no.’ Serial . adultery is a weakness among the testosterone-fuelled male Kennedys. Patriarch Joe Kennedy showed the way with his open affair with actress . Gloria Swanson, reportedly telling his sons — John, Bobby and Ted — to . get ‘laid as often as possible’. They dutifully obliged. It seems the infidelity gene has been inherited in a third generation. Even . to his diary, Robert Jnr couldn’t be completely honest. Despite Bobby . Kennedy’s own track record, his son comically insists he was ashamed by . what his father might think of his own philandering. And he makes clear . in the book that he is one of many younger Kennedys who have had trouble . living up to the family’s gilded ‘Camelot’ reputation. After his father was assassinated in 1968, Robert Jnr ‘struggled to be a grown up’, he told his diary.He . went on: ‘I felt he was watching me from Heaven. Every time I was . afflicted with sexual thoughts, I felt a failure. I hated myself. I . began to lie, to make up a character who was the hero I wished I was.’ Since when was having ‘sexual thoughts’ a sign of failure in the thrusting Kennedy family? Kennedy spent 30 days in a Puerto Rican jail alongside Rev. Al Sharpton in July 2001 after getting arrested for trespassing at a U.S. Navy training facility. But . the Irish-American clan has always been able to hide its transgressions . behind its supposedly staunch Catholicism, and Robert Jnr himself used . Biblical imagery to describe his own womanising. ‘Despite . the desperate things happening in the world, my life is . . . great,’ he wrote on November 5, 2001. ‘So I’ve been looking for ways to screw it . up. I’m like Adam and Eve, and I can have everything but the fruit. But . the fruit is all I want.’ On . another occasion, he told himself to be ‘humble like a monk. Keep your . hands to yourself. Avert your eyes’. He should avoid women, he added, as . he didn’t have the strength to ‘resist their charms’.When he spent a . month in a Puerto Rican jail over his involvement in a protest against . U.S. bombing exercises on a local island, he told his diary: ‘There’s no . women. I’m happy!’ On the . eve of being released, he claimed he had a ‘three-point plan’ to fix his . ‘greatest defect . . . my lust demons’. Such high hopes appeared to . last little more than two weeks before he was again recording the names . of women he had seduced. The . infidelity in the 2001 diary alone would be enough for any philanderer, . but inevitably it was only one chapter in Kennedy’s  bed-hopping . lifestyle. H  is serial adultery was cited ten years later in the breakdown of his marriage to Mary, whom he had known since she was 14. They . also shared a history of alcoholism, which Robert Jnr compounded with a . drug problem, being convicted of heroin possession in 1983. Mary was . pregnant with their first child when they married in 1994, just a few . weeks after he divorced first wife, Emily. Robert Kennedy, far left, photographed in 2001 at a charity event for the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation. According to his secret diary, Kennedy had dalliances with three different women, including intercourse with one, during the evening . Kennedy . — who has talked in the past about running for the U.S. Senate — . clearly regards himself as a public figure. He has endorsed various . Democrats in presidential campaigns and appeared in an ad campaign for . Hillary Clinton. Yesterday, he faced further embarrassment as the New . York Post published what he revealed in his diary about fellow public . figures. Robert Jnr, who . has positioned himself as a lion of the Liberal-Left, described George . W. Bush as ‘an idiot and a puppet’ a day after 9/11. But . he was equally damning of black allies on the Left. Civil rights . activist and presidential contender Al Sharpton was a ‘buffoon’ whose . ‘venal blackmail and extortion schemes taint all black leadership’. Fellow civil rights firebrand Jesse Jackson was, he wrote, a publicity . addict who made him feel ‘dirty’.The Kennedy brand remains so strong . that Robert Jnr will be forgiven his political posturing in time, but . his sexual antics will be rather harder to sweep away. His . compulsive infidelity is particularly damning given that the Kennedys . have been in a bitter dispute with his wife’s family over the . circumstances of her death. Mary . was found hanged in a garage at her home in Westchester County, outside . New York, in May last year. She had been struggling with depression, . alcoholism and financial problems as she fought a vicious divorce and . child custody battle with her estranged husband. The . year before her death, the Kennedy camp leaked a shocking court . affidavit from Robert Jnr in which he asked for a protection order . against his wife. Kennedy . claimed she had been violently abusing him since they married, and once . — in a rage about his friendship with his ex-wife Emily — hit him in . the face, her engagement ring crushing his tear duct and causing . permanent damage. But even . he implied she was justified in telling their children he was a ‘sex . addict’. By 2001 — the year covered by the diary — he was ‘committing . numerous infidelities to keep my sanity’, he admitted in the affidavit. After . Mary’s death, Kennedy —who was dating the actress and Curb Your . Enthusiasm TV star Cheryl Hines at the time — said his wife had phoned . him the day before her death pleading for help. ‘She told me that she was sorry for everything . . . that everything was her fault,’ he told police. But . her family were so appalled by his behaviour towards her that they . insisted on holding a separate memorial service, from which the Kennedys . were excluded. We now know . at least partly what might have sent Mary Kennedy out of her mind — . even, according to their housekeeper, once attacking her husband with a . pair of scissors as he sat in the bath. Some women would say he was . lucky she didn’t kill him, given the way he behaved. The . ‘curse of the Kennedys’ may have become a part of American folklore, . but from the evidence of Robert Jnr’s self-pitying diary, no one . believes in it more than the family does.","When he had bedded yet another woman, he .

"Former world heavyweight champion Ken Norton, who broke Muhammad Ali’s jaw when they fought in 1973, has died at the age of 70. Norton, who passed away from heart failure at a Las Vegas nursing home, had been in poor health after a series of strokes. The former US marine, who was only the second man to ever beat Ali, had an unconventional boxing style that saw him rise through the ranks to battle some of the era’s greatest fighters, including George Foreman, Joe Frazier and Larry Holmes. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ken Norton breaks Muhammed Ali's jaw in San Diego, 1973 . No longer with us: Ken Norton, left, and Larry Holmes battle in 1978 for the WBC heavyweight championship at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. His . famous victory over Ali, which came at the height of the champion’s . dominance of the sport, was followed by two further bouts, becoming one . of the great rivalries in boxing history. Norton lost both rematches, . but only by the slimmest of margins each time. Norton’s . unorthodox style – coming in close and jabbing from below rather than . above, and using a cross-armed defence – took many of his opponents by . surprise. He was eventually crowned the World Boxing Council’s champion . in 1977, but only because the holder, Leon Spinks, decided to fight Ali . instead of facing Norton, who was the mandatory challenger. He . lost his title by just one point to Larry Holmes in a famously bruising . 15-round heavyweight title fight in 1978, which has gone down as one of . the greatest bouts in boxing history. The . defeat effectively ended Norton’s career and he switched to acting, . appearing in some 20 films and episodes of the TV series Knight Rider . and The A-Team. Smash!: Muhammad Ali, right, winces as Ken Norton hits him with a left to the head during their 1973 re-match . He was almost killed in a car crash in 1986 and wore a fedora to hide the scars. Mike . Tyson, who visited Norton in hospital before his death, said: ‘Ken . Norton was always nice to me even when I was just an amateur fighter. He . always treated me like I was somebody. Remarkable man.’ Wham!: Muhammad Ali, right, takes a hard left from Ken Norton during their 1973 re-match - Norton won their first fight, and famously broke Ali's jaw . Ali's former business manager Gene Kilroy said Norton had been in poor health for the last several years after suffering a series of strokes. 'He's been fighting the battle for two years,' he said. 'I'm sure he's in heaven now with all the great fighters. I'd like to hear that conversation.' Focused: Ken Norton, right, follows through with his right against Larry Holmes misses during their heavyweight championship fight in Las Vegas. Kilroy also revealed Ali and Norton never had any animosity toward each other and became good friends over the years. Still, Norton always thought he had won all three fights. His son Ken Norton Jr was a linebacker for 13 years in the NFL, playing for Dallas and San Francisco, and coaches the position for the Seahawks. He and his father were estranged for a time in the 1990s before finally reconciling. Norton always gave his father credit for his career, saying he learned how to train hard by watching him go for early morning runs when he was a child. The biggest of stages: Ken Norton, left, and heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali trade right punches in the late rounds of their 1976 title fight in New York's Yankee Stadium . 'It's been noted that my father and I are on speaking terms and everything's back together now,' Norton Jr. said in 1995. 'It's part of what I do. No matter what I do, I can't get away from boxing.' Norton, was born on August 9, 1943, in Jacksonville, Illinois, started boxing when he was in the US marines, and began his pro career after his release from duty in 1967. He lost only once in his early fights but had fought few fighters of any note when he was selected to meet Ali. At the time, Ali was campaigning to try to win back the heavyweight crown he lost to Joe Frazier in 1973. After that bruising first bout, they faced off two more times, including the final fight at Yankee Stadium on a night when police were on strike and many in the crowd feared for their safety. The fight went 15 rounds and Ali won a decision. Later in life: Former boxer Ken Norton arrives for the 2001 premiere of the film ""ALI"" at Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood . Norton was badly injured in a near fatal car accident in 1986. He recovered but never regained his full physical mobility. 'The . doctors said I would never walk or talk,' Norton said at an autograph . session in 2011 in Las Vegas, lifting his trademark fedora to show long . surgical scars on his bald head. Kilroy said Norton was visited at the hospital by former fighters, including Tyson, Earnie Shavers and Thomas Hearns. Norton fought only five more times after losing his title to Holmes. His final fight came November 5, 1981, when he was knocked out in the first round by Gerry Cooney at Madison Square Garden.

"Historian Niall Ferguson has been labelled a homophobic 'pub bigot' for suggesting that the economist John Maynard Keynes didn't care about future generations because he was gay and childless. Professor Ferguson quickly issued an abject apology, insisting that his 'stupid and insensitive' remarks at a conference had been 'off the cuff'. But he failed to mollify critics, with one claiming yesterday that the Scottish-born Harvard academic had made similar remarks about Keynes's sexuality before. 'Stupid and insensitive': Harvard historian Niall Ferguson, left, has apologised for suggesting the economist John Maynard Keynes, right, did not care about the future because he was gay and childless . Professor Ferguson, 49, an advocate . of austerity policies, had tried to use Keynes's famous observation that . 'in the long run, we are all dead' against him in a sideswipe at the . British economist's 'selfish' support for high government spending. He was apparently responding to a . question about the contrast between the economic philosophy of . self-interest of Keynes, who died in 1946, and that of Edmund Burke in . the 18th century who believed there was a social contract among the . living, the dead and those yet to be born. Controversy: Niall Ferguson with his wife Ayaan Hirsi Ali . According to a report of his address . to financial advisers and investors in California on Thursday, during a . post-speech question and answer session Ferguson asked  his audience how . many children Keynes had. He then explained that Keynes married . a ballerina but had a string of gay affairs. Keynes was an 'effete' member of society who would rather talk of poetry than procreate, . Professor Ferguson reportedly added. Commentators rounded on the . historian, who has four children from two marriages, for implying that . gays or people with no children do not care about future generations. Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell . said he was glad the professor had apologised for his 'homophobic slur' against Keynes. But he added: 'His remarks are what we might expect from . a pub bigot, not from a Harvard history professor.' Tom Kostigen, a financial writer who . was in the audience, said: 'Apparently, in Ferguson's world, if you are . gay or childless you cannot care about future generations nor society.' Professor Ferguson said: 'I made . comments about John Maynard Keynes that were as stupid as they were . insensitive. I should not have suggested – in an off-the-cuff response . that was not part of my presentation – that Keynes was indifferent to . the long run because he had no children, nor that he had no children . because he was gay. It is obvious that people who do not have children . also care about future generations.' He insisted his disagreements with . Keynes have never had anything to do with the latter's sexual . orientation, and went on: 'As those who know me and my work are well . aware, I detest all prejudice, sexual or otherwise.' 'His remarks are what we might expect from a pub bigot': Peter Tatchell said it was 'shocking' that a history professor had made a 'homophobic slur' against the economist John Maynard Keynes . The professor admitted he had . 'forgotten' that Keynes's wife, Russian ballerina Lydia Lopokova, became . pregnant with his child in 1927 but miscarried. Cambridge University economist . Michael Kitson attacked Professor Ferguson's 'empty' apology, saying on . Twitter: 'These were not ''off the cuff'' remarks. I heard him make the . same over 20 years ago at a history seminar he gave at St Catherine's . College, Cambridge.' Others flagged up a passage in . Professor Ferguson's 1999 book The Pity of War in which he said Keynes's . sex life went 'into a decline' during the Second World War 'perhaps . because the boys he liked to pick up in London all joined up'. Keynes, hailed by Time magazine as . one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century, has influenced . generations of politicians with his argument that governments should . steer the economy through downturns rather than rely on the free market. He was open about his many homosexual affairs. Professor Ferguson, who says he . turned to Thatcherism as a student at Oxford, has a reputation as a . defender of western imperialism but has attracted controversy before. In 2011 the historian and broadcaster . threatened to sue a book reviewer who the professor said had accused . him of being a racist. He and his second wife, the Somali-Dutch writer Ayaan Hirsi Ali, have a 17-month old son.","Prof. Ferguson suggested Keynes did not care about future generations .

"The sex scandal engulfing former CIA chief David Petraeus and America’s commander in Afghanistan deepened yesterday when it emerged the two men had personally intervened in a messy child custody battle. While supposedly focused on the anti-terror agenda, two of the leading figures in the US security machine were writing glowing letters in support of the twin sister of the woman at the heart of the scandal. The revelation in court documents of their intervention on behalf of Natalie Khawam – a woman a judge had ruled psychologically unstable – fuelled speculation over the extent of their involvement with her sister, Florida socialite Jill Kelley. Friends in high places: (from left) Natalie Khawam  David Petraeus, Scott and Jill Kelley, and Holly Petraeus watch the Gasparilla parade from the comfort of a tent on the Kelley's front lawn . Twins: Natalie and Jill Kelley (formerly khawam) in their high school yearbook . David Petraeus (left) and General John Allen (right) both gave letters of reference to help Natalie Khawam's battle for child custody . And in another twist in the affair, it was   reported that General John Allen, the US commander in Afghanistan, sent emails to Mrs Kelley that were so explicit they were akin to ‘phone sex’. Allen, 58, is under investigation by the Pentagon over up to 30,000 pages of messages of allegedly ‘inappropriate communication’ between him and 37-year-old Mrs Kelley, a married mother of three. She has been portrayed as a flirtatious, cunning social climber who assiduously cultivated both Allen and Petraeus, a four-star general who became CIA director in September 2011, and other senior officers while they were stationed at a base near her home in Tampa. A former intelligence officer claimed yesterday that she even browbeat a special forces admiral into allowing her to jump with America’s top paratrooper commandos. ‘Do not ever bring that lady back here again,’ the parachute team leader said afterwards, according to the source. And she was clearly equally determined to call in favours from the top brass when it came to helping her troubled twin. Jill Kelley is under investigation by the Pentagon for her 'inappropriate emails' sent to General John Allen . A judge last year awarded Miss Khawam’s ex-husband custody of their three-year-old son, John, and ordered her to pay his legal bills of £221,000. Judge Neal Kravitz rejected her claims she had been a victim of domestic violence, criticising her ‘pattern of misrepresentations about virtually everything’. The judge also condemned Mrs Kelley’s testimony that she had seen her brother-in-law push her sister down the stairs while clutching their baby, describing her as a ‘patently biased and unreliable witness’. Miss Khawam, a lawyer, filed for bankrupcty in April after racking up £1.9million in debt and moved in with her sister and brother-in-law Scott, a cancer surgeon. Little more than a week after a terrorist attack on the Benghazi consulate in which the ambassador to Libya was killed in September, Mrs Kelley’s friends in high places found time to back her sister in her legal battle. Using his old title of ‘general’ and an envelope  embossed with four gold stars, Petraeus, 60, gushed in his letter to the court that ‘Natalie clearly dotes on her son and goes to great lengths – and great expense – to spend quality time with him’. Whenever he and his wife, Holly, had seen the pair, including when they had them over at Christmas last year, they had seen a ‘very loving relationship’. Writing two days later on September 22, Allen – Petraeus’s deputy when they were  stationed at Central Command on MacDill Air Force Base – said: ‘Natalie clearly loves John and cherishes each and every opportunity she has to spend time with him.’ Petraeus resigned last Friday after admitting he had been having an affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell. The pair’s relationship was exposed after Mrs Kelley went to the FBI after receiving anonymous harassing emails. Investigators discovered not only that they had come from Mrs . Broadwell but also that she was having an affair with the CIA chief.But they also learnt that Mrs Kelley was exchanging thousands of what officials call ‘potentially inappropriate’ emails with Allen, who is married with two children. In fact, he, too, had been emailed by Broadwell who warned him to stay clear of Mrs Kelley as she was a ‘seductress’. Allen’s appointment as Supreme Commander of Nato forces in Europe has been put on hold while the Pentagon investigates the extent of his relationship with Mrs Kelley. Yesterday Fox News said the pair became involved in much more than ‘flirtatious’ behaviour and quoted an insider saying the messages they exchanged were the ‘equivalent of phone sex over email’. Last night Barack Obama said he was ‘withholding judgment’ on whether the FBI should have told the White House much earlier about its Petraeus inquiry. Praising his ‘extraordinary service’ to his country, Mr Obama added: ‘By his own assessment, he did not  meet the standards he felt were necessary as the director of the CIA.’","CIA chief David Petraeus and General John Allen wrote letters of support for 'unstable' Natalie Khawam .

"A huge yellow diamond snatched in a £13million jewellery raid in London has resurfaced in a Hong Kong pawn shop. Armed robbers took the 16-carat stone, valued at £1million, in an audacious heist on the Graff jewellers in Sloane Street in 2007. Arriving in a £118,000 chauffeur-driven Bentley Continental, the two robbers – one wearing a panama hat and the other a beige suit – were allowed into the store by security staff. Some of the diamonds stolen during the hold-up in London in 2007. It has now emerged that a 16-carat yellow diamond taken during the raid has appeared in a Hong Kong pawn shop . The raid was carried out by a pair of sharply dressed thieves who arrived in a $250,000 Bentley Continental Flying Spur . London store: 'Graff is and was the true owner of the diamond and entitled to immediate possession of the diamond,' but the pawn shop won't let the institute return the gem, the lawsuit says . They chatted briefly to the . assistants before pulling out a pair of silver handguns and grabbing . handfuls of rings, necklaces, earrings and diamonds. The stockily-built men, aged between 40 and 55, then fled in the waiting Bentley. The case has never been solved and the yellow diamond is understood to be the first item in the haul ever to be located. The Hong Kong pawn shop claims it paid around £250,000 in 2010 for the stone, which had been recut after it was stolen. They then sent it to the Gemological Institute of America in New York for appraisal. Safe keeping: Until the outcome of the lawsuit has been decided, the diamond is being held at the Gemological Institute of America in New York City . However, institute staff had . certified it before and recognised the diamond as one of the stolen . Graff gems. The London jewellers are now suing for the diamond’s . immediate return at Manhattan’s state supreme court in New York. Graff says it is the diamond’s  ‘only rightful owner’, but claims the pawn shop will not let the institute return it to them. Sam Hung, a director at the Yau On pawn shop in Hong Kong, said he was not aware the diamond was stolen when the shop bought it. ‘When I received the diamond, I had . documentation about where I bought it but I had no method of knowing the . source (of the diamond),’ he said. ‘But we did pay for it – we’re a pawn shop. We are now negotiating.’ Graff has suffered a string of high profile robberies in recent years. In May 2003, a Serbian gang known as . the Pink Panthers stole jewellery worth £23million from its flagship . store in New Bond Street. The branch was targeted again in 2009 when gems worth £40million were stolen in one of Britain’s biggest jewellery robberies. Four men, who robbed the shop wearing suits and heavily disguised with make-up, were later jailed for up to 23 years.","Pawn shop owner paid $386,000 for gem which was part of $39million haul .

Israel argues that a lasting settlement can be brought to the war-torn region only by face-to-face negotiations. That view is shared by Mr Blair, who said UN recognition would do nothing to advance Palestinian independence. ‘You can pass whatever resolution you like at the United Nations or the Security Council, it doesn’t actually deliver you a state on the ground in the West Bank and Gaza, and if you don’t have a negotiation, whatever you do at the UN is going to be deeply confrontational,’ the former PM said yesterday. Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said his country was 'willing to make painful compromises' But there was no such obvious opposition from David Cameron, who has yet to make clear whether he will oppose the move. Earlier this week the Prime Minister said: ‘We support Palestine having its own state next to a secure Israel. ‘In the end we have to recognise we . will get a Palestinian state alongside an Israeli state by the . Palestinians and the Israelis sitting down and talking to each other.’ On the UN action, he added: ‘We don’t . yet know what resolution is going to be put forward, what it is going . to say, what its terms are. ‘There will only be one test for . British policy, which is: Will this help to bring about the . establishment of a state for the Palestinians next to a secure state for . Israel?’ Even as Mr Abbas spoke yesterday, tensions were running high in the West Bank. As Israeli troops and protesters . exchanged rocks and rubber bullets in the West Bank, Mr Abbas was . greeted with rapturous applause as he addressed a sympathetic UN general . assembly in New York. ‘The time has come for the Palestinian spring, the time for independence,’ he said. ‘The time has come for our men, women . and children to have normal lives. For them to be able to sleep without . fear of what the next day will bring. ‘It is time for the Palestinian people to gain their freedom and their independence.’ Negotiations with Israel 'will be . meaningless' as long as it continues building on lands the Palestinians . claim for their state, Mr Abbas declared, warning that his government . could collapse if the construction persists. 'This policy is responsible for the . continued failure of the successive international attempts to salvage . the peace process,' said the president, who has refused to negotiate . until the construction stops. 'This . settlement policy threatens to also undermine the structure of the . Palestinian National Authority and even end its existence.' To . another round of applause, he held up a copy of the formal membership . application and said he had asked UN chief Ban Ki-moon to speed up . consideration of his request to have the United Nations recognise a . Palestinian state in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. He concluded his speech by saying, 'We have one goal: to be. And we shall be.' He received a standing ovation at the end of his speech, and his jubilant mood was matched . by the exuberant celebration of thousands of Palestinians who thronged . around outdoor screens in town squares across the West Bank on Friday to . see their president submit his historic request for recognition of a . state of Palestine. President Barack Obama and Mr Abbas are seen during a meeting in New York on Wednesday . 'I . am with the president,' said Muayad Taha, a 36-year-old physician, who . brought his two children, ages 7 and 10, to witness the moment. 'After . the failure of all other methods we reached a stage of desperation. Mr Abbas was followed to the podium by Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who  said his . country was 'willing to make painful compromises.' Mr Netanyahu said: 'I extend my hand to the Palestinian people,' adding that he wanted a 'just and lasting peace' with Palestine. But he opposed the bid for statehood, warning that it would inflame the situation. 'I extend my hand to the Palestinian people, with whom we seek a just and lasting peace,' he said, to long applause. Palestinians, . he added, 'should live in a free state of their own, but they should be . ready for compromise' and 'start taking Israel's security concerns . seriously.' Mr . Netanyahu offered to meet Mr Abbas in the Palestinian city of Ramallah, . but added that he would be willing to meet for talks in New York . tonight. He said: . 'Who's there to stop us? What is there to stop us? I'll tell you my . needs and concerns, you'll tell me yours. And with God's help we'll find . the common ground of peace.' In Gaza, the ruling Hamas party criticised the request to the UN, claiming there were better ways to put pressure on Israel. The Islamist group said Palestinians should liberate their land by force and not ‘beg’ for UN recognition. The issue of recognising Palestine has . divided the international community, whose leaders are anxious not to . antagonise either side. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg admitted there had been debates at the top of British government over a response. The move is hugely symbolic for many Palestinians who have wearied of two decades of failed U.S.-sponsored peace talks. At the same time, they have grown alarmed by the continuing influx of Jewish settlers on to land they want for their state. Even if the UN recognises Palestine, . there will be few immediate changes on the ground: Israel will continue . to occupy the West Bank and east Jerusalem and to restrict access to . Gaza, ruled by Hamas militants. Security Council action on the membership request could take weeks or months. The strategy has put the . Palestinians in direct confrontation with the U.S., which has threatened . to veto their membership bid in the Council, saying that statehood can . only be achieved through direct negotiations between the parties to end . the long and bloody conflict. Violence: A Palestinian holds a slingshot as others roll tyres to burn during clashes with Israeli soldiers, at the Qalandia checkpoint between the West Bank city of Ramallah and Jerusalem . Religious unrest: Palestinian demonstrators carry a slingshot and rocks past a burning rubbish bin during clashes with Israeli soldiers . By seeking approval at a world forum . overwhelmingly sympathetic to their quest, Palestinians hope to make it . harder for Israel to resist global pressure to negotiate the borders of a . future Palestine based on lines Israel held before capturing the West . Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza in 1967. The U.S. and Israel have been . pressuring Council members to either vote against the plan or abstain . when it comes up for a vote. The vote would require the support of nine . of the Council's 15 members to pass, but even if the Palestinians could secure that backing, the U.S. says it will veto the move. The resumption of talks seems an . elusive goal, with both sides digging in to positions that have tripped . up negotiations for years. Talks broke down nearly three years ago after Israel went to war in the . Gaza Strip. A last round was launched a year ago, but broke down just . three weeks later. The . issue has divided the international community, with Israel and the U.S. strongly opposed and France trying to seek a compromise. Mr Blair, special envoy for the U.S., . UN, EU and Russia Quartet, said he was working day and night to find a . way of relaunching negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. He suggested Mr Abbas . did not need the statehood recognition to hold talks with Israel. 'When you actually get down to the . detail of territory, security, Jerusalem, refugees, water, all the . issues, to be absolutely frank about it, it doesn't make a great deal of . difference whether you are designating someone as a state or not a . state,' he said. 'The Palestinian Authority and President Abbas are perfectly able to negotiate with the Israelis.' He added: 'With the changes going on . in the region at the moment, there is a huge strategic interest on both . sides to get a credible negotiation going again.' U.S. President Barack Obama has also . pleaded with Mr Abbas to drop the application in case it causes further . violence in the region.","Israeli PM offers to meet Palestinian leader for talks in New York .

"Despite a number of high-profile gaffes, Mitt Romney still has the backing of middle-class voters in the race for the White House, according to a poll . Mitt Romney is winning the battle for middle-class voters in the race for the White House despite a string of gaffes. With even some Republicans turning on their candidate, there is a general perception in Washington that multi-millionaire Mr Romney is out of touch with ordinary Americans who believe he will only help the rich. But according to a poll, he has a 14 percentage point lead over Barack Obama among middle-class families. Although Mr Obama leads by three per cent overall in the poll, middle-class voters constitute 54 per cent of the electorate and are the ultimate target group in a presidential election. They are more inclined to favour the Republicans on a string of crucial issues, the Politico-George Washington University poll revealed. It found  62 per cent are more likely to believe America is on the wrong track, compared with 34 per cent who say it is heading in the right direction. They are also more likely than the . overall electorate to hold an unfavourable view of Mr Obama, with 51 per . cent holding this view. On . specific areas, 61 per cent disapprove of Mr Obama’s handling of . government spending, and 56 per cent are unimpressed by his handling of . the economy. Crucially for Mr Romney, there is little sign of any good economic news on the horizon. Scroll down for video . Mr Romney holds up a baby at a campaign rally in Pueblo, Colorado. He has a 14 percentage point lead over Barack Obama among middle-class families . The unemployment rate rose in August . in five of the ten swing states that should prove crucial in November’s . election. It dropped in only two of them. The . Obama campaign yesterday launched a TV advert condemning Mr Romney . after he was caught branding Americans who don’t pay tax ‘freeloaders’, . yet refusing to ‘come clean’ about his own financial arrangements. Mr . Romney, who ran private equity firm Bain Capital, has been scorned by . Democrats for refusing to reveal any tax returns before 2010. Romney's strong showing in the poll also comes after a series of gaffes on his campaign trail. Earlier this month, he was forced to . defend comments secretly recorded at a fundraising event in which he . said that 47 per cent of Americans are dependent on government... and who . believe that they are victims'. He added that 'my job is not to worry about . those people'. Mr Obama, appearing with first lady Michelle Obama on ABC Television show The View in New York, still leads by three points overall in the poll . Last month, he was left red-faced when he confused ‘Sikh’ and ‘Sheikh’ while talking about the massacre at a Wisconsin Sikh temple. The Republican Presidential candidate twice confused the two terms and referred to the victims as the ‘Shiekh people’ who had been worshipping in a ‘Sheikh temple’. Sheikh is a Muslim term for the leader of a tribe or village. He also forced into a humiliating U-turn during this year's Olympics when he said there were 'a few things that were disconcerting' about London hosting the Games. He was subsequently branded ‘Mitt the Twit’ and ‘Party Pooper’ by the British press and had to use a series of interviews to try to repair his damaged reputation on his first foreign trip as a presidential candidate. He has also previously been condemned for saying he likes 'being able to fire people who provide services to me'.

"Iraqi forces retook a key strategic town from Islamic State militants today in a victory that has been hailed as a possible turning point in the fight against jihadis overrunning the country. Barwanah, in Iraq's Anbar province, has been gripped by vicious fighting for months since IS fighters overran the region last December. But yesterday, after American warplanes carried out strikes in the area, Iraqi troops finally broke through IS defences as part of a major operation  to wrest back the province from the clutches of the extremist horde. The news came as key Arab allies vowed to 'destroy' the Islamic State 'wherever it is' and do more to stop radical jihadists journeying from their homelands to join the 'holy war' waged in Iraq and Syria. And in a further boost to the fight against IS in Iraq and Syria, France today pledged to join America's airstrike campaign as president Francois Hollande made the first visit by a foreign head of state since the extremist group took hold. Scroll down for video . 'Not staying': An Iraqi man scribbles over graffiti on the wall reading in Arabic, 'the Islamic State  is staying' after IS fighters were driven out . Major victory: Iraqi army vehicles drive through Barwanah in the Anbar province, after government forces backed by militiamen retook the town from Islamic State (IS) fighters . Contested: Barwanah is at the heart of a hotly-contested area in western Iraq . The ten Middle Eastern allies, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon, made the announcement to crush the IS insurgency following a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in the Red Sea coastal city of Jiddah. But the summit was held under a shadow yesterday after Nato member Turkey refused to join in, signaling the struggle the U.S. faces in trying to get front-line nations to put aside their regional animosities and work together to defeat a common enemy. But despite Turkey's refusal to support the drive, the fight against the Islamic State was nonetheless given a boost today as France vowed to join the U.S. campaign of airstrikes in the country. The Arab states' endorsement of a broad strategy to stop the flow of fighters and funding to the insurgents, and possibly to join military action, came as the CIA doubled its assessment of how many fighters the extremist group can muster. Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress lined up on Thursday behind President Barack Obama's call to combat the militants. Gripped by violence: Barwanah, in Iraq's Anbar province, has been gripped by vicious fighting for months since IS fighters overran the region last December . Mortars: Iraqi gunmen stand next to rebel-made mortar rounds left behind by Islamic State fighters in Barwanah after the town was won back . Mortars: The rounds would have been fired from a launcher like this, also captured from IS positions. They did so a day after he laid out a long-term campaign that would include expanding airstrikes against the fighters in Iraq, launching strikes against them in Syria for the first time and bolstering the Iraqi military and moderate Syrian rebels to allow them to reclaim territory from the militants. Kerry's visit, on the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, was aimed at pinning down how much support regional allies are willing to give to the U.S. plan to beat back the Islamic State group, which has seized large chunks of Iraq and Syria. Nearly 40 nations have agreed to contribute to what Kerry said would be a worldwide fight to defeat the militants. Summit: The news came as key Arab allies vowed to 'destroy' the Islamic State 'wherever it is' and do more to stop radical jihadists journeying from their homelands to join the 'holy war' waged in Iraq and Syria . The ten Middle Eastern allies made the announcement to crush the IS insurgency following a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in the Red Sea coastal city of Jiddah (pictured: Kerry with Saudi foreign minister Prince al Faisal (left) and his Omani counterpart Yussef bin Alawi bin Abdullah (right) Ruthless: Greater regional support is seen as critical to combatting the spread of the Islamic State group, which has proved so ruthless that even al-Qaida severed ties with it earlier this year . 'The devastating consequences of extremist hate remain fresh in the minds of all Americans, and to so many of our friends and allies around the world,' Kerry said of the terror attacks on the U.S. 13 years ago. 'Those consequences are felt every day here in the Middle East.' Also today, France promised to join the U.S.-led airstrikes targeting extremists in Iraq as part of an expanding international effort to combat the Islamic State group, Iraq's new prime minister said after talks with the French president on Friday. Haider al-Abadi's remarks came after talks with Francois Hollande, who was in Baghdad to bolster Iraq's new government as it struggles to unite the nation amid the rampage by the Islamic State group. 'In order to confront Daesh, we need aerial support from our allies,' al-Abadi said, referring to the group by its Arabic acronym. 'The French president promised me today that France will participate in this effort, hitting the positions of the terrorists in Iraq.' Iraq's new Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi, right, and French President Francois Hollande shake hands during a press conference in Baghdad.

Key visit: Mr Hollande  and Iraq's President Fouad Masoum  review the honour guards during a welcoming ceremony at Salam Palace in Baghdad, Iraq, in the first visit to the country by a foreign head of state since the Islamic State militant group seized large swathes of Iraq three months ago . Al-Abadi spoke at a joint press conference with Hollande in Baghdad. Neither of the two leaders provided details about when the French could join the aerial campaign. Hollande added that France has delivered four arms shipments and 60 metric tons (66 tons) of humanitarian equipment to Iraq. But Western allies know the fight against IS cannot be won without greater regional support on the issue. New intelligence assessments estimate the extremists can muster between 20,000 and 31,500 fighters across Iraq and Syria, up from a previous figure of 10,000, the CIA said on Thursday. CIA spokesman Ryan Trapani said the new total reflects stronger recruitment by the extremists since June, following battlefield successes and the group's declaration of an Islamic state, or caliphate, on territory under its control. I have a plan: Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress lined up yesterday behind Barack Obama's call to combat the militants, a day after he laid out a long-term campaign to defeat IS . Mediation: The U.S. has been asked to act not just as a 'leader for its friends and allies', but also as a 'referee between Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Iran' when dealing with Iraq and Syria (pictured: Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud and John Kerry talk before the meeting . Only Turkey would not back the plans against IS, after it was asked to secure its borders to prevent oil smuggling out of Iraq and Syria and keep foreign fighters from heading in. But Ankara has been reluctant to take a prominent role in the coalition, in part out of concern for the 49 Turkish citizens who were kidnapped from the Turkish consulate in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul when it was overrun by Islamic State fighters in June. U.S. officials played down Turkey's absence from the communique, noting that the Turkish government is still extremely concerned about the fate of its diplomats. A senior State Department official predicted the U.S. will continue to work with Turkey to repel the insurgent threat, and said Ankara is in a difficult position as it tries to protect the hostages. The official was not authorized to discuss the sensitive negotiations by name and spoke on condition of anonymity. Squabbling among Washington's allies in the region has complicated efforts to present a united front to beat back the militants. Saudi Arabia, the Emirates and Egypt are at odds with Qatar and Turkey because of the latter two countries' support for the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist groups in the region. Egypt's foreign minister, Sameh Shukri, emphasized that rift in his opening remarks, saying regional chaos is the result of a number of factors, including the tolerance of some in the region and the West for 'so-called political Islam' - a clear dig at supporters of the Brotherhood. American officials have voiced concerns too about the willingness of Kuwait and Qatar to crack down on private fundraising for extremist groups.","Iraqi forces retake Barwanah, in Anbar province, a key strategic outpost .

"Eighteen years after a teenager's naked body was found floating in a Utah river, police have arrested a convicted murderer thanks to DNA from a cigarette butt. Michael Simpson, 46, from Florida, is . being held on suspicion of aggravated murder in the killing of . 17-year-old Krystal Lynn Beslanowitch, whose bloodied and broken body . was found on December 6, 1995, along the Provo River in Utah. The lead investigator at the time, Wasatch County Sheriff Todd Bonner, flew to Sarasota County to help take Simpson into custody. After years of dead-end leads, DNA . technology improved and last January, investigators finally got a match . on Simpson from evidence at the scene, authorities said. Michael Simpson, 46, right, is . being held on suspicion of aggravated murder in the killing of . Krystal Lynn Beslanowitch, 17, left whose bloodied and broken body . was found December 6, 1995 . To corroborate the evidence, Bonner and . another detective flew to Florida on August 25, and were able to get a . new DNA sample from Simpson from a discarded cigarette after following him for days. Though it is not clear how or if the two knew each other, Krystal's mother told The Deseret News in 1996 that her daughter was involved with drugs and was prostituting by age 15. 'Every time she came home she had her arms spread out wide and a big smile on her face. I never refused her. I always loved her,' Linde Toreson said at the time. 'Whatever she was doing (she thought) was more important than living a normal life.' Krystal and her boyfriend had only moved to Utah from their home town of Spokane, Washington, just five months before she was killed. He reported her missing two days after she failed to return from a late-night trip to a Salt Lake convenience store. Bonner said at a news conference yesterday that he was thrilled at . the arrest, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. 'It's a case that's haunted me for . almost my whole career,' he said, adding that Krystal's parents  were 'relieved and emotional' at the news and happy it was moving forward. Previously, Simpson was charged with second-degree felony murder in 1987 and pleaded guilty two months later, according to Utah court documents. He was paroled from the Utah State Prison in April 1995, and was free at the time of Krystal's slaying, according to Utah Board of Pardons and Parole records.","Michael Simpson arrested and charged with murder after 18 years .

"Italy's new prime minister has come under fire for appointing female ministers for their beauty rather than their brains - an identical row to that which engulfed his playboy predecessor Silvio Berlusconi. Matteo Renzi, who came to power in February, has gone to lengths to distance himself from Berlusconi, who made no secret of his penchant for attractive young women, selecting a former glamour model to join his cabinet and cavorting with showgirls and models at his famous Bunga Bunga parties. But yesterday the Democratic Party leader was attacked by one of his most senior female politicians for doing the same thing for which 'Il Cavaliere' was ridiculed throughout his premiership. Popular: Maria Elena Boschi (left) has been the focus of much tabloid attention since becoming Minister for Reform, for her youth and photogenic looks as well as her figure-hugging business suits, while Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini's (right) looks have not gone unnoticed either in the Italian media . Pored over: Marianna Madia, the 34-year-old minister for public administration, is also regularly pored over by the Italian press . Rosy Bindi, a stalwart of the centre-left party and now president of a parliamentary anti-mafia commission, said: 'I believe some of the ministers were chosen because they are young and also good-looking.' After taking the reigns of government after an internal party coup seven months ago, 39-year-old Renzi - who is nicknamed Demolition Man for his no-nonsense approach to political reform - formed a new cabinet notable for its youth high proportion of female politicians. Among them is Maria Elena Boschi who has been the focus of much tabloid attention since becoming Minister for Reform, for her youth and photogenic looks as well as her figure-hugging business suits. But the 33-year-old hit back at Ms Bindi's claim yesterday, saying: 'I believe that we will be judged on how good we are, not how good-looking we are. We need to respond to the needs of ordinary people and that is what we are doing every day.' Attack: Rosy Bindi (right), a stalwart of the centre-left party and now president of a parliamentary anti-mafia commission said Matteo Renzi (left) had chosen some ministers 'because they are young and good-looking' Young cabinet: After taking the reigns of government  seven months ago, 39-year-old Renzi (centre) formed a new cabinet notable for its youth high proportion of female politicians. Eight out of 16 are women . She has surprised the stuffier corners of Italian politics in pushing through a complicated series of reforms to the country's Senate. She is not the only female politician to have attracted attention for reasons other than her work. Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini, 41, and Marianna Madia, the 34-year-old minister for public administration, are also both regularly pored over by the Italian press. But today, a number of other female politicians leapt to their defence, with one branding Ms Bindi's comments 'an old-fashioned way of looking at things.' Silvio Berlusconi raised eyebrows in 2008 when he appointed Mara Carfagna (right) as government spokesperson a year after saying of her: 'If I was not already married I would have married her immediately' 'Beauty has nothing to do with it,' deputy party secretary Debora Serracchiani told La Repubblica on Sunday. 'The ministers were chosen because they are competent and capable.' MEP Alessandra Moretti, another Democratic politician  whose looks have attracted attention, added: 'They've demonstrated that aside from their physical appearances, they are competent. In politics some people are afraid of a strong woman who is also good-looking.' Ms Bindi herself was once mocked by Berlusconi on national television when he called her 'prettier than she is intelligent' - a slight intended to imply that she is neither. Silvio Berlusconi became infamous in Italy  for his sexist gags, dalliances with teenage underwear models and debauched 'Bunga Bunga' that provided the world media's headline writers with a near unending flow of material throughout his premiership. In 2008, he raised eyebrows across Italian media and political circles when he appointed former glamour model Mara Carfagna as government spokesperson, a year after saying of her: 'If I was not already married I would have married her immediately.' He later made a grovelling public apology to his wife for 'wounding her dignity'. Mr Renzi's supporters have been at pains to make clear his attitudes towards women are in no way related to those of Mr Berlusconi.","Matteo Renzi came to power in February after staging internal party coup .

"Police and army bomb squads were called to a third suburban home in four days today as another military collector was arrested for keeping a stash of wartime guns, grenades and ammunition. Police raided the address of the 37-year-old, not yet named, in the village of Little Linford, Buckinghamshire, and discovered dozens of historic First and Second World War munitions. Controlled explosions were carried out at the semi-detached home, which had been sealed off by police searching for artefacts illegally dug up with the help of metal detectors and removed from heritage sites across Britain and Europe. Scroll down for video . A house in Little Linford, Buckinghamshire, was the latest house to be raided by police today as part of an operation targeting military collectors . The operation comes after two other military collectors were arrested in raids this week in St Albans, Hertfordshire, and Bicester, Oxfordshire by police cracking down on heritage crime. All three men were said to be among a group of enthusiasts and hobby collectors who tour former military sites in Britain and abroad looking for memorabilia. Hertfordshire Police, which is leading the probe, first raided the home of married father-of-two Alan Tissington, 48, on Wednesday and discovered a huge haul of bombs, artillery shells and a Vickers machine gun dating back to the First World War. Several controlled explosions were carried out by soldiers from the Royal Logistics Corp in a farmer's field two miles from his semi-detached home in the heart of suburbia. Mr Tissington was held on suspicion of theft and possession of firearms, explosives and ammunition, and later bailed pending further inquires. The following day saw 35-year-old Daniel Mackay's home raided in Bicester, Oxfordshire, where officers made similar finds. Daniel Mackay, 35, (above) was arrested on Thursday after police found a huge cache of munitions and weaponry at his house in Oxfordshire . Police officers and bomb disposal experts raided Mr Mackay's home in Oxfordshire this week . Army bomb experts performed controlled explosions in his back garden. He too was arrested on suspicion of theft from heritage sites and later bailed. Mr Mackay and Mr Tissington know each other through their hobby and have communicated with each other on Facebook. Mr Mackay was pictured on his profile wearing Army fatigues and posing with a machine gun, among his other finds. He also features in a macabre YouTube video shared by Tissington in June, entitled 'Exhumation of German soldiers in 2014 Kurland'. Mr Mackay is referred to as a military archaeologist in the video and is seen taking part in a dig at German war graves, which were believed to be in Latvia. Referring to the latest raid, a Thames Valley Police spokesman said an unnamed 37-year-old man from Little Linford was arrested on Friday on suspicion of theft from heritage and protected sites. Alan Tissington's property in Hertfordshire was also raided by police who found a cache of firearms and ammunition in the garage . Arranged against the far wall of the garage housing the memorabilia was a collection of artillery shells . Hand grenades, shell covers, incendiary bombs, and stick grenades were among the munitions discovered in Wednesday's raid . He was questioned overnight and was released on police bail until November 11, pending further inquires. Detective Sergeant Pete Frost, who was leading the case for Hertfordshire Police said: 'I can confirm that the Thames Valley incidents are linked to our investigation and the warrant that was executed on Wednesday in St Albans. 'Our investigation is ongoing and we will continue to liaise with Thames Valley Police and partners in English Heritage.' Supterintendent Jim O'Ryan, deputy area commander for Milton Keynes, added: 'An investigation is in progress in relation to the discovery of First and Second World War munitions at the property in Newport Pagnell. 'Experts with the relevant expertise are working together to deal with these items safely and any controlled explosions will pose no threat to the general public, who should not feel alarmed.' Sources close to the case said the men regularly visit European battlefields and ex-military sites in the UK with metal detectors. Mark Harrison, National Policing and Crime Advisor for English Heritage, said: 'The practice of illegal metal detecting or stealing artefacts from the ground, particularly from conflict sites relating to the First and Second World Wars, is an issue that English Heritage takes very seriously. 'We recognise that the majority of the metal detecting community comply with the laws and regulations relating to the discovery and recovery of objects from the land. 'We are prepared to take action and do what is necessary including, working alongside the police, to bring those responsible to justice.' Army explosive experts carry out a controlled explosion after evacuating a suburban street in St. Albans - where military collector Alan Tissington was arrested on Wednesday . Alan Tissington - the collector arrested on Wednesday - took to Facebook over the weekend to thank well-wishers. He wrote: 'Guys, just wanted to say a massive thank you, to all who have sent kind words and well wishes, it is greatly appreciated. 'Those of you that know me, know I am passionate about military history and militaria, which started at the age of seven. 'I am devastated that part of my life's work has now been destroyed, bearing in mind that the vast majority was purchased at respected military fairs and eBay.

The police raids saw enthusiasts start an online petition on Change.org calling for 'amendments and concise rules for the ownership/sale of military artifacts in the UK'. The petition, started by fellow collector Simon James on Friday, said: 'To: government stop making old war relics a crime to own.' It had been signed by 90 supporters by this afternoon. Michael Clayton, of Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, signed the petition and commented: 'This is a legitimate interest and hobby, no different from Government sponsored museums and collections. 'How would the recent WW1/WWII commemorations have been fully undertaken without many private collectors willing to share their items to educate the public? The government, surely, has better things to concentrate on?'","Police raid 37-year-old's home as part of operation targeting weapon haulers .

"Body image issues are the bane of women's lives: we worry about our weight, our skin, our hair - and  about the appearance of our vaginas, according to statistics on the growing popularity of labiaplasty. In the past decade, cases of genital cosmetic surgery have risen five-fold, with more than 2,000 women now having the procedure on the NHS each year. But not everyone wants to go under the knife in their quest for the perfect 'designer vagina' - so now, new non-surgical techniques are launching which promise the results of labiaplasty without the pain and recovery time. Lindsey, pictured with her husband William and baby boy Xavier, says she feels like she has her body back . Lindsey had a difficult experience during labour with her son (pictured) and needed extensive stitches after the birth . Business development manager Lindsey Price, 41, was unhappy with the appearance of her vagina, so tried out one new non-surgical procedure which claims to remodel labia left stretched by the trauma of childbirth using a combination of radio frequencies and ultrasound. Lindsey had a difficult experience during labour with her son and needed extensive stitches after the birth, which left her scarred, affecting both her confidence and sex life. As a result, Lindsey felt insecure and inhibited in the bedroom with husband William. 'I'd had a fairly uneventful pregnancy with my son Xavier, with the labour itself even being pretty low-key. 'It wasn't until the birth itself that the problems started - my son's head got stuck and I ended up having to have a ventouse [forceps] delivery. 'Unfortunately the suction device didn't work, and I was given an episiotomy as a last resort, leaving me with over 50 stitches and in a lot of pain.' 'Due to the cuts administered when giving birth, my inner and outer labia were a mess. I'd expected everything to heal and go back to normal, but I was left with an untidy looking area that made me feel self-conscious. 'My confidence, which prior to pregnancy had been high, vanished, and our sex life started to suffer.' Lindsey became aware of a new technology, which is due to be unveiled to the medical community this October and is a non-invasive option to the surgical intervention known as labiaplasty, which can cost over £3,000 and involves recovery time. This new technique remodels labia left stretched by the trauma of childbirth using a combination of radio frequencies and ultrasound. The FDA and CE-approved technique gives results in just four  sessions, and has been shown in clinical studies to also increase sexual libido. Lindsey says she now has renewed confidence in herself, and with husband William (left) Radio frequency skin tightening is not a new technique, but this is the first time that it has been used for the purposes of labia remodelling. The treatment takes just 12 minutes, during which a water-based gel is applied to the skin, and the device, which emits an electrical current, is applied to the skin of the labia. This current encourages the production of new collagen and elastin, which tightens the skin and enhances the appearance of the labia. Although a side effect of the application of radio frequencies and ultrasound is heat, it is not  uncomfortable. 'I was dubious when she told me it was both painless and fast-acting, so I was honestly gobsmacked when I started to see results after just one treatment. Lindsey, here with baby Xavier and husband William,  underwent a new non-invasive procedure to reverse the damage that childbirth had done, seeing results quickly, as well as an increased libido . 'I feel like I have my body back and my husband has his wife back,' Lindsey says triumphantly. 'Our sex life has improved ten-fold which I think is not only due to improved appearance and sensitivity down there, but also the renewed confidence it's given me. 'I've honestly never felt sexier and my libido is higher than ever.' Gynaecology and aesthetics nurse, Elizabeth Daley of Pureskin Clinic, Alderley Edge, where Lindsey had her procedure - says: 'Many women experience changes in their genitals that result in hypertrophy – an increase in volume – of the labia minora, either during puberty or later in life, perhaps following childbirth. 'This can result in psychological suffering as they feel they look abnormal, or they may experience physical discomfort during activities such as cycling or horse riding. 'Previously, invasive surgery was the only option, which can be painful and takes weeks to heal. Intima is a world-first, and we can now offer a simple solution, with minimal pain and no recovery time.' Paul Banwell, Director of the Banwell Clinic, a specialist in this field and British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons spokesperson, says: 'There is no doubt that labiaplasty surgery is on the rise . 'Suitable patients may derive significant physical and psychological benefits and I have personally seen huge patient satisfaction in my practice. However, it is a delicate procedure and it is imperative that patients are counselled properly and have access to a psychologist if required. 'The primary concern for most girls is stretching or enlargement of the labia and the best way to approach this problem is surgery. Furthermore, careful assessment of the anatomical variations is essential to implement a tailor-made plan. 'Radio frequency is excellent technology but it has its limitations and while this new machine seems attractive and may derive some benefit in a small minority, it is unlikely to address the majority of patient's concerns. I would be interested to see long-term results. 'I would definitely recommend patients contemplating labiaplasty procedures seek the help of an experienced plastic surgeon who specialises in this area' Intima will be available at the exclusive PureSkin clinic in Alderley Edge in Cheshire, and will be presented at the Clinical Cosmetic and Reconstructive Expo in London this October .","Lindsey had a difficult labour with first child Xavier .

"This September, the Prada SS15 show was one of the most talked about of Milan Fashion Week. But Miuccia Prada's new designs aren't the only thing to have got the clothes industry talking - the addition of 14-year-old model Roos Abels on the catwalk also raised several immaculately-plucked eyebrows. The decision to include the Dutch teenager in the show has reignited the debate about how what age models need to be in order to take part in these events. Scroll down for video . The age of 14-year-old Dutch model Roos Abels raised eyebrows at Prada catwalk show. Models under the age of 16 are not allowed at London or New York Fashion Week . Miuccia has a long history of using young models in both her catwalks and campaigns - she is responsible for kick-starting the careers of several unknown teens after casting them in her projects. The actress Hailee Steinfeld appeared in a Miu Miu campaign aged just 14 back in 2011, which was subsequently banned by the Advertising Standards Agency. American model Lyndsey Wixon was photographed for another Miu Miu campaign when she was just 15, and Kelly Mittendorf, Antonia Wesseloh, and Ondria Hardin were all 16 when they modeled for the Prada 2011 AW adverts. But since those days, several rules have been implemented in the fashion industry to prevent young models being used. The Prada show is considered one of the biggest and most popular of Milan Fashion Week . In 2011, the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) put a ban on any models under the age of 16 appearing on the catwalk at Fashion Week shows. The guidelines were taken so seriously that models showing up to walk the runways were often asked to bring ID to prove they were of working age. According to the Telegraph, in London there are no specific rules for model ages at Fashion Week, but all members of the Association Of Model Agents have  agreed not to sign any of their models under 16 years old up for these catwalk shows. After the Prada show (pictured) Roos Abels also walked in a second catwalk at Milan Fashion Week - the Giamba show . In an open letter to the fashion industry in 2011, CFDA  President Diane von Furstenberg summed up the argument for only using models over the age of 16 in catwalk shows. She said: 'The industry’s hiring of prepubescent-appearing teenage girls as models of adult clothing sets an unrealistic standard; hips and breasts, the curves that define the female figure, are absent. 'Some models have difficulty maintaining the body ideal as they move into adulthood and run the risk of engaging in unhealthy eating behaviors that lead to eating disorders.' MailOnline has contacted Prada for a comment.","The age of Dutch model Roos Abels raised eyebrows at Prada catwalk show .

"Forty-five Fijian peacekeepers were hailed as heroes today as they were released from captivity by Syrian al Qaeda-linked militants who kidnapped them on the Israeli border two weeks ago. The Fijians were captured on the Syrian-controlled side of the Golan Heights by fighters from the Nusra Front, who have been battling Syrian government forces in the contested buffer zone between Syria and Israel. And today their prime minister paid tribute to his 'heroic' troops who kept their cool under the 'most extreme circumstances imaginable.' 'Because of their discipline, not one militant was killed and none of our soldiers were harmed,' said Voreqe Bainimarama from Suva this morning. 'Heroes': Fiji's Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama called the peacekeepers heroes who kept their cool under the 'most extreme circumstances imaginable'. Fiji's army chief . 'No concessions': U.N. Spokesman Stephane Dujarric said 'no demands were made and no concessions were made' to secure the release of the peacekeepers . Released: The 45  Fijians were captured on the Syrian-controlled side of the Golan Heights by fighters from the Nusra Front on August 28 . Fiji's military chief described how his troops were released across the border at about midnight Fijian time, and were immediately given access to telephones to call their loved ones. By 2 a.m. every affected family in Fiji knew the good news, Brig. Gen. Mosese Tikoitoga told reporters. Then, he said, came the grog ceremony which, in Fiji at least, would mean drinking a potent local brew, kava, although the chief didn't say if that was the case. 'We could see the singing and drinking in the background, all the laughter, so they are all back to Fijian moods,' said Tikoitoga, describing a video call he had with his troops. 'And so I assume that all is well with them, at least emotionally.' The 1,200-strong U.N. force that has patrolled the zone since 1974 has increasingly been caught in the spillover from Syria's civil war, raising questions about the future of its  monitoring mission there. U.N. Spokesman Stephane Dujarric said 'no demands were made and no concessions were made' to secure the release of the peacekeepers. 'No ransom was paid,' he said. Fighting: The Nusra Front militants have been battling Syrian government forces in the contested buffer zone between Syria and Israel . 'No ransom paid': U.N. Spokesman Stephane Dujarric said 'no demands were made and no concessions were made' to secure the release of the peacekeepers, adding, 'No ransom was paid' Qatar, a chief backer of rebels fighting to topple Syrian President Bashar Assad, said it played a role in the release. The official Qatar News Agency reported that the tiny Arab Gulf emirate had 'succeeded in the release of the Fijian soldiers' in response to a request from Fiji for its mediation. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon thanked the efforts 'of all concerned' in the release, without naming anyone. He demanded that all parties respect the mandate of the U.N. force and the right of peacekeepers to move freely and safely, according to a statement from his office. The Fijian troops were captured on August 28, a day after militants seized control of the Syrian side of the Quneitra crossing from President Bashar Assad's troops. Two groups of Filipino peacekeepers were also trapped at separate U.N. encampments that day, surrounded by rebel fighters who demanded they surrender. They refused, and both groups eventually escaped - one busting out with the help of Irish colleagues, and the other by slipping away under the cover of darkness. Jordan's U.N. Ambassador Dina Kawar said the idea of peacekeepers being taken hostage 'is just impossible to accept because it will happen more and more, and that will make countries hesitant about sending their armies, so we were very happy.' Close watch: Syrian rebels from Al-Nusra Front surround buses carrying the peacekeepers during their release . Monitor: The 1,200-strong U.N. force that has patrolled the zone since 1974 has increasingly been caught in the spillover from Syria's civil war, raising questions about the future of its monitoring mission there . U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said the Fijians were released at the Syrian-side of the Quneitra crossing point near Israel and were 'in good condition.' He told The Associated Press that they crossed into Israeli-controlled Golan territory, were then taken to a U.N. post further north, and then went to Camp Faouar inside the Syrian-controlled Golan, where the peacekeepers stay. Israel's Channel Two news reported that the Fijians were given food and medical attention after crossing into Israeli-controlled territory. Fiji's U.N. Mission tweeted a photo of diplomats celebrating with their thumbs up, reading: 'Free at last! Thumbs up from the Fiji Permanent Mission in New York to our 45 brave Fijian UNDOF peacekeepers.' The mission, known as UNDOF, was established in 1974, a year after the Arab-Israeli war. For nearly four decades, U.N. monitors helped enforce a stable truce between Israel and Syria, but the spillover from the Syrian war has made troop contributors wary and several countries have withdrawn. Fiji's government, however, has said it has no intention to pull out. Dujarric, the U.N. spokesman, said 'my assumption is that the 45 would return home, and I hope they would be swapped out by new troops from Fiji.' UNDOF currently has troops from six countries: Fiji, India, Ireland, Nepal, Netherlands and the Philippines. UNDOF currently has troops from six countries: Fiji, India, Ireland, Nepal, Netherlands and the Philippines. The Fijian troops were captured on August 28, a day after militants seized control of the Syrian side of the Quneitra crossing from President Bashar Assad's troops . But after the latest abduction, Ireland said it would review its participation in the mission. The Philippines has given notice it will not deploy a new contingent when its already-extended stint ends in October. For the Philippines, the August incident was the third time its peacekeepers got caught up in the Syrian violence. Twenty-one Filipino peacekeepers were abducted in March 6, 2013 by the Syrian rebel group Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade, which held them for three days. Another group of four Filipinos was abducted by the Yarmouk rebels in May 7, 2013, and released five days later. In another abduction, armed men broke into a U.N. outpost in the buffer zone on May 15, 2013, and captured three unarmed military observers from the U.N. Truce Supervision Organization. They were held by the Syrian men for about five hours and released. Despite the difficulties, U.N. officials and diplomats have insisted that UNDOF's role is crucial to Middle East stability. U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power said last week that Syria's conflict 'only underscores how important it is for us to continue to have observers there monitoring disengagement.' U.N. peacekeeping chief Herve Ladsous has said UNDOF has been strengthened with armored equipment and other military hardware. The mission has reduced some patrols, but there has been no move to alter its mandate. Dujarric said the mandate is up for renewal soon and Ban will send Security Council members his report on the mission. 'So I'm sure it will give council members a chance to discuss the situation and the way forward as well,' he said.","Fiji's PM calls soldiers 'heroes' who kept cool in 'most extreme conditions'

"When Rebecca Saxon was diagnosed with thyroid cancer at the young age of 27, she thought her life was over. But in her darkest hour, inspiration struck and she found a way of turning her adversity into advantage. Following her cancer treatment, Rebecca launched a successful business 'Something Blue Bridal Shoes' - a unique range of wedding footwear, which emerged out of the fashion sketches she drew while recovering in her hospital bed. Scroll down for video . Rebecca Saxon was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2010. Over two years of treatment she sketched shoes in her notepad to keep from being bored. After being given the all-clear, she turned the designs into real shoes and now sells them through a new online business . Rebecca, from London, England, says: 'I started doing sketches of wedding shoes with blue soles when I was halfway through my cancer treatment. 'I had a hit a real low and was going through that whole ""Will I live or die?"" situation. 'But I decided that I was going to pick myself up and fight this cancer. The sketches were my release and the way I got through the many hours spent in a hospital room. 'It was incredible when I realized I could turn my footwear designs into a commercial business. 'After being given the all-clear, I set up SomethingBlueBridalShoes.com and I'm just so thrilled by how well the range has been received by customers.' Rebecca, 31, was working as a marketing manager when she discovered a lump in her throat in 2010. She explains: 'I immediately went to see my GP who referred me to a specialist who did a number of tests. Rebecca Saxon was diagnosed with Stage Two thyroid cancer and had to undergo two operations to remove ta lump and part of the gland, resulting in a scar on her neck (pictured) 'A few months along the line, the lump on my throat had got bigger, so I had to undergo surgery to get it and a small part of my thyroid removed. 'However when the results came back, they discovered that the lump was cancerous and I was diagnosed with Stage Two thyroid cancer. 'When I received that diagnosis, I was just in a state of shock. I didn't know if the cancer had spread or what the future would hold for me.' Following her diagnosis, Rebecca underwent a year-long intensive treatment which included two operations to have her thyroid gland removed, a course of hormone suppressants, further hospitalization and radiation treatment. She says: 'I had to take leave from work and I was in and out of hospital. Mentally I was in a very dark place, sitting in my apartment day-after-day. Rebecca has designed all of her shoes with a distinctive blue sole, to integrate the 'something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue' tradition . 'I had no idea what was going to happen to me. But I knew I had to be positive if I was going to overcome this treatment. I told myself this was not going to be the end for me. I decided to channel my negative feelings and start drawing. 'I had always loved fashion and when I was younger, I would sketch with my Nana. 'Several of my friends were getting married at the time so weddings were very much in the air. So initially, I would be drawing designs for bridal gowns and other garments. 'But then I started sketching wedding footwear - designing shoes with distinctive, blue soles which were super comfy too. I thought it would be a lovely way of integrating the 'something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue' tradition. 'Drawing really helped me deal with my treatment. 'But I also began looking at turning my sketches into commercial ideas and realised that I could make a living out of my bridal shoes. Rebecca now runs the business Something Blue Bridal Shoes . 'From then on, every time I went to hospital, I took my sketch pad and laptop. I would immerse myself in my sketches and thrash out different business ideas.' Rebecca was given the all-clear in August 2011. With the encouragement of her entrepreneur boyfriend, Mike Bandar, she then turned her dreams into her reality and set up 'Something Blue Bridal Shoes'. Each gorgeous shoe from the collection has a blue sole, incorporating the age-old tradition of what a bride should wear at her wedding for good luck. 'My doctors were great. Even though I will have to be on medication for the rest of my life, I feel so lucky to be alive today and running a business which I love.

One section does discuss the benefits for Hamas when civilian homes are destroyed. Today a 72-hour humanitarian truce is holding in Gaza, halting a month of war that has claimed more than 1,900 lives. Israel and the Palestinians have sent delegations to Cairo to discuss the possibility of a longer-term truce and a broader deal for the war-ravaged Gaza Strip. In the coming days, Egyptian mediators are to shuttle between delegations from both sides to try to work out a deal.

Some details have emerged about the negotiating points of Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza, including an internationally funded reconstruction that would be overseen by a Palestinian unity government led by President Mahmoud Abbas. The cease-fire is the longest lull in a war that has killed nearly 1,900 Palestinians. Israel has lost 67 people, including three civilians. Meanwhile, Norway is organizing a donor conference and the Western-backed Abbas is expected to take the lead in overseeing the rebuilding in the coastal territory, which his Fatah movement lost to Hamas in 2007. Meanwhile Israeli police have announced the arrest of a Palestinian man suspected of leading the group that kidnapped and murdered three Israeli teenagers in June.

The war broke out on July 8, when the Israeli military began bombarding targets in Gaza in an attempt to stop Hamas from launching rockets at Israel. On July 17, Israel sent ground troops into the densely-populated territory to destroy underground tunnels it said Hamas had constructed for attacks inside Israel. But in the weeks leading up to the war, Israeli-Palestinian tensions were soaring in the wake of the June killings of three Israeli teenagers, Naftali Frenkel, Gilad Shaer and Eyal Yifrach, whose bodies were discovered two weeks after they disappeared in the West Bank.

Israel rounded up hundreds of Palestinians in a bid to find the three while they were missing, also crushing the West Bank network of Islamist movement Hamas, which it accuses of abducting the teens, though there has been no claim of responsibility. According to Israeli media, Hossam Kawasmeh made it known during his interrogation that he received financial help from Hamas operatives in Gaza to recruit and arm the kidnappers. Israel accused Hamas of being behind the abductions, and subsequently carried out a massive ground operation in the West Bank, arresting hundreds of Hamas operatives as part of a manhunt. And in early July, an Arab teenager was abducted and burned alive by Israeli extremists in an apparent revenge attack. Six Jewish Israelis were arrested in that killing. On Wednesday, Israel's justice ministry confirmed that the suspected mastermind behind the killing of the three Israeli teens had been arrested in July.

You can fizz it into him and he will always take his touch forward, gets in behind their midfield and drives us on, which is very important. 'He is looking sharp.

"You can hear more from Collymore on Bleacher Report by clicking here. Wayne Rooney's best days are way behind him and Manchester United must look for a new captain, according to Stan Collymore. The pundit, formerly a striker with Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, believes the Red Devils frontman is past his best despite Rooney's recent claims that fans are yet to see the  him hit the top form of his career. Speaking to Bleacher Report, Collymore said: 'I think the best of Wayne Rooney unfortunately we've seen. That's natural, he's got a lot of miles on the clock. He came into the English game at 17, he's now (nearly) 29. Wayne Rooney is past his best and has a lot of miles on the clock, according to pundit Stan Collymore . 'For Wayne Rooney, I think his best years were probably playing alongside Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez. 'Do you not think that Wayne Rooney will ever get to 30 League goals, 25 goals again? I don't think so. 'Do I think the best is yet to come for Wayne Rooney? No not at all. I think that was three years ago, Collymore added. 'That doesn't mean to say that he can't be productive over the next two or three seasons because let's not forget he's a multiple Premier League winner, he's a Champions League winner, he's approaching 100 caps for England and is a very,very experienced and useful man to have in and around your team and your squad.' The 43-year-old also claimed Rooney isn't a natural athlete and compared the frontman to Real Madrid stars Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo, saying: 'He's not a natural athlete. If you were to put Wayne Rooney just in his underpants alongside Gareth Bale in his underpants, or Cristiano Ronaldo, you'd see the evolution of a professional footballer in terms of the physique.' Collymore believes Rooney's best football came playing alongside Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez . Rooney, who celebrated ten years at Old Trafford last month, was handed the captain's armband by new manager Louis van Gaal at the start of the season. However, when asked whether Rooney deserves to skipper Man United, Collymore said: 'I don't think Wayne Rooney or his representation have represented the best of Manchester United over the last four or five years.' 'For me, it would be a David De Gea, you very rarely hear anything of him other than being a very good goalkeeper.' 'Maybe Daley Blind could grow into the role but there are two things here: Should Wayne Rooney be thrown under the bus for being sent off? No, not really. Five years is a long time between sendings off. Should he be captain of Manchester United? No, I think Louis van Gaal should be looking elsewhere for the longer term.' Collymore believes Man United boss Louis van Gaal should look to appoint a different captain . Summer signing Daley Blind could grow into the role of captain at Old Trafford, Collymore also claimed .","Wayne Rooney is past his best, according to  Stan Collymore .

"Cleared: Ben Sullivan has called for the right of anonymity for those accused of rape . The president of the Oxford Union cleared of rape allegations has called for the right of anonymity for those accused of similar claims. Ben Sullivan, a third year university student, was on bail for six weeks after he was arrested over claims he raped one fellow student and attacked another. But on Wednesday, police informed the 21-year-old that no further action would be taken against him following an investigation. Last night, he said those accused of rape should have the right to anonymity until initial investigations had been carried out by police. Mr Sullivan also revealed he had struggled to deal with the fallout from the ‘poisonous allegations’. Speaking about his ‘harrowing’ experience on Newsnight, he said: ‘I’m not of the extremist [sort] who don’t think you should have your identity revealed until you’ve been convicted, or even necessarily after being charged. ‘What I don’t agree with though is that everyone’s identity is automatically revealed the minute they are arrested. ‘I think there should be some sort of happy medium whereby your identity is protected initially, until at least the conclusion of a preliminary investigation.’ Asked whether alleged rapists should be given anonymity but not those accused of other offences, he said: ‘That is completely true and why I would never say that everyone’s identity in the circumstances should be kept secret. ‘I’m completely aware that it can be extremely useful to police investigations for people’s identities to be revealed for people to come forward. ‘However, these are obviously incredibly poisonous allegations, they are incredibly difficult to deal with.’ Mr Sullivan’s arrest rocked the prestigious 200-year-old debating society, where many political leaders have cut their teeth. His arrest sparked a period of turmoil for the society as a boycott campaign from fellow students saw a host of high-profile speakers cancel their appearances. Ben Sullivan, a third year student at University of Oxford, was on bail for six weeks following rape claims . Speaking of the ordeal, he said: ‘It’s been very difficult, very harrowing. It puts things in perspective, changes your priorities to say the very least. I’m very thankful to everyone who has given me support - my friends, my family, and people at the union.’ A letter written by student politicians to around 30 speakers who had been booked to attend, asked them to boycott the Union, and Mr Sullivan to resign in what they called a ‘push for equality’. Nobel Peace prize winner Tawakkol Karman, a human rights activist, Interpol secretary-general Robert Noble, the US entrepreneur Julie Meyer and David Mepham, the UK director of Human Rights Watch, were all said to have pulled out of debates at the Oxford Union, citing concerns about Mr Sullivan’s arrest. But the banker’s son, who attended £22,000-a-year St Paul’s school in London, repeatedly defied calls to stand down as president while the police investigation was carried out. Student union official Sarah Pine who was the leader of the campaign to boycott the union also appeared on Newsnight and said she stood by the campaign. Mr Sullivan said: ‘I don’t doubt the organisers of the boycott have very good intentions and I do agree that sexual violence is a very serious problem at Oxford and other universities.’","Ben Sullivan, a third year university student, was on bail for six weeks .

The former Chelsea duo, who both left Stamford Bridge this summer, caught up at the Etihad Stadium and posed for a picture. Posting the snap  of the pair on Twitter on Wednesday morning, Cole added the message: 'Was soo good to see Lamps last night!! I wish him all the best at City and in New York. Such a goalmachine!!' Former Chelsea duo Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole were reunited after Man City's draw with Roma . Lampard and Cole embraced shortly after the full time whistle at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday night . Cole will have been the happier of the two Chelsea legends as Roma came away from England with a point . Chelsea released the former England stars last summer after the players' contracts expired . Shortly after the match Cole had tweeted: 'Strange feeling playing back in England and against Lamps!! Always tough to play City but great to get an away point.' Lampard is currently on loan at Manchester City having joined New York City FC  while Cole signed a two-year deal with Roma in July after both players were allowed to leave Chelsea at the end of last season.

"Back in hot water: Prince Harry during his holiday in Las Vegas, which has shocked the Royal family after he was pictured cavorting naked with women . The minders who were supposed to be protecting Prince Harry when naked pictures were taken 'acted like  amateurs who were asleep at the wheel', according to a source who was there. The Scotland Yard protection officers are said to have been 'enjoying the party' when the girls went back to Harry's suite at Encore in Las Vegas. Rather than asking the group to surrender their phones, the men sat back allowed the girls to take pictures while themselves joining in with the party, it is said. As one person photographed the Prince, an officer meekly told them 'awww, come on... no photos', according to TMZ, the U.S. website that brought them from one of the group. The source told the site that the minders 'were asleep at the wheel, enjoying the party more than protecting the Prince from himself'. They said that even when the drunken group had drank more alcohol and stripped naked,  pictures were being taken when the protection crew were around. 'Harry's team acted like a bunch of amateurs,' the source added. The Palace is understood to be furious that the photographs were allowed to be taken. According to experts working closely with VIPs, handlers usually insist that guests surrender their phones to prevent embarrasing kiss and tells. The 'breakdown in communication' was also slammed by former Royal Protection officer Ken Wharfe, who was known affectionately by the Princes as 'Uncle Ken' when he worked with Diana. Mr Wharfe said that given Harry had been involved in 'similar' episodes, more could have been done to prevent the naked pictures being taken. He added: 'The Commissioner will say ''hang on a minute, we haven't done anything wrong, he's alive so therefore the security is OK''. But it isn't because the people coming in are compromising  you and it's no longer an invasion of his privacy because you're inviting unknown people into your room.' Mr Wharfe, who was one of Diana's most trusted confidantes, called for changes to the Princes security to prevent unknown guests visiting him with phones. A Metropolitan Police spokesman refused to comment on the allegations. They told the Mail Online that they do not discuss matters of Royal Protection. Prince Harry arrived home yesterday to face the firestorm over the photographs of him cavorting naked with women, which have now been published on dozens of web sites. The Queen and senior members of the Royal Family were shocked by publication of the pictures taken in a Las Vegas hotel suite. They were sold to TMZ yesterday and within minutes were being viewed by internet users around the world. But farcically British websites, newspapers and television stations were prevented from reproducing them after Prince Charles instructed lawyers to threaten legal action for infringing Prince Harry’s ‘privacy’. The grainy shots, taken on a fellow reveller’s mobile phone, show the Queen’s grandson stark naked – apart from a distinctive thong necklace and his Rolex watch – playing a game of ‘naked billiards’ in his high rollers’ suite at the five-star Wynn Hotel. Scandal: Prince Harry during a pool party on his Las Vegas holiday. Other images of him naked were sold to a US website yesterday and within minutes were being viewed by internet users around the world . A quick search on the the internet allows people to see the pictures that are 'banned' in the UK . An identical search on Google images for 'Prince Harry naked pictures' reveals dozens more shots of the cavorting Prince . The photos were first published by US site TMZ. But they are now being run on dozens of websites, including: . In one picture the prince can be seen . cupping his hands around his groin in a fruitless attempt to preserve . his modesty as an apparently naked dark-haired girl hides behind him. He can then be seen hugging what appears to be the same woman by the side of the pool table as other partygoers look on. Remarkably, . far from showing any public contrition over the scandal the playboy . prince was said by friends to feel ‘fairly bullish’. ‘He’s not eating an awful lot of humble pie as I understand,’ said one. Should British newspapers and websites publish the nude pictures of Prince Harry in Las Vegas? Another . royal source dismissed the pictures as Harry ‘simply letting off . steam’, adding: ‘He’s a very exuberant character and he was on a . completely private holiday.’ Although the offending photographs were . circulating freely on the internet all day as well as being published on . the front pages of newspapers in countries including Ireland, Charles’s . lawyers, Harbottle and Lewis, went to the Press Complaints Commission . to prevent British newspapers from doing the same. A spokesman for the prince insisted that . they were taken on ‘an entirely private occasion’ and argued that Harry . had a ‘reasonable expectation of privacy’ in his own hotel suite. He also flatly rejected suggestions by the media that it would be in the public interest to use the pictures given that Harry is now travelling the globe representing both his grandmother, the Queen, and the nation as a senior working member of the Royal Family. St James’s Palace even went so far as to suggest it would be ‘prurient’ for the British media to use them although it admitted it was powerless to prevent US websites from publishing the shots. But St James’s Palace stance on the . issue has lead to some commentators to raise questions about the . influence of the Leveson inquiry. Royal correspondent Robert Jobson, writing for CNN, said: 'Surely the British paying public has a right to know what their royal family is up to. 'But post-Leveson no editor seemed, initially at least, is prepared to risk the backlash. 'Amid . all the media navel-gazing there seems to be a genuine fear that the . press feels it is no longer drinking in ""The Last Chance Saloon"" but . time has already been called.' What happens in Vegas... doesn't stay in Vegas: The party-loving royal was enjoying himself - but it is unclear as to what sort of reaction he will face on his return home . Surrounded by new-found friends, the Prince did not have a care in the world - until everyone else saw the photos . The existence of the photographs – and . the palace’s attempts to ban the media from using them – were quickly . picked up by all the major broadcasters including the BBC, ITV and Sky . who featured prominent reports on the issue in their major news . bulletins, highlighting they were also prevented from reproducing them. Bare-chested and wearing sunglasses, he blends in perfectly with the rest of the pool party revellers. But the man sharing Prince Harry’s Jacuzzi in Las Vegas is in fact his taxpayer-funded police protection officer. The unnamed Scotland Yard officer, on the left in the picture above, was one of at least three personal protection officers tasked with guarding the 27-year-old prince round the clock on his US holiday. His police detail is estimated to cost the taxpayer £2million a year, and the photos are bound to raise questions at the highest level. Dai Davies, the former head of Scotland Yard’s Royalty Protection Squad, said it was a ‘very tricky situation’ for the officers. But he added: ‘I’m not exactly sure how [protecting Harry] can be done when you are wearing your swimming trunks in a Jacuzzi. Where is his gun for a start? And if he is not deemed to need one then is there any justification for him being there?’ Harry . landed at Heathrow from Los Angeles shortly before 4pm yesterday. Despite reports that he would be dragged up to Scotland to explain . himself in person to both his grandmother and father who are holidaying . on their private estates, royal sources said they were not aware of . this. But the prince – and his Scotland Yard bodyguards – will be expected to explain just how he ended up partying naked with a group of ‘hot chicks’ he had apparently just met in his £5,100-a-night suite in the five-star Wynn Hotel and, more importantly, why they were allowed to film it. The Queen’s former press secretary, Dickie Arbiter, said Harry was a ‘loose cannon and shouldn’t be left alone’. Labour MP Stephen Pound added: ‘This is a first for the royals and a new low for the royal protection team.’ The . latest incident to involve the party-loving prince, who turns 28 next . month, has come as a huge disappointment to his palace advisers, who had . been buoyed by Harry’s growing maturity. His decision to retrain as a pilot, . proving himself good enough to fly the military’s most high-profile . attack helicopter, the Apache, with a view to returning to the front . line in Afghanistan had apparently helped him turn a corner. Earlier . this year he undertook his first official foreign tour on behalf of the . Queen and charmed statesmen and members of the public alike from the . Bahamas to Brazil with his puppyish enthusiasm. The trip was deemed such a success that there was already talk of another next year if his military commitments permitted. As a result the prince was also asked to become an official Olympic Team GB Ambassador. His . most significant job came less than two weeks ago when he was asked to . stand in for the Queen at the closing ceremony of the London Games in . front of an audience of billions. Moment of realisation? Harry arrived in Los Angeles just an hour after the photos surfaced on the internet and spent much of his time on his mobile phone suggesting that the news had been broken to him . Explaining himself? The young prince was on holiday after an exemplary performance as an Olympics ambassador - but his good work might unravel after the publication of photos of his antics . Tense: In blue shirt, cream panama hat and sunglasses, the prince looked apprehensive as he waited outside a restaurant in trendy Venice Beach .

"You should never tempt fate in football but Manchester City did just that and were left red-faced ahead of their 1-1 draw with Roma in the Champions League on Tuesday night. City's official Twitter feed light-heartedly tweeted their Italian counterparts ahead of kick-off saying: 'We're looking forward to hosting you Roma, and legendary player such as Totti. He's never scored in England, has he?' The Serie A side replied: 'You're right Man City, our Capitano has never scored in England. But there's always a first time for everything...'

"Prince Albert can hardly be blamed for keeping a tight grip on his bride-to-be. Faced with extraordinary claims that Charlene Wittstock had tried to run away home to South Africa only days before their £50million wedding, Monaco’s ruler took her on a tour of the principality. The idea, apparently, was to show that the wedding festivities, due to start with a concert tonight and two lavish ceremonies on Friday and Saturday, are still on. This way: Prince Albert II of Monaco keeps a guiding hand on Charlene Wittstock's arm as they visit the installations for the Jean Michel Jarre concert . But a confidant of the prince stoked . speculation about what led to Miss Wittstock supposedly being stopped at . Nice airport  trying to board a flight with a  one-way ticket last . week. The 33-year-old former Olympic swimmer was said to have learned a distressing revelation about the prince’s private life. Stéphane Bern, France’s leading . royal TV commentator and a  close friend of 53-year-old Albert, . suggested a woman could be  claiming to be pregnant by the prince, whose . notorious private  life has already produced two  illegitimate . children. He told Le Parisien newspaper: ‘A . woman could very well be pretending that she is pregnant by the Prince. We can’t carry out a DNA test to check this out just three days before . the marriage.’ Asked why Prince Albert had not . issued a personal denial he replied: ‘A sovereign ruler is not going to . lower himself to saying: “No, my fiancée did not want to leave me this . weekend”.’ Hand in hand: Prince Albert II and Charlene Wittstock soaked up the sun and publicity today as they glossed over claims she tried to run home to South Africa after hearing a distressing revleation about the Monaco ruler . Keep smiling: Prince Albert II of Monaco and Charlene Wittstock embrace besisde musician Jean Michel Jarre, centre, who will sing for their wedding on Friday . Walkabout: The couple were visiting the installations for the wedding . Wearing skinny black jeans, a white tunic,a pashmina and a black tasselled necklace, Miss Wittstock looked relaxed as she and the prince visited some of the installations being erected for their £50million wedding. The walkabout came as it emerged that the 53-year-old royal threatened a legal battle to uncover the palace mole who threatened to destroy his big day. Miss Wittstock, a former Olympic swimmer whose father was a photocopier salesman, is said to have been stopped by police at Nice airport as she tried to board a flight with a one-way ticket. L’Express, the Paris news magazine . which broke the story, was today standing by it – as Prince Albert’s legal team . made no attempt to injunct it. Instead it is demanding that L’Express reveals its sources – providing all of its evidence for the claim, although has not officially filed a lawsuit. Love children: Prince Albert's son Alexandre was born after an affair . with Nicole Coste, an air hostess, while his other child is daughter . Jazmin, right, pictured at age nine . Relaxed: The couple enjoy an equestrian event in Monaco at the weekend, shortly before the French magazine published the claims . This is because Albert fears further . revelations before Friday, when the eyes of the world . will be on Monaco at the start of his nuptials. In turn, L’Express editor-in-chief . Renaud Revel confirmed that no attempt had been made to get the story . removed from the magazine’s website. Mr Revel, a highly respected author . and investigative journalist, said he would make sure that the . confidentiality of his sources was protected at all costs. ‘There had been all kinds of threats against us, but nothing has been filed in court and it won’t be,’ a source at the magazine added, . Colleagues at L’Express include . Christophe Barbier, the editorial director, who is a close personal . friend of French first lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy. ‘These men are top class, hugely well . connected journalists, and they know exactly what they’re writing . about,’ said the source. ‘They have superb sources and . would give them up to no one, not even an angry prince.' Anticipation: Tourists walk past under flags specially erected for the wedding . Preparations: Monaco flags fly in Casino Square in the principality ahead of Friday's vivil ceremony and Saturday's religious one, which will be attended by royalty from across Europe . Bunting: Monaco flags, centre, fly alongside South African flags in honour of the bride-to-be . Mini kingdom: A view of Monaco, which despite its tiny size is big in wealth and glamour . ‘Albert is desperate to find the palace mole because he fears further revelations. His lawyers are . working overtime to try and find out who has been talking, but the truth . is that the whole of Monaco is abuzz with rumours.’ Prince Albert has fathered two . illegitimate children – six-year-old Alexandre, the son of Nicole Coste, . a former Air France air hostess from Togo, and Jazmin, 19, whose . mother is Tamara Rotola, an American estate agent. A pregnant woman may be preparing to name Prince Albert as the father of her unborn baby days before his wedding, one of his closest confidantes said today. Stephane Bern, France’s leading royal TV commentator and a close friend and advisor of the Prince, has told Le Parisien newspaper there could be yet another love child expected soon. Mr Bern said: ‘A woman could very well be pretending that she is pregnant by the Prince. ‘We can’t carry out a DNA test to check this out just three days before the marriage! The problem is that we can makes claims, and then contradict them to no avail. ‘There are people who prefer to tarnish a happy event. For once there is (a happy event) in a family which has experienced so much misfortune - leave them in peace!’ Albert has two illegitimate children by two former girlfriends, but always denied they were his until scientific analysis proved otherwise. In both cases, DNA tests were needed before Albert admitted he was the father, and agreed to pay for their upbringings. The unspecified L’Express revelations . are believed to relate to Albert’s tangled love life, but his lawyer . Thierry Lacoste has described them as ‘madness’, adding: ‘Everything is . false.’ Mr Lacoste confirmed he was taking . legal action to uncover L’Express’s sources, adding: ‘I was with the . Prince and Charlene Wittstock in Paris three days ago, and I can promise . you that all is well.’ The extraordinary allegations emerged just two days before the extravagant three-day celebrations for the wedding are to start. The . guest list includes the Earl and Countess of Wessex, as well as . President Nicolas Sarkozy, Naomi Campbell, Karl Lagerfeld, Giorgio . Armani, Richard Branson, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and business tycoon . Philip Green. The Eagles will perform at a concert to celebrate the wedding tomorrow and the civil ceremony takes place on Friday. A religious ceremony will be held on . Saturday in a 13th century church and will be attended by royalty from all over . Europe. After that comes a white tie ball. Now the royal wedding plans are at risk of being overshadowed by the astonishing claims. But Albert, whose previous girlfriends have included Brooke Shields and Claudia Schiffer, has weathered such storms before. A source in Monaco said: ‘Albert is absolutely furious about the latest claims and will be taking legal action against L’Express. ‘He’s had a turbulent private life, and doesn’t need this just a few days before his big day.’ An official statement from the palace said: ‘The Prince’s Palace firmly denies the allegations. ‘These rumours, spread a few days . before the wedding ceremonies of H.S.H. Prince Albert and Miss Charlene . Wittstock, have only one purpose – to seriously damage the Sovereign’s . image and by consequence that of Miss Wittstock and to cause serious . prejudice to a happy event.’","Former Olympic swimmer Charlene Wittstock, 33, 'tried to head home to South Africa on one-way ticket'

"Former Liverpool striker David N'Gog called time on his career in Britain this summer but has seemingly gone missing since returning to France. The French frontman, who also played for Bolton and Swansea, joined Ligue 1 side Stade de Reims during the summer and managed to find the net in his only appearance  for the club so far.

"Gary Lineker is disgusted at alleged corruption within FIFA and has labelled the decision to play the 2022 World Cup in Qatar as ‘ludicrous’. Lineker, part of England’s bid team for the 2018 tournament won by Russia, insists that England should not bid for the competition again if the only way to win is by bending the rules. Speaking in an interview with GQ magazine, the former England striker said: ‘I was with David Beckham having a burger the night before the Qatar decision. We were out trying to get support.

I am not against it going to different parts of the world, but you’d have thought they might have known it would be very hot in summer. ‘You have to be careful what you say, but the corruption is just . . . yuck.’ Lineker suggested the only way of changing FIFA was for ‘clean’ countries to boycott the World Cup but acknowledged that will not happen.

Asked if he sees FIFA as not fit for purpose, Lineker added: ‘Yes, and it is such a shame because it is a massive sport and means so much to so many people. ‘England are too straight, in a way — and I am not saying that as a criticism. We should stand up for what is right and if that means never hosting the World Cup again, fine. 'The only way it might change is for the clean countries to turn around and say, “You know what, we are not taking part in your tournaments”. But I can’t see it happening. There is too much at stake.’ Making a stand: Greg Dyke has said England will not bid to host the World Cup while Sepp Blatter is in charge . FA chairman Greg Dyke has said they would not consider a bid to host the World Cup as long as Blatter was in charge at FIFA. Lineker also called for restrictions on advertising by gambling firms and alcohol products related to football. He said: ‘I have turned down deals with alcohol firms over the years. I do not agree with it.’ He added: ‘Gambling is just too easy to do now and as a parent I worry about it all those ads bombarding you with in-play betting.’","Former England striker brands FIFA president Sepp Blatter a dictator .

"Northern Ireland captain Steven Davis has called for a repeat of the Budapest blueprint when his side take on Greece. Davis and company kicked off their Euro 2016 campaign with a impressive 2-1 win in Hungary, coming from behind with a pair of late goals to take the points. A straightforward home success over the Faroe Islands followed at the weekend but that hardly required the levels of intensity needed in that opening fixture. Northern Ireland captain Steven Davis is aiming to replicate the win over Hungary, facing Greece on Tuesday . And the experience of seeing off higher-ranked opponents on their own turf is driving Davis as he eyes another prize scalp in Athens. 'All the away games will be difficult for us but we put in a great performance in Hungary and we deservedly won the game,' he said. 'That's the blueprint we're going to work off when we play Greece. That's the standard we have to reach in every game we play in this group. 'It will be no easy task but as a group we need to be at the top of our game every time to get results and that will be the case again. Davis, in action on Saturday, is keen for Northern Ireland to copy the form shown so far in Euro 2016 qualifying . 'We realise it's going to be very difficult but we're confident - after our opening two qualifiers - we can get a result.' Greece reached the 2014 World Cup by maximising their return for every goal. They scored just 12 times in 10 qualifiers, but a stingy defence saw those goals converted into 25 points and they sealed second place behind Bosnia-Herzegovina. A defeat by Romania and a draw in Finland suggest the model is not yet as finely tuned under Claudio Ranieri as it was for his predecessor Fernando Santos, but Davis hopes for a typically close game. Gareth McAuley celebrates after his strike put Northern Ireland 1-0 up against the Faroe Islands on Saturday .

'We are aware of individual players that they have, but I think their strength is the team. Having seen the game against Finland they are going to be a threat. 'Hopefully it will be tightly contested again and we can keep them at bay and create some chances ourselves.

"So Luis Suarez was sitting at home in Montevideo when he suddenly remembered that he had, after all, bitten Giorgio Chiellini. Well, these things can slip one’s mind. Who hasn’t, at a busy moment, forgotten sinking their teeth into another human being? Who hasn’t been innocently enjoying a cup of tea, only to be hit by the realisation: ‘Didn’t I bite that bloke in the queue at Waitrose last Thursday?’ Slap of the head, roll of the eyes. So that’s what all the fuss was about with the police and the sirens and the handcuffs. VIDEO Scroll down to see Suarez's first high-profile bites as he vows it won't happen again . Apology: Luis Suarez has finally expressed his regret for biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini last week . On the move? Sportsmail's mock up of Suarez in a Barcelona kit (left) and the frontman back in Uruguay (right) VIDEO Sorry Suarez admits Chiellini bite . We can surely now understand Suarez’s confusion. There he was, being bundled out of the World Cup, banned from football for four months, and all the time racking his brains. Why me? What have I done? And then the penny drops. ‘Stone me,’ he exclaims, a mere six days later. ‘It must have been that bite. The one I said was a complete accident, when I fell with my mouth open, landed on some chap’s shoulder and hurt my teeth. 'Now I come to think of it - I did do it on purpose. Just like I bit that other bloke, and the one before. I really should apologise. What a silly old sausage I’ve been. Three times now.’ There is, of course, another explanation: but one would have to be a real cynic, or an English journalist, to go there. Suarez is still at home in Montevideo but in this scenario the telephone rings. It is his representative. He has been speaking to Barcelona. Suspension: Luis Suarez was banned for four months after appearing to bite Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini . Apparently, they are reluctant to pay in the region of £80million for a player who goes around chomping on people and then behaving as if he is the victim of a terrible conspiracy. They think it might be bad for their business. If they are to pursue a transfer this summer, a slate needs to be wiped clean. Facts have to be faced. Responsibility has to be taken. Say sorry, or no deal. This would be why, almost a week after the event, Suarez has acknowledged what the world — beyond Uruguay - knew all along. He committed a deliberately aggravated assault on an opponent, for the third occasion in his career. He promises it will never happen again. Painful: Suarez fell to the ground and held his teeth straight after the encounter with centre back Chiellini . Had that been his attitude last Tuesday it would have been more impressive, for it would have shown the remorse FIFA found so disturbingly absent from his statements after the game. Instead, Suarez was allowed to pose as the wounded party, abetted by his coach Oscar Tabarez, whose resignation from FIFA’s technical committee now looks appallingly misguided, his captain Diego Lugano, team-mates, national association and his nation’s fawning media. It also means he submitted evidence we now know was a lie, given his contrary admission since. Sadly, the sequence of events makes it impossible to take these latest words at face value. If they were sincere, why were they not said sooner? If he knows he did wrong now, why not then? The biter is opportunistic, and so is the man. About time: Suarez has delayed his apology to Chiellini but has promised he will never behave like that again . Given a pathetically easy ride by those in his camp, Suarez took the opportunity to remain in denial about his behaviour. He retreated behind a wall of risible counter-claim and victimhood, and was indulged. Dragged from this position by the reality of the global view, and football’s marketplace, he at last delivers truth. Sorry. The apology will be accepted no doubt but, given the timing, what is it really worth? The conclusion is plain. Suarez will not bite anyone again: and if Barcelona hand over £80m he will surely prove it.

Jose Mourinho has revealed rival manager Pep Guardiola is bald because 'he doesn't enjoy football' The Daily Express claim the initial spat began when Guardiola insisted grass should be no longer than 1.5cm long in order to make the game quicker. Mourinho reportedly responded: 'Everyone has his style of play, which should be respected. Football can be spectacular in several ways.' Guardiola is said to have replied: 'The beauty of football depends on the coach. It seems to me that Mourinho prefers the result to the spectacle.'

"In a football world dominated by men, one woman has been quietly working in the lower leagues of Italy for a number of years. Elena Pianigiani, has been the vice-president of Italian fourth division side US Poggibonsi since the age of 21. Having struggled between the Italian fourth and fifth tier for much of their existence, Poggibonsi, in Tuscany, saw former Siena director Antonello Pianigiani purchase 51 per cent of the club in 2008. Elena Pianigiani has been the vice-president of Italian Fourth Division side US Poggibonsi since the age of 21 . Vice-president Elena (left) poses for a picture at the US Poggibonsi ground with a shirt . Buying the remaining 49 per cent two years later, Pianigiani soon appointed his daughter as the club's vice-president. Speaking to Bleacher Report, Pianigiani revealed she didn't hesitate in accepting the position and said: 'In 2010 when my father asked me to join Poggibonsi, I didn’t think twice. 'It was unusual because I was only 21. When you’re that age, it’s usual for a father to give his daughter a new bag, not a football team.' Strictly speaking, Pianigiani's role at the club isn't her first in football. 'My passion began as a 10-year-old when my Dad was involved at our home-town club Siena,' she said. 'We were promoted to Serie B and I remember the fantastic atmosphere around the city; I became the team’s mascot! Pianigiani watches on from the stands as her side Poggibonsi battle it out on the field . While Poggibonsi's vice-president admits football is dominated by males, she is encouraged by the progress women are making in the game and said:'Calcio is very macho, but something is certainly changing with more women appearing, though I believe purely technical aspects are suitable for only men. I do think women are essential, however, companies are companies and it’s always good to have a woman, as we can make cold decisions when the case requires it.' However, Pianigiani isn't the only female making her way in the game. Both Rosella Sensi of Roma and Barbara Berlusconi of AC Milan, are two women who hold positions of authority within the Italian top-flight. Poggibonsi fans show their support for their team with a giant banner . As well, back in May, Helena Costa became football's first female coach when put in charge of French second division side Clermont Foot. While Costa ended up leaving the club just a month later without giving a reason for her departure, Pianigiani was pleased with Clermont's decision to appoint a female manager and said: 'It was a brave choice. I send big ""Good Luck!"" to the coach. She is a great woman to manage a dressing room. They have gained a new supporter!' A huge football fan, Pianigiani echoes the thoughts of many match-going supporters when she says: 'You're tense and anxious before and during the game, and your mood depends on the outcome. If you win, you're elated and start the working week on the right foot. But if you lose, you want to go straight to bed!' Hoping to guide Poggibonsi up the divisions, Pianigiani will be keen for many good starts to the week this season.

"Claudio Ranieri has laughed off suggestions he is already fighting to save his job as Greece manager. The former Chelsea boss, in his first international appointment following a well-travelled club career, has had a rocky start. The 62-year-old replaced Fernando Santos following this summer's World Cup with high hopes of topping a Euro 2016 qualifying group conspicuously lacking in star power. Claudio Ranieri has denied reports that he is facing the sack as Greece manager . But it has not been an easy ride so far, with a 1-0 home defeat behind closed doors against Romania and a 1-1 draw in Finland on Saturday. Discontent is brewing beneath the surface and defeat at the hands of Group F leaders Northern Ireland on Tuesday could incite the notoriously fickle Greek fans. But Ranieri was in relaxed mood at his pre-match press conference and had a colourful response for the Belfast journalist who suggested he may face the same fate as Attila Pinter, the Hungarian boss who was sacked after Northern Ireland's victory in Budapest. 'You are my friend? F***ing hell!' the Italian laughed. 'You are a very dangerous man. I am used to being under pressure. My job is hard but I love this job.' Ranieri replaced Fernando Santos in the Greece hotseat following this summer's World Cup . Ranieri later expanded on his situation, admitting that qualification was a must for the surprise 2004 champions. 'I know I have to arrive in the finals in Paris, that is my goal,' he said. 'It is very important to beat Northern Ireland. 'If we do not reach Paris it is a disaster me, for everybody, and I would be the chief executive of the disaster.' A spokesman for the Hellenic Football Federation also stepped in to remove any doubt about Ranieri's future, stating: 'There is no fear. The Hellenic Football Federation is willing to travel not just to the European Championship but to the next World Cup with Mr Ranieri. We support him with all of our efforts.' Greece (right) have started their Euro 2016 qualification poorly so far under the 62-year-old . Ranieri is taking the threat of Northern Ireland seriously, though Greece remain strongly fancied on their home turf. Having seen a number of surprising results over the past week, he is wary of any side carrying the underdog tag. 'It is not important who is favourite, we know very well Northern Ireland play good football,' he said. 'I am not surprised they are top because I know football very well and football is changing. All teams can win. Look at Spain, they lost (to Slovakia), look at Germany, they lost (to Poland), look at Russia, a draw (with Moldova). 'This makes football fantastic. The best team does not win every time. In other sports maybe, in football, no.'

"Jose Mourinho has promised to deliver a bright future for the England national team and insists if three of his young talents at Chelsea don't make it, he will be to blame. The Blues boss has earmarked young talents Lewis Baker, Izzy Brown and Dominic Solanke as future England internationals, and is showing his faith in all three on tour across Europe with the first team. And with all three set to work with the senior players during the coming season, Mourinho is putting his neck on the line by promising FA Chairman Greg Dyke that all three will be full internationals in years to come. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Chelsea youngster Lewis Baker score a brilliant backheel . Young talent: Lewis Baker . Young talent: Izzy Brown . Young talent: Dominic Solanke . England's saviour: Jose Mourinho reckons he has three players who will play for the national team in future .

Potential: Brown (No 11) helps Solanke (No 10) celebrate a goal at the Euro U-17 Championships . Lewis Baker (19) Chelsea's Young Player of the Year made his first team debut as a substitute against Derby in the FA Cup. Known for his ability to hit free kicks with either foot, Baker has captained a number of Chelsea youth sides and was player of the tournament in 2013's NextGen series. Izzy Brown (17) Became the Premier League's second youngest player ever when he made his debut for West Brom before moving to Chelsea. Helped England to the Euro U-17 title this summer and can play across the forward line. Dominic Solanke (16) Four goals in four games at the Euro U-17 Championships and 20 in 25 appearances for Chelsea's youth sides mark Solanke out as a poacher. He took a GCSE English Literature exam the day after scoring the opener for his country in the U-17 final this summer. The Portuguese coach says he will shoulder the blame if 19-year-old Baker, 17-year-old Brown and 16-year-old Solanke do not make it for Chelsea and England - with all three staying under his tutelage at Stamford Bridge this campaign along with French youngster Jeremie Boga. ‘My conscience tells me that if, for example, Baker, Brown, and Solanke are not national team players in a few years, I should blame myself,’ Mourinho said. ‘They are part of a process the club started without me. In this moment, we have players who will be Chelsea players. And when they become Chelsea players, they will become England players, almost for sure. ‘At 16 or 17 I don’t think it’s good for them to go somewhere else to play, like in the Championship. At 17 they have to train with us and they have to learn with us. They will learn a lot.' And with Mourinho needing to make up the numbers with English players in his first team squad, Baker could be line for first team appearances this season, while Brown and Solanke are set to appear in the club's Capital One Cup games. All three are still likely to get minutes against Vitesse in Chelsea's fifth pre season friendly on Wednesday, despite the impending returns of the likes of Eden Hazard and Romelu Lukaku.

"Click here to see our brilliant Matchzone including Gareth McAuley's opening goal for Northern Ireland . Northern Ireland are the unlikely early leaders of their Euro 2016 qualifying group after first-half finishes from Gareth McAuley and Kyle Lafferty eased them to victory over the Faroe Islands to make it two wins in as many matches. A 2-0 scoreline may not be one to write home about against a side ranked 179th in the world, and only going in one direction on this evidence, but the result is a significant one - taking Michael O'Neill's side to the Group F summit and giving them their best start to a campaign since 1968. Both goals came inside 20 minutes and although a mountain of possession did not yield a third, goalkeeper Roy Carroll ensured it would be a blemish-free night at Windsor Park with his superb penalty save from Frodi Benjaminsen. Gareth McAuley wheels away in celebration after his sixth minute strike put Northern Ireland 1-0 up against the Faroe Islands . McAuley celebrates with teammates after putting his side 1-0 up early on in the match . The Faroe Islands' team watch on as McAuley wheels away in celebration during the Group F match . Northern Ireland: Carroll, McLaughlin, McAuley (McCullough 56), Ferguson, Hughes, Baird, McGinn (McCourt 67), Norwood, Davis, Ward, Lafferty (Magennis 84) Subs not used: McGivern, McKay, Mannus, Evans, Clingan, McLaughlin, Reeves, McGovern . Goals: McAuley 6, Lafferty 20 . Booked: Ferguson 36 . Faroe Islands: Nielsen, Gregersen, Nattestad, Justinussen (Bartalsstovu 90+1), Davidsen, Thor Naes, Benjaminsen, Hansson, Holst (Olsen 82), Edmundsson, Klettskard (Hansen 75) Subs not used: Hanssen, Sorensen, Matras Gestsson, Mellemgaard, Baldvinsson Vatnsdal, Jorgin Djurhuus, Hansen, Thomsen . Booked: Thor Naes 15, . Referee: Alon Yefet . McAuley got the ball rolling in the sixth minute with his fifth international goal and Lafferty - who grabbed the winner against Hungary last month - doubled the advantage with a smart finish from Shane Ferguson's pass. A trip to top seeds Greece awaits on Tuesday and a positive result there could yet raise hopes of a first ever appearance at the European Championships for the green and white army. The home fans, reduced to little over 10,000 by ongoing redevelopment work at the national stadium, were given a slice of pre-match inspiration with an on-pitch appearance by Belfast boy and IBF super bantamweight world champion Carl Frampton in the build-up. Frampton's walkabout upped the atmosphere considerably - no easy task with two stands demolished - and the home side responded with a flurry of early jabs at their opponents before McAuley landed the first clean blow. The West Brom man's night almost ended before it had begun, with the centre-half requiring treatment having thrown himself at the far post in pursuit of a Norwood free-kick. McAuley's next involvement, this time from Oliver Norwood's corner, saw him react quickest to Chris Baird's flick on before rattling a crisp first-time effort into the net. Having settled quickly the green shirts were soon pouring forward, Niall McGinn and Jamie Ward making inroads down the flanks and Steven Davis thrusting through the middle in an advanced role. Their second goal almost came from the unlikely source of right-back Conor McLaughlin, who met a corner with an audacious attempt off the instep, but it was Lafferty who did the business. Ferguson was the creator, cutting in and looking for his striker's run with a measured ball through the middle. Lafferty finished coolly, ghosting past the Faroes backline and touching into the bottom corner. Kyle Lafferty doubled Northern Ireland's lead in the 20th minute, when his deft touch at the front post beat the keeper . Lafferty pumps his fist in celebration after the goal that secured Northern Ireland's win - and continued their 100% win record . Roy Carroll came to Northern Ireland's rescue when he saved a penalty from Frodi Benjaminsen 10 minutes before half-time . The Norwich forward should have had another moments later when Ward's cross found him unmarked six yards out but Motherwell goalkeeper Gunnar Nielsen stuck out a glove to make a fine reaction save. The Faroes were living down to their reputation, sitting deep and inviting Northern Ireland forward, with Davis having taken up residence at the edge of the area. The skipper twice lofted over when his chance came but his movement was leaving the Faroes chasing shadows. Lafferty was also a constant threat, tempting Ragnar Nattestad into a crude challenge and later leaving him for dead to head another great chance just wide of the post.

Tor Naes (left) tackles Niall McGinn (right) during the Euro 2016 Group F qualifier at Windsor Park, Belfast on Saturday night . It took the visitors 35 minutes to muster a meaningful attack and, improbably, it earned them a penalty. Ferguson was the guilty man, needlessly tugging Joan Edmundsson's shirt as the chased Hallur Hansson's chipped pass. Benjaminsen struck the spot-kick well but Carroll flung himself the left and pushed the ball against the post one-handed, his second penalty save in a week following a similar effort for Notts County. The second half began with a familiar pattern, the home team dominating posession but finding one too many white shirts blocking their route to goal. Norwood and Davis were close to passing their way round the roadblock on several occasions but the islanders just about held their line.

With little or no forward threat O'Neill gave McAuley a breather with less than an hour gone, Doncaster's Luke McCullough earning a competitive debut in his place. A third goal remained elusive, Ward dragging wide following a swift break by Davis and McGinn slotting wide with the goal at his mercy. With little more than 20 minutes to go the mercurial Paddy McCourt was given the chance to change that, replacing his former Celtic team-mate McGinn. The Brighton winger injected an element of unpredictability, but in truth the momentum had largely evaporated. Ward came closest to putting the icing on the cake with nine minutes left, drilling a long-range free-kick low towards the bottom corner and drawing an ungainly sprawling save from Nielsen.","Gareth McAuley opened the scoring in the sixth minute to put Northern Ireland 1-0 up .

"Roy Carroll has warned his Northern Ireland team-mates there is plenty more to Kostas Mitroglou than his farcical Fulham stint suggested. Michael O'Neill's side are flying high at the top of Group F having won their second Euro 2016 match in succession on Saturday, a 2-0 success over the Faroe Islands, but a tougher test awaits when they face top seeds Greece on Tuesday night. The trip to Athens is a return to familiar territory for Carroll, who spent two years at Olympiacos before leaving this summer. Northern Ireland goalkeeper Roy Carroll spent two years alongside Kostas Mitroglou at Olympiacos . The 37-year-old goalkeeper, who made a brilliant penalty save to keep a clean sheet against the Faroes, will be coming up against a handful of former team-mates, including Mitroglou. The striker arrived at Craven Cottage with an £11million price tag in January and the task of saving Fulham from Premier League relegation. Instead, having struggled with injury, he fell short of Felix Magath's high physical standards and was largely treated as a pariah, starting just once and featuring from the bench twice more. He was packed back off to Olympiacos on loan in August and announced his return with the winning goal in a Champions League tie against Atletico Madrid. It is that Mitroglou that Carroll knows best, not the Fulham misfit. ""He's a quality player,"" said the veteran shot stopper. Mitroglou (right) had a difficult spell at Fulham this year and could not adapt to the regime of Felix Magath . ""I know what he's like, he is a player who can score goals from anywhere, he could pop up in the first minute or last minute and score a goal against us. ""He needs good players around him, and when he was at Olympiacos he had good players around him and he scored goals in the league and in the Champions League, which proved how good he was. ""But he went to Fulham and it was very difficult because they were in a bad situation when he moved over and he got injured as well before he went. He was out for two months with a knee injury but he's back now and he's already scored a goal in the Champions League."" Carroll also has plenty of insight into the mentality of the Greek fans and believes Northern Ireland could take advantage of their fickle nature with a strong start. ""I know what fans in Greece are like and hopefully if we can keep them quiet they might turn on their players...the Greek fans can do that,"" he said. ""They are very passionate especially about their sports; football, basketball water polo, they live for their sports and if the players don't turn it on on Tuesday night they could turn on them. ""They could go either way, they could go crazy or they could be quiet, it depends on the game."" Carroll left Greece with a heavy heart but knew he had to look elsewhere when a change in management saw him shunted to third choice at Olympiacos. An offer was on the table to join the coaching staff but instead he decided to return to English football, where he is now with Notts County, to keep his international ambitions alive. ""I enjoyed myself in Greece, two and a half years at a great club,"" he said. ""I'm looking forward to going back because I had great times there and I was disappointed to leave with the family settled but I needed to play more football so I could keep playing for Northern Ireland.""","Carroll played two seasons alongside Mitroglou at Olympiacos .

"The Football Association has confirmed its decision to reject Hull's name change is currently in arbitration. The club's proposal to rebrand from Hull City AFC to Hull Tigers, pushed for by owner Assem Allam in a bid to attract increased overseas investment, was thrown out by the FA Council in April.

"Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill has criticised Watford's treatment of his former assistant Billy McKinlay, while defender Chris Baird has called for the Scot to make a hasty return to his previous position. McKinlay left his post as O'Neill's deputy to become the Hornets' new head coach at the end of last month but was out of a job within just eight days as the club's owners made the baffling decision to replace him with Slavisa Jokanovic - their fourth boss of the season. In his brief time in charge, the former Scotland international took four points from two games and O'Neill struggled to hide his frustration at McKinlay's circumstances. Billy McKinlay (above) was replaced as Watford manager after just eight days in the job . Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill (centre) is outraged at the treatment of McKinlay . 'I'm very disappointed for him, and really I think Watford have to look at themselves,' he told Sky Sports News. 'Billy's not done anything untoward there - he went in in difficult circumstances, got a win and a draw and suddenly finds himself out of work again which is very poor. 'There's a human aspect to football as well and I think the owners, technical directors and chief executives need to consider that when they're playing with people's lives in this way.' O'Neill has been preparing Northern Ireland for Saturday's Euro 2016 qualifier against the Faroe Islands and the trip to Greece three days later. It is the first time he has worked with the squad without McKinlay's input, with Irish FA elite performance director Jim Magilton and youth team coach Stephen Robinson helping out on this occasion. Both men already have long-term projects in hand meaning O'Neill's previous number two could feasibly be back in his old post in time for November's trip to Romania. And Baird, who spent several years working with McKinlay during the pair's time at Fulham, would welcome him with open arms. McKinlay had made a decent start at Vicarage Road, winning one and drawing one of his two games in charge . Former Chelsea and Serbia midfielder Slavisa Jokanovic has taken over from McKinlay . 'I don't know what the situation is with Billy but he was great working with us and personally I would like to see him come back,' said the West Brom man. 'That's nothing against Jim and Robbo but I would like to see him back with us. He was doing a good job here and obviously I know him well from my time with Fulham. 'I've not spoken to him but I think Michael has, to see what his situation is. 'I would just like to see him back.' O'Neill has been fully focused on the matches ahead and was more equivocal than Baird when asked if McKinlay would slot back in. He would likely prefer a commitment until the end of the current campaign from the next appointee while McKinlay, having had the briefest of tastes, may now be minded to persevere finding work as a number one. Chris Baird worked with former Watford manager McKinlay during his time at Fulham . 'That's something that's really not for now,' said O'Neill. 'We've kept communication going over the week and that's something we can address down the line.' Baird, meanwhile, has spoken of his satisfaction at the style of football Northern Ireland have been attempting to play under O'Neill. The 32-year-old has more than a decade of international football under his belt and was part of the side that came close to a first ever European Championship appearance under Lawrie Sanchez six years ago. Whether or not O'Neill can take the squad one step better remains to be seen but Baird is happy with the way they are trying. 'Every manager has different ways of playing... With Lawrie I would say we would lump it a bit more. Stick it in the channel, get after it, work hard,' he said. 'Now we're trying to play a bit more, you can see that in the performance and the goals we scored when we beat Hungary last month. 'You don't want to be known for kicking it long. Sometimes that does work but a lot of the players are used to playing at a good level with our clubs and passing on the floor. 'We want to bring that to Northern Ireland too.'","Billy McKinlay left his post as Northern Ireland No 2 to take over at Watford .

"Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany remains unflustered by Chelsea's early lead at the top of the Barclays Premier League. Jose Mourinho's pacesetters are three points clear at the summit after six games and a further two ahead of a City side who are widely seen as their likeliest title challengers. The only points that Chelsea have dropped thus far came in the 1-1 draw at City last month, suggesting the Blues are not likely to let their advantage slide easily, but Kompany knows there is plenty of mileage yet in the 2014/15 campaign. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany isn't bothered by Chelsea's fast start to the season . He led the side that looked dead and buried in the title race three seasons ago, only to take the title on the final day, and also saw Arsenal drop off from a strong position last term. 'I can't really say that personally I'm looking too much at Chelsea,' said the Belgian. 'When we won the league first time (in 2012), we were nine points behind with six or seven games left to play. Diego Costa's flying start has led Chelsea to four wins out of five in the Premier League so far . 'Last year Arsenal were leading by six or seven points and ahead of everyone in February but it ended up being between Liverpool and us. 'There are so many reasons why I'm not really focusing on getting back at Chelsea.' City recorded their first league win in four at Hull last weekend and, far from obsessing over their rivals' start, Kompany is training his focus squarely on another away day at Aston Villa on Saturday. Frank Lampard rescued a point for Manchester City in a 1-1 draw with Chelsea at the Etihad . 'Away games in the Premier League are ever so difficult, so it was good for us to get a result (at Hull),' he said. 'There are no easy games ahead. The next game is at Aston Villa. 'Every fixture is a potential slip-up, but that's what's exciting about this league. I just look at the way we are playing and I just know we are going in the right direction. That's the most important thing for us.'","Manchester City captain unflustered by Chelsea's fast start .

"Hull owner Assem Allam has warned he will stop 'throwing money' at the club if he cannot force through his controversial 'Tigers' rebrand. Allam has been bankrolling Hull since saving the club from financial calamity in 2010, and has invested upwards of £70million in the team since then. He believes the only route to sustainability lies in changing the official name from Hull City AFC to Hull Tigers, a move he thinks would lead to sizeable overseas investment. Hull owner Assem Allam (left) wants Hull City to be renamed 'Hull Tigers' to attract overseas investment . Despite the Football Association Council throwing out his proposal in April, Allam backed manager Steve Bruce's rebuilding plans this summer with over £30million of transfer funds. But the 75-year-old Egyptian, who is engaged in arbitration with the FA over its decision and has also put the club up for sale, insists there will be no more spending unless he gets his way. 'That [the money] stops now. It has to stop,' Allam told BBC's Football Focus. 'I won't pay out if I cannot create income. That is called 'throwing money at it'.' 'I won't throw money at a problem. I want to deal with the problem.' Allam's latest intervention cannot have been welcomed by Bruce, who has done his level best to play peacemaker in an increasingly bitter stand-off between the owner and sections of the fan base for over a year now. Hull have struggled on the pitch this season and haven't won in the Premier League since the opening day . That his words come on the eve of a home match against Crystal Palace, meanwhile, represents an unwelcome case of deja vu. It was the corresponding fixture last season when protests against the name change plan reached fever pitch, with supporter demonstrations proving an unwanted distraction as Hull slipped to their first home defeat. The atmosphere at the KC Stadium has been on a knife edge at times this term, with chants of 'City Till We Die' now booed by rival elements of the crowd. Allam took over in 2010 and has since helped them get into the Premier League and reach the FA Cup final . What awaits in the stands on Saturday, when Bruce's main priority is a first win since the opening day of the season, is now an open question. But the manager was pragmatic when asked to comment on Allam's position ahead of the match. Bruce noted that no further spending was now possible until January but insisted he would not be shy about requesting funds when the time comes. Hull manager Steve Bruce has had to act as a peacemaker between Allam and angry supporters . 'The window's finished and I'm sure he (Allam) is delighted, but it's my job to knock the door and want better and if I'm not doing that I'm not doing my job right,' he said. 'I will always, always ask the question. Of course it's not a bottomless pit, we understand that, and I have to say the chairman and the owners have assembled a wonderful squad together here. 'We can't argue or grumble about what we've been able to put together. So I wont be mithering him now but then the window doesn't open for another three months. I'll have a little nibble then.'","Hull City owner Assem Allam wants to rename the club 'Hull Tigers' to attract overseas investment .

"Northern Ireland are relishing a rare chance to focus on attack against the Faroe Islands, according to manager Michael O'Neill. O'Neill's side do not go into many matches with a heavy expectation of victory but Saturday's home clash against a side ranked 179th in the world, nestling neatly between Chinese Taipei and the Turks & Caicos Islands, is one such occasion. Expectations are even loftier given last month's impressive 2-1 away win over Hungary in their first Euro 2016 qualifier, but O'Neill accepts this will be a much different challenge. Manager Michael O'Neill leads a training session at Windsor Park, Belfast on Friday . Kyle Lafferty (centre) is one of the Northern Irish players relishing the chance for all-out attack . He will ask, as always, for defensive rigour and tactical discipline but has tailored this week's training sessions firmly towards breaking down the opposition rather than holding them off at the other end. And it is a shift in emphasis that has gone down well in the squad. 'There has been a lot of focus on our attacking play especially, our approach has been slightly different,' he said. 'Obviously when you are doing attacking play the players enjoy it more than the other side of the game so it's been a really good week. The mood in the camp is excellent. 'We anticipate having more possession than we have had in our recent away games and given that we will have more possession we hope to turn that into opportunities. 'You just can't go out and play off the cuff and play in a cavalier fashion. But our attacking players often have to do a lot of work off the ball. This is an opportunity to show the other side to their game.' Chris Brunt stretches during Friday's training session, ahead of Northern Ireland's match on Saturday . Aaron Hughes (left) and Oliver Norwood (right) discuss the sharp fall off at the side of the Windsor Park pitch . The game also represents a first home fixture for Northern Ireland in 13 months, during which time O'Neill's squad have played eight successive away games and racked up 34,000 air miles. Home comforts may be hard to come by at Windsor Park though, with two stands having been demolished as part of the ongoing redevelopment. Capacity has been reduced to 10,500 as a result but O'Neill is more interested in the new and improved playing surface. 'The pitch is always the priority for me. It's great. The surroundings pale into insignificance if I'm honest and I think the players certainly enjoyed the training on it,' he said. Kyle Lafferty scored a pivotal goal in Northern Ireland's last Euro 2016 qualifier against Hungary . O'Neill looks on (left) as his players train at Windsor Park on Friday, ahead of their Faroe Islands clash . 'I don't think the surroundings will be a huge factor on the game. Once the game starts I think the players will be focused on what is going on on the pitch. 'I still think there will be a great atmosphere. The stadium is sold out and the backing of the fans will be huge for us on a night when the expectation is higher than it has been and we have to rise to that.' Northern Ireland conspicuously failed to put away the lower ranked sides in World Cup qualifying, taking a miserable two points from 12 against Luxembourg and Azerbaijan. A 4-0 win against the Faroes on their last visit to Belfast in 2011 offers more reason for cheer, but O'Neill is not focused on past results. Lafferty celebrates after scoring against Hungary on September 7 in Budapest . O'Neill confers with his assistants, Jim Magilton (left) and Stephen Robinson (right) 'I don't think we can dwell on that,' he said. 'If you go back down the years there is always different groups of players and they know none of these games are straightforward. 'We have to play as well as we did in Budapest and with the same intensity and quality.' And captain Steven Davis also expects the side to learn from the mistakes of the past by beating the Faroe Islands on Saturday. 'I think we need to learn from the mistakes we have made in the past in games like this because we know we are capable of getting a result,' he said. 'I think we have to be disciplined. I think in the past we have got a bit ragged and lost our way so it's about using that experience and putting it into practice. 'I don't think it is a case of not being able to cope with it (being favourite). Players are playing at clubs where there is expectation placed on them all the time. Paddy McCourt (centre) leads the players during a session on October 10 in Belfast . 'It is all about showing that and there is a real determination in the squad to get the three points. 'It won't be easy but if we don't come off with three points we will feel as if we have failed and we don't want that to happen.' Davis admitted to watching England brush aside San Marino 5-0 on Thursday night as inspiration for the task ahead, but he realises the Faroes will expect to be more competitive than that in Belfast and is not expecting a similar goal-rush. 'I saw the majority of the England game and you can see at this level you will always come up against a team who are well organised,' he said. 'We expect the Faroes to be disciplined and I'm sure they will see this as an opportunity to get something as well, judging by their past results against some of the smaller nations. 'We aren't good enough to get carried away. We know our limitations and we know how we need to play and the effort we need to put in to get results, no matter who that is against. We need to be at it every game and get a bit of luck along the way.'","Northern Ireland beat Hungary 2-1 in their first Euro 2016 qualifier .

"Hull manager Steve Bruce believes Frank Lampard at his peak would have been worth up to £70million in the current climate. The former Chelsea midfielder has returned to centre stage with three goals in a week for Manchester City, who signed him on a short-term loan following his move to New York City. Lampard is the Blues' record goalscorer, netting 211 time in 13 years, and started his City tally with a dramatic strike against his previous employers last Sunday. He followed up with two more against Sheffield Wednesday in a 7-0 Capital One Cup thrashing and the Tigers are next up at the KC Stadium on Saturday. Frank Lampard is scheduled to return to parent club New York City FC from Manchester City in January . Steve Bruce (left), manager of Hull, has spoken highly of the Manchester City midfielder . Frank Lampard poses for a selfie with a fan during  City's Capital One cup clash with Sheffield Wednesday . Hull boss Bruce is full of admiration for the 36-year-old's achievements and thinks a young Lampard would be one of the most expensive players on the planet if he was on the market today. 'How much would Frank Lampard be worth now if he was in his pomp? A 20 goals a year man for the last 15 years? He'd be worth £60 or £70million,' said Bruce. 'He's been quite a remarkable player. Every young player with any aspiration in the game should maybe have a look at him. 'He's 36 now and his fitness levels are staggering. He's been a staggering player. 'Frank has been a great player for the Premier League. The word great is used too much but if you look at his record, he's been a phenomenal player. Still doing it now at 36 is incredible.'

"Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany believes the Barclays Premier League title race is destined to 'get messy' with Arsenal joining the champions and Chelsea in a three-way battle. Ten-man City fought back from a goal down to draw 1-1 with Jose Mourinho's table-toppers on Sunday, leaving the Londoners three points clear at the summit. Southampton and Aston Villa occupy second and third in the table but are unlikely challengers in the long run, meaning the Gunners and City look likeliest to lead the chase. Manchester City captain won his highly-anticipated duel with Diego Costa at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday . City's captain sees Sunday's opponents Chelsea as obvious title contenders alongside Londoners Arsenal . Arsenal are true title contenders according to Kompany, as the Gunners celebrate scoring at Villa Park . The weekend showdown at the Etihad Stadium was billed as the battle of the big hitters but Kompany believes Arsenal, who are one point better off than City and four off top spot, are ready to make it a scrap at the summit. 'It is not fair to call it at the moment,' said Kompany.' First of all we are not even close to Chelsea yet (in the table). Secondly, I have seen good things from Chelsea but I have seen maybe better things from Arsenal so I guess it will all be about consistency and, with the Champions League, it will get messy around December. 'It is too early to call. Five points is nothing but (Chelsea) have five points more than us, it is as simple as that. The Belgian captain and Diego Costa were involved in a titanic battle... which Kompany got the better of . 'But it will get messy in December and January as it always does - or at least the last six years I have been here it has.' Kompany was in commanding form on Sunday, shutting down Diego Costa in a manner no other defender has yet managed this season. It seemed improbable that Mourinho's side would have scored had Pablo Zabaleta not been sent off in the 66th minute, with Kompany well partnered by debutant Eliaquim Mangala. The £32million Frenchman has had a lengthy wait for his first taste of English football but was muscular and dependable in a tough opening assignment. Arsenal's Mesut Ozil and Danny Welbeck celebrate in the comprehensive 3-0 win at Aston Villa on Saturday . Eliaquim Mangala, on debut for Manchester City, was magnificent alongside Vincent Kompany in defence . 'He was tremendous. I don't think he's played for five months,' said Kompany. 'I think it is up to him how good he could be but it looks like he is eager to progress, which is important at his age (23) as he is still young. 'Obviously you can see he has all the basics to be more than a good defender. He will need some time, like everyone else, and with time he will improve. Going by this performance you will be looking forward to what he can achieve.' As for his own display, where he at times dominated seven-goal Costa, the City skipper added: 'I loved it. I live for those moments. Frank Lampard arrives late in the box to score City's equaliser and deny Chelsea three points at the Etihad . 'People who know me know I want nothing else than to play against the big strikers week in, week out and I enjoyed every minute of it.' While Zabaleta's red card eventually led to Chelsea's opener through Andre Schurrle, there was a dramatic finish in store as Frank Lampard stepped off the bench to level against his employers of 13 years. Having been cheered onto the pitch by the away fans, Lampard predictably declined to celebrate. He is only in Manchester until the new year, when he starts life at New York City FC, but Kompany is pleased to have a player of his stature around until then. 'I have said it before, he was looking really good in training and it is one more player with a lot of experiences, he has won a lot of trophies in his career and in moments like this he keeps his head cool and just finishes it,' he said. 'He could even have had a second but I guess that could have been a bit too much.'","Ten-man Manchester City held Chelsea 1-1 at the Etihad on Sunday .

"Hull manager Steve Bruce has ordered his side to 'get back to basics' after their careless exit from the Capital One Cup. The Tigers were 2-1 up at the Hawthorns until West Brom scored twice in the last three minutes to progress with a 3-2 win. In their last two Barclays Premier League matches Hull threw away leads against Newcastle and West Ham to draw both games 2-2 and it is becoming a concern for a side who prided themselves on defensive rigidity last season. Saido Berahino (right) knocked Hull City out with an 88th minute winner at the Hawthorns . One positive for Hull City was that Hatem Ben Arfa (left) was on the pitch for a full 90 minutes . The arrival of Manchester City at the KC Stadium on Saturday is hardly the easiest opportunity to prove that the message is sinking in, with Manuel Pellegrini's side having ran in seven unanswered goals against Sheffield Wednesday in midweek, but Bruce has laid down the challenge. 'It's a concern, of course it is, and it's hugely disappointing,' said Bruce. 'The things we've managed to do in the last couple of years, to get out of the Championship, stay up and get to the FA Cup final, have all been based around the ability to hang on to a lead, the ability to see it through. 'I can't remember in 16 years of management, or the 30-odd years I've been in football, where we've conceded such goals in the last couple of minutes to cost us. Gareth McAuley scored a minute before Berahino to level the scores in the 87th minute on Wednesday . West Brom's two goals in three minutes meant that they have thrown away three leads in their last three . McAuley wheels away in celebration after his equaliser for West Bromwich Albion . 'But it's our turn. At West Brom it's cost us our place in the cup. 'So we'll have to get back to basics, if that's what it is, the basics. 'We'll certainly have to defend properly on Saturday against a really outstanding team.' One positive from Hull's cup exit was the chance to see Hatem Ben Arfa on the pitch for a full 90 minutes. The Frenchman was an outcast at Newcastle before sealing a loan move on transfer deadline day and Bruce has been cautious about over-exposing the playmaker. A much-changed XI for the cup provided the chance to test his legs but Bruce believes more time is needed before he can be considered a regular starter. 'There's no question he can pick a pass, he's got fantastic ability, but we also have to bear in mind he hasn't really played since last February, which is a hell of a long time,' he explained. 'He might have a part to play on Saturday but there's a lot to do with his levels of fitness and he's still got a lot to do before we let him loose on the Premier League. 'It would be wrong of me to ask him to play two (full) games in four days when he hasn't played one in seven months. 'We have to box clever with him. Everybody knows what ability the kid's got and he'll be a big asset I'm sure, but we have to get him to the right fitness levels.'

"Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany believes Frank Lampard's dramatic equaliser against former club Chelsea could prove to be a pivotal moment in the title race. Lampard's late volley against the side he represented for 13 distinguished years kept City within five points of the leaders rather than an imposing seven. 'Ever since I have been at this club, seasons and big moments have been decided on small events like this one so I will never underestimate what it could mean to our season. It could be crucial,' Kompany said. Frank Lampard's goal against former club Chelsea could be key to the title race, says Vincent Kompany . After 13 years at Chelsea, Lampard's celebration was muted out of respect after he scored the equaliser . 'Frank brings quality. The goal he scored you would have seen from him for the last 15 years in the Premier League. 'He is clever and still extremely motivated. 'He brings experience. It is not a word you make up, it is something that helps and it is like his goal: keeping your head cool in a moment when you are under pressure and down to 10 men - how many players would have scored that goal? 'He has proven it himself in only a few minutes, which is good.' Lampard will not be around when the title race is settled, with a new life at New York City waiting for him in the new year, but Kompany believes both parties are getting a good deal from his short-term loan arrangement. Lampard beat former team-mate John Terry to a ball in the box before beating keeper Thibaut Courtois . Manchester City fans celebrate as Lampard walks away following his 85th-minute goal . 'I think it goes both ways. He needed what we can offer him and I think we needed what he can bring to us,' said the Belgium skipper. 'If you talk to him I reckon that's how he sees it as well and his goal was just the icing on the cake. 'Ultimately you play so many competitions you need all the guys to be there and he is another who will clearly make our team stronger.' The nature of the MLS schedule does offer the tantalising prospect of a future return for Lampard, though at 36 this would appear to be his farewell to English football. Kompany does not know if the chance will come again but has no doubts Lampard is still up to the task. 'That is not for me to judge, I think he has his personal plans as well, but I can base things on what I see day in, day out on the training ground and he is one of the better players,' the City skipper added. 'That is as simple as it is. The rest is not up to me.' City captain Kompany (left challenging Chelsea's Ramires) says titles can be decided by little moments .

"Steve Bruce may sympathise with Alan Pardew's pressurised position at Newcastle but the Hull manager still hopes to use it to his advantage when the sides meet on Saturday. The timing of Bruce's arrival at St James' Park could not be more awkward for all concerned, with the boyhood Newcastle fan touted as a possible replacement for Pardew should the axe fall. Significant fan protests are expected and Pardew himself has predicted 'mass hysteria'. Hull City boss Steve Bruce knows his side must capitalise on the turmoil at Newcastle on Saturday . Bruce experienced similar times at neighbouring Sunderland and would not wish them on a fellow boss but admits he is hoping to take a 'mercenary' advantage of the situation. 'I know what he's going through after being in the North East and it's not easy. It's not an easy place to manage,' he said. 'You genuinely feel for the manager in charge and at this moment (Pardew is) under the hammer, after only four games. A section of Newcastle supporters make their feelings know, printing thousands of 'sack Pardew' posters . Newcastle fans are becoming increasingly frustrated with Pardew's tenure, displaying several banners . 'We all understand it's a results based business but some of the nonsense that goes with it, I have to say is ridiculous. 'Unfortunately with the way social media is and the way the media is there is a huge appetite for what we call nonsense. It comes with the territory but you have to say in the North East it seems to quadruple: when there's a crisis, there's a crisis, and I suppose that comes from the huge support they have got. 'It's a difficult, difficult place to manage. But we have to try and take advantage of that, of course we do. We have to be mercenary enough to try and do that. 'The other stuff is not enjoyable to watch from afar. Over the years he's done a decent job has Alan but I think that's the nature of the beast, especially in the North East, and I can say that because I'm from there.'

"Hull manager Steve Bruce believes owner Assem Allam will ultimately be successful in his attempt to change the club's name to Hull Tigers. Allam revealed this week that he put Hull up for sale in April, within a day of the Football Association Council decision to reject his proposed rebrand. But the outspoken Egyptian has kept his options open by beginning a process of arbitration with the FA - not the Court of Arbitration for Sport as originally stated - and will remain at the helm his plans are upheld. Bruce has long played the pragmatist in the ongoing stand-off between Allam and disgruntled sections of the fan-base, but has always been adamant that the local businessman is a positive influence on the club. Assem Allam announced that he is trying to sell Hull City after the FA rejected his attempted name change . He is desperate to maintain what has thus far been a productive relationship - last season brought their highest-ever league finish and a first FA Cup final appearance - and expects arbitration to eventually yield a change from Hull City AFC to Hull Tigers. 'I think there will be a positive outcome. That means he will stay and he will win his case. I genuinely believe that will be the case,' said Bruce. 'Those are my thoughts. We have seen change before. One club (Wimbledon) went from London to Milton Keynes. Arsenal left Highbury...I never thought that would have happened back in the day. 'Or Manchester City leaving Maine Road. The fans even sang 'Maine Road till we die'. 'But they moved into a nice new stadium and everyone forgot about it. 'If he was looking to leave the KC and move to Sheffield, then I can understand there would be all sorts of arguments raging. It is business as usual for Steve Bruce who says the owner's views must be respected . 'But when you talk about a name change, there is an 'AFC' in there. 'Does that have to stay? For me, can we find a middle ground? I think we know now what the situation is so let's see what the Court of Arbitration says. 'But I think it has a long course to play.' Allam's son Ehab, the acting chief executive and vice-chairman, told Radio Humberside on Friday that he expected a resolution to the FA arbitration process by November. Allam senior has pledged his full commitment in the meantime, at least in the absence of a suitable buyer, and handed Bruce a bumper transfer kitty in the summer to prove the point. And should his appeal be thrown out again and he ultimately leaves the club, Bruce would expect his own future to be doubtful too. 'If he leaves and a new man comes in, then what will he want? They'll want their own man,' he said. Many Hull City fans oppose the name change but Allam is adamant that it must happen of he will leave . 'Of course, I don't want him to leave and I don't think the vast majority of the supporters do either. 'Like any good football club, the relationship the manager has with his chief executive or owner has to be strong. 'If it's not, then you can't work. I've got on well with him over the last couple of years because he's let me get on and manage. 'I'm fortunate enough to know that I never have any interference at all. Not in buying of players, team selection. He's never questioned why I played 4-3-3 or three at the back. Never. 'He's let me manage and that for me is a breath of fresh air when I hear about the madness that goes on around the world. 'I really genuinely feel like he doesn't want to sell but he feels that strongly on it (the Tigers issue). 'When you see him come out and tell the world, there is no turning back. 'I think he genuinely means what he says. That there is no grey area. But, as far as I am concerned, he has no real intention to sell. He doesn't want to sell but will do if forced into a corner.'","Allam says he will give the club away if he cannot find a buyer .

"Hull captain Curtis Davies is hoping Manchester City's quest for multiple trophies trips them up when the sides meet on Saturday. The Barclays Premier League champions visit the KC Stadium just three days before an important Champions League assignment against Roma and three after thrashing Sheffield Wednesday 7-0 in the Capital One Cup. While many of the champions' top-flight rivals used the midweek cup fixtures to rotate their squad, Manuel Pellegrini used nine of the players who had drawn with Chelsea last Sunday. Curtis Davies is hoping Hull City can spring a surprise on Manchester City due to their tight schedule . And Davies, whose side go in as heavy underdogs despite home advantage, hopes Manchester City's divided focus counts against them on this occasion. 'Manchester City have got such strength in depth so to see some of the players they used in the cup surprised me, they must really want to win that competition,' said Davies, who is a club ambassador for the Teenage Cancer Trust. 'When I saw they had won 7-0 that was pretty shocking but I'm hoping that come the weekend they've burnt their legs out a little bit. Davies tussles with Newcastle's Cheick Tiote during the Premier League encounter which ended in a draw . 'They're also looking forward to a Champions League game next week that they will feel they have to win and hopefully they might just take their eyes off the ball a little bit and if so we might be able to take advantage.' Despite the mitigating factor of the fixture list, Davies knows he will be coming up against opponents who are highly likely to be fighting for the title at the end of the season and will arrive in East Yorkshire with a confidence to match. But it is a challenge he has no intention of shirking. Hull's Curtis Davies tries to keep Enner Valencia at bay during their Monday night clash with West Ham . 'We're Hull City, they're Man City...you have to be honest, the onus is on them to do well,' he said. 'The onus will be on them to win every game and anything we can do to upset the apple cart is good for us. 'Anyone who wants to play in the Premier League should want to play against these players. If not you may as well stay in the Championship or League One, wherever. 'You come to the top level to test yourself against the best and there's not many better than Manchester City, with the (Sergio) Agueros and (Edin) Dzekos of this world. 'It's going to be difficult, you can never get away from that, but you have to thrive on that fact.' Hull could have hoped for easier opponents as they attempt to solve defensive problems that have seen them throw away winning positions four times this season, including each of the last three three matches. It may be too much to ask for a shutout this time around, but Davies is still expecting a significant improvement. 'I can't put my finger on what it is but for me as a centre-half it's very frustrating,' he said. 'Last year we worked on solid bases, keeping clean sheets and nicked a few 1-0s, but this year we're getting the required goals but we can't keep the clean sheets. 'We need to work on it as a back four and as a team because it's not good enough really.' :: Hull's charity partners for the 2014/15 season are the Teenage Cancer Trust.

"Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert has revealed that a move for Manchester United midfielder Tom Cleverley has not progressed. Lambert, speaking following Villa's impressive 2-1 win over Hull City, was honest in admitting that Cleverley is no nearer to joining the West Midlands side. 'There’s no update on that at the minute to be honest. He’s still Man Utd’s player. There’s nothing went forward on that,' Lambert revealed. En route? Aston Villa are interested in signing United outcast Tom Cleverley for £7 million . Win: Andreas Weimann celebrates his Villa goal against Hull on Sunday afternoon . The Scot went on to confirm that Karim El Ahmadi is close to sealing a move back to former club Feyenoord. 'El Ahmadi looks like he's going to sign for Feyenoord. He's been great for me since he's been here. It's a chance for him to go back, he's in his last year. 'We'd obviously lose him in the African Nations Cup so it'd make sense going back home. If we can do one or two lads to come in, then I'd look to do it.' Away from the transfer window, Lambert believes owner Randy Lerner's honesty over his desire to sell the club has contributed to their best Barclays Premier League start in eight years. Villa's 2-1 win over Hull, a scoreline that does not quite do justice to their dominance for the first hour, took them to seven points from a possible nine heading to the international break. That is their best opening three-game return since 2006/07 and a far cry from the embattled atmosphere that shrouded the club towards the end of last season. Some expected another year of struggle after American businessman Lerner put the club on the market in the summer, a move that has yet to lead to any concrete interest, but Lambert feels the transparency has helped everyone. 'I think what has helped is the chairman coming out and saying what he said,' explained the Scot. 'That's given people a clear picture of what is happening. 'Everybody knows the situation with the football club now, the way it is, it's out there. 'The chairman's being great, he's done everything he can here. Positive: Villa's win over Hull on Sunday afternoon made it seven points from a possible nine for Lambert's side . Gaffer: Lambert is very happy with the start that his side have made this season . 'The crowd have galvanised as well. They've realised if they stick with it and get right behind it I'm pretty sure we'll win more than not.' Villa endured a slightly nervy finale against Hull as Nikica Jelavic's deflected header halved a two-goal deficit created by the electric Gabriel Agbonlahor and Andreas Weimann inside 36 minutes. The hosts should have been home and dry by the hour mark, but saw Fabian Delph and Ashley Westwood denied by the woodwork. Lambert, whose side were dire at home last season, was content to focus on the positives of Villa's early dominance. 'I thought in the first half we were outstanding. If we'd scored another couple I don't think anyone could have begrudged us that and that would have made the second half a little more easy,' Lambert said. 'Gaby, especially in the first half, was unplayable today. Excellent. 'The movement of the midfield was terrific, the passing was so sharp, our willingness to go and win the game was excellent.'","Aston Villa are looking at signing Tom Cleverley for a fee around £7 million .

"Burnley boss Sean Dyche has warned Sunderland fans not to expect an easy ride at Turf Moor on Saturday. Both sides are awaiting their first victories of the season, meaning there is plenty riding on their meeting this weekend. For Dyche's men a season of struggle was always anticipated, but the Black Cats harbour higher hopes than a repeat of the relegation battle of last term. Burnley striker Danny Ings is yet to score a Premier League goal and has been ruled out for a month . Burnley have kept clean sheets in each of their last two games including against Manchester United . Away fans will see their trip to Lancashire as a big chance to get up and running, but Dyche has other ideas. 'Lots of Sunderland supporters will expect their team to beat us, and that does probably add a bit of weight to the game from their point of view,' he said. 'But I think that does us down a bit. Our record speaks for itself at Turf Moor, where we're pretty handy. 'I certainly don't think we're a team where you can just walk into Turf Moor and think it will all work out happily for you. 'You have to earn that right, certainly here, and I don't think Gus Poyet is naive enough to think otherwise. Burnley boss Sean Dyche says Turf Moor will not be an easy place for Sunderland to try and get a win . Julian Speroni saves Scott Arfield's penalty, denying Burnley their first win of the season at Selhurst Park . 'Some of their fans might think 'we've got to beat Burnley, simple as that' but I don't think it's that easy.' Dyche sees the fixture as a close call, one of several he is expecting against teams who exist outside the rarefied air of the Champions League positions. 'There's a reality to this division that suggests there's five or six - maybe seven or eight at most - who are right up there pushing, and outside of that there are ups and downs, moments of chaos,' he said. 'We're in that and we know it. 'I don't think Sunderland are market leaders either, like we're not, because there's only a small handful of teams who are up there at the very top. Sunderland twice came from behind to earn a point against Spurs and have drawn three games out of four . Sean Dyche says the Sunderland fans may expect to pick up their first win of the season against Burnley . 'There's a bigger group of teams who are up and down, in and out, where it's wins, draws and losses. 'You can't really put them (Sunderland) in a box but the fact is they're fighting to improve and challenging themselves to win games. 'Last year the main thing for Gus and his men was to get over the line and they did it.' One side who left Burnley with less than they hoped for this season were Manchester United. Louis van Gaal's side laboured to a 0-0 draw, the first of consecutive clean sheets for the Clarets. And that is a point of some pride for right-back Kieran Trippier. 'We're delighted with the two clean sheets in succession as a back five, including the goalkeeper Tom Heaton, and hopefully we can take that into the weekend,' he said. 'Last year we had the best defensive record in the Championship and hopefully we can try and do something similar this year.'","Sean Dyche says Sunderland fans will expect to beat his side .

"Steve Bruce lamented Hull's early exit from their first ever European campaign after being ousted by KSC Lokeren on away goals at the Europa League play-off stage. For a club who had so relished the chance to taste continental competition and all it had to offer there is something oddly fitting in their departure on a technicality that has defined European football for so long. The seeds of the Tigers' disappointment were sowed in Belgium last week, when Allan McGregor's error handed the hosts a 1-0 win. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Steve Bruce: We are disappointed but we have to move on . Down and out: Steve Bruce's European adventure with Hull is over after his side went out on away goals . Hull were at least victorious at the KC Stadium, Robbie Brady's first goals in almost a year enough for a 2-1 win but it was Jordan Remacle's strike that proved decisive. 'That's European football...we've experienced it and what it's all about, the frustrations, the disappointments, the away goal rule...,' said a rueful Bruce. 'To go out the way we did is the worst, away goals, but that's the competition. That's what playing in Europe is like. 'It's a totally different ball game and we didn't get to grips with it. 'To have had a big couple of European nights would have been terrific so it's a shame. 'It would have been a great adventure for everyone concerned. Goal: Robbie Brady scored twice for the Tigers but couldn't stop them going out of the Europa League . 'We've won the match and gone out on the rule but if we're being honest we didn't play to the levels I expect. 'We made far too many mistakes, we gave the ball away far too cheaply in really good areas and four or five didn't get to the level you would expect. That's the disappointing thing for me, even though we won the game. 'It's gone too quick for everyone but it's not to be so we move on.' Part of the moving on phase involves completing the transfer business Bruce had set in motion with half an eye on a gruelling group campaign. Captain: Curtis Davies reacts to Hull's exit from the Europa League - their first ever continental competition . Uruguay striker Abel Hernandez is close to coming in on a club record deal from Palermo. The player has passed a medical and agreed terms and a work permit hearing on Friday should determine if the deal can go ahead. 'Things are advancing quickly, we have to get work permits and bits and pieces done but we're trying hard,' said Bruce. 'The medical is okay, and personal terms, we just have to get through the red tape. 'There's still one or two issues to be ironed out. We'll see how we get on.'

"Kyle Lafferty and Niall McGinn were the late heroes as Northern Ireland marked the ninth anniversary of their famous victory over England by grabbing a dramatic 2-1 win in their Euro 2016 opener in Hungary. September 7 will always be a special day for Northern Ireland and ever more so after Lafferty bundled home the scrappiest, most ecstatic finish of his career to give his side a first away success in four long years. Hungary had looked set to take the points on their first outing at the new Groupama Arena when former Watford striker Tamas Priskin headed home a 74th-minute corner. Winner: Kyle Lafferty's 88th minute winner ensured the perfect start for Michael O'Neill . Victory: Michael O'Neill's side completed an unlikely comeback against Hungary in their opening qualifier . Hungary (3-4-3): Gulacsi; Vanczak, Liptak, Juhasz; Gyurcso (Lovrecsics 59), Varga, Tozser, Balogh; Rudolf (Kovacs 70), Nikolic (Priskin 46), Dzsudzsak. Booked: Vanczak . Northern Ireland (4-5-1): Carroll; McLaughlin, McAuley (Cathcart 72), Hughes, Brunt; Evans, Davis, Norwood (McKay 79), Baird, Ward (McGinn 79); Lafferty. Booked: Norwood . Referee: Deniz Aytekin (Germany) But Michael O’Neill’s men ripped up the script as Lafferty’s brilliant run and pass left McGinn with the simplest of tap-ins with 10 minutes to go. The pair then swapped roles with three minutes left, McGinn ghosting into the box and crossing for Lafferty, who willed the ball over the line as he tangled with Vilmos Vanczak and somehow got the job done from the most ungainly position. O’Neill sprang a tactical surprise by ditching his favoured 3-5-2 for something that threatened to be 4-3-3 but quickly reverted to a more defensive 4-5-1. The biggest gambles appeared to be at full-back, with Chris Brunt asked to fill in out-of-position on the left of defence and Conor McLaughlin handed a first competitive start on the right. There were chances at either end inside five minutes, but the finishing on each occasion suggested a goal-fest was never likely. Equaliser: Nial McGinn equalised just five minutes after Tamas Priskin had put the hosts in front . Opener: Hungary looked in control after Tamsa Priskin's opener, but that feeling didn't last . Lafferty created the first opportunity, battling to win Chris Baird’s cross and turning the ball deftly for the onrushing Jamie Ward. The Derby man had time to line up his shot but did not appear to realise it, snatching at the effort and sending it tamely towards Peter Gulacsi. There was more craft in Balazs Dzsudzsak’s attempt at the other end, opening his body to spray a first-time shot towards the far post, but it squirmed wide. Hungary took their time to settle in their new surroundings but gradually began to dictate terms, Dzsudzsak key to everything good and Adam Gyurcso giving Brunt a headache on the right wing. The home side were assisted by referee Deniz Aytekin, who pulled Northern Ireland up for a number of barely-there fouls. For the visitors, Ward’s terrier-like willingness to scrap for the ball looked the likeliest route. Group: The other Group F teams are Greece, Romania, Finland and the Faroe Islands . He pick-pocketed Zoltan Liptak inside the area only to be challenged before getting his shot away and then made what should have been his crucial intervention. He charged down an apparent lost cause on the halfway but got a kind deflection that put him in behind the home defence before sprinting for goal. When his shot was pushed out towards the middle of the box, Corry Evans should have buried it. Instead it came a little quicker than expected and sailed high over the crossbar off the midfielder’s instep. Evans had been the scorer when Northern Ireland last won away from home, 1-0 in Slovenia four years ago, but there was to be no repeat for him. There was a solitary change at the break as Priskin, once of Watford, came on up front for Hungary, soon to be joined by Gergo Lovrencsics. It was the latter who drew the first meaningful save of the game from Roy Carroll. Injury: Jamie Ward picked up an injury in the second half and Michael O'Neill was forced to replace him . That came with 62 minutes on the clock, Lovrencsics letting fly from the edge of the box and Carroll diving to his left to touch round the post. O’Neill went to bench by necessity, Ward and Gareth McAuley both taking knocks before being replaced by McGinn and Craig Cathcart. McAuley’s presence was surely missed as Hungary took the lead from a 74th-minute corner, Priskin getting the critical touch in a packed six-yard box. Dzsudzsak whipped in a wonderful set-piece but McAuley has made a career of making that area his own. They might easily have buckled but instead they mustered a grandstand finale. Managers: Michael O'Neill is hoping to take Northern Ireland to their first ever European Championships . Huge credit goes to Lafferty for the leveller, coming deep for the ball before navigating a roundabout way past the Hungary backline. When he opened his legs he quickly found a route into the penalty box, skipping one final challenge before measuring a pass across goal for McGinn to tap home unmarked. A point would have been a decent return on their day’s work but McGinn had other ideas, collecting Evans’ clever pass and looking for Lafferty at the back post. The finish was hardly elegant but for Northern Ireland it could not have been sweeter.","Michael O'Neill's side beat Hungary 2-1, their first away win in four years .

"Hull City boss Steve Bruce has confirmed his side are close to completing a club-record deal to sign Abel Hernandez from Palermo. The Uruguay international flew in for talks ahead of his proposed £9.5million move to the KC Stadium on Wednesday after Bruce turned his attention to Hernandez after failing to convince Blackburn Rovers to sell Jordan Rhodes. And it now appears Bruce has finally added a striker to his ranks after confirming the club have received a work permit for the 24-year-old. On the move: Hull are set to complete a deal for Palermo's Abel Hernandez for £9.5million . Move in doubt: Hull could lose out in the race to sign Manchester United midfielder Tom Cleverley . 'We expect the Hernandez deal to be completed before Monday's deadline,' said Bruce. 'We are just awaiting his signature. The work permit is already in.' Bruce also revealed he is hoping to add 'one or two players' to his ranks - but admitted he is struggling to sign Manchester United's Tom Cleverley. When asked if Hernandez was going to be the only signing on deadline day, Bruce replied: 'Never say never as we are still trying to do one or two bits. I can’t see us signing Cleverley. I don’t think it’s going to happen.' Bruce has given George Boyd permission to hold talks with Premier League new boys Burnley and expects the forward to sign a long-term deal at Turf Moor. 'It looks like Boydy will go to Burnley. We allowed George to speak to Burnley and personally I wish him well. 'He got an offer of a three or four year contract at Burnley and the chance to play. 'But I've been in the game a long time and if all professional footballers were like George Boyd my job would be easy.' Expected exit: George Boyd is closing in on a move to join Premier League new boys Burnley . Bruce also confirmed the signing of Cork City defender Brian Lenihan, although the 20-year-old is likely to go straight into the club's development squad rather than challenging for a first-team place. The 53-year-old was disappointed with his side's performance against Aston Villa on Sunday - labelling Hull's first-half display as the worst he has seen the Tigers play since he joined the club. 'We gave ourselves such a mountain to climb, the first-half performance was arguably the worst I’ve seen us perform in my two years here. 'Thankfully there was a response to that and we took the game to Villa in the second half. On another day we could’ve nicked something. I still can’t get over how bad we were in the first half because that was nowhere near our normal standard. 'I wont accept a performance where we were so lifeless - it was incredible. We were much better in the second half. It would’ve been a cricket score if we hadn’t woken up. We were that poor. 'I wish we could get them in on Monday but we can’t because 11 of our players are away on international duty. Mind you, they won’t be internationals if they keep playing like that.'

"Manager Steve Bruce has declared 'business as usual' at Hull despite owner Assem Allam's revelations that the club has been up for sale since April. Allam announced on Thursday that he put Hull on the market on April 10, less than a day after the Football Association Council rejected his proposals the rename the team Hull Tigers. The Egyptian has also set in motion an appeal against that decision with the Court of Arbitration for Sport and will stay in charge if successful. Assem Allam announced that he is trying to sell Hull City after the FA rejected his attempted name change . That seems to point towards a period of instability at the KC Stadium as both issues rumble on but Bruce insists nothing has changed from a footballing perspective. The manager has been aware of Allam's moves at every stage and remains convinced that going through with a sale remains a last resort for the outspoken 75-year-old. 'Deep down I know for a fact he doesn't really want to sell it but he feels that passionately about it (the Tigers rebrand) that we have to respect it,' said Bruce. 'I think for all of us here nothing has really changed, he's just reiterated his beliefs. 'So for me it's business as usual. It's been hanging around us now for six months. 'There was all sorts of rumours flying around that he'd already sold it and we all know the situation now. Let's get on with playing football and waiting for the CAS decision because I think that's going to be months away from what I can gather.' It is business as usual for Steve Bruce who says the owner's views must be respected . For Bruce, it all means a second straight season of fighting off-field fires while also keeping the team afloat in the Barclays Premier League. The Tigers row raged throughout last season, yet Bruce managed to lead the side to a first FA Cup final as well as a best ever league position. Part of the reason he is able to keep the show on the road may lie in the fact that he finds himself able to see both sides of the argument. 'We're all a little bit wary in this country of change because we're all huge traditionalists and so am I,' he said. 'But he (Allam) feels passionately that the club can move forward with a name change and that you have to respect. And of course the one thing we have to do when there is an argument is respect both sides. Many Hull City fans oppose the name change but Allam is adamant that it must happen of he will leave . 'In England we are wary of change, but I never thought 20-odd years ago that the big clubs would break away from the Football League and create the Premier League. I never thought Arsenal would leave Highbury and play at the Emirates. 'It's a difficult situation I find myself in always, but we all want one thing: for the club to get bigger and better and succeed. I hope the supporters will respect that there is an argument going on and find a middle ground.' Supporters' group City Till We Die, who had led protests against the name change, have made their response to Allam's latest outpourings. Allam spent heavily on the team this summer bringing in Abel Hernandez (left) and Mo Diame (right) They remain steadfastly against ditching the 110-year-old moniker of Hull City AFC but also respectful of Allam's commitment to financing Bruce's transfer plans. A statement from the group read: 'CTWD is disappointed to learn that Chairman Dr. Allam intends to appeal to the Court Of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). 'Hull City has enjoyed a period of relative stability since the FA turned down the name change application after a thorough and fair process. 'CTWD continue to support the Allams' ownership of the club. We remain grateful that in 2010 they secured the future of the club when it was uncertain and we appreciate their positive contributions to the club's history in the four years since. 'However we still see no justifiable reason to change the name of a football club that has existed and been a pillar of the local community since 1904 and we know that a significant number of the club's fans agree.' Hatem Ben Arfa could make his debut for Hull against West Ham this weekend but is unlikely to start .","Allam says he will give the club away if he cannot find a buyer .

"Ian Bell is confident England will not be sidetracked by the continuing row over James Anderson's conduct, suggesting his altercation with India all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja 'got blown out of proportion'. The row between Anderson and Jadeja during the first Investec Test at Trent Bridge is still casting a shadow as the series enters its fourth match at Old Trafford on Thursday. The issue appeared to reach a conclusion last week when both players were cleared by independent International Cricket Council commissioner Gordon Lewis, Anderson having been charged with a level three offence of pushing and abusing Jadeja, who escaped a lesser charge. Low key: Ian Bell believes the James Anderson and Ravindra Jadeja row has been blown out proportion . Back among the runs: Ian Bell hit 167 in England's previous test with India at Southampton . But while England are happy to let the situation lie, India have repeatedly registered their dissatisfaction with Anderson's behaviour and would like to see further action. Only the ICC chief executive Dave Richardson can now extend the process, by appealing Lewis' verdict, and an official statement from the governing body confirmed the Australian's ruling was under consideration ahead of Sunday's deadline. But Bell has been surprised by the furore having occurred during a series that he believes has been low on antagonism. 'Apart from one incident there's been nothing on the field at all, less than in other series I've played,' said Bell. 'It's a tough environment in the middle, there's always a bit and you hope it doesn't go past the line, but it's been played in a good spirit. 'Certainly a lot has been made of that issue. But like I said, from what I've been part of, there's been very little said apart from that one incident.' Fourth test awaits: Bell (left) takes part in a nets session with Joss Buttler (centre) and Alastair Cook . Shake on it: Ravindra Jadeja (left) and James Anderson shake hands during a series which has seen a feud develop between the pair following a row during the first test . The issue certainly had no effect on Anderson's performance during England's series levelling win at the Ageas Bowl last week, the 32-year-old claiming match figures of seven for 77. Having escaped a potential ban for his home Test, Anderson now has the opportunity to make India pay once again and Bell thinks he is primed to deliver. 'From Jimmy's point of view, and the players who were involved in it (the hearing), they'll do what they've done over the past couple of weeks, put that aside and concentrate on the cricket,' he said. 'The way Jimmy handled everything, to get man of the match at Southampton with everything around the corner afterwards, was an incredible effort. I'm sure he'll do exactly the same here, as will all the players. I'm sure we're desperate to get everyone talking about the cricket and a good series, rather than one incident that maybe got blown out of proportion.' Bell is one of England's least confrontational figures, though he is no stranger to being on the sharp end of a few well-placed barbs. Intimidated: Bell (centre) admits being affected by Shane Warne's verbal barbs during the 2005 Ashes . He was ruthlessly targeted by Shane Warne during his maiden Ashes series in 2005, and memorably nicknamed the 'Shermanator' after the American Pie character of the same name. Bell admits that episode of 'mental disintegration' had an effect on him but would not have it any other way. 'We've all copped it, we've all said things, we've all received things along the way,' he said. 'There's always a bit of banter when it's England-Australia and it should continue that way. 'Test cricket is a tough environment and sometimes you have to earn your respect. Certainly for me as a young player, I got taught a lesson by one of the best of all time (Warne). 'He noticed I was a young player, he put pressure on me to affect my performance and he did. I learned a massive lesson on how I needed to adapt to those situations. 'That's how it should be. You wouldn't want it to be easy out there.'","James Anderson and Ravindra Jadeja clashed in first Test .

That was not new information given his recent place in the Team Sky pecking order, but his subsequent suggestion that he may not ride another Grand Tour and focus solely on the track signalled a shift in tone. Wiggins also questioned the 'cut-throat' and 'political' nature of road cycling - comments which drew a frosty response of 'everyone is entitled to an opinion' from Brailsford. He refused to expand on that, but did suggest a Team Sky contract could still help Wiggins fulfil his Olympic ambitions. '(It could happen) in the same way we did it for Geraint (Thomas) and Pete Kennaugh. It's doable, that's for sure,' he told BBC Radio. 'Ideally (Wiggins will sign).

"Alex Bruce says Hull are 'quietly confident' of reaching the Europa League play-offs despite being held to a goalless draw by AS Trencin on Thursday night. The Tigers were favourites to beat their Slovakian opponents on their competitive continental bow in Zilina but came away from their third qualifying round first leg with a stalemate. Tom Huddlestone should have won it for the visitors but saw his 61st-minute penalty saved and somehow flashed a point-blank follow-up against the bar. Confident: Alex Bruce remains hopeful that Hull will advance to the Europa League play-offs . Bruce, who was one of City's most impressive performers in the centre of a back three, was not surprised the visitors did not get things their own way but is banking on a positive result at the KC Stadium to carry them through next week. Experience: Bruce has been around for a while . 'It was a tough game for us, particularly because we've only had a couple of friendlies and they are into their season,' he told Press Association Sport. 'Friendlies aren't the same as competitive matches so they were just that bit fitter than us, running round like whippets, which is a bit of a leveller. 'If it was during the season and we were at peak fitness and match sharp I'm sure we would have won quite handsomely. But we have had the benefit of that game now and I'm sure we'll be quietly confident of doing the job at home.' Huddlestone has missed spot-kicks before, in the FA Cup and Europa League while at Tottenham, but Bruce was surprised to see his side's dead-ball specialist falter from 12 yards. 'I think everyone in the ground thought it was going in, we all know how cleanly Tom strikes the ball,' he said. 'The second chance, I think he just thought it was too easy, a rush of blood. 'I'm sure he'll be beating himself up about it but we'd prefer him to do it in a game like last night when we've got another chance at home. 'We've missed a few penalties as a side so I'm going to start taking them, but then we really would be in trouble.' Hull handed debuts to summer signings Tom Ince and Robert Snodgrass in the second half against Trencin, and Bruce expects to see plenty more of them as his father Steve shuffles the pack this season. Improvement: Bruce produced some sterling performances for Hull last season . He added: 'We could have a lot of games this year so it's important to have a big squad and utilise that for each game. 'The new lads did have a bit of impact when they came on and we need to keep it fresh.

Just 10 balls were bowled by West Indies in that Test, the second to be held at the venue, before it was called off due to an unsafe outfield caused by excess sand. A game was subsequently held at short notice at the nearby Recreation Ground while the SVRS was banned from hosting international cricket for 12 months.

It will now play home to the first of three Tests against England on April 13, followed by the tourists' maiden Test in Grenada and a series-ending trip to Barbados. The itinerary represents a marked change from the West Indies Cricket Board's initial plans, which had included games in Guyana and Jamaica. The omission of Barbados' Kensington Oval, a favoured stop off of the travelling Barmy Army, had seemed an eccentric decision and has been rectified after the matches were re-tendered by the WICB. Paul Downton, managing director England cricket, said: 'We thank the West Indies Cricket Board for their assistance with the organisation of the tour and we know the venues will prove extremely popular with the thousands of cricket lovers who follow England to the Caribbean.

"Sir Bradley Wiggins will race for gold on his track cycling return this evening, with England facing off against favourites Australia in the team pursuit final at the Commonwealth Games. Wiggins joined Ed Clancy, Andy Tennant and Steven Burke to qualify second fastest at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome, turning in a comfortable time of three minutes 59.249 seconds. That was enough to send New Zealand and Canada into a battle for bronze, but Australian quartet Jack Bobridge, Luke Davison, Alex Edmondson and Glenn O'Shea flexed their muscles by bettering England's mark by almost two seconds as they clocked 3mins 57.939secs.

The same cannot be said of the men's sprint, where a sensational qualifying effort from the Australasian contingent left the home nations playing catch-up. Australia's Matthew Glaetzer set a new Commonwealth Games men's sprint record as the mark was lowered five times in qualifying. Glaetzer, 21, topped the timesheets with 9.779secs, while compatriot Peter Lewis and New Zealand trio Ed Dawkins, Sam Webster and Matthew Archibald all bettered Shane Perkins' previous mark of 10.058secs, set in Delhi four years ago. The quintet made it a tough session for the rest of the field, who were led by England's Olympic team sprint champion Philip Hindes in sixth place.Triple Olympic champion Jason Kenny was pushed into 11th place in 10.206s. Unlucky: England's Kenny could not beat New Zealand's Webster but settled for Games silver . Nearly: Kenny got a 'funny feeling' and a 'bit of cramp' during the race at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome .

"Doncaster defender Luke McCullough would welcome One Direction star Louis Tomlinson as an investor, having seen his passion for the club at first hand. Reports have emerged in the past week that boy band heartthrob Tomlinson, 22, is interested in buying Rovers, who he has supported since childhood. It is the latest development in the former X Factor contestant's love affair with his hometown club, which previously saw him sign non-contract terms as a player and turn out for the reserve team in February. All smiles: One Direction's Louis Tomlinson has made a formal bid to buy League One side Doncaster Rovers . Backing: Doncaster defender Luke McCulloch, pictured during his time with Manchester United, would welcome Tomlinson as an investor in the club . Tomlinson's substitute appearance, in aid of Bluebell Wood Children's Hospice, put 5,000 on the usual gate for Doncaster's second XI and gave an insight into the kind of interest he can generate. McCullough, currently in Chile on Northern Ireland's South American tour, played alongside Tomlinson that night and was left in no doubt about the singer's motives. 'Louis is from Doncaster, he's a nice quiet local lad and a fan of the club so it must have been a dream for him to play,' he said. 'It was a strange atmosphere, thousands of young girls screaming through the match trying to get a glimpse of him. 'He was just helping the club, doing his bit for Donny, because he's a fan. It was good for the charity and good for Rovers too. 'It raised the profile of the club and the Twitter following has gone through the roof. It's definitely put us on the map a bit more.' Having experienced the 1D effect at close quarters, McCullough, who had to ask Tomlinson for his autograph on behalf of his sister, would have no qualms about him taking a more substantial role. 'He's made a lot of money for himself and he's broken America but he's a season ticket holder,' he said. 'It would probably be a dream for him to be involved with the club and as players we don't mind who runs it.' Lifelong fan: Tomlinson, who was born in Doncaster, made a professional appearance for the reserve team in February after signing to the club's books last summer . Plans: Tomlinson has joined forces with businessman John Ryan, who previously owned the club before selling off a large share to a consortium .","Doncaster defender Luke McCulloch would welcome One Direction star Louis Tomlinson as an investor .

"Tom Moody has revealed he was not ready to return to international cricket when the England coaching job came up this year and warned that Alastair Cook's team is suffering from a lack of participation in the Indian and Caribbean Premier League. The former Australia international was on the England and Wales Cricket Board's shortlist to replace Andy Flower but opted out of the process after tentative discussions. Another Australian, Trevor Bayliss, was the only overseas candidate interviewed by the ECB, who were keen to appoint a homegrown coach, but Moody's formidable CV would surely have made him a strong contender. Too soon: Former Australia international Tom Moody has revealed that he was not ready to become England head coach . Instead, Peter Moores returned to the post and Moody continued his role with IPL franchise Hyderabad Sunrisers as well as a new job as director of cricket at the CPL, which begins on July 11. Outlining his decision to stand aside, the 48-year-old said: 'I had conversations with the ECB but I made the decision not to continue my interest in the position. 'I'm very fortunate to have some incredibly exciting jobs with the CPL, the IPL and in the media and I wasn't ready to make the leap of faith back into international coaching. 'Who knows, I may have thrown my hat in and come fourth or fifth. 'Like most things in life it was down to timing, and it wasn't right for me, but it's an incredibly attractive job and I certainly wouldn't close the door on international coaching in the future.' As for the scale of the job he decided against pursuing, Moody sees both an intriguing challenge and a difficult set of circumstances. Wanted man: Former Sri Lanka coach Moody was on the ECB's shortlist to take over from Andy Flower . The idea of regenerating a side that was partially dismantled as a result of the Ashes whitewash last winter is an appealing one to him, but he is mindful of the fact that England's schedule rules most players out of joining other global stars at the IPL and CPL. 'England is a very attractive job right now because any job where you're coming in at the rebuilding stage is exciting,' he said. 'There's an opportunity to put your thumb print on the team, on the brand of cricket you want, on the values you think are important. 'But losing to Sri Lanka last month was a bit of a wake-up call and when the India series starts (on Wednesday) it's not a given that it's just going to be a home-patch win. 'Teams are getting wiser and smarter about playing in other parts of the world and franchise cricket - the IPL, the CPL - is a lot to do with that. Room for improvement: Moody believes Alastair Cook's side are struggling because of a lack of participation in the IPL and CPL . 'It's a lot of international players sharing a dressing room, breaking it down. 'England's summer is the reason they can't do that and, forgetting about the financial side, they are missing out on a unique opportunity. 'These competitions are the best learning experience you can have as a player or a coach. 'Take a young player like Jos Buttler...if he's not there there's no doubt his progress is not going to be as rapid as someone who is getting those experiences.'

"Most Premier League footballers with time to spare during the international break would probably spend Friday night at one of London's exclusive bars... not taking in a show at the Royal Opera House. This former England international tweeted a picture taken from the balcony seat of his salubrious surroundings, accompanied by the caption: 'Date night at the @RoyalOperaHouse.' The curtains were about to be raised on Philip Glass' sell out show The Trial, based on a novel by Franz Kafka - which is unlikely to be on your average player's list of favourite books.

They do not say what for and over the next year he desperately tries to find out what he's been accused of, why he's been accused and if there is any way to escape his fate. While you may be expecting the Premier League's culture vulture to come from a sophisticated part of the continent, you'll probably be surprised to hear it is actually West Ham winger Matt Jarvis.

"Former Manchester United manager David Moyes rates Adnan Januzaj alongside Wayne Rooney as the best young talent he has ever seen.

Waddle used to slow you down and make you feel comfortable and before you knew it he was gone. Adnan has that. He can eliminate people. 'Wayne was different but in the same way as we saw something special in him at Everton we saw that in Adnan Januzaj. I can only see the boy going right to the top.'

"Uruguay defender Diego Godin insists his side will not be underestimating England at the World Cup despite the lack of hype around Roy Hodgson's squad. The Three Lions join Uruguay, Italy and Costa Rica in Group D and face La Celeste in their second match on June 19.

'England do not talk much but I think it is a very strong team with players going through a great time. 'They are at a high level and it is going to be very difficult.

"Southampton midfielder Steven Davis was sad to see Mauricio Pochettino leave for Tottenham, but does not believe it represents the end of the club's rise to prominence. Saints excelled under Pochettino last season, finishing in eighth place in the Barclays Premier League and drawing admiring glances across the board for their style of play. Such success was always likely to attract interest from elsewhere and, like their former manager, the likes of Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw and Jay Rodriguez have all been linked with high-profile transfers this summer.VIDEO Scroll down to see Mauricio Pochettino confirmed as new Tottenham manager . Belief: Steven Davis reckons that Southampton can continue to progress without Mauricio Pochettino . Unveiled: Mauricio Pochettino has made the move from Southampton to Tottenham . Northern Ireland captain Davis, who found out about Pochettino's departure while on international duty in Uruguay, admits it is a tough time but expects the structure that exists at St Mary's to continue yielding benefits. 'It's a blow for everybody to lose him, you can't really get away from that, and the players all loved working for him,' said Davis. 'He pushed us on from where we were at before he came in; everyone personally improved, results improved as well and things were looking bright for the future. 'It's disappointing but at the same time I don't think it will affect the club in terms of progression because there is still a lot of growth left in the team. 'The club has come a long way in the last five years and the blueprint has been evident under each and every manager. 'There is no reason why that should stop now and everyone will want to get going forward to achieve our goals.' Moving: Luke Shaw and Adam Lallana are two of Southampton's young stars that have been tipped for a move . Outgoing: And Jay Rodriguez would have been another were it not for his injury . Whether Southampton continue to grow and defy expectations is likely to depend in large part on how successful they are in rebuffing interest in their star assets from the likes of Manchester United, Liverpool and now Pochettino's Tottenham. Dream moves for the likes of Shaw and Lallana to Old Trafford and Anfield have been mooted for some time now, but Davis is not treating their departures as a done deals. 'I'm sure the owners will be doing their utmost now to get the best person possible in and ensure the we can keep the squad together,' he said. 'There's obviously rumours even before the manager left and that was well documented but that was based on us having a really good season. 'You can't stop that and it's always difficult if a top four club comes in to keep a hold of them, but I always felt all the players bought into what the club is trying to achieve and everyone is happy there. Battler: Davis fighting West Brom's Youssouf Mulumbu (left) and James Morrison for the ball .

"Chile completed their World Cup preparations with victory over Northern Ireland after two late goals in Valparaiso. Michael O'Neill's visitors held their own for 80 minutes but saw their brave resistance broken by substitutes Eduardo Vargas and Mauricio Pinilla.

As with Northern Ireland's 1-0 defeat . in Uruguay last week, it was a performance O'Neill could take heart from . - not least after a pair of first-half free-kicks that might have given . his side the lead. But it was still another loss and a fourth successive outing without scoring. As it was, Northern Ireland almost ended their drought in the opening seconds, when the ball fell kindly for Billy McKay. The Inverness striker managed a clean connection from 25 yards but Johnny Herrera was well placed to make the save. That aside, Chile dictated the pace and looked to starve their opponents of possession. For . Northern Ireland, only Steven Davis' tireless running kept his side's . heads above water, with the captain covering every inch of grass and . stifling a handful of attacks with timely challenges.

Indeed, . it was Northern Ireland who went closest to breaking the first-half . deadlock from a pair of free-kicks won by the industry of Ryan . McLaughlin - starting for the first time - on the right wing. Brother . Conor McLaughlin's 20th-minute header, from Shane Ferguson's tempting . delivery, was destined for the net had Herrera not made a smart save. Oliver .

For all their territorial superiority, Fabian Orellana's scuffed effort was the best Chile could do in response. As . the hour mark approached, Jorge Valdivia saw what appeared to be a . cross veer towards the top corner and thought he had scored until . Carroll backtracked and clawed to safety. Moments . later, Sanchez made his belated arrival and was almost gifted a bizarre . winner when Conor McLaughlin's clearance cannoned off him and needed a . sprawling save from the alert Carroll. Valdivia . should have scored moments earlier but headed against the post after . Gary Medel's flick left him with a six-yard finish. The . strength of Chile's bench eventually told, Sanchez's chipped . through-ball teeing up Vargas for the headed opener 10 minutes from . time.

"Sam Allardyce says Louis van Gaal didn’t offer him a drink after West Ham’s defeat at Manchester United last weekend. After United’s 2-1 victory at Old Trafford, the West Ham manager waited to have a drink with Van Gaal – a tradition Sir Alex Ferguson was fond of during his reign – but no offer was forthcoming from the Dutchman. And Allardyce says he was 'disappointed' by the snub. VIDEO Scroll down for Sam Allardyce's thoughts on match referee . Louis van Gaal greets Sam Allardyce (R) before the game, but there was no meeting afterwards . The West Ham manager admitted being 'disappointed' by what seems to be the end of a tradition at United . Allardyce recalls Sir Alex Ferguson always extended the courtesy of a glass of wine after the game . Writing in his column in theEvening Standard, the Hammers boss said: 'I always invite the visiting manager into my office for a drink and a chat after a home game. 'Which is why I was surprised and, yes, disappointed, that there was no such invitation following our match at Old Trafford last weekend. 'When all was done and dusted after the match, I went to where Sir Alex Ferguson was invariably waiting with a glass of wine — and everything had changed. I think the room is now used for analysis. 'I was told it didn’t happen any more, so I said “fair enough” and left.' Robin van Persie is congratulated by Luke Shaw after scoring what turned out to be the winner . Captain Wayne Rooney (C) was given his marching orders for a rash kick on Stewart Downing . United have agreed personal terms with Radamel Falcao over a proposed summer transfer .

Having paid a loan fee of £6million to the French club for the 28-year-old, United have also agreed to a transfer fee of £43.5m if they decide to take the striker permanently at the end of the season.

"Christopher Samba asked not to play in the second half of the Moscow derby between Dynamo and Torpedo on Monday after being subjected to a torrent of racial abuse. The former Blackburn and QPR defender, now at Dynamo, did not go out after the interval, with club vice-president Gennady Soloviev saying: 'I can confirm Samba felt offended with Torpedo fans and didn't want to go on the pitch for the second half. 'That's why he was replaced.' Christopher Samba (L) asked not to play in the second half of the Moscow derby after being racially abused . Dynamo defeated their local rivals 3-1, although manager Stanislav Cherchesov had claimed that Samba had been substituted because of a calf injury. Samba spent six years with Blackburn before moving to the Russian Premier League with Anzhi Makhachkala. He returned to England for an unsuccessful loan spell with QPR before signing for Dynamo Moscow last year. Samba spent six seasons with Blackburn Rovers before moving to the Russian Premier League . This is not the first time Samba has suffered racist abuse in Russia. In January 2013 while playing for Anzhi a fan threw a banana on the pitch - with Samba responding by throwing it back into the stands.

"CLICK HERE to see all the stats from the big game with our brilliant Match Zone . If Manchester United fans were wondering what they may be missing from Nani, the answer is the same old feints and flicks... accompanied by an ultimate sense of frustration. It's fair to say that the Portuguese winger failed to live up to expectations at Old Trafford before agreeing a loan move back to his former club Sporting Lisbon. He was back in action against Premier League opposition when Chelsea travelled to the Estádio José Alvalade for their Champions League group G clash - with contrasting performances in each half. Nani was practically anonymous during the first half back came to life in the second half against Chelsea . Nani was left ultimately frustrated at the end of the game, a feeling Manchester United fans will remember . The Sporting Lisbon winger practices ahead of the Champions League clash with Chelsea . 0 - 5mins: The 27-year-old started on the wing - where he has spent most of his career at both club and international level playing under the shadow of another Sporting alumni Cristiano Ronaldo - and his first touch involved a typically jinking move that ultimately lacked an end product. 9mins: Nani temporarily switched wings with Andre Carillo, who had been the more impressive going forward on the rare occasion that Sporting managed to break, but struggled to get any time on the ball as Chelsea dominated early proceedings. 18min: As elder statesman, Nani's younger teammates repeatedly tried to search him out in what appeared to be a free role across the front. His simple pass to Jonathan Silva led to a scoring opportunity wasted by Islam Slimani - but Nani lost possession only moments later and Sporting were fortunate that Andre Schurrle was in another profligate mood. The former Manchester United forward struggles to find a way past Filipe Luis on the wing . Nani exchanges pleasantries with fellow Portuguese and Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho . 33mins: Not one renowned for his defensive capabilities, Nani was nowhere to be seen as former Benfica midfielder Nemanja Matic opened the scoring with a solid header from a floated cross by Cesc Fabregas. 37mins: Nani attempted to beat Branislav Ivanovic for pace down the left touchline in a battle re-enacted from his time in England, but the Chelsea defender used his strength to usher the ball out for a goal kick. 41mins: As half-time approached, the closest Nani came to being compared with Ronaldo is petulantly complaining with his hands on his hips when Adrien Silva opted for a shot instead of passing to him. HT: Manchester United fans will recognise a first-half performance that saw Nani roam freely around the pitch playing subtle passes without actually imposing himself on the game or penetrating the areas that matter. Nani receives close attention from Chelsea's Nemanja Matic (C) and Branislav Ivanovic (L) Nani played in a free role without penetrating in the first-half - CLICK HERE for more Match Zone stats . Nani's first-half heat map shows him flitting around the pitch without influencing the danger areas . Matic (L) opened the scoring with a header in the first-half with Nani nowhere to be seen . 47mins: Nani took his first shot with a whipped effort from a standing position that raised the commentator's voice before a different angle revealed the ball swerving well wide of Thibaut Courtois' goal. 49mins: In a move that perfectly illustrates why Nani frustrates, he raced down the left wing after taking the ball in his stride with a beautifully deft touch but, once inside Chelsea's penalty area with options available, he decided on a back heel... after confusing the referee for a teammate! 50mins: Sporting definitely looked more dangerous after the interval and Nani saw far more of the ball. Another raid down the left was halted by a shove from Felipe Luis that was seen by everyone except the referee who failed to award a deserved free-kick on the edge of the area. Nani takes down the ball with a deft touch before racing past Cesc Fabregas (R) Nani's general (L) and attack (R) statistics from the game reveal no crosses or shots on target . The Sporting winger is easily shrugged off the ball by the more robust Chelsea defender Ivanovic . 54mins: Nani missed a superb chance to level the scoring after racing on to a loose ball on the left of the penalty area but his composure deserted him with Courtois racing out and the ball could only find the side netting. 60mins: A nicely placed free-kick was lifted tamely into the wall by Nani before he lost possession from the rebound and almost allowed Chelsea another break away before Diego Costa was cynically brought down. 65mins: Nani tried to switch play with a raking cross field pass to Carillo but it was slightly over hit, allowing Oscar to cover enough ground to intercept. The 27-year-old does his best Cristiano Ronaldo impression after teammates fail to find him with a pass . Nani misses a chance at the beginning of the second half after latching on to a loose ball in the box . 71mins: Eden Hazard is cautioned for tripping Nani from behind as Sporting continue their second half resurgence. 78mins: Nani conceded a free-kick after tumbling over Willian on the byline in a rare show of tracking back. 81mins: The Portuguese winger had another shot but could not get enough pace or direction on the ball to trouble Courtois . 86mins: In his best effort of the night, Nani cut inside from the right and ghosted past three defenders before unleashing a superb dipping effort that sailed agonisingly over the crossbar. FT: Sporting and Nani came to life at the beginning of the second half with the winger seeing far more of the ball and dictating more of the play while coming close with a couple of decent efforts. However, none were on target while his final product still leaves much to be desired - and Manchester United fans won't be losing any sleep after a typical performance coined by inconsistency.

"Not many people manage to steal the spotlight from Ian Poulter during the Ryder Cup, but  Lee Westwood managed to upstage his teammate with a well-timed photobomb at Gleneagles. The former world No 1 crept up behind Poulter and his wife Katie ahead of the official opening ceremony to play the prank while Europe's talisman looked ahead none the wiser. The relaxed nature of Europe's finest should stand them in god stead to retain the trophy when hostilities against the USA resume on Friday. Lee Westwood photobombs teammate Ian Poulter and wife Katie ahead of the Ryder Cup opening ceremony . Poulter acknowledges the support as Europe's players are introduced during the opening ceremony . When it comes to the competition, Poulter is renowned as Mr Ryder Cup or The Postman (because he always delivers) as the 38-year-old seems to grow in stature during the trans-Atlantic battles. The Englishman has been Europe's leading points scorer in the last three meetings and was the team's inspirational talisman who sparked the miracle at Medinah two years ago. For that reason, US team captain Tom Watson has identified him as the statement scalp to chase - a comment that Poulter regards as a compliment . 'As someone that has loved the Ryder Cup I take Tom Watson's comment as a huge compliment,' said Poulter. 'I'm very proud of my record and proud that I've put a lot of blue on the board. 'I'm passionate as a team player to be mentioned with the likes of Seve (Ballesteos) and Monty (Colin Montgomerie) and those players is an absolute honour. 'I'm not sure whether I transform (in a Ryder Cup) but I love it and I enjoy what it stands for and I embrace that. Poulter shares a joke with teammate Justin Rose during a final practice session before the big event . World No 1 Rory McILroy shakes hands with Sergio Garcia after being named partners in the fourballs . 'My record in the Ryder Cup is exceptional and my stroke play record isn't, so quite clearly I've struggled to take what I have in the Ryder Cup and put that out for 103 other weeks in between them. 'It's hard but (you have) to realise that what every putt means in the Ryder Cup is the equivalent of winning a tournament and the emotion that goes through your body is the same as the putt that you experience on a Sunday in a big tournament. 'Potentially, you're holing lots of winning tournament putts throughout a three-day spell and sometimes that all adds up to more wins than you would ever have in your professional lifetime.' Poulter enters this Ryder Cup, his fifth, with expectation weighing heavier than ever before on his shoulders, purely on the basis of the role he played in 2012. Poulter comes to life at the competition earning him the nicknames Mr Ryder Cup and The Postman . Europe's players celebrate their unlikely comeback victory in the so-called 'Miracle of Medinah' in 2012 . It cannot be underestimated how significant his run of five birdies in the last five holes to win the Saturday afternoon fourballs with Rory McIlroy was with the United States leading 10-4 at that point. That was both the beginning of the most remarkable comeback in the history of the event and the start of Poulter's step towards Ryder Cup greatness. As a man not short of self-confidence the Englishman is happy to carry the burden which will undoubtedly be on him this weekend. 'I put enough pressure on myself leading in and I work hard to be able to deliver in Ryder Cups,' he added. 'I put more pressure on myself than the millions or billions of people who are out there wanting me to hole putts. 'I'm very demanding of what it is I have to do out there and deliver upon and I feel that I can manage that level within myself, because that's what I expect to do. Europe's Martin Kaymer laughs off the attention of an enthusiastic fan during practice at Gleneagles . Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp (L) and Kenny Dalglish enjoyed themselves in the Pro-Celebrity Challenge . 'From all the previous Ryder Cups that I've witnessed, being there from 1993, I don't think negatively. 'I think positively that we are going to go out there and deliver. I never feel that I'm going to go out there and think 'What if something doesn't happen?' It's more to the point of 'Let's go out there and do the job'. 'You don't need to control it. You've been waiting for it for a long time so you just need to grab hold of it and let it go.'

"Bearded talisman Arda Turan reignited Atletico Madrid's Champions League campaign when he struck 15 minutes from time to give last season's beaten finalists a 1-0 win at home to Juventus in Group A on Wednesday. Beaten 3-2 at Olympiacos in their opening game two weeks ago, Atletico hassled and harried the Italian champions at the Calderon and were rewarded in the 75th minute when Turkey midfielder Arda poked the ball into the net from close range. The stocky playmaker, who scored a superb winner in this month's 2-1 La Liga win at European champions Real Madrid, settled an intense encounter in the Spanish capital in which neither side created many clear chances.

Referee: Felix Brych (Germany) It was the first time the Juventus defence has been breached this season and the first goal their Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon has conceded since Atletico's Uruguay defender Diego Godin beat him at the World Cup finals in Brazil in June. The victory puts Atletico firmly back on track to qualify from a group that also includes Malmo. The Swedish side won 2-0 at home to Olympiakos to leave all four teams on three points from two matches. 'It was a match full of passion against one of the best teams in Europe,' Atletico fullback Juanfran said in an interview with Spanish television. 'We did some great work and the win was deserved,' added the Spain international, who provided the cross from the right wing for Arda's goal. The Atletico fans unveiled a banner reading 'Feared in Europe' shortly before kickoff and the home players went after Juventus from the start.

The Serie A side had the lion's share of possession and came close to a late equaliser when Atletico captain Raul Garcia almost turned a Stephan Lichtsteiner cross into his own net. 'We have to improve in order to create more opportunities to score in away games like this,' Buffon told reporters. 'I think we were controlling the game quite well but we probably had to be braver and go for the victory instead. 'It was a very balanced game. We did not create many opportunities to score but I think the draw would have been a fair result. 'Atletico are known for not giving you space.

Although he has collected silverware at the Bernabeu, including the elusive tenth European Cup - La Decima - recent complaints regarding the club's transfer policy have given supporters hope.

However, the 29-year-old appeared to dismiss the notion of a return after his latest starring performance in scoring four goals during Real Madrid's 5-1 victory over Elche on Tuesday.

Schalke wasted several chances to bring themselves back into the game before the post denied Brown from netting his hat-trick - but the rebound fell kindly to Aina to secure a deserved victory. The Germans had substitute Hendrik Lohmar sent off for a second bookable offence shortly after but the result was never in question by that stage.

"England's impressive 2-0 victory over Switzerland in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier saw viewing figures return in the TV ratings stakes. A brace from Arsenal's new signing Danny Welbeck not only restored the team's confidence, but also recaptured the nation's interest after last week's dull international friendly against Norway. On that occasion, the BBC's Great British Bake Off programme attracted almost twice as many viewers, with an average figure of 8.3million compared to 4.5million for the game. Back in favour: England's victory against Switzerland saw viewers tune in to watch the game again . Resolve: England fans have started to recover from the hangover of a dreadful World Cup in Brazil . The reasons for the downfall in interest, which also saw only around 40,000 spectators travel to Wembley, was blamed on England's dismal performance at the World Cup where Roy Hodgson's side were eliminated after only two games. However, the figures for the more meaningful fixture shown on ITV on Monday rose to an average of 5.6m - beating the 4.9million who watched the BBC series New Tricks.

"Michael Essien has backed  teammate Fernando Torres to score 'lots of goals' at AC Milan after the former Chelsea pair were reunited at the San Siro. The Spain international's time at Stamford Bridge will always be classed an expensive mistake after he failed to live up to his prolific reputation following a £50million move from Liverpool in 2011. However, Essien claims that the 30-year-old has been working hard in training and will rejuvenate his stalled career with the Serie A side. Torres takes on Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal in Serie A match between AC Milan and Juventus . Spain international's time at Stamford Bridge will not be remembered as a success . 'I really hope he does well for Milan and for himself because he's a top striker and we'll benefit from his goals. 'He's a hard worker both in games and in training and that can also serve him well at Milan,' Essien told fifa.com. 'One thing Milan can expect to see is 100 per cent all the time from him. I am convinced we'll see lots of goals from Fernando,' he added. Essien's final seasons with the Blues were equally lacklustre after the Ghana international struggled to recover from a series of career threatening injuries before signing for the Rossoneri on a one-and-a-half year contract in January. Michael Essien (L) left Stamford Bridge after seasons struggling with form and fitness . Jose Mourinho has created a team in his own image that can be a force in Europe for next decade . The midfielder, known as 'The Bison', bears no ill feeling towards his former club and believes influential manager Jose Mourinho has constructed a team that can be a force in Europe for the forseeable future. Asked how he thinks Chelsea will perform this season, Essien said: 'I think they'll do well as always. Jose has rebuilt the team in his own image now and they'll fight for everything this season. 'They have to ability to win things and that’s what they'll be doing.

"Bradley Wiggins will be the first time trial specialist to have a go at the hour record under new regulations, the Briton said on Wednesday. 'I want to have a go at the one hour record next year after what Jens (Voigt) did last week,' the 2012 Tour de France champion told the BBC. 'I was a bit surprised by Jens's decision to do it but what he did was fantastic and fully deserved. I could just go and do it next week but, if I do it, I'll only do it once.' Bradley Wiggins, winner of the Tour de France 2012, has said he will try and beat the one-hour record . The record was beaten by German Jens Voigt last week, and now Wiggins (pictured front) wants to beat it . Last week, German Voigt beat the previous mark set by Czech Ondrej Sosenka in 2005 as the first rider to make an attempt under new rules set by the International Cycling Union (UCI). Voigt's record of 51.115 km followed a revision by the UCI of the rules, introduced in 2000, governing equipment used in the celebrated competition. The UCI said in May the record could be beaten on a bike that complies with current rules for machines used in endurance track events. Voigt joined a prestigious list of record holders for the event ranging from the first officially established in 1893 by Henri Desgrange to Fausto Coppi, Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx and Francesco Moser. German Voigt set a new one-hour record of 51.115km on 18 September 2014 . Voigt celebrates after breaking the world hour record at the Velodrome Suisse in Grenchen, Switzerland . A time trial and track cycling specialist, Wiggins is however highly likely to smash that mark when he takes to the track in June 2015. 'I want to prepare for it properly,' said Wiggins, the time trial Olympic champion. 'It will give me something to get out of bed for in the winter.' Other time trial greats Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland and German Tony Martin could spice up the event if they joined the competition. Cancellara, a four-time time trial world champion, put his plans to attempt to break the record on hold after the rules changed. 'The hour record has this charming side to it that I like a lot. Now it's going to be different,' he said in May. The previous regulations stated that riders had to use a bike resembling that of Merckx when he set his mark of 49.431km in 1972. Martin, who won the last three editions of the individual time trial at the worlds and is the hot favourite for Wednesday's event in Ponferrada, Spain, said earlier this year he was open to the possibility of trying to break the record.

"By the time Jordan Henderson caught up with all the transfer comings and goings before he went to bed on Monday night, Barclays Premier League clubs had spent more than £800million this summer. Most of that was on overseas signings, adding to the glamour of the Premier League and damaging the future of the national team by reducing the chances for young English players. Henderson  recognises that the appeal of the Premier League and the phenomenal salaries on offer are major dangers to our national team. Facing the media: Jordan Henderson speaks to assembled press ahead of England's friendly on Wednesday . Three Lions: Danny Welbeck, Wayne Rooney and Jack Wilshere at England's London Colney base on Monday . ‘Obviously the Premier League is a great league and players want to come and play in it — that’s a big part of it,’ said the England midfielder. ‘If they do well against England, they might feel as though they can come and get an opportunity to play in England. ‘It’s one of the best leagues in the world, so that’s a part of it.’ Last weekend the Big Five — Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea — fielded 11 English players between them. Two of those, John Terry and Steven Gerrard, are no longer available for international duty. Henderson is a deep thinker, a decent guy who accepts that Roy Hodgson’s squad failed the country when they returned home from the World Cup without a win. At England’s hotel on Monday, he nominated Gerrard and Wayne Rooney as two players from that failed mission who could have got into Germany’s triumphant squad. ‘Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney are world-class players,’ he said. ‘We also have a lot of young players who could get to that level, such as Raheem Sterling. With the right mentality and the right coaching, they could get there. ‘Germany won the World Cup, so they are operating on a very high level and a level we want to get to. They did very well at the World Cup. They had a bit of luck at times, which you need. They are a good unit, they are defensively solid and great going forward.’ Centre of attention: Henderson in action against Tottenham during Liverpool's 3-0 victory on Sunday . Battle: Former Sunderland star Henderson has become an integral part of Liverpool and England's midfield . Indeed, it will be difficult for any team to match a side comprising Toni Kroos, Manuel Neuer, Mats Hummels, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Mesut Ozil and Thomas Muller. And the truth is that no-one fears this England team, not even Wednesday’s opponents Norway. Hodgson’s squad are fragile. They need to stare out the opposition in the tunnel and make sure they know they will be in a game when they take on England. Instead of instilling fear in their opponents, England are frightened. ‘Playing for Liverpool and England is totally different,’ Henderson admitted. ‘People have to fear England and not want to play us. The only way to do that is to play at a higher tempo and win games. On the ball: Steven Gerrard and John Terry (right) were among the 11 Englishman to feature for the 'Big Five' ‘At Liverpool, the philosophy under Brendan got driven into the players and we have improved all the time. He got his messages across well. Hopefully we can carry on and progress as individuals and bring that to England as best we can.’ Rodgers’ ability to get the best from his team was clear on Sunday, when Henderson played with control and composure in the centre of Liverpool’s midfield alongside Joe Allen and former England captain Gerrard. Henderson is a maturing voice around the England camp and he knows the stakes have been raised after the FA admitted they only expect around 40,000 fans at Wembley on Wednesday evening. People don’t trust this team, the manager or the FA and Henderson is sharp enough to accept that is the price to pay for a shocking World Cup. New kids on the block: Jack Colback arrives at England training with Fabian Delph (left) and Danny Rose . ‘We have to go out there and show we deserve to be in the England team, show how much we care and show how good we are,’ added Henderson. ‘There’s going to be 40-odd thousand there, which is low for Wembley but still a good turn-out to watch a game. ‘I don’t think it will affect us too much and hopefully they can support us as much as possible and we can show them how much it matters to us and make them want to go to the games. ‘We are expected to do well but whoever says that players don’t care about putting on an England shirt is talking nonsense. Training: Andros Townsend and Rickie Lambert in action as England prepare to face Norway later this week . ‘Every player with this squad definitely cares. If you had been in the dressing room after the Uruguay game, you would see how much we care as players.’ The tear-stained shirts are all well and good, but what the nation demands is some evidence that England can one day go deep into tournaments. They are a million miles away at the moment. Henderson knows that, but in the absence of Gerrard and Frank Lampard, he will take on more responsibility. He is a first-choice player now. ‘When you play for England there is always going to be pressure, that is normal,’ he added. Against Norway, it must be the start of a whole new era. End of an era: Frank Lampard, on loan at Manchester City, announced his international retirement last month .","Liverpool midfielder understands that the appeal of Premier League and mega wages on offer are dangers to the England team .

"David Haigh, the former Leeds United managing director who has now spent 130 days in a Dubai jail cell, has issued an explosive statement protesting his innocence while revealing no criminal charges have yet been brought against him. Haigh has been accused by his former employers and former Leeds owners GFH Capital of falsifying invoices and diverting money into accounts controlled by him. The figures that have been reported amount to around £4million. But Haigh, who is still waiting to even be questioned by the authorities in Dubai despite having shared a cell with two or three other prisoners at the Bur Dubai Police Station Jail since May 18, has enlisted the services of forensic investigators at Price Waterhouse Coopers in a bid to clear his name. David Haigh (centre) has issued an explosive statement protesting his innocence . Haigh, who is still waiting to be questioned by the authorities, was the frontman and deputy CEO of Dubai-based bankers GFH when they bought Leeds from Ken Bates in December 2012. He then became managing director of the football club and introduced current owner Massimo Cellino to GFH. Once the takeover had occurred the controversial Italian dispensed with the services of Haigh, who had resigned from GFH and as managing director of the club. In May GFH released a statement confirming 36-year-old Haigh had been arrested ‘on suspicion of fraud, embezzlement and money-laundering while he was employed at the bank.’ Since then a High Court Judge has imposed an interim asset freezing order on Haigh, with Mr Justice Males pointing to the fact that Haigh was facing allegations of ‘false invoice fraud’ in criminal and civil proceedings in Dubai. The Judge said he was satisfied that GFH had a ‘good arguable case’ and said there was evidence of a ‘risk of a dissipation of assets’. But Haigh claims he is the victim and in a detailed statement issued through his representatives on Thursday he said: ‘I have now been held in jail for 130 days during which time no criminal charges have been brought against me. Nor have I been questioned or examined in any way about any criminal matters. ‘Under the cynical guise of what I believe is essentially a vindictive commercial dispute, my former employers Gulf Finance House GFH Capital (GFH) through their lawyers, Gibson Dunn, have publicly accused me of illegally and deliberately diverting money to bank accounts they claim I controlled. Haigh has spent 130 days in a Dubai jail cell and is still waiting to be questioned by the authorities . ‘GFH bases most of its allegations against me on a report commissioned by them from a Gulf-based accountant called Sajjad Haider. I have instructed internationally renowned accountancy and forensic investigators from Price Waterhouse Coopers to examine what purport to be the findings of that report. ‘PWC’s conclusions which I have now received are unequivocal. They say the Haider report on which the GFH allegations are based provides no evidence that I either created false invoices or diverted GFH money into accounts controlled by me. ‘The PWC conclusions also specifically state that there is no evidence provided to support any allegation “that Mr Haigh created fake invoices to illegally divert funds for his own personal benefit from client/escrow accounts held on behalf of GFH by Gibson Dunn”. ‘Both the handwriting report and the PWC findings confirm my belief that vindictive and personal attacks have been mounted against me in order to secure my incarceration in Dubai. Indeed, it has already been admitted in court by GFH that they used subterfuge to lure me to Dubai from the UK. ‘While I do not blame the Dubai system or its authorities for what has happened, GFH knew full well that they had no grounds to have me detained in the UK. I have to remain confident that the Dubai judicial system, which I believe to be fair and just, will do a thorough job which will result in my name being cleared. ‘In the meantime however I believe that GFH are exploiting the Dubai system in having me locked up for more than four months without trial, never having been questioned about any criminality and guilty of no wrongdoing. Justice will prevail; of that I am confident.’ Haigh (right) has enlisted the services of forensic investigators in a bid to clear his name . Haigh said he is now in danger of losing his home. ‘The freezing by GFH and Gibson Dunn of my bank accounts and assets has prevented me from spending even a penny on my living expenses, such as food or medicine,’ he said. ‘The GFH actions are also calculated to cause me maximum problems in Dubai where debt is a criminal offence. In a few days my house may be foreclosed of which GFH are well aware. ‘I can only speculate as to motives for this conduct which, in taking away my freedom and seeking to destroy my reputation and character, is clearly in breach of my fundamental human rights. ‘Can it be coincidence that the amounts of money GFH falsely claim was diverted illegally and deliberately into accounts controlled by me are remarkably similar to the amounts contained in my outstanding claims against GFH? ‘These include payments long overdue to me for expenses, salary, bonus shares and commission incurred during my time working both for GFH and as Managing Director of Leeds United. ‘I have also volunteered to be transferred to a jail for long term serious drug offenders in order to have greater access to my lawyers. This is in spite of the serious and persistent health problems brought on by my imprisonment and the heavy medication which they have necessitated. ‘Despite all this, GFH has shown no interest in engaging on these matters. They appear to me to be motivated by a strategy of seeking to discredit me by keeping me in jail without charge for as long as possible so that I cannot defend myself. 'At the same time they seek to gain maximum advantage from the fact I am unable properly to defend myself through my inability to access my phone, bank and computer records and files. This attempt to make me a scapegoat is cynical and wrong.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","David Haigh has spent 130 days in a Dubai jail cell and is still waiting to be questioned by the authorities .

"It is 10 years to the day since Wayne Rooney, an 18-year-old tyro with the world at his feet, made his unforgettable debut for Manchester United in a Champions League fixture with Fenerbahce at Old Trafford. Many believed the £25.6m transfer fee would weigh heavily on Rooney's young but stocky shoulders but he confounded the doubters with a stunning hat-trick in a 6-2 win. On the anniversary, we take a look back at how Rooney's debut was reported by Sportsmail at the time. Wayne Rooney's scored a debut hat-trick for Manchester United in a Champions League match with Fenerbahce a decade ago as he announced his arrival at Old Trafford in remarkable fashion . MANCHESTER UNITED 6 FENERBAHCE 2 . REPORT BY MATT LAWTON AT OLD TRAFFORD . The shirt he wore at the end belonged to Fenerbahce but the fans who applauded on an enchanted European evening had already identified a legend in Manchester United red. Wayne Rooney had arrived, and in some style. Old Trafford witnessed something magical last night, an opening performance as memorable as any ever seen at their Theatre of Dreams. Not even Sir Bobby Charlton enjoyed a debut like this. Two goals had marked his first league match as an 18-year-old against, well, Charlton. Rooney went one better. He scored three. Rooney drills the ball home from outside the box for his second goal of the evening after 28 minutes . Rooney curled home a free-kick to complete his treble as Gary Neville, Ryan Giggs and Gabriel Heinze looked on . The United fans rejoiced at Old Trafford as their £25m signing made a stylish debut . Tuesday September 28, 2004 . Champions League - Old Trafford . Manchester United (4-4-2): Carroll; G Neville, Ferdinand, Silvestre, Heinze (P Neville 82); Bellion, Djemba-Djemba, Kleberson, Giggs (Fletcher 62); Rooney, Van Nistelrooy (Miller 82) Scorers: Giggs 7; Rooney 17, 28, 54; Van Nistelrooy 78; Bellion 81 . Booked: Heinze . Fenerbahce (4-4-1-1): Rustu; Baris, Luciano, Ozat, Akyel (Akin 62); Balci, Aurelio, Nobre, Sanli; De Souza; Van Hooijdonk . Scorers: Nobre 47, Sanli 60 . Booked: Aurelio . Man of the match: Wayne Rooney. Referee: Frank de Bleeckere (Belgium) Attendance: 67,128 . The matchday programme . Sir Alex Ferguson has dared to compare Rooney to Eric Cantona but already that does not do him justice. Cantona never excelled like this in the Champions League. This was Best against Benfica, Charlton at Wembley. When Cantona joined from Leeds, he started as a substitute against Manchester City. United were pleading poverty on the eve of this contest but they are richer for the £30million they agreed to pay Everton last month. They have Rooney, as exciting a player Ferguson has seen in 30 years - and United have seen in 40. Roy Keane said he was the only English player he would pay to watch and for the 67,000 fortunate enough to be here, Rooney was certainly worth the admission fee. He did more than entertain them with his first professional hat-trick. He took them back to a glorious past and opened the door to a glittering future, leaving them spellbound in the process. Three months out with a broken foot did nothing to lessen his impact. Nor did the side Ferguson selected to play alongside him. David Bellion, Eric Djemba-Djemba and Kleberson occupied three of the four midfield places. Imagine what Rooney can achieve when he finally gets to line up with the real United. Against Fenerbahce he was magnificent, providing a dazzling demonstration of pace, power, poise and precision. As a passer and a predator, he was simply sensational. All three goals came from outside the penalty area. Incredible. Ruud van Nistelrooy provided the ammunition for his opening 17th-minute goal but after that Rooney delivered on his own. A 22-yard shot increased United's advantage. A 20-yard freekick then followed. Who needs David Beckham? Not United. Rooney even mimicked the England captain with a celebration that saw him run to the corner flag with his arms outstretched. No wonder Ferguson said this a footballer who does not require coaching. He needs nurturing, yes. Protecting, certainly. But this is the boy, as Best said last week, who has 'everything'. Manchester United line up before the match - (back row, left to right) David Bellion, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Roy Carroll, Rio Ferdinand, Eric Djemba-Djemba, Mikael Silvestre, Gabriel Heinze; (front row, left to right) Kleberson, Wayne Rooney, Gary Neville, Ryan Giggs . Rooney, wearing a Fenerbahce shirt, asks referee Frank de Bleeckere for the match ball . Minutes played: 90 . Goals: 3 . Shots on target: 4 . Shots off target: 2 . Assists: 1 . Passes: 23 . Passing accuracy: 61 per cent . Fouls conceded: 2 . Fouls won: 3 . Sven Goran Eriksson had seen this before, and against Turkish opposition. He handed Rooney his full competitive debut in last year's European Championship qualifier and the teenager responded with the game of his life. The game of his life, that is, until he met France, Croatia and then Fenerbahce. While Eriksson would have delighted in seeing Gary Neville return to action and Rio Ferdinand take the captain's armband, Rooney wasted little time in proving himself ready for next month's World Cup encounters against Wales and Azerbaijan-But then Rooney, it seems, is always ready. United opened the scoring when Brazilian World Cupwinner Kleberson sent an accurate cross to Ryan Giggs and the Welshman headed past Rustu with considerable aplomb. Already Rooney was sparkling - twisting, turning and running in a fashion defenders fear most. Van Nistelrooy cut through Fenerbahce's back line with a beautifully timed pass, and then looked on in admiration as Rooney struck from just outside the area. Rooney jumps on Ruud van Nistelrooy after the Dutchman scored United's fifth goal of the night . Rooney sends the ball beyond Fenerbahce goalkeeper Rustu for his first goal of the evening . United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said afterwards: 'I don't suppose I have seen a debut like it. 'What you saw tonight is the reason why we signed him. And I think he can only get stronger now. We think the boy has great potential and it was a great performance and a great start by him.' Fenerbahce coach Christoph Daum was equally as enthusiastic, saying: 'Maybe he will become the player of the century.' His second goal arrived in the 28th minute, and it was another trademark strike from a prodigious talent. A sidestep to escape the attention of Umit Ozan, the Fenerbahce captain, was followed by a blistering 22-yard drive. 'Rooney, Rooney, Rooney,' cried the fans. Those who once hailed Denis Law as the King now have their Prince. Fenerbahce reduced the deficit when Marcio Nobre met a 47th-minute corner with a volley, but Rooney's free - kick arrived seven minutes later and again Old Trafford rose to its feet. There was a moment when he stumbled from the sublime to the ridiculous, a backpass that looked more like a shot resulting in a corner for Fenerbahce and another goal for the Turkish champions from Tuncay Sanli. But Van Nistelrooy scored in the 78th minute with an excellent finish, and Bellion left Rustu beaten for a sixth time after running on to a pass from - who else? Rooney. Remarkable. The goals made Rooney the youngest player to score a hat-trick in the Champions League at 18 years and 335 days. He scored 17 goals in 43 appearances for United during his debut season but it was a campaign of disappointment for Sir Alex Ferguson's team. They finished a massive 18 points behind champions Chelsea in the Premier League, ending up in third place, and were eliminated by AC Milan in the last 16 of the Champions League. The rest of Rooney's career at Old Trafford is, of course, pretty impressive. He now has 218 goals in 443 matches for the club and has won six Premier League titles, three League Cups, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup.

"FIFA have left themselves open to further accusations of corruption after insisting their £6million report into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups would not be published. Football Association officials will await an official explanation from the world governing body before issuing a response. But Hans Joachim-Eckert, who chairs the adjudicatory chamber of Fifa’s ethics committee, has reportedly said he would not be allowing the findings of a 350-page report - compiled from 200,000 pages of evidence by New York attorney Michael Garcia – to ever be available to the public. Michael Garcia (left) is said to be furious that Hans Joachim-Eckert (right) will not release the report . Eckert says not even the FIFA executive committee will be able to read the full report when it is finished . Joachim-Eckert, a judge in Munich, has told the Sunday Times that he and his deputy would be the only people to read the report and said that Fifa’s rules prohibited him from even showing it to Fifa president Sepp Blatter and the world governing body’s 27-man executive. It means the accusations of bribery in the bidding process for the World Cup will remain unanswered; at least publicly. It is something that is understood to have infuriated Garcia and John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons culture, media and sport committee, told the Sunday Times: ‘I’m absolutely horrified. Sepp Blatter is at the centre of the curruption scandal which saw the 2022 World Cup awarded to Qatar . 'The one thing we’ve always been told by Fifa is that there would be a proper investigation and we should wait for the Garcia report. 'But if the Garcia report is going to be buried so that we have no idea what the conclusions are, it will leave the reputation of Fifa in pieces. 'It confirms what we have long suspected, that all Fifa is interested in is burying this whole matter and sweeping the evidence under the carpet.’ Lord Triesman poses with Blatter while he was FA chairman. He said the announcement was 'not surprising' Lord Triesman, the former FA chairman who initially led the England bid to host the 2018 World Cup until his resignation seven months before the vote, said: ‘Fifa has a very long-standing culture of misbehaviour and complete secrecy — omerta is the word that comes to my mind — so in a way it’s not surprising that they won’t reveal the contents of the Garcia report. 'But the most clear test of whether Fifa ever attempts to reform is whether it conducts investigations in a transparent way, publishes the details of the findings and deals with the problems in an equally transparent way. 'Other than that, the culture will simply go on as it has done now for decades.’ Lord Triesman suggested that 'the culture will simply go on as it has done now for decades'","FIFA official Hans Joachim-Eckert says the 350-page report will never be available publicly .

"Rio Ferdinand has torn into John Terry for the racism storm that resulted in Ferdinand’s mother receiving death threats and bullets in the post. Ferdinand has branded Terry ‘the biggest idiot’ for sparking the controversy at Loftus Road on October 23, 2011, when the Chelsea captain called Ferdinand’s younger brother Anton a ‘f***ing black c***’. While Terry was acquitted in a criminal trial, an independent FA tribunal found him guilty of racially abusing Anton and punished him with a four-game ban and £220,000 fine.

He also writes how the controversy took a huge toll on his family. ‘My brother Anton, the innocent party in all this, had his career damaged and was subjected to death threats,’ writes Ferdinand in #2sides, which is being serialised in The Sun. ‘There were bullets in the post, and unending racist abuse. ‘My mum had her windows smashed and bullets put through her door, and ended up in hospital with a virus because of the stress.’ Rio Ferdinand says he no longer speaks to his former England team-mate John Terry .

Ferdinand believes the storm ‘wrecked’ his England career because he remains convinced Hodgson made a straight choice between him and Terry for Euro 2012. Hodgson denied it, insisting it was for ‘footballing reasons’ that Ferdinand was omitted from a squad that included Terry. But Ferdinand complains ‘no one ever asked’ if he was prepared to play with Terry despite the criminal trial that was due to follow the tournament.

"Rio Ferdinand has broken his silence on the racism row involving John Terry and his brother Anton, branding the former England captain the ‘biggest idiot’ and accusing both Terry and Ashley Cole of ‘betrayal’. In an explosive new autobiography, Ferdinand reflects on the drama that was sparked by events at Loftus Road on October 23, 2011, when Terry branded his younger brother a ‘f***ing black c***’. While Terry was acquitted in a criminal trial, an independent Football Association tribunal found the Chelsea skipper guilty of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand and punished him with a four-match ban and a fine of £220,000. Rio Ferdinand (left) branded former England team-mate John Terry (right) 'the biggest idiot' in his new book . The FA ruled that Anton Ferdinand (left) was called a 'f****** black c***' by John Terry (centre) in October 2011 . They started together 50 times for England, they were great friends and Rio Ferdinand was among the guests for Ashley Cole’s stag party. But when Cole agreed to give evidence that supported John Terry at his race trial, Ferdinand accused him of ‘betrayal’. In a furious text exchange - an abridged version is repeated below - Ferdinand told Cole that their friendship would be over. Ferdinand later called Cole a ‘fake’ on Twitter. He had previously retweeted a comment that Cole was a ‘choc-ice’. The term usually implies someone is being black on the outside and white on the inside, although Ferdinand denied this and was cleared of a racist comment. He was, however, found guilty of improper conduct by the FA, who said: ‘The commission found that the breach included a reference to ethnic origin, colour or race.’ Ferdinand: ‘Either tell the court exactly what happened, or don’t go at all.’ Cole: ‘I’ve got no choice. I’ve been told I’ve got to go.’ Ferdinand: ‘Know this, we (my family) will never talk to you again.’ Cole: ‘You think I want to come off my holidays and go through this s***? It’s what I’ve been told to do.’ Ferdinand: ‘All right, do it.’ As Ferdinand reveals in his book, #2sides, being serialised in The Sun, the whole episode took a huge toll on his family. They were racially abused and received death threats in the form of bullets sent through the post, while his mother had to endure having the windows at her home smashed and became so ill because of the stress she had to be admitted to hospital. Ferdinand writes of a controversy that ‘damaged football and race relations in Britain’ and for the most part he blames a player he stood alongside in central defence ‘30 or 40’ times for England. In the same memoirs, Ferdinand reveals he would have agreed to continue to play alongside Terry in the England team had manager Roy Hodgson taken the time to ask him. Ferdinand said Terry was ‘the biggest idiot’ who ‘could have saved everyone a lot of pain by admitting immediately that he has used the words in the heat of the moment’. After choosing not to appeal against the FA punishment, Terry did issue a public apology for the language he used. What he has never done, Ferdinand claims, is have the decency to apologise to Anton Ferdinand or his family. Rio Ferdinand, Ashley Cole and John Terry were all teammates for England for a number of years . John Terry (right) could have resolved the issue by ringing the Ferdinand family after the incident, says Rio . Had Terry apologised at the time and insisted he was ‘no racist’, Ferdinand says he and his brother would have let the matter rest. ‘I’d have told him: “I think you’re a p***k for saying it, but you’ve actually come and manned up”.’ But he now says he will no longer speak to someone he once considered a friend, insisting: ‘I find it impossible to forgive or forget the pain he put my family through. ‘He just sat there and watched as my brother went through all that because of his stupidity. That was the betrayal. He tried to run away from what he had done.’ Ferdinand remains resentful of the way the situation was handled by Hodgson when he succeeded Fabio Capello as England manager shortly before the 2012 Euros. But his book underlines how fractured a once superb England defence became because of the Terry race storm. Hodgson should have taken Ferdinand to Poland and Ukraine – certainly ahead of Martin Kelly, who was called up as a replacement for the injured Gary Cahill – but the friction between Ferdinand, Terry and Cole could have become a problem. John Terry quit England after FA’s charge, despite being cleared in Westminister Magistrates of racial abuse . Anton Ferdinand (right) leaves Westminster Magistrates Court after the John Terry racism case in July 2012 . At the time Hodgson insisted Ferdinand was omitted from the squad for ‘footballing reasons’, but the promotion of Kelly – a Liverpool player who had made just 10 Premier League appearances – brought fresh focus on that particular statement. Ferdinand questioned the England manager with a tweet, stating: ‘what reasons??????!!!’ Ferdinand reflects now with some frustration on Hodgson’s failure to engage with him over Terry, suggesting the actions of a colleague brought an abrupt and premature end to an international career that should have reached 100 rather than 81 caps. ‘My England career was wrecked,’ said Ferdinand. Had Hodgson asked him about Terry, Ferdinand would have told him he was still ‘happy to play for England alongside him’. He said he would have acted professionally, recognising Terry as a player who could help his team-mates win. And he would have been right. At Euro 2012, Terry was outstanding. Rio Ferdinand wishes he had been able to reach 100 caps for England rather than the 81 he achieved . Rio Ferdinand says Roy Hogdson (pictured) had asked him he would have played with John Terry for England . ‘But no one ever asked (if he would still play with Terry),’ complained Ferdinand in his book. ‘I found that pretty extraordinary because I’d let it be known. Roy Hodgson should have at least asked. But that conversation never took place!’ Ferdinand feels he ‘should have had 100 caps’. As it was, his last England appearance was against Switzerland in June 2011. He officially retired from international football in May 2013. It appears to be with some sadness that the Terry race row destroyed his friendship with Cole. But Ferdinand was distressed to discover that Cole planned to give evidence on Terry’s behalf in the criminal trial at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in July 2012. It sparked an extraordinary exchange between the two players, with Ferdinand accusing Cole of an act of ‘betrayal’. The two, Ferdinand recalls, had been friends since childhood and he was staggered to discover from Anton that Cole planned to appear in court for his club-mate Terry. Ashley Cole and Rio Ferdinand fell out during the court case between John Terry and Anton Ferdinand . Rio Ferdinand (pictured) has revealed how the John Terry race row affected his family in his book, #2sides . While he acknowledges the pressure Cole must have been under, Ferdinand feels the then Chelsea full-back should have asked Terry to leave him ‘out of it’ because of the impact it could have on his relationship with Rio and Anton. He also said he would have accepted Cole’s verdict had he contacted him to say Terry was innocent. As it was, he did not hear from Cole either. So he telephoned him and to his astonishment Cole rebuked him for making the call. ‘I said, “Ash, what are you doing? My little brother’s going through hell. I’m out of order ringing you? What world are you living in”?’ Terry was acquitted but the FA, as Ferdinand points out, were extremely critical of Cole in their 63-page judgement report, stating that his evidence had ‘evolved’ over time to assist Terry. Ferdinand’s last contact with Cole came via a text exchange just before Terry’s trial. He implored Cole to ‘tell the exact truth’ or not to go at all. Cole meekly replied that he had no choice but to go. Ferdinand warned Cole that his appearance in court for Terry would mark the end of their friendship. Ashley Cole arrives to attend the trial of his team-mate John Terry at Westminster Magistrates court . Ashley Cole (second right) was asked to defend John Terry (centre) in court during the criminal investigation . In court Cole agreed he was a reluctant witness, admitting he was a ‘close friend’ while acknowledging he has known the Ferdinand family ‘for a long time’. But in his role as a defence witness he also argued: ‘I think we shouldn’t be sitting here.’ In the new book, Ferdinand is also critical of Chelsea for the approach they took. In fairness to the current League leaders, they took disciplinary action against their captain on conclusion of the FA hearing. That, however, did not satisfy Ferdinand. ‘At the time Chelsea seemed to have no thought beyond wanting to keep their captain in action,’ said Ferdinand, who no doubt noted that the FA judgement also criticised the conduct of Chelsea club secretary Dave Barnard. The independent FA commission said it had ‘very real concerns about Mr Barnard’s recollections’. Ferdinand feels Chelsea fans failed to realise it was not his brother who reported Terry to the police but a member of the public. He also felt it important to stress that it was Chelsea’s lawyers who summoned Anton Ferdinand to court. Further to that, he remains frustrated by the FA’s decision to delay their own disciplinary hearing until after Terry’s criminal trial. ‘They passed the buck for almost a year,’ he said.

"Jose Mourinho has declared a desire to keep both Thibaut Courtois and Petr Cech at Chelsea this season even though he accepts he will soon have to make one of them extremely unhappy. The Chelsea manager watched Cech make an impressive return from a serious shoulder injury in a pre-season friendly here against RZ Pellets WAC after young French striker Jeremie Boga cancelled out Silvio De Oliveira’s opener for the hosts. But Cech faces a serious threat to his place for the first time in a decade at Stamford Bridge, with Courtois the favourite to start against Burnley in Chelsea’s Premier League opener on August 18.

"This was, Sergio Garcia conceded, much like being hunted by Tiger, complete with the roars that  provided the first sign of danger.

Defending champion Phil Mickelson felt he missed a good opportunity to move up the leaderboard on day three. Mickelson was among the day's first starters, teeing off at 9am, but failed to take advantage of unexpectedly good conditions. The lefthander fired a 71 to lie 15 shots behind leader Rory McIlroy overnight and said: 'We had beautiful scoring conditions, first group off. If we could have shot seven, eight, nine under par it probably was out there. It was as easy as I've seen the course play. We could have made some noise. 'It could have been a lot lower and I let a lot of shots slide.' Mickelson, who came through the field to win with a final-round 66 at Muirfield last year, opened here with rounds of 74 and 70. Garcia admitted afterwards that playing McIlroy in this kind of form is as daunting as waging war against Woods in his prime; an almost futile exercise however well those in  the chasing pack might be playing. 'I don't think Rory has been as consistent as Tiger was for so many years, but when he's at his best he's right up there,' said Garcia. 'Obviously I heard the roar on 16. I didn't know but I imagined it was an eagle. The only thing you can do is say ""well done"".' For Fowler is proved particularly galling. He was tearing up this course in near perfect conditions, going through the turn in 32  and then birdying 10, 11 and 12  to erase the six-shot advantage McIlroy had taken into the third round. But then came that crushing run of bogies and with it an emphatic McIlroy response. Fowler will nevertheless take encouragement from the fact that the six-shot lead McIlroy now has this afternoon can be closed, because he did it in 12 holes yesterday. He can also draw some comfort in knowing his two professional wins to date were both achieved with McIlroy as runner-up. His first victory, the Wells Fargo Championship two years ago, came after beating McIlroy on the first extra hole of a sudden-death play-off. Add to that the benefit of having been in much the same position in the US Open last month, not to  mention the confidence of having already finished in the top five in both majors this year, and Fowler goes into the final pairing today in decent shape. Feel the force: Rickie Fowler tees off on the 13th hole at Hoylake on Saturday . The advice he gets from Phil Mickleson, someone he referred to affectionately as his golf 'dad', is also sure to come in handy. What better mentor to have than last year's Open champion? 'I've learned a lot from Phil,' said Fowler. 'He's kind of been like, I hate to say it, but like a dad out here. It's been a lot of fun being around him. Not just playing on Tuesday, but having dinner with him and  seeing how he operates on and off the golf course.' Thanks to the work he has been doing this past year with Butch  Harmon – a coach Fowler described as the 'best in the world' – the young American has been  itting his irons superbly and at times he putted beautifully too,  sinking one from around 30 feet on the second hole. Garcia's approach on the eighth was also worthy of mention, even if he will want to  forget the two-and-a-half foot putt he missed on 12. Garcia thinks it a tall order, catching McIlroy. 'If he shoots three under, I have to shoot 10,' he said with a smile. 'So if Rory plays the way he's been playing it's difficult to see anybody catching him. When Rory plays well every course suits him. There's not really a lot of weaknesses in his game.' In the swing: American Rickie Fowler has been hitting his irons superbly . Fowler knows that too, having grown up competing against  McIlroy. They are just a few months apart in age – now both 25 – and are actually good friends as well as neighbours in Jupiter, Florida. They also have a penchant for brightly covered clothing even if McIlroy joked this week that  Fowler's fashion sense – he will once again wear the orange of Olklahoma State University today – was highly questionable. 'We've travelled a bit together between tournaments,' said Fowler. 'We first played against each other at the Walker Cup in 2007 and it's kind of gone from there. So I'm  looking forward to it tomorrow. It's going to be a good time. We're good buddies and at the same time we both want to beat up on each other as bad as possible. 'If I can go out and put a bit of pressure on him and make him earn it a bit, get myself in the mix, maybe we'll be able to throw some blows back and forth. 'The US Open last month was my first time in the final group at a major. But it was just a matter of time before the two of us found a way to sneak into a final group together.'","American draws inspiration from fellow countryman in Open bid .

"One is a luxury shirtmaker, while the other specialises in racy lingerie. But these two seemingly polar opposite brands ended up locked in a legal battle – over the name ‘pink’. High-end Thomas Pink, named after an 18th century tailor, took US underwear brand Victoria’s Secret to court after the latter brought out a range called PINK, which it described as being aimed at the ‘college girl’. Luxury shirtmaker Thomas Pink has won a court case against  Victoria's Secret, barring the lingerie retailer from using the word 'pink' on its shop fronts and clothing labels . The London shirtmaker claimed this was confusing customers and that its brand, known for quality and tradition, could be ‘tarnished’ by association, while the underwear shop argued that the two target very different markets. But at the High Court yesterday, Mr Justice Birss ruled in favour of Thomas Pink, saying its luxurious reputation could be risked by Victoria’s Secret’s ‘sexy, mass market appeal’. Thomas Pink Ltd, which began trading in London in 1984, was named after an 18th century London tailor who designed the iconic hunting coat. It launched proceedings after Victoria's Secret opened outlets in the UK in 2012 branded as Victoria's Secret and PINK, contending that it had entered the territorial zone of Thomas Pink's exclusivity and was using PINK as a primary sign on its garments and stores. It said it was obvious that the average consumer was likely to be confused,  and that some had already tried to return lingerie to the defendant's stores, or asked to buy Victoria's Secret goods in Thomas Pink stores. Thomas Pink's lawsuit noted that this was likely to become the norm as Victoria's Secret became more well known in the UK in shopping areas close to Thomas Pink stores. The company also argued there was a real risk of its brand being tarnished as it was known for quality and tradition while Victoria's Secret's message was sexy. Victoria's Secret argued that it was a legitimate retailer and refuted the claim that there was something inappropriate or improper about its trading. It accepted that the two businesses were both related to clothing in general terms but said they were at opposite ends of the spectrum with Thomas Pink having older professional customers. In it's claim, Thomas Pin argued that its exclusive brand would be 'tarnished' if it became associated with the 'sexy, mass-market appeal' of Victoria's Secret . It said that the Victoria's Secret brand was a famous one and when customers encountered PINK, it was always firmly in the context of that famous name, which ruled out any conceivable possibility of confusion. But, at London's High Court today, Mr Justice Birss ruled that Victoria's Secret's use of PINK both on its goods and as the name of its stores was an infringement of Thomas Pink's trade mark rights. He said that the use of PINK emblazoned on the defendant's items of clothing gave rise to a likelihood of confusion as did its shop faces. The fact that some PINK stores were beside a Victoria's Secret store or linked inside did not make any difference, as the average consumer would not normally pay any attention to this. The judge said that Victoria's Secret's use of PINK would cause a detriment to the repute of Thomas Pink's mark, although noted that the term 'tarnishment' was perhaps too harsh. The judge said: 'The defendant's overall business is a legitimate one. Nevertheless, it is one which had been associated with some controversy, no doubt because ""sexy sells"". 'Examples were in the evidence of goods which had to be withdrawn by the defendant after complaints. The defendant's business aims to have a sexy, mass market appeal. 'The link between the CTM (Community trade mark) and the defendant's PINK brand will cause consumers to associate the two. 'The claimant's trade mark will be associated with a mass market offering, reducing its luxurious reputation. '""There is every risk that this will lead consumers not to buy products from the claimant when they otherwise would have done.' Later, Jonathan Heilbron, president and chief executive officer at Thomas Pink said: 'We are delighted with the outcome of this case, and will continue to protect the considerable investment that has been made into building Thomas Pink into a leading luxury clothing brand.'","Thomas Pink has won case stopping Victoria's Secret from using word 'pink'

"Iain Moody was excited on Wednesday afternoon, and understandably so. Crystal Palace’s sporting director believed he was about to be reunited with his old friend Malky Mackay. Moody had followed Mackay from Watford to Cardiff, and now Selhurst Park seemed set to offer an opportunity for the two men to work together again, recreating a partnership that had proved successful on the pitch during their tenure in South Wales. But after Palace learned of the evidence of alleged racism, sexism and homophobia that had been passed to the FA by Cardiff’s lawyers, Mackay’s chances of succeeding Tony Pulis disappeared. And by Thursday lunchtime Moody had resigned, with Palace issuing a short, sharp statement. Investigated: Malky Mackay (right) and Iain Moody have been accused of being racist, sexist and homophobic in a series of text messages dating back to their time together at Cardiff City . Matt Lawton's story that shook football . Mackay issued an apology on Thursday night for his part in the text and email exchanges that have shocked football to its core. But the statement seems unlikely to draw a line under the affair. Mackay’s apology, issued by the League Managers Association, prompted an angry response because of the use of the phrase ‘friendly text message banter’. Judging from the noises emanating from the FA on Thursday, the pair seem likely to receive further censure. Football’s governing body failed to act against Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore, who was engulfed by a sexist emails storm earlier this year, and the Kick It Out campaigner and former footballer Paul Elliott, who was damaged by - but never charged over - his use of the n-word in a text. However, it is understood Scudamore and Elliott were considered to have acted in private, while Moody and Mackay’s exchanges went to a much wider audience. Sorry: Mackay issued an apology on Thursday for his part in the text and email exchanges . The fact that the two men are out of work may not exempt them from punishment, either. If it is concluded that a fine and a ban are appropriate, such verdicts could be held in abeyance until one or both return to work. That, of course, could prove a serious problem if the two men end up receiving lengthy suspensions. It would be unprecedented in football to place a would-be manager or administrator in the position of having a ban hanging over him, even as he is trying to persuade clubs to employ him. The FA investigation is now in full swing and Sportsmail understands there could be further unsavoury evidence in text messages recovered by Cardiff’s lawyers. Until now the information passed to the FA in two letters concerns only the texts detailed in Sportsmail’s exclusive report yesterday. Mackay sent out confused messages on Thursday. In the early evening, his agent told Sky Sports News that he was shocked by the events of the previous 24 hours and intimated that he would fight the allegations. Later in the evening, he issued his apology through the LMA. Confused messages: Mackay's agent told Sky Sports News that the former boss would fight the allegations before the Scot himself issued an apology through the LMA . Others were more forthright and challenged football’s authorities to take a concerted stance against bigotry. The chairman of Kick It Out, Lord Ouseley, called for the ‘appropriate action’ to be taken. ‘These revelations are further confirmation of how football is tainted with racism, sexism, homophobia and anti-Semitism, and the culture which continues to exist throughout the game and in wider society,’ he said. ‘The reality is that these views are most dangerously held by those people in positions of power, and the football establishment knows and condones it. ‘What you see at face value is not always reflective of the attitudes which are actually held deep down. It’s easy to present yourself as being reasonable and fair, and to behave in ways that hide prejudice and bias. However, any in-depth analysis of hidden views would be likely to reveal otherwise. That is what makes it difficult to eradicate such prejudices, bigotry and even hatred. Exclusive: Chief Sports Reporter Matt Lawton's story in Thursday's Daily Mail . Revelation: Sportsmail broke the story of Mackay and Moody's text message exchanges . ‘This familiar scenario acts as a challenge to the leadership of football that cannot be shirked again. The governing bodies and the clubs must denounce such attitudes prevalent in the game, and take the appropriate action. ‘If these types of exchanges made privately make it into the public eye, the individuals concerned must accept the full consequences.’ His views were echoed by former professional Jason Roberts, who has written on these pages. ‘The truth is, nothing in the transcripts of the alleged exchanges surprised me,’ he said. ‘In my mind this is how football talks in private, and more importantly, it is how it behaves in public.’ Unsurprised: Former Premier League striker Jason Roberts said he wasn't shocked by the alleged exchange . Phil Smith, the agent who was the subject of anti-Semitism in one of the texts, was deeply offended. ‘To say it’s good to see a Jew suffer, that’s not good,’ he said. Twitter might have made uncomfortable reading for Mackay yesterday. One player who served under him at Cardiff, Ibrahim Farah, responded to the Sportsmail report by posting a number of tweets before then deleting them. He suggested he has experience of the unsavoury side of Mackay, adding: ‘Wish the people at Cardiff City had seen it sooner.’ Farah said: ‘Malky Mackay always use to call me a wee Egyptian and laugh his head off. No one knows what happens behind the scenes in football clubs. At the time when you’re a young pro, no one will listen. So I chose to keep my mouth shut.’ A further tweet said: ‘Oxford away a young Somali boy was at the gates and Malky shouted look it’s Ibby’s brother.’ Fans' favourite: Mackay was hugely popular at Cardiff and there was outrage when he was axed by Vincent Tan . He then claimed Mackay started laughing with his coaching staff and added: ‘I’m not Egyptian. I’m Welsh and my parents are from Somalia’. Farah, a 22-year-old now playing at Carmarthen, was unavailable for further comment yesterday, while Cardiff also refused to comment on his claims. Mackay’s apology was calculated to distance himself from some of the most odious remarks in the text scandal, and to start the rehabilitation of a man who has achieved so much as a footballer and a manager. However, the FA mood music on Thursday night suggested they are ready to tackle the affair head on. It may be a long time before either Mackay or Moody, two men who have become pariahs over the past days, are able to again work in an industry that has offered opportunity and riches to young men regardless of their background. The LMA wish to clarify the position in relation to recent reports and speculation regarding matters alleged to have arisen during Malky Mackay’s time at Cardiff City FC. In the course of a search by the Club in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff during Mr Mackay’s employment at Cardiff, in relation to other matters, it emerged that Malky had, it seems, sent a couple of one line texts that were, with the benefit of hindsight, very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures. These were two text messages sent in private at a time Malky felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter. That said, Malky believes he could and should have conducted himself better on these two isolated occasions. The precise details need to remain private for the time being until any FA process is complete. The LMA does not condone in any way any potential breach of equal opportunities laws but would also point out that out of over 10,000 text messages and 70,000 documents produced over a long period of time it may not be a complete surprise that some inappropriate comments can sometimes be made by employees, like Malky, working under great pressure in highly charged situations. If Malky has caused any offence by these two isolated matters he would, however, wish to sincerely apologise. Malky finds it strange that these matters were only raised with the FA and in the media now, 8 months after his employment ended and the day before he was reported as being offered the opportunity to become manager of Crystal Palace FC. Malky is also very concerned about seriously inaccurate and misleading reports of his alleged involvement in these matters in the media. It has never been alleged that he wrote any homophobic or sexist messages and he has confirmed that he did not do so. Further, there are incorrect and damaging suggestions that he sent a whole host of offensive and unpleasant messages that are simply not true and which give a grossly distorted and unfair view of Malky’s involvement in this matter. Malky looks forward to matters being put straight in due course, following any investigation of this matter. Malky cannot of course comment on the nature of any conduct or communications alleged to have been made by others. Malky has said that he will be fully co-operating with any FA investigation and that he looks forward to putting the record straight thereafter.","Malky Mackay and Iain Moody reported to FA after series of texts .

"There was a moment here on Thursday when Rory McIlroy tossed a ball towards a young fan in the crowd, only to see the hairy hand of a bearded man intercept it. ‘That was for the kid,’ said McIlroy, fixing the guy with his gaze until the ball had been surrendered to the intended recipient. McIlroy was that relaxed during what amounted to a near flawless 66; so in control, he was able to engage with spectators while shooting six birdies and 12 pars with a marvellous demonstration of power and precision to lead the 143rd Open Championship. VIDEO Scroll down for The Open: First Round highlights . Clearing the way: Rory McIlroy leads after the first day at the Open Championship . Kicking up dust: McIlroy plays out of a bunker on the 18th hole on day one at Hoylake . The question now, however, is whether he can remain as composed when he returns to the lush fairways of Hoylake on Friday afternoon, and so break what has become a nasty habit of messing up his second round. ‘Freaky Friday’ was the term being used in McIlroy’s presence at the press conference he gave after storming to the summit of the leaderboard and he was happy to accept that the statistics don’t lie. In this year alone he is 57 under par for first rounds but nine over for second rounds. He even admitted Jack Nicklaus had raised the issue when the two met for lunch near their respective homes in Florida shortly after his second round collapse at Memorial in May. ‘He said: “How the hell can you shoot 63 and then 78?” And then we talked about holding a round together, although not specifically about my previous struggles on Fridays.’ The fact that he was able to smile about such torturous moments — among them the 80 that followed his tournament-leading 63 at St Andrews four years ago — would suggest he is not overly concerned about his ability to remain in contention. At one point he actually listed his previous Friday travails. ‘I had a bad Friday afternoon at Augusta and then just made the cut,’ he said without the slightest hint of paranoia. Top man: McIlroy topped the leaderboard after the first day at sun-drenched Royal Liverpool . Centre of attention: A camera follows McIlroy along the 14th fairway . In control: McIlroy will hope to continue his form into Friday where conditions are expected to worsen . VIDEO The Open: First Round highlights . ‘And then I started off horrifically at Quail Hollow on Friday afternoon. And then did the same thing at Sawgrass. That’s like three tournaments in a row. That’s when I was conscious of it. I was three-over through nine on Friday at Wentworth and then I was able to get it back in form. And then Memorial obviously was the biggest one.’ He laughed when a reporter suggested he could simply ‘pretend it’s still Thursday’. He also admitted he had been advised to resort to rather more radical tactics. ‘Someone has made a suggestion, but I shouldn’t mention what it is or who it was,’ he said. Sensibly, McIlroy said it was more a case of managing expectations. ‘Whenever I go out and play on Thursdays there’s not really many expectations,’ he said. ‘But when you go back out on Friday after a good score, you know what you can do on the golf course. I need to approach the round the same way I did here.’ McIlroy was magnificent on Thursday, even if he probably should have taken birdie at the first before hitting a sublime approach shot at the second to go one under there instead. That second shot, hit to within a foot of the hole from 191 yards out with a six iron, was, he agreed, among his finest. Following behind: Matteo Manassero finished the day one shot behind McIlroy . At a glance: Spectators flocked to watch the action at Hoylake . Not until the fifth hole did the driver appear, but it was worth the wait; a monstrous 353 yards and almost 20 yards further than anyone had so far managed on that particular fairway. It made getting a birdie on the par five a relatively straightforward exercise for the two-time major winner and was quickly followed by a 12-foot putt on the par three sixth to take him to three under. The fourth birdie would come at the 10th and not until the 11th would he even find the deep rough that is proving so problematic for some here. A poor second shot left McIlroy chipping from the long stuff but the response was majestic, his ball rolling to within two feet of the pin. A hole later, completed with a 10-foot putt for birdie number five, and he was in the outright lead. By getting down in two from sand on the 16th he secured his sixth birdie. At times he was as daring as his royal blue trousers; at others mature beyond his 25 years. In the end it was probably the positioning of his tee-shots that separated him from his even younger playing partners, Jordan Spieth and Hideki Matsuyama. ‘Today was just a real solid round of golf,’ he said. ‘My 63 at St Andrews was a better round of golf, but there were similarities in there.’ Now he just needs to make sure comparisons are not being made with that second round at the home of golf.

"Sir Bradley Wiggins completed a difficult year by clinching his first world road title on Wednesday with a stunning performance in the time trial.

Wiggins was confident that the hilly course would suit him more than his main rival, and so it proved. He was more than four seconds down on Martin at the 12km time-check but crushed the German in the latter stages of the race. For Wiggins it proved particularly satisfying given his bitter disappointment with the decision by Sir Dave Brailsford to exclude him from Team Sky at this year’s Tour de France. ‘It’s been an up and down year — obviously I didn’t ride the Tour de France — so I want to dedicate this to my family because they had to put up with me when I was at home in July,’ he said.

I paced it perfectly.’ Wiggins (left, with his new medal) became the first British rider to take world time trial gold since Chris Boardman in the inaugural race in 1994.

"Wales manager Chris Coleman has backed Gareth Bale to make an impact against Cyprus on Monday after firing a blank during Friday's game with Bosnia-Herzegovina. Despite going close with a brilliant strike late on during the 0-0 draw at the Cardiff City Stadium, Bale failed to get on the scoresheet for Wales, but Coleman is confident the Real Madrid man will respond against Cyprus. He said: ‘We say to the lads: you keep a clean sheet and he will have an impact. He will nearly score or he will score in any game. Even if he’s not on the top of his game he will get something.’ Gareth Bale was in buoyant mood as Wales trained at the Cardiff City Stadium on Sunday ahead of their Euro 2016 qualifier . Bale stretches out his arms alongside Joe Ledley and Danny Gabbidon during the training session on Sunday . Bale and his team-mates look in positive mood as they look to build on their goalless draw with Bosnia-Hercegovina . Coleman has admitted Wales are down to the ‘bare bones’ for the visit of the Cypriots on Monday night after Jonny Williams was forced out through an ankle injury. The Crystal Palace midfielder, on loan at Ipswich, performed well in place of Aaron Ramsey against Bosnia but suffered a number of heavy challenges and was wearing strapping around his left lower leg on Sunday. Coleman was already short of options in that part of the pitch, with Ramsey joined on the sidelines by Joe Allen, David Vaughan, Andrew Crofts and Lee Evans. It likely means a promotion to the starting line-up for Hal Robson-Kanu in a Euro 2016 qualifier Wales need to win at the Cardiff City Stadium. ‘Our one loss is Jonny Williams, he’s not going to be available,’ said Coleman. ‘There were two or three heavy challenges on him and he’s paid his price.

"Golf started out as a kind of sanctuary for Erik Compton. A means of escape from the playground bullies who took exception to his change in appearance after the first of two heart transplants. He was 12 at the time and the drugs he needed to stay alive, to accept the heart that had come from a 15-year-old girl killed in a car accident involving a drunk driver, had caused certain side-effects. ‘I gained a lot of weight, my face became really bloated and I grew facial hair that meant my eyebrows met my hairline,’ said this extra-ordinary American professional. Determined look: Erik Compton is looking to win his first major at the British Open this month . ‘I was like “El Gordo” (a well-built TV host in the States) and some of the kids at school did give me a hard time. I’d gone from being this athlete with Scandinavian blond hair to someone who was called “Fatso” for two years.’ In the end, this softly spoken 34-year-old had to change schools. But it was golf that provided him with peace and solitude. ‘Golf was an escape from some of the things I had to deal with, but the people around me were also proud that I was out there doing something,’ he said. After being diagnosed with viral cardiomyopathy at nine and having a transplant three years later, golf was also one of the few outdoor sports his body would permit him to do. Rough time: 34-year-old American Compton has had two heart transplants . It wasn’t easy at first. He would have to get special permission to use a golf cart in competitions because even walking the course was difficult. But he had talent, and as he grew stronger his game improved. But even today, following a second transplant six years ago, Compton has to pace himself carefully. No sooner had he walked off the course here at Hoylake after a very tidy 18 holes with Sir Nick Faldo than his caddie, Victor, was passing him a pill along with his watch and his wallet. ‘It’s my blood pressure tablet,’ he explained. On Monday he started out with the intention of playing just nine practice holes, but the thrill of being invited by Faldo to join him on the course kept him out there for the full 18. Hanging tough: Compton was bullied at school due to his physical appearance from his heart conditions . ‘I have had blood checks, and the results in the last couple of weeks are better than they’ve been in years,’ he said. ‘I rested up before this by having a couple of weeks off so I actually feel great right now.’ Sadly, it’s not always the case, which is what makes Compton’s story, and the fact that he is enjoying a career that enables him to provide for his wife and daughter in Miami, all the more remarkable. ‘If I withdrew from every golf tournament I play in when I’m not feeling well, I wouldn’t finish half of them,’ he said in a recent interview. ‘That’s why I always give it a shot because sometimes I do start to feel better. But it doesn’t always happen that way. Some days it gets worse.’ Some days it gets seriously bad. Before his last transplant he suffered a heart attack, and just about got himself to hospital and called his parents — fearing he might never speak to them again. Here in Hoylake this week the outlook is rather more positive. He talks candidly and courageously about the challenges he will face when his third heart runs out of steam — the first one lasted 16 years — but he would rather focus on playing well in his first Open Championship, and perhaps even securing a spot on the US Ryder Cup team later this year. Eyes on the prize: Compton hopes to play well in his first Open tournament and even gain Ryder Cup selection . ‘Absolutely, that has to be a target,’ he says of breaking into Tom Watson’s team. ‘Just because I came second in the US Open doesn’t mean I’m going to play well here. But I think my game suits this course. 'It will demand that you create some pars but I think I’m good at that. At the same time, though, this is my first Open here and I will learn a lot this week.’ He will learn with the intention of coming back for many years to come. ‘There are a lot of things they can do now, and hopefully in the next 10 or 15 years things would have moved on again in terms of medical science,’ he said. ‘Hopefully, I’ll be healthy enough to benefit from that. And hopefully people, other transplant recipients, will benefit from seeing how I’ve lived my life.’ Big decision: Compton hopes to impress US Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson at the Open . In that sense he is an inspiration — living proof that a heart transplant does not have to stop you from becoming a professional sportsman. ‘I’m not any more special than any other transplant recipient,’ he said. ‘That’s why people have to keep a close eye on me. ‘But if this heart lasts as long as the first one it should definitely allow me to keep playing  competitive golf for as long as I want to. And then after that, well who wants to be old b******s like you guys anyway?! ‘For me, though, it’s about more than that. Realistic: Compton hopes his current heart will enable him to play competitive golf for as long as possible . ‘I was heading to the driving range here when I met a lady who was with her son, who has a heart issue. He must have been three or four years old and I picked him up so that we could have a photo together. ‘They were excited, and for the parents of kids like that I think it’s good. It helps. ‘Look, if anything happens to me I don’t care. I’m dead. But it’s the people you leave behind; those around you who are affected. The parents in particular. They are the ones giving the medication to their kids. It’s very hard on families.’ He only hopes those families take some comfort and encouragement in seeing him play golf this week.

"Stephen Roche is among 12 former winners of the Tour de France who believe Lance Armstrong should have his seven titles reinstated. Dutch newspaper De Telegrapf contacted 23 surviving winners of the Tour and Roche, the Irish winner of the race in 1987, is among those who think it was wrong of the authorities to strip the American of his record seven wins after he was exposed as a doper last year. This week former UCI president Pat McQuaid dared suggest Armstrong – now serving a life ban – had become ‘a victim’ and WADA president Craig Reedie argued that life bans for dopers are ‘not legal’. Erased: Lance Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles after being found guilty for doping . Speaking out: Stephen Roche, winner of the 1987 Tour, believes Armstrong should get to keep his titles . And Armstrong has now found further support from that elite group of Tour champions. ‘Armstrong should stay on that list,’ said Roche. ‘In the 100 year history of the race you can't not have a winner for seven years. Doping has been part of sport, not only for cycling, for decades. Who tells me Jacques Anquetil won clean. Should we take his victories away? Or why does Richard Virenque gets to keep his polka dot jerseys?’ Joop Zoetemelk, the 1980 winner, said: ‘They should never have erased Armstrong from the list. You can't change results ten years later. Of course it's not good what he did but you can't re-write history.’ Road to glory: Armstrong is now serving a life ban following the revelations about his cheating . Beginning of the end: The USADA produced a document with damning evidence against the American . VIDEO Armstrong to be '100 percent' honest . Of the 25 winners who are still alive, Ferdi Kubler and Roger Walkowiak did not respond while seven disagreed with the question, two had no opinion and Eddy Merckx and Alberto Contador declined the invitation to discuss the issue. Among the more recent winners only Andy Schleck and Oscar Pereiro argued that Armstrong should keep his titles. ‘Who remembers who was second place in those races?’ asked Schleck. ‘I wouldn't know myself. You can't have seven races without a winner, so just leave Armstrong on the list.’ Chris Froome certainly felt things should stay as they are. ‘Those seven empty places symbolize an era,’ he said. ‘We should leave it like it is.’ Tour de France director Christian Prudhomme agreed with the 2013 champion. ‘His name will not be on the list again,’ he said. ‘Period.’","Irishman Roche believes Armstrong should have his seven titles reinstated .

"After missing his third cut in as many tournaments in Aberdeen last week, Lee Westwood conceded that his preparation for the 143rd Open Championship was less than ideal. In Hoylake on Wednesday he remained every bit as candid, giving an interview that opened a portal into what at times sounded like a rather troubled mind; at the very least the mind of a 41-year-old golfer wrestling with one or two issues at what appears to be a bit of a crossroads in his career. He spoke with refreshing honesty, not least when it came to responding to recent comments made by Paul McGinley. VIDEO Scroll down to see watch Lee Westwood discuss the 143rd Open Championship . Ready? Lee Westwood concedes his preparation for the 143rd Open Championship has not been ideal . Making a point: Westwood gave an interview to Sportsmail that opened a portal to a somewhat troubled mind . Form: Westwood knows he must show what he's made of to make the cut for the Ryder Cup team . Any tips? Westwod took time out to watch the World Cup and get away from the tense golfing scene . The Ryder Cup captain said the former world No 1 needed to show a bit of ‘form’ to earn selection for Gleneagles, and Westwood thought that fair enough. Indeed, Westwood said he would not want to be considered if he failed to start playing better, for fear of ‘letting down his team-mates’. In Scotland last week, Westwood pointed to a three-week break as a reason for failing to make the cut. After a busy start to the year, he said he had been feeling jaded going into tournaments and required a complete break from the day job. ‘I needed to put the clubs away and not even think about golf,’ he told Sportsmail on Wednesday. ‘So I just spent time with my family. I watched a lot of the World Cup and we had some friends over from England for my wife’s 40th birthday.’ (Westwood lives in Florida). Because he did not hit a single ball during that period he was, by his own admission, ‘rusty’ in Aberdeen. By Wednesday he was pleased to report that he was happier with his swing. But it remains an introspective Westwood who tees off at 2.38pm on Thursday. Happier: Westwood admits he is more pleased with his swing as he pepares to tee off at 2.38pm on Thursday . Concentration: Westwood had a three-week break from all things golf to recover . Every player goes into a major hoping to win but in Ryder Cup year there is an extra incentive. Westwood, however, is applying a touch of realism to his situation and sounds like he would be happy enough just to be striking the ball sweetly again. ‘Listen, I want to show some form,’ he said when reminded of McGinley’s remarks. ‘I’ve got some big events  coming up and I’d still like to qualify for the (Ryder Cup) team. I feel like I can do that if I can get my game in shape. But if I did need a pick I’d want to be playing well.’ What he wouldn’t want is to be selected on reputation alone; on his fine record as a veteran of eight Ryder Cups. ‘No, I wouldn’t want that,’ he said. ‘You don’t want to let down your team-mates by playing poorly. And obviously if you get picked there’s a lot of added pressure to perform. You’ve got to justify your pick.’ Right now Westwood would not appear to know if he is playing well, even if those close to him would suggest he has been feeling more satisfied about his game than he is perhaps letting on. With his son, Sam, for company in practice this week he has actually been attacking the course with the precision and creativity it demands. ‘You just have to be realistic about your game sometimes,’ he said. ‘I’ve been struggling with my swing a little bit recently. In good company: Westwood and his son, Sam, during a practice round prior to the Open start . What do you think, son? Westwood has been attacking the course with precision and creativity . ‘I’ve been trying to make a few changes but obviously it’s hard to compete when it’s like that. I played a lot at the start of the year and I didn’t really give myself enough time off. I was feeling a bit mentally jaded. I’m still motivated. I’m still practising just as hard. 'I want to play. But you’ve got to feel fresh going into the tournaments. And I just wasn’t getting the balance right between working hard and taking time off. ‘That’s why I took three weeks off. I was supposed to play in the middle week in Washington but I decided not to in the end. I needed to work on my game but I also needed a break. It was just a case of which one I needed more.’ It all sounds perfectly reasonable. A sensible decision by a sensible man. But then he says something that suggests he is still wrestling with some fairly major issues. ‘In golf you’ve got to retain that keenness,’ he said. ‘Physically I feel the same as ever. But when you get to a certain age it becomes a balancing act. Do you still want to work hard at your game? ‘You’ve got 21-year-old kids who are dedicating their whole life to their game. When you’ve got a family, a wife and kids, you have to compartmentalise it a lot better. Focus: Westwood says he finds it difficult to dedicate himself to the game with a family to look after . 'I’ve been doing a bit of work with my coach over the last three or four days and I feel like I’ve found something I can take on to the golf course. I saw Ross Mackenzie (his sports psychologist) on Wednesday. That helps. Ross has given me a few pointers to take out there.’ Westwood says he can take encouragement from his performance in last year’s Open, even if it did end in crushing disappointment after going into the final round at Muirfield with a two-stroke lead. ‘I didn’t feel I played that well at Muirfield,’ he said. ‘I putted really well. But I don’t feel like I’ve struck the ball as well as I’d like to for a couple of years now. Certainly not well enough to win tournaments on a consistent basis. ‘And the fact that I’ve still managed to keep winning the odd tournament and play  consistently means the mental attitude going into tournaments is right. I just need to start hitting the ball better.’ Even so, he does appear flatter than a potential winner of this championship perhaps should. ‘I’m not flat,’ he insisted with a flash of defiance. ‘I’m always keen to do well and I go into every major trying to win. I like links golf. I look forward to this time of year. 'And in three out of the last five years I’ve been in the top three. So if I start playing well I expect to be in contention.’ And not just for The Open.

"Fans desperate for pictures with the Tour de France cyclists are creating danger for riders by trying to take 'selfies' as they race past at 37mph. Competitors have warned that spectators could get seriously hurt if they step into the road when they have their backs to the fast-moving peloton. Tejay van Garderen branded the craze ‘a dangerous mix of vanity and stupidity’ and appeared to be complaining on Twitter on Sunday night that he suffered a knee injury after a collision with a spectator. While some spectators (such as this man pictured) made sure there was a clear distance between them and competitors, others were not so careful . While riders have said they appreciate the support, they have said that creeping nearer to the road to get a better shot is endangering both them and fans. The spectator pictured above keeps a safe distance from the riders. ‘Standing in the middle of the road with your back turned while 200 cyclists come at you, just to take a selfie. Think,’ said the American. ‘I love the crowds and thank you for your support. But please give us room. Gonna ice my knee now.’ His views were echoed by Team Sky rider and British Olympic gold medallist, Geraint Thomas. ‘It was dodgy at times,’ he said. ‘The worst thing is when people have got their backs to the peloton taking selfies. ‘Do . that if you want but go sit in a tree. It’s the new pain in the a**e . that’s for sure. People don’t understand how fast we go.’ Sir Dave . Brailsford agreed. ‘British people are fantastic at supporting sport,’ he said. ‘But the riders were worried about safety.’ Support: Millions of fans lined the route as the tour began in Yorkshire but a few caused trouble . Concern: Some of the cyclists are worried at how close the crowds got on the narrow roads . Anywhere will do: Fans climbed walls and some even camped out to get pictures of the race . Britain’s Simon Yates, riding for Australia’s Orica GreenEDGE team, told the New York Post: 'The crowd support in England was amazing. The only real complaint was people taking selfies in the middle of the bunch and having their back to the peloton. 'Everyone is out there having fun and a lot of people don’t realize we’re coming past at 37 mph and we use every inch of the roads.'

"Gareth Southgate has revealed England will make another attempt to convince Aston Villa winger Jack Grealish to switch nationalities from the Republic of Ireland.

The family and Jack are aware of our interest. Up to this point they have preferred to remain with Ireland. ‘I haven't spoken to him personally but certainly people from our organisation have kept in contract. We have been monitoring him but in the end it’s up to the player. ‘He's going to make his decision on where he wants to go. These things are quite fluid at younger ages, it happened with Michael Keane and his brother Will, and Jonathan Bond came from Wales. ‘More and more, because of the nature of society, there are players in our system who are duel nationality and have that choice to make. ‘Lots of other home nations are running development camps at a young age so players develop an allegiance quite young. ‘You are allowed to switch once when you are a young player and Jack is someone we are monitoring and we'll keep our eye on that situation.’ Under 21s manager Gareth Southgate revealed England have been monitoring Grealish over the years .","England keen for Aston Villa winger Jack Grealish to switch nationalties from the Republic of Ireland .

"Arsenal and Liverpool each paid £16million for a striker with something of a point to prove in the closing stages of the transfer window. Danny Welbeck arrived in north London with a reputation for hard work, level temperament, a little skill, pace, power, and questionable finishing. Mario Balotelli landed on Merseyside with a reputation for not much hard work, erratic temperament, a lot of skill, pace, power and cool finishing, at least from the penalty spot. Mario Balotelli had a night to forget for Liverpool while Danny Welbeck scored a hat-trick for Arsenal . But already, with Wednesday night’s Champions League action as Exhibit A, the evidence suggests it is Arsene Wenger with the bargain on his hands, while Brendan Rodgers perhaps has only trouble, greater even than he anticipated. Wenger had the opportunity to buy Balotelli but declined, while Rodgers had earlier in the summer dismissed the idea totally. Circumstances changed and he must now get the best out of the Italian. Welbeck, meanwhile, has quickly shown he could be better than many thought possible. Juxtaposing the abilities of the two players born just three months apart shows why. Welbeck, congratulated by Alexis Sanchez following his goal, looks to have settled in quickly at Arsenal . Balotelli goes to ground on a frustrating evening as Liverpool lost 1-0 to Basle in the Champions League . Work rate . This is the defining quality that separates Welbeck from Balotelli. Too often a backhanded compliment for players not as talented as others, it is actually the difference between winning and losing. Welbeck will run all match for his team, while Balotelli often looks like he’s not overly keen to stride a few yards. At Manchester United, that willingness meant Welbeck would be asked to play on the wing rather than up front. With a finish reminiscent of Arsenal legend Thierry Henry, Welbeck's three strikes gave Arsenal a 4-1 victory . Welbeck worked tirelessly for the Arsenal cause and created countless problems for the Galatasaray backline . It is also why Sir Alex Ferguson gave Welbeck the job of No 10, under instruction to target and tackle Xabi Alonso, when Real Madrid visited Old Trafford in March 2013. Can you imagine Rodgers requesting a similar, thankless task of Balotelli? It would be harder than convincing George Clooney to take a role as a supporting actor in a blockbuster film. Rodgers could not even persuade Balotelli to applaud travelling Liverpool fans following defeat in Basle. Balotelli looks down following a disappointing night for Liverpool in Switzerland . Balotelli failed to register a single touch in the opposition's box as Liverpool failed to score in Switzerland . Finishing . Following Welbeck’s first goal for Arsenal against Aston Villa, Wenger explained his belief that an instinct for finishing had ebbed during years spent on the edge of stage at United. When every shot is scrutinised because of their infrequency, confidence can sap. This is not to absolve Welbeck for misses – indeed his attempted dink when through against Manuel Neuer last season stands out as a particularly galling episode – but it goes some way to contextualising 20 goals in 92 Premier League for United (39 appearances were from the bench). As he showed in his hat-trick against Galatasaray, Welbeck actually possesses the tools to score plenty. His first for United, as a 17-year-old, was a thunderbolt from range, while the 'Welbeck heel' for England against Sweden at Euro 2012 expressed ingenuity. Apprearances - 4 . Minutes on pitch - 310 . Goals - 0 . Mins per goal - n/a . Shots on target - 5 . Shots off target - 8 . Shooting accuracy - 38% . Chance conversion - 0% . Blocked shots - 7 . Goal assists - 0 .

Stats courtesy of Opta . Balotelli has never suffered from a shortage of bravado. Sorting his famous ‘Why always me?’ T-shirt ahead of the Manchester derby shows as much. His finishing has mostly backed that statement up. From 12 yards he is pretty much invincible – recent lapses in Italy failing to puncture his perfect record in England – and there is no doubt he possesses the mentality of a goalscorer. He makes the difficult look simple, as with his only Liverpool goal to date against Ludogorets, and has a knack for finding the extremities between the posts. His record for Manchester City of 20 Premier League goals in 33 starts bears scrutiny with the best. Welbeck prods the ball past Galatasaraay goalkeeper Fernando Muslera to open the scoring for Arsenal . Balotelli shoots at goal but the assistant referee is quick to signal for offside to deny the Liverpool striker . Attitude . A tale of two mindsets. Where Welbeck is the ultimate team player, Balotelli is the ultimate maverick. Moves will often link through Welbeck, who set up Mesut Ozil in the win at Villa Park, and he showed his willingness to run beyond the shoulder of the last defender against Galatasaray. He may want that centre-forward role dearly, but his time at United shows he will not shun an order to sacrifice himself for the greater good. Sacrifice is the word Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher could not countenance when discussing Balotelli. His psychology is attuned to individual glory, as much as he may be a likeable figure in the dressing room. Given the lone forward role in Basle, he regularly dropped deep in search of the ball when he would have been better suited providing an outlet further up. There was not a single touch in the opposition box, but two cracked free-kicks from distance – admittedly very good – and a shot slashed horribly wide when team-mates offered better choices. Welbeck screams with joy as he celebrates scoring the goal which gave him his first ever hat-trick . Balotelli endured a miserable night up front for Liverpool and regularly dropped deep in search of the ball . Flair . This is an area Balotelli should excel over Welbeck but any footballer schooled in United’s academy since the age of 11 will have a sure touch. Welbeck can dribble and perform a drag back as well as anyone in the division. Balotelli holds all the tricks in his locker but utilising them for best impact is a talent he is yet to master. Just remember that Zidane turn when through on goal in a pre-season friendly for City. Roberto Mancini hooked him straight away. Welbeck dribbles past Galatasaray's makeshift centre back Felipe Melo and marauds forward with the ball . Balotelli has plenty of tricks in his locker but the Italian has failed to truly master and utilise his talents . Fans rating . Arsenal supporters were initially uncertain about Welbeck, even if they did delight in capturing a player United’s faithful had called their own. That Spurs were gazumped also added to his allure. But any doubts are beginning to be dispelled and virals celebrating Welbeck have flooded social media, ever the gauge of a footballer’s popularity. Liverpool followers will always want to unite behind their players and even though Balotelli was once a thorn in their side, hundreds of fans flocked to the club’s Melwood training base the night he conducted his medical, cheering as he left past 9pm. That initial excitement has turned into realisation that he is not the Messiah, however, just Mario (and sometimes he can be a very naughty boy). Welbeck has dispelled any doubts Arsenal fans once had while Liverpool supporters may be realising Balotelli is not the Messiah they had been hoping for when the frontman arrived from AC Milan . Competition for places . So far Welbeck has enjoyed the run of the Emirates with Olivier Giroud injured. It will be interesting to witness his reaction, and Wenger’s, when the France striker returns from his foot problem in January. He might have sealed his starting role as centre forward by then if he carries on like he is. Lukas Podolski can play up front but is out of favour, while Theo Walcott is another who wants to play striker but is currently injured. Finally Welbeck is the main man in possession of the shirt. It is a similar situation for Balotelli at current. Daniel Sturridge has been superb since arriving from Chelsea in January 2013 but has a frustrating habit for getting injured. He has been out with a thigh strain since the start of September. Once fit, he could force Balotelli to the bench, with Raheem Sterling and Adam Lallana for support instead. Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini are Rodgers’ other striking options but neither is setting the world alight at Anfield. Lambert hasn’t scored in five substitute appearances in the Premier League, while Borni has managed to stick around despite everyone’s best efforts to get him to Sunderland. He did score 10 times on loan on Wearside last season but only twice for Liverpool the campaign before.","Mario Balotelli and Danny Welbeck both moved for £16million .

"Asmir Begovic has a big, long weekend ahead of him. On Friday night he is tasked with keeping Gareth Bale from finding the net. On Monday, there is Eden Hazard to contend with. Arguably, two of the best five attackers in the world in the space of four days. Good luck with that. The Stoke goalkeeper pulls on his Bosnia jersey to resume their qualifying campaign for Euro 2016 and will line-up in Cardiff to face the world most expensive player for a sixth time in his career. A point of interest: so far, Bale has yet to score. Asmir Begovic has a tough weekend ahead of him, where he will face Wales and then Belgium . Within those games, Begovic (right) will face Gareth Bale and Eden Hazard - two of the best attackers around . Thibaut Courtois has been beaten by Bale, Joe Hart and Petr Cech too. But not Begovic. ‘Hopefully we can keep it that way,’ he says, having been previously unaware. ‘That would be good.’ They have played on opposing teams four times for Tottenham and Stoke, dating back to April 2011 and as recently as May 2013. In February last year, Begovic tweeted that Bale had gone into ‘Beast Mode’ after scoring a brace, including a brilliant late winner, against West Ham at Upton Park. But six months prior to that Begovic kept a clean sheet as Bosnia beat Wales, and Bale, 2-0 in a friendly in Llanelli. Such quirks happen in football and Bale has progressed his talents to a higher level since moving to Real Madrid but it provides a mini-duel to note when their nations collide. ‘I’ve had the joy of playing against him a few times and had a lot of fun doing it,’ says Begovic. ‘I think he is up there now as one of the best players in the world. Make no mistake about it, it will be a huge test for us as a whole team to try and contain him. ‘Wales as a team have grown. They have factors all over the pitch and good players in each position. But obviously Gareth Bale stands out. He is going to be a tough player to mark.’ Since we spoke, Aaron Ramsey and Joe Allen have been forced out through injury, bringing the focus on Bale even greater. Bale (left) has been in great form for Real Madrid, but he is yet to score against Begovic in six attempts . Bale (left), pictured with Crystal Palace midfielder Jonny Williams, has been training with Wales this week . Begovic is speaking at a fundraiser for his self-named charity foundation, which grants money to improve sporting facilities in Stoke and his native Bosnia. It is clearly something he has close to heart, having fled his war-torn homeland with his family aged four. ‘The charity has been set up to build sporting facilities, rebuild current ones,’ he explains. ‘It is mainly to do with encouraging kids to go out, enjoy sport, be active. It affects so many different areas of life that it can do good. It’s in Bosnia and the local Staffordshire area.’ Sport has been Begovic’s spur. Not only is the 27-year-old one of the most consistent goalkeepers in the Premier League, he is also a fan of tennis, basketball, baseball, American football, and hockey, name-dropping Rafael Nadal, LeBron James, and Tom Brady as heroes. That North American link comes from growing up in Edmonton, Canada, having moved across the Atlantic from Germany. He can speak Bosnian, German, English and French (from his time playing in Belgium) as a result. His season to date has been mixed. Two clean sheets against Manchester City and Newcastle, but five goals conceded against Queens Park Rangers and Sunderland. Stoke are yet to fire like they did last season. Begovic played all three of Bosnia's matches at the 2014 World Cup, pictured conceding against Nigeria . Hazard will be a huge threat to Begovic's goal on Monday, when Bosnia play host to Belgium . The same goes for Bosnia, who suffered a shock loss to Cyprus to place extra importance on the Wales match on Friday night. Wales beat Andorra 2-1 thanks to a Bale brace in their first match, while Belgium and Israel complete qualifying Group B. ‘Of course it puts a bit more pressure on the Wales game,’ says Begovic of the 2-1 home defeat to Cyprus. ‘Going forward the group is going to be very competitive, it’s very open, teams will get points off each other. ‘So even though we lost the first game nothing is lost in the big picture. Hopefully if we can get a positive result in Cardiff we can push on from there and get as many points as we need to qualify for the tournament. ‘Whether we go directly or via play-off it doesn’t matter as long as we get there in the end.’ Begovic played all 270 minutes of Bosnia’s World Cup, where they lost narrowly to Argentina and Nigeria before beating Iran 3-1 but failing to make it to the knock-out phase. ‘We got to play against Argentina at the Maracana. It doesn’t get much better than that,’ says Begovic. ‘Just being part of that makes you a better player, a better person. Gives you a sense of achievement. ‘No matter the results we made the most of the whole experience and hopefully we can become a better team going forwards and use it as motivation to be involved in more major tournaments.’ Congratulations to Coventry City Council for alienating not one, but two sets of fans over their vote to sell the Ricoh Arena to Wasps in a £20million deal. Not only are the rugby team’s supporters understandably angry at the prospect of having to trek an extra 82 miles to attend home games, but Coventry’s faithful are also wary at what it might mean for them. London Wasps have agreed a deal to move to the Ricoh Arena, alienating both their fans and Coventry City . Only last month the football team returned to the ground, on an initial two-year basis, after an exile in Northampton but that security is cast in doubt. How will the ground-share work? Will the colours change? What about the pitch? Questions supporters would like answers to. The fractious relationship between the council and Coventry owners Sisu means communication was always likely to be minimal but in this game of financial brinksmanship it is the fans who suffer. It always is. Speaking of which, Hereford Town have been offered an olive branch by local rivals Kidderminster Harriers as the latest chapter in their sorry ownership continues. Kidderminster will allow hundreds of Hereford fans to protest against the running of their club during their Conference match against Welling on Wednesday night, which is broadcast live on BT Sport. Hereford, famous for Ronnie Radford’s rocket, dropped two divisions this summer to the Southern League because of financial irregularities and remain in deep money troubles. Martin Watson, Hereford United Supporters Trust vice-chairman, said: ‘We are going to be singing a few songs, we've got some banners. Basically we're going to make a noise.’","Asmir Begovic is currently on international duty with Bosnia .

Mention of the Keane’s literary effort to Lambert, published two days before Ireland face Gibraltar at the Aviva Stadium, brought a smile to the face of the Aston Villa manager. He offered a simple but revealing review. ‘I’ve seen bits of it,’ he said. ‘And it’ll be… aye… listen, take cover like. It will be good reading put it that way. Great night-time reading.’ Lambert said the club had not needed to vet Keane’s writing, adding, ‘I’m pretty sure it will be alright’, and joked any passages about him would be minimal. ‘He’s got a full stop dedicated to me,’ laughed Lambert.

"Christian Benteke is set to make his comeback from injury against Manchester City with Paul Lambert insisting his striker will not be wrapped in cotton wool once he is out on the pitch. But there has been a setback for fellow centre-forward Libor Kozak, who underwent surgery once more this week on his broken leg and could be out until the new year. Benteke, 23, has not featured since the loss at Manchester United on March 29 after rupturing his Achilles in training five days later but is expected to be named among the substitutes at Villa Park on Saturday. Christian Benteke is in line to make his comeback against Manchester City on Saturday . Christian Beneteke looked sharp during training at Bodymoor Heath on Tuesday . Lambert said he would make the final call on Friday if the Belgium international comes through training, after he had a successful 63 minutes for Villa’s Under-21s side on Monday. But once Benteke is back amongst it, after six months out, the Villa manager wants his star player to perform. ‘We’re not going to wrap him in cotton wool. If he’s out there he’s got to go and do it,’ Lambert said. ‘The main thing for me was his legs, lung-wise, and that lack of games. He will get there. His injury was the most important thing and he’s recovered from that.’ Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke played for the Under 21s on Monday . Kozak meanwhile broke his leg in training in January and had looked on course to return to action at a similar time to his strike partner. But Lambert revealed the Czech Republic international, bought for £7million from Lazio last summer, had needed a further operation this Wednesday on his fracture to insert a supporting pin. Kozak, 25, scored four goals in eight starts for Villa before his injury. ‘I haven’t spoke to the doctor about the length that he will be out but it’s going to be a while,’ said Lambert. Libor Kozak has suffered a setback in his recovery from a broken leg . ‘It’s a nightmare. I spoke to him about his injury and he felt a bit down which is understandable because he’s worked so hard to get back. ‘He wasn’t too far away from being back. He was running and doing everything. It’s a blow for him and blow for us. It’s just not healed the way we thought. ‘When he came his goal ratio was very good. He’s a handful. He’s just been unfortunate that he’s suffered that setback.’","Belgian striker has been sidelined since March due to ruptured Achilles .

"Wolves entered this match with an undefeated record in the league at Molineux all calendar year and with top spot in the Championship in sight. By full-time they had neither, beaten by a team buoyed under the management of Chris Powell and with Grant Holt at his bristling best. Conor Coady scored the goal of the night, a glistening strike from almost 30 yards that curled into the top corner to illustrate why he had been on Liverpool’s books until this summer. Huddersfield Town's Conor Coady curls in a sublime third goal for his side against Wolves . HUddersfield players celebrate as Wolves fans are unmoved while watching their side go down . Wolves 4-4-1-1: Ikeme 6; Ricketts 6.5, Batth 5, Stearman 4.5, Golbourne 5.5; Henry 5.5 (Clarke 75’ 5.5), Evans 6 (Rowe 42’ 6), McDonald 6.5, Sako 5.5; Sagbo 6 (Van La Parra 55’ 5.5); Dicko 7 . Subs not used: McCarey, Edwards, Saville, Ebanks-Landell . Booked: Stearman . Manager: Kenny Jackett 6 . Huddersfield 4-5-1: Smithies 6.5; Smith 6, Hudson 6.5, Lynch 6, Robinson 6; Scannell 7 (Dixon 90’), Hogg 6.5 (Wallace 90’), Coady 7, Butterfield 6.5, Bunn 7; Holt 7.5 (Stead 79’ 5) Subs not used: Murphy, Wells, Billing, Ward . Manager: Chris Powell 7 . But the plaudits should go to Powell, whose treatment at Charlton reflects in even poorer a light given his start at Huddersfield, and Holt, who was a nuisance all night. Powell made a big call to replace Nahki Wells, who scored twice to beat Millwall on Saturday, with Holt, who arrived on loan from Wigan last week. But having studied Wolves’ draw with Reading he believed the 33-year-old’s physical presence would do damage. He was right. Holt created the first goal in the 21st minute, simply proving too strong for Richard Stearman as the pair raced for a bouncing ball down the touchline. One shoulder barge sent the Wolves defender to the floor and enabled Holt to fire a cross that was converted by Harry Bunn. ‘He won’t be wearing the armband, but he’s a leader,’ said Powell of the player who was at Aston Villa last season. ‘I’m quite surprised but happy we were able to get him. He brings intelligence, link-up play, goals, and assists as he showed.’ Harry Bunn claims his opener after benefiting from the strong work of Grant Holt . The loan move runs out on November 8 but don’t be surprised to see Powell extend it. The goal sent Huddersfield on their way to a second win on the bounce to lift them clear of the relegation zone. Not since MK Dons claimed all three points last December had Wolves lost here in the league, having won all four Championship home games this season. But despite shining brightly in periods, Kenny Jackett can only accept the visitors deserved the win for sheer ruthlessness. It extends a hoodoo Huddersfield seem to hold over Wolves, this their seventh consecutive victory in fixtures between the sides. Yannick Sagbo’s capture on loan until January should prove a shrewd piece of business by Jackett. This was his first game since signing from Hull and within 17 seconds he almost produced instant payback, but his shot flew wide. Wolves went closer in the sixth minute, Sam Ricketts cutting in from the right and smacking the post with a left-foot shot from 20 yards. Sean Scannell made it two for Huddersfield with his finish taking a slight deflection off Danny Batth . But Bunn opened the scoring and in the 39th minute hesitant Wolves defending allowed Holt to poke a pass into the box that struck Stearman’s hand. Referee Philip Gibbs could have awarded a penalty but in an instant Sean Scannell ran onto the ball and hit a finish that took a deflection off Danny Batth to beat Ikeme at his near post. After the interval Jacob Butterfield brought a fine save from Ikeme with an effort from distance and then Coady showed his class. Jack Robinson’s cross was headed clear only as far as the 21-year-old, who took one touch and bent a wonderful shot that left Ikeme no chance. Bakary Sako pulled one back, finishing between the legs of Smithies from Dicko’s pass, but it was in vain. ‘I was disappointed with our response to those goals,’ said Jackett. ‘We looked shell-shocked. It knocked us too much. I’m looking for a better reaction.’ Huddersfield is flying under new manager Chris Powell (right) with two wins on the bounce .

"In the two days after a section of West Bromwich Albion fans booed their team from the field following defeat to Everton, Alan Irvine got out of the midlands. Not because this 56-year-old Glaswegian couldn't handle the heat, but rather he had Premier League matches to watch. On the Sunday, he was at Old Trafford as Manchester United’s 'Gaalacticos' illustrated their attacking force while just about hiding their defensive frailties in the 4-0 win over Queens Park Rangers. Alan Irvine punches the air in delight after his West Brom team beat Tottenham 1-0 on Sunday . Irvine celebrates as James Morrison heads his team's winner at White Hart Lane . Morrison heads home the Baggies' winner at Tottenham with 16 minutes remaining . On the Monday, he travelled to the KC Stadium as Abel Hernandez and Enner Valencia announced themselves to English football in a pulsating 2-2 draw between Hull and West Ham. In 48 hours, roughly 400 miles covered as Irvine sought to scout future opponents and get a measure of what his team will face this season. Rather than rely on videos or reports, he wants to witness as much football first-hand as possible. At training, he is first to arrive, typically by 7am, reminiscent of another of Glasgow’s football sons. The sessions are said to be the best many of the players have experienced. That is not to say any of this is particularly unusual for a Premier League manager – or in Irvine’s case, head coach – but the point is this is a talented man working hard enough to be afforded time in a role not without its difficulties. In the summer 13 senior players left, with 11 arriving – a change in personnel greater even than Ronald Koeman has had to manage at Southampton. Knitting the team together was made trickier by the number of new recruits who had missed pre-season and were not yet fit enough to play. Irvine was at Old Trafford on a scouting mission as Man United beat QPR 4-0 a week-and-a-half ago . A day later, Irvine was at the KC Stadium to see Abel Hernandez head home in Hull's 2-2 draw with West Ham . Irvine's work ethic, including being first at the training ground every day, is comparable to Sir Alex Ferguson's . Britt Assombalonga has the opportunity to test his talents against Premier League defenders with Tottenham as Capital One Cup opposition for Nottingham Forest on Wednesday night. he hulking striker has scored eight goals in the Championship already, after being bought for £5.5million from Peterborough. That looked steep, but if he nets at White Hart Lane then the perspective really does flip. The 21-year-old has the potential to play higher. The results were uninspiring – draws with Sunderland and Southampton (although that 0-0 at St Mary’s now looks better in context) and defeats to Swansea and Everton. Heading into their match at Tottenham, West Brom were as long as 7/1 to win. Bottom place in the table beckoned. That they deservedly came away with three points is a credit to Irvine’s training sessions and tactics as much as a signal of further Spurs malaise. That victory was huge. With it, West Brom’s position and Irvine’s credibility took a leap. There was anger from fans when Irvine was announced as next in line after Pepe Mel. Scarred from a season of three managers and flirtation with relegation, they craved a sign that this campaign would be different. Understandably, a bigger name was desired. Better still, someone with Premier League experience. Heck, just an individual who had not been sacked at his last two jobs would do. Irvine replaced Pepe Mel, who left The Hawthorns at the end of last season . Irvine previous worked in David Moyes's coaching staff at both Preston North End and Everton . Irvine was also in charge at Sheffield Wednesday in 2010 & 2011, but couldn't stop them dropping to League 1 . What do Leicester’s Esteban Cambiasso and Aston Villa’s Tom Cleverley have in common? Before any jokes about their respective abilities as midfielders, you should know each sidestepped agents to call their current clubs direct and get their transfers sorted. Occasionally middlemen only end up creating a muddle. But Irvine it was, selected by chairman Jeremy Peace under recommendation from technical director Terry Burton. They looked into the details of Irvine’s chastening experiences at Preston and Sheffield Wednesday and found on each occasion the cord was cut at a very early period of downturn. They listened to figures within the game, who told of Irvine’s ability to improve players on the training fields and create relationships with those under his instruction. Joleon Lescott admires Irvine from their time together at Everton and joined soon after the Scot was unveiled. (He reminded what a good defender he is in that shut-out at White Hart Lane, his first game for six months.) Importantly, Irvine works within West Brom’s continental structure. Tim Sherwood, who priced himself out of the job, wanted two assistants. Clearly one win over Spurs does not dispel all the doubt about Irvine, especially in the eyes of fans, but it means Wednesday night’s Capital One Cup tie against Hull will be played in an upbeat atmosphere. Burnley visit the Hawthorns on Sunday in a match West Brom will want three points from, although with only four goals scored by these teams combined it promises to be a tight encounter. Irvine is likely to stand at the edge of the technical area in club tracksuit once more before changing into suit and tie for media duties. Firm handshakes will greet those searching for such. Then there will be trips across the land, as Irvine endeavours to make this third opportunity at management last longer than his others. He deserves that chance.","Alan Irvine travelled 400 miles on a scouting mission after West Brom's home defeat to Everton and is always first on the training ground .

That tradition of shocks is almost certain to form part of Micky Mellon's team talk when Shrewsbury Town entertain the might of Chelsea next month. Shrewsbury’s annual wage bill is understood to be about £1.4million, more than 125 times smaller than their visitors' – which stands at £176m. Eden Hazard’s new £200,000-a-week contract would see him earn more in two months than the entire squad in Shropshire. James Collins scored the only goal of the night as Shrewsbury dumped Norwich out of the Capital One Cup . Andy Mangan (left, a free transfer) and Collins (a nominal fee from Hibernian) are top scorers on four . The League Two side have earned their night. Shipwrecked Blackpool were dispatched easily back in August before top flight Leicester City couldn't find a way past their lowly visitors in round two. In fact, that is something all three higher ranked sides - Tuesday's scalp Norwich City included - failed to do: score against the Shrews. Jose Mourinho would do well not to take their trip to New Meadow lightly. This is a club on the rise, well set up by Mellon and steely at the back. If they were to pull something else off, it would be comparable to that freezing December night at Valley Parade two years ago, the shootout at Anfield and even more impressive than United's mauling in Milton Keynes a month ago. Mellon was brought in over the summer as Town revamped themselves into a club able to bounce straight back into the third tier following relegation. They've done it very cheaply, too. Top goalscorer James Collins was brought back from Hibernian for a nominal fee in the summer  while Andy Mangan, his partner, cost nothing. Not a bean. The same can be said for Jayson Leutwiler, James Wesolowski, Mickey Demetriou, Cameron Gayle, John-Louis Akpa Akpro, Nat Knight-Percival and Scott Vernon. The list goes on. Seventeen (17) new players. Cesc Fabregas (celebrating at Manchester City on Sunday) cost Chelsea £30million from Barcelona . Diego Costa (scoring against Swansea City earlier this month) was a £32million capture from Atletico Madrid . Micky Mellon has revamped Shrewsbury since taking over as manager in the summer . Jose Mourinho's side beat Bolton Wanders (managed by Dougie Freedman) at Stamford Bridge . Compare that then to Chelsea. £32million on Diego Costa. £30million on Cesc Fabregas. A fair wedge on substitute Loic Remy, too. The total amount splurged by the London club stood at £92.5million. The tie will not be as lucrative as might be thought, there is no prize money, but a £125,000 cheque for what should be a live television game will be gratefully received by a club who lost their League One status last season. ‘Hopefully we can give a good account of ourselves on and off the field and people will come back and see us more often,’ chief executive Matt Williams told Sportsmail. ‘With my business head on I’d have preferred to be away at Stamford Bridge with 40,000 people. But from the point of view of the chairman, supporters and players we’re absolutely delighted it’s at Greenhous Meadow.’ Almost 10,000 supporters will be crammed into Shrewsbury's small New Meadow ground . These sides are worlds apart, and the competition pits them level. It does not matter that the Blues have lifted the trophy four times before or that Shrewsbury's greatest achievement was reaching the semi-final in 1961. They've never played in the first division and the only silverware won comes from topping the third tier (1979) and fourth (1994). There isn't even a Johnstone's Paint trophy in the cabinet. A trip to League Two opposition for Chelsea may provoke thoughts of agricultural football and a pitch to match – but Shrewsbury provide pristine conditions and a positive style of play. ‘The stadium is immaculate, like the day we moved in,’ said Williams. ‘It doesn’t matter Chelsea are coming to town, it could be Accrington, no disrespect, but we want to do it right off the field. ‘On the field we like to get it down and play. We know we’re a country mile away from Chelsea in terms of the ability they have but our lads will relish it. Some of our lads have the ability to play in the Premier League or Championship. ‘We want to give a good account of ourselves. We don’t want it be a cricket score. We want people to see what we do and come back. ‘We are heading in the right direction after last year’s disappointment. Our manager is very proactive. There are one or two of us who call him Micky Mourinho. ‘He is a great manager with a great future in the game. His attention to detail and organisation is among the best I’ve ever worked with. ‘I’m sure the club will make sure there is a nice glass of red wine in his office for Jose after the game.’ This will be their night, with almost 10,000 crammed in baying for another upset. Mourinho should take a strong enough outfit not to become another name etched on League Cup's growing list of casualties.

"Ten bodies of people taken away in the dead of night and killed during the earliest part of the Yugoslavian wars have been discovered in a mass grave near a slaughterhouse. It is hoped the find finally solves the mystery of Sotin, a Croatian village near Vukova. Thirteen residents of the village were killed by Serbs during the . night on December 26, 1991. A mass grave has been discovered in a slaughterhouse in Sotin, Croatia. It is believed the bodies belong to people taken away in the dead of night and killed during the earliest part of the Yugoslavian wars . The human remains found were mixed with particles of animal. It is hoped the find finally solves the mystery of Sotin, a Croatian village near Vukova . Thirteen residents of the village were killed by Serbs during the night on December 26, 1991 . The find is being seen as the first indication of official cooperation between the Government of Croatia and the Serbian authorities on the issue of missing persons . Croatia’s deputy war veterans minister Bojan Glavasevic said that remains of ten people, believed to belong to those taken, had been exhumed from a mass grave . It comes after three bodies were discovered elsewhere in the village last week. Glavasevic said it was probable that the ten bodies had been moved  in 1997 from the grave . discovered last week. They had been buried in a trench used for disposing of animal remains next to an abattoir, and the human remains were mixed with animal particles. The find comes after a collaborative investigation by the Zagreb and Belgrade authorities. After 22 years this is seen as the first indication . of official cooperation between the Government of Croatia and the . Serbian authorities on the issue of missing persons. In February, an investigation was launched against several wartime Serb . fighters. Authorities were investigating the killing of 16 Croatian civilians in Sotin from October 1991 . until the end of the year, Balkan Insight reports. Two former police and territorial defence officers in Sotin, Zarko Milosevic and Dragan Loncar, were arrested on war crimes charges on February 4. During the war, 64 people in total were killed in the small village, which lies east of Vukovar .

During the war, 64 people in total were killed in the small village, which lies east of Vukovar . The prosecutor in Belgrade told Balkan Insight: 'Milosevic and Loncar, together with other members of the police and territorial defence forces, arrested more than ten civilians and detained them at the police station. 'On December 26, 1991, they put them in an army truck and took them to an unknown location and killed them with automatic weapons.' During the war, 64 people in total were killed in the small village, which lies . east of Vukovar. Vukovar, dubbed 'Croatia's . Stalingrad' because of the devastation wrought on it in the attack, fell . to the Yugoslav Army and Serb fighters in . November 1991 after a devastating siege. Prisoners of war sought refuge . in a hospital. When the city fell, Serbian troops . seized the prisoners. At least 200 were taken to a pig farm in Ovcara . two miles away and beaten, tortured and then killed. Their bodies were . also found in mass graves. This is the fifth case that Serbia’s war crime prosecutor has launched over alleged war crimes around Vukovar. The previous four cases related to crimes committed at the Ovcara farm. Serbian courts have so far found 15 people guilty of war crimes in Vukovar and sentenced them to a total of 207 years in prison. The Yugoslav Army and Serbian paramilitary units besieged Vukovar for three months in 1991. It followed Croatia’s declaration of independence from Yugoslavia, and thousands of non-Serbs were expelled when the town was captured.","13 people taken from Sotin, a Croatian village, during 1991 Yugoslav war .

"It might sound like it has come straight out of a Star Wars film, but the International Space Station (ISS) is set to get a huge ‘laser cannon’ by the end of this year. This laser, however, may leave Darth Vader a little underwhelmed, as instead of destroying the planet it will be used to study it in more detail. Named the Cloud Aerosol Transport System, dubbed Cats, it will look at the distribution of aerosols in space to map pollution and changes in the climate. The size of a refrigerator, Cats will provide detailed information about the particles in Earth's atmosphere . Aerosols are the tiny particles that make up haze, dust, air pollutants, and smoke and could have far-reaching on the planet’s environment, . When Iceland’s Eyjafjallajökull volcano erupted nearly four years ago, for instance, officials grounded flights in Europe. They believed particles contained within its massive plume could damage aircraft engines, resulting in potentially deadly consequences for passengers. Nasa couldn’t dispatch aircraft-borne instruments for the very same reasons European officials had grounded commercial aircraft. The laser is scheduled to launch to the space station later this year as a demonstration project and will fire around 5,000 laser pulses per second . The Cloud-Aerosol Transport System (Cats) will provide measurements of the particulate contents within the atmosphere including clouds and aerosols. A powerful laser will provide data on the location, composition and distribution of atmospheric elements which impact the climate on a global scale. This refrigerator-sized sensor laser is . scheduled to launch to the space station in late this year as a demonstration . project and will fire around 5,000 laser pulses per second. Long-term data from the laser may reveal  shifts in global climate over time and location. But using Cats, when the next volcano erupts, Nasa will be able to monitor the spread of particles in Earth’s atmosphere from its space-based perch. This refrigerator-sized sensor laser is scheduled to launch to the space station in late 2014 as a demonstration project and will fire around 5,000 laser pulses per second. Its sensors will help researchers determine for the first time exactly what laser technology can do from space to measure tiny airborne particles - also known as aerosols - in Earth’s atmosphere. Developed by scientist Matt McGill, and his team, Cats will be able to see the character as well as vertical and horizontal distribution of aerosols in a whole new light. The laser may leave Darth Vader a little underwhelmed, as instead of destroying the planet, like the Death Star (pictured), it will be used to study the Earth in more detail . This will deliver more detailed information and could help scientists differentiate between the types of particles in the atmosphere. ‘You get better data quality because you make fewer assumptions, and you get, presumably, a more accurate determination of what kind of particles you’re seeing in the atmosphere,’ said Dr McGill. Knowing where aerosols are located in the atmosphere - such as smoke from forest fires, dust blowing off vast deserts, and plumes from erupting volcanoes - is often critically important. The station travels in a precessing orbit, which means that instead of passing over the same spot at the same time, its orbit moves. By reflecting sunlight into space, clouds help regulate the Earth's climate. This image was taken from aboard the International Space Station, which is where Cats will measure cloud aerosols . The station’s ground track moves westward along each of 16 daily tracks as it travels, with ground track repeats every three days. As a result, CATS will provide good coverage of what’s happening over primary population centres. In addition, the station passes over and along many of the primary aerosol-transport paths within Earth’s atmosphere. One of Earth’s primary transport routes for airborne pollutants is from Asia. Particles are transported by circulation cells in Earth’s atmosphere over Japan, northward up just under Alaska, and then down towards the West Coast of the United States, making a big, inverted ‘U’ shape. Long-term data from the laser may also reveal the shifts in global climate over time and location. In 2010, Iceland's Eyjafjallajökull volcano erupted, creating an expansive ash cloud that disrupted air traffic throughout Europe and across the Atlantic. The Cloud-Aerosol Transport System (Cats) could improve the ability to measure volcanic particles and other aerosols from space .","Cloud Aerosol Transport System, dubbed Cats, to be installed this year .

"A woman who pleaded no contest to breaking into reality television starlet Audrina Patridge's home has been sentenced to four years in prison. Rachel Lee, 21, is the second member of the so-called 'Bling Ring' gang to be sentenced for their role in a rash of break-ins at celebrities' homes that netted more than $3million (£1.9million) in luxury goods. The group targeted the Los Angeles homes of stars including Orlando Bloom, Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan before members of the ring were arrested in late 2009. Rachel Lee, pictured outside Los Angeles Superior Court for a previous hearing, was yesterday sentenced to four years in prison after admitting breaking into the home of reality TV star Audrina Patridge (right) Lee was arrested in January 2010 and later pleaded no contest to the February 2009 burglary of The Hills star Patridge's Hollywood Hills home. More than $25,000 (£15,650) in designer luggage, jewellery, clothing and shoes were taken from the property, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. A hearing will be held at a later date to determine how much Lee has to repay. Superior Court Judge Larry Fidler dismissed a conspiracy to commit burglary charge and two counts of receiving stolen property that had been filed against Lee. The judge had previously dismissed a charge against Lee related to the Lohan burglary. Four other alleged members of the crew, including accused ringleader Nicholas Prugo, are awaiting trial.

"These shocking images show men and women tanning leather for a pittance in one of the world's most polluted locations. A young woman no older than 16 is captured at the Hazaribagh toxic leather tannery in Dhaka, Bangladesh, which is ranked among the 30 most polluted places in the world.

"It is too dangerous for any western journalist to enter Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, now under the brutal control of ISIS. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Syria  is a group so extreme in its use of violence that even Al Qaeda has distanced itself. But on Thursday I managed to reach Mosul’s outskirts and saw thousands of refugees streaming out along the highway towards the northern Kurdish city of Irbil. The other carriageway was desolate. In a special dispatch, Rageh Omar visits the Kaywan Base in Kirkuk - where he found equipment left by the US had been burnt and charred by rebels, some devastation from the area pictured . Iraqi families arrive at a checkpoint in the town of al-Muafakiya, 80 kms west of Arbil after fleeing their homes . While the journalist was on dispatch, pictured, ISIS kidnapped a Kurdish TV crew and a Turkish diplomat . Credible eyewitnesses from inside the city told me of ISIS executions. One elderly couple said that as they left their neighbourhood they passed the corpses of three men who had been shot in the head and left in the street - a public warning. One former editor of a local paper who has now gone into hiding, told me that on Tuesday morning, the day ISIS moved into Mosul, he heard female screams and gunfire in a street behind his house. He immediately told his wife and twin son and daughter to grab only the most basic essentials, and they left. He went to his sister’s house and urged her to leave as well.  A UN report yesterday said there is indeed evidence that  ISIS fighters were carrying out rapes in Mosul. Volunteers who have joined the Iraqi Army to fight against the predominantly Sunni militants, who have taken over Mosul and other Northern provinces, gesture from an army truck in Baghdad . A picture taken with a mobile phone shows a vehicle ablaze on a road in Hawijah, west of Kirkuk, in northern Iraq . An image made available by the jihadist Twitter account Al-Baraka news allegedly shows Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ISIS militants taking position at a Iraqi border post . Another image is claimed to show ISIS militants taking position at the border . Mosul, capital of a major province with a population of nearly 4 million people is now the new capital of what the whole region -  the beginnings of what could soon be an Al Qaeda inspired Islamic mini-state. It is hard to over-emphasise the significance.  A Jihadi group in control of a major Middle Eastern city and access to US supplied heavy weapons, munitions and armoured vehicles abandoned by the Iraqi army. ISIS says it wants to rule according to its own version of sharia law, but it also needs to keep the city functioning. On Thursday it urged public sector workers especially in electricity and water to return to work, promising them that they would be paid. Many of them have answered ISIS’s call.  What other option do they have? An ITV news cameraman filmed an extraordinary scene on Friday as a black-clad ISIS fighter was transformed from a Jihadi insurgent into a traffic policeman. Peshmerga fighters provide security at the last checkpoint outside of Mosul which is currently under control of ISIS militants . People have their passports processed at a checkpoint next to a temporary displacement camp on Kalak, Iraq, as thousands flee Mosul following the ISIS takeover . Families arrive at a Kurdish checkpoint in Kalak having left Mosul in an attempt to get to safety . He re-directed cars as electricity workers manouevered a cherry-picker in order to reach a tangle of cables. A large artillery field-gun looted from an Iraqi army base sat tied to a trailer on the other side of the road, canvas draped over its long barrel. I visited the vast Kaywan military base, in the city of Kirkuk just two hours drive from Mosul - a network of armouries, living quarters, firing ranges, storage depots. The basketball courts and exercise field built by the Americans are still there.  But the expensive military hardware left to the Iraqi army by the US lies burnt and charred, strewn across the place with the personal belongings dropped by rapidly fleeing Iraqi soldiers. Their underpants and toothpaste, lies alongside the rocket propelled grenades and artillery training manuals they left behind. Whilst I was there reports came through that ISIS had kidnapped a local Kurdish TV crew in addition to Turkish diplomats. The lessons of its brutal and nihilistic violence are not not lost on anyone.

"Barbie is set to make her transition from the toy shelf to the big screen in a new live-action movie. According to Deadline, Mattel and Sony have teamed up on a movie starring the iconic doll, which is expected to go into production by the end of this year. The film will reportedly allow Barbie 'to use her personal and professional . skills to step into the lives of others and improve them, almost like a . modern-day Mary Poppins'. In a Barbie world: Barbie is set to make her transition from the toy shelf to the big screen in a new live-action movie produced by Sony, which is expected to go into production by the end of the year . Mattel and Sony announced on Wednesday that the movie will be written by What a Girl Wants writer Jenny Bicks and produced by Walter F Parkes and Laurie MacDonald, the husband-and-wife team behind Men in Black 3. A big part of the appeal of the film, says studio chief Amy Pascal, is that it will focus on Barbie not only as a plaything for current youngsters, but also as a source of nostalgia for older generations that grew up with the doll. It is also expected to emphasize the doll as a symbol of female empowerment. Tim Kilpin, Mattel’s EVP of Global Brands, said of the project: 'Barbie has entertained children and inspired their imagination and creativity for more than 50 years. 'Now is the right time in Barbie's celebrated history for her to star in a live-action, contemporary comedy that brings her playful personality to life for generations of fans.' 'Now is the right time in Barbie's celebrated history for her to star in a contemporary comedy' A source told the Hollywood Reporter that the plot will 'team Barbie with an overworked bureaucrat looking for an assistant. A contemporary buddy comedy ensues.' This isn't the first collaboration between Mattel and Sony; the companies are also currently developing a film adaptation of Masters of the Universe. Toy-inspired movies are certainly having a moment this year. February saw the release of the Lego Movie, starring Chris Pratt and Elizabeth Banks as the voices of some of the toys. The 3D film was a commercial blockbuster, raking in more than $441million worldwide, which made it the highest-grossing movie of 2014 so far. A sequel is expected to be released in the summer of 2017.","Mattel has joined forced with Sony on the film, which is expected to go into production by the end of the year ."
"American Girl has sparked outrage among consumers following its announcement that two racially diverse dolls from its Historical range will be 'retired' - forcing the company to defend their decision. 'Cecile', of African-American descent and 'Ivy', who is Asian-American, will join two Caucasian dolls in being discontinued - a blow to the hoard of consumers who feel there now won't be enough racial diversity in the range. The company was forced to defend its decision in a statement, claiming that it was a business decision and it is simply doing away with dolls that come in pairs. The chop! Four dolls from American Girl's 'Historical' range have been discontinued, including one African-American and one Asian-American (pictured right), much to the disappointment of many customers . American Girl PR Stephanie Spanos told MailOnline: 'We’ve . decided to move away from the friend-character strategy'. Both . African-American Cecile and Asian-American Ivy happen to be in pairs, . as do Caucasians Marie-Grace and Ruthie, which is allegedly why they are . being discontinued. American Girl first announced their plans on Facebook last week. 'Soon, . we’ll say farewell to Marie-Grace, Cécile, Ruthie, and Ivy. Complete . your collection while supplies last - quantities are extremely limited' the statement reads. More than 1,100 Facebook comments flooded in following the news. The current cast: American Girl is doing away with the friendship pairs (pictured) which happen to include two racially diverse dolls, insisting this is the only reason they are being retired, not because of their ethnicity . 'I guess Asians are no longer an important demographic to the American Girl company', complained one user. 'That would suck if you retire Addy next. She is the only African American doll left', mused another. A closer inspection of the new changes however, reveals that some could be jumping to conclusions too quickly. The company's Historical range, which celebrates various periods of American history, currently features 11 dolls, all priced at $110 each. Five of the dolls are from ethnic minorities, and six are Caucasian - a reasonably equal spread. Blondes: American Girl has also been criticized for favoring the blonde dolls in its collection, none of which (pictured, Julie, Caroline and Kit) were retired in the company's latest shake-up to the range . American . Girl's new shake-up will leave seven dolls in the collection, four . Caucasians and three dolls of ethnic minority; Kaya, who is Nez Perce . (Native American), Josefina, who is Hispanic, and Addy, who is . African-American. 'Ivy and Cecile are the first two racially diverse characters to be archived out of nine in total since 2008' The . company hasn't yet announced details of the new dolls which will be . added to replace the four retired ones, except for the news that it will . be re-introducing Samantha Parkington, one of the original, Caucasian . characters. Ms Spanos, further explains that the company's decision to stop manufacturing four of the dolls has nothing to do with their appearances or ethnicity. 'American Girl has been archiving dolls from the historical collection since 2008, and the first seven dolls that we archived were Caucasian,' she says. 'Ivy and Cecile are the first two racially diverse characters to be archived out of nine in total since 2008.' Three remain: Kaya (left) is Native . American, Josephina (center) is Hispanic and Kaya (right) is African . American, and they will all remain in the collection, alongside four . Caucasian characters . History: Addy (pictured) became the first African-American doll to join the collection, in 1993, and will remain in the range . One of Facebook's many commentators took issue with this branding decision, referring to the soon-to-be extinct BFF's Marie-Grace and Cecile. 'This was a beautiful inter racial friendship....I LOVED it for that very reason. It is great for breaking down racism,' the comment reads. 'I'm tired of the ""diversity of blondes"" and pepto-puke-pink clothes. If I wanted that for girls in my life, I'd just buy a Barbie' Upon studying the collection, we can see that if American Girl is guilty of favoring any specific characteristics over others, it appears to be its hair color preferences. All three blonde dolls from the Historical range avoided an early retirement, while the two Caucasians to be discontinued are both brunette. '[I'm] tired of the ""diversity of blondes"" and pepto-puke-pink clothes. If I wanted that for girls in my life, I'd just buy a Barbie,' rants one commenter. 'I'm just sick of blonde doll after blonde doll when human hair comes in so many amazing colors... toys should reflect that,' writes another. Choices, choices: American Girl is most popular for its 'create your own doll' service, which allows customers to purchase dolls with whichever features they want . It's not the first time American Girl, which has sold more than 23 million dolls since its launch in 1986, has faced angry complaints. When Addy, the company's first African-American historical character, was initially portrayed as a slave, there was resounding disapproval. And in 2005, Catholic and pro-life groups criticized the company for donating funds to an organization which promotes abortion rights and acceptance of homosexuality. Still, let's not forget that American Girl's main attraction remains its 'create your own doll' service, which allows customers to build a doll with whatever features they desire.","Four dolls will be 'retired' from American Girl's Historical range, two Caucasians, one African-American and one Asian-American .

"Dental patients are being forced to travel long distances because practices nearby are refusing to take on new patients. Stock image used . Patients are being struck off by NHS dentists for failing to attend just one check-up, an investigation has found. Others are having to travel to surgeries 40 miles away because those nearby are refusing to take-on new patients. Some NHS dental practices have waiting lists of two years which is leading to many patients giving up and paying hundreds for private treatment. Research by Healthwatch England, which campaigns for patients’ rights, found that only 1 in 5 surgeries are taking on new patients. And in some cases dentists are striking patients off for failing to attend a check-up even when there are exceptional circumstances. One woman from Bolton was deregistered for missing an appointment because she was visiting her husband in hospital with cancer. Another 65-year-old man in Kirklees, West Yorkshire, rang his practice needing new dentures only to be told he had inexplicably been removed from their system. The surgery refused to re-register him as it wasn’t taking on any more NHS patients so he was forced to pay £760 to have them done privately. He said: ‘I’m a 65 year old pensioner, I called up my dentist for new dentures. I was told that that I was “no longer on our computer”. ‘They advised me to call them every month to check if they were taking NHS patients, but they were only taking on private patients. In the end I had to go private and pay £760 for new dentures and I am on pension credits. ‘It’s degrading ringing up lots of people, I shouldn’t have to jump through hoops to get new dentures.' Meanwhile a practice in Plymouth, Devon, says patients living 40 miles away in mid Cornwall are calling up to register on their books. Anna Bradley, Chair of Healthwatch England, said: ‘We hear a lot in the news about people struggling to access their GPs but it would seem getting an appointment with an NHS dentist is even more frustrating.’ ‘Patients are constantly being fed confusing and inaccurate information about who is and isn’t currently offering NHS treatment, and are feeling like they have to opt for costly private treatments such as hygienist appointments so that they don’t get struck off the books. Anna Bradley, chair of Healthwatch England, said the delays were 'simply not acceptable' ‘It’s simply not acceptable and such basic consumer concerns must be addressed when the Dentist Contract comes up for renewal next year.’ The watchdog – which was set up in 1991 – rang round 300 of the 8,000 NHS dental surgeries in England to enquire if they were taking on new patients. On average just 40 per cent were although in Yorkshire and Humber the figure was just 1 in 5. Another patient in Kirklees said: ‘I have been looking for a dentist for over 3 months and have still not found one. ‘I have rung the dentist but they keep advising me to call back after 2 weeks. I am now in extreme pain. I have contacted all local dentists but they are all saying that they will only take on private patients. ‘I don't want to be going to A&E but the problem is getting worse, if I had been seen 3 months ago then I might not be in the pain that I am in today.’ Concerns have been raised about the state of NHS dentristy since a contract introduced by Labour in 2006 designed to improve efficiency. But it resulted in many surgeries stopping accepting new patients and up to a million are thought to have lost access to an NHS dentist as a result. Dentists earn an average of £74,000 although the contract which sets out how they are paid is due to be renegotiated next year.","Patients struck off by NHS dentists for failing to attend just one check-up .

"Amina Begum had never seen a computer until a few years ago, but now she's on Skype regularly with her husband. A woman on a bicycle brings the Internet to her. Dozens of 'Info Ladies' bike into remote Bangladeshi villages with laptops and Internet connections, helping tens of thousands of people - especially women - get everything from government services to chats with distant loved ones. It's a vital service in a country where only five million of 152 million people have Internet access. Window to the world: Info Lady Mehedi Akthar Misty (right) helps Amina Begum, 45, to talk to her husband via Skype in the village of Jharabarsha . Vital service: Four Bangladeshi Info Ladies pedal their way through Saghata, a remote impoverished farming village in Gaibandha district, with their laptops and internet connections . The Info Ladies project, created in 2008 by local development group D.Net and other community organizations, is modelled after a programme that helped make cellphones widespread in Bangladesh. It intends to enlist thousands more workers in the next few years with start-up funds from the South Asian country's central bank and expatriates working around the world. D.Net recruits the women and trains them for three months to use a computer, the Internet, a printer and a camera. It arranges bank loans for the women to buy bicycles and equipment. 'This way we are providing jobs to jobless women and at the same time empowering villagers with critical information,' said Ananya Raihan, D.Net's executive director. The women - usually undergraduates from middle-class rural families - aren't doling out charity. Begum pays 200 takas ($2.40) for an hour of Skype time with her husband, who works in Saudi Arabia. Begum smiles shyly when her husband's cheerful face pops up. With earphones in place, she excitedly tells him she received the money he sent last month. He asks her to buy farm land. Even Begum's elderly mother-in-law now uses Skype to talk with her son. 'We prefer using Skype to mobile phones because this way we can see him on the screen,' Begum said, beaming happily from her tiny farming village in Gaibandha district, 120 miles (192 kilometers) north of the capital, Dhaka. Focal point: Info Lady Sathi Akhtar, 29, plays a 15-minute video on a laptop as part of a weekly meeting with villagers in Saghata, a remote farming village 120 miles north of Dhaka . Crucial information: A group of Bangladeshi girls, aged between 12 and 17, hold a courtyard meeting to learn about menstruation, reproductive health and HIV led by an Info Lady . In the neighbouring village of Saghata, an Info Lady is 16-year-old Tamanna Islam Dipa's connection to social media. 'I don't have any computer, but when the Info Lady comes I use her laptop to chat with my Facebook friends,' she said. 'We exchange our class notes and sometimes discuss social issues, such as bad effects of child marriage, dowry and sexual abuse of girls.' The Info Ladies also provide a slew of social services - some for a fee and others for free. They sit with teenage girls where they talk about primary health care and taboo subjects like menstrual hygiene, contraception and HIV. They help villagers seeking government services write complaints to authorities under the country's newly-enacted Right to Information Act. They talk to farmers about the correct use of fertilizer and insecticides. For 10 takas (12 cents) they help students fill college application forms online. They're even trained to test blood pressure and blood sugar levels. 'The Info Ladies are both entrepreneurs and public service providers,' Raihan said. Raihan borrowed the idea from Bangladeshi Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, who in 2004 introduced mobile phones to rural women who had no access to telephones of any kind, by training and sending out scores of 'Mobile Ladies' into the countryside. Pedal power: The Info Ladies on the road to Saghata. Their service of bringing internet and computer services to remote villages has proved invaluable for thousands . Weekly meeting: Shemoli Rani Das listens intently to a weekly meeting held by the Info Ladies in the village of Saghata . That hugely successful experiment drew in commercial mobile phone operators. Now more than 92 million people in Bangladesh have cellphone access. Nearly 60 Info Ladies are working in 19 of Bangladesh's 64 districts. By 2016, Raihan hopes to train 15,000 women. In July, Bangladesh's central bank agreed to offer interest-free loans to Info Ladies. Distribution of the first phase of loans, totaling 100 million takas ($1.23 million), will begin in December. Raihan said D.Net is also encouraging the large population of Bangladeshi expatriates to send money home to help Info Ladies get started. 'It's very innovative,' says Jamilur Reza Chaudhury, a pioneer of information technology education in Bangladesh. 'The project is really having an impact on the people at grass-root level.' Info Lady Sathi Akhtar, who works in Begum's and Dipa's villages, said she makes more at the job than she would as a school teacher. She said that after making payments on her 120,000 taka ($1,480) loan and covering other costs, she takes home an average of 10,000 takas ($123) a month. 'We are not only earning money, we are also contributing in empowering our women with information. That makes us happy.'","The Info Ladies bike hundreds of miles, bringing laptop computers and internet connections to thousands in impoverished farming villages .

"A second senior judge can be revealed today as a campaigner for the rights of members of a vile paedophile group that tried to legalise sex with children. Peter Thornton, the Chief Coroner for England and Wales, publicly declared that his campaign group ‘supported the civil liberties of everyone including paedophiles’. A Mail on Sunday investigation has discovered that he openly criticised the prosecution of the infamous Paedophile Information Exchange, even after its leader was jailed at the Old Bailey. Defence: Peter Thornton, the Chief Coroner for England and Wales, publicly declared that his campaign group 'supported the civil liberties of everyone including paedophiles' And he wrote that he backed a ‘reduction in the age of consent for both homosexuals and heterosexuals to 14’ when he ran a high-profile civil liberties organisation. Documents uncovered by this newspaper show that Mr Thornton, then a barrister, also defended one of the vile child sex campaigners in court. The news follows our revelations last week that an Appeal Court judge Lord Justice Fulford was a founder of a support group for PIE members ahead of their prosecution. And today it can be revealed that Fulford also represented a PIE leader at the Old Bailey more than ten years after his initial involvement in the campaign. While a barrister, Peter Thornton (pictured) represented PIE's Peter Bremner at his trial. He said he had a professional obligation to accept any brief . The new details will put further pressure on Labour grandees Patricia Hewitt, Harriet Harman and Jack Dromey, who were all leading figures in the National Council for Civil Liberties when Thornton was its chairman. They have insisted the paedophiles who joined the group had been marginalised by the late 1970s, but Mr Thornton was still defending their rights in NCCL’s newsletters as late as 1983. Last night the former Old Bailey judge, 67, said he did not recall supporting a lower age of consent or representing a PIE leader, and expressed regret that paedophile activists were linked to the NCCL for so long. There are growing calls for a full investigation into the influence of PIE, which openly campaigned for the age of consent to be lowered to just four, and which received invaluable help from some on the Left. Peter Saunders, of the National Association For People Abused In Childhood, said: ‘Shame on the NCCL for ever going down this route. Everybody has always known that paedophiles want to harm children. ‘This strengthens our call for a Royal Commission into this whole murky affair – there are clearly many Establishment figures involved.’ Documents uncovered by The Mail on Sunday reveal for the first time the role played by Mr Thornton in defending PIE. He attacked the prosecution months after PIE was described in court as a ‘force for evil’, and its chairman Tom O’Carroll was jailed for two years for the rare offence of conspiracy to corrupt public morals. Mr Thornton wrote that the case was an ‘expensive and largely unsuccessful’ attempt to revive the ancient law, ‘dangerous not only for the defendant at risk of a prison sentence but also for the prosecutor at risk of exposure for vindictiveness’. In a lengthy article published in the NCCL’s newsletter, Rights, in November 1981, he claimed that although PIE members ‘had been sending pretty unattractive porn to each other’, police could not nail the organisers for what they wrongly believed to be an ‘introduction to sex with children racket’. Corrupted debate: David Joy and Steven Smith, pictured, were both prominent members of the Paedophile Information Exchange to be jailed. Smith was represented in court by Adrian Fulford, now a High Court judge, who also said he would have been obligated to take the case . A retrial meant ‘more expense’ and ‘more worry for those in the dock’ and after only one defendant, O’Carroll, was convicted, Mr Thornton claimed this was ‘hardly a justification’ for launching the case. The PIE members were accused of trying to arrange sex with children through contact adverts, but Mr Thornton said their defence was that they were ‘lonely, isolated paedophiles getting in touch with others similarly cut-off from society by their emotional and sexual orientation’. He concluded the charge against PIE had been ‘vague, wordy, above all too remote from any tangible misdemeanour’. Mr Thornton added, however, that ‘child molesters and other sexual offenders should unquestionably be brought to account for specific offences under our extensive protective legislation’. This prompted a self-confessed paedophile to write to the magazine complaining that Thornton had not done enough to defend his rights. Mr Thornton wrote back in the spring 1983 issue to apologise for offending the paedophile and to insist that the NCCL – now known as Liberty – did have a radical stance on sexual law. He wrote: ‘Our policy… is to seek a reduction in the age of consent for both homosexuals and heterosexuals to 14. My remarks were not intended to infringe upon these proposals; nor were they intended to offend, and if they did I regret it. Civil rights: Allegations that paedophiles took advantage of the National Council for Civil Liberties' permissive nature gained traction because Harriet Harman (centre) and Patricia Hewitt (right) were senior figures . ‘I am happy to reaffirm that within the existing policy, NCCL supports the civil liberties of everybody including paedophiles and gays.’ In 1984, the year after he left the NCCL, Mr Thornton went on to act as counsel for PIE member Peter Bremner – who under the alias Roger Nash had attended gay rights meetings with judge Fulford – at his Old Bailey trial. According to press cuttings, Mr Thornton ‘told the jury that neither PIE nor its views were on trial’. Mr Thornton, married with two children, went on to become a QC and served as a circuit judge before being appointed the first Chief Coroner in England and Wales in 2012. In a statement to The Mail on Sunday, he pointed out he had ‘expressed the clear view, which I hold today, that paedophiles and sex offenders should be caught and punished’. Harriet Harman, pictured left in 1982, strenuously denied ever endorsing PIE leader Tom O'Carroll (right) Regarding his apologetic letter to the paedophile, Mr Thornton said: ‘I responded with a reference to what was then NCCL policy about the age of consent which was proposed as 14 for males and females. ‘I do not recall personally supporting that policy: my particular interests were policing, prisons and the administration of justice. ‘For the avoidance of all doubt, my view is that the current age of consent is correct.’ He added: ‘I am sorry the Paedophile Information Exchange had any connection with NCCL. I was chairman of NCCL when I believe PIE was ejected from NCCL, which was the right decision. ‘With hindsight it should have happened earlier. I never supported PIE or its aims in any way. Abuse of children, physical or sexual, is and always has been a terrible crime.’ Ian Pace, an academic and campaigner against abuse in musical education, said last night: ‘This is an extremely serious situation which demonstrates that the PIE network was able to infiltrate some of the upper echelons of British government and society in the 1970s and 1980s. This needs to be thoroughly investigated with proper resources and funding.’ Additional reporting: Stephen Johns and Peter Henn . Defence: Adrian Fulford, now Lord Justice Fulford . CASE ONE: THORNTON DEFENDS BREMNER, 1984 . Peter Thornton represented senior PIE figure Peter Bremner at his 1984 Old Bailey trial. Bremner was found guilty of sending obscene material in the post and jailed for six months. He was cleared of incitement to commit sexual offences with children. Fellow PIE man David Joy was also jailed. Mr Thornton said yesterday: ‘I do not recall details about the trial of anyone called Peter Bremner. 'Every client I represented would have been because of the professional obligation to accept any brief in a court in which I practised.’ CASE TWO: FULFORD DEFENDS SMITH, 1991 . Adrian Fulford was the barrister for PIE’s last chairman, Steven Smith, in 1991. The former Home Office security guard should have stood trial with Bremner but fled to Holland and was only deported years later. Smith finally appeared at the Old Bailey in December 1991 where he admitted publishing an obscene magazine and sending it through the post, receiving an 18-month sentence. Last night a spokesman for Fulford said: ‘He does not recall this case but he is in absolutely no doubt that he would only have taken it under the “cab rank” rule because he was asked to. He would not have volunteered to take it.’ The top judge exposed as a campaigner for a vile paedophile group is now under official investigation for misconduct. Lord Justice Fulford was revealed by The Mail on Sunday last week to have been a founder of a ‘defence committee’ for the Paedophile Information Exchange while it was openly calling for the age of consent to be cut to just four. He discussed holding courtroom protests at meetings with PIE chairman Tom O’Carroll – who was jailed for two years in 1981 for conspiracy to corrupt public morals – and wrote articles claiming O’Carroll’s trial was an ‘act of oppression’ because the child sex campaigners only wanted to ‘make friends’. Exposed: How The Mail on Sunday covered the story of Lord Justice Fulford last week . Following our story, horrified members of the public made a string of complaints about the senior judge and the official watchdog for the judiciary has agreed to launch an investigation into his conduct. Fulford, who was last year appointed to the Privy Council – an elite circle of advisers to the Queen – has offered not to sit on any criminal cases at the Court of Appeal until the investigation is completed. If the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office finds he should have declared his involvement with the paedophile groups, or that his support for them brought him into disrepute, he could face disciplinary action from Justice Secretary Chris Grayling and Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd. Details of the exact allegations made against Fulford are not being made public. A spokesman for the watchdog said: ‘The JCIO has received a number of complaints in relation to Lord Justice Fulford. The JCIO has started an investigation in accordance with the Judicial Conduct (Judicial and other office holders) Rules 2013. ‘Lord Justice Fulford has voluntarily refrained from sitting in criminal cases pending the outcome of the investigation.’ Lord Justice Fulford, 61, said: ‘I positively welcome that this will be the subject of a detailed and independent investigation.’ A senior QC said: ‘Fulford’s stepping down from criminal appeals is unprecedented. He was appointed for his criminal expertise and he really has no other specialisation.’","Peter Thornton publicly declared support for paedophiles' 'civil liberties'

Ownership of the £400million craft is . shrouded in secrecy but it is rumoured to have been paid for by a member . of the Saudi royal family, Alwaleed Bin Talal Alsaud. Longer than 12 double-decker buses, . not only is Azzam the biggest superyacht, it is also expected to be one . of the fastest. The 94,000 horsepower vessel could reach speeds of more . than 30 knots, or 35mph. The size of superyachts has grown as . billionaires compete to own the largest and its builders boast that . Azzam, which means dedication in Arabic, is the 'most complex and . challenging yacht that has ever been built'. It was designed by Nauta Yachts and constructed in Bremen by Lurssen. The firm's Peter Lurssen said: 'She truly represents another milestone in yachting history.' Little is known about the interior of . the yacht, which will require a staff of 50 and will be delivered to its . owner later this year. But it is likely to match the luxury . of Abramovich's Eclipse, which features an armour-plated master suite, . two swimming pools, two helipads, a hall, a cinema, a mini-submarine and . even its own missile defence system. Longer than some cruise ships: Azzam is described as the 'most complex and challenging yacht' ever built . No expense spared: New super-yacht Azzam has taken one year to design and three years to build . Abramovich has owned Eclipse, which is . valued at £740million, since it was launched in 2010. It took the title . of world's biggest private yacht from the 454ft Rising Sun, owned by . American businessman Larry Ellison, which in turn took over from the . 414ft Octopus, owned by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. Prince Alwaleed, who is said to be . worth around £10billion, already has Nabil, a yacht formerly owned by . Saudi Arabian arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, in his fleet. If he is confirmed as the owner of Azzam, it will be the second time the 58-year-old has got the better of Abramovich. The 46-year-old Russian was denied a . berth at Antibes harbour on the French Riviera in 2011 as the prince had . docked another of his yachts, the 265ft Kingdom 5KR, in the last . remaining space. Eclipse's crew pleaded for a berth but . were eventually forced to drop anchor at sea and travel to the . Russian's villa on a motorboat. Azzam's design suggests it has been . built for a buyer in the Middle East as it has about 50 suites but no . large open spaces on deck, said TheYachtPhoto's Peter Seyfferth. 'I have never seen an Arab-owned yacht with big parties and girls round the pool like the Russians have,' he said. 'It is unlikely it will leave its dock very often. It is more of a question of prestige, to have the world's largest yacht.' You wouldn't want to turn around in a hurry: Azzam is 54ft longer than Abramovich's yacht Eclipse . Abramovich's yacht Eclipse is smaller but boasts essentials such as two heliports,several jacuzzis and bulletproof glass . Plenty of room for the crew: The mystery buyer, whom some suspect may be a Saudi Royal, will have rooms to spare . At 590.6ft long, Azzam is longer than 12 double-decker buses parked end-to-end. At her widest point, known as the beam, Azzam measures 68.2ft, while her hull is 15.8ft deep. She's heavier than Eclipse, too, with an estimated gross tonnage of 14,000GT - roughly equivalent to 1,750 adult African elephants. Powered by two gas turbines and two diesel engines, she will boast an impressive 94,000 horsepower and a top speed in excess of 30 knots. The world's largest super-yacht, Azzam, has been commissioned for a mystery owner and launched in Germany today . Azzam's fuel tank can hold one million litres and she will have a top speed of in excess of 30 knots. It took the world's top engineers one . year to design Azzam and three years to build her - but this is . considered super-quick in ship-building terms. The owner of Azzam is rumoured to be a member of the Saudi Royal Family, but the whole project is shrouded in secrecy. Interior features will include a 29ft salon and a stunning, open-plan interior. French interior designer Christophe . Leoni was briefed to produce a sophisticated and yet timeless interior . with a turn-of-the-century, Empire style. Roman Abramovich's Eclipse is 533.1ft long and 72.2ft wide, and has an estimated gross tonnage of 13,500GT. Eclipse, owned by Abramovich, has been revered by yachting enthusiasts for years on account of her size . She has four diesel engines and a . maximum speed of 22 knots, which means Azzam will far outstrip her . should the billionaire owners decide to have a race. The yacht can accommodate 36 guests in . comfort, and boasts a cinema, conference facilities, children's . playroom, beauty salon, dance floor, swimming pool and sauna. Built by Blohm +Voss Shipyards and . designed inside and out by Terence Disdale, Eclipse was custom-made for . the Chelsea oligarch in 2010. Both ships are so huge, they would . have trouble fitting into the majority of the world's marinas.  Only a . handful, including Monaco and Antibes on the Riviera would be large . enough to accommodate them. However, despite Azzam eclipsing . Eclipse today, neither of them comes close to the Titanic in terms of . scale.  Built in 1912, the ill-fated Titanic was 882ft long and 92ft . wide.","New mega-yacht took four years to design and build and is largest in world .

"Duncan Edwards was my idol in the fifties... I was devastated after the Munich air disaster . George Best, Bobby Moore and Sir Bobby Charlton all make my team of the sixties . Duncan Edwards joins Billy Wright and Danny Blanchflower in my team of the fifties . Harry Redknapp is one of the game’s most colourful and outspoken characters. Here, in the final part of his brilliant book, he reflects on a footballing world before pilates, ice baths and prima donnas. ........................................................................... Lionel Messi reminds me of George Best, the way he would run with the ball tight to his foot. Tap, tap, tap. He would take the ball up to defenders like that, and then swivel and go past them. There were so many great players in that Manchester United team but, even then, George stood tall. He was fresh off the boat and straight into the first team. He didn’t really bother with youth football. I can remember reading the account by Harry Gregg, Manchester United’s goalkeeper, of the first time he met George. VIDEO Scroll down to watch one of George Best's greatest Manchester United goals . Manchester United legend George Best enjoys the attention on a beach in Majorca in 1968 . Great man, Harry — pulled semi-conscious injured team-mates out of a burning plane on the runway at Munich. That’s bravery. These days a midfielder receives the ball with a man marking him and we say he’s brave. Harry was also a hard man who almost used to bully opponents. Not the sort of chap that a young kid fresh over from Belfast should be messing with. The first training session George had at United, he got the ball, ripped through the defence and made to shoot. Gregg went one way, and George casually took the ball past him and rolled it into the net. Next attack, the same thing happened. ‘Do that to me again, son,’ Harry warned, from his position on the seat of his pants, ‘and you won’t be playing tomorrow.’ Yet George just laughed it off. That was what made him so magnificent. There is a fantastic clip of George playing against Chelsea. He is going through the defence, the mud is ankle deep, when Ron Harris comes across and tries to cut him in half. George rides it, carries on and slots the ball in. Best shoots for goal under pressure from former Chelsea hard man Ron 'Chopper' Harris . Best - pictured with his Lotus Europa car in 1969 - changed football forever . George went out every game knowing there were players whose job was to hurt him, who actively tried to break his legs. Yet they never stopped him demanding the ball, never stopped him running with it. I haven’t seen anybody as brave as George. He was the best; he had a style, a swagger when he played, that I don’t think I’ve seen since. And he changed football. Girls screaming at him, boys trying to dress like him. There were other good players and good teams but also a pub mentality that didn’t really leave English football until the influx of foreign players. From the great Liverpool team to the World Cup-winning England side and the King’s Road lot at Chelsea, just about every club liked a night out. Most of the teams were made up of local boys and they all got on great. At West Ham we mucked in together and roughed it when we had to. Again on holiday in Majorca, this time in 1967, Best enjoys a drink with boxer Johnny Prescott . I remember the terrible winter in 1963, clearing the snow off the forecourt at Upton Park with the rest of the players so we could train. Job done, we’d play on it for two hours in silly little plimsolls, sliding everywhere. These days, the medical staff would have conniptions about the damage you could do to your calf muscles. But nobody knew, or cared, about that side of the game. These days, if a training pitch isn’t like Wembley, the players complain. Modern players moan about everything. They’ll walk into a room with £200,000 of equipment and find some fault — no bananas in the fruit bowl or the temperature isn’t right. We used to spend a month running through forests, dodging cars on the Epping New Road. That was our pre-season. Get back on the coach with everybody cramping up. Nobody had heard of stretching exercises. We didn’t even warm up. Bobby Moore talks to young fans during a break in a West Ham training session in 1962 . The first time we saw the pitch was when the bell went to signal two minutes before kick-off. We might take the odd shot against the goalkeeper if we were feeling adventurous. There was no such thing as a warm-up. We thought a warm-up was standing by the radiator. Once the game started, if you went down, a bloke would come out, put a sponge on your leg and that was the extent of his knowledge done. No one complained. We didn’t know any different, we just got on with it. There were no agents to stir up a fuss. Contract negotiation was non-existent. The manager called you into his office and gave you another £2 a week and you went home delighted. Duncan Edwards was my idol in the fifties... I was devastated after the Munich air disaster .

I was fortunate to spend the Sixties working for one of the greatest football minds this country has ever produced: Ron Greenwood. It is no exaggeration to say that Ron changed the game in England. I remember watching the 1966 World Cup and I was able to pinpoint the moves and tactics that were straight from West Ham’s training ground. Former West Ham manager Ron Greenwood oversees England training in 1970 as Kevin Keegan stretches . West Ham players train at the Essex health centre on a dry pitch . People talk about master coaches in football and I’ll be frank and say I haven’t seen too many; but Ron was among the few. The way England got Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters to get across defenders at the near post — I would credit Ron for that. The goals that England scored in 1966 were no accident. I used to watch Ron work for hours with the pair of them — when to pull away, how to time the return run. A lot of what Ron did stands up today. I’m not ashamed to admit that I still use lessons from Ron. The front cover of Redknapp's new book, A Man Walks On To a Pitch, which is released on Thursday .

"Luis Suarez claims Liverpool would never have mounted their unexpected title challenge last season without him. The Uruguay international scored 31 Premier League goals as the Reds finished runners-up to Manchester City and insists he left Anfield a happy man this summer, when a £75million deal took him to Barcelona. That contrasted sharply with his feelings at the start of his final campaign in England, for which he was suspended as he was still serving some of his 10-game ban for biting Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic, and he was made to train on his own after trying to manufacture a move away.

'I appreciate all the work the team did but I missed six matches and scored all those goals in the Premier League without being the penalty-taker,' Suarez told Barca's official website. 'The truth is that I left very happy because if I hadn't had the attitude and mentality to want to lead the team forward, I don't think Liverpool would have done as well as they did either. 'Getting back into the Champions League was another target I had in mind.'

"It was the night when Princess Diana met Hollywood royalty – and wowed the White House with her dancing dexterity. In a midnight-blue silk velvet gown, watched admiringly by  Ronald and Nancy Reagan, the  princess swept around the room with John Travolta. Iconic: Princess Diana wore this stunning midnight-blue Victor Edelstein gown when she famously danced with John Travolta at a White House event hosted by Ronald Reagan in 1985 .

The Victor Edelstein dress, and the dance with the Saturday Night Fever star, helped establish Diana as a global fashion icon that night in 1985 when she and Prince Charles attended a  gala ball during their first tour of the U.S. together. And early yesterday its significance was recognised when the gown was sold for £510,000 – the highest price fetched in an auction of 14 of the princess’s outfits in Toronto. They were sold by an American, Maureen Rorech Dunkel, who bought them for £420,000 at a Christie’s auction in June 1997, two months before Diana’s death. The princess was at the time trying to raise money for her Aids and  cancer charities. 'Travolta dress': Victor Edelstein's iconic midnight blue velvet off-the-shoulder gown was part of an auction of 14 dresses which had all belonged to Diana . Line-up: The dresses were sold at auction in Toronto by private collector Maureen Rorech Dunke, who bought them at a charity auction by the Princess of Wales at Christie's in New York in June 1997 . Miss Dunkel, a Florida-based  entrepreneur who filed for bankruptcy last year, left the room before the auction began, apparently overcome with emotion. Although the outfits went for more than £2million in 25 minutes, some experts had forecast they would fetch double that. A dinner dress and tailcoat of  burgundy velvet Diana wore to  the premiere of Steel Magnolias  in 1990 was auctioned for £130,000, having been estimated to raise at  least £170,000.

"Harry Redknapp is one of the game’s most colourful and outspoken characters. Here, in the latest extract from his fascinating book, he reveals the clamour for Kenny Dalglish's signature and charts the beginning of English football's influx of foreign talent. Where are Gazza's friends when he needs them most? My team of the 1970s . My team of the 1980s . I go back a long way with Kenny Dalglish. He came for a trial at West Ham in 1966 and I would drive him to training. The 15-year-old Kenny was with us for two weeks — everyone in the country was trying to sign him. I had a little green Austin 1100 and would collect him and another Scottish lad, Jimmy Lindsay, from digs. Harry Redknapp was playing for West Ham United as a youngster when Kenny Dalglish trialed at the club . Redknapp (seen playing for West Ham) used to drive the 15-year-old Dalglish into training . Redknapp used to give lifts to Dalglish and Jimmy Lindsay from their digs in an Austin 1100 . Dalglish (seen scoring against Partick Thistle) was a wanted man and went on to sign for Celtic soon after . Dalglish as a youngster coming through the ranks . One Saturday morning we had a practice match and manager Ron Greenwood played him with the first-team players. One of the lads laid a ball to him and it was like fast-forwarding through the next 20 years of British football — he took it perfectly, dropped a shoulder, turned and curled it into the far corner of the net. Our reserves didn’t know what had hit them. Both sets of players just stopped and applauded. I can remember talking to Ron about him after that game. ‘Will we get him?’ I asked. ‘No chance,’ he said. ‘We’ve tried. Everybody wants him, but he’s going to Celtic.’ I don’t remember him being very talkative then, but I’m not sure I would have understood a word anyway. The strength of Kenny’s Glasgow accent is legendary. When Liverpool wanted to sign my son, Jamie, Kenny rang up to speak to us about it. I could hear my wife, Sandra, on the phone but I didn’t know who she was talking to. ‘I’m sorry,’ she kept saying. ‘I can’t understand your Scouse accent.’ She must have said it about four times. In the end, I heard her say the name Kenny. I took the phone, just in time to hear Kenny saying in the broadest Scottish tone you’ll ever hear, ‘Can ye nae understan’ me?’ Dalglish enjoyed eight  successful years at Celtic Park (pictured playing in an Old Firm derby against Rangers) Dalglish wheels away after scoring the winner for Liverpool at Stamford Bridge against Chelsea in 1985-86 . That’s my missus. She’s got to be about the only person who doesn’t know Kenny Dalglish is from Scotland. ‘I thought he was from Liverpool,’ she said. ‘No, he manages Liverpool — he was born in Glasgow,’ I replied. We got there in the end. Kenny was just a fantastic player. Absolutely world-class. He could hold the ball as well as any man twice his size; he could bring team-mates into play or take it on himself. He didn’t have pace, but that didn’t matter. His pace was in his head. He was the attacking equivalent of Bobby Moore, in that he read the play better than anybody. He scored 30 goals in his first season for Liverpool, including the winner in the 1978 European Cup final against Bruges. It allowed them to maintain this fantastic period of dominance in the English game. Graeme Souness played a huge role in Liverpool’s domination, too. Souness’s transfer fee, £350,000, sounds like a snip — but it was a record for a move between two English clubs in 1978 when he signed from Middlesbrough. He had glorious talent. And, just like Billy Bremner and Dave Mackay, he was happy whatever way you wanted to play the game. A pure football match, and he was the best player on the field. A tear-up, and he would be nastier than anybody. Souness seemed to have a particular problem with Peter Nicholas, a Welsh midfielder who played for Arsenal. In one game, Nicholas went in high on Graeme, and soon afterwards Souness put him out of football for two months. He was feared. Players thought he was evil and he liked intimidating people. That was part of his job. The only person I know he’s scared of is his wife, Karen. Dalglish with Graeme Souness after winning the 1984 Milk Cup  (left) and his iconic picture as a Red legend . Dalglish with manager Bob Paisley alongside the European Cup on the day he signed for Liverpool in 1977 . By the end of the 1970s, Ossie Ardiles, Ricky Villa (both Spurs), Arnold Muhren and Frans Thijssen (both Ipswich) had come to our game. It was the beginning of the thought process that foreign players were needed for the skilful jobs because our own players weren’t up to it. Much of the blame for that can be laid at the door of Charles Hughes. The former PE teacher became the assistant director of coaching at the Football Association and rose to a position of great power and influence in the game. Under him, we missed an opportunity, thinking that we could teach the Brazilians about football rather than the other way around. We told ourselves that Brazil were getting it wrong with all those passes! Ricky Villa (seen playing for Spurs against Aston Villa in 1978) was one of English football's first foreign imports . Tottenham also signed the mercurial Argentine Ossie Ardiles (pictured in the 1980s) in their ranks . Giggs would have solved England's problems... he was born to play left wing . Wenger heralded a change in English football... he introduced Prozone and scouting reports . Ravel Morrison has the class of Bale but his attitude is holding back his talent . Vieira and Keane are warriors... they were even prepared to do battle while working on TV! Why Redknapp fears that the English manager is in danger of becoming extinct . Vieira nearly crossed North London to join Spurs... and  Suarez was close to signing too . Pies in the canteen and throwing teacups at players... the Premier League killed all that! Sportsmail's Head of Sport Lee Clayton interviews Redknapp about his new book . Even now, there are very few British coaches bold enough to try to play a very technical game. The long ball, the quick fix, will always be easier. All of the coaching courses back then were run by men like Hughes. There was no flair — it was football as taught by PE instructors. Some of them had even been to Brazil, but they returned with some madcap ideas. Brazilian footballers hone their skills on the beach, we were told. It was where they learned to control a football and, we were informed, that was how we should do it, too. Where the manager of, say, Derby County was going to find a beach when his training ground was about 70 miles inland, I don’t know. I will never forget there was a silence as we digested this brilliant insight. Some years later, I heard it repeated in the company of no-nonsense manager Jim Smith. ‘The beach?’ he said. ‘In that case, why aren’t Torquay, Southend and f*****g Brighton and Hove Albion top of the league?’ They had no answer to that. Rodney Marsh (right, playing against Derby County) was a maverick while playing for Manchester City . Marsh undermined City manager Tony Book by calling the rookie 'f****** useless' Alan Hudson (centre) only earned two England caps despite being one of the top players in the country . The rest of Europe was moving towards total football, and we were going into an era when we stopped trusting our most skilful players. Alan Hudson (two caps), Tony Currie (17 caps), Stan Bowles (five caps), Rodney Marsh (nine caps), Peter Osgood (four caps) — England had players that, technically, could have made any team in the world. We just didn’t pick them. I cannot think of a bigger waste of talent in English football than Hudson’s two caps or Osgood’s four. Players like Hudson and Marsh were brilliant, but mavericks. When full back Tony Book took over at Manchester City, Rodney was in open rebellion. It got back to Book that Rodney had described him as f*****g useless. ‘If you think I’m f*****g useless, this is never going to work. Do you want to take it back?’ Book said. ‘Actually,’ Rodney replied, unrepentant, ‘I don’t think you’re as good as that.’ Sportsmail can exclusively reveal Redknapp's greatest XI from the 1970s - to include Dalglish and Souness .

"Having run the gauntlet of sibling rivalry at the family home in Auckland from the age of four, it's perhaps no surprise that Ken Pisi developed such lethal, evasive footwork. His ability to dance his way out of trouble has been honed through years of attempting to emulate his older brothers, Tusi and George. Now he and George are running amok on behalf of Northampton – adding a major dash of Samoan sparkle alongside the Saints' English core. Last weekend, the pair of them were try-scorers as the Aviva Premiership champions thrashed Sale 43-10 at Franklin's Gardens and director of rugby, Jim Mallinder, made a special point of acclaiming Ken's exploits on the wing this season. Having touched down himself following a quick-step break, the 25-year-old then teed up George for a swallow-dive finish which captured the attention of every nearby camera lens. Ken Pisi (left) and his brother George Pisi pose together during a photocall at Franklin's Gardens . The Samoan brothers were key players in Norhtampton's Aviva Premiership winning side last season . George Pisi dives over for Northampton against Sale at Franklin's Gardens on Saturday afternoon . Ken Pisi also got on the score sheet to keep Northampton firmly on top of the table . James and Ross Chisholm (Harlequins) Alesana and Andy Tuilagi (Newcastle) Billy and Mako Vunipola (Saracens) Ben and Tom Youngs (Leicester) Alex and Ethan Waller (Northampton) George and Ken Pisi (Northampton) Sat together after training this week, ahead of Saturday's Champions Cup showdown with Racing Metro in Paris, George reflected on a job well done seven days ago, saying: 'It wasn't bad – the little one did well, and he set up a try for the old fella too!' The 'little one' was happy to provide an assist for his outside-centre brother, as a sign of gratitude for providing a hard-knocks education all those years ago. Whether it was in the back garden or indoors, Ken learned the hard way by providing target practice for George and Tusi. 'When we were younger we used to play rugby in the lounge, on our knees,' said George. 'We'd get Kenny to run a straight (line) so we could practise our tackling! My older brother was probably 12, I was eight at the time, so Kenny would have been four or five! We always picked on the little guy!' Ken added: 'I was the tackle dummy for the other two!' The pair of them were highly amused by the memory. In fact, they are highly amused a lot of the time. They are smilers with a lethal streak on the field; mixing defensive solidity, slick ball skills and predatory running with an eye for the line. First George, then Kenny, established themselves at Northampton and they've gone from strength to strength. These days, they're team-mates – a situation they relish – but for a time back in New Zealand, they were opponents; which was equally enjoyable, it seems. Billy and Mako Vunipola have spoken of how difficult they found it to tackle each other in matches, but the same can't be said for the Pisi boys. 'We were playing together for North Harbour, but then I went down to Taranaki and Kenny had another two years at North Harbour,' said George. 'We played against each other a few times. We always wanted to smash each! It was extra special! England forwards Mako Vunipola (left) and Billy Vunipola are brothers and play together at Saracens . Ken Pisi (left) and George Pisi work in tandem in the Northampton Saints backline . Lions and England duo Ben Youngs (left) and Tom Youngs play together at Leicester Tigers . 'It was all about brotherly love – a lot of love went into those tackles! I would say, ""You're a good little player, but I'm still your older brother!"". Ken echoed the sentiment, saying: 'On the field, it's a different story; you just want to give it to him! It's all about respect.' It is respect, Polynesian style. George was born in Apia, capital of Samoa – as was Tusi, who now plays in Japan – while Ken was born in Auckland after the family had relocated to New Zealand for a better life. Both men have come to be adored in the East Midlands, but now they are gearing up to make trouble for many of their English colleagues. Samoa come to Twickenham on November 22 as a gloriously rising force, if a somewhat disorganised one. They are awash with wonderfully gifted players but tend to be undermined by financial difficulty and administrative chaos. That hasn't stopped George warning several club-mates to expect trouble ahead though. 'I've been giving them a lot of banter,' he joked. 'I'm saying, ""You better watch out because the blue army is coming!"". They will be s****ing themselves about seeing a few flying Samoans coming their way! It's an exciting opportunity for us.' Never before have all three players represented their Pacific-island nation together. Tusi and George are well established in the side, whereas Ken has made just three appearances, two off the bench. But armed with Mallinder's endorsement, he is determined to become a regular fixture in a key year leading up to the World Cup, via an historic first home encounter with the All Blacks. Ireland full-back Luke Fitzgerald breaks away from Samoa's George Pisi at the Aviva Stadium in 2010 . Scrum-half Kahn Fotuali'i is another Samoan player at Northampton Saints . 'It will bring the country to a halt. Everyone will be at the game,' he said of the match, to be played in Apia on July 8 next year. Addressing his own hopes, Ken added: 'I see it as a priority this autumn; to play well and try to establish myself in that team, so that next year hopefully I will be at the World Cup. I will play my heart out to do that.' On Saturday, the brothers will play their hearts out in Paris, in a back line featuring a third Samoan, Kahn Fotuali'i, at scrum-half. George recognises the need for Northampton to start their campaign with a bang. 'This first hurdle is so important,' he said. 'We went away to Castres last year and lost. If we can beat Racing away, it should set us up. We want to be one of the best clubs in Europe.' For now, that is the immediate objective, then the Pisis will set out to terrorise Twickenham.","Northampton duo George Pisi and Ken Pisi have been two of the standout performers in the opening rounds of the Aviva Premiership .

"New dad Danny Care dedicated his match-winning try to his new son Blake as Conor O’Shea’s men began their European campaign with a comprehensive win at the Twickenham Stoop. Nick Evans produced a faultless kicking display and set up Care’s second-half try in a game that struggled to catch fire but was lit up briefly by the Harlequins half-backs’ second-half combination play. With Castres’ defence charging up, former All Black fly-half Evans chipped deftly over the top before gathering his own kick and grubbering the ball through for Care to chase. The England scrum-half, who is expected to start across the road against the All Blacks on November 8, showed he still possesses electric pace to outstrip the Castres defence before gathering and touching down. Danny Care of Harlequins dives over for the only try at the Twickenham Stoop on Friday night . Harlequins full back Mike Brown (left) is tackled by Castres winger Max Evans (right) Care, whose partner Jodie gave birth to the couple’s first child a week ago, celebrated in style by rocking his arms in cradle fashion in dedication to his new son as O’Shea’s men delivered an all-important Pool 2 win. ‘I presume the baby celebration came out in force,’ said O’Shea after the game. ‘I went up to Danny before the game and asked him if he was going to do what Romario did for Brazil during a World Cup when he celebrated in style. He duly delivered. I was delighted for Danny. He’s had a few sleepless nights but he’s loving every minute.’ At 34, Evans is entering the twilight of his career. But he combined brilliantly with Care and kicked seven from seven attempts for a personal haul of 20 points. He went past 400 European points for Quins in the process, while his 66th-minute double kick for Care was a rare moment of brilliance in an otherwise attritional game. ‘Our accuracy has been a big thing for us and something we’ve worked really hard on,’ said an elated Care. ‘We knew if we kept hold of the ball we could give anyone a game and that happened tonight. We’ve come out of it with four points and we’re very happy. ‘Nick Evans is pretty mature these days. He’s a wonderful player, one of the best I’ve ever played with. We’re lucky to have him in our side.’ William Whetton of Castres is tackled by Mike Brown in the opening Champions Cup fixture . Former England and Harlequins No 8 Nick Easter charges at the Castres defence . O’Shea went into the game admitting his side’s Aviva Premiership form — they lie seventh with three wins from six matches — has been below par this season. But he was delighted with this gutsy display. ‘We’re really happy,’ he said. ‘We had 77 per cent possession in the first half. Our set-piece was outstanding. It’s a building block, a start. They are a good, physical side and we’re delighted to take four points to none. When you haven’t had a start to the season you’d like, you need guys to put their hand up. That’s what happened.’ Friday night’s display was still nowhere near as fluent as Quins would have liked but the West London outfit will take enormous confidence from a highly professional performance against a typically physical French side. Castres’ South Africa-born scrum-half Rory Kockoff, who qualifies for France next week, kicked all his side’s points but was unable to inspire them to victory as Quins squeezed the life out of them with some intelligent kicking. ‘They just played a simpler game,’ said Kockoff. ‘They put a lot of pressure on us and I don’t think we took the right choices in trying to transfer that pressure. They deserved the win.’ Chris Robshaw gave a typically workmanlike display on one Quins flank while Luke Wallace was named man of the match on the other. O’Shea’s men still gave away too many penalties, but the win gives their campaign lift-off. Jannie Bornman of Castres beats Quins second row Charlie Matthews in the lineout . England captain Chris Robshaw tries to out-muscle the Castres back-row in the second half . Quins fans will also be hugely encouraged by the display of centre George Lowe, who produced a more than tidy performance on his return to action more than a year after a serious neck injury. ‘It’s incredible,’ O’Shea added. ‘To be out for 14 months with a career-threatening injury and to get through like that was superb. He epitomises what you need to make it in professional sport.’ Quins will take three days off before returning on Tuesday to prepare for next Sunday’s clash with Pool 2 rivals Wasps at Adams Park.","England scrum-half scored the only try of the night for Harlequins .

"St Leger winner Kingston Hill has joined the list of notable absentees from Champions Day at Ascot on Saturday after trainer Roger Varian announced the grey would not run again this season. Kingston Hill, fourth to Treve in the Arc, had been a possible for the Champion Stakes. But Varian said: 'Kingston Hill will not run again this season.

Kingston Hill joins John Gosden's top-miler Kingman and Aidan O'Brien's dual Derby-winner Australia in missing the end-of-season finale. On Saturday, the last-named was retired after a hoof problem which surfaced last week meant he could not be prepared for what was intended to be his final race.

"Former Australia coach Robbie Deans once described Adam Ashley-Cooper as the glue that held the Wallabies together and rarely has the versatile back's ability to bring coherence to the side been needed more than in his 100th test. And the 30-year-old celebrated his upcoming century of caps by dressing as a cricketer for a team photo.

If the Wallabies respond at Lang Park with the sort of backs-to-the-wall performance that the more optimistic Australians are hoping for, you can be sure Ashley-Cooper will be at the heart of it. The 30-year-old has mostly taken a back seat to more spotlight-hungry team mates in the nine years since he made his test debut against South Africa in extraordinary circumstances in Perth in 2005. While the more vaunted talents have all suffered fluctuations in form or fortune, however, Ashley-Cooper has rarely had a bad game whether at fullback, in the centres or on the wing, where he will start on Saturday.

"The opportunity to win an unprecedented third Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe has inspired owner Sheik Joaan Al Thani to dramatically abandon plans to retire Treve to stud. So certain was it that Treve’s racing career was over that plans to mate her with stallion Dubawi had been announced 48 hours after winning Europe’s most valuable race a week ago. The unexpected news, which came after discussions with Treve’s trainer Criquette Head-Maarek, emerged hours after it had been announced Aidan O’Brien’ s dual Derby winner Australia had been retired, a hoof infection preventing him from bowing out at Champions Day at Ascot on Saturday. Treve will race next season in a bid to win an unprecedented third Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe . The absence of the colt is a major blow to Britain’s end-of-season fixture, which has already lost Kingman, the John Gosden-trained outstanding miler of the season. In contrast, the prospect seeing Treve, the seventh horse to win the Arc twice, as a five-year-old is a major boost to European Flat racing. Harry Herbert, spokesman for Sheik Joaan’s Al Shaqab Racing, said: ‘Sheik Joaan and his family went to see Treve and discussed it with the Head family. ‘The Sheik said to me this is why we are in the game – to try to do these sort of things, to break barriers. ‘He wants to give her a chance to write her name in the history books and be trained specifically to try to win a third Arc. ‘It will also allow fans, which she has in Qatar and around world, to enjoy her for another season. ‘The welfare of the filly obviously comes first but she is sound and well.’ Treve was set to retire after winning Europe's premier race for a second time last Sunday . Herbert confirmed that veteran French jockey Thierry Jarnet will retain the mount on Treve, leaving Sheik Joaan’s retained jockey Frankie Dettori once again a frustrated observer. Jarnet was on board Treve for the 2013 Arc after Dettori broke his ankle and controversially re-called for this year’s race at the request of Head-Maarek after Dettori had been on board for her three defeats. A campaign of possibly no more than three races could be on the agenda in 2015 for Treve, whose two-length victory last week was as unexpected as it was extraordinary. She was allowed to start at 11-1 after a campaign hindered by back and hoof problems. Treve (centre) was expected to become a broodmare after her second victory at Longchamp . William Hill make her 4-1 to land a third Arc and Herbert added: ‘She is unlikely to run until the end of June or July and have a programme which could possibly take in a race like the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud, the Prix Vermeille and the Arc – little more than that. ‘Criquette is very excited – she knows it is possible Treve could win a third Arc. She has not got a zillion miles on the clock, she is fairly lightly raced (with nine runs).’ Neither is Australia. He heads to his owners’ Coolmore Stud having raced only eight times, winning five and just over £2million. When O’Brien claimed in the aftermath of the chestnut colt’s 2,000 Guineas third that Australia was the best he had ever trained, it both raised expectations and eyebrows. Subsequent wins both the Investec Derby at Epsom, the Irish Derby at the Curragh and the International Stakes at York – all Group Ones – went some way to justifying that comment. Jockey Thierry Jarnet celebrates his winning ride on Treve at Longchamp . A final second place to The Grey Gatsby in the Irish Champion owed much to the race unfolding as a tactical nightmare for jockey Joseph O’Brien. With his impeccable breeding – his father is super sire Galileo and his dam seven-time Group One winner Ouija Board – Australia was always going to be too valuable a breeding property to be raced on next year. But the fact he disappointingly sidestepped what would have been a tantalising clash with Treve in the Arc and is denied a final race leaves a frustrating feeling of unfinished business. Kevin Buckley, Coolmore’s UK respresentative, said: ‘We were all looking forward to it (going to Ascot), but, as you can appreciate, any type of setback like that jeopardises the training regime.’","Treve will race next season to try and win the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe .

"Alan Pardew says the days of giving sympathy penalties to Papiss Cisse are long gone – and believes the striker is back to his free-scoring best. The Newcastle frontman has a habit of hitting hot streaks in front of goal, evidenced by his four from three this season and 13 in 12 following his arrival on Tyneside in January 2012. But Cisse has also endured some barren spells and skied a penalty given to him by his team-mates during one such dry run two seasons ago. Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew believes Papiss Cisse is back to his best form - the striker has four goals in three appearances this season . Pardew's side continue their hunt for a first Premier League win as they host Leicester City on Saturday . Cisse skies a penalty in Newcastle's match with Norwich at St James' Park in September 2012 . Pardew, though, is confident that the 29-year-old is ready to resume his goals trail when United – still in the bottom three and without a win this term – entertain Leicester City this afternoon. ‘He is a natural goalscorer, we see that on the training ground,’ said the Magpies boss. ‘There have been times when it hasn't been so natural for him. With all goalscorers they go through those periods, but certainly at the moment he has looked very sharp in training. ‘When goalscorers get their tails up, they have an unbelievable knack of finding a goal. ‘The first goal at Swansea (2-2 draw earlier this month), I don’t think there is anyone else on our staff who could have scored that goal, and that is what I mean by finding a technique that gets you a goal. Pardew congratulates Cisse after taking him off in the 2-2 draw at Swansea City earlier this month . Cisse scores Newcastle's second goal in the draw at the Liberty Stadium on October 4 . ‘He does that on the training ground on a more regular basis when he is in form, like now, than he did in that period (when team-mates gave him the penalty).’ Cisse – who scored both goals to rescue a point at Swansea - has been away on international duty with Senegal for the past fortnight and only returned to training yesterday. Pardew, though, has no hesitation about starting him against Nigel Pearson’s side. ‘I don't think it's a risk to play him,’ he said. ‘I think he is injury-free for the first time in a long time, because at the back end of last year he was carrying knocks and fatigue a little bit. ‘He is more enthused this year than I have seen him for a long time, and that's being reflected in his goals.’ Pardew issues instructions during a training session this week as Newcastle prepare for the Leicester match . Pardew, meanwhile, admits his players need the home fans on side as they bid to avoid becoming the first United team to go eight matches without a win from the start of a Premier League campaign. ‘It is such an important game for us and for everybody at this football club,’ he added. ‘I hope it is an atmosphere that gives the players the chance to win this game. I can’t tell you how committed we are to try and get the win for them.’","Alan Pardew believes Papiss Cisse is back to his free-scoring best .

"Stoke captain Ryan Shawcross is adamant he will not let constantly being snubbed by England get him down or change his mind about the prospect of playing for Wales instead. Shawcross, who won his solitary senior Three Lions cap as a substitute in a friendly in 2012, once again missed out on selection for the current round of internationals.

Regarding his ongoing battle to get back into the England team, he told The Sentinel: 'It's up to the manager to pick me and if he doesn't I've just got to carry on playing well for Stoke. 'I made a decision a couple of years ago to play for England. I've got one cap and I want more. If it happens, it happens.

Ben Gibson 5.5 - Caught out on a couple of occasions in the opening period and didn't look comfortable when up against the skilful Alen Halilovic. Won a few important headers inside his own box. Luke Shaw 6 - Not as involved in England's attacking play as he would of liked. Attempted to get forward but his crossing was poor. Dealt with his few defensive duties well. Will Hughes 7 - Appeared to be carrying a slight injury in the first half but managed to battle through. Not at his creative best but popped up with a classy finish to put England 2-1 ahead. Booked for pulling back Halilovic. Derby midfielder Will Hughes (second from right) brings the ball forward with a driving run . Hughes celebrates his winning goal with team-mate Harry Kane late in the second half . Jake Forster-Caskey 5.5 - Struggled to really impose himself on the game and was guilty of giving the ball away inside his own half a couple of times after the break.

"A breakthrough in technology could see breathalysers being used at football and rugby matches to stop sportsmen and women from playing on with head injuries. Scientists at the University of Birmingham claim to have developed a quick breath test that can detect signs of concussion. Until now, it requires players to have a full medical assessment or brain scan to accurately assess whether someone had concussion. Tottenham keeper Hugo Lloris remained on the pitch last season after being knocked out for almost a minute . The Mail on Sunday launched the concussion campaign in September 2013 and has already had a strong impact . But Dr Michael Grey and Professor Tony Belli, from the University of Birmingham, are developing a breath test which they hope will vastly reduce the number of severe head injuries. Their discovery has been shown to work in the laboratory and is to undergo wider tests on athletes. Dr Grey said: ‘It is really important that we protect players from themselves. ‘We are talking about someone with mild brain injury when we are looking at concussion. They are not in a position to decide whether they are fit to play.’ The scientists have discovered three chemicals which are released into the bloodstream when the brain receives an injury. The molecules make their way into the lungs and a trace can be detected in the breath. It's been a long time coming but British sports associations are finally taking the issue of concussion seriously . Sporting bodies are under pressure to deal with the problem after several high-profile cases. Last year an inquest heard that Ben Robinson died after twice suffering head injuries during a school rugby match in 2011. The 14-year-old collapsed on the pitch at Carrickfergus in Northern Ireland and died in hospital. The Football Association is also under pressure to act, after Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris remained on the pitch last year after being knocked out for almost a minute. Lloris and his then manager Andrew Villas-Boas decided he was fit to continue playing - despite the advice of the team’s medical staff. Cristoph Kramer was allowed to play on after concussion in the World Cup final but doesn't remember playing . Lloris said later: ‘When you are on the pitch you don’t want to leave the pitch, you want to stay with your team-mates and help them get the best result.’ Another, tragic, example is former England and West Bromwich Albion striker Jeff Astle, who died at the age of 59 with severe brain damage. Astle’s inquest found that his neurological disorder was caused by the repeated impact of heading footballs, which had caused a problem usually only seen in professional boxers. The International Rugby Board recently trialled a pitch side concussion assessment comprised of psychological questions to see whether players are fit to carry on. Dr Grey added: ‘If you send them back on to the pitch you are potentially putting them at risk. That test is not good enough to make that decision.’ The scientists have discovered three chemicals which are released into the blood stream when the brain receives an injury. The molecules make their way into the lungs and a trace can be detected in the breath. Professor Belli said: ‘The chemicals are released within minutes.’ The scientists have also developed a secondary test which uses a portable machine that sends magnetic pulses into the brain to assess brain damage. Schoolboy Ben Robinson (left) tragically died after twice suffering head injuries during a school rugby match  at Carrickfergus in Northern Ireland in 2011, while striker Jeff Astle (right) died aged 59 with severe brain damage . The machine, which uses technology called trans-cranial magnetic stimulation, could be kept in treatment rooms at sports venues to give a better assessment of problems if the breath test highlights any problems. Jeff Astle’s daughter Dawn, 46, is calling for the FA to support further research into the impact of footballing head injuries. She told the British Science Festival in Birmingham: ‘If players today had seen my dad in the four years he was ill, if they had seen him die, they would never head a ball again. It is a matter of life and death, it really is.’ Last month, a group of parents in the US filed a lawsuit against FIFA which pushes for rule changes around the return to play following a concussion. They have also called for limits on how many times children under 17 can head the ball. Dr Grey said: ‘Children’s brains are not fully formed, they are not as well protected as an adult and we do not fully understand the damage these repeated blows to the head are doing to these children’s brains. ‘May be the day will come when we do need an outright ban on heading balls for children of a certain age.’ Since the HIA (Head Injury Assessment) or PSCA (Pitch Side Concussion Assessment) was introduced the number of players continuing on with later-diagnosed concussion has fallen from 56 per cent to 12 per cent.","Breathalysers could be used at sports matches thanks to new technology .

The 37-year-old told The Independent: ‘If you see the talent Ozil and Gotze have, they both need their space. For good players there is always space in the team but they both like to play in the middle, behind the strikers. ‘In the past they didn’t really play together, or one played on the wing. Low chooses sometimes to play Gotze as a striker, which I think is not his best position and he can’t perform as well there compared to when he plays as a No 10. ‘It’s a big decision for the coach, especially now with just one striker going in the squad (Miroslav Klose), it looks like one of the two – maybe Gotze – will be playing up front.

"Chris Lilley's titular character in Jonah From Tonga has been branded 'racist' and 'creepy' by members of Australia's Tongan community, as backlash continues to mount against the comedian's controversial new TV series. Jonah, who featured in Lilley's previous series Summer Heights High, is portrayed with brown face make-up, an over-the-top Polynesian accent and contempt for school authority figures - breeding the catch phrase: 'P**k you, Miss!'. But not everyone is a fan of the boisterous Tongan teenager's depiction in Jonah from Tonga - a co-production between the ABC, BBC and US cable network HBO - with a new a social media campaign hitting back at the stereotypes of the Pacific Island character. However the ABC has played down the furore over the character, which it says makes 'an observation about the narrow-minded attitudes' expressed by some of the show's characters. Scroll down for video . Hitting back at the negative stereotypes: A young Tongan-Australian woman has launched a social media campaign, calling-out Chris Lilley's racist depiction of her community in Jonah From Tonga . Taking to Facebook and Instagram, two young Tongan women have photographed themselves with protest signs. 'This post is to Stand up to the stereotypes of how Pacific Islanders are being perceived as within the TV show #JonahFromTonga,' Leitu Havea wrote on Facebook. On the sign, she notes that she is a proud Tongan, has never been imprisoned, was never suspended from school and is currently studying at university. At the time of publication, the post had been liked by 594 people. 'AMEN!! Absolutely disgusted by this show. Feel confident in knowing that you are not alone in knowing how inaccurate and inappropriate stereotyping in the media is,' commented one of Leitu's friends. #ChangeStartsHere: Sydney university student Leitu Havea is calling for an end to the negative depictions of her community in the name of comedy . Leitu is not alone in calling out the television series, and it's creator, as racist. Prinnie Stevens - a former contestant on The Voice Australia and proud Polynesian herself - has applauded the #ProudPoly movement. 'I have always despised the stereotypes that society put upon us as Tongans/Polynesian people,' she posted to Facebook. Similarly, SBS radio presenter Meliame Fifita took issue with the show following it's premiere, saying it was misrepresenting Tongans. #ChangeStartsWithMe: Salote Tuakalau has joined the campaign to declare Jonah From Tonga as racist . Speaking with the Australia Network last week, Professor Helen Lee, head of La Trobe University's department of sociology and anthropology, labelled the show 'just awful'. 'A 40-year-old white man, dressing up as a 14-year-old Tongan boy in brown face is just inherently creepy,' she said. 'It just seems like a deeply self-indulgent exercise where he just enjoys inhabiting these characters' 'I don't think it's permissible,' she claimed, 'I think it's appalling and I don't think he should be allowed to do it.' Not happy: Australia's Pacific Islander community are unhappy with Chris Lilley's 'satirical' representation of them . It appears as if audiences are beginning to tire of Chris Lilley's negative stereotypical depictions as well. Only 287,000 Australians tuned in to watch Jonah From Tonga on Wednesday night, down from 414,000 last week and a far cry from the 1.6 million viewers Summer Heights High had for it's series premiere. Do you think Jonah From Tonga is racist? 'Jonah from Tonga plays with stereotypes, but it’s doing so to make an observation about the narrow-minded attitudes expressed by some of its characters, including Jonah’s own,' Rick Kalowski, Head of Comedy at ABC TV, said. 'It’s also worth noting that while Jonah himself might be a heightened comic character, virtually every other Tongan or Islander character in the series is presented as a well-rounded, believable person without comic traits'. Chris Lilley has been contacted for comment. We Can Be... Offensive: Chris Lilley's imitations of Asian-Australian physics student by day, turned musical theatre nerd by night, Ricky Wong, and snobby private school girl Ja'ime King - who both featured on his first comedy We Can Be Heroes - didn't come without controversy . Flamboyantly cringeworthy: Summer Heights High's Mr G had plenty of people calling the ABC's complaints line with the musical he wrote about a girl who died of a drug overdose, and while Jonah is Lilley's first brown face, S.Mouse had Lilley donning the even more offensive black face in 2011's Angry Boys .","Tongans take to social media to criticise poor depiction of their community .

Clearing out the garage the other day, I found a pair of my dad’s old boots. It’s a wonder players from the 50s could run at all! Metal toecaps, studs banged in the bottom with the nails coming through the sole. How could you have had any feel for a football with a set of those on? I’d love to organise a game one day. Get 22 top players together, the stars of the Premier League, put them in the old equipment and see how they coped. Now that would be interesting. In the Fifties, there were two kinds of surface, rock hard or mud heap. So it was unbelievable, really, to show the skill that the Tottenham team demonstrated in that gear. Tottenham were superb in the Fifties, especially on the surface... I'd like to see Premier League players try!

Spurs were a 'push and run' team, I would compare them to the modern Barcelona . They were the ‘push and run’ team. It is hard to explain their significance to a younger generation, but I would compare them to the modern Barcelona, the way their game was all about short passing and movement. It wasn’t quite as sophisticated, obviously. What they called push and run back then is now known as the one-two and every team does it. But at the time it was revolutionary. My dad, also called Harry, loved Arsenal, but football wasn’t as tribal then as it is now, so Highbury wasn’t our only destination. Millwall’s ground, The Den, was another haunt, and coming from East London we would wait at the entrance of the Rotherhithe Tunnel for a lift across the river. Eventually a car would stop and we’d jump in. In those days, people were friendlier and more trusting. They were going to football, we were going to football, so we all went together. Highbury and The Den (pictured) were the normal grounds for me as a youngster . An Arsenal vs Manchester United programme, 1958 - the Busby Babes last ever game . Few people wore colours in those days. I remember my mum knitted me a red and white scarf for when I went to Arsenal, but there were no replica shirts or club merchandise. My dad even used to put on a collar and tie to go to some games. I saw the last game the Busby Babes played in this country, a 5–4 win at Arsenal on February 1, 1958, and that would have stuck in my mind even without Munich. It was a fantastic game, such incredible quality, and the next I heard was a radio bulletin saying Manchester United’s plane had crashed on the way back from Belgrade. Mum always had the radio on: The Billy Cotton Band Show, The Archers and the news, and that’s where I heard about Manchester United and Duncan Edwards. I’d kept a scrapbook and I’m sure there is a picture from a newspaper in it of Duncan sitting up in his hospital bed: he was going to be all right. Sadly, his condition worsened and he died. I was devastated. He was my idol. By the time I was 11, I was being scouted by professional clubs, so we used to get offered a lot of tickets. Then we could take our pick of matches. Top of the pile for my dad was when Tom Finney was in town, playing for Preston. In one game Tom played for England, Portugal captain Alvaro Cardoso walked off the field and demanded to be replaced because he was so tired of being given the run-around. England won 10–0.

Pies in the canteen and throwing teacups at players... the Premier League killed all that! Sportsmail's Head of Sport Lee Clayton interviews Redknapp about his new book . The England and Manchester United man died along with many team-mates in the Munich air disaster, 1958 . Another stand-out player was goalkeeper Bert Trautmann, who perhaps is the best example of how the game has changed. He was the first foreign star in English football, who came here as a German prisoner of war, and stayed. I’m not sure that could happen now. I think it would be too horrible for him. He’d been a member of the Hitler youth, a Luftwaffe paratrooper, and had fought on the Eastern front in Russia. He was captured and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp in Lancashire, and when the war was over he ended up playing for St Helens Town in the Lancashire Combination. When Frank Swift, who was Manchester City’s goalkeeper, contracted TB and they went in for Trautmann, there were huge protests at first, particularly among the Jewish community, until the chief rabbi of Manchester came out in his defence. Bert Trautmann was another stand-out player, and is a great example of how the game has changed . He came to England as a German prisoner of war, soon after he won the Footballer of the Year award . He was exotic, he was different. The media wasn’t as sensationalist back then, but we all knew his background, all knew whose side he was on in the war. I suppose it is testament to what he was like as a player and a person that he won over the crowds. In 1956 he was the first foreign player to win the Footballer of the Year Award — it was the year he won the FA Cup, playing with a broken neck. I just look at where he came from and think: ‘If we all ended up liking a bloke who had fought for the Nazis, he must have been good.’ The front cover of Redknapp's new book, A Man Walks On To a Pitch, which is released on Thursday .

"For 50 years, Harry Redknapp has been one of football’s most colourful and outspoken characters. Now he’s written a book every fan will want to read. In his new book 'A Man Walks On To a Pitch' - serialised exclusively by Sportsmail this week - Redknapp reveals the ways in which Arsene Wenger introduced new coaching techniques into the Premier League. The arrival of Arsene Wenger in 1996 certainly heralded a change in English football. He was very successful very quickly, and suddenly all the talk was about his revolutionary new training methods. He only trains for an hour… does everything on the stopwatch… the players are wearing heart monitors at training… he gives them supplements… Prozone is one of the biggest changes. Last season, when QPR were due to play Blackpool, our most recent scout’s report had them operating with four at the back and two holding midfield players.

Now we’ve got machines that can call up game after game, personnel, the most detailed statistics, changes in the gameplan. So we knew that for most of the season they had played three centre-halves, and pushed the full-backs on and that would be how they intended to play if everyone was fit. The aids for a manager are incredible now. When I began, we might have one report on the opposition. That aside, you just played - sorted your own team out and went from there. If they had a player you fancied was good you might tell one of the lads to watch him, give him an idea of what to expect - but there was no detail. Don Revie at Leeds United was the only one who went into depth, and his dossiers were the talk of football.

Other managers were still not convinced they were a good idea. Play your own game, that was the mantra. No managers changed their team to accommodate the opposition. Nobody mirrored formations. These days, if the England manager is caught out tactically he gets slaughtered; but, even a few years before the Premier League, if the same man came in and said the other team were using wing-backs so he would go with a back three too, and flood midfield, he would have been called a coward. Why are we worrying about them? We’re England - let them worry about us! I must admit, I find the point of Prozone baffling at times. Yes, you’ve got it - but so has the team you are playing. So while you’re watching them, they’re watching you, and while you’re changing to deal with them, they’re doing the same. We all go along with it, but where’s the edge?

"For 50 years, Harry Redknapp has been one of football’s most colourful and outspoken characters. Now he’s written a book every fan will want to read. In Redknapp’s new book 'A Man Walks On To a Pitch' – serialised exclusively by Sportsmail this week - the QPR manager reveals his thoughts about the maverick talent of midfielder Ravel Morrison. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ravel Morrison score a brilliant back heel volley during training . Sir Alex Ferguson has likened Ravel Morrison (right) to Manchester United legend Paul Scholes in the past . The 21-year-old midfielder sparkled at the beginning of last season for West Ham . Morrison (right) played under Harry Redknapp last season while on loan at QPR in the Championship . Age: 21 . Born: Wythenshawe, Manchester . Position: Midfielder . Clubs: Manchester United (2010-12), West Ham United (2012-), Birmingham City (loan, 2012-13), Queens Park Rangers (loan, 2014), Cardiff City (loan, 2014-) Career appearances: 70 . Career goals: 14 . I had Ravel Morrison at QPR last season. Sir Alex Ferguson said he was the most naturally gifted player he had seen at Manchester United since Paul Scholes - and then sold him because he could do nothing with him. He’d been at West Ham, scored one of the goals of the season against Tottenham but they, too, found it hard to control him. He’d already had one loan spell at Birmingham City, but ended up with me. The kid can really play. He goes past people and makes them look silly. He’s like the strolling England player Alan Hudson in the 1970s. He doesn’t run, he glides. Redknapp has compared Morrison's ability to former England star Alan Hudson's (centre) in the 1970's . Morrison (left) is currently out on loan at Championship side Cardiff City . Scholes, Gerrard and Ferdinand make Redknapp's modern era Premier League XI . Giggs would have solved England's problems... he was born to play left wing .

Vieira and Keane are warriors... they were even prepared to do battle while working on TV! Why Redknapp fears that the English manager is in danger of becoming extinct . Vieira nearly crossed North London to join Spurs... and  Suarez was close to signing too . Pies in the canteen and throwing teacups at players... the Premier League killed all that! Sportsmail's Head of Sport Lee Clayton interviews Redknapp about his new book . Redknapp's new book is available to buy on Thursday and is priced at £16 until October 21 . By the time we came to the end of the season, though, he couldn’t get in our starting line-up. There was one game last season when we’d lost confidence and were losing. I asked him to change his position, to play on the left. His face fell into a petulant pout. ‘I pulled him away from the rest, took him outside and explained as patiently as the time allowed. ‘Ravel, we are losing the f****** game,’ I said. ‘I just want you to play there and do a job for the team. We have to win the game. It’s not about you, OK? It’s about the team. ‘People look at your face in there when I’ve asked you to do something, and they will all go away and think you are a big-headed bastard, because your attitude stinks. That’s what people say about you.’ Second half he was absolutely different class. He ran the game, everything good we did came from him and we were all watching it thinking, ‘‘What a talent’’. You looked at that performance and thought he could get us promoted on his own if he put his mind to it. It was like watching a player with Gareth Bale’s class in the Championship. Lee Clark, the Birmingham City manager, said to Ravel that he was the best player since Gazza. His response: ‘Who’s Gazza?’ Should that surprise us? Admittedly that World Cup in Italy is 24 years ago now, and Ravel is 21, but however long ago it was I think he can be expected to know who Paul Gascoigne is. But it does show you that when you’ve gone, when you’ve had your day, nobody cares. If Morrison had played consistently at his best, he might have gone to the World Cup; on his bad days you wouldn’t have put him in our reserve team. February 2011 . Ravel Morrison receives a 12-month referral order after admitting to threatening a mugging victim in order to stop them from giving evidence. May 2011 .

"George Best is still the bravest player I've seen... he changed football . Duncan Edwards was my idol in the fifties... I was devastated after the Munich air disaster . George Best, Bobby Moore and Sir Bobby Charlton all make my team of the sixties . For 50 years, Harry Redknapp has been one of football’s most colourful and outspoken characters. Now he’s written a book every fan will want to read. In Redknapp’s new book 'A Man Walks On To a Pitch' - serialised exclusively by Sportsmail this week - the QPR manager picks his all-time team of the fifties. BILLY WRIGHT . If you look at what he achieved, it seems impossible. He played 70 consecutive games for England, captained them 90 times and won 105 caps — the first player to reach the century in world football, even though he lost seven years of his career to the Second World War. Billy Wright (right) trains with Stanley Matthews (left) and Duncan Edwards at Highbury in 1957 . DUNCAN EDWARDS . Bobby Charlton said watching Duncan made him feel inadequate. He had it all: left foot, right foot, phenomenal balance and poise; he could dribble, he could tackle; there was 14 stone of him, strong as an ox. He made his England debut at 18. They beat Scotland 7-2. Edwards trains at Old Trafford in 1954 after being selected for the England Under 23 team at the age of 17 . Edwards (right) with then Manchester United manager Sir Matt Busby in 1957 . DANNY BLANCHFLOWER . I don’t think British football has ever produced a better thinker. He invented the wall. You know, the wall that every team in the world now puts in front of a free-kick taker? Danny thought of it first, in a game against Italy. Danny told me that the Italians seemed so perplexed — and so was the ref — that when defender Sergio Cervato picked up the ball, moved it five yards wide of the wall, turned round and shot it into the net, a goal was awarded! Danny Blanchflower pictured in 1958 during his time at Tottenham . TOM FINNEY . I’ll lean on my old man here. Dad was Finney-mad. Bill Shankly said he would have been great even playing in an overcoat. Amazingly, he didn’t even begin his professional career until he was 24 because the Second World War intervened. Tom Finney (left) was known for his loyalty to Preston, where he made over 400 appearances . JOHN CHARLES . He may have been the best all-round footballer to have come out of Britain. A monster on the pitch; fearless and strong, a real powerhouse. Nat Lofthouse said he was the best defender he played against and Billy Wright said he was the best striker he ever faced. John Charles pictured scoring for Leeds against Sunderland in 1957 . Tom Finney, Duncan Edwards and Alf Ramsey all make it into Harry Redknapp's team of the fifties . George Best is still the bravest player I've seen... he changed football . Duncan Edwards was my idol in the fifties... I was devastated after the Munich air disaster . George Best, Bobby Moore and Sir Bobby Charlton all make my team of the sixties . Where are poor Paul Gascoigne's friends now he needs their help? Dalglish had West Ham stars standing and applauding at 15... then he signed for Celtic! Alan Hansen reminded me of Bobby Moore, that's why he's in my team of the Eighties . John Robertson, Kevin Keegan and Phil Neal make my team of the Seventies . Giggs would have solved England's problems... he was born to play left wing . Wenger heralded a change... he introduced Prozone and scouting reports to England . Ravel Morrison has the class of Bale but his attitude is holding back his talent .

"CLICK HERE to read our exclusive interview with Harry Redknapp as he opens a treasure trove of wonderful football memories in a new book that celebrates icons of the game. Harry Redknapp has opened a treasure trove of football memories in his new book, 'A Man Walks On To A Pitch,' serialised by Sportsmail this week, and reminisces with Head of Sport Lee Clayton about a life following the game. Here are 10 of the best bits from the interview, which you can read in full here. Harry Redknapp reflects on a lifetime of watching football in his new book, 'A Man Walks Onto a Pitch...', which is being serialised by Sportsmail, and picks his favourite XI from every decade he has enjoyed the game . On the days before wall-to-wall live football on the box... ‘We only saw one game a year on TV – The FA Cup Final. And our telly was a nine-inch black and white. We hung a magnifying glass from the top that made it a twelve inch when you looked through it’. On the tricky task of comparing eras... ‘How can you ask me to choose between the years with Duncan Edwards, Tom Finney and John Charles and the years with Jennings, Souness, Dalglish and Keegan? Or Ronaldo, Bale, Gerrard, Scholes against Vieira and Keane’. On his favourites... ‘Dave Mackay was one of the best I’ve ever seen, Jimmy Greaves was the greatest goal scorer and George Best was just the best. The greatest. He knew players went out onto the pitch to hurt him. They couldn't get near him.’ Tom Finney, seen here playing for Preston North End, was a favourite of the young Harry . Redknapp ranks George Best as the greatest - 'Players couldn't get near him,' he says . On Duncan Edwards... ‘Duncan Edwards… England debut at 18, won 7-2 against Scotland. Died at 21. Tragic. He was buccaneering, like Roy Keane plus Steven Gerrard and maybe a bit more. Defender, midfield, goalscorer, powerhouse, leader, winner. Everything. Such a shame.’ On the modern way of negotiating a new contract... ‘These days the player tells the agent, the agent speaks to the chairman, the player might even speak to the chairman himself. Their attitude towards the manager is “You are only passing through, so why should we bother with you?”’ On what the legendary managers of the past would think of players today... ‘I do wonder how managers like Brian Clough and Bill Shankly would cope. How would Cloughie deal with players taking five pairs of different colour boots to a game? We used to squeeze into a mini bus with two skips. Now you take a small army to an away game.’ Duncan Edwards was one of the best players of his generation but perished in the Munich crash aged just 21 . Brian Clough would not have stood for the antics of today's footballers, says Redknapp . The front cover of Harry's new book . On money in the game today... ‘Yes the game has changed. There is more money, more of everything and manager’s salaries have improved, but I’m not sure how many of the current lot could hold a light to Clough, Shankly, Don Revie, Ron Greenwood. Jose Mourinho? Probably, yeah. Pellegrini won the title, but he won the title because he has got good players and spends good money. How much coaching does Vincent Kompany need?’ On intolerance... ‘Imagine Bert Trautmann playing now. A German, who fought for the Nazis, in goal in this league. People would spit on him, abuse him, terrorise him. There is so much hatred now.’ On retirement... ‘What else would I do (apart from manage)? I play a bit of golf. I’m useless around the house. I don’t have any hobbies. I just love the game. You get older quicker without it and, when you win, there is nothing like it.’ On the matchday experience for the fans... ‘The old man would wear a suit and tie (and go to football). There was no aggro, no abuse, no segregation, no bad chants. I couldn’t let my Grandchildren go to Southampton the other week because of the abuse I have to put up with.’ A Man Walks On To A Pitch by Harry Redknapp is published by Ebury Press, priced £20. Offer price £16 until October 21.

"Northern Ireland captain Steven Davis will attempt to steer clear of the growing expectation surrounding the side following their flawless start to Euro 2016 qualifying. A clinical 2-0 away win over Group F's faltering favourites Greece on Tuesday made it three wins in three for Michael O'Neill's men, Northern Ireland's best ever start to a World Cup or European campaign. That leaves them top of the standings by two points and in with a wonderful chance of reaching their first major finals in 30 years. Steven Davis (left) says its important Northern Ireland remain focused as they attempt Euro 2016 qualification . But while Southampton midfielder Davis is delighted for the fans back home, who can now start to dream of an unexpected trip to France, he feels it is no bad thing for the squad to get back across the water and away from the excitement. 'I don't think trying to keep our feet on the ground will be much of an issue,' said Davis, whose side came into the group having dropped into seeding pot five. 'It may help that we don't see the hype at home but it is great to have that again. Davis (right) has captained Northern Ireland to three wins out of three in their Euro 2016 qualification group . 'People have optimism but we know there is another tough away game next month in Romania and the most important thing for us is to continue the momentum. 'It's been an unbelievable start for us because I don't think anyone could have foreseen it, especially the way the fixtures came out with two tough away games in Hungary and Greece. 'We are just delighted with the start and we will enjoy it but then it's about concentrating on Romania next month.' Northern Ireland striker Kyle Lafferty has scored in all three of their Euro 2016 qualifiers so far . Davis joined the praise for striker Kyle Lafferty, who maintained his own 100 per cent record of scoring in every game so far. The Norwich man has not always delivered on his promise on the international stage but has shown a new-found maturity this year, with man-of-the-match displays against Hungary, the Faroe Islands and Greece. And Davis is delighted to see his former Rangers team-mate back at his imposing best. 'Big Laff has been excellent. He gives us that outlet and in the first three games he's been outstanding,' he said. Lafferty (right) scored Northern Ireland's second in their 2-0 win in Greece on Tuesday night . 'He's been unbelievable for us but that is the sort of thing we are going to need from him if we are going to be successful. 'It's been an excellent start and I'm sure he will take a lot of confidence from it. 'He really deserves it. He works so hard for the team, even in the past and it's nice to see him getting his rewards.'","Northern Ireland beat Greece 2-0 in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Tuesday .

"Matt Taylor will miss Burnley’s Premier League clash with his old club West Ham at Turf Moor on Saturday after being sent for surgery on an achilles problem. The 32-year-old midfielder left the Hammers on a free transfer in the summer and played in Burnley’s first four games of the season, but has not appeared since the goalless draw with Manchester United in August. The club’s medical staff hoped that rest would cure the condition but manager Sean Dyche revealed that Taylor is booked in for an operation on Monday. Burnley manager Sean Dyche (above) is without midfielder Matt Taylor for the home match against West Ham . Taylor (right) has not featured for Burnley since their 0-0 draw against Manchester United in August . ‘Matty Taylor unfortunately is going to have a minor operation,’ said Dyche. ‘He’s got a niggling achilles and it just hasn’t settled down. ‘We’re not sure how long he will be out for. We’ll know more after the operation but we’re hopeful that he’ll go in Monday. ‘It’s nothing too serious in the grand scheme of things, just something that’s niggling. It’s a small bony area at the back of his achilles which is irritating it, so that’s going to have to be done. ‘I always follow surgical opinion. That was the opinion to allow it time to settle down, but it just hasn’t settled to the level that you need to carry on what you’re doing. So we leave that one with the surgeons, that’s what they’re paid for.’ Burnley striker Danny Ings (left) challenges Branislav Ivanovic (right) of Chelsea for the ball . Kieran Trippier (above) should also return to bolster Burnley's defence . There was better news on the injury front for Dyche regarding five other players, including last season’s 26-goal top scorer Danny Ings who could return to action against West Ham. Ings has missed the last three games with a hamstring strain and Dyche said: ‘He’s had a good week with us so he’s certainly in the thinking which we’re pleased about. ‘He’s managed to get on the grass at the beginning of the week as well which is important because he’s fit to train with the group rather than throw him in at the last minute. We just thought it was important to give him a full week’s training so he definitely comes into the thinking.’ Kieran Trippier is fit despite being carried off with an ankle injury in the 2-2 draw at Leicester last time out, and David Jones, Nathaniel Chalobah and Michael Keane should all be available. The match at Turf Moor comes too soon for forward Sam Vokes, who is recovering from a serious knee injury . However, Sam Vokes is still not ready to return while Steven Reid and Dean Marney are unlikely to be fit to face West Ham. ‘Vokes is going really well,’ added Dyche. ‘There have been some remarks in the papers about him trying to be fit in a month, and I don’t think that’s the case. You never know but he’s going along really well. ‘There will certainly be no pressure from us. We want to make sure he’s right, fit and well in his own time.’","Matt Taylor booked in for Monday op after rest fails to heal the problem .

"A couple who raised eyebrows by spending £500,000 on a rotting cottage with no heating or electricity have proven their doubters wrong - by building an ultra-modern home worth around £1.5million in its place. Alex Michaelis, 49, and Susanna Bell, 43, fell in love with the house in 2009 despite it being overgrown, ramshackle and on a cliff-top which is slowly eroding away. But despite the doubts of council planners - who said they were 'completely mad' - they knocked down the home overlooking Praa Sands near Penzance, Cornwall, and turned it into an ultra-modern holiday let where every major window faces the sea. Ramshackle: Alex Michaelis, 49, and Susanna Bell, 43, fell in love with the original cottage (pictured) despite it having no heating or electricity and rotting away . Ultra-modern: The couple knocked down the home and built a sleek holiday let in its place, where every one of its four bedrooms has a sea view . Relaxing: The home also includes space for a hammock and ping-pong table and is let out during the peak season to holidaymakers for up to £5,000 a week . The couple, from west London, said they almost missed the three-bedroom original cottage on their first viewing because it was so badly concealed by undergrowth. They wanted to revamp the house without demolishing it but were told the task would be almost impossible because so many parts of the house were rotting away. So they set about creating a house reminiscent of the hit TV show Grand Designs, with sleek white walls and wide open spaces. Architect Mr Michaelis ensured all the main rooms of the new house face the sea, including space for a ping pong table and hammock alongside its five bathrooms and four bedrooms, one of which is a bunk bed room big enough for five people. They let out the home to holidaymakers for up to £5,000 a week in peak season and informal estimates have put its value at £1.5million. But their true profit will remain a mystery - as they have kept the cost of demolishing the old house and building its replacement tightly under wraps. Overgrown: The couple said the original house was so consumed by undergrowth that they could not tell where it was on their first viewing in 2009 . Luxury: The true profit to the couple will remain a mystery, as they have declined to say how much the new home reminiscent of Grand Designs cost them . Splashing about: Even the view from the bathroom includes a wide vista of the sea from the Cornish coast. The beach is a few moments' walk away . Modern: The new home is larger than its three-bedroom predecessor, which had not been lived in for some time and parts of which had begun to rot away . Ms Bell, an art consultant, said: 'We were amazed by the uninterrupted sea views and thought the location was amazing - it was magical. 'We just fell in love with it and decided to buy it, but we had no real idea what we were going to do with it. 'The original cottage hadn't been lived in for a while. We bought the house because of the stunning views but the cottage itself was in need of some renovation so we decided to knock it down. 'Because the building was on an eroding coastline, when we went to apply for planning the council said we were completely mad - but we went ahead with it and we are now looking into some coastal defences. 'The ocean is just so beautiful and it's lovely to sit in the main room and look at the stunning view. We have even seen dolphins and basking sharks.' Ms Bell said: 'The ocean is just so beautiful and it's lovely to sit in the main room and look at the stunning view. We have even seen dolphins and basking sharks' Sleepover: One of the rooms has bunk beds and sleeps up to five people - who can even turn their hand to Monopoly if the beach is too windswept . Smart: The kitchen has a wide window facing the sea, as do all of the bedrooms and bathrooms. Ms Bell said: 'Because the building was on an eroding coastline when we went to apply for planning the council said we were completely mad - but we went ahead with it and we are now looking into some coastal defences'","Alex Michaelis and Susanna Bell bought cliff-top home with no heating or electricity near Penzance, Cornwall, in 2009 .

"Eliaquim Mangala has been ruled out of Manchester City’s Premier League clash with Tottenham through injury – but Yaya Toure is in contention to play at the Etihad. Manager Manuel Pellegrini hopes that Mangala, a £32million summer signing from FC Porto, will be fit for Tuesday’s crucial Champions League clash away to CSKA Moscow despite suffering from a thigh problem. He said: ‘There is just a small problem with Mangala. He has a muscle injury, but I think he will be fit without any problems for Tuesday.’ Eliaquim Mangala (left) heads out to training at the Etihad Stadium with team-mate Bacary Sagna . Yaya Toure is in contention for Saturday after returning from international duty with Ivory Coast . Toure flew back immediately after Ivory Coast’s game against DR Congo in midweek in a bid to be ready to face Spurs, and Pellegrini confirmed that the midfielder is in his squad. ‘All the other players are okay,’ added Pellegrini. ‘Of course it’s not easy to see what is the best starting XI for Saturday when you have so many players arriving on different days of the week. Tomorrow we will decide. ‘Yaya arrived yesterday with Aleksandar Kolarov and Matija Nastasic, other players arrived on Wednesday and some more on Tuesday, so we’re trying to see which is the best team for tomorrow – but all of them are on the squad list.’ The issue of Toure and the Premier League’s other African players returning from West Africa has raised concerns over the Ebola outbreak, and even put the January’s African Cup of Nations in jeopardy. Pellegrini said: ‘I suppose that the people who have to decide about that have enough experience to know if they can play or not play. For me it is very difficult to give my opinion but I trust in the persons who have to decide if they can do it or not.’ Meanwhile Kolarov and Nastasic were caught up in the politically-fuelled brawl that halted Serbia’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Albania in Belgrade. City head for Eastern Europe to play Moscow next week but the match will be played behind closed doors after UEFA punished the Russian club over the behaviour of their fans. James Milner, Fernandinho, Sergio Aguero and Aleksandar Kolarov were all in action on Friday . Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany rests his hand on team-mate Sagna during training . ‘I think that affects football,’ said Pellegrini. ‘I don’t think it is the best way to play, not only for our team but for Russian team. For fans, I think football is with fans. It is the most important thing because they give an atmosphere at the stadium which is different to an empty stadium. It will be a different experience but that cannot affect our performance.’ The City boss admitted that the Premier League champions are entering a crucial phase of their season. They must beat Moscow home and away to have a realistic chance of qualifying for the Champions League knockout stage, and defend the Capital One Cup against Newcastle, but Pellegrini is trying not to look further ahead than Spurs as he looks to keep pace with leaders Chelsea. ‘We are just thinking about the next game which is Tottenham,’ he said. ‘We know that from now until the next international break we have to play seven games in three different competitions. ‘We have four games in the Premier League. It is very important for us to try not to drop points and to try and recover points from Chelsea. Toure in action for Ivory Coast against Youssouf Mulumbu of the Democratic Republic of Congo on Tuesday . Kolarov (right) was in action for Serbia in their troubled tie at home to Albania on Tuesday . ‘We also have one game against Newcastle which is final because if we don’t win we go out of the Capital One Cup. We have two games against CSKA Moscow in the Champions League that we need win to win both of them. 'The best way to think is that the next game is a final, which is Tottenham, we will try to win it and after we will see which is the best team to try and win the next final.’ City hammered Spurs 11-1 on aggregate in the league last season but Pellegrini is expecting a much tougher test on Saturday. ‘I am sure it is a different Tottenham,’ he said. ‘Last year one of the best games that we played was against Tottenham away. Here also we played very well but we are not expecting that we can score six or five goals every time we play Tottenham. ‘They are a very strong team. Mauricio Pochettino is a very good manager. Really we play in our best moment last season. We hope tomorrow we can do a very good game also.’","Defender Mangala ruled out of Tottenham game for Manchester City .

In A Man Walks On To a Pitch, Redknapp reveals his admiration for Ryan Giggs. Ryan Giggs just had an athlete’s physique. He could run all day. The only other player I’ve seen like that was West Ham’s Billy Bonds, who was all ribs. He never blew up in the summer, never put weight on year to year, and that was Giggs, too.

He was muscular, yes, but you’d think a powerful full back would be able to bash him up. They couldn’t. Every Englishman wishes Ryan could have played for us because we had a real problem on the left throughout the 1990s, but his family is all Welsh. He played for England Schoolboys, but the moment it came to senior football he could only represent Wales. It could have solved so many issues had he been able to play for England because we ruined a succession of players out on that left flank: Paul Scholes retired because he kept getting stuck out there; Joe Cole made a decent fist of it for a while; they even tried my lad Jamie out there in one game. It’s a scary position if it is not yours by right because it is so hard to get in the game. Ryan was born there; he had pace, he could cross, come inside or go outside.

"Parents in Newtown, Connecticut, are reportedly being called in one by one to positively identify the bodies of children following Friday's tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Reuters deputy social media editor Matthew Keys tweeted the news on Friday around 11.30pm saying he heard it on WNBC. The bodies of the dead students are still being held inside the school, sources at the scene of the shooting told MailOnline. Scroll down for video . Tragic day: Connecticut State Police Officers stand outside the Sandy Hook Volunteer Fire and Rescue Company near Sandy Hook Elementary School . In mourning: Shocked mourners stand outside a vigil at the Saint Rose of Lima church in Newtown, Connecticut Friday night after a heavily-armed gunman opened fire on school children and staff . Grief: A young woman hugs another person outside of the vigil; 26 people, including 20 young schoolchildren, were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary . Prayers: Mourners pray and stand outside the overflow area of the vigil; the shooting happened only two weeks before Christmas . Residents of the small town Newtown came together this evening to express their grief this evening at a memorial service for the 20 children and six staff members gunned down today at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Approximately 1,000 mothers, fathers, children, and grandparents flocked to St Rose of Lima Catholic church, whose congregation lost six children at the hands of shooter Adam Lanza, 20. Parents held their children close, poignantly carrying them past a candlelit nativity scene as the church was filled to the rafters, with hundreds having to stand in the freezing cold to pay their respects to the tragic dead. Lighting candles: People pray at a makeshift shrine outside of the church . Craig Hoekenen arrived at St Rose of Lima church with his wife Tracy and their nine-year old boy C.J. and seven-year old Matthew who was at Sandy Hook School as the massacre unfolded. Speaking to MailOnline in front of the bright lights and flashing cameras of the world's media, little Matthew described how he had to walk over 'smashed glass and blood' as he was led to safety by policemen who told him to 'close his eyes'. 'We were doing our morning stretches, when we heard guns going off' said second grade student Matthew, who his mother described as 'scared out of his mind' by the traumatic experience. The schoolboy’s mother Tracy said that when she received the phone call informing her that her son's school had gone into lockdown she felt 'unable to breathe.' Those who knew families affected by the tragedy chose not to identify anyone involved, but it is thought that the children killed by Adam Lanza were from kindergarten and first grade. One entire kindergarten class remains unaccounted for. Looking in: As hundreds stand outside St. Rose of Lima Roman Catholic Church, which was filled to capacity, a couple embrace during a healing service held in for victims . Paying respects: Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, left, speaks to mourners at the service this evening . Unspeakable: Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy said that 'evil visited this community today' Serious: Mourners listen to the service with grim, saddened faces . Looking in: A man who did not fit inside the packed church looks in through an open stained-glass window . 'I was working at home when a police officer friend phoned me,' said Billy Alvares, who attended the service with his daughter Cynthia, a third grader at the school. 'Evil visited this community today... each parent, each sibling, each member of the family has to understand that Connecticut - we're all in this together. We'll do whatever we can to overcome this event.' -Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy . ‘He told me that a shooting had occurred at the school and then my phone rang with the automatic lock-down call that parents receive. I can't tell you or describe to you the feeling of knowing that my daughter was in danger and when I was reunited with her I was so shaken up. 'I am fortunate but others are not. Who would ever do such a thing as this?' St Rose of Lima has space for 500 people but the church overfilled as Monsenior Weiss led a congregation including Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy in mourning. 'Evil visited this community today and it's too early to speak of recovery, but each parent, each sibling, each member of the family has to understand that Connecticut,' Malloy said. 'We're all in this together. We'll do whatever we can to overcome this event. ‘We lit 26-candles today to remember the victims of the shooting,' Serif Weiss said after the service.'We say that but we must acknowledge that 28 people died today including the shooter. A lot of parents lost their hearts today but I detected no anger today from them. We must hope a good resolution comes from this.' Remembering: Twenty white balloons have been tied to the sign for the Sandy Hook Elementary School . Grim: Mourners gather inside the St. Rose of Lima Roman Catholic Church . In prayer: Mourners join hands after entering the church . Paul Wishneski, 41, and his wife Mary Kay said that they thanked God that their daughter Emma . Murderer: Adam Lanza, a troubled 20-year-old loner with a history of autistic behavior, is the monster behind a horrific shooting at a Connecticut elementary school that left 26 people, including 20 children, dead . was off school today with a sprained ankle. The eight year-old is in the third grade at sandy hook school and her parents were alerted to the horrific attack unfolding as they received the automated call from the school authorities. ""We went to code red,' we just looked at each other and said 'oh my God'  said Paul. 'We assumed it was the high school that had been attacked but we live down the road from the school and realized it was the kids who were at risk.' 'This is such a close community, I got married at this church, my sister and brother got married at this church.'We know two of the families who lost their son in the attack. We had dinner with them last week.'Their boys were six or seven, it is a tragedy.' Father Petrucci was the chaplain at the Danbury Hospital when three victims of the shooting, one woman and two children arrived. 'The two children sadly died, but I was not involved with them at any point,' said the 65-year-old priest. Lingering: After the vigil, many remained in the church to pray or meditate . 'The woman, who I will not name is doing well, but was shot but not seriously.' As the service ended, the congregation slowly filed out to pray at the feet of a statue of the Virgin Mary outside the church.' Hours after the prayer vigil at St Rose of Lima Church and as midnight approached, dozens of mourners lingered, bowing their heads in silent prayer or staring straight ahead, their eyes welling up with tears. There was complete silence except for the opening and closing of the church doors, as more people found their way in. Some were alone. Others took solace with a spouse, child or parent.","It has been reported that parents in .

"The 'deeply offensive' text messages which led to Kurtley Beale being indefinitely suspended by Australia can be revealed. Beale was suspended after arguing with the team's business manger Di Patston on a flight to South America last month and now the messages which sparked that bust-up have been leaked. A letter sent to Beale by the Australian Rugby Union referenced two messages  containing photographs of 'extremely obese women', one with the message 'Di - who wants a go f***ing this?' The Sunday Telegraph reports. Di Patston (left) was copied into a message sent by Kurtley Beale in June which has led to his suspension . Beale slips as he fails to kick a penalty against the British and Irish Lions in the first Test last June . Beale misses a catch against the  Lions in the first Test in Brisbane . It is alleged that the utility back wanted to send the texts to team-mates but also sent them to Patston in error. Beale faces an disciplinary hearing over the incident this week which is expected to result in the termination of his Australia contract, which in any case is due to expire at the end of the year. Patston quit her role over the incident last Friday and her full exchange with Beale, which happened in June while the team were in a Brisbane hotel before the first Test against France, can also be revealed. According to the The Daily Telegraph, Ms Patston told Beale she couldn't stop crying after receiving the offensive text messages. 'What did I do to you? I have barely known you a day. I can't stop crying I am so humiliated by this,' Ms Patston texted to Beale. 'Don't you think my job is hard enough with this?' Beale replied four minutes later, apologising for the message, telling Ms Patston she has done nothing wrong and that he does 'stupid things for no reason'. PATSTON (1:08pm) 'I am sitting here in the team room doing my job and I can't stop crying. What did I do to you? You have barely known me a day. I can't stop crying I am so humiliated by this. Don't you think my job is hard enough without this? This is how the only female staff member is treated? I am so embarrassed by this I am leaving for my room I can't stop crying thanks a lot.' BEALE (1.12pm) 'We all see how hard you work for us. I just do stupid things for no reason... I hate that I have done this to you & I am so sorry di.' PATSTON (1.15pm) 'Just leave me alone this is not ok. Do you realise the situation you've put me in? I have earned this job and I am proud of being a female and this level. If I complain then I make it hard for women in Rugby and it puts the reputation of the entire squad at stake.' After Kurtley Beale and Di Patston met in a Brisbane hotel room . PATSTON (3.44pm) 'Glad we got the chance to catch up and talk it through. I wanted you to look me in the eyes and realise I am a person - a mum, wife and daughter (all those things we discussed) and how they would feel seeing what you sent me. I'll never know who you sent them to or why; but everyone deserves a chance. You were clearly upset and showed remorse which I am for (sic).' BEALE (3.48pm) 'I can't believe you're not going to tell Ewen or the ARU this means so much to me & I have learned my lesson I promise you. You have been evry kind to me di and I'll never do anything like this again. Seeing you so upset hurt me I couldn't deal with it. You have my respect & deserve better you do so much & work so hard. Wish I could take it back. Thankyou di.' Edited transcripts of text messages . Ms Patston then fired back, telling Beale to leave her alone. 'Do you realise the situation I am in? Just leave me alone please.' After a further apology from Beale, Ms Patston asked whether he was sorry for sending the message - or for being caught. Around two hours after their  exchange began, Ms Patston and Beale met to discuss the matter in a hotel room with three Wallabies players present. Ms Patston forgave Beale, promising to keep the offending texts secret - but swore she would only keep her silence if no other incidents occurred. After they met, she messaged him to assure him the ARU would not find out about the texts. 'I wanted you to look me in the eyes and realise I am a person - a mum, wife and daughter... and how they would feel seeing what you sent me,' Ms Patston wrote to Beale after their meeting. 'I'll never know who you sent them to or why, but everybody deserves a chance.' 'You were clearly upset and showed remorse which I am for (sic).' Beale is currently not available to Ewan McKenzie after being suspended by Australia . The rugby star promised the then-business manager he would 'never do anything like this again.' 'I can't believe you're not going to Ewen (McKenzie, the Australia coach) or the ARU this means so much to me,' he replied. 'I have learned my lesson I promise you.' 'Seeing you so upset hurt me I couldn't deal with it. You have my respect & deserve so much more.' However, Beale broke that promise when he verbally abused Patston on a flight from South Africa to South America last month, leading to Ms Patston's resignation due to stress. The team was flying to Mendoza after their 28-10 loss to the Springboks in Cape Town. Beale is believed to have made a sarcastic comment to Ms Patston when she asked him to change into an item of Wallabies team gear, which sparked a heated exchange. The Integrity Unit announced an investigation into the matter and Beale was not selected to play in the 21-17 defeat by Argentina the following Saturday. Beale was suspended for Australia's 21-17 defeat by Agentina last Saturday . Argentina's players celebrate their 21-17 victory over Australia in the Rugby Championship . After Beale's second offence, Ms Patston is understood to have notified McKenzie and ARU officials about the offending texts Beale had sent four months earlier. Beale's playing future is now in doubt, as he prepares to face two separate code of conduct hearings. The first hearing will take place early this week and exclusively address the text messages. It's expected to end with Beale's contract be terminated. Wallabies captain Michael Hooper came out in Beale's defence on Sunday, saying the 25-year-old does not deserve to be sacked. 'I hope KB stays in rugby union and Australian Rugby Union,' said Hooper. 'We are backing Kurtley.I enjoy having him around the team and he is quality on the field.'","Crude text messages sent by Beale to Di Patston can be revealed .

"New Ferrari chairman Sergio Marchionne claims the marque is ready to 'kick some ass' and take risks in order to return to the front in Formula One. In taking over from former chairman Luca Di Montezemolo this week, Marchionne has come out all guns blazing and made clear Ferrari's continued lack of success is unacceptable. The current campaign is the sixth in succession for Ferrari without a trophy to show for their efforts and considerable spend. Kimi Raikkonen races for Ferrari in Russia, the Italian team have been starved of success for six years . New Ferrari chief Sergio Marchionne (L) is determined to do what it takes to return the team to former glories . The day after Di Montezemolo confirmed star driver Fernando Alonso would be leaving Ferrari at the end of this season, Marchionne is ready to get tough. 'We've got to kick some ass and we've got to do it quickly,' said Marchionne, speaking to Autocar. 'It takes what it takes. We might screw up, but we've got nothing to lose, right? Let's risk something.' It was Ferrari's abysmal performance in the Italian Grand Prix at Monza in early September that brought the team's situation home to roost for Marchionne. Fernando Alonso has confirmed that he will be leave the marque at the end of the season . 'I keep getting reminded racing is not a science, that a number of factors influence performance,' said Marchionne. 'And then I go to Monza and see the first six cars are not Ferrari or powered by a Ferrari engine, and my blood pressure just popped. 'A non-winning Ferrari on the Formula One track is not Ferrari. I can live with periods of bad luck, but it cannot become a structural element of the brand.'","Sergio Marchionne replaced Luca Di Montezemolo as chairman of the team .

"There's no getting around it, summer is coming to a close and it's time to embrace autumn. Rather than mourn those long, lazy sunshine days, I'm feeling pretty excited as I'm in the mood for a make-up makeover! While summer is all about bare-faced beauty, autumn's cool days and long nights allow me to indulge my passion for products, splashing out on gorgeous new colours and scrumptious new ranges from all the big cosmetics brands. Yummy! To kickstart my new-season make-over, I looked to the autumn/winter catwalk collections for inspiration. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Binky looks forward to Autumn as it brings an opportunity for a new beauty look . The runways always offer a wealth of brilliant new beauty ideas, and this season didn't disappoint. Topping my list was the catwalk make-up at British superstar brand Burberry. The show featured rich, autumnal colours - all lush, berry-stained lips and warm, dusky eyes. To help me perfect autumn's berry beauty, I've roped in my former MIC co-star and make-up expert Olivia Newman Young, who has translated the catwalk trend into a sultry evening look. Binky enlisted the help of ex co-star Olivia Newman-Young to create her Burberry inspired look . Binky has taken inspiration from the autumnal colours used in the Burberry autumn/winter 14 make-up . THE EYES . Once you've applied a fresh, dewy base, begin the look with the eyes. Start by drawing a chestnut-brown eyeliner like Clarins Crayon Khol Eye Pencil in Intense Brown along your upper lash line. Don't worry about making the line too neat as next Olivia used a sponge make-up applicator to smudge and blend the liner up into the lid and around the socket, creating a soft wash of colour. Next draw the same brown liner along the water line and lower lash line, and use a fine brush to smudge the excess colour. The overall effect you're going for is warm, soft and sexy. Next up, Olivia used the plum eyeshadow from Dior 5 Couleurs Eye Palette in Femme Fleur, blending the colour around the eye socket, adding a touch of the darker purple from the same palette at the outer edges of the socket. Then just a light dab of Daniel Sandler's Watercolour Crème Bronzer in Riviera at the inner corners of the eye socket, bringing a softness to the eye colours. Finish up with a couple of coats of mascara - Olivia used the Dior Addict-It Mascara in It Black. A hint of brow colour (Guerlain Eyebrow Kit has four shades to mix and match) will add definition, creating brows which frame the eyes beautifully. Binky has opted for deep plum shades to create an autumnal vibe . THE LIPS AND CHEEKS . This look is all about a glamorous, berry-stained pout. Before applying the lip colour, Olivia brushed a touch of concealer around the lip line, then, taking a berry-coloured lip pencil, drew a line along the lips, before filling them in with Clarins True Aubergine lipstick. Next, taking the same Daniel Sandler cream bronzer used on the eyes, blend a hint of pinky colour over the apples of your cheeks to draw the whole look together. A dusting of Michael Kors Sporty Bronzing Powder adds a final warm, autumnal glow to the skin. It's an incredibly sexy, sultry look, and since it's catwalk-inspired, it's naturally bang on trend. You can get all the products Olivia used at Escentual.com. I’ve loved having her teach me a few new looks – you can check out her channel here for loads more amazing beauty tutorials. Binky suggests using warm colours when it comes to fall make-up . I'm so pleased with my new autumn make-up look, I've decided I need some new autumn clothes to go with it. I'm going shopping! On a separate note, I wanted to let you know about the Nutribullet – a really cool kitchen gadget that blasts fruit and veg into super-healthy, nutrient rich drinks. The great thing about the Nutribullet is that, unlike other juicers or blenders, it fully breaks ingredients down into their most nutritious state, transforming ordinary foods into superfoods. It couldn’t be easier to use. Simply load the cup with vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds of your choice, place it over the base and twist. Et voila – a supercharged drink packed full of nutrients in a matter of seconds. You can use the Nutribullet to make a whole range of delicious and healthy juices, smoothies and even soups – it comes with a recipe book crammed with yummy suggestions. The Nutribullet retails for £99 and is available from www.buynutribullet.co.uk. Until next week, stay gorgeous. Love Binky xxx .","Binky waves bye bye to summer with this week's makeover .

"This week I'm going back to the Swinging Sixties to create a look inspired by one of the era's most influential icons Twiggy, with the help of one of my good friends, talented make-up artist Olivia Newman-Young. Olivia created for me a striking yet wearable Twiggy-inspired look with dewy skin, babydoll lashes and faux freckles. If you've got a fancy dress party coming up or simply want to get more creative with your make-up choices, this modern twist on a 60s look is surprisingly not too hard to achieve – here's how! To provide a fresh, glowy base and cover any blemishes, Olivia applied a layer of Clarins True Radiance Perfect Skin Foundation over my face, before moving on to the main focus of the look – the eyes. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sixties chic: Binky chanelled Twiggy for this week's beauty look . First, she took the Daniel Sandler Long Lasting Waterproof Eyeliner in Black Velvet across my socket line, from the inner to the outer corner, to create the quintessentially 60s ‘hollowed socket' effect. She smudged the line with a small round ended brush to make it softer, and flicked it out slightly towards the outer corners. She then took the white highlighter shade from the Guerlain Eyebrow Kit to accentuate the area of my lid under the drawn-on line. To make the look modern and wearable, she used a slightly sheerer white highlighter shade, but any white or cream-coloured shadow should do the trick. Feeling squiffy? Binky was looking a little worse for wear as she headed out with her Chelsea chums last night however her Sixties makeover sees her looking much more polished . To reinforce the eye line, she also dabbed the black eyebrow shade from the Guerlain palette over the pencil. Next, Olivia applied the Dior Addict It-Line Liquid Eyeliner very close to my lash line to add further definition. I do find liquid liner tricky to use sometimes - if you struggle with it too, simply dot the product over the lash line first for a basic outline and then go over it slowly. Binky enlisted the help of ex co-star Olvia Newman-Young to transform her look . As well as being one of Twiggy's staple beauty features, defined, doll-like, spiky lashes were all over the AW14 catwalks. Olivia began by defining my bottom lashes with Dior Addict It-Lash Mascara, applying layer after layer until we achieved the desired volume. She then applied a fluttery set of falsies to my top lashes followed by a few individual false lashes across my bottom ones, to really make my eyes pop. Olivia then used the Clarins Instant Concealer under my eyes to cover any eyeshadow or mascara fallout, setting it in place with a translucent powder. She deliberately used one shade lighter than my skintone to disguise eye bags and brighten up my eye area, as well as to highlight my nose and Cupid's bow. Olivia used a high definition mascara to achieve Binky's doll-like lashes . To achieve a look to mirror Twiggy's Olivia suggests focusing on the eye area with a smoky palette and heavy eyeliner . Next, Olivia added some definition to my face with a light dusting of Michael Kors Bronzing Powder in Sporty over my cheekbones. Fresh skin and doe eyes are the two main beauty components forming this look, so even if you're a tanaholic like myself, try to keep the bronze at bay! In keeping with Twiggy's usual beauty choices, Olivia decided to keep my lips muted, enhancing them with a slick of the gorgeous pinky-nude Michael Kors Lip Lacquer in Diva. Finally – for an authentic Twiggy-style look, Olivia dotted some faux freckles across my nose and cheeks using the Clarins Eyebrow Pencils in Dark Brown and Light Brown, using varying amounts of pressure to keep them looking natural. You can get all the products Olivia used from Escentual.com, and do check out her YouTube channel for some more amazing beauty tutorials and lifestyle videos. Make-up: done.

"Another week, another photoshoot! Although my work can get pretty hectic at times, I do love being on the go, and I was particularly excited for this shoot as it was for my nail polish range Binky London. As summer is sadly on the way out, I've been thinking about launching my Autumn/Winter shades soon, replacing cute pastels and beachy brights with deep berry hues, neutral greys and smouldering metallics. The new collection will be out very soon so keep an eye out! For the shoot, I enlisted the slick skills of expert make-up artist Buster Knight, who was responsible for the super-glam look I wore in Stacey Jackson's Dance The Night Away music video. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Glam: This week Binky has been on set shooting her latest campaign for her nail collection - Binky London . Buster created a soft and natural look for this shoot featuring a warm golden smokey eye, a structured lip and a beach-bronzed bod. I was delighted with the results, so thought I'd share with you how he did it: . THE FACE . A foundation with good coverage is a photoshoot essential, so Buster began by applying DiorSkin Forever Foundation to my face with the Real Techniques Buffing Brush, buffing and blending so the product merged seamlessly with my skin. After setting the base with powder, Buster used the classic Guerlain Terracotta Bronzing Powder to define my cheekbones and warm up my face. Hold on to summer: Binky wanted to soak up the last of the sun with her bronzed babe look . THE EYES . For the shoot, Buster put a summery twist on my all-time beauty fave, the smokey eye. Instead of using harsh greys and blacks, he opted for warmer golden, coppery tones, using the gorgeous Guerlain 6 Couleurs Eye Palette in Francs-Bourgeois. He swept a light base colour all over my lid, before taking a warm brown colour across my lash line, winging it slightly towards the end. Next, he took the shimmery copper shade and lightly patted it all over my lash line, again focusing on the outer corners. The perfect smokey eye presents a sexy, slightly 'worn-in' look, so there's no need to be too precise with application. Do make sure you blend each new shade into the eye well with a blending brush, though, to avoid the result looking patchy. Finally, Buster lined my upper and lower lash lines with the Clarins Crayon Kohl Long Lasting Eye Pencil in Bronze, smudging the product in slightly with a small eye brush. Lashings of Too Faced Size Queen Mascara finished off the eyes. Diet success: Binky said that she was feeling body confident on the shoot following her recent weight loss . THE LIPS . Buster lined my lips first with the Daniel Sandler Long Lasting Lip Liner in Taffy, applying the pencil in gentle brush strokes just outside the lip line to create the illusion of fuller lips. He then filled my lips in with DHC Premium Lipstick in First Blush – a slightly lighter shade – for a structured yet natural looking pout. THE BODY . I was feeling pretty body confident before the shoot – I did indulge slightly in New York (I'm only human!) but managed to keep my dieting under control by taking Forza Raspberry K2 Supplements every day, so was more than happy to get my pins out on the day. Buster applied Rimmel Sunshimmer Instant Tanning Lotion over my arms, legs and décolletage using a body brush for an all-over beach babe bronzed glow. As a final touch, he spritzed some of the Michael Kors Liquid Shimmer Dry Oil Spray down the front of my legs and along my collarbones. This luxurious oil gives the body a luminous, subtle shimmer, enveloping it with its gorgeous orange and jasmine flower scent. You can get all the products Buster used on the shoot, as well as my Binky London nail polishes, from Escentual.com.

"Ched Evans, 25, is set to meet officials from Sheffield United when he is allowed on day release in July with a view to signing a three-year deal in October . Disgraced footballer Ched Evans is set to sign a new deal with his former club when he is on day release from prison this summer. The 25-year-old, who is serving a five-year sentence for rape, will hold talks with officials from Sheffield United in July with a view to signing a £3million deal for the club after his full release in October. The Welsh striker was jailed in April 2012 for raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room in Rhyl, North Wales. But it is . understood that officials from the club, including manager Nigel Clough, have . visited him in during his sentence at HM Wymott in Lancashire and have discussed his . future at the League One side. The prospect of him returning has sparked an angry reaction from a group of supporters who say it would be a 'humiliation'. Almost 60,000 have signed a petition addressed to Kevin McCabe, the club's chairman, urging him not to resign Evans. An extract reads: 'For the male leaders of the club to endorse him and ""welcome him back"" is an absolute humiliation to all women who expect the men who commit gross acts of violence against women to pay for what they have done and part of that is relinquishing the celebrity they attained, and in this case used as a tool to facilitate the violence. 'The clear message to young boys and men is that you will be forgiven for this crime. Women will not be believed when they accuse you of that crime even if a court believes them.
