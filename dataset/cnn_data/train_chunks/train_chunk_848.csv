"By . Jo Knowsley . Ignored: Mohammed Zabar believes the Government should have acted on his guidance sooner . A Muslim father has revealed he warned the Prime Minister’s office of worrying Islamist practices at one of the scandal-hit ‘Trojan Horse’ schools – but got no reply. The Mail on Sunday has learned that David Cameron’s office received an email in February from Mohammed Zabar, whose ten-year-old daughter attends Oldknow Academy. Oldknow is one of the schools investigated in connection with an alleged fundamentalist plot to take over Birmingham schools. Mr Zabar warned the Government that he believed the school over-emphasised Islamic teaching at the expense of other faiths. He said the school closed for a Muslim festival but had no Christmas celebrations. Downing Street did not respond to Mr Zabar’s email. Instead he was advised by the Education Funding Agency to ‘contact Oldknow Academy directly and make a complaint’. Mr Zabar had already met the school principal, whom he says did not deal with his concerns. News of the Trojan Horse plot broke in March and Mr Cameron spoke about it for the first time in April after claims that non-Muslim members of staff were being  isolated, male and female pupils were segregated and assemblies were used to promote the teachings of Al Qaeda. The Prime Minister promised to take ‘swift action’ to ensure schools could not be used to spread the  ideology of terrorists, and an  investigation into schools in Birmingham started. One report later uncovered allegations that pupils as young as six at Oldknow were taught to treat Western women as ‘white prostitutes’. And there were claims that extermists pushed out the head teacher because she opposed the ‘Islamisation’ of the school. Mr Zabar believes the Government should have acted on his guidance much earlier. He said: ‘I was angry and frustrated that my concerns had been so easily dismissed. ‘When the Trojan Horse scandal broke I wrote to them again saying perhaps they might want to reassess my information in light of recent evidence. I never had a reply to that one.It was distressing and disappointing to have my concerns ignored.’ Peter Clarke, former national head of counter-terrorism at the Metropolitan Police, was appointed in April to investigate the Trojan Horse plot to hijack the schools by Islamic extremists. Anti-Christian? Mr Zabar said Oldknow over-emphasised Islamic teaching at the expense of other faiths. It is being investigated in connection with an alleged fundamentalist plot to take over Birmingham schools . His report is due to be handed in to the Government imminently. Last night Shadow Education Secretary Tristram Hunt accused Mr Cameron of ‘shocking complacency’. He said: ‘The Government was warned about the problems in Birmingham’s schools as long ago as 2010. Now it is revealed that warnings by parents were being fobbed off  by No 10.’ A Department for  Education spokesman said: ‘We became aware of  concerns in Birmingham schools in December last year and began investigating immediately. Early warning: Mr Cameron's office received Mr Zabar's email in February - two months before the Trojan Horse plot broke . ‘We were already investigating Oldknow by the time this letter [Mr Zabar’s] was sent.' The email alert about Oldknow is revealed in a Channel 4 Dispatches documentary, to be screened tomorrow night. The TV investigation also features The Olive School, a Muslim faith primary for 600 pupils in Blackburn. It is understood to have found: . Teachers referring to clapping hands as un-Islamic and ‘Satanic’. Teachers allegedly discussing whether music in school might be un-Islamic. Possible evidence of visits by extremist preachers – though the school strongly denies this. The Olive School is run by the Tauheedul Islam Faith, Education and Community Trust. The Trust confirmed that  Dispatches had filmed undercover in The Olive School and promised  to act ‘if anything that emerges  on the film is shown to undermine our progressive vision, ethos  and approach’. A Tauheedul governor said: ‘The trust’s schools provide a first class education for young people in modern-day Britain.’ The governor added: ‘We need to look at what these schools have achieved for their pupils.’Blackburn MP Jack Straw said: ‘I reserve final judgment until I see the programme. From what I know the allegations are groundless.’ Dispatches also reveals concerns over unregistered schools in Hackney, East London, where thousands of Jewish boys appear to disappear from state school registers at the age of 13.","Mohammed Zabar warned of worrying practices at Oldknow Academy .

"By . Bianca London . After three 'reem' years . of vajazzles, make-ups and break-ups on TOWIE, Sam Faiers left the ITV2 show that rocketed her to fame in April. Since then, she has been snapped up by countless beauty brands, seen Minnie's Boutique - the shop she owns with her sister - become a success and even landed herself a top modelling contract. FEMAIL caught up with Sam to find out . her beauty secrets, summer style tips and plans for the future - which . is most certainly looking bright. Scroll down for video . New identity? Sam Faiers, who found fame on TOWIE, has just released her debut fragrance and penned her name as 'Samantha' on the bottle . The 23-year-old's most recent project has seen her launch her debut fragrance, La Bella, and she's keen to be taken more seriously. Speaking about her new perfume, which has vanilla and caramel tones, she told MailOnline: 'I was a real girly girl growing up and my fragrance reflects that. I had an image of how I wanted it to look and I was involved in every step of creating it so it is everything I dreamed of.' Sam, as she has always been known, has also made a bold statement with her debut fragrance. 'I was always known as ""Sam from TOWIE and Big Brother"" and as much as I've been happy with that, I also really love classy and elegant stuff so I have written ""By Samantha"" on the bottle. It sounds nicer,' she explained. While her The Only Way Is Essex friends are living it up in Marbella, Sam reveals that she won't be joining the party. Dream come true: Speaking about her new perfume, which is full of vanilla and caramel tones, she told MailOnline: 'I had an image of how I wanted it to look and I was involved in every step of creating it so it is everything I dreamed of' 'This summer I have lots of holidays planned. I might go to Marbella to visit my nan and grandad but I definitely won't be going to any crazy parties. I am also heading to Ibiza with Joey and the girls and to Spain with Billie and her baby. 'I am also planning on going to Dubai with the family and Joey and I want to go on an exotic holiday really far away when we have time in our busy schedules,' she said of her and her boyfriend's plans. Sharing her summer style tips, Sam said: 'I think you can be more daring on holiday. I'm loving pastel colours, crop tops and little dainty pieces of jewellery.' Sweet smell of success: Sam debuts her La Bella fragrance in Manchester, the latest of her many beauty and fashion projects . Chiming in on Bobby Norris and Harry Derbidge's questionable half thong swimming trunks that have shocked the nation, Sam said: 'How hysterical are those! I didn't think it was actually a thing and I would never like to see Joey wearing one but they can half get away with it and, you know, only in TOWIE hey!'. When it comes to beachside beauty, Sam says she loves to keep in natural and 'doesn't wear a scrap of make-up' in the day and loves to 'scruff her hair into a bun'. With a manic schedule, Sam says she hasn't had time to work out 'as much as she'd like to' but says that when she does exercise, she focuses on toning and not cardio. 'I don't have a lot of weight to shed so I just do lots of lunges, squats and use kettle bells,' she explained. As for the future, Sam says she has 'loads of things' going on. She told us: 'I have lots of exciting things planned with my modelling agency, Elite, for the summer, and have been talking to some TV companies but I'll make sure I choose the right thing for me.'

"By . Bianca London . She's one of Tinseltown's most famous - and photographed - superstars, but since that infamous lift scene, Beyonce has been laying low.

"By . Dan Colasimone . The World Cup final will be viewed in Argentina as a date with destiny for Lionel Messi and the Albicelestes, but Germany’s demolition of Brazil in the semi-finals should serve to temper any over-confidence. It may just suit Argentina to start the big match as the underdog. Any sense that fate would intervene to grant Messi the world title he deserves to cap his remarkable career will be replaced by a knowledge that every Argentinian player on the pitch will have to be at his absolute best to counter Germany’s irresistible brand of precision football. All set: Lionel Messi (centre) trains alongside Ezequiel Lavezzi (left) and Angel di Maria on Saturday . Party time: Argentina fans chant and sing songs as they surround two German fans on the Copacabana beach . Even if the South Americans’ overall team performance is flawless, there is still the feeling that Messi himself will have to show his genius one more time if his side are to win the game. ‘La Pulga’ was kept relatively quiet by the Dutch in the semi-final, but that was a result of the European team forsaking much of their own attacking impetus to concentrate on subduing the No 10. Germany are unlikely to take such a conservative approach. They will surely back their own abilities to overwhelm Argentina in midfield even if Messi is given a little more space than he was against the Netherlands. With Angel Di Maria pulling up sore after his final training session, he is a major doubt to start the final, and may not appear at all, which is a huge blow for Alejandro Sabella’s side. Di Maria was not at his brilliant best throughout the campaign, but he did offer a crucial attacking counterpoint to Messi. Enzo Perez has done a solid job of replacing the Real Madrid man, though he does not quite have the match-winning ability of Di Maria. Doubt: Di Maria is a major doubt for the World Cup final after pulling up sore after training on Saturday . All set: Javier Mascherano (right) looks on during training on Saturday ahead of the final against Germany . Argentina’s other attacking stars have not lived up to their pre-tournament billing as the best offensive unit in the competition. Ezequiel Lavezzi, Sergio Aguero and Gonzalo Higuain have not shone with any consistency, though the Napoli forward was superb against Belgium in the quarter-finals. If they can all finally click at the Maracana, Germany will certainly have their hands full. Another key to success for Argentina is Sabella himself. He has proven himself to be an astute manager throughout the World Cup, displaying a flexibility that several of his more bullish predecessors in the role did not. Ready for action: Argentina's Sergio Aguero (left) warms up as he gets set for the final on Sunday . Instructions: Argentina players listen to coach Alejandro Sabella (white cap) during training in Rio de Janeiro . Though he has worked with a preferred starting XI for almost two years, as the tournament unfolded he was willing to tinker with personnel and tactics as the situation warranted. Fernando Gago, for example, was the player originally tasked with being the supply line to Messi. When he proved too lightweight in midfield, however, Sabella dropped him for the more energetic Lucas Biglia. The manager is also more of a pragmatist than the likes of Marcelo Bielsa, Diego Maradona or Jose Pekerman, and although the team have not played pretty football in every game, Albiceleste fans are more than content to see their side in a final again after 24 years, following so many capitulations at the quarter-final stage or earlier. Preparations: Argentina players warm up during their training session at Estadio Sao Januario . On the beach: An Argentina fan wearing a Messi shirt stands on the Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro . Images of hundreds of thousands of joyful Argentinians taking to the 9 de Julio avenue in central Buenos Aires to celebrate each successive victory in the competition indicate how much this tournament means to the country’s people. A win in the final would spark a party for the ages.

"By . Kit Holden . For the first time at this World Cup, everyone is on the same page in Germany. That page is the front page of the Bild, which for the last three days has simply been a countdown to Sunday's World Cup Final. Three days to go. Two days to go. One day to go. Before the 7-1 win over Brazil, Germany was hardly united behind their team. Coach Joachim Low was criticised at every turn, and many people were frustrated at how drab the football had been. Now it is different. Now everybody is impatiently awaiting the moment when the clock strikes nine o'clock on Sunday evening, and the World Cup final begins. Heroes: Germany are one victory away from winning their fourth World Cup title . Rout: Germany thrashed Brazil 7-1 in the semi-final and their nation now expects to be crowned champions . Preparation: The German team train in Rio on the eve the World Cup final at the Maracana . The final countdown: German newspaper Bild . It will be Germany's eighth final, and the whole country is desperate for their team to win it for the fourth time. The phrase on everyone's lips is 'fourth star'. It refers to the stars sewn above the emblem on the Germany shirt. At the moment, there are three, one for each time Germany have won this tournament. Adidas Germany released an advert this week saying that the shirt with three stars is only available for a short time longer. Above the Berlin headquarters of the SPD, Germany's second biggest political party, there is a banner reading 'Get the fourth star, boys!'. In all those messages, there is confidence that Germany will, indeed, get the fourth star. After the demolition of Brazil, the nation believes that they are favourites. There is little arrogance, though. People know how good Lionel Messi is, how rigid Argentina have been at the back in this tournament. They know it could go wrong. Low and . his team are also going out of the way to play down any mindless . euphoria. After the Brazil game, Low demanded 'humility', and that has . been the party line from the squad ever since. Philipp Lahm and Thomas Muller have spoken about how well they understand the dangers of Argentina. Backing: The public, press and advertisers in Germany have all joined the bandwagon . Lethal: All time World Cup record scorer Miroslav Klose (left) and Bayern forward Thomas Muller . Muller, though, could not resist adding 'if nothing else works, we'll just score from a set piece. We're already world champions in that'. For among the humility, there is a powerful optimism. Oliver Bierhoff's statement that all players were fit and ready to play did a lot to alleviate fears. Mats Hummels in particular was a doubt for the final, and many see him as a key to stopping Messi. 'We have a plan for Messi' said Low's . assistant Hansi Flick on Thursday. Many are confident that it will work, . and are pointing to the way Bayern played the Argentine out of the game . last year when they faced Barcelona in the Champions League. Leader: Manager Joachin Low takes a shot on goal during a training session in Rio de Janeiro . Opposition: Argentina train at their base just outside Belo Horizonte in preparation for the showdown . Many have said that, after he result against Brazil, this German side have already made history. That has helped to loosen the pressure on this team, but the note between humility and optimism that Low's team are striking is a sensible one. In the supermarket, one cashier wished an elderly gentleman a good weekend after finishing his shopping. 'It'll only be a good weekend if we win the World Cup', he said. Germany expects.","Germany one win away from winning their fourth World Cup .

"By . John Drayton . Manchester City are close to signing £32million French defender Eliaquim Mangala, further breaking the quota on overseas players permitted in a Premier League squad. Mangala, 23, has agreed to join City from Porto and form a defensive partnership with Vincent Kompany that manager Manuel Pellegrini hopes will succeed at home and in the Champions League. However, he will be City’s fourth foreign signing and that means Pellegrini must cut some of his existing foreigners. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Man City target Eliaquim Mangala scoring for Porto .

"By . Binky Felstead . Less is more is a wise mantra, especially when it comes to make-up products. As a beauty blogger, I am lucky enough to try out all sorts of amazing goodies, and I'm always on the look out for innovative new purchases. However, rather than stuffing my make-up bag with tons and tons of items, I regularly edit my kit to ensure I only carry what I need. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . This week Binky shows you how to achieve a great evening look without looking too over-done . Old make-up does go off and not only loses its effectiveness, but can end up tasting and smelling less than perfect. A few weeks ago I gave my daytime cosmetics a summer refresh, and it felt great to dump all the dried-out mascaras and curdled lip glosses. So this week I'm rebooting my nighttime beauty bag - chucking away tired items and investing in some new kit. When it came to picking the perfect evening products, I took my inspiration from the sultry look I was given on a recent photo shoot for Rimmel. Smokey eyes and nude lips are true beauty classics, and easy to achieve using the following buys: . BINKY'S EVENING KIT . bareMinerals Ready To Go Complexion Perfection Palette. This is a very nifty all-in-one face palette that ensures you can create a flawless base whether you're at home or on the go. Cover blemishes with the Ready Foundation and the Correcting Concealer, sculpt and highlight with the Bronzer and the Luminizer, and then finish with a flourish of the Touch Up Veil to set it all in place. Clever! Guerlain Terracotta 4 Seasons Tailor Made Bronzing Powder . It goes without saying that my evening kit contains a bronzer as I love to give my skin a warm, sexy glow. Guerlain bronzers are the original and the best, and this is my current fave. As the name suggests, it has four different shades so you can adapt the finish according to your skin tone and the lighting. Clarins Eye Quartet Mineral Palette in Vibrant Light . An eye palette is an evening must-have as you don't want to be lugging around endless pots and powders. This little gem from Clarins contains exactly the shimmering shades you need to create the perfect smokey eye. The soft pink is a great base tone, the rich grey and navy add depth and detail, while a dot of the glistening silver in the inner corners of your eyes adds a luxe finishing touch and really makes your eyes sparkle. Dior Diorshow Art Pen Felt-Tip Eyeliner . An eyeliner is another important buy - whether you're going for a subtle streak during the day or an intense swoosh for evening, liner adds instant glamour. If you're after a smudgy finish then a soft eye pencil will work, but I prefer a strong clean cat's-eye flick that you get with a liner pen. This one has a felt-tip applicator, which delivers a clean, precise and intense line. Binky says it is important to regularly refresh your make-up bag as cosmetics can go off . Daniel Sandler Jumbo Jet Mascara . A great mascara is a no-brainer - a few extra coats will boost your lashes from daytime pretty to nighttime gorgeous. It's vital that you regularly refresh your mascara as it will dry out and lose its effectiveness, try not to pump the brush and let air into the tube. This one is amazing - it's by Daniel Sandler, a celebrity make-up artist who really knows what makes a great product - and it creates lush evening lashes without clumping or spiking. Stila Lip Glaze in Lemongrass . This look would work well with a traditional lipstick, but I'm a total lip-gloss girl so this Stila product is a dream find for me. It has the easy application and texture of a gloss, but with the pigmentation level of a lipstick. It comes in a fabulous range of shades, and this nude works a treat when you're rocking a smokey eye. Sheer brilliance! Binky recommends these beauty must-haves to achieve the perfect evening look . So it's out with the old and in with the new! Each one of these fantastic products is available at my favourite online beauty boutique, escentual.com. However, I do know that refreshing your make-up bag with new buys can really add up, so I've come up with a list of budget alternatives to keep you gorgeous without breaking the bank.

"By . Phil Casey . Rory McIlroy's course record at Royal Aberdeen lasted just three days as Chile's Felipe Aguilar carded a superb 63 in the final round of the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open. McIlroy's 64 on Thursday had come just two hours after Sweden's Kristoffer Broberg established a new record with a 65 after going out in the first group at 6:30am. And Aguilar went one better on Sunday morning as he took advantage of the rain-softened course and no wind to fire eight birdies, six of them in seven holes in a front nine of 30. New holder: Rory McIlroy's record lasted just three days due to Felipe Aguilar's display . Record breaker: Felipe Aguilar went one better than McIlroy by carding an impressive 63 . 'It's pretty amazing,' said Aguilar, who won his second European Tour title in Singapore earlier this season with a final round of 62. 'I haven't hit the ball that well since Singapore. 'I hit it really good, made a couple of of long putts and overall it was a really, really good round. I did not get into any trouble and the only green I missed was on the 18th because I went for the flag. 'Finishing like this on this course is a very good way to finish because I was struggling the first three days. The course was a little softer and you could be more aggressive. It probably won't be the only round of eight under.' England's Justin Rose and Scotland's Marc Warren shared the lead on 10 under par but were not due off until shortly after 3pm. Meanwhile, McIlroy has been urged to try Castle Stuart for himself after it was confirmed the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open will return there in 2016. Ahead of competing at Royal Aberdeen this week, McIlroy said that he had not played the Scottish Open in recent years because Castle Stuart - host from 2011 to 2013 - did not provide 'a true links test' in the week before the Open Championship. The two-time major winner is likely to approve of Sunday's confirmation that a composite course made up from 15 holes of Gullane No 1 and three from Gullane No 2 will host the tournament next year. Strong views: McIlroy is not the biggest fan of Scottish course Castle Stuart . Disappointed: Castle Stuart general manager Stuart McColm (far right) is unhappy with McIlroy's comments . But it remains to be seen whether he will change his opinion of Castle Stuart to play there in 2016 ahead of the Open at Royal Troon. Castle Stuart general manager Stuart McColm said: 'The disappointment for me is that Rory has never been. I don't know how he can say something about a golf course he has never seen. 'Why doesn't he come up there and play it before making up his mind.' In addition to confirming the venues for the next two years, it was also revealed on Sunday that next year's Scottish Open will be preceded by a new 54-hole qualifying event which will offer six places in the tournament to Scottish golfers. European Tour chief executive George O'Grady said: 'Together with the Scottish Government and Aberdeen Asset Management, we are delighted to announce Gullane and Castle Stuart as the next two venues for the championship. 'At Gullane we will be treated to one of the game's most historical venues, while Castle Stuart will once again showcase a truly modern links test.'","Felipe Aguilar breaks Rory McIlroy's Royal Aberdeen course record .

"By . Simon Jones . Manchester United are hoping for a breakthrough in discussions over the £35million transfer of Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal. The Chile international shares the same agent as Alexis Sanchez, Fernando Felicevich, and talks are understood to have taken place on Friday. Sanchez signed for Arsenal on Thursday in a £30m move and United hope his international team-mate Vidal could follow him to the Premier League. VIDEO Scroll down to watch United target Arturo Vidal score for Chile . Hot on the trail: Manchester United have stepped up their interest in Juventus and Chile star Arturo Vidal . Negotiating process: Vidal's agent is understood to have held talks with United on Friday . Vidal joined Juventus in 2011 from Bayer Leverkusen and has seen his stock rise after playing a central role in the club's three consecutive Serie A titles, making a name for himself as a player who is equally comfortable tackling tough or scoring and assisting goals. The 27-year-old travelled to the 2014 World Cup with Chile despite having surgery on a knee injury in early May and helped his country reach the second round before they were defeated by Brazil on penalties. Vidal signed a contract extension with Juventus in December last year tying him to the club until 2017. United also have interest in Real Madrid's Angel di Maria but face competition from Paris Saint-Germain. The Argentina international was injured during the 2014 World Cup quarter-final win against Belgium but made a return to light training on Thursday and could yet feature in the final on Sunday.

"By . Sam Peters . Red-faced former England captain and Sky commentator Andrew Strauss has apologised to Kevin Pietersen after a foul-mouthed tirade against his former team-mate was accidentally broadcast live. Strauss, at Lord’s for the match between an MCC XI and Rest of the World XI, believed he was off air during an ad break but was overheard describing South African-born Pietersen as an ‘absolute c***’ on a feed broadcast to Fox Sports. Strauss, also born in South Africa, made the crass remark as Pietersen batted for the Rest of the World. Sky then tweeted an apology before Strauss went on air to say: ‘I apologise unreservedly, particularly to Kevin Pietersen. I am mortified and profusely sorry.’ AUDIO Scroll down to listen to Andrew Strauss's on air apology . KP: Kevin Pietersen was appearing for a Rest of the World XI to celebrate Lord's bi-centenary . Controversy: Sky and Andrew Strauss (left) apologised after he was overheard making the 'inappropriate comments' Troubled past: Pietersen was dropped after admitting making provocative comments about Strauss . A senior Sky insider said there would be no further action against Strauss but there was outrage on social media from fans angered by Pietersen’s England exile after bust-ups with team-mates and officials. Sky would . not confirm the precise nature of the conversation that was accidentally . transmitted but did tweet an apology via its Sky Sports Cricket . platform. It read: 'Earlier comments were made during a break of play which were heard overseas. We apologise for the language used.' Pietersen, 34, was sacked after last winter’s 5-0 Ashes whitewash and journalist and broadcaster Piers Morgan — a Pietersen ally —called for Sky to axe Strauss. He tweeted: ‘If Strauss story is true then he’ll have to be fired, surely? Or is a commentator calling @KP24 a ‘****’ on air acceptable @SkyCricket ?’ Support act: Pietersen's close friend has called for Piers Morgan has called for Strauss to be sacked . Strauss . fell out with Pietersen in 2012 after the batsman insulted his captain . in text messages to friends in the South Africa dressing room. Morgan's comments referred to a troubled past between the former team-mates. In 2012 Pietersen was dropped after sending messages to friends in the touring South Africa side which he admitted were 'provocative'. Those messages were reported to be highly critical of Strauss, though suggestions that they included advice on how to get the opener out have been denied by Pietersen. After a dramatic draw with the Proteas at Headingley, Pietersen started a memorably tetchy press conference by declaring he would not wait for skipper Strauss, who was also due to speak. Court in the act: Strauss, pictured with Sachin Tendulkar at Wimbledon, admitted having issues with Pietersen . Speaking after the incident, Pietersen said: 'I apologise to Straussy and the team for the inappropriate remarks at the press conference and for the texts. I truly didn't mean to cause upset or tension. I need to rein myself in sometimes.' Strauss, who retired soon after, reflected on the issue in his autobiography, Driving Ambition.He wrote: 'For me, he had crossed the line. He seemed to be at best destabilising and at worst undermining our carefully cultivated team environment. 'I did...have issues with him criticising me to the opposition. That felt like talking out of school, not to mention giving the opposition a way to drive a wedge between Pietersen and myself and the team.' Strauss has been conciliatory about Pietersen in much of his commentary work but it seems he may have been concealing less savoury views. VIDEO Stauss backs England . Three months ago Kevin Pietersen said he was ‘good friends’ with Andrew Strauss. In his own mind, Pietersen may have believed it, but the accidentally aired assessment of him as a ‘complete ****’ by a man universally respected in the game, has removed any room for doubt. In Pietersen’s eyes he is the victim of unfair treatment at the hands of the ECB. The reality is he has burned too many bridges and fallen out with everyone he has ever worked with. Fortunate to be reintegrated into the team after betraying Strauss with derogatory texts to ‘close friends’ in the South African team in 2012, Pietersen was also divisive in Australia last winter. Perhaps he did not realise how he had hurt Strauss with the ‘textgate’ affair with his former captain subsequently writing in his autobiography: ‘For me, he had crossed the line. He seemed to be at best destabilising and at worst undermining our cultivated team environment.’ He was eventually sacked because he had become a toxic figure, with senior players unable to trust him and unwilling to put up with him taking the contrary line on almost every decision current captain Alastair Cook or senior management attempted to make. While other stars of cricket chose to refrain from talking about other matters ahead of the Lord’s bicentennial match between the MCC and Rest of the World, Pietersen used the platform to remind the public of his desire to play for England again, blaming his downfall on media ‘spin’. Saturday’s bicentennial game — which saw Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne break his hand after being hit by a beamer from former team-mate Brett Lee — was completely overshadowed by Strauss’s gaffe regarding Pietersen. He retains a degree of support among the public and was warmly applauded to the crease yesterday before making 10 off 13 balls. But he has little support in the England dressing room while senior ECB figures insist their stance has hardened since his sacking. His ‘friends’ are simply not in the right places.                                                      SAM PETERS .","Sky have apologised for inappropriate comments made by Andrew Strauss .

"By . Stephen Davies . The referee accused of favouring Lionel Messi earlier this tournament will be in charge of Sunday’s World Cup Final. Italy’s Nicola Rizzoli was slammed by Belgium manager Marc Wilmots after the 1-0 quarter-final defeat by Argentina last weekend. Wilmots said: ‘I don’t want to be a cry baby, but I noticed the referee never gives fouls against Argentina. Every time something happens with Messi the referee gives him a free-kick. In charge: Italian referee Nicola Rizzoli will referee Sunday's World Cup final between Argentina and Germany . Final: Lionel Messi and Argentina will face Germany at the Maracana on Sunday for the World Cup . ‘I notice he (Messi) made three fouls and no yellow card, we made one foul and one yellow card.’ It will be the third time this World Cup that Rizzoli has refereed a match involving Argentina — he was also in charge of the South Americans’ 3-2 victory over Nigeria in a Group F clash. The fact that Argentina has a long history of immigration from Italy only increases the chances of Rizzoli being accused of bias. Perhaps no one understands the pressure that Rizzoli will be under when he referees football’s biggest match than Howard Webb. Webb refereed the 2010 final between Spain and Holland in South Africa and was shortlisted for this evening’s clash before Fifa opted for 42-year-old Rizzoli. And the Yorkshireman said: ‘There is nothing quite like it. The World Cup Final is a match unlike any others.

"By . Mark Prigg . It is set to be one of the best summers in history for sun watchers. Tonight will see the first of three 'supermoons', where the sun appears far bigger and brighter than normal. July 12th, August 10th, and Sept. 9th will all be supermoons, Nasa said, with August's being 'extra super'. Scroll down for video . A supermoon rises over the temple of Poseidon, the ancient Greek god of the seas, in Cape Sounion some 60 km (37 miles) east of Athens June 23, 2013. On Saturday a perigee moon coincides with a full moon creating a super moon when it will pass by the earth at its closest point . The supermoon is not the technical term for the full Moon. Astronomers call this phenomenon a 'perigee moon,' which describes the full moon that occurs when the moon is at its closest point to Earth each year. Perigee marks the closest point of a body as it orbits around Earth, while apogee marks the farthest point from Earth. Full Moons vary in size because of the oval shape of the Moon's orbit. The Moon follows an elliptical path around Earth with one side ('perigee') about 50,000 km closer than the other ('apogee'). Full Moons that occur on the perigee side of the Moon's orbit seem extra big and bright. This coincidence happens three times in 2014. On July 12th and Sept 9th the Moon becomes full on the same day as perigee. On August 10th it becomes full during the same hour as perigee - arguably making it an extra-super Moon. However, Geoff Chester of the US Naval Observatory say the phenomenon is not actually that rare - it's just that we normally miss it. 'Generally speaking, full Moons occur near perigee every 13 months and 18 days, so it's not all that unusual,' he says. 'In fact, just last year there were three perigee Moons in a row, but only one was widely reported.' He believes the 'hanging moon' is likely to be the thing most people remember. Supermoon over New York: For reasons not fully understood by astronomers or psychologists, low-hanging Moons look unnaturally large when they beam through trees, buildings and other foreground objects. A silhouetted airplane flies past a 'super moon' over New York on June 23, 2013. 'The ‘Moon Illusion’  is probably what will make people remember this coming set of Full Moons, more than the actual view of the Moon itself,' he said. The illusion occurs when the Moon is near the horizon. For reasons not fully understood by astronomers or psychologists, low-hanging Moons look unnaturally large when they beam through trees, buildings and other foreground objects. When the Moon illusion amplifies a perigee Moon, the swollen orb rising in the east at sunset can seem super indeed. 'I guarantee that some folks will think it's the biggest Moon they've ever seen if they catch it rising over a distant horizon, because the media will have told them to pay attention to this particular one,' says Chester. 'There's a part of me that wishes that this 'super-Moon' moniker would just dry up and blow away, like the 'Blood-Moon' that accompanied the most recent lunar eclipse, because it tends to promulgate a lot of mis-information,' admits Chester. 'However, if it gets people out and looking at the night sky and maybe hooks them into astronomy, then it's a good thing.'","July 12th, August 10th, and Sept. 9th will all be supermoons .

"By . Laurie Whitwell . Follow @@lauriewhitwell . Luis Suarez will pull on the same shirt once occupied by some iconic names when he returns from his ban to take the field for Barcelona. Alexis Sanchez departing to Arsenal left the No 9 vacant only for a day. Suarez wore the No 7 at Liverpool but adopts the premier striker’s shirt at the Nou Camp; whether Lionel Messi and Neymar will allow him that position on the pitch is another matter. Suarez follows in illustrious steps: . Ronaldo (Barcelona 1996-97) The Phenomenon at his best. In one season aged 20 Ronaldo made himself a hero in Catalonia, scoring 47 goals in 49 games in all competitions including the winner in the Cup Winners’ Cup final under Bobby Robson. Samba star: Ronaldo lit up La Liga well before his days as a Real Madrid striker . His pace, touch and finishing was like no other and one goal against Compostela is worthy of its own highlights reel. During the season he became the youngest World Footballer of the Year. Patrick Kluivert (1998-2004) Brought in by Louis Van Gaal as part of his Dutch revolution, Kuivert was one of Europe’s most sought after strikers having scored the winning goal in the Champions League final with Ajax. Dutch of class: Patrick Kluivert became one of Europe's most sought out strikers after winning the Champions League with Ajax . He turned down the advances of Manchester United and struck up a dynamic partnership with Rivaldo, winning La Liga in his first season. In all he scored 120 goals in 255 appearances. Samuel Eto’o (2004-2009) The most decorated No 9 of the lot. Eto’o paid immediate dividends, scoring 29 goals in all competitions as Barca won La Liga in his debut season. Salute: Samuel Eto'o's goals helped Barcelona to many trophies during his five-year spell . The next year he won the Spanish golden boot and was man-of-the-match in the Champions League final victory over Arsenal. He also scored in the 2009 win over Manchester United – his 129th goal in 201 games for the club – and completed the Treble. Zlatan Ibrahimovic (2009-10) Perhaps the only stellar No 9 to be deemed a flop, Ibrahimovic nevertheless scored 21 goals in 45 appearances and won La Liga, UEFA Super Cup, and the Club World Cup. Couldn't settle: Zlatan Ibrahimovic moved on after just one season in La Liga . But he was never settled and loathed Lionel Messi’s influence, later saying very uncomplimentary things about manager Pep Guardiola. He spent a season on loan at AC Milan before signing permanently. P.S. Suarez becomes the fifth winner of the European Golden Shoe to be signed by Barcelona. The Uruguayan scored 31 Premier League goals for Liverpool last season to win the award jointly with Cristiano Ronaldo. All have done pretty well. Hans Krankl, Rapid Vienna, 41 goals 1977-78 . In his first Liga season he scored 29 goals to top the charts in Spain and finish third top scorer in Europe. He also shone in the victorious Cup Winners’ Cup final. Handy work: Hans Krankl would help Barcelona to win the Cup-Winners' Cup . Hristo Stoichkov, CSKA Sofia, 38 goals 1989-90 . A club legend and one of the most iconic members of Johan Cruyff’s Dream Team, wining the European Cup in 1992 and the Ballon d’Or in 1994 as well as five La Liga titles. Bulgarian brute: Hristo Stoichkov celebrates scoring for Barcelona against Manchester United in the Champions League . Henrik Larsson, Celtic, 35 goals 2000-01 The Swede joined Barca in 2004 on a free transfer and while not posting incredible scoring figures added a dimension to the team. He got 19 goals in 58 games and won two La Liga titles and the Champions League. Winning the big one: Henrik Larsson (right) celebrates winning the Champions League title in 2006 .

"By . Mike Dawes . Nathan Cleverly admits that there is plenty of pressure on both Tony Bellew and himself to get through their fights at the Echo Arena in Liverpool in order to set up a huge rematch. Cleverly returns to the scene of his WBO world light heavyweight title triumph over Bellew in October 2011, and since then their bitter rivalry has shown no signs of cooling.

Lets do it again: Cleverly and Tony Bellew are set to rematch later this year . 'It's the calm before storm really, we both have business to take care of first but this is 'Collision Course' - the idea is that Bellew and I both win and we get the rematch on.

David and Natalie Norris were devastated after their home in Kingsley, Northants, was raided by burglars last Saturday. The £1,000 bling was stolen, along with jewellery belonging to David's late mother, who passed away in February. Bride and groom: Natalie and David Norris, pictured here, used Haribio sweets as rings as their own wedding bands had been stolen the night before their big day . Sweethearts: Natalie and David Norris went ahead with their wedding, despite their rings being stolen from their home the night before. They used sweets instead, which they had blessed by the vicar and later ate . But David and Natalie, both nightclub owners, were determined not to let the burglars ruin their special day. Determined to push ahead with their wedding day the couple found a unique alternative to replace their expensive rings: They used two ring-shaped sweets selected from a 99p bag of Haribo. On Sunday they married, as planned, at The Manor Hotel in Meriden, West Midlands, going to nearby St. Laurence's Church, where the jelly rings were even blessed by vicar. The happy couple then returned to the hotel to celebrate their nuptials with 170 guests - and eat their tasty new rings. Joyus: 'Despite a fire alarm going off the day went without a major hitch and we are now looking forward to our new life together,' says Natalie . The couple, who have been together for . 19 years, had left a front door unlocked for their son to . come in from work from a restaurant. All . the items had been left in the kitchen in preparation for their wedding . and the usual intruder deterrents - the couple's two 40-kilo crossbreed . dogs - had been taken into kennels. Natalie, 39, said: 'It was one thing to know someone had been in your house, but the things they took were so personal. 'It was obvious they were wedding rings, they were on a table of wedding stuff - how anybody could stoop so low, I don't know. 'I was absolutely devastated. We looked . for new rings in a few jewellery shops on Saturday, but we had taken . so much time choosing our rings and waiting for them to be . delivered, I didn't just want to get a new one.

Despite a rogue fire alarm going off, the couple's special day went without any further hitch. They are appealing to pawn shop owners and secondhand dealers to look out for the stolen rings and jewellery and are looking forward to their new life together in the meantime. 'We weren't just going to lie down and let them spoil our wedding day,' says David, 43. 'We were determined to have fun regardless and we had a fantastic time in the end. 'It was a nice touch to get the rings blessed but we ate them in the end - they were getting very sticky. 'They [the burglars] are the lowest of the low, but you just have to get on with things. I just hope they get caught now.' Along with the rings the burglars took a laptop, Pandora bracelet and Ted Baker and Calvin Klein bags.

Charley Hull was only three when Paul Lawrie came from 10 shots back to win the Open Championship in 1999 but that was her inspiration as she mounted her own remarkable fightback at the Women’s British Open. The stand overlooking the 18th green at Royal Birkdale buzzed with excited chatter as Hull birdied the final hole, completing a stunning round of 66, arguably her best ever. After opening her round with two bogies, the Kettering teenager carded nine birdies — including five of the final seven holes — to take her to one under and within striking distance of her first major victory. On the charge: Charley Hull hits her second shot on the 17th hole during the third round . Hull moved . from 51st and 11 shots adrift on Friday to tied seventh, three shots . behind leader Inbee Park of South Korea going into today’s final round. But for a brief loss of concentration when she three-putted the 17th, . she might have been even closer. She . said: ‘I said to my dad on  Friday night, “I’m not out of this . Championship. I can still win it”. I remembered Paul Lawrie at . Carnoustie was 10 shots behind in the final round. I didn’t have a score . in mind but 66 is definitely nice.’ Hull, . 18, has boundless potential. She was named Rookie of the Year on the . Ladies European Tour in 2013 and just over a year on from turning . professional she already has one win, five second places and one top 10 . major finish to her name. Hull . started hitting golf balls at the age of two and retains a childlike . fearlessness in her game, following her uncomplicated mantra of ‘hit it, . find it, hit it again’. ‘I . just go out and do my thing,’ she said. ‘I don’t realise that I play . aggressive golf but I probably do. If it’s a stupid pin position, I’m . not going to take it on but if it’s reasonable, I just go for it. Golf . is a strange sport but it’s only as complicated as you make it. I try to . keep it simple.’ Impressive: Charley Hull carded a best of the day 66 to move within three shots of the leader . That . included visualising the pine and beech trees that line the fairways at . Woburn golf club, her training base between tournaments. ‘I . find it hard to see links courses because everything is so flat. My . coach (Lee Scarbrow, who tutored a young Ian Poulter) helps me picture . the trees. It’s great because I’m changing the whole picture and  it’s . really helped me this week to imagine tree-lined courses.’ It . served her well on the par-five 18th, where she had racked up a bogey . and double bogey on the two previous days.  ‘I tried to pretend it was a . really wide hole and managed to hit the fairway,’ she said. ‘I was most . pleased with that because I’ve nearly hit three balls out of bounds to . the right off the tee this week.’ Several . life-size cardboard cut-outs of Hull, who supports Liverpool, are . dotted around the hospitality centre at Royal Birkdale but she claimed . to thrive on the pressure of playing in front of a home crowd. ‘I feel I . have stepped up and proved myself. The pressure is good because it . shows you have played well coming into a tournament.’ Happy returns: Inbee Park of South Korea celebrated 26th birthday with third-round lead and a cake . There . is a yawning gap of good women British golfers after Dame Laura Davies, . 50, Catriona Matthew, 44, and 41-year-old Karen Stupples, who retired . this week. But Hull heads a relative wealth of talented young golfers, . including Northern Ireland’s Stephanie Meadow and Lincolnshire’s Holly . Clyburn. Hull, . who was home schooled from the age of 13 and still relies on her dad . driving her to Woburn to  practise until sunset most days, once admitted . she could have  chosen a very different path. ‘I . would probably have left school at 16,’ she said, ‘My friends are . beauticians and hairdressers and stuff like that. My friends who  are . boys are mostly builders. So  I’d have probably gone down the beautician . road.’ With . her pinpoint precision and effortless ability to shoot the breeze it is . a career that would have suited her very well, but hairdressing’s loss . is very much golf’s gain.","Hull, 18, is just three shots off the lead after a stunning third round of 66 at Royal Birkdale .

"By . Richard Arrowsmith . Nike's groundbreaking promotional World Cup video featuring the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Neymar didn't do their top ambassadors much good at the tournament proper. The animated short sees football superstars including David Luiz, Franck Ribery, Andres Iniesta and Zlatan Ibrahimovic join forces against 'the clones' as part of the sportswear company's 'riskeverything' campaign. However, while football's greatest players overcame their adversaries in the five-minute animated film entitled 'The Last Game', all except US goalkeeper Tim Howard didn't fare so well when faced with the reality of the tournament. Scroll down for videos... Curse of Nike: Seven of the eight stars featured in groundbreaking video had World Cups to forget . 1. David Luiz . The former Chelsea defender scored a wordly of a free-kick to setlle the quarter-final game against Colombia but his typically cavalier defending was partly blamed for Brazil's 7-1 humiliation at the hands of the Germans. Tearful exit: David Luiz's gung-ho defending was cruelly exposed in Brazil's 7-1 humiliation by Germany . 2. Andres Iniesta . The Barcelona playmaker was part of the Spain team that sounded the death knell for tiki-taka when the reigning champions crashed out after only two games following a 5-1 hammering by Holland and lacklustre defeat to Chile. The pain in Spain: Andres Iniesta (L) saw the reigning champion's run come to an abrupt end in Brazil . 3. Neymar . Perhaps the saddest moment at the World Cup came after Brazil's poster had inspired an average side towards the semi-finals only for a late, robust challenge by Colombia's Juan Zuniga to rule him out for the rest of the tournament with a broken vertebrae. Back to square one: Neymar was ruled out of the tournament after breaking a vertebrae... the rest is history . 4. Cristiano Ronaldo . The . preening Portuguese was beset by niggling injuries ahead of the . tournament and failed to inspire his side past Germany and the US in the . group stages, before scoring his only goal against Ghana. To make . matters worse, his arch nemesis Lionel Messi has reached the final. The shame! Cristiano Ronaldo couldn't inspire Portugal... while arch rival Lionel Messi reached the final . 5. Tim Howard . There . is always an exception to the rule and the US keeper's heroics, . especially in a thrilling extra-time defeat to Belgium raised his stock . to the extent that he received a personal call from President Barrack . Obama amid cries to have a Washington airport named after him. Super saver: Tim Howard was the exception with his goalkeeping heroics before being edged out by Belgium . 6. Franck Ribery .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A quarter of parents said that work pressures meant they were too busy to read a bedtime story to their child (file picture) Bath, story, then bed – so goes the traditional evening routine for children. But a study revealed yesterday  that one in five parents don’t read a bedtime story to their children. A quarter of those parents said that work pressures meant they were too busy – but eight per cent confessed that they just find the ritual boring. 14 per cent aren't usually at home . when their child goes to bed, while another one in 20 per cent admit they . simply can't be bothered. And now the trend is to swipe and scroll through their favourite book rather than turn the pages – as one in four children are now more likely to read their bedtime story on a tablet or e-reader than in a printed book. But the gadgets may actually be . helping children to read with more than half of parents claiming their . offspring would be more likely to read if they could do so with an . e-reader or tablet. Researchers also found that 42 per cent of . parents are worried about whether their child spends enough time . reading, with 92 per cent believing it's important to read with their . child. The study of 2,000 parents was commissioned by the film The Book Thief to mark its release on DVD. It also found that of those parents who do read to children before bed, most will stop the routine once their child reaches the age of seven – with 17 per cent admitting they stop before they even start school. A spokesman for The Book Thief said: 'For most families, the bedtime routine wouldn't be complete without a story or two before tucking the children in. 'But in today's busy society, it seems this part of the day is sometimes hard to find time for. One in four children are now more likely to read their bedtime story on a tablet or e-reader than in a book . 'We are busier than ever before with many young families having to work around two working parents, school or nursery schedules and clubs or sports of older children. 'The bedtime story is an important part of childhood. In our busy lives, it gives you a great bit of time to really sit down with no distractions for some quality time at the end of the day. 'It is also an important introduction to books and story time for young children and hopefully something they will continue to do as they get older.'","Study found a quarter of parents said they were too busy because of work .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . A father is attempting to swim 2,000 miles across the Atlantic Ocean in under two months. Ben Hooper, 35, will set off from Dakar in Senegal on 1 November 2015 - and hopes to reach Natal, northern Brazil by New Years Eve. The father-of-one will swim freestyle for 12 hours a day in two six-hour blocks before sleeping aboard a boat overnight. Scroll down for video . Ben Hooper, pictured in training earlier in the year, is to embark on a 2,000-mile swim across the Atlantic Ocean. His journey will be streamed online - so viewers can keep up with every minute . The father-of-one will set off from Dakar, Senegal on November 1 - and hopes to reach Natal, northern Brazil by New Year's Eve. He will swim for 12 hours a day in two, six hour blocks . Mr Hooper, who may burn up to 12,000 calories per day, will be swimming in temperatures of around 20- 30 degrees battling currents of 1- 7 knots. The father, who gave up his full-time study of psychology to take up the challenge, will wear a special suit to protect him from the harsh Equatorial sun as well as any creatures he may encounter - potentially including jelly fish and even sharks. The father of Georgia, five, told MailOnline today he was pushed into taking up the epic challenge following a difficult year in 2013. Mr Hooper said: 'The swim is an idea I have been sitting on for a long time. 'I have long been fascinated with the ocean and its wildlife and have always been sporty and fit and thought ""now is the time"". The route Mr Hooper will take - hopefully crossing over 2,000 miles in around two months . 'I was feeling really uninspired last year and was finding it difficult to do anything. I needed a change and to do something different - so I thought ""why not now."" 'I left my job and started assembling my team around me. I have always been fit and done a few triathlons and other events - but obviously a challenge of this scale needs professional assistance. 'Training has been really tough - but it's my full-time job. 'I hope to be back on dry land by New Year's Eve - I will be helped along by the sea and should be going at around 4.5 knots.' Mr Hooper, who lives with his daughter and partner Kate Lewington, 39, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, has been training for over a year - starting with daily swims of about 4-7miles for five-months. At the start of this year, he moved out in to open water - training in the Mediterranean Ocean and aiming to cover 2.8million meters of swimming, about 115,000 lengths of a 25m pool, by November. The father says what makes his trip different is the fact the entire adventure will be streamed online - thanks to new technology by SmackDab. This means viewers will be able to watch every second of his trip will be shown on the trip's official Facebook page. Mr Hooper training in open water at the end of 2013. It is thought he will consume about 12,000 calories per day while on his epic adventure . The swimmer, pictured in open water training at the end of 2013, will take rest breaks aboard a support boat - which will accompany him on the trip . Earlier in the year, Mr Hooper also announced he would be working with Ridgeline Entertainment - who have created a number of action documentaries such as Discovery Channel's The Deadliest Catch. The company will be filming throughout the trip to create a documentary of the adventure which will then be shown on television. According to his website, Mr Hooper will be the first man in history to have swum an ocean in full. It adds he will be the first man to explicitly and transparently detail his swim - swimming the exact mileage of the intended crossing. However, others claim they were in fact the first - including American Jennifer Figge who was hailed as the first woman to complete the challenge in 2009.  However, most now regard her expedition as a failed attempt. Mr Hooper ahead of a practice swim. The swimmer's journey will be made into a documentary on completion . Benoît Lecomte also received wide credit for being the first man to swim across the Atlantic Ocean without a kick board in 1998. The 3,716-mile journey took 73 days - and he was accompanied by a 40ft sailboat complete with electromagnetic field to ward off shark attacks. Mr Hooper said today: 'I don't want to take anything away from others who say they're swum the Atlantic. But what makes my trip different is that it is transparent. 'Thanks to amazing technology, people will be able to watch every minute of my trip online.' He will be raising money for three charities: SOS Children, which provides orphans and vulnerable children with a stable and positive family life, Maggie’s Cancer Care Centre in Cheltenham, and Addaction - a leading drug and alcohol charity.

"By . Daniel Mills . Fire crews aided by ambulance staff assisted in the removal of the 320kg woman . Emergency crews have undergone a carefully planned removal of a 320kg New Zealand woman from the bedroom of her home where she spent years growing heavier until she 'couldn't move hardly at all.' Carpenters and fire crews spent up to two hours  disassembling a large window of the woman's Canterbury home, where she lived with her 82-year-old father, before hoisting her and the mattress she laid on onto a loader and into a waiting ambulance outside. It took two hours in total from the start of the 9am operation on Thursday, to transfer the 54-year-old out and take her to Christchurch Hospital where eight firemen, aided by several ambulance and hospital staff, carried her inside. A St John Ambulance spokesman said the woman's life was not in immediate danger nor was it an emergency rescue - but a carefully planned procedure at the request of the family. The most difficult part of the operation was figuring out the best way of exiting her from the house, after efforts to remove the 54-year-old through the front sliding door failed because she didn't fit. The father of the woman told stuff.co.nz his daughter ate 'normal' food but had grown heavier during the past eight years. The woman was transferred to Christchurch Hospital after a two hour procedure . She was housebound, unable to work or drive and 'couldn't move hardly at all,' the father said. She lived in a flat behind his house, but he cooked for her and helped her clean. He described his daughter, who spent a lot of time playing the computer, as 'a large girl.' 'She couldn't leave the house,' he said. Her GP had urged her to lose weight but had not diagnosed the condition. He said she would be tested for Lymphedema at Christchurch Hospital, a condition that increases a person's weight because of an inability of fluids inside the lymph nodes to drain properly. More...

Thousands more to get obesity ops on the NHS: NICE calls for huge increase in surgery - but even obesity charities condemn it . NZ Fire Service's Christchurch assistant area commander, Greg Crawford, whose staff where involved in the transfer, told Daily Mail Australia his crew had assisted in 'human lifts of over 200kg all the time' but admitted this was the heaviest woman he could recall ever having to move. 'The father passed a comment that this woman was getting fairly big - which is probably the understatement of the year,' Mr Crawford said. 'Lifts similar to this are common practice, but I imagine this would be the biggest lift, certainly the biggest lift I can recall ... 320kg is fairly chunky.' Operations such as this were known to create minor injuries for the staff involved, in particular, back and leg strains from the overbearing weight. He said firefighters had about one call-out a month to help ambulance staff lift someone who was obese and two firefighters had recently sustained minor back strains from doing so. The central city rescue truck carried a purpose-built lifting sheet with handles ""for that very reason"", Crawford said. A St John Ambulance spokesperson has declined to comment citing privacy reasons while a comment is still being sought from Christchurch Hospital.","The obese was removed from her house and placed into a waiting ambulance .

The News Corp boss, 83, is just one of a bevy of billionaires at the media, finance and technology conference which has gained an almost mythical reputation for being an event where massive deals and mergers are struck. Other guests include Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter's Dick Costolo, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and former New York mayor Micheal Bloomberg. Lachlan Murdoch hangs onto the back of a golf cart as he hand his media magnate father Rupert Murdoch are driven through the exclusive Sun Valley Resort on the third day of the Allen & Company conference . News Corp Boss Rupert Murdoch is joined by son  Lachlan, left, and daughter-in-law Sarah at the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho . Mr Murdoch appeared to be enjoying the sunshine as walked around the upscale Idaho mountain resort before hitching a ride on a golf cart. Murdoch, the CEO of News Corporation and 21st Century Fox, the world’s second biggest media company, is rumoured to be considering a buyout of Time Warner. Time Warner’s chief Jeffrey Bewkes was on hand to talk to Mr Murdoch at the conference which is known as the ‘summer camp for billionaires'. The week long event, which is now in its 32nd year, is attended by many of the worlds wealthiest and most powerful executives from media, finance, and technology. Media and technology CEOs and investors get together every year at the Allen & Co conference in Sun Valley for a week of mingling and deal-making. James Murdoch, left, joined his siblings and father, right, for a day at the conference which has a reputation for being an event at which huge deals are struck between some of America's biggest companies . Microsoft founder Bill Gates and his wife Melinda are representing the  Gates Foundation at the conference, in Sun Valley, Idaho . This year, one of the more-debated . topics was retired General Stanley McChrystal's push for a national . service program for American teens, according to one prominent Sun . Valley regular who sat in on a panel discussion. McChrystal, former Commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, runs a pro-public service organization called the Franklin Project that counts Condoleezza Rice and Barbara Bush among its supporters, according to its website. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg is among the many billionaires at the conference . He made headlines in 2010, stepping down after Rolling Stone ran an article entitled 'The Runaway General,' quoting members of McChrystal's staff disparaging top White House officials and allies. At the conference this week, he told his high-flying audience about the concept of a 'service year,' where youths sign up for a year of service in a variety of fields like education and conservation, and receive a modest stipend. McChrystal has previously laid out plans for the initiative at conferences. He described national service as the 'big idea for our time' in a recent opinion piece for Politico. NBC News' Tom Brokaw also interviewed McChrystal at the conference, two attendees said. Brokaw has previously talked about public service academies modeled on U.S. military academies. Another hot issue at the conference? Many of the morning's panels featured education as their theme. Sun Valley regular Jeff Weiner, chief executive of LinkedIn, has tweeted in favor of Code.org. Fellow guests, including Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Dropbox's Drew Houston, have spoken out publicly in favor of Code.org's mission to bring computer science education to schools across America. The sources asked not to be named because the sessions are kept secret.","Murdoch joined by sons James and Lachlan and daughter-in-law Sarah .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Massachusetts man who has been responsible for a staggering 10 other car wrecks is in jail on vehicular homicide and other charges in the June death of a 20-year-old jogger. Haley Cremer had stopped to chat with a friend on the sidewalk when she was hit and killed by a speeding SUV allegedly driven by 44-year-old Jeffrey Bickoff. Bickoff was arraigned in Stoughton District Court Wednesday for the June 4 death of Haley Cremer, a student at Simmons College in Sharon, about 20 miles south of Boston. At the arraignment, Assistant District Attorney Debi Curley described how Bickoff's speeding Ford Explorer drove across a lane marker near the intersection of Hampton and Dogwood roads in Sharon and then 'struck and catapulted Haley 78 feet to her death' as she had stopped jogging to talk with a friend. Tragic: 20-year-old Haley Cremer was struck by an SUV allegedly driven by 44-year-old Jeffrey Bickoff . Excited: Cremer was a good student who just finished her sophomore year of college and was looking forward to starting her summer job at Lululemon . Responsible: Jeffrey Bickoff has been responsible for at least 10 vehicle collisions prior to allegedly hitting Cremer . Curley also says that Bickoff had consumed three liquor drinks before getting behind the wheel and that he should have been able to see Cremer before he hit her from a distance that is nearly the length of a football field. 'He drives between 45 and 50 miles an hour, claiming he wasn’t texting, . claiming he didn’t drop a cigarette, claiming that he wasn’t distracted, . yet we know that for 290 feet the defendant had visibility,' Curley . said, the Boston Globe reports. 'Yet he drove over the right fog lane onto a raised curb and . struck and catapulted Haley some 78 feet to her death — although he lost . the privilege of driving when his license was suspended,' she continued. In addition to the vehicular homicide, Bickoff also is charged with speeding, driving with a suspended license, and committing a marked lane violation. In addition to the 10 previous accidents, Bickoff also has nine speeding tickets on his driving record, the Globe reports. Bail: Bickoff's attorney says he is indigent and can't afford the $10,000 bail a judge is requiring to free him from custody as he awaits trial . Responsibility: Bickoff's attorney says his client is cooperating with police and that he feels horrible about what happened . Visibility: Prosecutors say Bickoff should have been able to see Cremer from 290 feet away before he allegedly hit her at this intersection . Judge Richard D. Savignano set Bickoff's bail at $10,000 cash and set a pretrial hearing for August 8. The paper reports that Bickoff's attorney says his client is indigent and it is unlikely he will be able to afford to bail himself out of jail. 'He took full responsibility and is just devastated by the whole situation,' Bickoff's court appointed attorney, Richard Comenzo told the paper. Cremer had just moved into an apartment in Sharon. Her uncle she was a good student and was excited about her summer job at Lululemon. 'This is a young woman who was undoubtedly going to make a remarkable . wife, a remarkable mother, and to have that taken away in such a . senseless, stupid loss, it shakes the boundaries of my faith,' her . uncle, Steve Litner, told the paper.

"By . Scarlett Russell . With the much-anticipated final on Sunday, World Cup excitement is reaching fever pitch. Now new survey has looked at 30 countries to see which nationalities are winning in the bedroom – even if they’re losing on the pitch. Leaving no question out of bounds, 35,000 21 -55 year-olds around the globe were quizzed on their sexual habits. Foul play: A survey by luxury sex toy brand LELO quizzed 35,000 21 -55 year-olds all over the world on their sex lives . Overall, 79 percent of the world’s population say they are satisfied with their sex lives and the global average for foreplay and intercourse is 32.5 minutes. The majority, some 55 per cent, has had one to eight sexual partners. The English and Greek can console themselves for their lack of footballing success with the knowledge that they are happiest with their sex lives - almost a quarter claim to be completely satisfied in bed. They’re followed closely by Japan in third, while Chile trails the pack, with just 13 per cent Only 13 being fully satisfied. The Brazilians have the most stamina, with more than 34 per cent claiming to last 46 minutes or more. In . Japan, half the population has slept with three partners or fewer and more than 45 per cent of the population last no more than 20 . minutes. Australia holds the record for quickest to score with . 10 per cent of the population calling match time within 10 minutes. Players: Does England's Steven Gerrard, left, score as well off the pitch? English people rate themselves 'moderate or above' in bed. Meanwhile, Brazil's David Luiz may have something to not cry about, as Brazilians are reported to have the most stamina in bed . 26 per cent of people in Switzerland claim to have slept with 20 people or more, followed closely by Greece with 25 per cent. In England, one in five have bedded more than 20 people. And as well as keepy uppies and tackling, if there’s one thing some footballers are adept in, it’s playing away. Playful: 94 per cent of English people surveyed having used or owned a sex toy . In the survey, France emerged as champion sex cheats, with 75 per cent of people admitting to have strayed . away from their partners. Latin American countries follow closely behind, with almost half the populations of Colombia, Brazil and Chile admitting to cheating too. And if your partner is Belgian or Australian, you're in luck, as these nationalities appear to cheat the least. When asked if they cheat because they’re unsatisfied – or are they just tired of faking it, half of all sexually active adults worldwide have faked it at least once. Latin Americans are the biggest fakers with 70 per cent of Colombians admitting to faking it, followed closely by Chile and Brazil. Portugal and Greece fake the least, said the survey. The Dutch are the most modest, with just six per cent ranking themselves as experts. The majority of English people rank themselves as ‘moderate’ or ‘above’. The Greeks, followed closely by the Italians and the Brazilians, rate themselves more than any other countries as experts when it comes to the art of love. And it turns out football isn’t the only significant game, as a large number of countries admitted to owning sex toys. Sex toy usage is increasing globally, but England win by far as more than 94 per cent of survey participants having used or owned a sex toy. Four percent of those in both England and the Netherlands admit to owning a jaw-dropping 16 or more pleasure objects. Chile comes last with more than half the population saying their toy box is empty.","The global average for foreplay and intercourse is 32.5 minutes .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Repeating her vows in front of loved ones, Lisa Parcel promised to love and honour her new husband. But the 27-year-old had already made one more unconventional yet priceless promise, to donate one of her kidneys to the man standing before her at the alter. Lee Parcel was battling kidney failure when the couple tied the knot a year ago. His devoted partner of 14 years was ready to donate one of her organs, just as soon as doctors said the 33-year-old was well enough for a transplant operation. But time ran out and Mr Parcel passed away before his wife had the chance to fulfill her life-saving promise, donating his own organs to help save the lives of three others awaiting transplants. Lee Parcel passed away with his wife Lisa by his side, before she could donate one of her kidneys to him as a wedding gift . Mrs Parcel said: 'I'm heartbroken but I am a very lucky girl to be able to say I was his wife. 'He was an inspiration to us all. It was so hard kissing you goodbye.' The couple had been together for 14 years before Mr Parcel proposed to the 'love of his life', just before he fell ill three years ago. The diabetic was diagnosed with serious kidney failure, placed on an emergency dialysis treatment programme and warned he needed a transplant if he was to survive. When Mrs Parcel was found to be a match for her then fiancee, the couple could not believe their luck. The 27-year-old told her husband-to-be she would give him the 'ultimate wedding present'. At the time, Mr Parcel said: 'There is nothing I can say or do to thank my wife for a new life - there's no repayment for that. 'What Lisa is doing isn’t just giving me a kidney. It’s a massive operation and comes with a lot of psychological issues. It’s not an easy process for the donor or recipient to endure. 'But she knows how much I appreciate it because she sees what I go through every day, or should I say what we go through every day. 'All we can do is be there for each other.' The couple, from Cardiff, got married in June last year, while Mr Parcel was having daily dialysis. Three years ago Mr Parcel, a diabetic, was diagnosed with serious kidney failure. He was put on emergency, daily dialysis and doctors warned he would need a transplant in order to survive . He passed away with his wife Lisa by his side less than a year after they married last June. He donated his organs to help save the lives of three others waiting for transplant operations . They had hoped to have the transplant operations six months later, and had plans to travel around the world when they had both recovered. But complications with Mr Parcel's health prevented doctors from beginning the transplant preparation process. Mr Parcel's condition deteriorated rapidly and he died with his wife at his bedside in intensive care at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital, near Llantrisant in South Wales. 'I'm heartbroken but so lucky to have been his wife' - Lisa Parcel . Just four days before his death Mr Parcel posted a poignant last message on Facebook: 'It’s such a cruel world.' Knowing better than most the vital importance of donors, Mr Parcel had arranged for his organs to be donated following his death. His wife, Mrs Parcel, a mental health nurse, said: 'After he died Lee had an operation to donate his organs to three people who need them. 'Lee was so strong and brave throughout his life. 'I can only hope we can muster up a tiny bit of strength to get us through this.'

"Is obesity a disability or a self-inflicted condition triggered by a lack of willpower and overeating? And should people who are overweight be protected by the same discrimination laws that were put in place to shield those who are wheel-chair bound, people with learning difficulties, hearing and visual impairments or those with autism spectrum disorders? A landmark test case being brought before judges at the European Court of Justice today has sparked a vigorous debate on the issue. The result of it may mean British companies will have to treat obese workers as 'disabled', making allowances for their size by providing larger seats and parking spaces closer to the office. A landmark test case is being brought before judges at the European Court of Justice today by Karsten Kaltoft, pictured, which could result in obesity being classed as a disability for employers in the UK . Mr Kaltoft was sacked by his local authority in Denmark for being unable to perform his duties as a childminder because of his 25 stone size . Karsten Kaltoft is taking action after he was sacked by his local authority in Denmark for being unable to perform his duties as a childminder, due to his size. The council, Billund Kommune, claimed the 25 stone childminder was so fat that he required help from a colleague to tie up children's shoelaces. If successful in redefining obesity as a disability, Mr Kaltoft's lawyers could force widespread changes in the way bosses deal with staff. Currently in the UK the law is clear, the Equality Act 2010 refrained from classing obesity as a disability. Instead the Government definition is that a person is 'disabled under the Equality Act 2010, if they have a physical or mental impairment that has a 'substantial' and 'long-term' negative effect on a person's ability to do normal daily activities.' However for many people living with a disability, they self-define themselves as such, basing their disability more on the barriers society puts in the way of them leading the life they wish. For someone bound to a wheelchair steps to a cinema or restaurant, can provide a barrier and as a result a person is likely to class themselves as disabled. Debating the issue on today's Good Morning Britain, writer and broadcaster Carole Malone and journalist Ursula Hirschkorn, explored both sides of the issue. Ms Hirschkorn said: 'I am not sure it (obesity) should be treated as a disabilty. 'But what he is trying to say is if you are going to have anti-discrimination laws, they need to be universal. 'Should it distinguish between what employees you are going to protect and those you are not going to protect? Journalist Ursula Hirschkorn (left) and broadcaster and writer Carole Malone (right) debated this issue on today's Good Morning Britain . 'It is not about saying if I am fat I am disabled, rather it is about if I can't do my job because I am fat, I deserve the same protection as someone who can't do their job because they are disabled, or pregnant.' But journalist and writer Ms Malone argued obesity is not a disability, rather a self-inflicted condition brought on by people who cannot resist the urge to eat. When asked whether people should be protected by anti-discrimination laws because they are obese, she said: 'Not in the case of people who self-inflict their disability. 'In the case of this Danish guy, he was 25st. All he needed to do was eat less doughnuts and less Danish pastries and he would have been able to bend down and tie the children's shoe laces. Ms Malone argued in '95 per cent of cases' obesity is self-inflicted 'by people lacking discipline and self-control' 'But because he didn't, he couldn't. And clearly is literally not fit enough to look after those kids. 'If you can't bend down to tie your shoe lace you can't help them if they fall down, you can't react quickly enough if something happens. 'That man was clearly not suited to that job.' Challenging Ms Malone's suggestion that 'obesity is self-inflicted in 95 per cent of cases', Ms Hirschkorn branded the statement 'unfair'. She said: 'At the end of the day if you are completely drunk and take a dive into a shallow swimming pool and end up disabled, that is self-inflicted. 'I am not saying that person should not be protected but equally you don't know why people become fat, the vast majority of people become fat because they have psychological issues or health problems.' Ms Malone responded: 'That is simply not true. We are both, I would say, a bit overweight (to which Ms Hirschkorn agreed). There is no disability, no psychological problem, I am overweight. 'The majority of people who are overweight have psychological problems, no they don't. The majority of people who are overweight have no discipline and no self-control.' She added: 'The Equality Act 2010 ruled that obesity is not a disability. 'What is going to happen if this court ruling happens, it is going to punish people who are overweight because employers will not employ fat people, or people they think might get fat. 'Why should you get special treatment if you have abused your body knowingly - that is what a lot of obese people do. 'People generally get fat, in 95 per cent of cases, because they eat too much.' Disability charity Scope asked users and supporters for their views on the debate, via Twitter and Facebook, yesterday. The overwhelming response from members of the public was that obesity should not be classed as a disability.","Landmark test case will be heard at European Court of Justice today .

"By . Julian Robinson . A brave young woman has posted a no make-up 'selfie' online - to show the true extent of the birthmark on her face. Amy Elsegood, from Ripon, North Yorkshire, was determined to show people who she really was, posting the image on the internet. The pretty 22-year-old has worn special make-up from the NHS since she was 11, helping her conceal the port wine stain on her right cheek. Scroll down for video . Amy Elsegood received support form around the world after she bravely posted a selfie of her birthmark, left,  on Facebook. Pictured right, she used to use special make up to conceal her port wine stain . Having put the picture on Facebook, she is receiving messages of support from people around the world. Miss Elsegood said: 'I wore it [the make-up] every time I left the house as I was too self-conscious to go out without hiding my birthmark first. 'But then one day I just thought, ""you were born like this, there is no reason to be ashamed,"" so I posted a no make-up selfie. 'No-one could say anything negative that I haven’t heard before. 'The reaction on Facebook was amazing, I had over 600 likes with people all over the world messaging me, it was surreal.' Although . she had laser surgery from birth until the age of 10, Miss Elsegood decided . that it was no longer necessary, hating the procedure. She . added: 'Laser treatment tends to work best when you’re young, making it . less effective as I got older, but I know that without it that my . birthmark would be a lot redder than it is now. Despite the positive response Amy Elsegood has had to her no make-up selfie, she has been the target of bullies throughout her life . The 22-year-old used to be 'too self-conscious' to go out without hiding her birthmark first. She had laser surgery from her birth until she was ten. She is pPictured right as a child with her father . 'I . would probably think about having it again now that I’m older but with . my cosmetic make-up I’m able to conceal my birthmark well anyway.' Despite . the positive response she has had to her no make-up selfie online, she . has been a target for bullies throughout her life. Miss Elsegood, said: 'I was about four years old when I realised I was different. Port-wine stains are red or purple marks that often appear on the face but which can affect any area of skin. They are caused by abnormal blood vessels and are most commonly present from birth. According to patient.co.uk, about three in 1,000 babies are born with a port-wine stain - but they are not hereditary. They vary in size and can if left untreated tend to get darker over the years. A number of treatments have been tried including using laser and other light sources to reduce the redness of stains. 'Other kids would point at me, call me ‘blob face’ and say that I was ugly. 'I even had one woman come up to me on holiday to say that I would’ve been pretty if it wasn’t for my birthmark.' When she became a teenager she thought she would find it difficult to find a boyfriend. She added: 'I was so embarrassed by my port wine stain that I never thought anyone would accept me for who I was. 'But then I met Josh at 16, he was the same age but from a different school. 'The first time I met him I was wearing make-up to conceal what was underneath but after a few weeks into our relationship I wanted to show him the real me. 'I decided . to meet him with no make-up on, I said ""this is what I really look . like,"" but he simply replied with ""it makes no difference to me."" 'We’ve been together for six years now.' However, Miss Elsegood still felt self-conscious when leaving the house and did not go anywhere without wearing her cover-up. When Miss Elsegood, right, became a teenager she thought she would find it difficult to find a boyfriend - but then she met Josh, pictured left . Since posting her selfie online Miss Elsegood, pictured on holiday says she has gained confidence - and hopes the initiative will inspire others in a similar position . She said: 'It wasn’t until the cancer research no make-up selfie came about that I really accepted who I was. 'My birthmark doesn’t need to define me and no-one should be ashamed to show who they really are. 'Since posting my selfie online I have gained so much confidence, it’s been great helping others who are in a similar position too. 'I’ve learnt that there are much worse things to have in life and I’ve accepted me for me.' Cheryl Cole joined the make-up free selfie trend by posting a picture of herself on Instagram . Amy Elsegood had her own reasons for posting a no make-up picture online. But the craze of taking bare-faced selfies and posting them on the internet has swept the online world this year - and raised millions for charity. The idea took off in March after huge numbers of women posted pictures of themselves wearing no make-up on social media websites - then nominated their friends to do the same. In a matter of days the campaign had raised more than £8million for Cancer Research UK. Among those to take part were a host of celebrities, including Prince Harry's ex-girlfriend Cressida Bonas, X-Factor judge Cheryl Cole, actresses Michelle Keegan and Helen Flanagan. Michelle Heaton, Holly Willoughby and Kym Marsh also ditched make-up to show their natural beauty in their own bare-faced pictures. At the time, Cancer Research UK said the donations would allow the charity to carry out 10 clinical trials that would not previously have been possible because of funding restrictions.","Amy Elsegood posted 'selfie' to show true extent of her birthmark .

"By . Julian Robinson . A pensioner has hit out at the NHS for 'allowing' his leg to balloon to an enormous two-and-a-half stone. Michael Cull, from Fraserburgh in Aberdeenshire, can hardly walk because of the weight of the massive limb, which is almost two foot wider than his right leg - and is getting bigger every day. The 66-year-old former Nasa computer technician is thought to be the only person in Scotland to suffer from elephantiasis - a disease found mainly in the tropics. His left leg is so wide he needs to have . trousers specially made for him, his shoes only last a fortnight because . the soles wear out, and every time he steps outside he is called names . like 'Elephant Man'. Pensioner Michael Cull  thought to be the only person in Scotland to suffer from elephantiasis - a disease found mainly in tropical countries . He can't even board a plane because the seating space is too narrow for his 20 inch leg. Mr Cull said his life has been ruined and claims he has been severely let down by the NHS for allowing his condition to get to this stage. The NHS has urged Mr Cull to speak to his GP. But he said: 'The last six years of my life have been totally destroyed. I’ve had about 20 [hospital] referrals and no doctor seems to know what to do or even wants to know. 'I’ve had no treatment, no drastic operation, no antibiotics, nothing. The whole system has failed me. 'It is swelling more every day and I’m worried there is a risk I will be left in a wheelchair or need it amputated if I don’t get treatment soon.' Mr Cull first noticed swelling in his knee after he was knocked down by a car on a pedestrian crossing in London 10 years ago. At . first doctors thought the swelling resembled a sports injury, but his . leg never improved and over six years it started to grow to enormous . proportions. He . was then diagnosed with lymphedema, which cases fluid to build up in . the arms and legs, but after repeated trips to his GP surgery, doctors . realised it was far more serious. Simple tasks such as climbing the stairs and having a bath have become major challenges for Michael Cull, pictured. He also had to give up his work due to health and safety fears as a result of his condition . It was only after seeing a specialist in Dundee last year that it was suggested he had elephantiasis. But with no mention of treatment, frustrated Mr Cull, went to see a private consultant, paid for by a friend, who recommended reduction surgery, which would involve cutting away the leg tissue and rebuilding it using skin grafts. As it was private appointment, however, Mr Cull claims doctors on the NHS have refused to act on it. He said: 'It seems like nobody knows what’s going on. There has been a lot of miss-communication and miss-information all the way along. It’s upside-down chaos.' Mr Cull’s leg is four times the size of the other and the swelling is starting to spread to his pelvis. As a result simple tasks like climbing stairs, having a bath and cooking are a major challenge. He cannot drive and when he takes the bus or train he needs to sit in the disabled area as there is more room. Mr Cull, who repaired telescopes for the Nasa space programme and worked on various classified military aircraft until he was forced to give up work for health and safety fears. Mr Cull has to fork out hundreds of pounds a year on trousers and shoes and as his leg is so severely disfigured, due to the extensive swelling, every time he steps outside people stop and stare and shout abuse at him. Pensioner Michael Cull is thought to be the only person in Scotland to suffer from elephantiasis - a disease found mainly in tropical countries . He said: 'People call me all sorts of things, like Elephant Man. It makes me really depressed. 'My trousers ride up when I walk so there is no way I can hide it. It affects my leg, foot, and toes. I can’t wear socks because I can’t get them on. Nothing will fit me.' Mr Cull has now written to various high profile figures in the NHS demanding an investigation. He has even looked into funding the operation himself in India - but he cannot afford the £10,000 procedure. 'I’m a pensioner. I don’t have that sort of money and why should I pay for it abroad? I’ve been paying into the system here since I was 14.' One of the best known people with the condition was Joseph Merrick, known as the Elephant man . Elephantiasis is normally caused by a . parasite from a mosquito bite and is usually found in tropical parts of . the world, like India or the Amazon, where Mr Cull grew up. It is characterised by massive enlargement of an area of the body and is caused by the obstruction of the lymphatic system. This results in the accumulation of fluids in the affected part of the body. According to the World Health Organisation, nearly 1.4billion people in 73 countries worldwide are threatened by the condition, which is also known as lymphatic filariasis. WHO figures suggest that approximately 80 per cent of these people are living in Bangladesh, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nigeria, Nepal, Philippines and the United Republic of Tanzania. Over 120million people are currently infected, with about 40 million disfigured and incapacitated by the disease, the organisation claims. The most famous person to suffer from a form of elephantiasis was Joseph Merrick, better known as the Elephant Man. In 1884, after four years in a workhouse, Merrick contacted a showman and proposed that he should exhibit him. His managers then named him Elephant Man and he was eventually sent on a tour of Europe. He returned to Britain and became well known in London society after he went to live at the London Hospital. Merrick died in 1890, aged 27. It is reported he died from a dislocated neck when he lay down to sleep, because of the huge weight of his head. Elephantiasis is normally caused by a parasite from a mosquito bite and is usually found in tropical parts of the world, like India or the Amazon, where Mr Cull grew up. It is thought that it may have lain dormant in his body for 50 years before he was hit by the car. A spokeswoman for NHS Grampian said they were unable to comment on individual cases. But she added: 'We would urge Mr Cull to get in touch with his GP surgery. His practice have said they would be happy to discuss matters with him.'

"By . Lizzie Parry . They have been married for 45 years but still Malcolm Cowen struggles to recognise his own wife in a crowded room. The 67-year-old was born with the rare condition prosopagnosia or 'face-blindness', which means he is unable to recognise faces. The computer-programmer from Manchester has spent his life developing various strategies to help him handle social situations. Mr Cowen, who cannot pick out his own face in the mirror and likens his condition to dyslexia, said he has learned the clothes his wife wears and picks out his grandchildren, according to their ages. Grandfather Malcolm Cowen was born with a rare condition prosopagnosia or 'face-blindness', which means he cannot recognise people's faces, including his own in the mirror and that of his 66-year-old wife Beryl (left) 'I can’t recognise my own face in the mirror, I can’t recognise faces in pictures and I can’t recognise even my own wife’s face,' he said. 'All I know is a face is a thing at the top of the body. 'Most people can see individual people in that thing called a face - but I simply cannot. 'If a normal person is shown two photographs and asked if they are the same individual, most people would instantly say yes or no. 'But I have to start scanning to match an ear with an ear or a nose with a nose and make a guess from each of these features. 'Most people can also spot someone when shown a front picture of the face and a profile – however when I’m shown a picture from the front and profile I can’t match the features so I’m totally lost. 'The easiest way for me to explain the condition to people is to describe it as like having dyslexia for faces. 'In a similar way to how a dyslexic-person has problems seeing words made up of letters I have problems seeing a face which is made-up of features.' Mr Cowen has spent his life developing various strategies to help him handle social situations, and can only spot his wife of 45 years by recognising her clothes and hairstyle . Face-blindness is often caused by a stroke or injury to the brain – however in rare cases such as Mr Cowen's it can be inherited. As well as failing to spot members of this family in the street, Mr Cowen also struggles to follow the plot of television shows, failing to spot characters. Even famous faces in magazines and newspapers leave the 67-year-old baffled. The condition is so rare that it was little-understood until recently. It is thought to be caused by a problem with the part of the brain called the fusiform gyrus, which is responsible for face recognition. Despite his condition, Mr Cowen studied maths at Nottingham University and went on to write software for computers. It was there he met the woman he would marry, fellow Nottingham University student, Beryl. 'When I first met Malcolm’s family I was the one who had to explain to him who everyone was,' the 66-year-old said. 'I had to introduce myself and then get their names from them so he knew who was who. 'The funny thing was Malcolm’s family was large with lots of uncles, cousins and in-laws so it was confusing for him. 'I knew then that there was something very special about Malcolm.' With the help of his wife, who acts as his minder at parties, community meetings and family gatherings – Mr Cowen has raised three sons and six grandchildren. 'Even after 45-years of marriage Malcolm can only recognise me by my hair, my clothes and as he puts it – by the way I move,' she said. 'So for the past 40-years I’ve had to keep my old short-perm hair-do and same style clothes, which does feel like being in a bit of a fashion time-warp. 'Once, Malcolm was being presented with an award in London for his work, so I treated myself to a new hair-do. 'Of course when I arrived outside the venue, Malcolm walked straight past me like I wasn’t here. 'But he’s always joking that he doesn’t have strange women showing up at the door too often, so he’s not likely to let anyone in he’s not supposed to.' Mr Cowen said he is lucky his grandchildren - Jemma, 17, Shinea, 16, Beverly, 13, Dylan, four, Merissa three, and Erin, one - all are either different ages or have different colour hair, allowing him to guess who they are. The father-of-six has learned to spot his grandchildren, distinguishing them by age. The couple are pictured with their granddaughter Beverly, 13 . Prosopagnosia is a neurological disorder characterised by the inability to recognise people's faces. Also known as 'face-blindness', the severity of the condition depends on the degree of impairment a person suffers. Some people with prosopagnosia may only struggle to recognise a familiar face, while others will be unable to discriminate between unknown faces, and in more severe cases sufferers cannot distinguish a face as being different from an object. As in Mr Cowen's case, some sufferers are unable to recognise their own faces. The condition is not related to memory loss, impaired vision or learning disabilities. It is thought to be the result of abnormalities, damage, or impairment in the right fusiform gyrus - a fold in the brain that appears to coordinate facial perception and memory. Prosopagnosia can result from stroke, traumatic brain injury, or some neurodegenerative diseases. In some cases the condition is congenital, and present at birth. It appears to run in families, which makes it likely to be the result of a genetic mutation or deletion. Some degree of prosopagnosia is often found in children with autism and Asperger's Syndrome. Treatment of the condition focuses on helping sufferers develop compensatory strategies, including relying on voice recognition, clothing, or unique physical attributes. Source: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke . However, when they are around other children it becomes confusing, he added. 'There was a funny moment when my eldest grand-daughter Jemma decided to play a prank on me,' said Mr Cowen. 'She has red hair but there were other children with red hair also. Her friends saw that I couldn’t tell whether or not it was her. 'Then she turned round and grinned at me, and I knew it was her. This was her little joke to prove to her friends that I do have a condition. 'At children’s parties where lots of kids are around I tend to play with them all. I just have to do my best to keep track of my own grandchildren.' As well as haircuts, distinctive features, footwear, speech and movement, Mr Cowen uses other tricks to lead a normal life. 'I use clothes and shoes to tell people apart,' he said. 'Women can be easier than men, but they do have the annoying habit of wearing different clothes each day, which means I do lose track of them.' For most of his life, Mr Cowen did not realise face blindness existed, so it was impossible for him to explain why he could not recognise people he had already met. But since his diagnosis by the Manchester Royal Infirmary, he finds by being up-front and open about his face-blindness that he can finally enjoy a relaxed social-life. 'I am active in meetings with the council as well as in the community through amateur dramatics and in my local church,' he said. 'At meetings where I know people is fine, but I’ll draw a diagram of where everyone is sitting. 'Now I tell people about my face-blindness up-front so they introduce themselves when they see me. 'Most people understand if it’s explained to them properly. 'And I have Beryl with me usually. She does a wonderful job of saying people’s names aloud while we are meeting them. 'Now I treat my face-blindness as a thing to laugh about not a something to get het up about. 'This means no-one need gets embarrassed, especially not me.'","Malcolm Cowen has the rare condition prosopagnosia or 'face-blindness'

"By . Lizzie Parry . A young traveller with undiagnosed Crohn's disease woke following an emergency operation to discover part of her bowel had been removed. Jessica Weatherby had just arrived in New Zealand when she contracted blood poisoning when the disease caused part of her bowel to perforate, causing the contents of her intestinal tract to spill into her abdomen. The 23-year-old today told of her shock at waking from surgery to discover an ileostomy bag fitted to her stomach, in place of her missing bowel. Miss Weatherby is now back at home and is learning to live with her life-changing diagnosis. Jessica Weatherby, 23, woke up from an emergency operation in New Zealand in March, to discover she had an ileostomy bag fitted, after surgeons were forced to remove part of her bowel . She is one of thousands of young people . in the UK with the condition, as figures from the Health and Social Care . Information Centre reveal the number of cases in 16 to 29-year-old's . has rocketed by almost 300 per cent in the last 10 years. She said: 'Getting used to having an . ileostomy at the age of 23 was a shock. 'My body has changed in an . unexpected way and it’s not something you can easily get used to. 'There . needs to be more awareness about Crohn’s. 'In many ways it’s a young . person’s disease, because it affects so many children. 'I . try not to let the diagnosis change my life. It’s frustrating to not be . able to work while I recover, and it’s important for me to keep busy. 'There is a routine I have to follow - I take around 20 tablets a day and I need to make sure I’m properly stocked with bags.' Recalling the moment she woke with the ileostomy bag, she said: 'I'd taken myself to the accident and . emergency department of the local hospital, where I'd been put on . medication to help me cope with the pain. 'A . nurse came over and put a mark on my stomach, and mentioned that I . would have to have an ileostomy. I was delirious so didn’t quite . appreciate what that meant. 'I . woke up after the operation, which removed part of my intestine. The . enormity of what had happened didn’t quite sink in until I had left . hospital.' In March, Miss Weatherby, a former sales assistant, travelled 11,000 miles to New Zealand with her boyfriend James Broadbent, 20. The pair intended to find work and live on the other side of the world for a year. But their dreams of adventure were shattered just hours after they touched down in Auckland. Miss . Weatherby, said: 'I’d been suffering nausea, diarrhoea and insomnia for . a few weeks before I flew out, but I’d had blood tests and was given . the all-clear. The 23-year-old was travelling with her boyfriend, James Broadbent, 20, when she fell ill just days after they arrived in Auckland . Crohn's disease is an incurable and lifelong condition which causes inflammation of part of the bowel . The number of young people admitted . to hospital with Crohn's disease has soared almost 300 per cent in the . last 10 years, the BBC reported today. The Health and Social Care Information Centre said 4,937 16 to 29-year-olds were admitted for treatment in England in 2003/04. Last year that number rose to 19,405. Experts say junk food and too many antibiotics could be behind the rise. Dr . Sally Mitton says she and her colleagues at St George's Hospital in . Tooting, south-west London, have seen a rise in the number of young . people with Crohn's. 'We try to keep patients fit enough so they . can stay at home but because of the increased overall number being . diagnosed, the actual number needing to be admitted [to hospital] has . gone up,' she said. 'We know that there are many genes that predispose someone to get Crohn's disease. 'But . we also know that lifestyle factors like eating a lot of junk food or . taking many courses of antibiotics may make it more likely to happen.' The charity Crohn's and Colitis UK says most sufferers find fatigue the hardest symptom to handle or get treatment for. After four years of research they are launching a new questionnaire to help quantify tiredness. Professor . Christine Norton from King's College London led the project. She says . it will help doctors establish what treatment will work best. 'Young . people have told us that it really impacts their education, their . social lives and their ability to get and hold down a job,' she said. Miss Weatherby was admitted to hospital with blood poisoning after her Crohn's disease caused a perforation in the wall of her bowel, allowing the contents of her intestines to leak into her abdomen . Crohn's disease is a condition that causes inflammation of the digestive system. Inflammation is the body's reaction to injury or irritation and can cause redness, swelling and pain. Crohn's disease is one of the two main forms of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).The other common form of IBD is Ulcerative Colitis. Crohn's is described as chronic, meaning it is a life-long condition. Sufferers will have periods of good health, remission, as well as times when their symptoms flare up or relapse. There is currently no cure for the disease, but drugs and surgery can give patients long periods of relief from their symptoms. The cause of Crohn's disease is not well understood. Experts believe the condition is, in part, inherited, while an abnormal reaction of the immune system to certain bacteria in the intestines is thought to contribute. Viruses, bacteria, diet, smoking and stress have all been suggested as environmental triggers, but there is no definitive evidence that any one of these is a cause of Crohn's. Crohn's causes ulcers to form in the gut and inflammation that affects the body's ability to digest food, absorb nutrients and eliminate waste in a healthy way. Symptoms include: . Abdominal pain and diarrhoeaTiredness and fatigueFeeling generally unwellMouth ulcersLoss of appetite and weight lossAnaemia - a reduced level of red blood cells . It's estimated around 250,000 people suffer from the condition in the UK. It can start in any age, but usually appears for the first time between the ages of 10 and 40. The disease can cause complications including perforations. They happen when a severe blockage ruptures the bowel, making a hole. The contents of the bowel can leak through and form an abscess. It causes pain and a fever. Source: Crohn's and Colitis UK . 'Once I was out in New Zealand, things only got worse, to the point where I was panicked and constantly crying.' Miss . Weatherby attended the emergency department at Blenheim hospital on the . South Island, where medics at first suspected appendicitis. She said: 'Once they’d taken the . appendix out, they realised there was nothing wrong with it. While the . surgeon was in there he had noticed pus in my abdomen.' Having . been diagnosed with Crohn’s disease which had perforated her bowel, she . was transferred to Nelson hospital where she was prepped for an . operation to remove part of her intestine. She said: 'After the operation I was . put on a high dose of saline fluid, but recovering was a struggle . because I had developed septicemia. 'I was about to be transferred back . to the intensive care unit when the word came that the hospital was . being evacuated because of bad storms. Part of the roof of the ICU had . actually blown away. 'The . right side of my heart was failing, my right lung had collapsed and my . left was filling with fluid. My kidneys function had fallen to . practically nothing. It was a nightmare. 'James . and my mother, who had flown over from the UK to be with me, struggled . to get to the hospital in Wellington where I was transferred to. 'The doctors who were attending to me thought I might die on the flight over.' She . was finally transferred to a hospital in Wellington, where she was to . stay for three weeks, two of which were spent in intensive care. She . returned to the UK as soon as she was released from hospital. Today, . Miss Weatherby, of Manchester, is waiting to hear whether her Crohn’s . can be brought under control with medication and is hoping for her . ileostomy to be reversed next year. She said: 'I . have started to learn another language and I’m writing a blog about . what it’s like to be a young woman coping with a condition like this. 'There are thousands of us out there.'

"By . Mark Prigg . New York's attorney general says the car service Uber has agreed to limit prices during emergencies, natural disasters or other market disruptions consistent with the state's law against price gouging. The firm came under fire in December when huge snowstorms left people stranded - and Uber charged up to eight times its normal fare. Under the new agreement, it will set a cap during 'abnormal disruptions of the market,' limited to the range charged in the preceding 60 days and excluding the three highest prices. Scroll down for video . Uber came under fire in December when huge snowstorms left people stranded across the Northeast - and Uber charged up to eight times its normal fare. Customers can see the  driver’s name and photo before they arrive and receive an email of their route to ensure they have not gone around the houses. Uber takes a cut, usually 11 to 20 per cent, of the fares, which are taken from customers’ credit cards at the end of the journey — when they can also rate their trip. Journey costs increase during busy periods, but customers are not encouraged to tip because the gratuity is factored into the metered fare. Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said it will apply to UberX, Uber Black, Uber SUV and Uber LUX. 'This agreement represents the thoughtful application of long-established law to new technology,' said Attorney General Schneiderman. 'It provides consumers with critical protections to which they are entitled under the law – and it provides Uber with clarity from government about how the law will be applied to its innovative pricing model. 'This agreement also serves as a model for the kind of effective collaboration that should exist between government and technology companies like Uber.' The firm came under fire following snowstorms in December when ome rides cost 8.25 times the standard price. Salman Rushdie took to Twitter to complain about surge pricingm while digital media expert Tim O’Reilly accused the service of price gouging. Travis Kalanick, C.E.O. and co-founder of Uber, said, 'This policy intends to strike the careful balance between the goal of transportation availability with community expectations of affordability during disasters. 'Our collaborative solution with Attorney General Schneiderman is a model for technology companies and regulators in local, state and federal government.' On Monday, Uber said it is temporarily cutting New York City prices in a bid to compete with taxis.The San Francisco-based company is expected to apply the same cap policy for its services nationally. Snow surge: Under the new agreement, Uber will set a cap during 'abnormal disruptions of the market,' limited to the range charged in the preceding 60 days and excluding the three highest prices. It is already locked in a battle with New York's iconic yellow cabs . The move discounts prices by 20 percent, and follows similar price cuts in a slew of other cities including San Francisco, Chicago, and Atlanta. Uber, which recently raised $1.2 billion in new funding, stressed the new pricing would only be available for a limited time - but hinted they could stay. But 'the more you ride,' the company claimed in a blog post, 'the more likely we can keep them this low!' Uber has expanded around the world at an astonishing rate, taking on cab firms in major cities around the globe. Described as 'one of the most rapidly growing companies ever,' earlier this month it was valued at $18.2bn, one of the highest valuations ever for a Silicon Valley startup. The firm, which relies on an app and software to match riders and drivers, was started in 2010 - and now operates in 128 cities across 37 countries. The firm has raised $1.2 billion from mutual funds and other investors in a funding round valuing the fast-growing rides-on-demand service at $18.2 billion. Uber says its new pricing will undercut yellow taxis across New York, showing these examples . Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick announced the funding round on Uber's blog Friday. The funding, eclipsed only by the likes of Facebook Inc before it went public, is a vote of confidence by investors in four-year-old Uber's growth potential. 'Uber is one of the most rapidly growing companies ever, and we believe there are opportunities for continued tremendous growth,' Joan Miller, a spokeswoman for Summit Partners, an investor in the funding round, said by telephone. Investors hope the company, which allows users to summon a ride on their smartphones, can expand globally and diversify into logistics. The investors in the round valued Uber 'pre-money' at $17 billion, the blog post said. The $1.2 billion infusion took the startup's valuation to $18.2 billion. Fidelity Investments put in about $425 million, Wellington Management added $209 million and BlackRock Inc contributed $175 million, according to a person familiar with the matter. Venture firms Summit Partners, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Google Ventures and Menlo Ventures also participated in the round, a person familiar with the matter said. Kleiner's investment came from its Digital Growth Fund, run by former stock analyst Mary Meeker, known for her bullish recommendations during the first dot-com boom. While Uber has grown rapidly since its 2010 launch in San Francisco, it has run into serious regulatory issues. Ordinances keep it out of cities such as Las Vegas, Miami and Vancouver, British Canada. In some places, including Chicago, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., Uber and similar companies face lawsuits from taxi companies hoping to keep the new competition out. In Colorado, Governor John Hickenlooper signed a bill on Thursday that legalized drive-for-hire services in consumers' own vehicles, including UberX. In California, ridesharing is currently regulated through the state's Public Utilities Commission, although taxi drivers and Uber itself are challenging that authority. Her fund has had recent hits, including traffic app Waze, acquired last year for $1.1 billion by Google. Uber, which did not give details about its latest investors, operates in 128 cities across 37 countries. Kalanick said he expected to close a second round of funding from strategic investors of about $200 million. Uber originally started with a luxury town-car service, but in many cities has since added UberX, a low-frills service with nonprofessional drivers using personal cars. Competitors to Uber include Flywheel and Hailo, which connect passengers and taxis; and Lyft and Sidecar, which link passengers and drivers who use their personal vehicles. Uber sometimes offers promotional deliveries, such as roses around Valentine's Day or Christmas trees. Earlier this year, it launched a regular courier delivery service for small packages in Manhattan.","Will set a cap during 'abnormal disruptions of the market,' limited to the range charged in the preceding 60 days and excluding the three highest prices .

"By . Associated Press . Two Wisconsin sisters have filed a federal claim, saying they believe a cervical cancer vaccine caused their ovaries to stop producing eggs. Madelyne Meylor, 20, and Olivia Meylor, 19, both of Mount Horeb, claim their condition came from the Gardasil vaccine for the human papillomavirus, or HPV, according to the Wisconsin State Journal. Their attorney, Mark Krueger, told the newspaper it is the first allegation of its kind to reach a hearing through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, a special court established to evaluate claims of harm from vaccines. Bad medicine: Sisters Madelyn (left) and Olivia Meylor (right) are suing the makers of the HPV vaccination, claiming it casued them to become infertile . Protection? HPV vaccine Guardasil was approved in 2006 and now there is another brand, Cervarix, approved in 2009. They protect against cervical cancer, throat cancer, genital warts and other conditions . In a statement, the vaccine's maker, Merck and Co., says evidence doesn't support a relationship between the condition and vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control and the Food and Drug Administration say the vaccine is safe and can help prevent many of the 18,000 cancers in women and 8,000 cancers in men caused by HPV each year. Health officials recommend three doses of the vaccine against HPV, a sexually transmitted virus, for girls and boys ages 11 and 12 to protect against cervical cancer, throat cancer, genital warts and other conditions. Two brands are available: Gardasil, approved in 2006, and Cervarix, approved in 2009. The Meylor sisters say they are unlikely to conceive children without infertility treatments. Above, Olivia and Madelyn pictured with their parents at their Mount Horeb home . The vaccine injury program has awarded payments for HPV vaccine injuries in 68 cases for a total of at least $5.9million, according to the federal government and Judicial Watch, a nonpartisan foundation. The program has dismissed 63 claims, 81 are pending. The Meylors told the newspaper that they believe Gardasil shots caused their ovaries to stop producing eggs. They also have premature menopause, marked by insomnia, night sweats and headaches, and almost certainly won't be able to get pregnant, they said. 'I've always wanted a huge family, but I don't know if that will be possible,' Madelyne Meylor said. Out of options: Madelyne (pictured in blue) has always wanted to have a big family but doesn't know 'if that will be possible' after Guardasil. Above, The three Meylor children with their parents . Tests for three possible genetic causes of the condition were negative for both women, the newspaper reported. They are taking birth control pills or using patches as hormone replacement therapy.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Among the rectangular handsets of Apple, Samsung and HTC, BlackBerry has traditionally struggled to stand out from the crowd. So, in what could the last roll of the dice for the Canadian firm, it has unveiled more details about its first handset to have a square display. The BlackBerry Passport has a full HD 4.5-inch square screen, which is said to offer a similar viewing space to a 5-inch phone, but ‘an even better viewing experience’ because of the screen’s width. The BlackBerry Passport (pictured centre) has a full HD 4.5-inch square screen and shows 60 characters of text, compared to 40 on a rectangular 5-inch device (Samsung's Galaxy S5 5.1-inch device is pictured right). Apple's iPhone 4S is pictured left to show scale . The device was first revealed in June by BlackBerry boss John Chen during the company's quarterly earnings report. Last month, BlackBerry announced it was  offering . 240,000 Android apps to its smartphone users in a surprise deal with . Amazon. The . deal lets BlackBerry add a selection of consumer apps to its . devices, and to focus on developing enterprise and productivity . applications. For example, BlackBerry customers will be able to access popular . Android apps such as Groupon, Netflix, Pinterest, Candy Crush Saga and . Minecraft. The . apps will be available on BlackBerry 10 devices from autumn, when . the company rolls out the BlackBerry 10.3 operating system, the . statement said. The project was previously known as Windermere, and Chen said at the time that Passport will be officially announced at an event in London in . September. Further details were unveiled by Matt Young on the Inside BlackBerry blog yesterday: ‘Consider how IMAX movies begin with the screens set to a more traditional 16:9 aspect ratio projection for conventional movie trailers, before expanding to their true dimensions. 'The Passport is like the IMAX of productivity, and you don’t have to sacrifice screen real estate, vertically or horizontally.' Academic research has shown that the optimal number of characters on a line in a book is 66 characters. Most rectangular smartphones show approximately 40 characters per line, while the BlackBerry Passport is said to show 60 characters. This makes the Passport ‘the ideal device for reading e-books, viewing documents and browsing the web.’ It also solves the problem of having to switch between landscape and portrait mode when taking a photo or filming a video. ‘We’ve been living in a rectangular world for quite some time and know it’s a great ergonomic design that drives content, media consumption and quick communications,’ continued Young. The Passport is expected to go on sale in September, and combines a large touchscreen with a physical keyboard. BlackBerry CEO John Chen first revealed the square phone (pictured) during the Canadian company's annual general meeting last month . The Passport (right) is set to go on sale in September alongside Blackberry's touchscreen phone the Z3 (left), and the Classic (centre). It is unclear how comfortable the phone would be to hold, when making a call for example, and BlackBerry has not released any details about price . ‘However, the rectangle has become a defacto approach to smartphone design, perhaps limiting innovations. ‘Just as a passport is the universal symbol of mobility and was the inspiration for the size and form factor of this device, your BlackBerry Passport becomes your ticket to open new doors of opportunity.’ It is unclear how comfortable the phone would be to hold, when making a call for example, and BlackBerry has not released any details about the price. The blog post does, however, position the device more towards businesses than consumers. For example, it states architects and mortgage brokers could use it to look at full designs and schematics on the go. While medical staff could view X-rays and medical documents in the office with a patient . Young . concluded: ‘The BlackBerry Passport will take you to new places on the . best business trip you’ve ever had. We want you to imagine the . possibilities.’ Last month, BlackBerry announced it was  offering 240,000 Android apps to its smartphone users in a surprise deal with Amazon.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Having increased security on phones is a comfort if it’s lost or stolen - but having to add fingerprints, passwords and PINs does make accessing these devices a drawn-out process. Thankfully, Apple appears to be working on a way to make this process a lot easier, without compromising on high security levels. The firm’s latest patent reveals plans to add customisable security options, based on the user’s location, meaning the phone would automatically unlock when in a ‘safe’ location. The California firm's latest patent reveals plans to add customisable security options that could, based on a user's location, automatically unlock a phone when the user is in a 'safe' zone. For example, if the device is connected to the user's home Wi-Fi network (pictured) Apple is planning to put some muscle behind its future iPhones - literally. The . Cupertino-based company published a patent last month to use . an ‘artificial muscle system’ for focusing cameras in devices such as . its iPhone and iPad. The patent claims the system would contract in a similar way to how muscles move, to focus the lens and take images. The system could allow for much slimmer . mobile systems that use less power while carrying larger camera . components, the company said. For example, if the device is connected to the user’s home Wi-Fi network, or the network inside their office, the phone will not ask for the security code or fingerprint scan, and will keep the screen unlocked. Additionally, the patent describes how the 'location' doesn't need to refer to a fixed location, and could also include a user's car. To verify the location, the phone could connect to the car's Bluetooth, navigation systems or audio displays. Alternatively, if the phone is on a mobile or public network, in a pub or café, security levels could be increased. This could add extra security levels, in addition to the PIN, passcode or fingerprint scan. The patent, titled ‘Location-sensitive security levels and setting profiles based on detected location’ was filed in December 2012 and awarded earlier this month. Additionally, the patent describes how the location does not need to refer to a fixed place, and could also include a user's car. To verify the location, the phone could connect to the car's Bluetooth, navigation systems or audio displays (pictured) Alternatively, if the phone is on a public network, security levels will be increased, in addition to the PIN, passcode or fingerprint scan (scanner pictured). The patent, titled 'Location-sensitive security levels and setting profiles based on detected location' was filed in December 2012 and awarded earlier this month . ‘To provide a reliably pleasant and secure experience for a user operating a mobile device, it can be desirable to modify security settings or other device behaviour based on a detected location,’ explained the patent. ‘Mobile devices often have security requirements, such as passwords or passcodes. ‘Security requirements help ensure that a mobile device is in the hands of the appropriate party, [but] often the security level remains the same regardless of the location of the mobile device. ‘Because some locations may be inherently more secure, such as a user's home or office, these locations may be considered ‘safe’ and require less stringent security. ‘Conversely, some locations may be considered higher risk or ‘unsecure.’ In these locations, it can be desirable to implement stronger security protections.' As with all patents, this technology may not end up on a device.","The firm’s latest patent reveals plans to add customisable security options .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A long-lost cat that disappeared more than a decade ago surprised its owner when it turned up sitting outside her house last week. Molly vanished from her remote home in Gulberwick in the Shetland isles, which has a population of around 800, in 2003. Despite it being 11 years since she went missing - owner Lynne Peart, 39, instantly recognised the 16-year-old cat because of her distinctive markings. Mrs Peart said that wherever Molly has been she has certainly been alright for food . Molly's owner has no idea where she has spent the last 11 years but are glad to have her back . She said: 'I thought I was going mad. But I was so sure it was Molly. 'I called out her name and she turned around immediately, and then she started yowling. Mrs . Peart and 41-year-old husband John both thought they had seen Molly a . couple of weeks before she came home, but had convinced themselves it . wasn’t. 'We thought there was no way it could be Molly. But how wrong we were. 'I still can't quite believe it.' But . the mother of two, who works in social care, said the cat’s distinct . markings leave the couple in no doubt about its identity. She . said: 'It's definitely our Molly. There's absolutely no doubt it's her. I really couldn't begin to tell you where she's been all these years. Mrs Peart got Molly when she was a tiny kitten back in 1998 . Lynne Peart said she couldn't believe the cat came back after more than a decade . Molly sits by the window as if thinking whether to embark upon another adventure . 'I think she's been living feral as her fur was very thick and matted when she came back. But she's fat enough. She's looked after herself in her years away. The vet actually said she looks younger than her 16 years.' Mrs Peart, who first got Molly in 1998 when she was just a kitten, said: 'We got her as a baby with her brother Oscar. She was always the more feral cat. 'She would go out and stay away for a few days, but then come back. So when she went missing at first we thought she would just come back when she was ready. Molly is back living in Gulberwick, a remote village with a population of around 800 . 'But eventually we thought she must have died or be living wild and we just put her out of our minds. 'Oscar was missing her so we got another kitten, and we've had several different cats over the years.' Molly is now settled in with the family and is learning to get on with fellow cat Sally - but Mrs Peart said she can't be sure how long the wandering cat will stay. A vet said the wandering cat looked younger than her 16 years . She said: 'I like to think that she's come back to spend her twilight years with us. But she's very independent and everything's on her terms. 'I sometimes look at her and think I just can't believe she's actually home. I don't think we'll ever fully know what she's been up to the past ten years or so.

"By . Ashley Collman . Two junior hockey league players were arrested this week on child pornography charges stemming from an illicit meeting with a 15-year-old girl in a Minnesota hotel room. On Monday, Lincoln Stars players Thomas Ryan Carey and Brandon Nicholas Smith, both 19, were charged with use of a minor in a sexual performance as well as possession and dissemination of child pornography. A 15-year-old girl from Moorhead has accused the two men of videotaping her having sex, and then sending the video to several friends. Off the ice and into court: U.S. Hockey League players Thomas Ryan Carey (left) and Brandon Nicholas Smith (right), both 19, have been handed child pornography charges after allegedly filming a 15-year-old girl having sex in a motel room last February . The unidentified victim says she connected with Carey, who attended her school, on Facebook about a week before he played a hockey game in town. On Valentine's Day, the victim and a girlfriend met with Carey and his hockey friends at the local Days Inn motel after a game against the Fargo Force. The victim told police detectives that she had sex with Carey in one of the motel rooms, while Smith was present. Two days later, she started receiving text messages from other hockey players and girls saying 'nice video'. She suspected Smith took video of the tryst and confronted him, but Smith said it was Carey who took the video. Scene of the crime: The alleged incident with a 15-year-old girl took place on Valentine's Day at this motel in Moorhead, Minnesota . On camera: The unidentified victim says she slept with Carey (pictured), but didn't know she was being recorded. She says Smith was in the motel room at the same time . Carey subsequently sent the victim the footage which showed her nude and a male body part. Different story: Carey says the girl slept with Smith as well and agreed to be filmed . Detectives subsequently interviewed both men in Nebraska. Smith stuck by his story and said it was Carey who took the video of his liaison with the victim. But Carey said it was his friend who did the videotaping during his interview. Carey told investigators that both he and Smith had sex with the girl and that she was agreed to the film. Smith at first denied sending the video to anyone other than Carey, but later admitted he sent it to one Moorhead High School student. The victim's female friend, who accompanied her to the motel that night, also talked with investigators and says she too received the video. A hockey player in Pennsylvania said he received an image of Smith and the victim and told her the photo was 'going around' Both were handed the felony charges on Monday and will return to Clay County District Court on July 10. Carey's defense attorney Jade Rosenfeldt says they plan to fight the allegations. 'This is not the type of case for which the child pornography statues were intended, and as more information comes to light it will be apparent that this is a case involving consensual behavior and consent to photos and videos being involved,' she said in a statement. Both young men have been suspended from their team pending the legal investigation for violating the U.S. Hockey League code of conduct. Their status on the team will be decided once the legal process is over. Out of the game: Both men have been suspended from the Lincoln Stars pending the legal investigation.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . British holidaymakers have been warned that the seemingly innocent game of burrowing into sand dunes on beaches is an immensely dangerous activity which could kill them. The warning comes after stunned lifeguards found a 7ft-deep tunnel in treacherous sand dunes at Constantine Bay, near Padstow in Cornwall. No go: Lifeguards have issued a warning after this tunnel appeared at Constantine Bay . The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) has warned holidaymakers not to dig into dunes anywhere along the British coast this summer – as they can be death traps. Changing weather and damage done to dunes over the winter make them unstable. ‘Many sand dunes have altered dramatically over the last 12 months due to the winter storms,’ a spokesman for the RNLI says. ‘In hot weather the sand dries, creating an increased risk of collapse which could bury people alive.’ RNLI lifeguards discovered the latest tunnel, at Constantine Bay, earlier this month. Although it was empty, a backpack had been left inside it. The tunnel was roughly 7ft deep and just over 3ft high – meaning that children could easily have crawled inside. Lifeguards quickly filled the hole using shovels to prevent anybody from getting trapped. The RNLI has produced a new poster warning people to take extra care. Steve Instance, RNLI senior lifeguard manager, thinks the tunnel is a worrying sign. ‘This is the first sand tunnel we've seen this year, and fortunately the lifeguards spotted it and were able to cover it over quickly,’ he says. ‘Clearly it could have collapsed at any time whilst digging it, or even whilst walking over it, with potentially fatal consequences. ‘Although the large cliffs of sand may look enticing playgrounds, we urge people to resist the temptation to play on them or dig into them. Family favourite: Constantine Bay is one of Cornwall's most popular beaches . ‘The sand is very unstable and can collapse at any time, trapping anyone on or below it. ‘The areas of unstable dunes and cliffs are clearly signed on the beaches, and we ask people to take heed of this advice – as it's in their best interests for their safety.’ RNLI lifeguards began their peak season patrols last Saturday, meaning that all 57 life-guarded beaches in Cornwall will be patrolled, with lifeguard numbers increasing on some of the busier beaches. Peak season runs until 7 September, and is predicted to be the busiest time for RNLI lifesavers as it takes in the school summer holidays. The RNLI says that anybody visiting the coast should visit an RNLI life-guarded beach and swim only between the red and yellow flags, which marks out the safest bathing area.","Lifeguards in Cornwall are concerned about 'human mole' activities .

"By . Lizzie Parry . The parents of Olivia George feared she would die as meningitis ravaged her tiny body a week after she was born . A memory box compiled by the parents of a dying baby girl has become a poignant record of the newborn's miraculous fight to survive. Fearing Olivia would sucumb to the vicious meningitis ravaging her body, Danielle and Jamie George took more than 500 photographs to remember their little girl. But the couple were overwhelmed when the newborn fought the disease, making a miraculous recovery. They said the box, which had been designed as a compilation of Olivia's last days, has now become a record of their daughter's incredible battle to live. When Olivia was born at Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny on August 30 last year, she was a healthy baby, weighing 8lb 4oz. But within a week of bringing her home, the couple became concerned when she developed a cold, would not take her food and appeared to be very lethargic. Olivia was just days old when doctors told her parents she had contracted the life-threatening illness. Mrs George, 35, from Pontypool in South Wales, said: 'We wanted to capture every moment. We were terrified we would lose her as she was so ill, but we thought it would help us cope. 'It was absolutely terrifying seeing her . hooked up to so many machines but I knew if she survived then at least . we could show her the whole journey.' She and her husband, 41, took more than 500 photographs, fearing each picture could be their last. They saved cards from well-wishers and family, to add to the memory box. But the couple were amazed when their daughter miraculously pulled through. What was once intended to be a memory box to capture her last days, has now become a record of Olivia's fight for life. Recalling their ordeal, Mrs George, said: 'I just knew something was wrong. 'We started phoning NHS direct and they told us to go to hospital. 'Tests revealed Olivia had meningitis. We quickly decided to get her baptised in hospital too as we feared she wouldn’t make it. Danielle and Jamie George, pictured with their son Isacc and nine-month-old Olivia, began to compile a memory box, taking more than 500 pictures to remember her. But the tiny newborn fought to survive making a miraculous recovery . 'It was my worst nightmare, in just days I had gone from thinking my baby had a cold to being on her death bed.' Olivia’s parents had to pack just a few items of clothes in a bag and rush to hospital alongside their new baby as she lay in an incubator in the RAF helicopter. Mrs George, said: 'Luckily the helicopter that we went in was in the air already when the call went out as we needed to be taken to Great Ormand Street Hospital. 'We took a picture of the helicopter as it was such a poignant part of her journey. The memory box is now a record of Olivia's incredible fight for life, Mrs George said . 'She was put straight on ECMO - a . machine that works by creating a circuit, so the blood can circulate . bypassing the heart. This allows it to rest and recover. 'We had to sign a consent form as one of the risks is brain damage. 'It felt strange taking pictures of her being so ill but we prayed she would make it through to see what she went through. 'It gave us hope that she would make it and have a future, although we were terrified for her.' Olivia spent seven weeks in hospital, with doctors battling to save her life, but thankfully she fought the illness and was allowed home. Now, Olivia who is now back with her parents and two-year-old brother Isaac, could not look more different to the tiny infant who fought for life in an intensive care unit. Her father Mr George, said: 'Afterwards, when you reflect on things, you realise what you went through. 'Now Olivia is back home she has only needed to go back to hospital a few times. 'She still needs to take beta blockers and medication to widen her arteries, after she developed a heart condition called myocarditis as a result of the meningitis. 'But we are just so pleased she pulled through.' His wife added said: 'We are so happy we’ve put together the memory box for her as now she’ll be able to look back and understand what she went through. 'It is full of photographs, cards, messages from friends and family as well as things Isaac made for her too. 'She is so lucky to have survived and we can’t thank hospital staff anymore for saving our girl.' Meningitis Research Foundation estimates that there are around 3,400 cases of bacterial meningitis and septicaemia every year in the UK and Ireland. This means that every day nine people become ill with the disease. With one in ten people dying, a death will occur almost every day. A further two people will be left with life-altering after effects as severe as brain damage, deafness and multiple amputations. Meningitis vaccines offer excellent protection, but they are not yet available for all forms. So it's vital to know meningitis symptoms and what to do if you suspect someone has meningitis or septicemia. Symptoms of meningitis and septicaemia: . Other signs in babies: .

England fans also top the table when it comes to securing the best prices, paying 9.3 per cent less than their German foes. By comparison, Italian fans have shown a lack of faith in their team’s potential performance at the World Cup, with flights increasing a comparatively small 147 per cent year-on-year. England fans also come out on top in terms of securing the best deals on flights and hotels, paying on average £630.67 to jet out, whereas the German fans are forking out an average of £70 more. Comparing hotel costs in Brazil’s five main cities, KAYAK calculated fans will have to pay the most in Rio de Janerio, where prices average at £236 per night. World Cup bid: Fans are hoping England can have lots of success in Brazil . But England fans planning to watch the match against Costa Rica on June 24 will be pleased to learn Belo Horizonte has the cheapest hotels averaging £195 per night. Annie Wilson UK Managing Director of KAYAK said: ‘The World Cup competition starts hotting up well before the matches start. ‘KAKAK has seen a huge spike in flight searches, and the dream of reliving 1966 is clearly still alive as English fans have caused a far bigger increase than supporters in rival countries. ‘Our football fans will be cheering on the team in Brazil and even if we don’t come home with the trophy they can take pride in getting one up on our German adversaries when it comes to bagging the best flight prices.’","England fans beat Germans, Spanish, French and Italians in flight searches .

"By . Carol Driver . New course: Survival expert Bear Grylls' is launching the initiative in Wales . Learning how to use a knife for survival and tackling extreme river crossings are two of the skills children and parents can learn on a new Bear Grylls course. The Bear Grylls Survival Academy is launching its 24-hour family trip near Neath, South Wales, on which kids as young as 10 can take part if they are accompanied by an adult. The overnight break, which costs £429 for two or £858 for a family of four, is designed to inspired fathers and sons, and mothers and daughters to learn the TV star’s extreme techniques. Techniques . taught will include learning how to build and light a fire, how to . navigate at night, and best ways to use a knife for survival. They will also include foraging for . grubs and rodents, building a shelter, extreme weather survival and . river crossings. The . Academy has been designed for parents and 10-17-year-old children by . Bear Grylls - but it won't be taught by the former SAS reservist, but by . a team of highly trained experts. The course will run in Pontneddefechan, close to Pen y Fan - the highest mountain in South Wales. This . area of woodland, fast rivers, gorges and rock faces make it the ideal . spot, according to the academy, as the terrain is tough with water . obstacles and high, difficult ground being a key part of the challenge. Survival skills: The course includes guidance on how to cross a river in extreme weather . Family outing: The course is open to children as young as 10 . Bear . Grylls, who spent three years as a soldier in the British Special . Forces, said: ‘As a father of three young boys I love sharing my . survival techniques and going on family adventures together. ‘It . is not only exciting and fun but teaches them useful life and outdoor . skills and what it really means to be able to look after yourself when . the chips are down. ‘So . it is with great pride that we can now launch our 24-Hour Family Course . in South Wales as a great opportunity for parents to share these . experiences with their children together.’ Overnight trip: The 24-hour course includes spending a night outdoors under shelter . Survival skills: The group of 12 will learn various techniques while on the 24-hour course . The course is limited to 12 places and the price includes all meals, an overnight stay under shelter and kit. On completion, participants will receive a Bear Grylls Survival Academy badge and certificate.

"By . Carol Driver . Thousands of holidaymakers' plans have been wrecked following the collapse of a travel firm specialising in villa breaks. Air Parade, which traded as Luxury Villa Escapes and Villa Parade, ceased trading yesterday after weeks of speculation. Its main trading brand was Villa Parade which sold villa holidays around the Mediterranean, mainly packages to Spain and Portugal, as well as Florida. Ceased trading: The message on Villa Parade's website after its parent company went bust last month . Holidays ruined: Thousands of breaks - including to Florida - have been scuppered after Villa Parade went bust . Travel association Abta estimates the Huddersfield-based firm has more than 1,300 future bookings, which means thousands of UK holidaymakers will be forced to find alternatives for their breaks, despite paying Villa Parade months in advance. Customers with accommodation booked in Mallorca had raised concerns about the company over the past few months, with allegations made that Villa Parade was advertising and selling weeks into properties for which it no longer had contracts with. As reported by MailOnline Travel last month, customer Lorraine Beasant and her family were evicted by police and the owner of the five-bedroom villa they had paid £1,450 for to Villa Parade in 2013. Nightmare holiday: Lorraine and Mike Beasant were evicted from their villa during a family break to Mallorca . Luxury villa: The five-star property which the Beasants were evicted from in northern Mallorca . The owner claims he had no knowledge of the booking and had cancelled the contract with Villa Parade last year. However, at the time, the company denied this. Last week, Villa Parade won a High Court injunction forcing rival firm Travelopo to retract allegations it had made to the now-bust company’s customers, emailing them to say the owners of the properties had not been paid by Villa Parade, calling the bookings ‘not valid’. Travelopo claims it did so after being contacted by scores of Villa Parade customers who had seen their accommodation cancelled at the last minute, alleging Villa Parade was selling dates in villas that it did not have contracts for. Abta said up to 70 Villa Parade customers were currently abroad but said their holidays should go ahead as normal. All current accommodation bookings will be cancelled, although customers will get their money back via Abta's financial protection scheme. Luxury breaks: Villa Parade sold accommodation and flight packages to destinations including in Mallorca . Luxury villas: Villa Parade specliased in accommodation breaks in Spain, Florida and Portugal (pictured) It also has 400 forward bookings for flight packages which will also be cancelled, with refunds paid via the Civil Aviation Authority under the ATOL scheme. A spokesman for Abta said an investigation into Villa Parade had been launched last month following the allegations. He added: ‘Abta Code of Conduct investigations are always conducted very thoroughly and they were ongoing at the time of the company’s failure. ‘If Villa Parade had been found to be in breach of the Code it would have been liable to serious penalties. ‘Now that the company has ceased trading ABTA will support customers through the process of arranging refunds. ‘Customers can find out more about this on our dedicated web page www.abta.com/villaparade.’ No one at Air Parade was available for comment.","UK-based Villa Parade offered villa breaks in Spain, Portugal and Florida .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A gene linked to obesity is thought to trigger hunger pangs and affect a person's ability to resist impulse eating, a new study has found. Researchers at the National Institutes of Health in the U.S. said it could explain why people with the gene struggle to maintain a healthy weight as they age, suggesting some people are predisposed to becoming obese. Various studies have linked versions of the FTO gene to chronic obesity, but scientists have struggled to determine how the gene affects a person's likelihood to be obese, Ruth Loos, director of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York told CBS News. The new study has found middle-aged and older people with one or two copies of the FTO gene, appear to eat more high-calorie and fatty foods as they get age. Scientists at the National Institutes for Health in the U.S. have found a gene linked to obesity could trigger hunger pangs in carriers, and affect their ability to resist the impulse to eat high-calorie, fatty foods. File picture . Scans of the 700 participants in the study found lower brain function in the parts of the brain that govern a person's impulsivity and perceptions of food texture and taste. Senior author of the report, Dr Madhav Thambisetty, chief of clinical and translational neuroscience at the National Institute on Aging's Laboratory of Behavioural Neuroscience said: 'Sure enough, people who carry one or two copies of the FTO variant show increased intake of high-calorie or fatty food as they age. 'There may be a common biological factor underlying both the risk for obesity during aging as well as obesity-related behavior like your ability to resist impulse eating.' The findings, published in the journal of Molecular Psychiatry, found 45 per cent of participants had at least one copy of the FTO gene. Around 16 per cent of those taking part had two copies of the pro-obesity gene - giving a greater risk of a person becoming obese. A person's body mass index increased in those participants with one or two copies of the FTO gene variant. Researchers then compared the brain scans of those with the gene, and those without, to detect differences in brain function. The findings suggest those carriers of the FTO-gene have a predisposition to becoming obese . The results showed people with the FTO-variant had lower activity in the part of their brains scientists believe controls impulses and the response to taste and texture of food. A final step in the study saw the scientists review participants' personality and dietary habits. They found those with a genetic risk of becoming obese, those with the FTO gene, were more likely to be more impulsive and eat more fatty foods as they aged. The results mean for those with a greater genetic risk of obesity will face an uphill battle to maintain a healthy weight. But Ms Loos said the study does not prove a genetic predisposition to obesity means a person will be obese. She said: 'You may be genetically susceptible, but by living a healthy lifestyle you can overcome your genetics. You are not destined to be obese.'","Scientists in the U.S. have found carriers of the FTO gene are more likely to succumb to impulsive hunger pangs and prefer high-calorie foods .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . The BT Tower could soon be transformed into a giant vacuum cleaner. Chang-Yeob Lee from the Royal College of Art has designed a structure that could be attached to the top of the tower in London and used to 'suck up' the dust from air pollution. His Synth[e]tech[e]cology design would then convert caught carbon dioxide into natural gas by using water and sunlight - producing around 100 metric tonnes of methanol a year. Scroll down for video . A Royal College of Art graduate has created a structure that could transform the BT Tower into a sustainable biofuel source. This artist's impression shows what the carbon fibre and steel rigging design would look like. The project, called Synth[e]tech[e]cology, captures air pollution and converts it into fuel . Architect student Chang-Yeob Lee believes his Synth[e]tech[e]cology project could also become a tourist attraction, as this artist's impression demonstrates . Lee's Synth[e]tech[e]cology design turns the carbon dioxide found in the air into natural gas, called methanol. The technology takes the carbon dioxide and mixes it in a water-filled chamber with an electrode and a catalyst. The reaction caused by mixing these chemicals converts CO2 into a new molecule, methanol. Methanol can be used as a fuel, an industrial solvent or a starting material for the manufacture of other chemicals. Lee chose the BT Tower because it is one of the city's tallest buildings - at 581 feet. He also added that through pollution data mapping the area around Marylebone Road area - near where the tower is based - was found to be Britain's worst hotspot for air pollution due to heavy traffic. However, the architect believes the design could also be used on other tall buildings. The structure would be made from carbon fibre, filled with nanotubes and suction points to collect the carbon dioxide and pollution, and fitted to the tower using steel rigging. Lee claims that the structure could also be a good way of harvesting energy from abandoned structures and building around the city. In a video explaining his concept, Lee said: 'Pollution could be another economy. 'With recent technological advancements, pollutants could be positively employed as abundant, alternative, resources rather than simple negative filthy and sometimes fearsome matter. The Synth[e]tech[e]cology structure is filled with nanotubes. These tubes are used to capture the carbon dioxide in the air, mix it with a catalyst, and convert it into natural gas, or methanol . This images shows the inner workings of the Synth[e]tech[e]cology . by architect student Chang-Yeob Lee. The carbon dioxide and hydrogen is captured in the tubes and structures at the base of the unit. It is then mixed with a catalyst and water and releases methanol from the valves hanging from the design . This artist's impression shows how the structures design look like from the top of the BT Tower. Lee believes the design could be used on other tall buildings . 'The . new parasitic infrastructure has aim to raise the most polluted level . of air to above 60m with liquid asset production process, showing . alternate ways for 'economic profit' meaningfully engaged into pollution . can be a provocative strategy for 'sustainable ecology.' He also described the technology as a giant 'vacuum cleaner' - sucking dust particles and soot from the air. The project is described as a hybrid between 'a vertical oil field, which can directly provide recycled petrol generated from heavy traffic area, and laboratory for future resources scrubbed from atmosphere.' In the video Lee predicts that the BT Tower will eventually become redundant. He suggests turning it into an eco-skyscraper that would collect airborne soot and dirt particles, which would in turn to reduce . respiratory illnesses across the capital. His project plans to use some of the recent advancements in particle-capturing technologies developed by teams such as Princeton University. The team was one of the first to successfully convert carbon dioxide to methanol using the catalyst method. It aims to 'show how hybrisided new infrastructure can . gather pollutants, store, digest, and harvest them to dilute minerals . and biofules, celebrating clean air process on the ground level.' The architecture student created the concept as his diploma project. He was named one of two winners of the Sheppard Robson Student Prize for .

"By . Tara Brady . Councils across the UK have spent more than £7.2m on charging points for electric cars over the last three years but many are not being used. One in six councils admitted to having at least one point which has not been used at all over the past year. While less than a third of authorities have a charging point used on average more than once a week, more than half of which are used only by council vehicles. Councils across the UK have spent more than £7.2m on charging points for electric cars in three years . BBC Radio 4’s You and Yours found that council spending amounts to £1,750 per electric car. Answers to Freedom of Information requests from 91 per cent of councils in the UK revealed that 139 had spent £7.21m on charging points between them since April 2010. Twenty-five of the councils (18 per cent) said they had at least one point not used at all between April 2012 and April 2013, while 41 (29 per cent) councils had a point used more than 52 times over the same 12 months. Twenty-five of the councils said they had at least one point not used at all between April 2012 and April 2013 . Prof David Bailey, a transport expert at Coventry University Business School, told You and Yours: 'At the moment there are hardly any electric cars on the road. 'There are more charging points than there are electric cars. 'Much more effort needs to go into stimulating the demand side and educating people so that they know how to use these cars.' Figures from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency show there are 4,100 electric cars in the UK. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: 'Taxpayers are clearly being fleeced to fund what is little more than an attempt by the councils involved to brandish their green credentials. 'When only around four thousand of the 34.6 million vehicles on the road are electric cars, this amounts to a very expensive vanity project. 'In any case, since the cars are only suited to travelling short distances, their owners should expect to charge them at home or at their workplace: it’s not fair for them to land already hard-pressed taxpayers with a whopping bill to subsidise their expensive choice of vehicle.' In February the Government announced an extra £37 million to offset the cost of installing infrastructure for recharging electric vehicles, which will be made available to hospitals, local authorities and train operators to provide charging points. But the Local Government Association said investment has to be made in charging points. A spokesman said: 'You have to invest in the charging infrastructure before people start using it. 'Electric cars are a huge future international market. One barrier to that market taking off is the limited range before a car needs recharging, so investment in charging points is a vital precondition to this low carbon, sustainable and potentially hugely profitable market of the future.' 'No one is pretending that everything can change overnight' Department for Transport spokesman . The Government and motoring groups also warned that the electric car revolution would take time. A Department for Transport (DfT) spokesman said: 'No one is pretending that everything can change overnight. 'The Government is putting serious investment into the UK low emissions vehicles sector, including for electric cars. 'We are seeing encouraging growth in the number of people using electric cars - for example there were 966 claims for the plug-in car grant in April-June 2013, almost double the number seen in the same quarter of the previous year - but no one is pretending that everything can change overnight. 'That is why we are continuing to invest in the infrastructure that will support take up of this new technology across the country, including the charging points announcements we made yesterday.' The spokesman continued: 'Our goal is to ensure that the automotive industry in the UK can build on its recent success with clear support for investment in research and development and continue to make a major contribution to tackling the challenges of 21st century motoring.' Edmund King, president of AA, said he did not think the charging points were waste of time. He said: 'These things take time. At the moment, most people with electric cars charge them at home or at work. There is certainly a role for electric cars to play and I think their price will come down. 'We do need a mix of cars in the UK. Most two-car households could get by with an electric cart. We need to change attitudes.'","One in six councils have a point which has not been used in a year .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A pensioner died after he was forced to wait two hours for an ambulance, after suffering a stroke, despite living 100 yards from a hospital. Trevor Bryer collapsed at his home in Llanelli, South Wales on May 6. But despite three desperate attempts to call for help, his widow Karen Bryer was forced to watch her husband of 24 years deteriorate in front of her eyes. Trevor Bryer died after suffering a stroke in May. He collapsed at home in Llanelli and was forced to wait two hours for an ambulance to take him to hospital, despite living just metres from the nearest A&E department . An ambulance finally arrived, having travelled more than an hour from Haverfordwest, 46 miles away, taking Mr Bryer to the Prince Philip Hospital, which is visible from the Bryer's home. Two days later the 72-year-old former policeman lost his fight for life. Offering their condolences to Mrs Bryer, the Welsh Ambulance Service Trust confirmed they have launched an inquiry into what happened. Recalling the 'worst night of her life', Mrs Bryer said if she had been strong enough she would have carried her husband to the hospital, adding she thought about driving but hasn't been behind the wheel for years. She said:  'I thought the best thing to do was to let the ambulance crew see him first. 'But we waited and waited. How is it that an ambulance took almost two hours to arrive?' The 57-year-old said she is speaking out to ensure other families do not face the same heartbreaking ordeal. Mr Bryer lived just 100 yards from Prince Philip Hospital when he died. The map shows the location of his home (circled in red) and of the hospital . Karen Bryer, 57, said she called 999 three times, the first time at around 8.30pm on May 6. She said an ambulance did not arrive until 10.20pm, after travelling for around an hour from Haverfordwest, 46 miles from Llanelli. The Welsh Ambulance Service has launched an investigation into what happened . NHS guidelines state that the most important care for people with any form of stroke is 'prompt admission to a specialist stroke unit'. Stroke is the third biggest cause of death in the UK, with more than 110,000 people suffering a stroke each year. The Act F.A.S.T. campaign, which launched in February 2009, urges people who suspect a loved one or friend has suffered a stroke, to dial 999 immediately. The sooner a stroke patient receives treatment, the better their chances are of surviving and reducing long-term disability. NICE guidelines dictate that a suspected stroke victim must be transferred to a specialist acute stroke unit within one hour. The guidance also states a patient should receive a brain scan within one hour. Ambulance services across the country treat suspected strokes as life-treatening calls. Source: NICE and NHS Choices . 'All I want is that some other poor person doesn't have to go through what he went through, or that someone is left there waiting, waiting, waiting, watching the person they love the most in the world going downhill like that.' Mrs Bryer dialled 999 after her husband collapsed at home at around 8.30pm. She claims she made two more emergency calls, approximately 25 minutes apart, as she waited for help. The ambulance eventually arrived at around 10.20pm. She said she will never know if a faster response time would have saved her husband. The Welsh Ambulance Service Trust has sent its condolences to the family and has confirmed an inquiry is under way. Director of service delivery, Mike Collins, said: 'We extend our deepest condolences to the patient’s family at this difficult time. 'We have received a formal concern in relation to this and investigations are under way. 'We are liaising with the patient’s family directly and it would be inappropriate to comment further.' Mr Bryer died two days after being taken to Prince Philip Hospital in Llanelli, pictured . Ambulance services across the UK categorise each call according to how serious the patient's condition is. The aim is to ensure the most serious, life-threatening calls are dealt with first. The categories are nationally agreed, by the Department of Health and each ambulance service across the UK are measured according to required targets. - Red 1The most serious category, Red 1 is reserved for those patients who have suffered traumatic life-threatening injuries or those who are displaying the signs of suffering a heart attack or cardiac arrest.An ambulance is expected to reach a patient within eight minutes.Where possible two ambulance crews are dispatched to Red 1 calls - commonly a rapid response car, who can make initial assessments and start to treat the patient at the scene, followed by an ambulance, who can transport the patient to hospital. Ambulance providers are required to classify all 999 calls according to the severity of the case. File picture . - Red 2The second most serious category is for all other life-threatening emergencies. Examples include patients who have suffered a stroke, with serious symptoms or those who are struggling to breathe.Similarly to Red 1 ambulance crews are expected to reach the patient within eight minutes of the 999 call being logged. For both Red calls the response times are set out as national requirements rather than recommended times. The guidelines dictate that an emergency response - usually in the form of a rapid response car - will reach 75 per cent of these calls within eight minutes. Where onward transport to hospital is required, 95 per cent of life-threatening calls will receive an ambulance capable of transporting the patient within 19 minutes of the request being made. - Green 1These are serious but not life-threatening calls, for example diabetic problems or a suspected stroke with no serious symptoms.A Green 1 call requires an emergency response within 20 minutes. - Green 2Also deemed serious but not life-threatening, Green 2 calls can include suspected fractured arms or legs, or a patient who has fallen and maybe immobile.These calls require an emergency crew to be on the scene within 30 minutes. - Green 3These are non-emergency calls which require an on-scene response within 60 minutes or an assessment over the phone from the clinical support desk within 20 minutes. A patient who has suffered a suspected overdose, but is showing no serious symptoms, or someone who has suffered a non serious injury would be classified as a Green 3 call. - Green 4These are the least serious calls, which require emergency crews to be sent to the scene within 90 minutes or a telephone assessment within an hour.Minor scalding, a fall with no apparent injuries or someone in pain, but showing no serious symptoms would be classed as a Green 4 999 call. Response times for Green calls are recommended and are set locally rather than being national requirements.","Retired policeman Trevor Bryer, 72, collapsed at his Llanelli home on May 6 .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Harley-Davidson is known for its big touring bikes and iconic brand. But now the Wisconsin-based company is aiming to break new ground in a bold new move when it takes its first electric motorcycle, Project LiveWire, on a tour of the country beginning at an event in New York next week. And President Matt Levatich said he expects the company to become a leader in developing technology and standards for electric vehicles. Scroll down for videos . Harley-Davidson has unveiled its new electric motorcycle at the company's research facility in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. The company plans to unveil the LiveWire model Monday 23 June, at an invitation-only event in New York before travelling down Route 66 to let riders have a test drive . The announcement is seen as taking the company in an entirely new direction - they have not previously showed interest in electric bikes, instead preferring to develop the iconic vehicle that has been a mainstay of American culture for nearly a century. Harley will show handmade demonstration models of the new e-bike at the invitation-only event on Monday, having given a sneak preview today. The company will then take the bike down the U.S. Route 66 to 30 Harley-Davidson dealerships to give riders the chance to test drive the bike and provide feedback. Not content on just building an electric motorcycle, earlier this month Harley-Davidson unveiled two bikes aimed at women. The Street 500 and Street 750 were the firm’s first new bikes in 13 years and bosses hope they will become the must-have 'little black number' in every woman’s garage. Designers have got rid of the large, bulbous petrol tanks and shiny chrome which are synonymous with Harley’s masculine style. Instead the bikes have been given a sleek, black makeover and include smaller handle grips, lower seats and different foot peg positions to appeal to female riders. The move to create a motorcycle for the female market has been fuelled by a 30 per cent rise in sales to women over the past decade in the U.S. alone. One in 10 of Harley’s sales in America is now made to a woman. Harley will use the information it gathers to refine the bike, which might not hit the market for several more years. Some see the venture as a risk for Harley because there's currently almost no market for full-size electric motorcycles. The millions of two-wheeled electric vehicles sold each year are almost exclusively scooters and low-powered bikes that appeal to Chinese commuters. In addition the company has little experience in such an emerging technology. But one analyst said investment by a major manufacturer could help create demand, and Levatich emphasized in an interview with The Associated Press that Harley is interested in the long-term potential, regardless of immediate demand. 'We think that the trends in both EV [Electric Vehicle] technology and customer openness to EV products, both automotive and motorcycles, is only going to increase, and when you think about sustainability and environmental trends, we just see that being an increasing part of the lifestyle and the requirements of riders,' Levatich said. 'So, nobody can predict right now how big that industry will be or how significant it will be.' At the same time, Levatich and others involved in creating the bike predicted it would sell based on performance, not environmental awareness. Employee Ben Lund demonstrates Harley's new electric motorcycle at Harley's research facility in Wisconsin. The bike has a range of 130 miles (210 kilometres), after which it must be charged for 30 minutes to an hour to fully recharge the battery . e-asy riders: Bikers ride their Harleys as they attend the Hamburg Harley Days parade (file pic) With no need to shift gears, the bike can go from 0 to 60 miles (96 kilometres) per hour in about four seconds. The engine is silent, but the meshing of gears apparently emits a hum like a jet airplane taking off. 'Some people may get on it thinking, ""golf cart,""' lead engineer Jeff Richlen said. 'And they get off thinking, ""rocket ship.""' One hurdle the company has yet to address is the limited range offered by electric motorcycles. The batteries must be recharged after about 130 miles (210 kilometres), and that can take 30 minutes to an hour. San Jose State University police Captain Alan Cavallo helped his department buy two bikes from Zero Motorcycles, the current top-selling brand, and said officers have been 'super happy' with the quiet, environmentally friendly bikes made nearby in Scotts Valley, California. But he said American riders who like to hit the highway would likely lose patience with the technology. 'That's the deal with the cars; you can't jump in a Tesla and drive to LA, it won't make it,' Cavallo said. He added: 'People want the convenience of ""I pull into a gas station, I pour some gas in my tank and I go.""' Harley-Davidson Motor Company is the largest manufacturer of heavyweight motorcycles in the world. William S. Harley and William A. Davidson founded Harley-Davidson in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1903. The first documented appearance of a Harley was in a Milwaukee motorcycle race at State Fair Park in 1904 (pictured right). A year later, Carl H. Land of Chicago, the first Harley dealer, sold three bikes out of the initial line and by 1907 production had increased to 150 motorcycles. During this time, the firm also sold motorcycles to police departments and ramped production to 450 motorcycles by 1908. During World War I, Harley provided 15,000 motorcycles to the U.S. marking the first time that the motorcycle had been adopted for combat service. By 1920, Harley was the largest motorcycle manufacturer in the world with more than 28,000 motorcycles sold in 67 countries that year. From 1929 to 1933, sales of Harleys fell from 21,000 to 3,700, but this was reversed when more than 90,000 motorcycles were produced for the U.S and Allied Nations during World War II. The brand’s reputation was damaged in 1952 when Harley was charged with restrictive practices after requesting the U.S Tariff Commission place a 40 per cent tax on imported motorcycles. From the 1950’s to the 1970’s Harleys were featured in Hollywood films as motorcycles ridden by biker gangs and featured in 1969 bike classic Easy Rider (pictured below) Harley later became synonymous with the Hells Angels biker gang, too. American Machinery and Foundry bought Harley-Davidson in 1969, but Harleys became more expensive but of poorer quality. Sales dropped so significantly that the company almost went bankrupt, but in 1981, American Machinery and Foundry sold Harley-Davidson to a group of thirteen investors for £47 million ($80 million). In 1983, Harley established the Harley Owners Group (HOG), a nickname that has been given to Harleys from the 1920s, when a team of farm boys used an actual pig as their mascot during motorcycle races. In 2000, Ford began making a Harley-Davidson edition of its popular F-150 pickup truck. In 2008, the Harley-Davidson Museum opened in the Menomonee River Valley. According to Interbrand, the value of the Harley-Davidson brand decreased by 43 per cent in 2009, linked to a significant drop in the company’s profits over the previous two quarters. Except for the modern VRSC and Street model families, current Harley-Davidson motorcycles have stayed true to the classic Harley designs. This is why the move to an electric model signifies a shift away from its heritage. Harley-Davidson's attempts to establish itself in the light motorcycle market haven’t been as successful and have largely been abandoned since the 1978 sale of its Italian Aermacchi subsidiary, the company re-entered the middleweight market in 2014 with its Street series of motorcycles. This photo shows the control screen on Harley-Davidson's new electric motorcycle. With no need to shift gears, the bike can go from 0 to 60 miles (96 kilometres) per hour in about 4 seconds. The engine is silent, but the meshing of gears emits a hum like a jet airplane taking off . The bike was first spotted earlier this week on the set of the new Avengers movie and has now been confirmed by Harley. Here a stunt double for Scarlett Johansson is seen riding the e-bike during filming for Avengers: Age of Ultron at the World Cup Sangam Digital Media City Expressway in Seoul, South Korea . California firm Zero Motorcycles introduced its first full-size motorcycle in 2010 and expects to sell about 2,400 bikes this year, said Scott Harden, the company's vice president of global marketing. That would give it about half of the global market for full-size, high-powered electric motorcycles. In comparison, Harley-Davidson alone sold more than 260,000 conventional motorcycles last year. But John Gartner, a research director for the consulting firm Navigant Research, said having large, well-funded companies get into the electric motorcycle market could give it a significant boost. The major automakers helped drive sales for hybrid and electric cars, he noted. 'Their marketing budgets are much larger and they have dealerships set up everywhere, and so it's much easier for companies like Ford, BMW and Honda to advertise about their electric vehicles,' he said. The bike boasts an all-electric engine (shown) that can accelerate from 0-60 mph (0-95 kph) in four seconds. A lightweight aluminium frame surrounds the battery to keep the weight of the bike down and enable it to reach high speeds and have a decent range before needing to be charged . Levatich said true growth will require common standards for rapid charging and other features, as well as places for people to plug in. Harley expects to play a key role in developing electric vehicle standards, and its dealership network could provide charging stations to serve all drivers, he said. 'We've been very silent up to this point about our investment in EV technology,' Levatich said. But, he added, 'now that we're public, and we're in this space, we expect to be involved and a part of leading the development of the standards, and the technology and the infrastructure necessary to further the acceptance and the utility of electric vehicles.'","The Wisconsin-based company has unveiled its first electric motorcycle .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . It is an intensely personal question: what does it take to make you cry? But for 100 actors, writers and other male cultural giants, it was no trouble to share the secrets that set them weeping. Figures including Stephen Fry, Colin Firth, Patrick Stewart and Daniel Radcliffe have all revealed that it’s poetry that brings them to tears – and their most emotional picks have been collected for a new anthology. Tear-jerkers: Daniel Radcliffe, left, and Stephen Fry, right, have both identified poems which bring a lump to their throats . Though my mother was already two years dead . Dad kept her slippers warming by the gas, . put hot water bottles her side of the bed . and still went to renew her transport pass. ...I believe life ends with death, and that is all. You haven't both gone shopping; just the same, . in my new black leather phone book there's your name . and the disconnected number I still call. ...When he whom I love travels with me, or sits a long while holding me by the hand, . When the subtle air, the impalpable, the sense that words and reason hold not, surround us and pervade us, . Then I am charged with untold and untellable wisdom - I am silent - I require nothing further, . I cannot answer the question of appearances, or that of identity beyond the grave; . But I walk or sit indifferent - I am satisfied, . He ahold of my hand has completely satisfied me. For Harry Potter star Mr Radcliffe, modern poet Tony Harrison can reliably bring a lump to his throat with a touching portrait of a widower clinging to the memory of his dead wife. His contribution to the collection is a pair of poems, Long Distance I and Long Distance II, published in 1978. The verses, written from the perspective of the grieving man’s son, tells how the older man keeps hoping that his wife will return at any moment, and keeps the house ready for when she does. Of its closing lines, when the son admits that feels the same way about his departed mother, he said: ‘If the last line doesn’t bring you up short, you have a heart the size of a snow pea.’ The famous lines, some ancient and some just a few years old, were collected by father and son Anthony Holden and Ben Holden, and have been published in the anthology Poems That Makes Grown Men Cry, which was launched yesterday. Emotional: Sir Patrick Stewart, left, and Downton Abbey star Hugh Bonneville, right, chose very different verses . Sir Patrick Stewart, famous for his . Star Trek roles and countless theatrical performances, plumped instead . for a poem describing the beauty of nature. In his entry for the book he . described how God’s World, a 1917 poem by Edna St Vincent Milay, . brought him to tears in the middle of the street with its depiction of . autumn. Speaking of the . inspiring moment, which struck him in South Salem, an America town near . New York, he said: ‘I walked two hundred yards down the lane and broke . down helplessly weeping with the never-before-seen beauty and grandeur . of it all’. Meanwhile Stephen Fry chose . verses by the great American poet Walt Whitman, who wrote about the time . of the American Civil War. He described how the ending in Of The . Terrible Doubt of Appearances by Mr Whitman ‘never fails to choke me.’ War poet: Downton Abbey actor Hugh Bonneville chose verses by Rupert Brooke, pictured, who is also a favourite of David Cameron . If I should die, think only this of me:That there's some corner of a foreign fieldThat is forever England. There shall beIn that rich earth a richer dust concealed;A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware,Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam,A body of England's, breathing English air,Washed by the rivers, blest by the suns of home.And think, this heart, all evil shed away,A pulse in the eternal mind, no lessGives somewhere back the thoughts by England given;Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day;And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness,In hearts at peace, under an English heaven. Other contributors include Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes, and Hugh Bonneville who plays Lord Grantham in the ITV series. Poignantly, three of the contributors to . the book – journalist Christopher Hitchens, poet Seamus Heaney and . literary critic Frank Kermode – died while the book was being put . together. Mr Bonneville chose a war poem, The Soldier by Rupert Brooke, which contains the famous opening: 'If I should die, think only this of me/ That there's some corner of a foreign field/ That is forever England'. Mr Brooke, a Cambridge academic and . noted literary figure, tragically died in 1915 from an infected mosquito . bite while en route to the ill-fated landing at Gallipoli in Turkey. The . Soldier, frequently featured in Remembrance Day commemorations, also . emerged recently as a favourite of David Cameron, after he recorded a . reading of the verses for an upcoming album commemorating the centenary . of the First World War.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Touts are asking up to £575 a ticket to this year’s Chelsea Flower Show amid huge demand to see Alan Titchmarsh’s first garden there since 1985. All 161,000 tickets to the world-famous event starting in West London on May 20 have already gone, the  second-fastest sell-out in its history. The ‘Titchmarsh effect’ has left  gardening fans facing online prices of up to 25 times the face value of the cheapest £23 tickets. Main attraction: This is the plan for Alan Titchmarsh's Chelsea Flower Show 2014 garden charting his journey from his native Yorkshire to the Isle of Wight, where he has a holiday home . Organisers from the Royal Horticultural Society say that the ‘Titchmarsh effect’ has given the show a big boost. Only last year’s centenary show, when Prince Harry was involved in a show garden, sold out slightly quicker. RHS spokeswoman Hayley Monckton said: ‘Alan Titchmarsh is this year’s Prince Harry for us. ‘Alan is one of Britain’s best loved gardeners and everyone is very excited about seeing his garden.’ After over 30 years fronting the BBC’s Chelsea coverage, Titchmarsh chose to step aside this summer when he was demoted to a limited presenting role. Winning man: Alan Titchmarsh will return to Chelsea Flower Show for the first time since 1985 . His Chelsea garden ‘From the Moors to the Sea’ charting his journey from his native Yorkshire to the Isle of Wight, where he has a holiday home, is his first since winning a gold medal in 1985. Titchmarsh’s ‘joyous celebration of our flowers’ will mark his 50 years as a professional gardener and the 50th anniversary of Britain in Bloom, the annual contest run by the RHS for the country’s most well-tended town. RHS director general Sue Biggs said: ‘Alan is one of the most powerful forces in horticulture, reaching out to and promoting gardening to millions of people. ‘He has also been one of the biggest supporters of the RHS and, as this garden demonstrates, continues to generously support and promote horticultural campaigns that transform lives and reinforce our great position as a nation of gardeners.’ The face value of the cheapest Chelsea show tickets is £23 for evening entry, rising to £68 for all-day passes. But amid unprecedented demand, they are being offered on secondary ticketing website seatwave.com for up to £575 each. That price includes a £90 ‘booking fee’. Similarly, tickets on rival site viagogo.com cost up to £550 each, including a £65 booking fee. The RHS is urging gardeners not to buy tickets from touts and warning anyone with tickets that turn out to be fakes will be denied entry. It is trying to deter people from turning to touts by offering special £400 charity tickets to support horticultural apprenticeships. Ms Monckton said: ‘Once again the cream of the gardening world, from leading designers to specialist nurseries, are creating content, which is so fantastically exciting and spectacular that RHS Chelsea is a sell-out show. ‘As one of Britain’s best loved gardeners, there’s no doubt that Alan Titchmarsh’s return to create a garden with Kate Gould, celebrating the 50th anniversary of Britain in Bloom and his own 50 years in horticulture, has been an additional draw. ‘Please can I urge people not be tempted to buy tickets from touts as you can’t be guaranteed that the tickets they are selling are authentic and you may be refused entry to the show. ‘Instead of lining the pockets of ticket touts, 100 per cent of the funds raised from our £400 tickets will help to make a real difference to the future of horticulture and give people an amazing opportunity to start their career in one of the best industries in the world. ‘With a skills shortage in horticulture, not only will people be supporting a vital initiative but they’ll get exclusive access to RHS Chelsea and be able to enjoy the show after it has closed its gates to the public.’ Titchmarsh’s 1,600 sq ft display will feature a drystone wall, moorland complete with heather, birch and pine trees and a stream in its Yorkshire section. And there will be a beach hut and plants like sea kale that are native to the British seaside in the garden’s coastal element. The QUeen, seen here in 2002 with Prince Charles, is set to visit Chelsea Flower Show for the 50th time this year . Titchmarsh has described actually creating a garden rather than presenting as the ‘ultimate challenge’. But he has been helped by award-winning professional garden designer Kate Gould and does not face any potential embarrassment by being judged. Since his is a special display commissioned by the RHS, of which Titchmarsh is vice president, his garden will not be formally judged. He said: ‘I’m rather relieved in a way that I’m not having to compete for gold if I’m absolutely honest. ‘But it’s the people who judge it really. ‘So I’m determined to build a garden that makes people say ‘oh my goodness, look at that’. That’s the important thing. ‘I’ve got to show I can do it now as well as present it.’ Designer Cleve West, 54, is favourite to make it a hattrick of ‘Best in Show’ awards with his Persian paradise-themed garden for investment house M & G after triumphing two years running. His 2013 winning design included stone sentinels holding up intricate iron gates that led onto an enormous 300-year-old mill head mounted on a wall. Other show highlights will include two military charities parading World War I-themed gardens to mark the centenary of the war’s outbreak. ABF The Soldiers’ Charity has a garden called ‘No Man’s Land’ created by award-winning designer Charlotte Rowe. Help for Heroes, meanwhile, has a ‘Hope on the Horizon’ garden in the shape of the Military Cross - the decoration for extreme bravery awarded since 1914 - by designer Matthew Keightley. At just 23, David Rich, is Chelsea’s youngest ever professional designer of a show garden. He and brother Harry Rich, 26, are creating ‘Vital Earth The Night Sky garden’ for Irish utility firm Bord na Mona. The Welsh brothers’ garden will boast features resembling stars, fallen meteors and black holes and a spiral staircase will lead to a rooftop for viewing of the night sky. Gucci is relying on designer Sarah Eberle to fashion a gem of a garden. It features a mini catwalk and hanging bouquets suspended by chains made to look like Gucci jewellery. Former RHS Young Garden Designer of the Year Hugo Bugg, 26, is designing for the Royal Bank of Canada. Other competing designers include Matthew Childs (for Brewin Dolphin), Luciano Giubbilei (Laurent Perrier), Adam Frost (Homebase) and Andrew Wilson (Cloudy Bay). Last year, Prince Harry made his first visit to Chelsea to see the garden that his Sentebale charity, which supports vulnerable African children in Lesotho, created for the show. The garden, boasting native Lesotho flowers and a pavilion based on a traditional Basotho roundhouse, was designed for him by Jinny Blom and won a silver medal. The Queen is expected to make her 50th visit to the show this year.","Tickets to sold out Chelsea Flower Show is being sold for £575 .

"By . Ray Massey . Campaigners threatened to take legal action against the Government yesterday after it published a 50,000-page dossier on HS2 – which the public have barely 60 days to read. Consultation on the £50billion rail project runs until January 24, so readers would have to plough through more than 800 pages a day – the equivalent of reading War and Peace around 35 times. The Bill had its first reading in Parliament yesterday. Details revealed include the amount of land required for the project – about 2,500 hectares of high quality agricultural land and 2,300 hectares of poorer quality land. Campaigners have been given just 60 days to read a 50,000 consultation report on HS2 . This could be reduced after . construction to 1,500 hectares and 1,300 hectares respectively. Overall . the project will require the demolition of 339 homes and 21 community . facilities. Together with its environmental statement, the Bill weighs around 1.5 tonnes, roughly the same as a small car. Councils . and countryside campaigners accused ministers of forcing the Bill . through by giving the public a 56-day formal consultation period to read . and comment on it. When . weekends and the Christmas holidays are taken into account it leaves . residents and critics only 35 working days to check for ‘the devil in . the detail’, they add. The 51M Alliance said Government had 'lamentably failed' to make the business case for the project and described it as an 'economically and environmentally disastrous white elephant' Campaigners . say it will be impossible to absorb the full impact on homes and . countryside from the ‘fatally flawed’ HS2 scheme in such a short time. Council leaders complained that ministers were treating the public ‘with contempt’. There are: . The . row developed as the legislation – a so-called ‘paving Bill’ giving the . Government powers to construct and operate the high-speed railway . between London and Birmingham – was given its first reading. Lawyers . for the Campaign to Protect Rural England said the tight timescale is . likely to breach international law. They are preparing to challenge it . in the United Nations. Transport . Secretary Patrick McLoughlin says work will begin within four months. The HS2 environmental statement for the first phase from London to . Birmingham runs to 49,814 pages while the Bill itself is 332 pages – . 50,146 pages in total. The 200-page introduction alone is an inch thick when printed out, making the 50,000 pages around 21ft. The . entire dossier runs to 585  volumes broken down into 26 geographical . areas. A spokesman for the Woodland Trust, which has hired a full-time . expert to read the report, said: ‘To finish it by the end of the . consultation period would be like reading War and Peace every other day. We feel the timetable given to read and respond is unfair.’ Controversial: An undated photo issued by HS2 of the potential HS2 train design . Ralph . Smyth, barrister and senior transport campaigner for the Campaign to . Protect Rural England, said the United Nations convention on such . matters requires ‘sufficient time ... for the public to prepare and . participate effectively during the environmental decision-making’. The . CPRE will be raising the UK’s ‘non-compliance’ with the UN, complaining . that the ‘reckless timetable’ will make it ‘impractical for the public . to suggest sensible changes to improve the proposals’. But the Department for Transport insisted it was not illegal, and said it was being ‘fully open and transparent’. While . the public could begin reading the document online yesterday, the . 56-day formal consultation period runs from November 29, 2013 to January . 24, 2014. A protestor wearing a mask depicting Prime Minister David Cameron demonstrates against the High Speed rail line outside Parliament . The extent to which homes, the environment, beauty spots and local communities will be blighted is buried within the vast 50,000 pages of the new HS2 Bill and its linked reports. It notes: ‘Overall, the project will require the demolition of 339 dwellings and 21 community facilities.’ It says ‘community wide adverse effects’ in which ‘a substantial number of local people are significantly affected’ by HS2 construction include: Regent’s Park Estate, Camden; Park Village East, Camden; Wells House Road, Ealing; South Heath; Thorpe Mandeville and Lower Thorpe; Chipping Warden; Burton Green; Gilson; Water Orton; and the small rural community which lies between Weeford and Whittington in Staffordshire. At least two sites of special scientific interest will be ‘affected’ and construction of the project will require  approximately 2,500 hectares of high-quality agricultural land and 2,300 hectares of poorer quality agricultural land. It notes: ‘Wherever reasonably practicable, the land required temporarily for construction will be re-instated, reducing the amount of agricultural land lost to approximately 1,500 hectares of high-quality and 1,300 hecatres of poorer quality.’ Although HS2 will not require the demolition of any Grade I or Grade II listed building, some will  be ‘affected,’ the report notes. ’The project will affect Edgcote battlefield and one scheduled monument (Grim’s Ditch).' Some 18 Grade II listed buildings will be directly affected. ‘Six will be demolished, four will be altered and eight will be removed and relocated’ it says. ‘There will be modification to a boundary wall to the Grade I listed Hartwell House. Two Grade II registered parks and gardens and 81 lengths of historic hedgerow will be directly affected.' Planting will be used at Hartwell House registered park and gardens near Aylesbury ‘to ensure that the rural character of its setting is preserved'. And although ministers insist that  no ‘internationally designated’ sites of special scientific interest  will be affected, two UK ‘nationally designated’ sites will be. The report says: ’In the Waddesdon and Quainton area there will be measures to reduce the impact on Bechstein’s bat (a European protected species). Measures will be put in place to allow bats to fly safely across the railway line between areas of woodland habitat.’ Similarly, it adds: ‘In the Ladbroke and Southam area an area of woodland in Windmill Hill Spinney will be lost. Approximately 11ha of woodland and scrub planting and 7.7 hectares of species-rich grassland will be created adjacent to this area to compensate for that loss. This compensatory habitat will be suitable for a range of species including butterflies and bumblebees.’ The extent to which homes, the environment, beauty spots and local communities will be blighted is buried within the vast 50,000 pages of the new HS2 Bill and its linked reports . The report notes: ‘HS2 Ltd has engaged with Natural England in order to identify and put in place appropriate measures to mitigate or compensate for the effect of the project on these nationally designated sites. ‘Where adverse impacts cannot be avoided, HS2 Ltd has included mitigation and compensation measures to reduce effects on species and habitats.' But the Woodland trust said: ‘Looking at our analysis of the 21 ancient woods under threat, we believe there are at least three Sites of Special Scientific Interest threatened. These would be Long Itchington Wood in Warwickshire,  Sheephouse Wood in Buckinghamshire and Ranston Covert/Battlesford Wood which are part of the Colne Valley in Bucks. ‘ . The HS2 environmental report  says that of a total ‘Phase One’ route distance between London and Birmingham of approximately 143 miles (230km), about 33 miles (53km) is in tunnel, and about  46 miles (74km) is in cutting. Some 40 miles (65km) of the route is on embankment and  12 miles (19km)  is on bridges and viaducts. The report notes that the route has been kept ‘low in the landscape where reasonably practicable’. ‘At Greatworth, Chipping Warden and Aston le Walls the route will be in cutting and tunnel to avoid landscape and visual effects on these rural villages. ‘Through the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB)  between Chalfont St. Giles and Wendover, a distance of over 20km (12 miles), measures have been incorporated into the design of the project to limit landscape and visual effects.' This includes 7.5 miles of tunnel and 3.5 miles of cuttings. ‘This will avoid or greatly limit the visibilityand noise of the railway in the rural landscape.’ Construction will generate about 128 million tonnes of excavated material and almost 5 million tonnes of waste to be disposed of to landfill. ‘HS2 Ltd has selected a route alignment with the aim of avoiding the highest quality agricultural land, insofaras this can be reconciled with the need to satisfy or balance a number of other important environmental and engineering considerations.’ Some 67 dwellings will be ‘significantly affected by noise from the operation of the railway’.","Ministers given until January 26 for campaigners to read consultation report .

Painful performance: The man's eyes tear up as the small snake makes its way out of his mouth . Slithery: A performer inserts a live snake through his nose and mouth during a performance at the Ditan Temple Fair  in Beijing . In China, some couples have apparently . been trying to schedule their pregnancies to avoid having children born . during the snake year, in contrast to the coveted ‘Year of the Dragon’. However Tsai is largely upbeat on the . new Chinese year. He believes much-needed liquidity will be injected . into struggling world economies, and that babies born over the next 12 . months will be both self-motivated and agile. For souvenir makers, snakes have been a tough sell. ‘Last year, our business was a lot . better, because everybody loves the dragon, whatever his or her animal . sign,’ said Lin Peixiang, who owns the Beixiang Souvenir Factory in the . city of Wenzhou. ‘This year, business is a lot worse, . because only those born in the year of the snake love the animal. 'The . snake sign is a symbol of fear. People get scared when they see or hear . the snake.’ Here, there, everywhere: A young boy on his fathers shoulders wears an inflatable snake-hat at the fair, on the second day of the Lunar New Year in Beijing today . Lucky charm: The crowd at Ditan Temple Park, Beijing was allowed to touch the performer's python, a sign of good fortune for the new year . Return of the reptile: A female snake charmer cuddles her python on stage in a park in Beijing as China celebrates the coming of the year of the snake .

He points out that . according to astrological tables, this year's variety is the relatively . mild ‘morning dew’ type of common water snake, less venomous than recent . predecessors. ‘It's more moderate, humble and . patient,’ Lo said of the 2013 snake. ‘Unlike dragons that make abrupt, . attention-getting moves, snakes take slow and steady steps.'

"By . Martin Beckford . Police forces have been criticised for paying officers hundreds of pounds in ‘macabre’ bonuses for dealing with dead bodies. Families of victims of accidents and crime are likely to be horrified that officers are profiting from their personal tragedies. Police and civilian staff are paid compensation of up to £500 if they are sent to the scene of a car crash or murder, or have to take fingerprints from a corpse, according to figures obtained by The Mail on Sunday. An estimated £100,000 is spent every year on the payments for ‘outstandingly unpleasant’ work, despite almost all other bonuses being scrapped in a recent review. Gruesome: Officers dealing with unpleasant crimes can receive £500 - totalling £100,000 a year . Critics say police should not be paid . extra for just doing their jobs, and point out that neither paramedics . nor firefighters get bonuses when they have to handle dead  bodies. Even train drivers who witness suicides are not automatically entitled to compensation. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, vowed to quiz Home Secretary Theresa May over the issue this week. He said: ‘I would have thought that dealing with these matters were part of the job and did not require additional payments.’ Criminal justice expert Harry Fletcher added: ‘It’s traumatic for anybody to deal with a fatality and the best way forward is to provide counselling rather than a pot of money. Most victims’ relatives would rather emergency services were given counselling than paid extra.’ Until recently a bonus bonanza meant police across England and Wales received up to £150 million a year in a variety of extra payments, including ‘professional competence’ awards and ‘special priority’ cash if they took on extra tasks. Almost all of these rewards were scrapped after a Home Office review by lawyer Tom Winsor in 2011, but he allowed the payments of £50 to £500 for ‘outstandingly demanding, unpleasant or important’ work to remain. But new details make it clear that ‘unpleasant’ tasks usually relate to the dealing with dead bodies. In a document obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, Suffolk Constabulary states they may include ‘handling of a badly decomposed body, dealing with an extremely difficult fatal road accident or investigating and extremely unpleasant offence or incident’. Thames Valley police provides payments of £50 for civilian staff who have to ‘search/fingerprint dead body’ and its guidance states: ‘Payment only for cases deemed to be particularly unpleasant, such as badly decomposed bodies’. Angry: Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said he will quiz Theresa May this week . It expects to pay out £1,000 in the current financial year for workers who have to handle corpses, as well as £45,000 to officers and teams who carried out demanding or important work as well as unpleasant tasks. This year, two constables were each given £200 when they attended the scene of a 'female on hard shoulder hit by vehicle' Dorset said it paid out about £2,000 for unpleasant work last year while Gwent spent £1,900, including three payments of £100 to officers who had to recover bodies. South Yorkshire paid out £2,700 in 2011-12 for unpleasant work. The most detailed breakdown came from Hertfordshire Constabulary, which paid out £2,050 last year for ‘exceptionally unpleasant’ work ‘over and above’ normal duties. One PC received £250 for ‘body retrieved from river which had been there for some time’, while a colleague got £200 when they ‘attended murder/suicide scene and assisted with the removal of the bodies’. Two officers shared £400 to deal with ‘male hit by train – body dismembered’ and a sergeant got £200 when they were ‘witness to man who shot himself in chest and then assisted medical staff in extreme circumstances’. Earlier this year two constables were each given £200 when they attended the scene of a ‘female on hard shoulder hit by vehicle, body thrown some distance’. In 2011 four officers received a total of £800 to handle an ‘extreme decomposed body’ while one PC got £250 when they had to attend ‘suicide from bridge – hit by vehicles’. If each of the 44 forces across England and Wales spent £2,000 on unpleasant work cases, it would mean a total annual cost of £88,000 but the figures are likely to be higher in larger areas and in for British Transport Police, whose officers deal with suicides on railways. Police forces budget for bonuses they plan to hand out to officers or civilians that have to deal with dead people . Rob Flello, the Labour MP who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Victims and Witnesses of Crime, said last night: ‘Forces should be ensuring officers get proper support and any counselling they need, as should all those encountering distressing situations That’s where the money should go.’ The Taxpayers’ Alliance said: ‘Bereaved family members and friends may find this particularly macabre at a time when they will be under incredible pressure.’ Senior police have previously criticised bonus schemes as divisive and contrary to the culture of policing, and called for their abolition. But last night both the Police Federation, representing rank-and-file officers, and the Association of Chief Police Officers, defended the extra payments. Thames Valley’s Deputy Chief Constable Francis Habgood, said: ‘Even within policing there are some tasks which even the most experienced officer can find emotionally draining and challenging. 'These bonuses are not designed to reward officers for merely doing their day-to-day jobs, but to recognise when the task can try even the toughest emotional and professional resolve.’ Steve White, vice-chairman of the Police Federation, added: ‘Police officers’ remuneration should reflect the sometimes extraordinary tasks they are asked to perform.’","Police get £500 bonus to attend a car crash, murder, or fingerprint a corpse .

"By . Sally Lee . The 'ghost' of one of Australia's most notorious criminals is still lurking within the walls of his old jail cell in Melbourne - or so a group of frightened lawyers have been led to believe. A recent group of visitors were recently tormented by what they believe to be the voice of Mark 'Chopper' Read, who died last year at the age of 53, during a ghost tour of the now desolate Pentridge Prison. It was in this prison that the notorious Read had both his ears chopped off by a fellow inmate back in the late 1970s. Scroll down for video .

Lantern Ghost tour guide Jeremy Kewley said he was leading the group of lawyers around the historic prison when they heard a loud man bellow out near Read's cell 16 in D-Division of the prison. This startled not only the lawyers but Mr Kewley himself as he initially thought it was a prank by one of the visitors. 'Suddenly came this incredibly loud and aggressive male voice basically screaming out ""GET OUT"",' Mr Kewley told the Today Show. 'We just sort of froze.' Shortly after, the same voice yelled out and repeated again 'GET OUT!'. 'It scared the holy crap out of me,' Mr Kewley said. 'I had to assure the group that this was not part of the tour.' He said police searched the entire building but could not ascertain where the voice came from. He is adamant that this has never happened before. Mr Kewley also alleges that other group tours sighted an apparition that resembles Read in this very cell . Prison Pentridge was an Australian prison built in 1850 and closed in May, 1997. Other notable prisoners include bush ranger Ned Kelly and Ronald Ryan who was the last man to be executed in Australia .

"By . Claire Ellicott . When he vented his frustration about holiday prices shooting up during the school half-term break, Paul Cookson struck a chord with other parents. His rant to 250 Facebook friends quickly went viral as outraged parents shared his post about rip-off prices 143,000 times. Now the issue may even be debated in Parliament after more than 100,000 signed an online petition calling for the Government to curb prices. Scroll down for video . Father-of-one Paul Cookson, 41, wrote an online tirade about price hikes during school holidays - it went viral . A survey by the Daily Mail yesterday showed that some holidays will more than double in cost during half-term next month. Mr . Cookson, 41, who was inspired to speak out after trying to book a trip . to Center Parcs with his seven-year-old daughter Phoebe, said he was . stunned by the response on social media. His . initial post asked why parents should be penalised for doing the right . thing and not taking their children away during term time. He . then set up a Facebook group, Holiday Price Increase, and one member . posted a link to an online petition titled ‘Stop holiday companies . charging extra in school holidays’ which at the time had only about . 3,000 signatures. 'Sick to death of being ripped off': Mr Cookson's Facebook post was shared 143,000 time by people who agreed . Price rise: Mr Cookson noticed that the cost of a stay at Center Parcs in Sherwood Forest, pictured, went up by £300 during half-term week . Mr Cookson, of Chillington, Devon, said: ‘It was exactly what I would’ve started, so I thought I may as well help it along.’ The . sales director started his post after trying to book a villa at Center . Parcs Sherwood Forest during half-term last October and finding that the . price was £300 higher than for the week before. He wrote: ‘Share this post if you have also had enough.’ ‘I think I’ve touched a nerve with this one,’ he said. ‘I don’t see why I should be penalised for sticking to the rules.’ Mother-of-two . Donna Thresher, from Essex, set up the petition last March in protest . at the £600 difference in the cost of taking her family away during . school holidays. She thought . the petition, which calls for a cap on price rises in the school . holidays, was ‘dead in the water’ – until Mr Cookson’s Facebook post . ignited interest in it. Campaigns . which reach 100,000 signatures on the Government’s e-petitions website . can be given parliamentary time, although no decision has been taken . yet. Mr Cookson acknowledged . that the call for price regulation might not be successful but said . that it was raising awareness and increasing the chance that travel . firms would change their policies. New rules mean head teachers can grant pupils absence outside school holidays only in exceptional circumstances. The sales director from the South Hams in Devon set up a Facebook group called Holiday Price Increase for those who felt the same way as he does - it now has more than 12,000 members . E-petition: Donna Thresher's online call for action against holiday price hikes has 140,000 signatures . The . Association of British Travel Agents said that one solution would be to . stagger school holiday dates, rather than having most pupils off at the . same time. The Department . for Education said academies and free schools already had the power to . set different term dates, with council-run schools being given it from . 2015. The National Union of . Teachers has warned this could result in travel firms extending the . periods in which they charge higher prices. The . Department for Business said the UK holiday industry relied on profits . from peak periods, while Center Parcs said its prices were based on . supply and demand.","Paul Cookson, 41, wrote online rant after trying to book a half-term holiday .

"By . Liz Hull . A woman who started a fire which killed five people – including three children aged under five – was jailed for 30 years yesterday. Melanie Smith, 43, set fire to a pushchair in an act of ‘exceptional wickedness’ because she was fed up with it being left outside her flat. The devastating inferno she started trapped a neighbouring  couple and three young children in a first-floor flat. Scroll down for video . Arson: This is the living room of a home in Prestatyn, north Wales which was set on fire by a neighbour . Devastation: The fire set by Melanie Smith was hot enough to melt a television, as this picture shows . Tragedy: A young couple, their baby son and their niece and nephew were killed in the fire last October, which left a bedroom wardrobe totally charred . Lee-Anna Shiers, 20, her 23-year-old . partner Liam Timbrell, their baby son, Charlie, 15 months, Miss Shiers’s . nephew Bailey, four, and her niece Skye, two, all burned to death. The 200C blaze was so intense it melted a television and cooker hood in the couple’s first floor flat. As the fire took hold, Mr Timbrell was . heard in the background of a 999 call screaming: ‘Oh my God, oh my God, . we’re going to die.’ Despite being badly burned, he managed . to tell police that, moments earlier, he had heard Smith, a . mother-of-five, shouting through their letterbox: ‘I’m going to burn . your house down.’ Mr Timbrell and Charlie died later in hospital. Miss Shiers, Bailey and Skye, who were . the children of Miss Shiers’s brother Steve Allen, 28, and were . sleeping over for the night, perished in a bedroom. Jobless Smith, who lived in the flat below, was convicted of five counts of murder last month. Yesterday a judge handed down five life sentences and told her she would serve a minimum of 30 years. Mr Justice Griffith-Williams said: . ‘The setting fire to the pushchair was an act of exceptional wickedness, . almost unparalleled in its consequences. Wreck: Smith was today sentenced to a minimum 30 years in prison; the stairs in the house are pictured . Entrance: The fire was set in a hallway in the building where the family and the killer all lived; the victims' door is shown here . Heat: A photograph showing the damage to the property's kitchen following Smith's drunken rampage . Guilty: Melanie Smith has been convicted of killing her neighbours by setting fire to their home . ‘For those who had to hear the . evidence of the 999 calls, the horror of those moments in the flat . upstairs as Lee-Anna and Liam faced the awful inevitability of their . imminent deaths will be forever etched on their memories.’ Mold Crown Court was told that Smith, . who was in a difficult relationship with Steven Clarkson, 45, who . cheated on her, was ‘bitterly resentful’ of Miss Shiers and Mr . Timbrell’s happy partnership. She had repeatedly rowed with Miss . Shiers over Charlie’s pushchair being left in a communal hallway of the . flats, in Prestatyn, North Wales, as well as the couple making noise . upstairs. Smith had also accused Miss Shiers of . having a sexual relationship with Mr Clarkson, an allegation, the court . heard, for which there was ‘no basis at all’. On one occasion Smith, a heavy . drinker, is alleged to have told Miss Shiers: ‘I will set your house on . fire with you and your kids in.’ Seven weeks later, on October 19 last . year, she carried out the threat. The court was read a victim impact . statement from Jonty Lewis, 29, the mother of Skye and Bailey, who said . her heart had been ‘torn apart’ by the deaths. ‘When I wake up in the morning, that . first minute is beautiful,’ she said. ‘In those 60 seconds I feel no . pain and I’m just listening for the laughter and footsteps running . across the landing in the hope that my bedroom door will fly open and . they will come bouncing in, jump onto the bed so that I can smother them . in kisses. It is then that reality sets in. My heart is wrenched and . the heavy empty feeling engulfs me. Poignant: This picture frame in the living room which appears to contain the word 'Baby' was melted . Disaster: The fire destroyed most of the building, with the furniture in the living room wrecked . Fury: The arson attack, leaving the stairs looking like a bomb site, stemmed from a disagreement over a pram . Ruin: The kitchen was almost unrecognisable despite its fire prevention measures . ‘I realise that I will never hold my . children’s hands again, teach them to ride a bike. The “normal” things a . parent should be allowed to do.’ Smith denied setting the fire and even . admitted when she took the stand that the killer was ‘beyond evil’. But . it later emerged that she had a history of cruelty to her own children, . three of whom she abandoned as toddlers. Her ex-husband, Paul Smith, 51, said . Smith stubbed cigarettes out on her baby son’s forehead, hacked off her . toddler daughter’s blonde hair, scalded her with boiling water and . locked her in an understairs cupboard as punishment. ‘She destroyed my family years ago, . and by setting fire to that house she’s ruined the lives of so many . other people,’ he said. ‘It’s horrific. That evil woman deserves to rot . in hell.’ One of Smith’s daughters, Charlotte, . now 23 and a mother of one, added: ‘It shocked me to know what she’d . done, but it’s not out of character. ‘She was a mother from hell to me – . and she still is. Spending the rest of her life in prison won’t come . close to what she deserves.’ Killer: Smith arriving at Mold Crown Court today for her sentencing hearing over the murders . Weeping: Stephanie Watson, mother of victim Liam Trimbell, breaks down at a press conference . Blaze victims: Liam Timbrell, right, with Lee-Anna Shiers and their baby Charlie shortly after his birth .

"By . Abigail Frymann . The weary faces of the men who endured the trenches of Europe and the determination of those treating them are captured in this forgotten trove of photos. The timeworn photo album belonging to nurse Catherine Bennett - lost for years in the locked cabinet of an earl’s study - reveals the courage of British troops injured during World War One. The album was discovered by chance inside a locked drawer of a study in Earl of Stamford's stately home, Dunham Massey in Greater Manchester. Stretchered: Men carry an injured soldier into Dunham Massey, which became known as Stamford Military Hospital and treated 282 soldiers between April 1917 and January 1919 . The Georgian stately home served as a military hospital between 1917 and 1919, nursing hundreds of traumatised ‘Tommies’ back to health. The candid images recorded by Sister Catherine and carefully preserved in the gilt-edged album she kept show the range of injures suffered by troops during tortuous exchanges in France and Belgium. Road to recovery: Sister Catherine captioned this photo 'W Timms in bed with broken leg'. The album reveals the range of injuries suffered by troops in the trenches . 'Safely tucked up in bed': the troops were brought to Dunham Massey from the battlefields of France and Belgium . The saloon at Dunham Massey, which was used as a ward: even the lady of the manor rolled up her sleeves to help run the hospital and get the soldiers back to health . Ladies of the manor - including Lady Penelope, widow of the 9th Earl of Stamford - cast away fine clothes and rank to help run the hospital. And as part of the centenary celebrations for the Great War, National Trust staff who run Dunham will transform the stately home back into Stamford Military Hospital. They will spend the next few months re-instating wartime features and artefacts for when the home re-opens next March. Convalescing community: Dunham Massey will be transformed into a military hospital again for next year's centenary of the start of 'war to end all wars' Nursing times: Sister Catherine Eva Bennett, whose album was lost for years in the locked cabinet of a Cheshire earl's study, and Lady Jane Grey - Lady Penelope's daughter - who was only 15 when war broke out . Household troops: almost 300 soldiers were treated at Dunham Massey. This photo of soldiers and staff is taken in the gardens of the 3,000-acre estate . Sister Catherine’s album was found during a clearout of the study belonging to the tenth Earl, Roger Grey, who died in the 1970s. The album has now been scanned by conservation staff at Manchester’s John Rylands Library and will play a key role in the new exhibition, ensuring visitors never forget the price paid by British soldiers and the efforts made to save them.","The album of photos lay hidden in a locked drawer for decades .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . Original documents from one of the biggest intelligence leaks in history - a who's who of Soviet spying - were released on Monday after being held in secret for two decades. The files smuggled out of Russia in 1992 by senior KGB official Vasili Mitrokhin describe sabotage plots, booby-trapped weapons caches and armies of agents undercover in the West - the real-life inspiration for the fictional Soviet moles in The Americans TV series. In reality, top-quality spies could be hard to get. The papers reveal that some were given Communist honors and pensions by a grateful USSR, but others proved loose-lipped, drunk or unreliable. Scroll down for video . The Mitrokhin Archive, left, has been described by the FBI as the most complete intelligence ever received from any source, while Keri Russell, right, plays a Soviet KGB officers posing as an American in the 1980s Cold War period drama The Americans . Intelligence historian Christopher Andrew said the vast dossier, released by the Churchill Archives Centre at Cambridge University, was considered 'the most important single intelligence source ever' by British and American authorities. Mitrokhin was a senior archivist at the KGB's foreign intelligence headquarters - and a secret dissident. For more than a decade he secretly took files home, copied them in longhand and then typed and collated them into volumes. He hid the papers at his country cottage, or dacha, some stuffed into a milk churn and buried. After the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, Mitrokhin traveled to a Baltic state - which one has never been confirmed - and took a sample of his files to the U.S. Embassy, only to be turned away. Robert Lipka, a National Security Agency employee who was paid $27,000 for handing secrets to Russia in the 1960s . So he tried the British embassy, where a junior diplomat sat him down and asked, 'Would you like a cup of tea?' 'That was the sentence that changed his life,' said Andrew. Smuggled out of Russia, Mitrokhin spent the rest of his life in Britain under a false name and police protection, dying in 2004 at 81. The world did not learn of Mitrokhin until Andrew published a book based on his files in 1999. It caused a sensation by exposing the identities of KGB agents including 87-year-old Melita Norwood, the 'great-granny spy,' who had passed British atomic secrets to the Soviets for years. Mitrokhin's files describe Norwood as a 'loyal, trustworthy, disciplined agent' who was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour for her service. She was more reliable than the famous Cambridge Spies, the high-ranking British intelligence officials who worked secretly for the Soviets. The files describe Guy Burgess as 'constantly under the influence of alcohol,' while Donald Maclean was 'not very good at keeping secrets.' Undated handout photo issued by the University of Cambridge of one of Vasili Mitrokhin's handwritten notes as members of the Cambridge Five spy ring were regarded by their Soviet handlers as hopeless drunks who were incapable of keeping secrets, newly released files suggest . Vasili Mitrokhin, pictured soon after defecting from the Soviet Union, some 20 years afo . The newly released papers include a list of KGB agents in America over several decades. It runs to 40 pages and about 1,000 names. One of the most notorious was code-named 'Dan.' He was Robert Lipka, a National Security Agency employee who was paid $27,000 for handing secrets to Russia in the 1960s. After Mitrokhin's information was passed by Britain to U.S. intelligence services, Lipka was arrested and sentenced to 18 years in prison. The volumes also reveal that Soviet agents stashed weapons and communications equipment in secret locations around NATO countries. Included is a map of Rome showing three caches, along with detailed instructions for finding them. It's unclear how many such weapons dumps have been tracked down by Western authorities. While some agents targeted the West, many more were deployed inside the Soviet bloc. The files list undercover agents sent to then-Czechoslovakia to infiltrate the dissidents behind the 1968 Prague Spring pro-democracy uprising. Others targeted the entourage of Polish cleric Karol Wojtyla, who would later become Pope John Paul II. The KGB noted with disapproval the future pontiff's 'extremely anticommunist views.' KGB agents including 87-year-old Melita Norwood, the 'great-granny spy,' who had passed British atomic secrets to the Soviets for years . The Churchill Archive is giving researchers access to 19 boxes containing thousands of Russian-language files, typed by Mitrokhin from his original handwritten notes. The notes themselves remain classified. There are glimpses of Mitrokhin's mindset in the titles he gave the volumes, including The Accursed Regime and The Mousetrap. Andrew said Mitrokhin took huge risks, knowing that 'a single bullet in the back of the head' would be his fate if he was caught. 'The material mattered to him so desperately that he was prepared to put his life on the line for it,' Andrew said.","Original documents from one of the .

"By . Associated Press . General Motors Co. is recalling more than 29,000 Chevrolet Cruze compact cars because metal parts in the air bag assemblies can hit the driver and passengers if the bags are inflated. It is the latest of a series of . recalls that have heaped humiliation on the 106-year-old car manufacturer . and brings the number of models called back this year to 45 - totaling more than 20 million faulty cars worldwide. The cars, from the 2013 and 2014 model years, were built with an incorrect baffle, and that can cause the air bag inflator to rupture if the bags are deployed, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said. If that happens, metal fragments could hit people in the car, and the air bags may not inflate to protect them. Baffling: The Chevrolet Cruzes were built with an incorrect baffle, and that can cause the air bag inflator to rupture if the bags are deployed . The air bags were built by Japanese parts supplier Takata Corp., but the problem is different from another air bag issue that's causing big recalls across the auto industry, the safety agency said Thursday. GM had ordered dealers to stop selling new Cruzes on Wednesday. Spokesman Jim Cain said the order for most cars was lifted later in the day when GM determined which cars were affected. Dangerous: An incorrect baffle can cause the air bag inflator to rupture if the bags are deployed, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration say . The Cruze, built in Lordstown, Ohio, is GM's top-selling car. GM found out about the problem on May . 1, when a driver filed a lawsuit naming the company, according to . documents filed with NHTSA. The lawsuit alleged that an air bag in a 2013 Cruze deployed improperly and injured the driver. General Motors has recalled more than 20 million cars worldwide this year alone for a variety of faults. They include the following: . February 7 2014 - GM recalls about 800,000 Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5 vehicles due to faulty ignition switches. February 24 - GM adds 600,000 Chevrolet HHR, Pontiac Solstice, Saturn Ion and Saturn Sky vehicles to the recall. March 28 - GM expands its ignition switch recall, adding 824,000 cars sold in the United States between 2008 and 2011 to the list. The switch recall alone covers 2.6 million cars sold worldwide. March 28 - GM confirmed that one more death had been caused by the ignition switch problem, raising the total to 13. April 10 - GM finds another flaw in the ignitions of the 2.6 million vehicles it has already recalled. May 15 - GM recalls 3 million more cars - most of which were built before the automaker’s 2009 bankruptcy - due to a wiring problem. May 16 - GM agrees to pay a $35 million fine to settle a federal investigation into why its ignition switch recall took ten years to deploy. May 20 - GM recalls another 2.4 million vehicles, including late model editions of the Buick Enclave, Chevrolet Traverse and GMC Acadia, for faulty seatbelts and transmissions. May 21 - GM recalls 218,000 Chevy Aveos amid claims of overheating and fires. May 23 - Japanese carmaker Suzuki recalls 184,000 vehicles sold in the U.S. that GM built for it in South Korea. June 13 - GM recalls 512,000 cars, most of which are Camaros that can be accidently shut off while driving if the key is carrying too much weight. June 16 - GM recalls about 3.4 million cars for the same reason. Company engineers inspected the air bag and contacted Takata. GM told NHTSA about the problem on May 27. GM sent Cruze air bags to Takata, and the company figured out what was wrong on June 20. GM decided to recall the cars on June 23, according to the document. It comes weeks after GM was fined $35 million by NHTSA for its slow response to the small-car ignition switch problem. Earlier this month, the firm urged drivers to remove key chains from their car keys after it admitted it needed to change or replace the keys for about 3.4 million cars because they could cause the ignition switch to move out of position if they are carrying too much weight. GM said that the switches can rotate out of 'run' if the key has excess weight and the car 'experiences some jarring event', such as hitting a pothole or crossing a railroad track. That can shut off the engines and disable power steering, causing drivers to lose control. Also, the air bags won't work. The recall affects seven cars with model years ranging from 2000 to 2014. That recall covered the 2005-2009 . Buick LaCrosse; 2006-2014 Chevrolet Impala; 2000 to 2005 Cadillac . Deville; 2004-2011 Cadillac DTS; the 2006-2011 Buick Lucerne; the 2004 . and 2005 Buick Regal LS and GS; and the Chevy Monte Carlo from the 2006 . through 2008 model years. GM is already recalling 2.6 million older small cars, mostly in the U.S., for a similar problem where the ignition switch slips out of 'run' and causes an engine stall. The $35 million fine came after lawmakers expressed disbelief at General Motors' explanation for why it took 11 years to recall millions of small cars with defective ignition switches, and also confronted its chief executive with evidence that the company dragged its feet on a similar safety issue in different vehicles. CEO . Mary Barra and attorney Anton Valukas, who recently released a 315-page . investigative report into the recall, endured skepticism and some . lecturing at a House subcommittee hearing. One member referred to the . actions of some employees described in the report as 'insane.' The . GM recall has triggered a deeper look at ignition switches across the . auto industry. The government has opened an investigation into . reports of defective switches in 1.2 million Chrysler vehicles. Barra made her second appearance before the committee since GM recalled 2.6 million small cars in February. As families of some of the people who died in crashes in Chevrolet Cobalts and Saturn Ions looked on, she was again pressed on whether GM's commitment to safety has changed much. 'Insane': GM CEO Mary Barra endured skepticism and some lecturing at a House subcommittee hearing where she was asked to explain why the firm has encountered so many problems. One member referred to the actions of some employees described in the report as 'insane.' Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., read a 2005 e-mail from a GM employee who had a 2006 Chevrolet Impala stall on her after its ignition slipped out of position while she was driving it. ""I'm thinking big recall,"" the employee wrote — but that recall never came until this week. Upton asked Barra what GM would do with such an e-mail if it was sent today, and Barra said GM would take ""immediate action."" Barra noted that GM has recently hired 40 more safety investors. But when she acknowledged that most of them were promoted from within GM, another member suggested GM get some 'outside fresh blood.'","The Cars, from the 2013 and 2014 models, were built with an incorrect baffle .

"By . Amanda Willliams . The birthplace of angling  - complete with a 400-year-old ‘temple’ honouring the inventor of fly-fishing - has been put on the market for £450,000. The stone temple was built in the 17th century in honour of author Izaak Walton, and as a place to rest and take shelter on the banks of the River Dove, in Staffordshire. Walton, the author of the angling 'bible', the ‘The Compleat Angler’ (sic), would spend hours on the banks with landowner Charles Cotton - who . built the retreat in 1674 in honour of his friend.  Their initials are . carved in stone about the doorway of the Grade II listed stone-built . structure. Whoever . buys the idyllic fishing retreat will not only own the three mile stretch of the riverbank, the fishing . rights, and the Grade II listed fishing lodge, but also 33 acres of  unspoilt woodland and . grassland. Tranquil: The unofficial birthplace of angling, complete with its 400 year old 'temple,'  built in the 17th century in honour of author Izaak Walton, is up for sale for £450,000 . Historic: The quaint interior of the temple with open fireplace. Walton, the author of the angling 'bible', the 'The Compleat Angler' (sic), would spend hours on the banks with landowner Charles Cotton - who built the retreat in 1674 as a place for he and his friend to shelter as they fished . The sale includes three miles of beautiful unspoiled riverbank, stretching alongside River Dove in Staffordshire . Its . current owner, 80-year-old Michael Collins, said he runs the venue more as a . hobby than a business. But now . facing retirement and with two of his three children voting to sell the . fishery, it has gone on the market. The temple has been owned by the family since 1953. Mr Collins employs a keeper to look after the fishery and maintain its banks and hopes the new owner will retain his services. He said: 'This is the cream of game fishing. It . is positioned at the head of the river where you aren’t bothered with . any coarse fish that live in the bigger rivers like pike. It is purely game fishing, trout and grayling, which are wild and are not farmed. 'It’s lovely scenery and history makes it a very sought-after venue to fish.' Walton’s tome  - the so called bible for anglers - was published in 1653 after he and his friend Cotton spent many hours experimenting with methods of fishing at the idyllic spot. The temple even bears the crest ‘Piscatoribys Sacrum’ (Sacred to Fishermen) over the door. In the mid-17th century Charles Cotton, an author, inherited Beresford Hall which was a quarter of a mile from the River Dove. Mr Collins said: 'Cotton was so impressed with Walton and the way he taught him to fish using a dry fly that he adopted him as his father in the fishing field and they became great buddies. Cotton built the retreat in 1674 in honour of . his friend Walton, left.  Walton, the author of the angling 'bible', the ‘The Compleat Angler’ (sic), would spend hours on the banks with the landowner  - who later added to the tome .

Walton's tome - the so called bible for anglers - was published in 1653 after he and his friend Cotton spent many hours experimenting with methods of fishing . Whoever buys the idyllic fishing retreat will not only own the three mile stretch of the riverbank, but also 33 acres of unspoilt woodland and grassland . 'He built the fishing lodge down by the river and their initials were carved above the door and the fire place. 'The temple is just four walls and a roof with a stone table and fire place. 'It was a place to shelter in and take a break and have a spot of lunch. You can imagine servants coming down from the main house with trays of meats and cheeses. 'Walton wrote the Compleat Angler which is the Bible for all game fishermen. 'He pretty much invented dry fly-fishing and mastered how to attract fish by laying an artificially fly on the surface of the water very gently - there is a great skill in doing this. 'He also passed on tips such as the fisherman disguising themselves in khaki colours and bending down on one knee or behind a bush.' 'When the Compleat Angler was re-published in 1676, Walton was too old to contribute to it so Cotton added new chapters about trout flies and techniques for tying them.' In 1953 Mr Collins' grandfather Walter, a keen angler, had the opportunity to buy Beresford Fishery which he passed on to his grandson in 1967. Mr Collins, a retired businessman, said: 'It is run more as a hobby and as a pleasure than a business but over the years it has paid for itself. 'There is no limit at all on the number of fishermen who can fish on it but I don’t want a 100 men fishing the river so I restrict the numbers. 'I have three children; two of them want me to sell it and the other wants to keep it but they have been outvoted.' Jonathan Bengough, of estate agents Knight Frank, said: 'The Beresford Fishery has about three miles of superb wild trout fishing on the River Dove. 'At its heart is a Fisherman’s Temple which is of huge historical significance and its three beats each have contrasting qualities, enough to challenge any keen fly fisherman.'","Stone temple was built in 17th century in honour of Izaak Walton author of angling 'bible', 'The Compleat Angler'

"By . Dr David Argus . Want to live a long and healthy life? Ditch those high heels, switch from fresh fruit to frozen — and take off all your clothes. According to a new book by one of the world’s top cancer specialists, these small changes could dramatically increase your longevity. Here we reveal some of Dr David Agus’s surprising tips . . . Familiarise yourself with your body so that you will recognise if any thing appears out of the ordinary, such as a mole or rash . Take a good look at yourself naked in front of a mirror — front and back. This will help you  spot trouble on the horizon in the form of body oddities you didn’t have before and signs of skin cancer. And once in a while, take a visual inventory of every square inch of yourself, including your hair, nails and the inside of your mouth. Do we know what these machines do to us? Where’s the long-term data to show us they are harmless? Until science can prove their safety, I’ll request a pat-down massage at airports. So should you. Inflammation has been linked to some of our most troubling degenerative diseases, including heart disease, Alzheimer’s, cancer, auto-immune diseases, diabetes and accelerated ageing. Uncomfortable shoes cause unnecessary inflammation in your feet that can have an impact on your whole system. There’s no  easier way to reduce your overall inflammation than to simply wear comfortable shoes daily. Drinking coffee in moderation not only wakes you up but could help you live longer . Drinking coffee or tea in moderation has long been shown to confer positive benefits on our health. Though researchers have tried to link caffeine consumption with illnesses such as heart disease, hypertension, osteoporosis and cancer, study after study has proven otherwise. One of the best ways of reducing stress on your body is to maintain a regular routine 365 days a year. If your body were deprived of its expected lunch at noon, apart from feeling hunger, it would experience a surge in the stress  hormone cortisol, which tells it to hold onto fat and conserve energy. So, if you don’t eat when your body anticipates food, it will sabotage your efforts to lose or maintain an ideal weight. Getting the flu can also put you at risk of other illnesses . Immunising yourself against flu isn’t just about beating the disease. Just one to two weeks of an inflammatory storm, which is  what will take place if  you contract flu, can increase your lifetime risk for obesity, heart attack, stroke and cancer. People still falsely think the vaccine has side effects, that it doesn’t work, can cause the flu or  even contains toxins or poisons. All this is rubbish! There is a profound link between more time sitting and   a greater incidence of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and early death. Way back in the Fifties, a comparison of London’s double-decker bus drivers and conductors in the Fifties found that the ticket takers, who climbed stairs all day, had a much lower incidence of heart attacks than the drivers. However, if you think you’re doing your body good with an hour-long workout before or after a long day at your desk, think again. Even two hours of exercise a day will not compensate for spending 22 hours sitting on your derriere or lying in bed. Girls born today can expect to live to nearly 83, four years longer than boys . Apart from neck and back problems, poor posture can also cause headaches, arthritis, poor circulation, muscle aches and pains, difficulty breathing, indigestion, constipation, joint stiffness, fatigue, neurological problems and poor physical function in general. All roads to perfect posture start with a sturdy core. Try exercises such as pilates designed for this. Many high-quality research studies have confirmed that the use of aspirin not only substantially reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, but it can even ward off a medley of ailments through its anti-inflammatory powers. A daily low-dose aspirin (75 milligrams) has even been shown to reduce the risk of developing common malignant cancers in the lungs, colon and prostate by a 46 per cent. But make sure that you discuss it with your doctor first as there are side effects such as stomach bleeding. We may be able to access pretty much any type of food all year long, but it comes at a cost: nutrition. By the time most of it reaches your supermarket, it doesn’t contain nearly the same amount of nutrients as when the crop was picked. Unless you can buy truly fresh local produce that’s in season, opt for frozen fruits and vegetables. They tend to be picked at their peak. Many studies on groups of more than a thousand people in the past few decades have shown that taking vitamin supplements is correlated with an increased risk of serious diseases such as cancer, and it produces little benefit to health. The body likes to create free radicals to attack ‘bad’ cells, including cancerous ones. If you block this by taking copious amounts of vitamins, especially those touted as antioxidants, you block your body’s natural ability to  control itself. Running after your children keeps you active both physically and mentally . If you have children you’ll be more likely to live longer than your childless counterparts. That’s because raising a child compels us to remain active and mentally challenged. Moderate alcohol intake, especially red wine, can reduce the risk for heart disease. Aim for no more than one drink a day if you’re a woman and two if you’re a man. Smiling will boost your mood. It will trigger the release of pain-killing, brain-happy endorphins and seratonin, which reduce harmful stress levels.

"By . Tamara Cohen, Political Correspondent . Cuts: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is in talks with NHS bosses about how to fill a £2bn gap . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is in talks with NHS bosses about how to fill a £2billion gap in its funding. Senior sources say the ageing population, the cost of new drugs and the rising pensions bill for staff has left the health service in England with the shortfall for next year. Chris Ham, head of the King’s Fund think tank, said there was a ‘real risk’ some hospitals could run out of money unless they received a significant cash injection. ‘Everywhere you look across the NHS there are pressures facing patient care,’ he told the BBC, which obtained the £2billion figure. ‘They’re having to find even bigger efficiency savings to balance the books and deliver good standards of patient care. That’s a very, very big ask.’ The NHS budget for England for 2015 is around £100billion. David Cameron has not ring-fenced spending on the health service and its budget has risen only by the rate of inflation – without taking into account the rising population and other cost pressures. Mr Cameron played down concerns at Prime Minister’s Questions yesterday, saying efficiency targets for the NHS had been met every year, and the cash ploughed back into frontline care. Anita Charlesworth of the Health Foundation think tank said the health service had been doing well at making savings. But she added: ‘There is a “pincer” – as the NHS takes on more nurses, drug prices are rising and their pension costs are rising, as part of government policy. 'We’re not going to find this money behind the sofa, so it would mean the Treasury stepping in. If it can’t do that, we’re faced with cutting services and cutting quality.’ The Department of Health said: ‘The NHS is on track to make £20billion savings this parliament and we are confident it will continue to make the savings necessary to meet rising demand.’ Meanwhile, some Liberal Democrat ministers are understood to be pushing for an increase in the NHS budget. Proposals: GPs rejected a move to charge patients for appointments to improve attendance (file photo) Leader Nick Clegg is being lobbied by those who think the party should call for more borrowing or spending cuts elsewhere to fund vital health services. A source said: ‘We could differentiate ourselves from the Conservatives on something the public really care about for a change.’ GPs and nurses’ leaders have suggested charging patients for appointments, in part to save money.  Earlier this year, GPs held a vote on charging for appointments at the British Medical Association’s local medical committee conference in York. The idea was to deter patients from missing consultations – a problem that costs £160million a year. The fees – possibly between £10 and £25 – would be the first since the NHS was founded in 1948. Although the GPs rejected the idea, it has not gone away. Yesterday the Royal College of Nursing’s annual conference in Liverpool debated whether patients should be charged up to £10 for seeing their GP. Nurses who put forward the motion said that NHS finances were ‘not infinite’. Once again, the motion was defeated. But its very presence on the conference agenda show it is an increasingly live issue.","Gap reportedly caused by ageing patients, costly drugs and rising pensions .

"By . Sam Webb . The boxer turned political heavyweight Vitali Klitschko has today called on demonstrators occupying the square that became the flashpoint for the   troubles in the Ukraine to fold up their tents and go home. The newly-elected mayor of Kiev and former world heavyweight boxing champion spoke with dissenters and self-defence members at a mass gathering on Independence Square - or Maidan - telling them he plans to create a representative body for them in the city council. He also promised to take his   oath to Ukrainian people on the Maidan. Last week Klitschko promised to dismantle the iconic protest encampment that had helped oust a pro-Russian leader because Kiev residents are losing patience   with the disruption and the effect it has on traffic. Political heavyweight: Kiev city mayor-elect Vitalii Klitschko argues with Maidan activists prior to the rally on Independence Square in Kiev today . He told the activists he plans to create a representative body of the Maidan in the city council . Even after the May 25 election for a president to replace the interim leader who took power amid chaos in February, many Ukrainians remain deeply   suspicious of the government, and several hundred are still holding out at the vast protest camp. Three months of protests during the winter eventually drove pro-Russia president Viktor Yanukovych to flee the country. But the extensive protest tent   camp and the barricades of wooden pallets, tires and trash that protected the camp remained even after interim president Oleksandr Turchynov was   appointed. many Ukrainians remain deeply suspicious of the government, and several hundred are still holding out at a vast protest camp . The holdouts say they want to keep up the encampment until the new government and president-elect Petro Poroshenko carry out important reforms in a   country long riddled by corruption. 'Personally, I have no plans to leave. They need to show the people that the new laws are working - they're where they are thanks to us,' said   demonstrator Anna Chaikovska, from the Rivna region in western Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly criticised the Ukrainian authorities for failing to clear out the encampment and free buildings occupied by demonstrators, which   was among the terms stated in an agreement reached between Russia, Ukraine, the United States and the European Union in April aimed at cooling tensions   in Ukraine's crisis. In Ukraine's east, where separatists have declared two provinces independent and are fighting government forces, many are deeply suspicious of the Kiev   demonstrations and the new government they have propelled to power. The conflict between government forces and the insurgents in the east escalated markedly in the last week, including rebels' attempt to seize the   airport in the city of Donetsk on Monday and the shooting down of a Ukrainian military helicopter on Thursday. Twelve people, including a general, died   in that incident.  On Saturday, Russia's Foreign Ministry criticised a suggestion by an official from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that it could   withdraw its observer mission from Ukraine because of safety concerns, as shooting between government troops and pro-Russian rebels continued in the   region. The international monitoring body says it lost contact on Thursday with a group of five monitors in separatist eastern Ukraine. Another four-member team   has been held by eastern rebels since Monday. Russia has repeatedly criticised the Ukrainian authorities for failing to clear out the encampment and free buildings occupied by demonstrators . The holdouts say they want to keep up the encampment until the new government carry out important reforms . Wolfgang Ischinger, the OSCE's negotiator on national dialogue in Ukraine, told German broadcaster ZDF this week that the monitor mission might have to   withdraw if the organisation fears for its employees' lives. But the Russian ministry said in a statement Saturday that 'amid Kiev's intentionally intensified punitive operation in the east of the country, it is   essential to step up the work of international observers.' Confrontations continued Saturday between government troops and the rebels, who have seized administrative and police buildings across the east and want   to join the region to Russia.

Three months of protests during the winter eventually drove pro-Russia president Viktor Yanukovych to flee the country . At a government-controlled checkpoint in the city of Sloviansk, which has been the epicentre of the conflict, troops came under fire but repelled the   attack. No casualties were reported in the latest attempt to break the army's ring of checkpoints around the city. Vladislav Seleznev, press secretary for Ukraine's anti-insurgent operation in the east, said Saturday that the army had successfully destroyed a cannon   in Slovyansk, which he said rebels had been using to shell civilian buildings in the town. As violence escalated in the region, the Ukrainian and pro-Russian sides have blamed each other for the rising number of civilian casualties in the   conflict.

"By . Chris Pleasance . President Barack Obama has asked Congress for $500million to arm moderate Syrian rebels in the latest effort to tackle ISIS militants . President Barack Obama has asked Congress for $500million to arm and equip moderate rebel groups in Syria in the latest effort to combat the sudden rise of ISIS. Obama has previously been reluctant to arm rebel groups amid fears that weapons could fall into the wrong hands, but gains by ISIS militants in the past weeks now appear to trump those concerns. A lighting-fast offensive by ISIS saw the fundamentalist Islamic group seize huge swathes of territory in Iraq to add to the land it already controlled in Syria. The group now controls most of the country's northwest, including all border crossings with Syria, and is fighting in Fallujah, just 40 miles from capital Baghdad, prompting fears the country's security forces could be overrun. The train-and-equip mission would be overseen by the Pentagon and would mark a significant expansion of previous covert efforts to arm moderate rebels fighting both the extremists and forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad. Moderate groups fighting in Syria include the Supreme Military Council of the Free Syrian Army, the Syrian Islamic Liberation Front, and the Islamic Front - though it is feared this group could collaborate with more extreme groups. Officials say the U.S. has grown increasingly confident in recent months about its ability to distinguish the moderate rebels from the more extremist elements that include the al-Qaida-inspired Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, or ISIS. White House spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said the military assistance 'marks another step toward helping the Syrian people defend themselves against regime attacks, push back against the growing number of extremists like ISIS who find safe haven in the chaos, and take their future into their own hands by enhancing security and stability at local levels.' Obama has previously warned against arming rebel groups amid fears that weapons could fall into the wrong hands - however the security threat from ISIS now appears to trump those concerns . The president's cautious approach to Syria has come under increased criticism as the civil war, now in its fourth year, spills across the border into Iraq, with White House opponents arguing that Obama's reluctance to arm the rebels gave ISIS space to operate. Like the more moderate Syrian rebels, ISIS is seeking to push Assad from power, aiming to carve out a purist Islamic enclave across both sides of the Syria-Iraq border. With ISIS gaining strength, U.S. officials say Assad's forces launched airstrikes on extremist targets inside Iraq on Monday. Obama has ruled out sending U.S. troops back into combat in Iraq. But he has dispatched nearly 600 U.S. forces in and around Iraq to train local forces and secure the American Embassy in Baghdad. Officials said the administration would coordinate with Congress and regional players on the specific types of training and assistance the U.S. would provide the opposition. One potential option would be to base U.S. personnel in Jordan and conduct the training exercise there. In addition to the covert train-and-equip mission, the U.S. has also provided nearly $287million in nonlethal assistance to the moderate opposition. The military program would be . supplemented by $1 billion in assistance to Syria's neighbors — Jordan, . Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq — to help them deal with an influx of refugees . and the threat of extremists spilling over their borders. The Syria program is part of a broader . $65.8 billion overseas operations request that the administration sent . to Capitol Hill on Thursday. This week: ISIS has now seized every border crossing between Iraq and Syria, allowing tanks and troops to pass across unimpeded, and controls much of Iraq's north . The . package includes $1 billion to help stabilize nations bordering Syria . that are struggling with the effects of the civil war. It . also formalizes a request for a previously announced $1 billion to . strengthen the U.S. military presence in Central and Eastern Europe amid . Russia's threatening moves in Ukraine. The Russian ambassador to the United Nations criticized Obama's announcement, saying it would just drag out the conflict and that it was 'moving things in the wrong direction.' 'I think that this is an extremely big risk, and frankly a waste,' Ambassador Vitaly Churkin told reporters at the U.N., saying weapons and money could fall into the hands of the ISIL. He said the U.S. and Russia, which has been Assad's most powerful international backer during the war, should be focusing on restarting political negotiations to end the conflict. The instability in Iraq comes as Obama continues to grapple with a crisis in Ukraine, with Russia widely believed to be backing pro-Moscow insurgents in eastern Ukrainian cities. Russia's threats have stoked anxiety among U.S. allies in the region, who are seeking deeper military assistance from the U.S. Obama has previously cautioned against arming rebels in Syria amid fears that weapons could fall into the wrong hands, but the threat of ISIS now appears to have changed his mind. According to reports, the U.S. is increasingly confident in its ability to tell the more moderate groups from the fundamentalists - so who is likely to get the weapons and who will they be used against? Moderates . Supreme Military Command . The SMC was created as an umbrella group to unite the various elements of the former Free Syrian Army as the West called for united leadership among Syria's rebels at the end of last year. Fighters for the SMC come largely from army deserters based in Turkey, led by Col Riad al-Asaad. The group has backing from Western powers such as the United States, as well as Turkey and Gulf Arab countries, but has never been able to shake the impression that it is being lead from abroad. While still functioning nominally, the SMC was dealt a heavy blow by the formation of the Islamic Front alliance in November 2013, which deprived it of some of its largest members and allies. Fighters from the Free Syrian Army - now the Supreme Military Command - pictured in Aleppo in 2012 . Syrian Revolutionaries Front . This alliance of rebel units helped to launch the Syrian campaign against hardline ISIS fighters. The backbone of the group is the Syrian Martyrs Brigade, a once powerful group from the northern province of Idlib led by Jamal Maarouf. Unlike most other rebel formations, the group does not appear to have strong ideological leanings. The SRF is believed to receive funding from large Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia. It has poor relations with the Islamic Front but has expressed support for the SMC. Mujahideen Army . This recent formation of eight Syrian militant groups was announced early in January and almost immediately launched a campaign against ISIS, leading many observers to believe it may have been formed by Gulf Arab backers to challenging the radical Islamist group. The Mujahideen Army, which claims to have 5,000 members, is seen as moderately Islamist. This relatively new group, along with the Syrian Revolutionaries' Front, spearheaded the campaign against ISIS. Borderline . Islamic front . An amalgam of six major Islamist . groups, this alliance is believed to be the biggest rebel army working . in Syria. Its formation last November gutted the Western-backed Syrian . Military Council, depriving it of some of its main members. Analysts . say the number of fighters brought together by the Front is between . 40,000 to 50,000. The . Islamic Front has been involved in fighting with ISIS, making it a possible target for U.S. weapons, but many of its members are hardline Sunni Islamists who want Syria to . become an Islamic state. Fundamentalists . ISIS . ISIS was formed by breakaway elements from the Nusra Front, Al-Qaeda's official affiliate in Syria, which joined with Al-Qaeda's Iraq branch. The group is headed by the Iraq branch's leader, known as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. ISIS is the most hardline of all the Islamist forces in Syria and has made enemies of several rebel groups since it seized many towns and checkpoints in opposition areas. It aims to create an Islamic Sharia state stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to Iran, and stepped closer to that objective this week after seizing all border crossing between Syria and Iraq. ISIS militants launched a bloody offensive on Iraq from Syria attempting to establish a Sharia state spanning both countries . Nusra Front . This powerful rebel group is comprised of both Syrians and foreign militants and has been formally recognized by the central leadership of al Qaeda as its franchise in Syria. The group was one of the first to use techniques such as suicide attacks and car bombings in urban areas. Despite this, it is seen as more tolerant and less heavy handed in its dealings with civilians and other rebel groups in comparison with ISIL. The Nusra Front, estimated at around 7,000 to 8,000 members, has worked with most rebel factions fighting in Syria but follows an austere version of Islam and calls for the creation of an Islamic state.","Obama plans to arm moderate rebel groups in Syria to combat rise of ISIS .

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . The sense of courtliness that is as synonymous with Royal Ascot as top hats and tail coats has not always extended from British princes to visiting aristocrats. The Prince of Wales — a few ago — once spied the Duke of Orleans peering at the fish in an ornamental pond and pushed him in. His finery took almost as long to repair as Anglo-French relations. Not so here yesterday when the jewel in the season rolled out its most verdant green carpet to welcome Qatar’s rulers and their infinite zillions. This was the day when Qatar, whose winter the footballing world are hoping to avoid, imprinted themselves on our summer. In the parade ring, close to the Royal Ascot signs with their crowns, were the five letters: QIPCO, shorthand for Qatar Investment & Projects Development Holding Company. Sheikh Joaan (right) with Richard Hughes and the Queen Anne Stakes winner Toronado . QIPCO are Ascot’s ‘partners’ and strictly not ‘sponsors’ with that word’s vulgarian overtones. What precisely the owner — Her Majesty — thinks of this is unknown, but apparently all major commercial projects are ‘briefed in to Buckingham Palace’. Discretion has limited the size and scale of the advertising. But the Al Thani ruling family of Qatar, in the shape of two 20-something-year-old cousins, let their results do the talking for them. The first of the cousins is Sheik Joaan, the brother of the Emir of Qatar and something of an Omar Sharif of the Turf. In his dark shades, grey tails and pointy black shoes, he was phlegmatic throughout the afternoon. The first victory for his Al Shaqab Stable came in the opening race, the Queen Anne Stakes, when the 4-5 favourite Toronado was a convincing winner. He smiled calmly, as he did following his second win in the next race, the Coventry Stakes, when Frankie Dettori rode The Wow Signal to his 48th Royal Ascot winner. The other, slightly younger, cousin — a . rival in racing, though they share some horses — is the slightly less . svelte Sheik Fahad. He owns Qatar Racing (or Pearl Bloodstock) and his . approach is more conservative than that of Sheik Joaan, the big spender. But for good measure Fahad, in black tail coat, claimed a second and a . third place yesterday. The Al Shaqab silks were carried to glory by Frankie Dettori on board The Wow Signal in the Coventry Stakes . This is only the start of this Qatari phenomenon that is turning racing upside down. Already they have invested more than $100billion on Harrods, Heathrow, Volkswagen, Al Jazeera and Paris St-Germain football club. They are fresh to thoroughbred racing but are not new to the sport or to England. Both cousins, like so many from the region, speak the Queen’s English. Both were educated here. ‘I grew up with racing,’ said Sheik . Joaan, who turns 28 next month. ‘It started in 1991 so it has been quite . a long time.’ Yes, his father started Al Shaqab Stable in their . homeland, a distant precursor to this move into Europe. Sheikh Joaan and Frankie Dettori celebrate The Wow Signal's brilliant Coventry Stakes win . Harry Herbert (right), Sheikh Joaan's racing adviser, chats to actor High Bonneville . ‘He very much sees Al Shaqab as representing a good face of his country,’ said Harry Herbert, Sheikh Joaan’s racing adviser, the son of the Queen’s former racing manager, the Earl of Caernarvon.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Scientists tracked people's emotions by measuring changes in facial muscles linked with smiling (pictured) and found the most positive letter is 'i' The words you use can have a powerful effect on people, but new research suggests its not the words themselves that carry meaning, but instead its the individual letters. And researchers from Germany found the articulation of vowels, in particular, influence how we feel. During tests, they tracked participants' emotions by measuring changes in facial muscles linked with smiling and frowning, and found the most positive letter is 'i'. Meanwhile, the letter that holds the most negative connotations is 'o'. The team, led by the Erfurt-based psychologist Professor Ralf Rummer and the Cologne-based phoneticist Professor Martine Grice were able to demonstrate the articulation of vowels systematically influences our feelings, but also vice versa. The research project looked at the question of whether, and to what extent, the meaning of words is linked to their sound. The specific focus of the project was on two special cases; the sound of the long 'i' vowel (/i:/) and that of the long, closed 'o' vowel (/o:/). Professors Rummer and Grice were particularly interested in finding out whether these vowels tend to occur in words that are positively or negatively charged in terms of emotional impact. In the first experiment, the researchers asked test subjects to watch film clips designed to put them in a positive or a negative mood, and then asked them to make up ten artificial words themselves, and to speak these out loud. They found the artificial words that contained significantly more '/i:/'s than '/o:/'s when the test subjects were in a positive mood. Scientists found that the letter that holds the most negative connotations is 'o', having tracked people's emotions by measuring changes in their facial muscles while frowining (pictured). The letter 'o' more often occurs in negative words, such as 'alone' Scientists measured changes in facial muscles linked with smiling and frowning to find that the most positive letter is 'i'. The letter that hold the most negative connotations is 'o'. The team demonstrated that the articulation of vowels systematically influences our feelings, and vice versa. 'I' sounds often occur in positive words, such as 'like', while 'o' sounds are typically found in negative words, such as 'alone'. The second experiment was used to determine whether the different emotional quality of the two vowels can be traced back to the movements of the facial muscles associated with their articulation. Participants were asked to articulate an 'i' sound, which contracts the zygomaticus major muscle linked with smiling, or an 'o' sound, which contracts the frowning orbicularis oris muscle, every second while watching cartoons. The test subjects producing the 'i' sounds found the same cartoons significantly more amusing than those producing the 'o' sounds instead. The conclude that the tendency for 'i' sounds to occur in positively charged words, such as 'like', and for 'o' sounds to occur in negatively charged words, such as 'alone', in many languages appears to be linked to the corresponding use of facial muscles. With the articulation of vowels on the one hand and the expression of emotion on the other. The results were published in . Emotion, the journal of the American Psychological Association.","Researchers in Germany said articulation of vowels influences our feelings .

She wrote on her Facebook page: 'Hi Lovers, thanks to all of you for your incredible support throughout this past season of The Voice UK.

'I’m sad to say that, due to the timing of my European tour, I won’t be back for Season 4. I absolutely loved my time on the show, and I’ll miss all of the incredible people who were a part of my experience. 'I hope to see you all on my Kiss Me Once tour, and wish continued success to everyone at The Voice!' She added on Twitter: #Lovers, due to timing of my tour I won’t be back next season for The Voice UK. Thanks to all who supported! Hope to see you on my KMO tour!' The 45-year-old singer joined the panel with fellow newcomer Ricky Wilson, sitting alongside veteran coaches will.i.am and Sir Tom Jones.

'Kylie has brought her own very special magic to The Voice UK and we . have loved having her on the show. We wish her well for her tour and . hope to welcome her back in the future.' Kylie performed on the final night last weekend with her act Jamie Johnson, but the contest was eventually won by Jermain Jackman.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Despite the sun being 93 million miles (150 million kilometres) away, one amateur astronomer hasn't let that stop him capturing incredible close ups - from his back garden. Dutch stargazer Ivar Kooren used off the shelf equipment to capture a series of stunning images. They include bursts of flames, known as prominences, flickering from the sun's surface that are only visible when the sun is most active. Dutch amateur astronomer Ivar Kooren has captured incredible images of the sun (pictured) from his own back garden using off the shelf equipment. The images include bursts of flames - known as prominences - flickering from the suns surface . 'The pictures are captured in my own backyard,' said Kooren. 'My backyard lays north so I can see pretty good to the east where the sun rises in the morning - the best time to capture these types of images.' A solar prominence is a large, bright feature extending outward from the Sun's surface. A prominence forms over timescales of about a day, and the red-glowing looped material is plasma, a hot gas comprised of electrically charged hydrogen and helium. An erupting prominence occurs when such a structure becomes unstable and bursts outward, releasing the plasma. He admitted that the images are difficult to capture, so he used specialist techniques to produce the final versions. Using what he terms an astrocamera, set to capture thousands of pictures in less than 30 seconds, and H-alpha filters, Kooren is able to select the frames that are sharp. He then stacks and overlays them using specialist software, producing one clear image. Ivar said he has got the technique down to a fine art after three years of work. 'It takes a lot of practice to capture these pictures,' he said. Seen here is a prominence extending from the sun's surface in one of Kooren's pictures. A solar prominence is a large, bright feature extending outward from the Sun's surface. A prominence forms over timescales of about a day, and the red-glowing looped material is plasma .

'There are lots of challenges such as the warmth of a summers day can ruin the capture by causing ""vibrations"" across the image. 'Even with the most expensive equipment it is still a challenge to take a decent picture. 'I see lots of people with the most expensive equipment, but they are still unable to capture a proper picture. 'You need lots of patience, and one has got to learn what there is to see on the sun itself, too. 'It has taken me a lot of practice, but to make a full image I now only need five minutes of clear sky. 'I shoot four images in total, two of which are of the sun's surface and two more of the prominence, before stacking these together to create on sharp image.'

"By . Jason Groves . The cost of the Welfare State has risen 12-fold in real terms since its introduction, figures reveal today – as George Osborne prepares to unveil a benefits freeze. Figures released by the Department for Work and Pensions to mark the 70th anniversary of William Beveridge’s landmark report on welfare, show the cost of the modern system dwarfs that of his original vision. They come as the Chancellor puts the finishing touches to next week’s Autumn Statement on the economy, when he is expected to announce a freeze in the value of most benefits apart from pensions and disability payments. Welfare squeeze: Chancellor George Osborne is set to unveil a benefits freeze in his Autumn Statement next week . The move is part of Mr Osborne’s drive to tackle Britain’s budget deficit. He is also expected to ease pressure on family budgets by cancelling the 3p rise in fuel duty due to come in next month. The new figures reveal that benefit spending has increased dramatically since Beveridge’s proposals were introduced in 1948, rising from the equivalent of £13.5billion in today’s prices to £165.5billion this year – more than a 12-fold increase. Even given the huge growth in the economy over the past seven decades, the increase in the cost of the benefits system has been dramatic. In 1948 spending on benefits accounted for 10.4 per cent of Britain’s total income, against 24.2 per cent this year. Unemployment benefit: It pays not to work these days, as Jobseekers Allowance has nearly doubled since 1948 from £37.30 in today's money, to £71 . Lost vision: Iain Duncan Smith believes the current system is no longer in touch with the Beveridge report's original idea of the Welfare State . Jobseeker’s Allowance has almost doubled in real terms from £37.30 a week for the 1948 unemployment benefit to £71 today. At the same time the basic state pension has almost trebled from £37.30 to £107.45. Yet over the same period the price of a pint of milk has fallen in real terms from 57p to 46p. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain . Duncan Smith said the soaring cost underlined the fact that the welfare . system had lost touch with Beveridge’s original vision of ensuring . ‘freedom from want’. ‘Beveridge’s pioneering vision for welfare has been completely lost,’ he said. ‘The system is complicated, expensive and open to abuse. ‘Our reforms will restore confidence and bring the benefits system back to Beveridge’s founding principles. ‘We will deliver his vision of a Welfare State that provides a safety net for those who need it, without stifling incentive, opportunity or responsibility.’ In October, Mr Duncan Smith said that spending on benefits and tax credits had risen by more than 60 per cent under the previous Labour government – spiralling even before the recession, when growth was booming, jobs were being created, and welfare bills should have been falling. By 2010, the extra spending was costing every household in the country an extra £3,000 a year in tax, helping to increase the budget deficit..","Welfare State has risen 12 fold in 70 years from £13.5billion in to £165.5billion .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A woman claimed she had been raped by her ex-boyfriend in a bid to cover up a drunken threesome with two men she met in a pub, it was alleged. Lisa Yapp, 24, showed the men naked photographs of herself then went to one of their homes where they had sex in the kitchen, a court heard. She ‘high-fived’ the men as she left afterwards. But Yapp later turned up at a friend’s house in tears saying she had been raped. A court heard Lisa Yapp accused her ex-boyfriend of raping her to cover up the shame of having a threesome . She claimed she had been attacked in an alleyway by her former partner Gavin Hockey, jurors heard.Police began a major investigation after Yapp told officers the attacker had ‘sounded and felt’ like him. But Mr Hockey had been 30 miles away at the time and was seen on CCTV on a night out with friends. Yapp was arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. Prosecutor Andrew Wilkins told Worcester Crown Court: ‘Why she lied we might never know, it might be because she felt guilty. Yapp, pictured with an unidentified man, went to a friend's house claiming she'd been raped, the court heard . ‘It might be that she wanted to get back at her former boyfriend.’ The court heard Yapp got talking to friends Matthew Stevens and Terry Lippett in the Goodrest Tavern in Worcester on August 1, 2011. Mr Stevens told the court that after the talk turned to issues of a sexual nature, Yapp showed them naked photographs and the three went to his home. There, she showed them more photographs before stripping off and telling them she had taken part in orgies. Mr Stevens told the trial he had sex with Yapp in the kitchen while Mr Lippett groped her. Yapp was arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice . ‘I was a bit shocked,’ he told the jury. ‘Afterwards I thought, “I can’t believe what just happened”. I was a bit embarrassed to be honest.’ Yapp claimed she had been raped in an alley near her home in Ronkswood, Worcester. She told police: ‘I knew someone was walking behind me and I started walking a bit faster. ‘I felt his fist hit the back of my head and he pushed my back down. He grabbed hold of my hair and with his other hand he pulled my trousers down.’ She said she had screamed and tried to fight back and claimed her attacker shouted, ‘I told you I’d get you for it.’ Yapp told police she believed the attack was revenge because she had previously made allegations of rape against Mr Hockey which were subsequently dropped. But a medical examination found no sign that she had been attacked and evidence from CCTV and witnesses showed she had left the pub with two men in the opposite direction to the alley, the court heard. Yapp later claimed to police that she suffered from blackouts but still maintained she had been raped. She denies perverting the course of justice. The trial continues.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company will share several hundred patents and won't sue those who use them. 'If we clear a path to the creation of compelling electric vehicles, but then lay intellectual property landmines behind us to inhibit others, we are acting in a manner contrary to that goal,' Musk wrote in a blog on the company's Web site. Scroll down for video . Tesla CEO and co-founder Elon Musk with he Tesla Motors Model X electric vehicle, which will launch next year. Today he announced the is giving other companies open access to its patents to accelerate the development of electric vehicles. Currently, Tesla has about 100 'Supercharger' stations scattered across North America and Europe that give Model S drivers a free power source when traveling long distances. The technology is designed to replenish about half of the battery power within 20 minutes. Tesla recently opened three Supercharger stations in China and plans to set up about 200 more around the world, including Japan, by the end of the year. Electric cars currently make up only a tiny fraction of all U.S. auto sales. Drivers are concerned about their range, and stable gasoline prices have also hurt sales. Entering this year, Tesla had been issued 203 patents covering its batteries and other key features that distinguish its electric cars from gasoline-powered vehicles. Tesla currently makes one vehicle - the Model S sedan - and is developing two others. Its Model X crossover is due out next year. Another 280 patent applications are still pending in the U.S. and other countries, according to Tesla's regulatory filings. The earliest any of Tesla's current patents expires is in 2026, so the Palo Alto, California, company is relinquishing a potentially valuable long-term advantage by giving away its intellectual property to its rivals. Musk says the patents could be a 'modest' help to other companies developing electric cars. He says Tesla has gotten few requests for technology from rivals, but he thinks that's partly because the patents were blocking access. Nissan, which makes the electric Leaf, said it had no comment on Tesla's action. The Leaf only goes 84 miles on a battery charge, compared with up to 265 miles with a Model S. But the Model S has a much larger battery and, with a starting price of $70,000, costs twice as much as a Leaf. The Tesla Model S P85, costing from £68,700 in the UK. It's technology will be free for other car makers to use . Prashand Kumta, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh's school of engineering, said Tesla's lithium-ion battery technology isn't unique. But how the company packages that technology and designs its cars could be useful to other companies. The patents also protect some of the technology Tesla uses to recharge its cars after the battery has been drained. Currently, Tesla has about 100 'Supercharger' stations scattered across North America and Europe that give Model S drivers a free power source when traveling long distances. The technology is designed to replenish about half of the battery power within 20 minutes. Tesla recently opened three Supercharger stations in China and plans to set up about 200 more around the world, including Japan, by the end of the year. If the release of Tesla's patents encourages major automakers to build more electric cars, it also might spur the creation of more charging stations. That, in turn, could save Tesla money and help drive more sales of its sedans if consumers are less anxious about running out of power while on the road. The release of Tesla's patents may also might spur the creation of more charging stations. That, in turn, could save Tesla money and help drive more sales of its sedans if consumers are less anxious about running out of power while on the road. 'I think Superchargers could be a great area for collaboration and creating a common industry platform,' Musk said. He said Tesla discussed a potential Superchargers partnership with BMW in a Wednesday night meeting.Musk says sharing the technology could accelerate development and solidify Tesla's leadership in the market. Some analysts agreed. 'By opening its patents, Tesla rightly realizes it's better to be the best product in a large industry than the only product in a niche one,' observed Silicon Valley entrepreneur Aaron Levie, the CEO of file-storing company Box Inc., in a Thursday post on his Twitter account.","Tesla Motors to give open access to its patents .

"By . Ryan Gorman . A former mayor of Miami Beach who spent time behind bars for accepting bribes and tax evasion is now pleading poverty as his daughter fights in court to evict him from a million-dollar home. Alex Daoud, 71, served 18 months in prison during the 1990s for tax evasion, accepting bribes and obstructing an investigation into his activities. Daughter Kelly Hyman insists she owns the house and wants him evicted. Hyman’s name is on the deed because a bank advised Daoud to put the property in her name due to his poor credit and lack of income outside of social security benefits, he told the Miami Herald. Better days: Alex Daoud (center) with daughter Kelly Hyman (left) and son Alexander Daoud at a 2006 appearance after releasing his book . ‘I am 71 and in poor health,’ he said. ‘I am not going to make it much longer. Couldn’t she just wait until I die?’ Daoud, who served as mayor of the resort town from 1985 to 1991, claims he will be homeless if he loses the two-bedroom, three-bathroom house only blocks from the water, but his daughter disagrees. ‘He has the financial means to find a suitable and comparable place to live or he can live in the Gardens Apartments, which is where he lived before I acquired the house,’ she told the paper. Alex Brito, the ex-con’s lawyer, says he is the only one who has paid the mortgage on the home, which he shares with a German Shepherd. The home: This million dollar house is at the center of the family feud . Miami Vice: Daoud seated between two unnamed individuals during his term as mayor of Miami Beach . Daoud moved into the home in 2005 after forming Bouganvilla Investments with his daughter, who is listed as the incorporator and president of the company. ‘His credit was shot and he wanted to lay low,’ Brito said. Bouganvilla acquired the property only after suing the previous owner when he tried to back out of an agreement to sell. Hyman claims the suit was only settled so she could buy the property. The shamed politician removed Hyman’s name from the deed soon after moving in, setting off a legal battle that has gone on since 2006. ‘“I trusted her,’ said Daoud. ‘I loved her. I still love her.’ He wanted to lay low because he was afraid of dying while behind bars after cutting a deal with the government to wear a wire and help gather evidence against his co-conspirators after being hit with 41 criminal charges. Hobnobbing with the jetset: Daoud pictured standing behind Muhammed Ali . No longer smiling: The father and daughter are locked in a bitter court battle over the home . The deal reduced his five-year sentence but left him broke when he left prison in 1995. Daoud claims he spent over $1million on his legal defense. The former lawyer also lost his law license and his wife filed for divorce. ‘I made a lot of mistakes in my life,’ Daoud admitted. Those mistakes included taking kickbacks and not paying taxes, and once the ball started rolling he was unable to turn back. ‘One thing led to another,’ he recalled. The shady backroom dealings were detailed in a self-published 2006 book he says generates very little income. ‘I’ll be homeless,’ he said. ‘I have nothing left.’ Hyman, who is married to a bankruptcy judge, remains undeterred in her fight to take the home from her father. A judge will decide who owns the property later this year.","Alex Daoud's daughter Kelly Hyman wants him evicted from a million dollar home just blocks from the beach .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A backlash against U.S. gun culture appears to have started in Hollywood and the business world  in the wake of the Sandy Hook school massacre. Scenes have reportedly been cut from the new Tom Cruise film Jack Reacher with movie studio Paramount moving swiftly to review its promotional materials before the picture's release on Friday. It follows gunman Adam Lanza killing of 26 people in cold blood, including 20 children 1st grade children at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut last Friday. Scenes cut: Tom Cruise (left) and British actress Rosemund Pike pose upon their arrival to the premiere of the film Jack Reacher in Madrid, Spain. Reports suggest the film has been re-cut after the Sandy Hook massacre . Selling up: New York-based private equity firm Cerberus, pictured, is selling its stake in Freedom Group, the company that made the Bushmaster rifle Adam Lanza used to slaughter innocent children and school staff . Paramount has decided to make several tweaks to the marketing materials for Jack Reacher, the gritty crime-action pic starring Cruise as a hard-boiled former military cop trying to prove that an alleged sniper was framed. The studio wouldn't officially say what the changes are, but a source told The Hollywood Reporter that a scene of Cruise's character firing off a semi-automatic weapon is being cut from promotional spots. Jack Reacher, rated PG-13 and opening with sniper fire, isn't the only Christmas movie laced with violence. Django Unchained, opening Christmas Day, is directed by Quentin Tarantino, known for his over-the-top violence. The R-rated Django stars Jamie Foxx as a slave promised his freedom if he helps a bounty hunter played by Christoph Waltz track down a plantation owner played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Yesterday, The Weinstein Co announced it was cancelling tonight's Django premiere in Los Angeles because of the school tragedy. 'Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut, and in this time of national mourning we have decided to forgo our scheduled event,' the company said in a statement, adding that it would still hold a screening for cast and crew. Insensitive: It was felt having a premiere of the violent western Django Unchained would not be the right thing to do . Bushmaster: Nguyen allegedly bought the Bushmaster rifle, pictured, for William Spengler and he used it to shoot two firefighters . Weapons: The Bushmaster assault rifle, owned by . Nancy Lanza, pictured left, but used by Adam Lanza, right, in Friday's . school shooting has been pulled from shelves as Cerberus sells its stake . in the  gun manufacturer . At a junket for Django on Saturday in New York, Tarantino said he is weary of defending the violence in his movies. 'I just think there's violence in the world. Tragedies happen,' the filmmaker said. '[Django} is a Western. Give me a break.' In scrubbing the Django premiere, The Weinstein Co. was following the cue of Paramount, which postponed Saturday's planned Jack Reacher premiere in Pittsburgh until Wednesday. Respect: Chain store Dick's Sporting Goods, pictured, is pulling certain semi-automatic rifles from its shelves after the Sandy Hook school shooting . Pulling guns: Walmart, pictured, has also removed certain guns from its shelves since the shooting . It was also revealed the business world has reacted to the massacre with U.S. private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management saying it will sell its stake in the maker of the AR15 rifle, the weapon used in the Newtown school shootings. Cerberus Capital Management's move came after pressure from one of its own biggest investors, the California State Teachers' Retirement System (Calstrs). Cerberus bought Bushmaster in 2006, and more gunmakers since, merging them into Freedom Group, which it will now sell. The firm said it wanted to avoid being drawn into the gun control controversy. Watershed: Cerberus is selling its stake in the company that made the Bushmaster rifle used by Lanza in the shootings at the elementary school, pictured, calling it a watershed event' in the national debate on gun control . Victims: A display of wooden crosses, and a Jewish Star of David, represented the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting on Monday . 'We believe that this decision allows us to meet our obligations to the investors whose interests we are entrusted to protect without being drawn into the national debate that is more properly pursued by those with the formal charter and public responsibility to do so,' Cerberus said in a statement. 'We do not believe that Freedom Group or any single company or individual can prevent senseless violence or the illegal use or procurement of firearms and ammunition,' the firm added, noting that Freedom Group only sold weapons to federally licensed dealers and distributors, and not directly to U.S. citizens. Freedom Group claims to be the world's largest manufacturer of commercial firearms, selling over two billion rounds of ammunition each year. As well as Bushmaster, the maker of the AR15 rifle, Freedom Group also owns Remington, the oldest U.S. gunmaker established in 1816, and seven other gun arms manufacturers, as well as majority stakes in two clothing companies specialising in hunting and paramilitary apparel. The group made profits before tax of $2.7million in the 12 months to September 2012, on $875million of sales. Calstrs, which is the second largest pension fund in the U.S., had said on Monday that it was reviewing its own $750million (£460million) investment in Cerberus in light of the deaths of 20 school children and seven adults including teachers at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut last Friday. Cerberus, which is one of the biggest private equity firms in the world with over $20bn of assets under management, said that the shootings represented 'a watershed event that has raised the national debate on gun control to an unprecedented level'. Proceeds from the sale of Freedom Group would be returned to Cerberus' investors, and not reinvested by the firm. According to CNN, Dick's Sporting Goods, . one of the largest sporting goods retailers in the world, has removed . all guns from its store nearest to Newtown, Connecticut, and is . suspending the sale of certain kinds of semi-automatic rifles from its . chains nationwide. Lanza reportedly tried to buy a gun from . a Dick's Sporting Goods store in the city of Danbury, about 12 miles . away from Newtown, prior to the killings. The company said the reports hadn't . been confirmed but it was suspending the sale of so-called 'modern . sporting rifles' out of respect for the victims and families of the . Sandy Hook school shooting. Meanwhile, Walmart has taken the assault-rifle model Lanza used to gun down his victims off its online store. According to the New York Post, the . rifle had been available on Walmart's website until Monday afternoon. But the listing suddenly disappeared after thenation.com reported that . scores of the frightening semi-automatic weapon were being sold through . the retail giant's site. Thenation.com said the model was available at 1,700 Walmart stores across the country. It's not clear how Lanza's gun . enthusiast mother, Nancy, got her hands on the Bushmaster rifle, a . civilian version of an assault rifle used by troops fighting in the Iraq . and Afghanistan.","Movie studio Paramount moving swiftly to review its promotional materials .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Donald Trump's dislike for Barack Obama has become so strong that he'd rather praise Saddam Hussein than his country's own president. The real estate mogul and perpetual potential presidential candidate explained to the crowd at a New Hampshire breakfast frequented by White House wannabes that Iraq has become 'the Harvard of terrorism.' 'Whether you liked Saddam or not,' Trump said Tuesday at St. Anselm College's Politics & Eggs, 'he used to kill terrorists.' Scroll down for video . Whoa, did I just say that? Donald Trump took the opportunity of addressing the Politics & Eggs forum at New Hampshire's St. Anselm College to criticize Barack Obama by complimenting Saddam Hussein . The outspoken billionaire seemed to clamor for controversy at the event, where he told attendees leading up to a Q&A to make sure their questions were 'really salacious.' 'It is my real hair,' he joked to the Bedford, New Hampshire crowd. Trump claimed during Tuesday's that he may seek the Republican presidential nomination for 2016, saying he wants to undo President Barack Obama's legacy. 'You know why? I'm unhappy with the way things are going in America,' the avid Obama critic said in a telephone interview ahead of the speech. The 67-year-old also took aim at . potential 2016 contender Chris Christie, according to LA Times . Washington bureau reporter Mike Memoli. 'It's a very scary situation for Chris,' Trump said. 'It's going to go on for a long time.' He . referred, of course, to the New Jersey governor's current Bridgegate . scandal, which had escalated in recent days with new accusations of high . level misdeeds in his administration. 'He’s one email away from a disaster,' Trump said. 'Whether you liked Saddam or not, he used to kill terrorists,' said Trump. He said Iraq is now 'the Harvard of terrorism' Tricky: The 67-year-old used the forum, which is often visited by potential presidential candidates, to discuss Chris Christie's current scandal and highlight his own foreign policy chops . Trump also showed off his foreign policy chops. 'Mexico is eating our lunch,' he said. And later: 'Every time I hit a country, I get a call from the prime minister...or sometimes it’s a dictator.' Trump, who made a fortune building skyscrapers and running casinos and hosts U.S. reality TV show Celebrity Apprentice, has long been a vocal critic of Obama and made waves after demanding proof the president was born in the United States. The White House released the long-form copy of Obama's birth certificate in 2011 showing that Obama was born in Hawaii. 'He's one email away from a disaster,' Trump said of Christie, who's administration is embroiled in a high-level political controversy . Trump said that he believed the launch of the Affordable Care Act - Obama's signature domestic policy achievement popularly known as Obamacare - was an ""abysmal"" failure and that Obama had not done enough to shore up the economy during his term. 'No one has any idea what's happening at the top. America is not headed in the right direction, and that worries me,' he said. 'I want to talk about what needs to be done.' Trump has also hinted he could run for governor of New York in 2014, claiming he has a $200 million war chest available for a campaign if he chooses to challenge Democratic incumbent Andrew Cuomo. 'Every time I hit a country, I get a call from the prime minister...or sometimes it's a dictator,' said Trump perplexingly, after claiming that 'Mexico is eating our lunch'","Trump told a packed house at the Politics & Eggs breakfast at St. Anselm College that Obama has helped Iraq become the 'Harvard of terrorism'

The certificate will allow non-religious marriages and civil ceremonies to be performed at the studio, where the ITV soap was filmed for 53 years. The licence covers Stage One, home to indoor sets including the Rovers Return pub and the Underworld factory. Coronation's Street's famous cobbled streets have been granted a wedding licence . The area also includes the homes of some of the show’s most famous characters, from Jack and Vera Duckworth’s old house to the Platt family’s residence and Carla Barlow’s flat. The barge where Ken Barlow’s mistress Martha Fraser lived is also moored there. Brides and grooms will be able to have their photos taken on the famous Weatherfield cobbles once they have got hitched inside. The studio opened as a temporary visitor attraction in April after production moved to a new set at MediaCityUK in Salford Quays. Tours of the set are operated by tourist attractions group Continuum, which applied for the wedding licence last month. The venue can already be hired out for private events, which give guests access to the whole set, but it has yet to host a wedding reception. Evening hire is currently only available on weekdays, at a cost of £2,500, with the venue catering for up to 120 people at a sit-down dinner and 250 at a drinks reception. Non-religious marriages and civil ceremonies will now be held at the soap's famous landmarks such as the Rovers Return, pictured . It has already taken a number of corporate bookings and will hold its first bar mitzvah party next week. Wedding packages and prices are still being finalised and details are expected to be announced early next week. Corrie fans who want to tie the knot there will have to make it a shotgun wedding though - the studios are earmarked for redevelopment and are set to close in October.

A necklace made from the claws of a grizzly bear and a Colt .45 six-shooter once owned by ex-scout and showman 'Buffalo Bill' Cody sold at auction in Dallas for more than $40,000 each. Heritage Auctions says both sold Saturday for the same sale price: $40,625. The Dallas-based auction house sold the two pieces during its 'Legends of the West Signature Auction,' which featured nearly 400 collectible items including guns, photos, badges and books.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Whitey Bulger has revealed that he relishes his years spent on the run and says that those memories are the ones helping him through his latest prison sentence. The notorious Boston gangster was sentenced to spend life in prison plus up to 30 years after being found guilty on racketeering and extortion counts from his days as the head of the Winter Hill Gang. Now he is using that time in jail to formulate his own narrative, writing a letter from his prison cell where he tells how he wishes things were different for himself- and for his longtime girlfriend, Catherine Greig. Better days: Whitey Bulger wrote in a recent letter from prison that the 16 years he spent on the run with his girlfriend Catherine Greig were the best of his life (pictured together here in an undated photo) Spotted: Greig and Bulger were captured in 2011 in their then-apartment in Santa Monica, California . 'My 16 years on the run were the happiest years of my life and hers. Memories sustain me,' he wrote in the letter. Captive man: Whitey Bulger, 83, was sentenced to life in prison with up to 30 additional years behind bars . 'If I met Catherine at a younger age I would have had a better life. She was the best thing that ever happened to me.' Greig began dating Bulger sometime in the 1970s and lived together in Boston before they went on the run in 1995. After being caught by authorities by Bulger's side in their adopted apartment in Santa Monica, California in 2011, she was recently tried and found guilty of harboring a fugitive. She is now serving an eight-year prison sentence. Bulger does not appear to be settling for his life sentence, as he writes that he is 'getting things together for appeal'. 'Jail and prisons are a dead end,' he said in the letter obtained by Radar.com. It is unclear who the intended recipient was meant to be. 'I expect the worst is yet to come — I’ll deal with it and welcome the ""peace,""' the 83-year-old convict wrote. 'Will be busy but will write you again later on — You could do me a favor. Stay out of trouble and avoid entanglement in this. Meet a nice girl and enjoy life + appreciate freedom.' In another jailhouse letter, Bulger wrote how he finds Greig has been inappropriately sentenced, as her eight years is a larger sentence than many of the fellow mobsters who testified against him in trial. Writing that ‘her sentence is a crime,’ Mr Bulger said, signing the letter 'Inmate No. 1428AZ,' the same prisoner number he was issued during his early 1960s stay at Alcatraz. Traveling man: Bulger, seen here in an undated photo that was shown at his trial, was on the run from about 1995 to 2011 but now he will spend the rest of his life behind bars . Earlier days: In his latest letter, Bulger said that the years on the run- and not the ones when he was working his way up to be Boston's biggest mob boss- were his favorite . ‘More time + fine than people who confessed to murder and made deal to testify against me for the gov and in return set free after short sentence. They told the gov what it wanted to hear and were rewarded.' Of the former Winter Hill gang henchmen Mr Bulger is referring to, one is likely Stephen ‘The Rifleman’ Flemmi – a confessed murderer who pulled his victims’ teeth out to prevent identification, had a sexual relationship with his stepdaughter and lured her to a home where Mr Bulger allegedly strangled her to death, according to his testimony during Bulger’s long-awaited trial.

"By . Ted Thornhill . Updated: . 06:47 EST, 12 December 2011 . A greater percentage of Mars is habitable than Earth, say scientists who have made an overall study of temperature and pressure conditions of the Red Planet. Researchers from the Australian National University say that three per cent of Mars could sustain life, while just one per cent of Earth’s volume contains life – from the core to upper atmosphere. However, the team say that most Earth-like organisms would need to retreat underground to survive on Mars. Water find: Thanks to huge amounts of ice and warmer conditions underground, life could thrive on Mars . Astrobiologist Charley Lineweaver told AFP: ‘What we tried to do, simply, was take almost all of the information we could and put it together and say “is the big picture consistent with there being life on Mars?”’ And the simple answer is yes... There are large regions of Mars that are compatible with terrestrial life.’ Life could exist on Mars, scientists say, largely because there is a huge amount of water there in the form of ice, found at the polar regions. But the pressure on the planet is so low that water would vaporise on the surface. Below ground, however, there is sufficient pressure for water to be kept in a liquid state, which would enable microbes to thrive. On average it lies 141.6 million miles from the Sun. With a diameter of 4,222 miles, it’s around half the size of the Earth. It’s absolutely freezing there, with an average temperature of -85F (-65C). Gravity is much less powerful - slightly less than 40 per cent of ours. The atmosphere is desperately thin – one per cent of Earth’s pressure – and not very nice for us humans because 95 per cent of it is carbon dioxide. It boasts the solar system’s biggest mountain – Olympus Mons, a dead volcano with staggering proportions. It measures 335 miles across and rises to a height of 88,000ft, which is almost three times higher than Everest. Mars has two cosmic sidekicks – the moons Deimos and Phobos. Mars’s red colouring comes from the iron oxide that coats its surface. Mars has huge amounts of ice at its polar caps. If they melted, it would cover the whole planet in water 11-metres deep, according to Nasa. And while the surface temperature is not ideal for life, being an extremely chilly -65C, below ground it would be much warmer thanks to heat from the planet’s core. Lineweaver added that his study, which analysed decades of data, was ‘the best estimate yet published of how habitable Mars is to terrestrial microbes’. Lineweaver's findings were published today in Astrobiology. Scientists will learn a great deal more about Mars’s ability to sustain life when the rover Curiosity lands on the surface next August. Nasa’s earlier Viking rovers concluded 35 years ago that there was no sign of life, but scientists hope Curiosity’s more sophisticated equipment will reveal more. It will be 'the largest and most complex piece of equipment ever placed on the surface of another planet', said Doug McCuistion, director of Nasa’s Mars exploration programme. The rover is expected to land on Mars on August 5, 2012, after travelling nearly 354million miles from our planet. One of the chief tasks of the $2.5billion mission will be to discover the source of the methane gas scientists have detected in the Martian air. It will also fire a laser beam with the energy of a million lightbulbs at the surface of the red planet to see whether or not it could have supported life. The international team of space explorers that launched the Mars Science Laboratory is relying on the instrument to look for biological signs on the distant world. The ChemCam will fire a powerful laser pulse, vaporising some Mars dust and examining the spectrum of light shining through it. The robust system is one of 10 instruments mounted on the mission's rover vehicle. Analysis: The ChemCam system uses a laser to take samples from as far as 23 feet away from the Curiosity rover . Exploring: Opportunity is about to spend its fifth winter on Mars . When ChemCam fires its extremely powerful laser pulse, it will vaporise an area the size of a pinhead. The system's telescope will peer at the flash of glowing plasma created by the vaporized material and record the colours of light contained within it. These spectral colours will then be interpreted by a spectrometer, enabling scientists to determine the elemental composition of the vaporised material. Hardy: Opportunity has covered an impressive 21 miles on the Martian surface . Meanwhile, Nasa's lone surviving Mars rover Opportunity is scouting the landscape in search of a place to spend its fifth winter. The . solar-powered robot geologist has been scouting out sites along the . crater rim that not only have interesting rocks to examine but also . ample sunshine. The hardy rover has survived four previous Martian . winters and scientists expect no different and even drew up a to-do . list. Opportunity will ‘keep active all winter long’, said Bruce Banerdt, rover project scientist at Nasa headquarters. The probe has so far covered around 21 miles of the Martian surface.","Three per cent of Mars's volume could sustain life, compared to one per cent on Earth ."
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . From the East End to the Dales, our favourite soaps are supposed to reflect the people who live there. But actually, if the characters of EastEnders, Emmerdale, Coronation Street or Hollyoaks had to pay real-life prices for the homes they live in they would be homeless, according to statistics revealed yesterday. The National Housing Federation came to its conclusion after comparing property prices in East London, Salford, the Yorkshire Dales and Chester to the characters’ average salaries as listed by the ONS. Fantasy land: The cast of Eastenders appear to live happily on their modest salaries and pay the mortgage . A spokesman said the characters’ modest wages wouldn’t even cover the cost of rent, never mind a mortgage. Ruth Davison of the National Housing Federation said: ‘Without more affordable homes across the country, people on modest incomes will continue to face the real-life drama of being unable to put down roots.’ The figures were revealed in the wake of Chancellor George Osborne announcing he wants the Bank of England to ‘intervene’ to cap mortgages handed out to homebuyers to avoid a property bubble. As far as residents of EastEnders are concerned the average house price in the ‘East End’ is £355,000, according to the NHF. In Fassett Square - the square in Hackney which was the model for EastEnders’ Albert Square - a three-bed home with two bathrooms is worth around £1m and the average price for a house in the square is £662,565. Real life: Prices in Hackney, east London, are soaring with houses on the model for Albert Square worth £1m . Whether in the East End or Fassett Sqaure, most of the characters in the BBC soap wouldn’t have a hope of buying a house in the area - or even renting, as average rents are around £1,250 a month. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), a marker trader like Alfie Moon or Bianca Butcher would earn around £20,500 a year. Most mortgage lenders offer house buyers four times their salary, meaning Alfie and Bianca could only afford a home worth £82,000, and would struggle to pay rent of £1,264 a month. Car lot boss Max Branning, likely to pull in around £26,000, and laundry manager Dot Cotton - on around £16,000 - would also struggle to afford to buy in the East End. The same goes for most of the cast, including restaurant boss Ian Beale - on around £40,000 - with the only one who could possibly afford to buy a house in the area being grease monkey and businessman Phil Mitchell with his dodgy deals.","National Housing Federation compared characters' salaries to home costs .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . and David Jones . Letting out a mighty roar after scoring a goal, this was Britain’s blue-haired wheelchair rugby player David Anthony in action last night. A capacity crowd of 10,000 cheered on Anthony and the rest of the team as they took on reigning champions United States in the fast and furious sport once known as ‘murderball’. The crowd ensured an electric atmosphere for the eagerly awaited tournament launch of a sport that can feature ferocious clashes between players.

No holds barred: Will Groulx of the USA is up-ended during the wheelchair rugby match against Great Britain at the Basketball Arena . Violent collisions saw players go . flying, prompting the commentator to shout: ‘What a hit!’ Regular stops . in play allowed a team of helpers to sprint from the touchline and right . upended chairs, caused by tough tackles. The huge hits, met with gasps . and groans from the crowd, could be heard high up in the packed stadium, . and left stricken players prone on the floor. There were also regular . pauses for chairs to undergo a mid-court ‘pit stop’ as damaged wheels . were replaced. The GB team put on a brave display but . eventually lost 56-44 in their pool match.

France are next up tonight, followed by Japan tomorrow, with successive . victories certain to secure semi-final status. Brown said: ‘The States are number one . in the world, so it was never going to be easy. 'We had the bounce of . the ball sometimes, and other times it went against us.

I . am not thinking about the history.' He added that it was a 'buzz' to play in front of sell-out crowds. After today's opener, Britain play . France tomorrow evening, then Japan on Friday. Both semi-finals are on . Saturday, with the final one of the Games' last events next Sunday . afternoon. The game was invented in the 1970s by athletes with quadriplegia wanting an alternative sport to wheelchair basketball, but it was not until 1989 that the first international tournament was held. Great Britain was among the three teams taking part in Toronto, Canada. Can barely watch: The Earl and an aghast Countess of Wessex get into the action at the match .

As if being the only female member of the British wheelchair rugby team was not enough to make Kylie Grimes, above, stand out, she has also had a Union Jack shaved into the side of her bright red hair. The . 24-year-old put in an impressive performance when the ParalympicsGB . team faced the USA, ranked number one in the world, in the opening match . of the competition this afternoon. She is only the second woman to play with the British team at Paralympic level. Grimes, . who lives in Farnham, Surrey, took up the sport two years ago after an . accident which left her paralysed from the chest down. She . lost a £6million damages claim at the High Court last year over the . injury, which happened when she hit her head on the bottom of a swimming . pool as a teenager in 2006. Grimes . knew that she 'wanted to continue playing sport and as soon as she saw . her first game of wheelchair rugby, she says she knew it was the sport . for her', according to the British Paralympic Association. It first appeared at a Paralympic . Games in 1996 as a demonstration sport, making the Sydney . Games the . first time it was given full medal status. Wheelchair rugby is played indoors on a . basketball court, with mixed teams of four players who use a white . ball, similar to a volleyball. To . score a goal, an athlete has to pass the opposing team's goal line . while in firm control of the ball, with two wheels of their chair . crossing the line. The ball has to be passed or dribbled . every 10 seconds and is passed to the other side if that does not . happen. There are four eight-minute quarters to each game. While . there is contact between the chairs, penalties are incurred if physical . contact is made with an opponent or if an opponent's chair is hit . behind the rear wheel. Athletes are classified with a points system, on a scale from 0.5 to 3.5. Their team of four athletes on court . at any one time cannot exceed a total of 8.0 points in total unless . there is a woman in the team, in which case they are allowed an extra . 0.5 points. Those with the . highest level of impairment are classified as 0.5 players and along with . the 1.0 players, can not easily pick up or pass the ball, making them . more suited to being blockers. Those . with a rating of 3.0 or 3.5 have a high degree of strength and . stability as well as higher functionality in their upper limbs. Currently, the sport is dominated by the US and Canadian teams. Melee: ParalympicsGB player is hurled out of his chair after a shuddering collision .

High-flier: Britain's Ross Morrison throws the ball over Seth McBride . Murderball was given its name by the devil-may-care quadriplegics who invented the game during the late Seventies. It was also the title of a 2005 documentary starring U.S. player Mark Zurpan, about teams competing at the previous year’s Paralympics in Athens. The sport - otherwise known as wheelchair rugby - was invented by a group of Canadians who met in rehab and whose disabilities were so severe that they couldn’t participate in wheelchair basketball. Brutal: Murderball was popularised in a 2005 documentary starring U.S. player Mark Zurpan (right) about the sport during the Athens Games a year earlier . Searching for an outlet for their machismo, they found slamming into one another like wheel-propelled warriors exhilaratingly therapeutic. Sparks visibly fly as aluminium wheels are deliberately jammed by nasty devices (called ‘spikes’) attached to the front of some chairs. Attackers attempt to force the ball over the goal-line with the aid of battering rams, with the barging is so ferocious that players are frequently thrown from their seats, sometimes breaking fingers and arms. The sport soon became popular across the border in the U.S., and in the Eighties reached Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Britain. It has rapidly evolved, at the elite level, into a strategic game likened to fast-moving human chess. Though the British HQ is at Twickenham and the aim is to get the ball — round not oval — across a goal-line, it bears little resemblance to rugby.","Home nation outscored world number one in first quarter of pool match .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Magic Johnson is at the center of the racism scandal surrounding the LA Clippers owner but new reports reveal that he may be plotting a bigger role in the eventual ending. The former NBA player is reportedly vying for a chance to own the Clippers himself, and is hoping that the recording that features the team's current owner Donald Sterling making racist comments about African Americans may help Johnson get back in the game. 'Magic's absolutely interested,' a NBA source told Yahoo News. New leadership? Magic Johnson is reportedly interested in buying the LA Clippers amid the racism scandal surrounding the team's coach, Donald Sterling . The retired player is the most famous member of Guggenheim Partners, a financial services firm worth hundreds of billions of dollars, and has worked with them to buy professional sports teams in the past. This wouldn't be the first time that Johnson and Guggenheim Partners bought an area team, as they paid $2.15billion for the LA Dodgers in 2012. More recently, they tried to buy the LA Lakers but the family that owns the team refused a sale. The investment group made another big buy in February, effectively bailing out the area's women's basketball team, the Sparks, when it was about to fold. Analysts have speculated that the move wasn't so much out of equal opportunity goodwill, but really in an effort to get on the good side of the NBA administrators in order to make a future purchase of a men's team more likely. 'This is 100 per cent Magic's plan,' an anonymous league official told Yahoo. Tirade: The recording stemmed from a conversation between Sterling and his girlfriend V. Stiviano (right) after she posted this photo with Magic Johnson to her Instagram account . Not quite a reality: Sterling (left) cannot be forced into a sale by the team or the NBA but Johnson (right) and his investment team have a history of buying local sports franchises . The . fact that Johnson has already been an unintended character in the . racism scandal just makes the hypothetical solution fit even more . nicely. The controversial recording was released over the weekend and is believed to show Sterling condemning his girlfriend V. Stiviano for posting a picture of she and Johnson on her Instagram feed. He goes on in lengthy recording, telling her: 'Don't put him (Johnson) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me.  And don't bring him to my games.' A sale to Johnson and the Guggenheim group is far from a done deal, however, as there is no way that the Clippers organization can oust Sterling, who bought the team for $12million in 1981. Owner's spot: Johnson and his financial partners bought the LA Dodgers baseball team for $2.15billion in 2012 and he is a regular at the games (at the 2014 season opener and at right a week later) The Daily Beast suggests that given the current climate of overpaying for relatively-unknown teams, the current pricetag for the Clippers could be boosted from $575million to $1billion. That leaves any and all action in the hands of the NBA which can really only issue fines and temporary penalties but cannot force him to give up the team. 'If the owners can't force (Sterling) to sell, they need to be held accountable to change the bylaws so they can,' an unidentified member of the NBA's board of governors told Yahoo. 'A fine and suspension is meaningless, and that'll be seen as a lack of acceptance that the league and owners are responsible for this a******.'","Magic Johnson and his investment partners have a history of buying LA-area sports teams but has yet to purchase an NBA franchise .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A driver in Southern California has captured the shocking moment a crazed motorcyclist attacked a van while standing at a red light in the town of Victorville. The road rage incident took place at around 11am Thursday at the intersection of Bear Valley and Mariposa roads. According to Christian Quezada, who recorded the altercation, he became concerned when he saw a biker open the door of a van standing at a light next to him and yell at the unsuspecting driver. Scroll down for videos . Explosive temper: An enrgaed biker was caught on video kicking a van at a stoplight in Victorville, California . Road rage: The motorcyclist punched the side mirror on the van belonging to a blinds company until it nearly broke off . ‘I saw his face,’ Quezada told NBC Los Angeles. ‘He was really scared ... Poor guy.’ At that moment, Quezada pulled out his cell phone and began recording the confrontation between the two strangers. The footage shows the enraged motorcyclist repeatedly kicking the door of the van on the driver's side and punching the side mirror until it is left dangling by a thread. At one point, the attacker appears to return to his bike, but he then quickly walks up to the van again for one last hard kick. According to Quezada, he also noticed that the biker flashed what appeared to be gang signs at the driver of the van, which made him fearful for his own safety. Scared for his life: The man who recorded the incident said the driver of the van appeared terrified during the attack . Signs of trouble: The biker flashed what appeared to be gang signs at the victim . The motorcyclist eventually hopped back on his vehicle and took off. A moment earlier, Quezada said the man pointed to his right leg as if to say that the van had clipped him. When the light at the intersection turned green, the bike drove away. The van in the video belongs to a Corona-based company called Century Blinds. A manager there told CBS Los Angeles the driver has worked for Century Blinds for 16 years, and he had no clue why the biker was so furious at him. 'Payback': Before taking off, the man gestured to his right leg, possibly indicating that the van had clipped him earlier . Officials at the San Bernardino Sheriff's Office have reviewed Quezada's road rage recording and would like to interview the mystery biker. Locating the man may prove challenging, however, since the red motorcycle did not have a rear license plate, and its owner was wearing a wraparound black helmet and gloves. In the video, the man is seen sporting a black-and-orange jacket with a rucksack trimmed in red on his back.","Incident took place at an intersection in Victorville, California, Thursday morning .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . If you've ever queued for a public toilet at a festival or event, you'll know how difficult it is to find the cleanest option, quickly. With that in mind, a mathematician has devised a system of determining how many toilets must be rejected automatically to guarantee the best possible option. When faced with a row of 100, her conclusion is that the first 37 should be avoided, and then each should be opened in order to make the correct choice. Scroll down for videos . What's the best way to pick a public toilet at a festival or event? According to Dr Ria Symonds. for YouTube channel Numberphile. she claims that out of 100 toilets, people should discard the first 37 and then pick the next best toilet based on the 37 they've already observed, to get the cleanest experience . In the video, Dr Symonds draws three toilets on a piece of paper, and numbers them one to three - one being the most hygienic, and three being the dirtiest. The order of these doors is then randomly mixed up. There are six permutations of this problem, making it three factorial. The chances of the first toilet being clean is slim, especially at large numbers so Dr Symnods suggests rejecting the first toilet in each permutation, and selecting the next best. Using the first permutation, Dr Symonds can't pick the first, but the second isn't as clean as the first, so that leaves the third as her only option. She then continues to go through the system in the other five permutations, and by rejecting the first each time, picks the cleanest toilet on three occasions. This results in a three out of six, or 50 per cent, chance, of picking the best toilet overall. When this number raises to 100, she applies the same principle and discovers that the best way to get the cleanest possible toilet is to reject the first 37. This particular mathematical problem is similar to the ‘secretary problem’. This famous conundrum asks how, out of 100 candidates, an interviewer would pick the best person for a job. The same principle can also be used to select the best toilet at a festival, apparently. ‘If you ever go to a music festival, especially a music festival in the UK, you might come across the problem that there’s always lots of toilets for you to choose from,’ said Dr Ria Symonds from the University of Nottingham in the video for YouTube channel Numberphile. She explains that 'the problem with these toilets is they’re not always that well looked after.’ So, in this particular problem, there can be considered three types of toilet: one that is deemed disgusting, one that is adequate, and one that it spotless. ‘Ideally I’m looking for the best toilet, the most hygienic, the cleanest toilet, one with plenty of toilet paper in there and hand sanitiser and has been looked after,' she said. When searching for the best toilet she imagines a row of many, in this case 100, and in the problem a festival-goer works through the toilets one-by-one. But the second constraint is that you can’t go back to a previous rejected toilet as ‘there are people queieing behind you.' After some painstaking maths, which you can watch in the videos below, Dr Symonds ultimately comes to her conclusion. Glastonbury is famed for its rather unsanitary toilets. Here festival-goers are seen using the newly installed long drop toilets in the rain at the festival at Worthy Farm in Somerset on 26 June 2014. Perhaps with this new mathematical method, though, people won't need to seek these new toilets out . ‘If we were in Glastonbury and there were 100 toilets, what we should do is reject the first 37 toilets that we see,’ explained Dr Symonds. She clarified that you need to look in each of those toilets. After that, you should then pick the next best toilet that you see as compared to the previous 37, which will get you the optimum standard of toilet. This will prevent you from running out of toilets before finding one suitable, but it also makes sure you will find the best available toilet as quickly as possible. And after the 37th toilet, you then also have a 37 per cent chance that a toilet you pick is actually the best category of toilet (lots of toilet paper and soap) in the remaining 67 per cent. This method was also famously suggested to be used in the dating world to find the best partner - although perhaps lining up 100 men or women as prospective partners wouldn't go down so well. If you’re in the mood for more mathematical brain teasers you might also enjoy the famous Monty Hall problem, a paradox named after the host of the American TV game show Let’s Make a Deal. In the problem a contestant is presented with three doors: behind two is a goat and one has a new car - the latter of which they obviously want to win (contestants who would rather win one of the two goats are not considered here). The contestant is then asked to pick one of the three doors but, before they are allowed to open it, the gameshow host (who knows the location of the car) opens one of the other doors, revealing a goat. The contestant is then given the choice to switch. Should they switch, or should they stick with their door? Does it even matter? It’s intuitive to think that it doesn’t matter as, with two doors, there is a 50:50 chance the contestant will pick the car. But a bit of maths shows that switching is actually much more successful. In fact, the car will be chosen 2/3 times if the contestant switches, compared to just 1/3 if they don’t. The reason is explained in the image below. In each it is assumed the contestant chooses door 1 each time, although it doesn’t matter which they actually pick - this is just an example. As can be seen, when they make their initial selection they have just a 1/3 chance of being correct. But after the host has revealed a goat, switching then gives them a 2/3 chance of getting the car.","Nottingham professor reveals how to pick the best toilet at a festival .

She begins by removing Millie's make-up with Nelson's Pure and Clear facial wipes to 'cleanse the canvas' in preparation for the makeover. She moisturises Millie's skin and explains that if you have oily skin, it is essential to use a primer before applying make-up. The foundation of choice is Nars Sheer Glow Barcelona, which she applies with a brush and then blends in with her fingers, explaining that Millie 'loved it' on her skin the last time she used it. Close: The pair are good friends and Millie calls on Tanya to help make her up when she has a big event . 'I use their tinted moisturiser in the day but I think that this is more of an evening look,' says Millie. Tanya then uses a Tom Ford brow definer to sculpt Millie's eyebrows before applying Urban Decay Naked Palette eyeshadow. 'This is the perfect colour for Christmas parties. If you don't like going for a dark smoky eye,' explains Tanya, as she intensifies Millie's eye make-up with Clinique Liner in Intense Brown. To sparkle up Millie's look, Tanya applies MAC's antique gold reflex glitter to her eyelid before sweeping Maybelline Volume Express Mascara over her lashes. 'And now for the really exciting part, we are going to use Millie's new Soho lashes, they are amazing,' says Tanya. Prep: She begins by moisturising Millie's skin before applying the foundation and eye make-up . 'These are perfect for the party look, they give a really sexy feline look,' adds Millie.

"By . Eddie Wrenn . da Vinci or not? The younger Mona Lisa is seen in a vault in Onex near Geneva . Experts appeared confident yesterday when they unveiled a younger version of the Mona Lisa, claiming they could prove the painting was an original da Vinci, portraying perhaps the most-famous smile in humanity in her younger years. The Zurich-based Mona Lisa Foundation unveiled what is known as the 'Isleworth Mona Lisa' to the public, and said mathematical analysis proved it was the hand of the Master at work here. But other experts remain unconvinced, with Oxford professor Martin Kemp telling the BBC there is 'no basis for thinking that there was an earlier portrait'. He said: 'The Isleworth Mona Lisa mistranslates subtle details of the original, . including the sitter’s veil, her hair, the translucent layer of her . dress, the structure of the hands. 'The landscape is devoid of atmospheric subtlety. The head, like all . other copies, does not capture the profound elusiveness of the . original. 'The scientific analysis can at most state that there is nothing to say . that this cannot be by Leonardo. The infrared reflectography and X-ray . points very strongly to its not being by Leonardo.' The Mona Lisa Foundation begs to differ. 'So far, not . one scientific test has been able to disprove that the painting is by . Leonardo,' said art historian Stanley Feldman. 'We have used methods that were not available to Leonardo 500 years ago. 'When we do a very elementary mathematical test, we have discovered that all of the elements of the two bodies - the two people, the two sitters - are in exactly the same place. It strikes us that in order for that to be so accurate, so meticulously exact, only the person who did one did the other ... It's an extraordinary revelation in itself, and we think it's valid.' Scroll down for video . Is it me you're looking for? The painting on the left is arguably the most recognisable in the world - but is the image on the right real or fake? Secret smile: The latest researchers suggest that da Vinci's handiwork is on display in both paintings . The Isleworth painting - likewise a portrait of a young woman with an enigmatic smile - is slightly larger, was painted on canvas and has brighter colors than the famed Louvre Museum masterpiece painted on wood. The posture, folded hand positions, faces, expressions and clothing are similar, while the landscape in the background is different. The foundation says the painting turned up in the home of an English nobleman in the late 1800s - thus the connection to Isleworth - and was shipped to the United States for safekeeping during World War I. After the war, it was analysed in Italy, and eventually taken to Switzerland where it remained in a bank vault for the last 40 years, the group said. The Isleworth Mona Lisa has been known publicly for generations - if forgotten by the broader public - and the book excerpts numerous news headlines about the painting and the possibility of its Da Vinci connection in the early 20th century. hat do you think? The Mona Lisa Foundation, a non-profit organisation based in Zurich, offer 'historical, comparative and scientific evidence' to back their claims . World famous: The painting by Leonardo da Vinci, pictured, has been imitated a thousand times, satirised, stolen and vandalised with acid, red paint, stones and even a teacup . Admiration: Art fans look at the Mona Lisa painting by Leonardo da Vinci, left, in the Louvre museum in Paris . The Gioconda is an alternative title . for the Mona Lisa; Mona is an abbreviation of ‘Ma donna’, or My Lady, . while Gioconda is Italian for the jocund, or happy, one. The sitter’s real name is in fact thought to be Lisa Gherardini, wife of a rich Florence silk merchant, Francesco del Giocondo. On . Leonardo’s death in 1519, the picture — the Louvre’s version, that is — . was left to his assistant, Salai, who in turn sold it to King Francis I . of France. The painting remained in the royal  collection until the French Revolution in 1789, when it was moved to the Louvre. There it has remained ever since, with . a few notable absences. Napoleon kept it in his bedroom in the . Tuileries Palace and, during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1, it was . transferred for safekeeping to the Arsenal in Brest. During . World War II, it migrated all over France to avoid damage. It has also . been on tour to New York and Washington, Tokyo and Moscow. But . the picture’s biggest excursion was in 1911, when it was stolen by an . Italian Louvre worker, called Vincenzo Peruggia, who wanted it returned . to Italy. He pulled off . the biggest art theft in history in the simplest way: hiding in a broom . cupboard during the day, then slipping out after closing time, the Mona . Lisa stuffed under his coat. He . kept it in his flat for two years and was only discovered when he . brazenly tried to flog the picture to the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. That wasn’t the end of Mona Lisa’s . troubles. In 1956, the poor old girl was first scarred with acid, and . then attacked with a rock. Bulletproof . glass protected it when, in 1974, a disabled woman, protesting against . the Louvre’s policy on handicapped visitors, threw red paint at the . picture. The glass again . saved the picture only three years ago, when an angry Russian woman, . denied French  citizenship, threw a teacup at the painting. Meanwhile, . the other supposed Mona Lisa gathered dust in a Swiss bank vault, where . it has rested for 40 years. After Pulitzer’s death, he left the picture . to his girlfriend and, on her death, the Swiss consortium bought it.","Swiss consortium argue their version is his first stab at the painting .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Vast glaciers in West Antarctica seem to . be locked in an irreversible thaw linked to global warming that may . push up sea levels for centuries, according to scientists. In a few hundred years they say the irreversible melt that has already started could eventually add four to 12 feet (1.2 to 3.7 metres) to current sea levels. A Nasa study looking at 40 years of ground, airplane and satellite data of what researchers call 'the weak underbelly of West Antarctica' shows the melt is happening faster than scientists had predicted, crossing a critical threshold that has begun a domino-like process. Scroll down for video . Two new studies indicate that part of the huge West Antarctic ice sheet is starting a slow collapse in an unstoppable way. Six glaciers, eaten away from below by a warming of sea waters around the frozen continent, were flowing fast into the Amundsen Sea, according to the report based on data from 1992 to 2011 . Evidence . shows 'a large sector of the West Antarctic ice sheet has gone into a . state of irreversible retreat', says lead author Eric Rignot of the . University of California, Irvine, and Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory . in Pasadena, California. The . coastal ends of the glaciers rest on bedrock below sea level, holding . back a vast weight of ice and making them vulnerable to melt, he said. 'It does seem to be happening quickly,' says University of Washington glaciologist Ian Joughin, lead author of a separate study into the same phenomenon. 'We really are witnessing the beginning stages.' It's likely because of man-made global warming and the ozone hole which have changed the Antarctic winds and warmed the water that eats away at the feet of the ice, researchers said at a Nasa news conference Monday. 'The system is in sort of a chain reaction that is unstoppable,' continued Rignot. 'Every process in this reaction is feeding the next one. It's passed the point of no return.' Rignot and other scientists said the . 'grounding line' which could be considered a dam that stops glacier . retreat has essentially been breached. Another way to think of it is like wine flowing from a . horizontal uncorked bottle, they said. The only thing that could stop . the retreat in this low-altitude region is a mountain or hill. But ice-penetrating . radars showed there are no mountain ranges entombed under the ice that could halt the flow. Despite ice coverage increasing in some areas, Nasa claims that in a few hundred years the irreversible melt that has already started from the Amundsen Sea sector of the West Antarctica ice sheet, pictured, has now 'passed the point of no return' and could eventually add four to 12 feet (1.2 to 3.7 metres) to current sea levels . Scientists say curbing carbon emissions won't be able to stop the collapse of these glaciers, but may slow the process and at least prevent the them from melting at their current speed . This part of Antarctica would be a . major contributor to sea level rise in coming decades and centuries . since the glaciers hold enough ice to raise sea levels by more than four feet (1.2 metres). The fastest retreat from 1992 to 2011 was 21 to 23 miles (34 to 37 kilometres) over the period in the Smith/Kohler glacier. Reducing carbon emissions from fossil fuels to . slow climate change could slow . the speed of the problem, Rignot said, although it will probably not completely halt the melting. Cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, part of efforts to rein in global . warming, could at least slow the slide of the Pine Island, Thwaites, . Haynes, Pope, Smith and Kohler glaciers. 'We . do think this is related to climate warming,' Rignot added. The . scientists believed that a build-up of man-made greenhouse gases in the . atmosphere was affecting wind patterns around Antarctica, driving warmer . waters towards the continent. Almost . 200 nations have agreed to work out a UN pact by the end of 2015 to . combat global warming, which the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate . Change (IPCC) says will cause more floods, droughts, heat waves and . higher seas. Although the Amundsen Sea region (shown shrinking over the last decade) is only a fraction of the whole West Antarctic Ice Sheet, the region contains enough ice to raise global sea levels by four feet (1.2 meters) Rignot looked at six glaciers in the region with special concentration on the Thwaites glacier, about the size of New Mexico and Arizona combined. Thwaites is so connected to the other glaciers that it helps trigger loss elsewhere, said Joughin, whose study was released in the journal Science. Joughin's study used computer simulations and he concluded 'the early-stage collapse has begun.' Rignot, who used data that showed a speed up of melt since the 1990s, said the word 'collapse' may imply too fast a loss - it would be more the start of a slow-motion collapse and 'we can't stop it.' A separate study of the Thwaites . glacier by the University of Washington in the journal Science also said . it may have begun an unstoppable collapse that could last from 200 to . 1,000 years. A disappearance . of the Thwaites alone would raise world sea levels by 1.96 feet (60 centimetres) but the 'glacier also acts as a linchpin on the rest of the ice sheet, . which contains enough ice to cause another three to four metres (10 to 13 feet) of sea . level rise,' it said. Scientists say the early stages of collapse have already begun and there's nothing we can do to stop it. On the left here can be seen the elevation of the region, while on the right the various glaciers that will be affected by the melting of the Amundsen Sea region . Several outside experts in Antarctica added their concern. 'It's bad news. It's a game changer,' said Ted Scambos, lead scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center. 'We thought we had a while to wait and see. We've started down a process that we always said was the biggest worry and biggest risk from West Antarctica.' The Rignot study sees eventually 4 feet (1.2 metres) of sea level rise from the melt. But it could trigger neighboring ice sheet loss that could mean a total of 10 to 12 feet (3.0 to 3.7 metres) of sea level rise, Joughin's study showed. The findings may also mean that . scenarios by the IPCC for sea level rise are too low. The IPCC said last . year that sea levels are likely to rise by between 10 and . 32 inches (26 and 82 centimetres) by the late 21st century, after a rise of just seven inches (19 centimetres) since . 1900. 'The major ice sheets . of this planet will have a larger and larger role in sea level rise in . the decades ahead,' said Sridhar Anandakrishnan, professor of . geosciences at Pennsylvania State University, who was not involved in . the study. Last week, . another study also suggested a part of the far bigger ice sheet in East . Antarctica may also be more vulnerable than expected to thaw. The IPCC . says it is at least 95 percent probable that warming is caused by human . activities, led by the burning of fossil fuels. Meanwhile, on . May 6, the Obama administration issued a study saying that warming 'once considered an issue for a distant future has moved firmly into the . present.' And the IPCC said in March there were signs of irreversible changes to tropical coral reefs and to the Arctic.","New studies say the melting of the West Antarctic ice sheet is unstoppable .

"By . Dan Bloom . These cramped flats expose the extreme lengths Londoners will go to for a room of one's own. All of the boltholes were advertised in the last fortnight in the capital, which is caught in the centre of an explosion in the housing market - with some of the studios pictured costing more than £1,000 a month. Last week a London council banned a landlord from letting out a studio flat so small that its bed blocked a kitchen cupboard, despite a tenant agreeing to rent it for £737 a month in less than 16 hours. Room with a stew: There was an outcry after this flat - so small the bed blocks a kitchen cupboard - was let for £737 a month. But it is not the only 'shoebox' in London . Fancy breakfast in bed? The tenant of this flat in Hammersmith, west London, would only have to take two steps to the hob - for the princely sum of £563 a month . Cosy: This flat is £542 a month in Kilburn, north west London. New build British homes are the smallest in western Europe, the Royal Institute of British Architects says . Council officers investigated after the listing in Islington, north London, was plastered over social media and attracted the attention of the press, and found it could not be rented in its current state. Cllr James Murray, the council's executive member for housing, said: 'This place is a shoebox, not a flat, so we're serving a prohibition order to stop it being rented out again.' But the flat was not the only one with an ultra-quick route to breakfast in bed. Thousands of studio flats are advertised in the capital, many of them costing more than entire homes in the north of England. Often grand Victorian or Edwardian townhouses are split into several shoebox dwellings on each floor, each with a tiny kitchen and shower. The huge furore on social media over the Islington flat has not put off potential landlords. Since then, another studio has come on the market a few streets away for £1,083 per month. It boasts a sleek, modern design - but the kitchen sink is also reachable from the end of the bed. Sleek: This north London flat's modern design will make it far more appealing, but it comes at a cost - £1,083 per month - and the kitchen is still shaped around the bed . Convenient: The shower of this £542-a-month flat in Hammersmith, west London, is inside the bedroom, though the toilet (shared with one other person) is mercifully not . Snug: This flat costs £780 a month in the exclusive west London enclave of Chelsea. Location is everything, as it has two hobs and the kitchen and bed almost touch . Elsewhere a flat is advertised for £780 a month in the exclusive west London enclave of Chelsea - but its occupant shouldn't have too exclusive a taste in cooking, as it has two electric hobs squeezed onto a kitchen counter which ends about 1ft from the bed. One of the biggest problems is storage space. One flat in Harringey, north London, solves that by having its occupant climb a ladder to reach their mattress. But its price - at £607 a month, comparatively low for the capital - is still more than an average three-bedroom flat in Liverpool. Britain now has the smallest new flats in western Europe, according to the Royal Institute of British Architects. It launched a campaign last year calling for an end to 'rabbit hutch Britain' and saying the average new one-bedroom flat is now smaller than a Tube carriage. But as a carriage on the Jubilee line is a princely 495 square feet, most of those pictured in this article are likely to be far smaller than that. And that size is still 100 square feet larger than the minimum size of a one-bed flat recommended by the Greater London Authority. Grand Designs presenter Kevin McCloud fronted the campaign, saying: 'This isn't rocket science. We all instinctively respond to the opportunity for a view, a connection with the outdoors, fresh air, light and space. 'A return to minimum space standards is crucial for the health and wellbeing of the people who will be living in new build homes.' Lofty: Numbering at least six steps - or one giant leap - the occupant of this £607-a-month flat in Harringey, north London, would face a long walk to the fridge . Space: A £628-a-month studio in Shepherd's Bush, west London. House prices in the capital are now almost 25 per cent more than in their pre-recession peak . This flat in Paddington, west London, will set you back an eye-watering £1,257 a month - despite being just big enough to sleep, eat and cook with few feet to spare . But Mr McCloud's comments, almost a year ago, came before yet another surge in London house prices. Last week it was revealed homes in the capital are selling for almost 25 per cent more than in their peak before the recession - and more than double the average in the rest of the country. The Office for National Statistics said a . typical home in the capital is worth £459,000, 24.8 per cent more than . in January 2008. 'London’s renters are . getting a raw deal with flats that are costly, cramped and . claustrophobic' - Roger Harding, Shelter . It is not only flats that are up for grabs. In April a ramshackle building next to an industrial estate in south London, whose most prominent use was to park the Mayor of Southwark's car, sold at auction for £550,000 after a bidding war - three times its estimate. Parking spaces have also boomed in price, with a single space offered in a car park under the Royal Albert Hall in Kensington, west London, for £400,000. The huge increases have sparked fears of a bubble limited entirely to the capital. Prices across the rest of the UK are . still 2.4 per cent lower than they were before the financial crisis, at £195,000. Roger Harding, campaigns director for the homeless charity Shelter, . told MailOnline: 'This is further proof that London’s renters are . getting a raw deal with flats that are costly, cramped and . claustrophobic. 'The . huge cost of private rents in the capital and tough competition for . homes means that many renters have no choice but to take the first place . they can afford, whether they are in poor condition or far too small . for them and their families. 'The . Mayor needs to get serious about building the affordable homes we . desperately need, or times will keep getting tougher for generation . rent.'","There was an outcry after a flat was let for £737 a month - despite the bed blocking one of the kitchen cupboards .

"By . Chloe Lambert . We are often warned that supplements can be dangerous when mixed with medication. But now research is starting to show that the right combinations can be helpful in fighting illness. Co-enzyme Q10, or CoQ10, for example, is now often recommended by doctors to patients on statins. Statins help to lower cholesterol and protect against heart attacks, but they can also cause muscle pain. CoQ10 seems to reduce this side effect, says GP Mike Dixon, chairman of the College of Medicine. ‘I don’t suggest Q10 straight away, but if the patient is getting side effects I do suggest it before changing the statin,’ he says. x . Q10 has also been found to help some breast cancer patients taking Herceptin. Here experts reveal the other supplements that may complement common medications. But remember, if you’re considering starting any supplement, always talk to your doctor first. DEPRESSION . The medication: Antidepressants . The supplement: B vitamins . Why: ‘I sometimes prescribe a Vitamin B compound with antidepressants as it can act as a pick-me-up,’ says Dr Mike Dixon. A study published in 2010 in the journal Psychiatry reported on two cases of patients with depression who had not responded to conventional antidepressants; both were found to have low levels of Vitamin B12 and improved when started on supplements. Meanwhile, 50-100mg of Vitamin B6 has an ‘amplifying’ effect on dementia drugs, says George Lewith, professor of health research at the University of Southampton. Try this: Higher Nature True Food B Complex, £19.90 for 90 capsules, highernature.co.uk. Write caption here . DIABETES . The medication: Metformin . The supplement: Fish oils, B12 . Why: A risk factor for type 2 diabetes is fatty liver disease, where excess . calories lead to the laying down of fat around the organ. Function is . affected and the liver starts producing too much insulin, which can lead . to diabetes. Research at Southampton University has shown taking . about 2g fish oils a day can reduce such fat by 30 per cent. Therefore, . patients taking metformin for type 2 diabetes might well consider adding . this to their daily intake, says Prof Lewith. Some studies have also . found that metformin interferes with the body’s absorption of Vitamin . B12, putting patients at risk of deficiency. ‘Low Vitamin B12 can lead . to anaemia,’ says Prof Lewith. ‘If you’re taking metformin, taking B12 . wouldn’t be an unreasonable thing to do.’ However, other research has . disputed this so ask your own physician first. Try this: VeryWise Omega 3, £9.45  for 150ml,  verywisenutrition.co.uk . CONTRACEPTION . The medication: The pill . The supplement: Vitamin C . Why: Some studies suggest that women taking the contraceptive pill have lower levels of Vitamin C because the hormones it contains may reduce our absorption. Vitamin C is important for immunity and healing. ‘It’s not something everyone on the Pill should be doing, but I do suggest Vitamin C supplements to some patients, particularly if they are having breakthrough bleeding,’  says Dr Dixon. ‘My theory is that Vitamin C increases oestrogen levels and stops breakthrough bleeding, but it’s not been  proven yet.’ Try this: NHP Vitamin C Support, £15.77 for 60 capsules, naturalhealthpractice.com; Solgar Vitamin C, £8.76 for 100 capsules, nutricentre.com .

Why:  People who are on antibiotics may benefit from taking probiotics at the same time, a review of evidence by the respected Cochrane Collaboration found last year. The team said the supplements could prevent the common side effect of diarrhoea by replenishing levels of ‘good’ bacteria in the gut. They also found people taking probiotics had less diarrhoea, nausea  and stomach cramps than those taking  a placebo.

The supplement: Vitamin D  and calcium . Why: Vitamin D and calcium are important for healthy bones, and these supplements are prescribed when someone is diagnosed with osteoporosis, or brittle bones. A review of 137 studies, published in 2011 in the Annals of Internal Medicine, found combined supplementation with Vitamin D and calcium reduces a person’s risk of fracture. However, advice on lifestyle changes and diet must be incorporated too, says Dr Dixon. ‘People need to get outside in the fresh air as sunshine and exercise are so important for strong bones.’ Try this: BetterYou DLux 1000iu, £6.95; Source of Life Garden Vitamin D3, £13.10, both from nutricentre.com .

"By . Paul Bentley . A murderer has been told in prison that he is to become Britain’s youngest grandfather at the age of 27.

Now the girl – who is 13 – has announced to friends on Facebook that she is pregnant by a boy of her own age. Young mother: A 13-year-old girl has become pregnant, which will make her 27-year-old father, in jail for murder, Britain's youngest grandfather (file picture) Last night, the family told of their . despair at the situation. ‘She has only ever seen her dad in prison,’ one aunt told the Mail. ‘She . had no chance. Her dad was furious when he heard she is pregnant but he . did the same so what could he say?’ The murderer’s mother, who will . become a great-grandmother at 47, is being consoled by friends at her . home in the South West. The . girl’s 28-year-old mother has promised to take responsibility for the . baby. The jailed murderer cannot be named because to do so would . identify his daughter, who is a minor. He . was imprisoned for 11 years for murdering a man who tried to intervene . in a robbery. He was due for release last year but his sentence has been . extended until next year because he tried to escape from jail. He . apparently begged his daughter not to go through with the pregnancy, . but she has since posted messages online about the baby. She uploaded a . hospital scan to Facebook, saying she was five months’ pregnant. Social media message: The 13-year-old girl posted pictures of her scans on Facebook when she was five months' pregnant, it was reported . Friends . said they were ‘proud’ of her for keeping the child, with one adding: . ‘Hurry up and push that baby out. You and ******* are going to be the . best mum and dad.’ The girl . has been taken out of school and is now being taught at a special unit . for pregnant teens. She still lives with her mother, who has a new . partner and two young boys. Last night, the girl’s mother and maternal grandmother declined to comment. However, . another family member said of the murderer and his daughter: ‘His . cousins would take her to prison to see him. He would ask if she was . doing her homework. ‘He’d say: “You better had been.” But he’s a kid himself, he does not know what parenting is about.’ The . title of Britain’s youngest grandfather is currently held by Shem .

"One-year-old Benjamin Williams does not look forward to a bottle of milk before bed, he can't even have a cuddle with his doting parents before drifting off to sleep. The toddler has to avoid drinking water, is not allowed to eat chocolate and is unable to have important childhood injections and medication. Benjamin is so allergic to the world around him, he can only eat five foods and the list of things to avoid is ever growing. He can eat so few foods his first birthday cake was a melon with a single candle sticking out of it. One-year-old Benjamine Williams is allergic to the world around him, he cannot drink milk or water, he is not allowed to eat a raft of different foods and even cuddling his parents Kileigh and Glyn can cause his sensitive skin to come out in painful hives . For his first birthday, Benjamin had to enjoy a melon with a candle sticking in the top. His mother Kileigh has gradually, through trial and error, compiled a list of around 40 things her son is allergic to . His parents Kileigh, 27, and Glyn, 37, have compiled the long list of things that cause their son to suffer a dangerous allergic reaction if he so much as touches them. So far it includes bottled water, chocolate, dairy products and corn, but the couple say they are discovering new allergies all the time. Their outgoing son is also allergic to ointments and childhood injections. And his skin is so sensitive, simply cuddling his mother and father can bring him out in painful hives. Doctors feared the toddler, from Newton Abbot in Devon, could be suffering from cerebral palsy and warned his parents he may never walk or talk. But as his symptoms eased they diagnosed him with the stomach complaint reflux, unaware the true cause of Benjamin's sickness and diarrohea was actually a crippling array of allergies. Over the next few months Mrs Williams started to worry her breast milk could be triggering the condition and, sure enough, her son's condition improved when she switched to a powdered formula. Through a process of trial and error the mother-of-two identified a long list of everyday foods that were making Benjamin ill, and eventually found just five 'safe' foods - chicken, potatoes, carrots, banana and melon. Benjamin, . now aged 20 months, takes steroids and medicines to control his many . allergies, which include Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome . (FPIES) - a condition whereby the body reacts violently to certain types . of protein. But . charity worker Mrs Williams still faces a daily battle to keep her . 'inquisitive, amazing' little boy away from the dozens of substances . that pose a threat to his health. Mrs Williams said: 'You just want to pick him up and give him a cuddle but on his bad days I can't even do that because the slightest touch or knock can bring him out in hives' She said: 'There are just so many things that could harm him - at least 40 so far - but there could be more we don’t know about. 'Broccoli, corn, potato starch, soya, dairy products, cucumber, tomatoes, anaesthetic cream, satsumas - the list is endless. 'The other day I ironed his clothes with scented oil and that brought him out in a rash. It just didn’t occur to me that something as simple as that could trigger an allergic reaction. 'When we went to Portugal for a holiday we tested to see if he was allergic to bottled water - and sure enough he was. 'You just want to pick him up and give him a cuddle but on his bad days I can't even do that because the slightest touch or knock can bring him out in hives' - Kileigh, Benjamin's mother . 'As a mum you have to be constantly on guard. There have been times that I couldn’t sleep because I wanted to watch over him constantly. 'You just want to pick him up and give him a cuddle but on his bad days I can’t even do that because the slightest touch or knock can bring him out in hives. 'You see other children approaching him with chocolate on their fingers and you know it could hurt him. 'His life has been one big battle so far.' Because . Benjamin’s condition is so unusual Mr and Mrs Williams, have arranged . for him to see leading allergy specialists at the private Portland . Hospital in London. They . needed £1,000 just for the consultation but after the family put an . appeal over Facebook friends came forward with the cash almost . overnight. Because Benjamin¿s condition is so unusual Mr and Mrs Williams have arranged for him to see leading allergy specialists at the private Portland Hospital in London . Glyn and Kileigh with Benjamin (right) and his big brother Jack. Kileigh praised her son, she said: 'He's never let it get him down, he never moans or whinges' They now hope to learn how more FPIES, in particular, which causes inflammation of the small and large intestine, leading to violent diarrhoea and vomiting. It differs from normal allergies because the reaction is normally delayed for several hours and there no warnings signs like a rash or swelling. The most common triggers are dairy products and soy however almost any food can cause an FPIES reaction, including rice, oats, certain vegetables and meats such as chicken and turkey. Mrs Williams, whose other son Jack, six, has asthma but is otherwise completely healthy, said: 'Benjamin has been taken to hospital several times when he’s been very unwell. 'But the one person who never complains in Benjamin himself. He’s amazing. 'For his first birthday his cake was a piece of melon with a candle in it but he loved it all the same because he doesn’t know anything different. 'He’s inquisitive, sociable, he just loves life. It’s getting harder as he gets older because he sees what his brother is eating and gets frustrated that he can’t try it himself. 'But he’s never let it get him down, he never moans or whinges. We just need to keep him safe and help get him get the treatment he needs.'","Benjamin Williams is allergic to 40 different food, drinks and medications .

The Chilean international is an authoritative central midfield player and Sportsmail understands that United have made tentative enquiries to establish whether a move will be feasible this summer. Louis van Gaal is keen to add goals to the United midfield and Vidal scored eighteen for the Italian side last season and thirteen during the previous campaign. VIDEO Scroll down to watch new United signing Shaw show off his free kick taking ability . Targeted: Manchester United are after Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal . Preparation: Vidal in discussion with Chile coach Jorge Sampaoli ahead of their last-16 tie against Brazil . Sportsmail understands that Van Gaal . previously attempted to sign Vidal for Bayern Munich when the player was . at Bayer Leverkusen several years ago. It is believed that Juventus are determined to keep hold of the  27-year-old and United were previously knocked back when they enquired about the Chilean’s availability when David Moyes was at Old Trafford. Nonetheless, United’s intention this summer to build a squad capable of winning the Barclays Premier League and Van Gaal will be backed in the transfer market to ensure that he is provided with the best possible opportunity of doing so. And United may feel that a bid in excess of £30 million could force Juventus to alter their position. The club will continue to monitor any developments once Vidal returns from the World Cup and will move in if they receive encouragement from the player or the Italian club in the coming weeks. Cohorts: Vidal excelled in midfield alongside former Man Utd player Paul Pogba . Chaser: Man Utd are also after Arsenal defender Thomas Vermaelen . VIDEO Van Gaal set for German shopping spree . The Old Trafford club are also maintaining an interest in Roma’s Kevin Strootman and Vidal’s Juventus team-mate Paul Pogba, although the Frenchman would command a fee in excess of £55 million. Van Gaal will also step up his pursuit of Arsenal defender Thomas Vermaelen following the World Cup. A wage package is understood to have been agreed in principle and the player’s camp remain confident that a move will go through, although United may have to stump up £11 million to prise the 28-year-old away from the North London club.

"By . Katy Winter . The world's most bling egg has been unveiled in time for Easter - but you'll need to be a billionaire to shell out for this extravagant one-off. A cross between a Faberge egg and the Damien Hirst skull, the 'Mirage' is a unique gem that only the richest can afford. The incredible ornament has more than 1,000 diamonds on the outside 'shell' - worth £1.5million alone - 100 of which are a unique cut. Model Rosie looks at the £5 million 'Mirage'diamond egg which has more than 1,000 diamonds on the outside, 100 of which are a unique cut . The masterpiece opens to reveal a globe which was hand-crafted in . 18-carat gold . Unveiled in time for Easter, you would need to be a persuasive billionaire if you want to buy this expensive one-off . And the diamond-covered egg opens up to reveal an ornate globe, hand-crafted in 18-carat gold. The globe's top shell raises to reveal a delicate rock crystal dove, perched on a gold olive branch. The dove and olive branch were hand carved in gold and were included as symbols of world peace. Mirage has taken three years to make, with work carried out by the world's elite craftsmen across three continents. The globe's top shell is raised to reveal a beautiful rock crystal dove which is perched on a lavish, gold olive branch . Manfred Wild is the main man in charge of Mirage's design and assembly. And with millions spent in labour costs alone, that's a heavy responsibility. Vashi Dominguez, jeweller to the stars, has access to the private owner of this masterpiece, a mystery collector. It was not going to be sold, but Mr Dominguez claims he is working on persuading the anonymous owner to place it on the market. The dove and olive branch were hand carved in gold and were included as symbols of world peace . The egg, which was created by jewelers in three continent over the course of three years, is owned by a mystery collector . At £5 million, Mirage would cost the same price as a posh London home, though at present the owner has no plans to sell it . The egg's private owner had no intention of selling but Mr Dominguez believes if anyone did make an offer in the 'multiple millions' they might be able to strike a deal. Diamond specialist Dominguez thinks Mirage is one of the most valuable jewels ever created. He said: 'Mirage is, quite simply, one of the finest jewels ever created. 'The owner has said he has no intention of selling the wondrous piece, but if someone really wants it I can see if we can come to an agreement. 'The diamonds alone are worth more than £1.5 million while labour costs were around the same.' At £5 million, Mirage would cost the same price as a very smart London home or 30 times the price of a Ferrari 458 Italia supercar. Unveiled just in time for Easter, the Mirage is believed to be one of the most expensive jewels ever made . Every centimeter of the egg and the stand is covered in diamonds and beautifully constructed . If the average Briton saved their entire post-tax salary, it would take them 243 years before they could afford Mirage. However, Mr Dominguez believes the owner would end up wanting more. He added: 'The owner doesn't need to sell Mirage, but it is all about one-upmanship in the world of the billionaire and money does talk. 'Owning this special item would be a great coup for someone for whom money is no object.'","Ornate egg has over 1,000 diamonds in its shell, 100 of which unique cut .

"By . Lydia Warren . Olympic swimming champion Amy Van Dyken-Rouen, whose lower body was left paralyzed in an ATV accident earlier this month, has vowed to walk out of the hospital in August. Speaking with the Today show from Craig Hospital in Englewood, Colorado, the six-time gold medalist, 41, said she is 'not afraid' of the hard road to recovery that lies ahead. She revealed she has felt some sporadic sensations below her belly button following surgery, which gives her hope that she may regain some feeling in her legs and eventually be able to walk. 'This is a new challenge, and I'm taking it head-on,' she said in the interview that aired on Friday. Scroll down for video . Strong: On the Today show on Friday, Olympic gold medalist Amy Van Dyken-Rouen vowed to walk out of the hospital in August - which will mark just two months since she severed her spine in an ATV accident . 'This is more than just for a gold . medal, this is for my life; our life. And so, I'm here and I'm working . as hard as I can for that.' Van Dyken-Rouen severed her spine when an ATV rolled on top of her following dinner with her husband, former Denver Broncos player Tom Rouen, near their home in Show Lo, Arizona on June 6. The case was so serious that she and Rouen said their goodbyes before she went to surgery. She told him to move on and be happy in his life, while he said he understood if she needed to leave him. 'One of the things that I told her was if... all this was too much and she wanted to go, she could go, and I'd understand,' Rouen recounted to Matt Lauer on the Today show. Joy: She returned to the pool for the first time since the accident this week and said it made her feel 'normal' Fighter: Van Dyken-Rouen, 41, goes through physical therapy from 9am until 4pm every day . Battle: She also shared these images showing her pushing herself up off the bed during therapy . But Van Dyken-Rouen, who won four gold medals at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, didn't like that. 'Don't tell me I can't do something,' she told Lauer. 'Don't tell me to give up.' She woke up from surgery with an unwavering positive attitude that she has shared with thousands of well wishers on Twitter and Instagram. Since being flown to Colorado, she has started her rehabilitation and works from 9am until 4pm every day. When asked what is the toughest about it, she said: 'Everything.' But earlier this week, she had some respite when she finally got back in the pool. 'It was the first time I felt quote-unquote normal,' she said. 'This is not normal for me, it will be, but not yet, so I felt normal. I was sculling and my legs were dragging behind me, which they normally would. It was awesome.' Life-changing: An X-ray shows the break in her spine - if it had been a little higher she would not be able to use her hands. She said she has started to feel sensation in her lower body . Still smiling: Van Dyken-Rouen, pictured arrived at Craig Hospital in Englewood, Colorado on June 18, called the accident 'a set back' that she would get past . She shared photos of the experience on Instagram, showing her being lowered into the water and grinning as she moved along. Van Dyken-Rouen recounted how she used to be bad at swimming and overcame her challenges . to break records, and she is now applying the same vigor to her . rehabilitation. 'I suck at getting out of my chair, just . like I sucked at swimming,' she said. 'This is a new challenge, I'm not afraid of . it, I welcome it. This is more than for just a gold medal, this is for my . life, for our life.' She added: 'It's a setback; that's all it is. And then we're gonna rock and roll.' Champion: Van Dyken became the first U.S. woman to win four golds at one Olympics . Lauer questioned her positive attitude, asking her husband if she'd ever broken down - which he said she hadn't. She said she had only really felt emotional and overwhelmed by the outpouring of peoples' love. 'I don't have that in my makeup to sit there and dwell on it,' she said of her attitude. 'Because if I do, I'm going to go down a rabbit hole and it's going to be awful.' See below for video .

"By . Tom Roddy . Adam Lallana’s big-money move from Southampton to Liverpool is set to land AFC Bournemouth a massive windfall of £6.25 million. A deal was struck between Saints and the Championship side after Lallana was poached from the Cherries’ academy at the age of 12. It was agreed that Bournemouth would get 25 per cent of any fee Southampton received for the England midfielder. With Lallana on his way to Liverpool’s Melwood training ground to undergo a medical, the £25 million move is imminent. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Liverpool target Lallana reflect on England's World Cup failure . Windfall: Adam Lallana's move to Liverpool will hand Bournemouth a passive payday . Having finished 10th last season following promotion from League One, the huge pay-out would help Eddie Howe establish the Cherries in their second season in the Championship. Howe has recently lamented the potential loss of key members from his squad, having already lost last season’s top scorer Lewis Grabban to Norwich City. Grabban netted 22 of Bournemouth’s 67 goals, leaving Howe concerned at how he would replace the 26-year-old. Moving on: Lallana first signed for Southampton aged 12, and made his debut for them in 2006 . Big spender: Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe will be hoping to use the money to rebuild his squad . ‘Keeping the squad together may be our hardest challenge, given how well they performed,’ he told BBC Radio Solent, . ‘We’re still very ambitious and we want to exceed what we did last year.’ The signing of former Burnley midfielder Junior Stanislas was confirmed on Thursday but Howe will want to add to his squad and fulfil those ambitions when Lallana’s move to Anfield is complete.","Lallana's move to Liverpool will land Bournemouth £6.25m payday .

"By . Andrew Levy . and Sara Smyth . Parents are being fined £60 if their children are a few minutes late for school in a tough new crackdown on discipline. Two headteachers in the same local authority are believed to be the first to take the action in an attempt to slash truancy rates. The parents of a persistent offender face a £60 fixed penalty – which can be doubled if they fail to pay within 21 days. Fine mess: The headteacher at Emerson Valley School in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, has warned parents they will face fines of £60 if their children are late . Headteachers have been able to impose . financial penalties on the parents of regular truants since 2003, but . Milton Keynes Council has said schools can classify children as skipping . school even if they arrive late. Two schools have adopted the policy, including Emerson Valley School, which was rated inadequate by Ofsted inspectors last year. It . has issued parents with a warning that they will be fined if a child . misses registration ten times in a 12-week term. The school said: ‘The . link between good attendance and pupils achieving well at school is . clear. ‘During the recent . Ofsted monitoring inspection it was noted that “strategies to improve . attendance and punctuality have resulted in a significant increase in . the proportion of pupils who come to school on time”. ‘At . the end of the autumn term 2013, 353 pupils at Emerson Valley School . received certificates for 100 per cent punctuality. This is a big . improvement on previous years and has been achieved through working with . our families.’ School fine: Parents at the school in Milton Keynes will have the fine doubled if they don't pay it promptly (file picture) But the . policy has infuriated some parents. Georgina Hodgkinson, 40, said: . ‘There needs to be a deterrent but I think it puts lots of pressure on . parents and does break the commitment between the school and families. ‘If . you have got, like we have, children in different schools, you are . trying to navigate logistics from one to the other and there  are always . going to be some problems.’ But . another parent, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Kids arriving late . cause disruption and this has made parents sit up and take notice.’ Education experts welcomed the policy, but said it had to be used in the right circumstances. Chris . McGovern, of the Campaign for Real Education, said: ‘If the lateness is . wilful and persistent and the school decides there is no other way . forward, then it is justified. ‘But they have to be careful because it can lead to the breakdown of the relationship between the school and parents. ‘There . is also the question of whether social services should be involved to . see what is going on at home. Schools shouldn’t act in isolation on . this.’ Other local authorities are understood to be considering adopting the system to curb the tide of lateness and truancy. Schools . were originally able to impose a £50 penalty but this was increased to . £60 in September 2012 as part of Education Secretary Michael Gove’s . attempt to restore discipline to schools. The . increase came as record numbers of parents were given criminal records . for allowing children to skip lessons. Some 10,185 parents were found . guilty and sentenced in 2012 – a 3.5 per cent rise on the 9,836 the . previous year. In 2001, just 1,845 people were convicted. A . spokesman for Milton Keynes Council said: ‘Our figures show that in the . last academic year, two fixed penalty fines were issued in relation to . persistent late attendance by pupils. In a majority of cases, a warning . letter has proved to be enough to stop the issue.'","Parents will be fined if their children miss registration 10 times in a term .

Guilty: David Johnson was yesterday convicted of attempted murder at Exeter Crown Court. He will be sentenced later today . Mr Ross had been watching television . at his flat in Exeter city centre last August when Johnson knocked on . the door and falsely accused him of stealing money from a family member. Johnson then launched a frenzied attack by first using his belt to throttle his victim until he passed out. He then stabbed Mr Ross 38 times with a kitchen knife. Mr Ross told the jury: 'He started to get violent. He got out a belt and put it round my throat. In seconds I was unconscious.' He next remembers trying to stand up, stumbling and screaming in pain, and leaving bloody hand prints on the walls in his flat. He woke up in hospital several hours later and was told about the extent of his injuries. Mr Ross said: 'After I saw the photographs the police took I couldn't believe it. If I had been thinner I would have been dead. 'The medical staff tried to be tactful in the way they described it but I am heavier than I would like to be and they said it was that extra weight that saved my life.'

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . A woman has claimed that Covergirl's two-step Bombshell Volume mascara is so hard to get off, it caused her to lose a significant clump of eyelashes in trying. 'I was wiping downward with the cotton ball and noticed a chunk of my eyelashes fell into the palm of my hand', Amy Schavolt, 21, based in West Palm Beach, Florida, tells ABC15. Ms Schavolt was initially impressed with the dramatic results she achieved from the mascara, which Covergirl boasts delivers 'ten times more noticeable lashes vs. bare lashes'. Noticeable indeed! Amy Schavolt claims Covergirl's Bombshell Volume mascara was so hard to get off - even with make-up remover - that she wrenched out a sizable clump of her lashes in trying (pictured) Product fail: Ms Schavolt (pictured) says she was initially impressed with the bold effects of the mascara, but it quickly turned into a 'clumpy, gooey mess' before it caused her lashes to fall out . 'I had a couple of people say ""wow your eyelashes look really nice"" and I was all excited', she says, insisting that she applied the product exactly as instructed; two layers of the 'extreme volume' base coat and two layers of the 'intensifying' top coat. The product quickly transformed into a 'clumpy, gooey mess' however, and disaster struck when Ms Schavolt tried to remove the product with make-up remover. Dr Alan Bauman, a specialist in repairing damaged eyelashes was shown photos of Ms Schavolt's missing clump and deemed her lashes 'traumatized'. 'Eyelashes can take some time to rebound. It can take like two to four months', he told the news outlet, advising consumers to be extra gentle when removing tough products like this one. Shocking: 'I was wiping downward with the cotton ball and noticed a chunk of my eyelashes fell into the palm of my hand' Ms Schavolt (pictured) explains . Alarmingly, Ms Schavolt is not the only one in her predicament. Plenty of other customers have made the same complaint in their reviews of Covergirl's Bombshell volume on the brand's own website. 'Dear God someone tell me how to get this mascara OFF!' writes one reviewer. 'WORST PURCHASE EVER! I'M PANICKING!' 'No amount of make-up remover would remove.

"By . Bianca London . With viewing figures of almost . 10 million every week, ITV's . charming period drama Downton Abbey has been one of the most popular shows to grace our screens. And it seems that a weekly television fix is not enough for some Downton fans who are so enamoured with the upstairs/downstairs lives of . the 1920s characters that they want to emulate them too. Fashion brands have reported increased interest in retro flapper style dresses and demure ruffled blouses as well as vintage nightwear and sharp tailored men's suits. And now, the series, which is set to be screened again later this year, has inspired a vintage wine collection. Downton drinking style: The hit ITV series has inspired a 'vintage' wine collection that producers say the cast would be proud of . French blends imported by the British aristocracy in the early 1900s, like the Crawleys, are set to be to be recreated. The range of Bordeaux clarets and whites will come from grapes grown on the same vines and from the same soil as the era depicted in the popular show. Wines That Rock, a company that already produces the Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd-branded wine, will be producing the wine in collaboration with Dulong Grands Vins de Bordeaux, a 130-year-old wine-making business. Home grown: The wine will come from grapes grown on the same vines and from the same soil as the era depicted in the popular show . Speaking about the collaboration, Wines That Rock co-owner Bill Zysblat said: 'We are working with The Dulong Grands Vins De Bordeaux vineyards, which . have been in the same family for five generations. 'They have over 130 . years of experience in creating the world’s best wines so these are . wines the Crawley family would have been proud to serve at Downton.' In a very un-British fashion, however, the wine will only be sold in the U.S. and Canada, where the show's finale reached an average of 12.3 million viewers, with the entire third series averaging 11.5 million viewers. Stateside hit: There is no official release date for the wine but it's believed that it will coincide with the airing of season 4 in the U.S., where it is viewed by 24 million people . It has become the highest-rating TV drama in PBS's history, reaching over 24 million viewers overall. The Emmy and Golden Globe-winning drama, which debuted on British screens back in September 2010, is now shown in over 200 countries to 120 million viewers worldwide. An official release date for the wine has not been revealed, but it’s believed that it will hit shelves across the US and Canada in time for the fourth season and will be available as individual bottles or gift sets.","Wine imported by the British .

"By . Daniel Miller . Hundreds of thousands of unsold tickets to some of the Olympics' most popular events are being secretly sold to corporate sponsors, despite pledges they would be offered to the British public, it has been reported. The tickets, for events such as the opening ceremony, the gymnastics and the swimming finals, consist of returns that foreign Olympic committees have failed to sell. The Games' organising committee Locog began offering them to sponsors and key officials through an internal ticketing system 12 days ago, but the public have so far been left out. Hundreds of thousands of Olympics' tickets including some for the most popular events such as the opening ceremony have been secretly offered to sponsors . Last year, Chairman of London 2012 ,Lord Coe pledged such tickets should be put up for sale to the British public to help meet 'phenomenal and unprecedented' demand. When tickets originally went on sale last year two thirds of applicants found themselves unable to buy any at all and the opening ceremony was 10 times oversubscribed. The news that the public are being denied the opportunity to apply for the returns has provoked fury. Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Doocey, who is monitoring the Games on behalf of her party, told the Daily Telegraph: 'It’s absolutely disgraceful. 'The principle is completely wrong —there is no way that ticket returns should go to people who have already been incredibly well catered for. 'They should go to the long-suffering public and especially Londoners who have paid for these Games for the past decade.' While there are still more than . 400,000 tickets still available to the public through the official . website, most are for less popular events and are being sold at high . prices. They . include more than 1.1 million football tickets available for between . £20 and £40 as well as around 400,000 tickets to other sports. Lib Dem Peer Baroness Doocey (left) said it was an 'absolute disgrace' that the tickets were not being offered to the public. (Right) London 2012 Chairman Lord Coe . Addressing the International Olympic Committee in July last year, Lord Coe had urged foreign commitees to return unwanted tickets to help meet domestic demand. He said: 'My message is if you have tickets you have not yet sold then please send them back to us. I know people who would like them. 'Both domestically and internationally the demand for tickets has been phenomenal, I would actually say it has been unprecedented. 1.9 million people applied for 22 million tickets, we have 6.6 million to distribute. 'We have sold out in 23 out of 26 sports, that's an extraordinary vote of confidence in Olympic sport, not just in Britain but around the globe.' National Olympic committees were given 12 per cent of tickets to sell, with an additional 5 per cent going to sporting federations and the IOC. A spokesman for Locog confirmed the existence of the internal ticketing system but claimed that tens of thousands' of returned tickets would be put on public sale. She told the Telegraph: 'We are determined that as many returns as possible will go to the British public.'","Public being denied hundreds of thousands of tickets to some of the games' top events .

"By . Sarah Dean . and Emily Crane . and Barbara Jones In Abuja, Nigeria . An Australian man has revealed how he is desperately trying to free the 250 kidnapped Nigerian schoolgirls, who were taken on April 14 by Boko Haram terrorists. Dr Stephen Davis left his home in Perth to travel to the African country after being recruited by the country's president for his hostage negotiation expertise. The girls were taken in a raid on their school in Chibok, in Nigeria’s north-east, by the violent group who want to impose Sharia law on the country. Dr Davis, a friend of The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, has been working secretly in Nigeria for almost a month now. The 250 girls are being held by Islamic group Boko Haram after they were abducted from Chibok, in north eastern Nigeria . The former Canon Emeritus at Coventry Cathedral in the UK, who moved back to Australia last year, told MailOnline: 'I am encouraged by the progress.' He was asked to come to Nigeria after previously brokering a truce between violent rebels and the government in the Niger Delta in 2004. Along with Mr Welby, he was frequently blindfolded and held at gunpoint during his peace work. In an email from Nigeria, the Doctor revealed he has had 'ongoing contact' with the groups involved in the kidnapping in Nigeria's north for seven years. 'This is a long process of building trust on both sides,' he said. Peace worker: Dr Stephen Davis  previously worked with his friend The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby (pictured), in Nigeria in 2004 . This photo taken from the video by Nigeria's Boko Haram terrorist network on Monday, May 12, 2014, shows some of the missing girls . 'There are several groups to deal with as the girls are held in several camps. This makes any thought of a rescue highly improbable. To attempt to rescue one group would only endanger the others.' Despite the difficulties of a rescue operation, Dr Davis remains hopeful that the schoolgirls will be freed. 'Every day there is the possibility of the release of the girls,' he revealed. 'This is painful for the parents and the nation. The well-being of the girls is constantly on our minds and we want to see their release as soon as possible.' Terror leader Abubakar Shekau released a video of the kidnapped girls praying after their conversion to Islam . The Boko Haram leader has declared he would sell the girls into slavery, or marry them off to their kidnappers, if members of his sect were not released from prison . However, he warned: 'We must not endanger their lives any further.' Speaking about his recent negotiation work, he explained he has been to forward military position in the northeast of Nigeria in recent days. He believes 'the troops and their field commanders are doing all that can be done at this point'. On Sunday, a heartbreaking new video of the Nigerian schoolgirls showed them bravely speaking out about their ordeal for the first time. The footage, not released publicly but seen by The Mail on Sunday, was taken in a jungle clearing a month after their abduction. The girls in the video look healthy, but it is understood that fraught negotiations are under way to broker the release several pupils who have fallen ill, including one with a broken wrist. Deborah Peter told US congress members how Boko Haram killed her family in 2011 and called for the release of the kidnapped girls . In the video, eight girls, dressed in their home-made school uniforms of pale blue gingham, plead for release as they stand courageously in front of the camera. They are clearly scared, upset and trying to be brave. Each of them walks in turn to a spot in front of a white sheet fixed to a crude frame between the trees. Four of them can be heard clearly, in their Hausa language, stating that they were taken by force and that they are hungry. A tall girl, aged about 18, says tearfully: 'My family will be so worried.' Another, speaking softly, says: 'I never expected to suffer like this in my life.' A third says: 'They have taken us away by force.' The fourth girl complains: 'We are not getting enough food.' The video, taken by an intermediary on May 19, has been shown to President Goodluck Jonathan. It was intended to serve as 'proof of life' for the girls and to encourage the President to accede to the terrorists' demands. Two earlier videos showed the girls seated on the ground, dressed in hijabs, reciting the Koran, and Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau declaring he would sell them into slavery, or marry them off to their kidnappers, if members of his sect were not released from prison. Pressure from the international community and criticism of the President's slow response to the kidnapping have led to a series of contradictory pronouncements from his government. Martha Mark holds up a photograph of her daughter Monica who is one of the girls kidnapped by Boko Haram . Ministers have declared they will not negotiate with Boko Haram, or consider the release of prisoners, while official spokesmen have said ‘the window is always open for dialogue’. At a Paris peace summit, several West African countries neighbouring Nigeria vowed to join in ‘outright war’ against the terrorists. Britain, France and America pledged their support and have sent teams of military experts and advisers to the region. Intelligence sources have told the MoS of several rescue attempts, one involving the release of suspected low-level Boko Haram members detained without charges or trial. Two attempts were aborted at the last minute when the terrorists took fright while delivering a group of girls to a safe location. Last week Nigeria’s Chief of Defence Alex Badeh said the government knew the location of the girls and claimed that police and military had been ‘following them’ since the abduction. He refused to divulge details, saying it would put the girls in further danger. Sources said Mr Badeh’s announcement may have been the result of government officials seeing the new, unpublished video. They may have been able to persuade Boko Haram’s intermediary to provide details of the location. It is believed the hostages have been split into at least four groups. The Nigerian government has been engaged in negotiations with Boko Haram's spiritual leader Abubakar Shekau in a bid to secure the girls' release . 'The vast majority of the Chibok girls are not being held in Nigeria,’ Dr Davis said. 'They are in camps across the Nigerian border in Cameroon, Chad and Niger. I say the “vast majority” as I know a small group was confirmed to me to be in Nigeria last week when we sought to have them released.' He described how fraught the negotiation process has been. ‘One of that small group of girls is ill and we had hoped we might convince the commander of the group holding her that she should be released so we could give her medical treatment,’ Dr Davis said. ‘There are other girls who are not well and we have come close to having them released but their captors fear a trap in which they will be captured in the handover process.‘ . 'One girl has what I assume is a broken wrist as they demonstrate to me how she holds her hand. I have been told that others are sick and in need of medical attention.’ The heavily armed terror group have moved the girls to a 'safe location' A military source said: ‘This has been a race against time from the minute they were captured. As soon as the girls left Nigerian soil it was always going to be more difficult. 'The government made no attempt at a rescue until a month after they were taken. Now the situation gets more serious by the day. ‘Any sort of attempt to get to them would have to be cleared by the governments of the other nations.’ Scathing condemnations of Nigeria’s failure to address the menace of Boko Haram, ever since a proposed peace deal failed last August – leading to the extension of a state of emergency in three northern states – continued worldwide last week. US Senator Robert Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Nigeria had been ‘tragically and unacceptably slow’ to begin a search. Others say the clock really being watched by Nigerian politicians is not the six weeks and counting since the kidnap but the 11 months to the country’s elections. Opposition politician Nuhu Ribadu has accused the government of ‘total failure’.","Dr Stephen Davis, from Perth, is in talks with terror group Boko Haram .

"By . Mark Prigg . Microsoft is developing a smartwatch to take on Apple's much anticipated iWatch, a new patent has revealed. It outlines plans for a wristwatch that would serve as a fitness tracker and could also function as a music player, phone and messaging device. The watch face itself detaches from the wristband and connects to a charging dock. The U.S. Patent Office has released an application from Microsoft for a smartwatch design that could challenge offerings from rivals such as Samsung, Apple and Google. Nothing has been officially confirmed by Microsoft yet, but previous rumours claim: . The watch will have a removable band that will come in a red, black, yellow and blue. It will be made of oxynitride aluminium, a translucent form of the metal. Microsoft's smartwatch is also said to run a version of Windows 8. Prototypes of the device are being tested by the Surface team and the watch could have the connector featured on the tablet. The application was filed in October 2012, but has only just been released by the The U.S. Patent Office. It shows the gadget being used primarily as a fitness tracker, with an icon hinting it will include a pulse-reading sensor. The project is believed to be headed up by former Nokia CEO Stephen Elop, who runs Microsoft's Devices division. The move will put Microsoft in a market set to explode as all the major manufacturers release their watches . Microsoft will be playing catch-up to Samsung, which released its Galaxy Gear smartwatch last year. Google plans to release the Moto 360 smartwatch in the U.S. this summer, along with a range of other Android powered watches, while Apple has long been rumored to be developing a smartwatch of its own. Several firms have already made a success of smelling hi-tech watches, such as Pebble which says it sold 400,000 smartwatches last year. Earlier rumours claimed Microsoft drafted in the team behind its Surface tablet to help test prototypes of its smartwatch. The' Windows watch' in docking mode, where it can connect to a computer and power . Microsoft's design allows the watchface to be taken out of the strap entirely, possibly allowing it to be placed in other straps or holders for different sports. According to technology site The Verge, sources familiar with Microsoft's Surface plans revealed the company had taken the steps to try and get its wearable tech to market. These claims follow rumours that emerged in April which stated Microsoft was working on a touch-enabled watch as the company aims to cash in on the anticipated boom in wearable electronics. At the time, the computing giant reportedly asked . Asian suppliers to ship 1.5in displays for a potential watch-style . device and one supply executive said he had met with Microsoft . researchers and developers. Whether . Microsoft will actually end up producing the watch is uncertain, but . some investors and technology firms are expecting a boom in wearable . electronics, reported the Wall Street Journal. It's time: Microsoft chairman Bill Gates shows off the firm's smartwatch technology in 2004. Now it has been claimed the company has asked Asian firms to ship 1.5-inch displays for a potential watch-style device . The U.S. company experimented with smartwatches in 2004 with a product called SPOT, which used FM radio signals to send instant messages and view news headlines, reported CNN. But production ceased four years later and the SPOT project, which stood for Smart Personal Object Technology, was eventually pulled last year. The new Microsoft watch is believed to have a removable band that will come in a red, black, yellow and blue. It is also thought to be made of oxynitride aluminium, a translucent form of the metal and will run a version of Windows 8. Earlier this week Apple was said to be hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its own smartwatch - dubbed the iWatch. Apple fan and artist Martin Hajek created these incredible lifelike mockups of an iWatch, whcih he believes could come in two version, with the top of the range being the iWatch S, which has a metal body and leather strap . Martin Hajek also believes Apple will release a lower cost plastic version of the watch, which will come in several different colours . Some gadgets such as Nike’s FuelBand are intended to measure physical exercise, while others can perform similar functions to a smartphone such as receiving text messages or taking photos. California-based startup firm Pebble Technology now makes a watch that wirelessly synchronises with smartphones and vibrates to alert users of incoming phone calls, emails and Twitter posts. High tech: Microsoft experimented with smartwatches in 2004 with a product called SPOT, which used FM radio signals to send instant messages and view news headlines . And a group of students from India have already begun selling an Android-powered watch called Andoirdly. One research firm anticipates the market for wearable smart electronics to be a £7billion industry within just three years. College students from India have launched the first fully-featured Android smart watch with built-in Bluetooth, GPS, Wi-Fi and a camera. The Androidly device can also be used to make calls and send texts and costs £150 .","New patent shows a sports watch .

"By . Will Payne In Detroit, Michigan . These are the first pictures of the tunnel where 12-year-old Charlie Bothuell apparently hid for 11 days while police and FBI agents desperately searched for him, fearing he had been murdered. Charlie was discovered hiding behind boxes and a large plastic drum in a tiny basement while his father Charles IV was being interviewed live on national television, appealing for his son’s safe return. Since his discovery, Charlie’s stepmom has been arrested on gun charges, her two younger children have been taken into care and Charles IV has not been able to see his son as police have taken him to live with his mother. Scroll down for video . Dark passage: Exiting the basement door from his father's apartment - No. 1344 on the right - Charlie Bothuell V walked to his right down the tunnel. The storage closet is to the right, and the exit door, which was oddly left open is further down the corridor . Hiding out: This is the first picture of the storage closet in the basement of the condominium townhouse where it is believed Charlie Bothuell V hid out during the eleven days he was missing . Found: Charlie Bothuell V was found hiding in his father's basement after he'd been missing for 11 days . There have been suggestions that . abuse charges may be brought by prosecutors and allegations that his . father and stepmom may have somehow been involved in his disappearance. His father has angrily denied the claims, calling them, ‘absurd’. But . neighbors in the upmarket condo building close to downtown Detroit have . said they believe Charlie simply ran away and used the tunnel to come . and go as he pleased. One . neighbor even said the home-schooled pre-teen had been spotted out playing . basketball in the neighborhood while law enforcement and family carried . out their desperate search. MailOnline was granted exclusive access to the long corridor that joins all the condos and leads to the outside world. The . outside door is usually locked and only accessible to maintenance men, . but crucially last week, it was apparently open so residents could get . rid of a build-up of trash in a dumpster left outside. That . means Charlie could have left the property in the day, before returning . at night. That would explain why FBI agents with search dogs could not . find the boy during their exhaustive searches. There . is also a communal storage space – seen in our pictures – where . neighbors believe he could have easily hidden. There is even an . accessible bathroom in the tunnel. Missing: The townhouse in Detroit where Charlie Bothuell V was found alive on June 25 . Escape: The door at the end of the tunnel - at the bottom of the stairs - was open all last week because people were putting their garbage in a dumpster. That means Charlie could have come and gone as he pleased. It is usually locked from the outside . Speaking . to the MailOnline, the neighbor, who did not want to be named, said: . ‘As far as I am concerned this kid ran away, then he was found and . that’s it. ‘He ran away two . years ago, that has been in the news, so it doesn’t take a genius to . work out that the most obvious explanation here is that he ran away . again. ‘I have heard he . was seen by some of the local kids playing basketball on at least one . occasion. The door at the end of the tunnel was open all last week . because people were putting their garbage in a dumpster. That means he . could have come and gone as he pleased. ‘In . my opinion he was going out in the day, messing around, eating and then . coming back to stay in the corridor or in his basement at night. There . is even a bathroom down there for him to use. Dad under fire: Charles Bothuell IV leaves the Frank Murphy Hall of Justice on Friday after a court hearing for his wife, Monique Dillard-Bothuell . ’He . could have lasted down there for as long as he wanted. I don’t know his . parents that well, but they seemed like nice people to me.’ Despite . the neighbor’s assertions, there is still a significant amount of . suspicion surrounding Charlie’s parents, with many suggesting he would . not have been able to stay hidden without an adult’s involvement. Stepmom . Monique Dillard-Bothuell was arrested on Thursday after apparently . violating parole relating to a previous arrest on a gun charge. Authorities . had obtained a warrant for Monique Bothuell's arrest on Monday, but . held out until Thursday to take her into custody later claiming the . search for Charlie took priority. A place to hide: Charlie probably called this storage closet home for over a week and he had access to bathroom facilities - and the outside . Relief: Charlie was able to use a toilet located in the tunnel . The . 37-year-old had pleaded guilty to purchasing a pistol without a permit . earlier this year and had been put on a two-year probation period. She was in court today on the gun charge and released on a 5,000 dollar personal bond and ordered to wear a monitoring device. Sources . have suggested that Charles IV, a registered nurse, is a strict disciplinarian, who made Charlie follow strict education and . workout schedules. NBC news . reported that Charlie was made to complete 4,000 strides on an . elliptical trainer without break, possibly on a daily basis. The . news station went on to say that on the day of his disappearance he . took a break from his routine and his stepmom reported him to his dad. Charlie was apparently afraid of his father’s reaction and decided to . run away. Police sources told WJBK that Charles IV allegedly beat his son with a PVC pipe. Blood was reportedly found in the boy's room. The . news channel said that the boy had claimed his stepmother was helping . him hide out and giving him food - but the family attorney has denied . the claim. Arrest: Monique Dillard-Bothuell is arraigned for a probation violation of weapons charges at Frank Murphy Hall of Justice in Detroit on Friday, two days after her stepson was found in her basement . Back with mom: Charlie is now staying with his birth mother . Following his . disappearance on June 14th, Charles IV and Charlie’s biological mother . Africa Shippings who lives around two miles away both made emotional . television pleas for their boy’s safe return. Apparently Charlie would . split his time between his father’s and his mother’s. Charles . IV was on live television on HLN with Nancy Grace on Wednesday when he . learned that his son had been found in the home's basement. 'We're getting reports that your son has been found in your basement,' Grace said. As . the shocked father struggled to comprehend the news - grabbing his . chest and looking stunned - Grace demanded to know whether or not he had . checked his basement. 'I . checked my basement,' Bothuell said. 'The FBI checked my basement. The . police checked my basement. My wife checked my basement. I've been down . there several times. We've all been checking.' He . said that authorities had even brought in dogs to check the basement of . their Detroit townhouse but the boy had not been found. Stunned: Charlie Bothuell IV was shocked into silence on Wednesday when HLN's Nancy Grace told him his 12-year-old son had been found alive in his basement, 11 days after he vanished . Detroit . Police Chief James Craig said when police found the boy, he appeared to . be hiding behind a makeshift barrier of boxes and did not announce . himself. Craig said that he . believes it is unlikely that the boy could have constructed the barrier . himself. He was also behind a large plastic drum and bedding was found . nearby. 'There's no way he . could have erected this make-shift area of concealment, I'll call it,' Craig told WJBK. 'He certainly was excited to see us. I had a chance to . actually talk and embrace Charlie. 'He indicated he was hungry. He appeared fine.' Craig . told reporters earlier Wednesday that the boy's father had taken a . polygraph test about his son's disappearance, but the boy's stepmother . declined to do so. Mr Bothuell's test came back inconclusive, WDIV reported. He also told authorities that Charlie had ran away from home two years ago, but police found him after three hours . Overwhelmed: Bothuell clutched his chest and breathed heavily after learning that his son had been found . The father was on live television on HLN with Nancy Grace when he learned that his son had been found in the home's basement.

"By . Lydia Warren . A 15-year-old accused of brutally raping and murdering his teacher last year has attacked a female guard at his youth facility, it has been reported. Philip Chism, who allegedly killed Colleen Ritzer, 24, with a box cutter after she asked him to stay behind after school, allegedly assaulted the woman at a facility in Essex County, Massachusetts on Monday. The extent of the woman's injuries are not immediately known. 'The . Department of Youth Services is working closely with law enforcement to . investigate an assault that took place on a member of the staff at our . Dorchester facility,"" Alec Loftus, Department of Youth Services, told WCVB, which first reported the assault. Attack: Fifteen-year-old Philip Chism, pictured in court in January, has allegedly assaulted a female prison guard at his youth facility and has been hospitalized to undergo a mental health evaluation . Chism has been taken to Boston Medical Center for a mental health evaluation, the channel added, and the Essex County Office has a security detail assigned to be with him. Authorities . still don't know what motivated the transfer student . from Clarksville, Tenneessee to kill his teacher. He has pleaded not guilty to aggravated rape, robbery and murder in the death of Ritzer, whose body was found in the woods near Danvers High School in October. Her throat was slit and a note reading, 'I hate you all' was found at the scene. Missed: Math teacher Colleen Ritzer, 24, was raped and murdered with a box cutter last October . Chism, who had been asked to stay late by Ritzer to help after school, allegedly followed her into a bathroom on October 22 and attacked her, sexually assaulted her twice, stripped her and then stole her cellphone, credit cars and her driver's licenses. According to investigators, her body was then placed in a recycling bin and carted away to a wooded area behind the school and dumped. During the violent assault on Ritzer, Chism, who was then just 14, allegedly raped her twice - once with a stick. After . dumping her body, prosecutors say Chism returned to school barefoot . where he changed into his soccer clothes and threw away his bloodied . school clothes. He then went to eat a burger at Wendy's and caught a screening of Woody Allen film 'Blue Jasmine'. Police . arrested him later that evening when he was found walking down a busy . highway. He had a bloody box-cutter in his pocket along with Ritzer's . underwear. Last month, Ritzer's parents Tom and Peggie Ritzer issued a video statement speaking about their loss while also thanking the community for their support. 'These . past six months have been a period of great pain and sorrow for our . family and all those who knew and loved Colleen,' mother Peggie said.

"By . Rob Waugh . Updated: . 14:03 EST, 24 January 2012 . The Northern Lights have lit up the skies above Scotland, Canada and Norway after the biggest solar storm in more than six years bombarded Earth with radiation. The Canadian Space Agency posted a geomagnetic storm warning on Tuesday after residents were also treated to a spectacular show in the night sky. Ken Kennedy, director of the Aurora section of the British Astronomical Association, said that the lights, also known as the aurora borealis, may be visible for a few more days. Auroras seen from Norway: A spectacular 'coronal mass ejection' following a solar flare has caused magnetic storms- but rarely are they do form such amazing shapes as this bird-like creation . The northern lights are caused by particles from the sun interacting with our atmosphere - and create spectacular displays of green light . The view from Lapland: A human figure stands out against the green sky . Background movement: People chat while the sky goes crazy above them . The Northern Lights are caused by particles  from the sun colliding with atoms in the outer reaches of Earth’s atmosphere, 60 to 200 miles up.These particles stream away from the sun at speeds of about 1million mph after events called 'coronal mass ejections' on the sun's surface, and are drawn to Earth’s northern and southern poles by its magnetic field.Which atoms the electrons encounter when they hit the Earth – either oxygen or nitrogen – and the altitude at which they meet, determine whether the colours are green, red, blue or purple.The lights have been seen so far south because the solar explosion that sent out the particles was particularly strong. The Northern Lights are sometimes seen . from northern parts of Scotland but the unusual solar activity this . week means the lights have also been visible from as far south as northeast England, a rarity. Geomagnetic storms cause awesome sights, but they can also bring trouble. According to the National Oceanic and . Atmospheric Administration, problems can include current surges in power . lines, and interference in the broadcast of radio, TV and telephone . signals. Radiation from Sunday's flare arrived . at Earth an hour later and will probably continue through until . Wednesday, NOAA experts say. Levels are considered strong but other storms have been more . severe. There are two higher levels of . radiation on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's storm . scale of ‘severe’ and ‘extreme’, space weather centre physicist Doug . Biesecker said. This storm is the strongest . for radiation since May 2005. The radiation - in the form of protons - . came flying out of the sun at 93 million miles per hour. ‘The whole volume of space between . here and Jupiter is just filled with protons and you just don't get rid . of them like that,’ he said, explaining why the effects will stick . around for a couple of days. NASA's flight surgeons and solar experts examined the solar flare's expected effects. Vapour trails: The green wisps shoot through the sky of their own accord . Auroras over Norway this week: The activity this week is the strongest since 2005, say space weather experts . The Northern Lights are seen near the town of Lakselv, at the mouth of the Porsanger Fjord, in Northern Norway . The Northern Lights in Donegal in Ireland: The effect is not normally seen so far south . Canada and Norway saw some of the most spectacular activity . Bright lights: This image shows a solar flare erupting on the sun's northeastern hemisphere. The strongest solar storm in more than six years has bombarded Earth . Awesome: Coronal mass ejections propel matter from the sun out of the sun's magnetic field. They can include billions of tons of matter and travel at up to a million miles per hour . They decided that the six astronauts . on the International Space Station do not have to do anything to protect . themselves from the radiation, spokesman Rob Navias said. A solar eruption is followed by a . one-two-three punch, said Antti Pulkkinen, a physicist at NASA's Goddard . Space Flight Center in Maryland and Catholic University. First comes electromagnetic . radiation, followed by radiation in the form of protons. Then, finally . the coronal mass ejection - that's the plasma from the sun itself - . hits. Into the blue: The green skies continue their dance as dawn breaks . Usually that travels at about 1 or 2 . million miles per hour, but this storm is particularly speedy and is . shooting out at 4 million miles per hour, Mr Biesecker said. Plasma causes much of the noticeable . problems on Earth, such as electrical grid outages. In 1989, a solar . storm caused a massive blackout in Quebec. It can also pull the northern . lights further south. But this coronal mass ejection seems . likely to be only moderate, with a chance for becoming strong, Mr . Biesecker said. The worst of the storm is likely to go north of Earth.","Northern lights over Canada, Norway and UK after biggest solar storm since 2005 .

"By . Katy Winter . Down in the dumps about your love life? If you've tried speed dating, love websites, grindr, tinder and the rest, but still despair of finding the perfect partner, a new venture could leave you flushed with romance. Dating site DoingSomething.co.uk has launched a new singles event: Toilet Dating! A dating website hopes to flush awkward first dates down the toilet by combining alcohol and a guided tour of London loos . The tour involves visiting public toilets and drinking while learning about their history and mingling with other singles . The concept is essentially a pub crawl, which due to the ice-breaking effects of alcohol has always been a popular first date activity. However rather than quaint pubs or swanky bars, the tour stops off at public conveniences. The website has teamed up with London Loo Tours to host one-of-a-kind events with a twist. The new dating experience is currently being piloted in London throughout August, with plans to roll it out nationwide later this year, if all goes to plan. Single men and women are led on a bar crawl around London's Westminster with stops at toilets of historical note along the way. As well as loo puns galore, the evening contains tips and tricks for locating free public loos in London, the history of the lavatory from pre-Roman times to the present, and facts about the politics surrounding the public toilet. Toilet Dating encourages singletons to share their own dating horror stories – toilet-related or not –  to flush away memories of bad dates. Sometimes good old-fashioned candlelight and romance is just so boring... In an over-saturated dating scene, it may be that this rather bizarre concept catches on across the country . A spokesman for DoingSomething.co.uk, comments: 'Nothing would be more awkward than having a first date in a toilet… until now. ‘At worst, the daters will have to indulge in some crap chat - but the experience won't be one they'll forget in a hurry.'","New dating event involves touring public toilets on a pub crawl .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The English chief executive of a Fifa partner company who is suspected of involvement with a ticket-scalping ring was released from prison today. Ray Whelan, of the MATCH group of companies, was arrested on Monday at the Copacabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro, the hotel used by FIFA officials during the World Cup. Police have described Whelan as the 'facilitator' who allowed a large ring of scalpers to have access to tickets, which they re-sold at vastly inflated prices. Scroll down for video . Arrested in Rio: Raymond Whelan (right of left picture), the CEO of Match Hospitality, a subsidiary company of FIFA in charge of World Cup ticket packages, arrives at a Rio police station after he was arrested accused of leading a network that illegally sold game passes . Englishman Whelan, a former agent of Sir Bobby Charlton, was arrested at Copacabana Palace hotel in Rio . Whelan's attorney, Fernando Fernandes, told reporters his arrest was 'illegal and absurd.' Whelan will not be allowed to leave Brazil. He was detained for questioning after the earlier arrests of 11 people, including Algerian national Lamine Fofana. MATCH said in a statement it has complete confidence in Whelan's innocence and that he would return to work. 'Ray . Whelan has been released from police custody and will assist the police . with further enquiries,' it said. 'MATCH have complete faith that the . facts will establish that he has not violated any laws.' The . arrest came as part of Operation Jules Rimet, Brazil police's . investigation into ticket touting which has seen detectives tap phones, . make a total of 12 arrests and seize a number of tickets. Police are investigating the illegal resale of World Cup tickets on the black market and arrested 11 people and seized 131 game tickets last week - at least 70 of them for corporate hospitality. Police said then that an Algerian man arrested as the suspected leader of the scalping ring had connections to FIFA or Match and the original source of the tickets to be sold illegally at hugely inflated prices was 'someone higher up.' Match Hospitality is the main provider of hospitality packages for the World Cup and paid $240million for the exclusive rights to sell corporate hospitality at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups. Blatter's nephew, Philippe Blatter, is the president of a company which is a shareholder in Match Hospitality. Re-selling World Cup tickets for profit is illegal in Brazil and against FIFA rules. Police said they had information from 50,000 phone calls they tapped during their scalping investigation. Of the more than 3 million purchasable tickets for the tournament, 445,500 were allocated to Match Hospitality, according to FIFA. Any unsold or unused corporate hospitality tickets should be returned to FIFA to be made available to the public. Police estimated last week that the scalping ring was making 1 million Brazilian reals ($455,000) per game by re-selling tickets on the black market. They were hoping to get $16,000 per ticket for the July 13 final in Rio, they said. The . Algerian suspected to be the ringleader of the scalpers, Mohamadou . Lamine Fofana, runs a company that is one of Match Hospitality's . customers. Match said . Monday that Fofana's Atlanta Sportif Management and three other . companies, two of them official Match Hospitality agents, had their . remaining World Cup ticket allocations blocked or canceled after some of . their tickets ended up in the hands of scalpers. Match Hospitality: Mr Whelan runs Match, a division of Byrom plc, a company based at Cheadle in Cheshire . Police said that Fofana was only the middle man and appeared to have access to restricted areas at the Copacabana Palace Hotel. Earlier, . MATCH Hospitality announced it had blocked sales to four companies . after tickets were seized from touts by Brazilian police. The . four companies are Atlanta Sportif, whose chief executive was one of . those arrested in Rio de Janeiro, Reliance Industries Ltd, Jet Set . Sports and Pamodzi. Jet Set is based in New Jersey, Reliance is one of India's biggest companies, and Padmodzi is based in Nigeria. A statement from MATCH read: 'Following... the arrest of Lamine Fofana, CEO of Atlanta Sportif, engaging in illegal resales, MATCH Hospitality has cancelled all hospitality packages purchased by Atlanta Sportif for the remaining matches of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. 'Pending further investigations, MATCH Hospitality will block the packages of Reliance Industries Ltd, Jet Set Sports and Pamodzi. 'The customers and agents mentioned above are to co-operate with MATCH Hospitality by helping the authorities with their enquiries regarding the hospitality packages with their names on them found in Mr Fofana's possession, failing which, MATCH Hospitality will cancel their tickets for the semi-final and the final too.'

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Federal authorities have asked to speak with the wife of suspected Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev, her lawyer said. Amato DeLuca also offered new details on Tsarnaev's movements in the days after the bombings, saying 'he was home' when his wife left for work on the last day she saw him alive. Katherine Russell Tsarnaev learned her husband was a suspect by seeing it on TV, DeLuca told The Associated Press. May have answers: Katherine Russell Tsarnaev (left), the American wife of Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev (right), faces questions from the FBI over what she may know about her husband's terrorist connections . Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, and his brother, Dzhokhar, 19, two ethnic Chechen brothers from southern Russia, are accused of planting two explosives near the marathon finish line Monday, killing three and injuring more than 180. A motive remains unclear. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was still hospitalised. Katherine Russell Tsarnaev did not speak to federal officials who came to her parents' home yesterday evening, where she has been staying since her husband was killed during a getaway attempt on Friday. DeLuca said he spoke with the federal officials, but he would not offer further details. 'We're deciding what we want to do and how we want to approach this,' he said. Low profile: Katherine Russell sits in the front passenger seat of a family car driven by her mother, Judith Russell (not pictured), as they leave their home in North Kingstown, Rhode Island today . In the spotlight: Katherine Russell in the car with her mother, Judith Russell (right). Her lawyer said she was 'deciding how to approach' questions from the federal authorities about her husband . When asked whether anything seemed amiss to the wife following the bombings, DeLuca said, 'Not as far as I know.' DeLuca said his client did not suspect her husband of anything. He . said she had been working 70 to 80 hours, seven days a week as a home . health care aide. While she was at work, her husband cared for their . toddler daughter, DeLuca said. 'When this allegedly was going on, she was working, and had been working all week to support her family,' he told the AP.

The eldest of three daughters, to . emergency physician Dr Warren Russell and nurse Judith, she had an upbringing steeped in the values of family and education. It was while a studying at Suffolk University, Boston, that she met Tsaraev, then a promising boxer and athlete. It . was during that time that she converted to Islam and her youthful priorities . appear to have changed as she left in 2010 without graduating. By then her relationship with Tsaraev was intense. Not even his arrest for violently assaulting her in 2009 could change that. According . to Cambridge City Police Department reports of the incident which took . place in July at the Massachusetts home she once shared with Tsarnaev, . when interviewed she described Tsarnaev as ‘a very nice man.’ Through the years: She had a comfortable upbringing as the eldest daughter of a doctor and a nurse . Involved: Russell, circled, is pictured with her high school dance team, third from right on the back row . As it has already been revealed, Tsarnaev . was on the FBI's radar during that time as they were asked to look into . his potential links to extremist groups. She was living with Tsarnaev when he travelled to Makhachkala in 2011 – a trip now attracting the interest of investigators trying to establish whether he met with Gaczhimurad Dolgatov at that time. Dolgatov was a Dagestani jihadist who died in 2012 after a vicious stand-off with Russian security services. DeLuca said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was off at college and she saw him 'not at all' at the apartment they shared with her mother-in-law. Katherine Russell Tsarnaev was attending . university in Boston when friends introduced her to her future husband . at a nightclub, DeLuca added. They dated on and off, then married in 2009 or 2010, he said. She was raised Christian, but at some point after meeting Tamerlan Tsarnaev, she converted to Islam, he said. When asked why she converted, he said, 'She believes in the tenets of Islam and of the Koran. She believes in God.'","Katherine Russell Tsarnaev says husband Tamerlan 'was home' when she left for work on last day she saw him .

"By . Arthur Martin . and Emine Sinmaz . and Ryan Kisiel . Their hate-filled rants on the internet encouraged violent scenes across the country at anti-Thatcher parties. And an investigation by the Mail has discovered that the organisers of the street parties include a young union firebrand, a former Unison branch secretary and committed anarchists. Members of various anarchist and socialist groups used the power of the internet to arrange disgraceful ‘Thatcher death parties’ in various British cities. Scroll down for video . Bryan Simpson, who sits on the executive council for Britain's largest trade union Unite, used Facebook to invite over 8,000 people to the street party in Glasgow on Monday . Law graduate Bryan Simpson, 24, who sits on the executive council for Britain’s largest trade union Unite, was the architect of a vile party in Glasgow. Using his Facebook account, he invited over 8,000 people to the street party on Monday night. More than 1,200 people signed up to the page to state they were going to the anti-Thatcher party. The Strathclyde University graduate later posted an image of himself and friends ‘celebrating’ the death of Thatcher by spraying champagne. He was a central figure at the party, joining a conga line and an impromptu dance after a piper turned up. Simpson, who comes from a respectable Glasgow family, was seen taping up a banner to a statue in George Square and punching the air, and chanting ‘Maggie, Maggie, Maggie – dead, dead, dead’.

Mr Simpson (left) was a central figure at the party in Glasgow (right), joining a conga line and an impromptu dance after a piper turned up . Meanwhile, a group called the Glasgow Anarchist Federation with which he is affiliated, published details of the anti-Thatcher party. A member of the anti-capitalist group wrote: ‘Thatcher is Dead – Party in George Square. 5pm.’ On another popular internet page, anarchist Ian Bone, 65, used his blog to tell his army of followers where the street parties were being held. ‘We’re happy to be described as . disrespectful. I am being disrespectful and I am glad of that. We are . rejoicing at her death, I don’t care about her family or her friends’ - Former Unison branch secretary Rahul Patel . Mr Bone published an image of Mrs Thatcher’s head being cut open by a meat cleaver. Next to the image he wrote: ‘The best cut of all.’ He also encouraged anarchists to meet at Trafalgar Square in London this Saturday to ‘rejoice’ at a ‘class war party’. Mr Bone claimed it would be the ‘best night out since the poll tax riot’. Neither Simpson nor Mr Bone were available for comment last night. In Brixton, more than 300 people began gathering on Monday afternoon chanting ‘Ding dong, the wicked witch is dead’. Former Unison branch secretary Rahul Patel, 54, led vile chants and boasted that he had organised the event through the Brixton Socialist Workers’ Party. He told the Mail: ‘We’re happy to be described as disrespectful. I am being disrespectful and I am glad of that. We are rejoicing at her death, I don’t care about her family or her friends.’ In Bristol, one group used a well-known anarchist website called Indymedia to urge its followers to ‘see the evil Tory off in style’. The internet posting told people to congregate in a particular street in the city on Monday night. Ian Bone, 65, used his blog to tell his followers where the street parties were being held . Organisers sent the message to thousands of activists using social media websites such as Twitter and Facebook. The anti-Thatcher party soon descended into violence. Elsewhere on the internet, Left wing agitators set up a page which said: ‘Margaret Thatcher is dead. This lady’s not returning.’ The authors, computer administrator Jared Earle and musician Antonio Lulic, wrote: ‘How are you celebrating? Let us know... or get to one of the parties near you on Facebook.’ They later told the Guardian newspaper their provocative website had led to them receiving angry Twitter messages from Thatcher supporters telling them to ‘watch their backs’. A group calling itself the Informal Anarchist Federation claimed responsibility for smashing the window of a charity shop in Brixton. Writing on the Indymedia website: ‘On the celebration of Thatcher’s death, we smashed a window of Barnardo’s ‘charity shop’ in Brixton using a concrete slab from a bin on the street. And it was easy. We would of done more if it weren’t for self-proclaimed pacifists violently attempting to arrest us.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The first woman bishop could be announced within months, the Archbishop of Canterbury revealed today. The Most Rev Justin Welby said he was ‘hopeful’ the Church of England’s ruling Synod would scrap the ‘incomprehensible’ ban on women priests being ordained as bishops. But he said groups opposed to move would be allowed to ‘flourish’ within the Church. The Most Rev Justin Welby said the Church had been wrong on women bishops 'theologically' for centuries . The two sides in the debate have become bitterly divided since a controversial vote in November 2012 saw the idea of women bishops defeated by just six votes. The General Synod will vote on the issue again this week, with the Archbishop warning the issue should have been settled years ago. He told BBC One’s Andrew Marr show: ‘I think to the general public this is almost incomprehensible and it’s equally incomprehensible that we are still talking about it. ‘I am hopeful it will pass. I’m not actually focused on what happens if it fails…’ Asked when the first women bishop would be appointed, he added: ‘There is a good chance of the first woman bishop being announced very early in 2015, probably being chosen possibly before that. ‘Theologically the church has been wrong not to ordain women as priests and bishops over the centuries.’ Supporters of women bishops have said they are hopeful of success but others have said they remained concerned as the General Synod has the same membership as in 2012. The Archbishop said he would be 'delighted' to see a woman take his role in his lifetime . Margaret Condick, a lay member of the General Synod from the St Edmundsbury and Ipswich diocese, said the collapse of legislation to introduce women bishops in November 2012 had led people to treat the Church of England with contempt. Last week she urged members of the General Synod to vote in favour of final approval for women bishops when a key vote takes place on Monday at at York University. ""People say 'why have you taken so long, what is the problem?' It is incomprehensible to most people,"" she told the General Synod. ""Someone I know and respect from the evangelical Church said to me after the November 2012 debate 'that was rubbish what is happening?' The vote brought us into disrepute, the wider Church and the whole country is beginning to treat us with contempt."" Mediation and conflict management experts were brought in to help resolve differences between Anglo-Catholics and conservative evangelicals opposed to women's ordination and supporters of women bishops. Rev Welby added: ‘Women will be bishops like all other bishops with . no distinction at all, but we will seek for the groups who disagree with the ordination of women as bishops on theological grounds to continue to flourish within the church.’","Warns the Church has been wrong on the issue 'theologically' for centuries .

"By . Eve Mcgowan . When Caroline Howkins bought her stunning Georgian house Rabley Park eight years ago, she had no inkling of its fascinating film and TV history. It was only when she received a call from a location scout who had used the property before that she learnt the six-bedroom mansion was still listed as a potential setting. She leapt at the chance to have it captured on camera once again. On the box: Six-bedroom mansion Rabley Park, near Potters Bar in Hertfordshire,has featured on both the big and small screen over the decades . ‘It turned out Rabley had appeared in several episodes of The Avengers as well as black-and-white films such as Cast A Dark Shadow starring Dirk Bogarde,’ says Caroline. It is so well known to Avengers fans that a coachload of followers came on a pilgrimage to see where scenes were shot. The house appears in different guises in five separate episodes of the cult 1960s series, which starred Patrick Macnee as John Steed and Diana Rigg as Emma Peel. In a 1967 instalment, called Mission . . . Highly Improbable, it is the home of a man called Shaffer, played by Ronald Radd.  A fight scene takes place on the front lawn, culminating in the character being impaled on a stake. Caroline has gone on to hire out Rabley Park, which is set in 12 acres near Potters Bar in Hertfordshire, to several television companies, including the BBC, which filmed several episodes of EastEnders there over two weeks in 2008. Move star looks: The fees from screen appearances has been put back into improving the £3.95million property, including the addition of and indoor pool with a hot-tub and sauna . A framed photo of the cast and crew standing in front of the house has pride of place in the entrance hall. The property was meant to be the home of Archie Mitchell, played by Larry Lamb. At the time, Archie was the new love interest in the life of the now-departed Peggy Mitchell, and the father of sisters Ronnie and Roxy. ‘He played a millionaire who lived here, and as Peggy walked up our sweeping driveway for the first time she said, “It’s a palace,” ’ laughs Caroline. ‘Barbara Windsor, who played Peggy, was lovely, just as you’d imagine her. ‘It was disruptive but we loved having them here. They fed us very well – there was a catering van, and always lots of biscuits and an urn of tea on the go. ‘On the one occasion we didn’t have access to our kitchen because of filming, they footed the bill for dinner out. ‘Because it’s filmed about six weeks in advance, they picked all my daffodils from the garden and replaced them with plastic roses to give it a feel of summer.’ Famous faces: Rabley Park appeared in five episodes of The Avengers, starring Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg . Caroline is now selling the house for £3.95 million, because of divorce, but she  and her children Luke, 20, and Chaz, 18, have fond memories of playing host to cast and crew members working on various projects. ‘We were invited to the premiere of the film Love’s Kitchen,’ says Caroline, as she leafs through the scrapbooks she has compiled  for each production, including the 2011  movie which starred Claire Forlani and Dougray Scott, and including a cameo from Gordon Ramsay. ‘It didn’t get great reviews but it was great for us. Dougray Scott was very charming.’ The house was also the scene of a teenage party in another British film, Truth Or Dare, which also experienced limited success  commercially. ‘The children were extras, playing party revellers. 'My daughter got to do some work experience with the art department, which was great as she’s now studying an art foundation course.’ Caroline explains that hiring the house  out pays as much as £1,600 a day, the most lucrative job being an advert that was filmed over two days in the kitchen for the food company Sharwood’s. All the filming fees and more have been ploughed back in to the property, on which the family has lavished money. The swimming pool extension, which includes a water slide, hot tub, sauna and gym, set them back £500,000. They also spent £75,000 installing a three-bay garage and £50,000 renovating the two-bedroom lodge cottage. More money went on a state-of-the-art kitchen, including a cool room, and they splashed out £20,000 on  a fountain on the front lawn. Uncovering Rabley’s exciting television career inspired Caroline to delve further into its past, and after trawling through newspaper archives she found it has another, more dubious, claim to fame. On New Year’s Eve, 1823, the house was the scene of a murder when a local constable was shot by a guest of the people who occupied it at the time. ‘The murderer was evading bail over money he owed and had been tracked down to Rabley by bail clerks,’ says Caroline. ‘The constable was badly injured and later died.’ It sounds like a plot twist from one of the many dramas that have been filmed there. struttandparker.com, 01727 790484 .","Rabley Park, near Potters Bar, Hertfordshire is on sale for £3.95m .

"By . Eleanor Harding . A retired accountant who turned to escort girls  after the death of his wife was brutally murdered by one at his £1million home, a court heard yesterday. The body of Winston Fernandez, 69, lay undiscovered for almost a month after 38-year-old Russian prostitute Natalia Woolley beat him to death, it is alleged. The £600-a-night vice girl, who describes herself online as ‘alluring to all men and incredibly sexy’, is said to have descended into a rage after an argument over what services she would provide. 'Alluring to all men': Natalia Woolley, 38, who described . herself on escort websites as 'incredibly sexy . and curvacious', is accused of leaving 69-year-old Winston Fernandez . slumped lifeless against his bed . Jurors heard she repeatedly kicked, punched and stamped on her client before cutting the telephone lines and leaving him for dead. Praise: The court heard that Mr Fernandez had booked Woolley three times previously via an escort agency and even wrote an online review . Prosecutor William Saunders claimed Woolley repeatedly  beat the pensioner and left him dead or dying with injuries all over his body, including 17 fractured ribs and two broken bones in his larynx. Mr Saunders added: ‘The post-mortem showed he had been beaten to death. By beaten I mean punched and kicked. ‘These injuries would have left him unable to move, in obvious pain, and of course he would have had difficulties in breathing as well.’ Mr Fernandez turned to drink and escort girls after the death of his wife Joan 12 years ago, Guildford Crown Court was told. He had booked Woolley three times previously via an escort agency and even wrote an  online review praising her ‘aesthetic curves’ after ‘eight amazing hours’. He wrote: ‘All good – nay, outstanding. It is a pleasure to be with you every time! I have been addicted to you, I will spend [a] lifetime with you!!’ Jurors heard the pair got into a fight during an appointment at Mr Fernandez’s house in Epsom, Surrey, after she arrived at 7.30pm on January 16 this year. Woolley later told police she  had attacked him in self-defence after he pushed her on the bed and tried to make her engage in sex acts she didn’t want to perform. She also claimed he had drunkenly locked her in and tried to swing a bottle at her. But Mr Saunders said this did not account for Mr Fernandez’s injuries, which were inflicted with ‘considerable force’. The court heard that after leaving the house some time after midnight, she called a cab and went home. 'Sexy and curvaceous': The call girl - who plied her trade under the aliases Lenka and Alice - is alleged to have broken 17 of the old man's ribs and fractured the bones in his windpipe in the brutal assault before cutting his phone lines as she left . She later called her mobile network to see whether the location of her phone could be tracked and then changed her number, the court heard. Jurors were told she also revisited the scene a number of times, telling one friend she needed to ‘see if someone was still alive’. Police found Mr Fernandez’s decomposing body slumped against his bed a month later – on February 13 – after a neighbour raised the alarm. Woolley was arrested on April 2 and when police raided her home they seized her cowboy boots among other items. The court heard Mr Fernandez, an alcoholic with a number of health problems, was estranged from his two grown-up sons and had few friends. Scene: Woolley was convicted of the manslaughter of 69-year-old Winston Fernandez with her cowboy boots after he invited her to his £1million mansion (above) in Epsom, Surrey, for sex . The court heard Mr Fernandez, an alcoholic with a number of health problems, was estranged from his two grown-up sons and had few friends. His £1million four-bedroomed detached house was messy and chaotic and he was known to have pestered police with numerous calls. Mr Saunders added: ‘He was a lonely, difficult old man who frequently found comfort in alcohol. He had also recently started to use the services of escort agencies. He used them for company and he used them for sex.’ Woolley, of West Kensington, London, was registered with the Diamond Escorts and 24-Carat Escorts agencies, and used the names Lenka and Alice to ply her trade. The blonde featured in various poses on the agency websites and in one described herself falsely as 26 but ‘mature’. Woolley denies murder. The trial continues.

"By . Meghan Keneally . A new study has shown a link between Twitter usage and the number of relationships plagued by social media-related fights. More than 500 active Twitter users were surveyed and the results showed that the more time an individual spent on the social networking site, the more problems ensued in their relationships. 'Although a number of variables can contribute to relationship infidelity and separation, social networking site usage, such as Twitter and Facebook use, can be damaging to relationships,' the report's author Russell Clayton said. Watching over: A new study showed a connection between the amount that someone is active on Twitter and the likelihood that they will have a social networking-related conflict in their romantic offline relationships . Findings: Russell Clayton, pictured, is a doctoral student at the University of Missouri and previously examined the detrimental effects of Facebook . Mr Clayton, a doctoral student at the . University of Missouri School of Journalism, previously studied the . effect that Facebook had on relationships and now his examination into . Twitter proves that the newer micro-blogging platform is creating a . similar level of jealousy that he found for Facebook. 'Facebook-induced jealousy, partner surveillance, posting ambiguous information, compulsive Internet use, and online portrayal of intimate relationships can be damaging to romantic relationships,' he wrote in the study, released Sunday. 'Since Twitter now allows users to interact in a similar way as Facebook (i.e., write posts and upload images, videos, and location check-ins), the researcher theorizes that the effects of Twitter use on interpersonal relationships are comparable to those associated with Facebook.' For Facebook, he found that if partners stayed 'friends' on the social network, that would delay the healing process because they would go back and look through their ex's activity and photos. In the new study, called ‘The Third Wheel’, Mr Clayton went on to extrapolate that, as a result of the interview with 581 Twitter users, reports of Twitter-related conflict within couples 'significantly predicted' negative outcomes that included cheating and break ups. 'I found it interesting that active Twitter users experienced Twitter-related conflict and negative relationship outcomes regardless of length of romantic relationship,' Clayton said. Perils of Twitter: Though no specific numbers were released of the exact number of divorces were caused by excessive Twitter use, some high profile cases like that of Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin make the likelihood of Twitter-related conflicts in marriages seem very likely . 'Couples who reported being in relatively new relationships experienced the same amount of conflict as those in longer relationships.' One solution that they suggest is to limit the individual's time on Twitter if they begin to notice the outbreak of Twitter-related disagreements. Another option is to take the secrecy out of the equation by having joint accounts that both partners use and have easy access to.","A University of Missouri study shows that Twitter usage can lead people to cheat and cause problems in relationships offline .

"By . Nina Golgowski . An AutoZone employee and Air Force veteran who daringly thwarted an armed robbery at his Virginia store by using his own handgun at the scene has been fired for breaking company protocol. Devin McClean, 23, who worked at the York County store up until about a week ago, says he managed to slip out during the attack, grab his glock .40 handgun from his car and return - frightening away the bandit. 'When I yelled “freeze” and I said “stop, drop the weapon,” he threw his hands up with his gun still in his hand, he started running,' Mr McClean told WTKR. Scroll down for video . First responder: Devin McClean, 23, was fired from his job at a Virginia AutoZone after during an armed robbery at the store he slipped out and returned with a handgun, frightening away the would-be robber . Failed robbery: Police say this man, left, entered the store carrying a gun when Mr McClean, an Air Force veteran, stepped out to his car to grab his glock .40 handgun, right, from his car . Relieving his endangered manager at the front of the store, Mr McClean described his boss' immense gratitude to him after held up by a man police say had robbed more than 30 stores in the last year. 'He was like, ""Thank you Devin, you really saved my life,' Mr McLean recalled of his manager. Two days later, to his entire disbelief, he was fired. 'I thought, what a shame. This guy has really gone above and beyond,' Sheriff JD Diggs told WTKR of AutoZone's decision. 'I mean, what else could you ask an employee to do for you?' AutoZone says they are standing by their policy against employees bringing firearms inside their stores and Mr McClean, a soon-to-be father, will not be rehired despite outpouring upset and support for him. Criticizing: York County Sheriff JD Diggs has criticized the auto store for their decision to terminate Mr McClear from their store while additionally choosing to award the former employee . Now unemployed and with a baby on the way, that support alone, he says, has kept his spirits uplifted as he looks for new work. 'AutoZone’s way of saying thank you - ""Hey, you’re going to be fired"" – it kind of made me feel sketchy about what I did,' he told WTKR. 'After all of this support, it makes me feel good. It lets me know I did the right thing.' The attacker did manage to escape but as Mr Diggs notes and praises, no shots were fired along with any robbery being adverted. 'Would he be wrong by not doing anything by taking no action? No, that’s an acceptable approach. I think that’s what AutoZone doesn’t understand. There’s more than one right answer,' said Mr Diggs. Series of attacks: The would-be robber had robbed more than 30 stores in the last year according to police before making his way to the auto store, pictured, which had been robbed before . Expressing his own support in Mr McClean’s quick-thinking and fearless decision, Mr Diggs says he plans to award him with a Sheriff's Citizens Accommodation Award. 'We do that occasionally when a citizen does something above and beyond, and I think he stepped up,' he said of Mr McClean. 'The initial training for the military instilled those core values,' Mr McClean said of his reaction. 'One is . service before self, that kind of played a role in it, it kind of put my own . life on the backburner for another man’s life.'

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . A Dutch meat trader suspected of playing a key role in the Findus horsemeat scandal has denied duping customers by selling tainted beef. Jan Fasen, who has been dubbed ‘Flash Harry’ by his neighbours, yesterday insisted his consignment of horsemeat from two Romanian abattoirs was clearly labelled when it was sold to French food processors. His regular customers include French company Spanghero, which supplied the company making beef lasagne for Findus in Britain that was found to contain horsemeat. Fat of the land: Meat trader Jan Fasen, second left, has denied duping customers by selling tainted beef. Also pictured is his former partner Marion, right, in this image from their daughter Jennifer's Facebook page . ‘I bought Romanian horsemeat, that’s true,’ said Fasen. ‘But that is what I sold to customers. It was clearly labelled, so I can’t be blamed for any later problem.’ However, in January last year, Fasen was convicted of deliberately marketing South American horsemeat as halal-slaughtered Dutch beef and falsifying documents. He was alleged to have made £3.5 million from the fraud. Rogier Horchner, Fasen’s lawyer in the Dutch town of Breda, said his client had appealed against his conviction and so had yet to serve his  one-year jail sentence. Despite his conviction, Fasen’s company Draap – spelled backwards, it’s the Dutch word for horse – continued to trade in horsemeat and used the same cold-storage warehouse in Breda as part of his business with Spanghero. Glamourous: Jan Fasen is believed to have set up his son Dave and his daughter Jennifer in business. Their mother Marion von Hoekel is thought to have separated from Fasen some years ago . Jeffrey Grootenboer, manager of the Nemijtek cold-store warehouse, said all Fasen’s meat was clearly labelled. ‘It arrives to us as horsemeat and leaves us as horsemeat.’ According to a former colleague who spoke to him when the scandal erupted, Fasen said he was astonished to be the focus of inquiries. ‘He said, “Do you think I’d be dumb enough to get involved in something like this after all I’ve been through?” ’ said the friend. Fasen, who celebrates his 63rd birthday today, may deal in the increasingly murky world of  the trans-European horsemeat trade, but his lifestyle is anything but grimy. He lives in considerable comfort in a £2.5 million gated mansion in Schoten, a suburb  of the Belgian city of Antwerp.  A neighbour said Fasen was often seen driving luxury cars. He is believed to have set up his two children, Dave and Jennifer, in business. Their mother, Marion van Hoeckel, is thought to have separated from Fasen some years ago. Dutch raid Factory linked to British Burgers . Dutch investigators were yesterday carrying out  tests after raiding a meat factory in southern Holland suspected of mixing horseflesh with beef. They want to know whether horsemeat from the Willy Selten plant in  Oss was sold for human consumption as beef that may have been used in British burgers, pies and ready-meals. The country’s food safety authority said it suspected the plant of buying horseflesh from Ireland and mixing it with shredded beef before passing it off as 100 per cent beef. ‘That’s the theory,’ said Willy Selten’s lawyer Frank Peters yesterday. ‘But the investigation is ongoing.’ The Dutch public prosecutor said the probe into Willy Selten, which employs about 100 staff at its beef butchery plant, also covered fraud and money laundering allegations. No arrests were made in Friday’s raid, which underlined Holland’s role as a key distribution hub in the trade in horseflesh for the human food chain. Probe: Dutch investigators were yesterday carrying out tests after raiding the Willy Selten meat factory in Oss where it is suspected that horseflesh was mixed with beef . But finally there's some good news about the horse meat scandal! A Mail on Sunday investigation has found 28 meat products on sale in supermarkets and corner shops across the country to be free of horsemeat. DNA tests were carried out by Worcestershire Scientific Services, one of seven UK official control laboratories. Our shopping basket of goods – many from cheap or frozen ranges – also included chicken, lamb and  pork items, to see if horse was being substituted for other  meats besides beef. Baby foods,  celebrity-endorsed ready-meals, a cinema hot dog and a high street sandwich meal were also tested. The clean bill of health appears to tally with the first test results from the Food Standards Agency announced on Friday. Then there were just 29 instances where more than one per cent of horse DNA was found in 1,929 processed beef meals, and no evidence of any horse at all in 392 tests on raw beef samples.","Jon Fasen has insisted his horsemeat was clearly labelled .

"By . Lizzie Parry . From a distance it may look like a UFO is preparing to land. But rather than being a scene from a Hollywood sci-fi film, these images capture the moment thousands of starlings flocked together into the shape of a spaceship. Nature photographer Damian Waters caught the extraordinary spectacle, as he watched the birds swarm to seek the warmth of nearby cattle sheds. Swarming to seek shelter in a nearby cattle shed, thousands of starlings gathered together in the skies over Rigg near Gretna in Scotland, to form the shape of a spaceship . Nature photographer Damian Waters travelled to Scotland with the hope of capturing the phenomena. He watched as the birds soared above his head creating stunning images in the winter sky at dusk . As they soared above the 44-year-old's head, they created an array of shapes in the winter sky at dusk in the skies over Rigg, near Gretna in Scotland. Mr Waters travelled 110 miles from his home in the Wirral, Merseyside, to photograph the phenomenon of the starlings flocking together. The persistent snapper waited for nearly two hours until the first of the birds appeared. He said: 'At first there were just small groups of starlings in the fields, before they started to come in squadrons of 40 or 50, flying all over. 'Then suddenly, before I knew it, there were thousands all amalgamating together and they had formed the shape of a UFO. 'It was spectacular to watch.' The images show the birds taking flight, filling the sky as though it was thick with smoke during the last few hours of sunlight. Another shot reveals the swarm of birds gliding together to mimic the shape of a dolphin. This image shows the birds flocking together forming the shape of a dolphin with some leading, depicting the nose while thousands in pursuit gather to create the body, fin and tail . Mr Waters said: 'Starlings have a bit of a bad reputation. People see them in their gardens and think they are raucous and ugly, or that they bully other birds. But when you see them like that, it's one of nature's greatest spectacles' Some fly ahead to form the head and nose, while those in pursuit funnel together to capture the shape of the mammal's fin and tail. But Mr Waters said he had just minutes to secure the stunning shots, before the sun disappeared beyond the horizon and the starlings fled, seeking shelter for the night. He said: 'I'd been waiting for a couple of hours before they arrived, and I was starting to think I wasn't going to have any luck. 'I was aware it was getting darker and when it started to rain I thought: ""Well, that's the end of that, then"". 'Luckily it was only a shower though, and the birds turned up at around 4pm. 'But after about 10 minutes, as quickly as they arrive, they are gone. 'You have be to there at exactly the right time - if I'd got there at 4.15pm, I'd have missed it all. Mr Water added: 'I have never seen anything as big as that. 'It must be one of the biggest flocks in the country. 'Starlings have a bit of a bad reputation, though.

"By . Lizzie Parry . A little girl born with a rare genetic condition which caused her to be born with an over-sized tongue is preparing to start school after three pioneering operations to correct the problem. Olivia Gillies was born with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), which affects one in 15,000 babies born in the UK. Her mother Emma, 29, and father Ian, 40, were shocked when they discovered their unborn daughter's condition during a routine scan. But four years later the couple are preparing to wave Olivia off for her first day at primary school, after the youngster had three operations to reduce the size of her tongue. Olivia Gillies was born with the rare genetic condition Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome, which caused her tongue to grow to an unusually large size. She is pictured in September 2010 preparing to go into the operating theatre for her first reduction surgery . Her parents Emma, 29, and Ian, 40, discovered their unborn daughter's condition when they went for a scan seven months into Emma's pregnancy. It affects around one in 15,000 births in the UK each year and is typically characterised by an enlarged tongue . Mrs Gillies, of Welwyn Garden City, pictured with her daughter shortly after she was born, said: 'When Olivia was born I had less than a minute to hold her before she was rushed through to special care' Mrs Gillies, of Welwyn Garden City, said: 'When Olivia was born I had less than a minute to hold her before she was rushed through to special care. 'It was difficult to be separate from her in those first hours, seeing the other parents on the maternity ward with their children. 'Ian kept running between the wards, showing me pictures of her. I finally got to hold her eight hours later. 'Her tongue was protruding from her mouth, but I wasn’t shocked. I loved her instantly.' Olivia’s BWS was diagnosed after a scan at the Lister Hospital in Stevenage when Mrs Gillies was around seven months pregnant. Mrs Gillies, a former admin assistant who has four other children, Amy, 15, Tiernan, 13, Hayden, six and Mia, three, said: 'They could see her protruding tongue on the scan. 'We were told it was an overgrowth disorder - parts of Olivia’s body, including her internal organs, would be larger than normal. 'I went home and searched online for BWS. It wasn’t a very good idea, and it left me quite shocked. Information on websites often focuses on worst-case scenarios.' Mrs Gillies said despite her newborn's daughter's tongue protruding from her mouth, she wasn't shocked and 'loved her instantly' Since she was born Olivia, now four, has undergone three operations to reduce the size of her tongue . Olivia pictured in February 2011, after her first operation in September 2010, and shortly before going back into the operating theatre in March 2011, for the second procedure. It wasn't until Olivia had been through her third operation in March 2012 that doctors were confident her tongue would develop normally . Olivia, pictured at Christmas last year, is now preparing for her first day at school . Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a congenital overgrowth disorder, which can affect all parts of the body. BWS is a rare genetic condition, affecting around one in every 15,000 births. The figure is likely to be higher in reality, with mild cases rarely diagnosed. Cases have been reported in most developed countries, and in the majority of cases it appears to be an isolated case with no known relatives suffering the disorder. In some cases there is evidence the condition can be inherited. Children with BWS are often born prematurely but are larger and heavier than expected, given their early arrival. Typically a child born with BWS will have an enlarged tongue, which can causes breathing, feeding and speaking difficulties, as well as excessive dribbling. It can also cause respiratory problems and result in a protruding lower jaw. Babies can be born with reddended skin on the forehead and eyelids, which usually fades in the first few years. Children born with BWS are at risk of developing various types of tumours. Around 7.5 per cent will develop a Wilms Tumour, a tumour of the kidney. Due to the aggressive nature of these tumours, a child with BWS will need to be screened every three months until the age of seven or eight, when the susceptibilty to the tumours diminishes. Children with the condition are also likely to suffer enlarged abdominal organs, overgrowth of one half of the body, liver tumours and an enlarged heart or heart defects. BWS is diagnosed genetically in 80  per cent of cases, with the remainder being diagnosed after a clinical examination. Source: Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome Support Group . Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a rare disorder caused by an imbalance in the genes governing growth rates. Sufferers can experience problems with abdominal wall tissue, enlarged tongues, enlarged limbs and, in some cases, hearing loss and heart disorders. Mrs Gillies and her husband, a chef, were allowed to take Olivia home on the understanding she would need operations to reduce the size of her tongue while she was still a baby. She said: 'When we brought her home our other children were over the moon. They were so happy to have their little sister with them for the first time. 'Unfortunately I couldn’t breast-feed her. She had to be fed by a tube for a long time. There were concerns that the tongue would cause problems with her breathing, so we were quite cautious. 'We took Olivia to a check-up appointment at Great Ormond Street when she was 15 weeks old and a cranio-facial consultant was concerned enough to admit her to a ward urgently.' Olivia eventually underwent her first tongue reduction operation in September 2010, when she was six months old. Mrs Gillies said: 'By then her tongue was so large it was covering her chin. We knew she would need an operation eventually, but we didn’t know she would also need a tracheostomy. 'To hear she would need such help to breathe came completely out of the blue and we were quite shocked. 'She coped fine after the operation. She was already being fed through a tube so, unlike other children who have been through the operation, she didn’t have to cope with eating with stitches on her tongue. 'We kept up with her painkillers and she got through it fine.' Despite early hopes that a single operation would be enough to correct the problem, Olivia required two more operations in March 2011 and March 2012 before doctors were confident her tongue would develop normally. Olivia at her fourth birthday party in March this year. Her mother Mrs Gillies said: 'We¿ve always been a close family, and we helped to keep each other calm during moments when we weren¿t clear on how things were going to turn out for Olivia' Mrs Gilies said despite have some problems walking and talking, her daughter is hitting all her milestones as expected. She added: 'After everything that happened, she's a very happy child' In October 2012, Olivia’s tracheostomy was repaired and today she eats and breathes unaided. Mrs Gillies said: 'She was a little late walking and she is still learning to talk properly - family members can understand but strangers sometimes struggle to follow her. But she is hitting all her milestones more-or-less as expected. 'We’ve always been a close family, and we helped to keep each other calm during moments when we weren’t clear on how things were going to turn out for Olivia. 'I’ve also found good support on Facebook among families of other children with the condition, although it’s extremely rare for a child to have BWS and require a tracheostomy, as she did. 'She’s extremely cheerful and loves playing with her brothers and sisters. She’s doing amazingly well at school, and has got lots of friends. 'After everything that happened, she’s a very happy child.'","Olivia Gillies was born with Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome .

"By . Emily Davies . Andrew Fuller changed his name to avoid detection . A greedy property developer who conned a bank out of millions of pounds to fund a lavish lifestyle has been jailed. Andrew Fuller, 46, was imprisoned for six years and three months after pleading guilty to fraud and forgery. He also admitted possessing a passport under a false name - which he obtained in a bid to evade justice. Maidstone Crown Court heard Fuller's scam started after he bought a property in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, in late 2002, with a view to converting it into 19 luxury flats. In 2005 he secured a £5.7 million loan from a bank, claiming he would use the money to develop the site, known locally as Kingswood Birches. It was agreed with the bank that repayment would be made only once sales of the proposed flats had been completed. In late 2007, the first three apartments were completed and were sold for about £350,000 each, reducing the debt owed by Fuller to £5.3million. The remaining 16 properties were completed in 2008, but due to the economic downturn, Fuller was unable to sell the flats. Fuller was told by the bank which loaned him the money that he must not let any of the properties out to tenants, as the apartments would lose value on the open market. But ignoring the bank's instructions, Fuller started to rent out some of the flats and rather than using the income to pay back the loan, he pocketed it. The rent he received was used to fund extravagant shopping trips, luxury hotel stays in Knightsbridge, London, and holidays abroad. At Maidstone Crown Court Andrew Fuller, 46, was jailed for six years after pleading guilty to fraud and forgery . By May 2009, the bank was having problems contacting Fuller. All his mail was being returned to the bank, stating he had 'gone away'. Further checks revealed that by July 2009 the majority of the remaining flats at Kingswood Birches had been sold without the bank's knowledge. Fuller, who had fled to the Far East, had sold the properties and not used the proceeds, about £3.137 million, to pay back his loan. Fuller was eventually arrested by police in December 2012 at an address in Bath, Somerset. In interview, he accepted full responsibility and also admitted changing his name by Deed Poll and obtaining a passport in the name of Andrew Templar to avoid arrest. Sentencing Fuller, Judge Jeremy Carey told him: 'This fraud is about as serious as any that comes before the court because of the value, in excess of £3.5million, and your actions in the way the money was dissipated. 'The offence was pure greed on your part.' Investigating officer Detective Sergeant Adrian Brown, from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said: 'My team worked hard to sift through the deception and deceit created by Fuller who decided that once he could not afford to pay back the bank he was going to live the high life of a successful businessman which he clearly was not.' Police tracked down Andrew Fuller in Bath, Somerset and he had changed his name to Andrew Templar .","Andrew Fuller, 46, owed £5.3million to a bank but kept profits of £3.5million .

"Flocks of birds fell from the sky in California inspiring the 1963 classic film . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 12:53 EST, 29 December 2011 . The bizarre event which inspired Alfred Hitchcock's cinematic masterpiece The Birds has finally been explained. The director was said to have based the 1963 film on a creepy incident in California, where flocks of frenzied, dying birds flew into the windows of homes in Monterey Bay. Scientists have come up with an answer for the freak of nature - that the birds had been poisoned by toxic plankton. Birds of prey: The iconic image from Hitchcock's The Birds (starring Tippi Hedren) which was reportedly based on a real incidence in California when flocks of seabirds crashed into houses and died . Terror from the skies: The Birds told the story of a small town in California where citizens were maimed and killed by vicious birds . 'I am pretty convinced that the birds were poisoned,' said ocean environmentalist Sibel Bargu of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge to USA Today. The scientists came up with the theory after studying the stomach contents of marine life from the time of the birds' deaths in 1961. They discovered toxic algae on three-quarters of the plankton the birds ate which damaged nerves - causing seizures, disorientation and finally, death. The algae were believed to have become poisonous after being infected from leaky septic tanks, installed quickly during the housing boom in the Sixties across California. At the time, police officer Ed Cunningham had been on patrol when a deluge of dead birds began to land on his squad car at around 2:30 am. The officer told the Santa Cruz Sentinel in 1961: 'By the time I had stopped the car they were raining down all around me. Freaky: A police officer picks up dozens of dead sea birds which fell from the sky in Monterey Bay, California in 1961 . Getting in a flap: Crows chasing schoolchildren and sparrows invading a home in the horror film The Birds . 'They were big birds and they were . falling so fast and hard they could have knocked me senseless. I thought . I had better stay in the car and that's just what I did.' The horror/thriller classic The Birds tells of a . wealthy woman (played by actress Tippi Hedren) who follows a potential . love interest to his home town in Northern California which comes under a . plague of vicious birds, killing and maiming residents and forcing them to hide inside boarded up homes. The title came from a short story called . The Birds written in 1952 by Daphne Du Maurier but Hitchcock was said . to have requested copies of newspapers in California around the time of . the real-life bird deaths. Hitchcock's 49th film was met with critical acclaim, receiving a prestigious debut screening at Cannes and was nominated for an Oscar for special effects. Alfred Hitchcock developed a dangerous obsession with Tippi Hedren – star of The  Birds – which blighted both their careers. A new drama, The Girl (starring Sienna Miller, pictured, as Hedren) is currently being filmed and depicts an infatuated Hitchcock, 62, sexually harassing the blonde starlet, 31. He controlled all aspects of Hedren's life including her diet and off-set wardrobe, even forbidding her to drive with male co-stars. She finally quit when he made it . clear that she would never work again unless she . gave in to his sexual demands. Tippi’s . decision to walk away stalled her career because Hitchcock kept her to . her contract and refused to allow her to work with other directors. But . the collapse of the couple’s working relationship also had a . devastating impact on the director, whose long run of hit, classic . movies dried up. Tippi Hedren, a model who was in her first starring film role, won a Golden Globe for best newcomer. Hundreds of birds (gulls, ravens and crows) were trained for the film, while mechanical birds and animations were employed in other scenes. The film embodies typical Hitchcock techniques to ramp up the suspense. There is no musical score just an electronic soundtrack of bird cries and flapping wings. The British director's skilled filming techniques were also employed giving the audience the impression of the camera looming over them or putting viewers on edge by using a distorted perspective. Hitchcock had originally wanted Cary Grant and Grace Kelly to play the lead roles in The Birds. Grant had previously appeared in the celebrated North by Northwest while Kelly was equally successful in Rear Window (1954). He opted for Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren - who he had spotted by chance in an soda advert. He tied the actress into an exclusive contract for several years and later became dangerously obsessed with her. The Birds also contains one of Hitchcock's famed cameos. In this film, he is the man walking dogs out of the pet store at the beginning of the movie. As with many of Hitchcock's masterpieces, the end of the film is riddled with ambiguity. The reason for the birds' attack is never revealed - and mysterious forces are alluded to. The freak bird fall which inspired the Hitchcock horror film has not been the only recorded incident of strange deaths. Randall Cerveny, a professor of geography at the School of Geographical Sciences & Urban Planning at Arizona State University in Tempe, listed several examples for USA Today. One of the earliest examples was in Baton Rouge, July 1896, when wild ducks, woodpeckers and catbirds fell from the sky and cluttered the streets. One theory is that a strange windfall drove the birds inland from the Florida coast and a sudden change in temperature killed them en masse. On September 11, 1948 in New York City, thousands of different kinds of birds were killed when they crashed into the Empire State Building. An explanation was never worked out as 'there was no fog and weather conditions were good during the night and morning' according to a book written in 1961, Mysterious Fires And Lights. The Master of Suspense: The Birds (1963) was British director Alfred Hitchcock's 49th film and based on a freak incident when birds fell from the sky in California several years earlier .",Flocks of birds fell from the sky in California inspiring the 1963 classic film .
"By . Tara Brady . Updated: . 04:38 EST, 6 February 2012 . Eyewitnesses have described the harrowing moment when 'bombs fell like rain' during the worst violence seen in Syria since protesters began their uprising last year. More than 200 people, including women and children, were killed by President Bashar al-Assad's Syrian forces in the city of Homs which was battered by mortars and artillery overnight. Wounded civilians took refuge at a mosque in the Khalidiya district which took the brunt of the shells fired by government forces. Prayers: Residents attend a burial ceremony in Homs where 'bombs fell like rain' Dead: A stand-off in the city of Homs claimed the lives of more than 200 lives . Funerals: A burial ceremony for the victims of a shelling by the Syrian army . Residents including Omar Shakir . described a night of terror. He told the Sunday Times: 'It was like a . machine gun shooting randomly, only much, much heavier. 'The bombs fell like rain. You didn't know where they would fall. You could only pray.' Several hospitals treating the dead and dying were raided by security forces, according to activists' reports. The Syrian regime has denied the assault - accusing activists of engaging in a 'hysterical' propaganda campaign - while countries around the world spoke out against the atrocity. A UN Security Council resolution was vetoed by Russia and China just hours after fighting broke out. The vote saw all of the other 13 council members, including the UK, US and France, vote in favour of the resolution. Foreign Secretary William Hague said Russia and China now had 'blood on their hands'. The international community was 'not contemplating military action' however, he declared. Speaking to Sky News, he said: 'The main way forward now is for the Arab League to pursue their plan in any case. 'They do not need the permission of the United Nations, although it would have been good to have a clear mandate. 'They should pursue their plan, they should intensify their own pressure . on the Assad regime to stop the killing and allow a peaceful political . transition.' Mr Hague said the UK and allies had made 'huge efforts' to secure . support from Russia and China.

'Disgusted': Russian representative Vitaly Churkin, centre, provoked international outrage after vetoing a . draft resolution backing an Arab League call for Syrian President Bashar Assad to step down . Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said the UN stalemate was 'a stain on the conscience of the world' - and called on Mr Hague to make a statement to MPs tomorrow. Immediate measures should include hardening asset and travel bans and economic sanctions, he suggested. And he said he 'would not rule out' joining any coordinated move to withdraw ambassadors. Meanwhile, former prime minister Sir . John Major told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show the UN should now not lead . international efforts over events in Syria. He said: '(Russia and China) are effectively giving the green light for a pretty bad regime to murder people. 'One needs to put it bluntly so they understand what they have done and so the world understands what they have done. 'If . China and Russia have vetoed it once, let us see if they will veto it . again as public pressure and international condemnation builds up.' Groups gather and chant in huge demonstrations against Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in Baba Amro, near Homs . Tunisia's prime minister said that . cutting ties with the Syrian regime is the 'least that we can do' in the . face of escalating violence, and asserted that Russia and China misused . their U.N. Security Council veto. Hamadi . Jebali spoke at an annual gathering of security officials in Germany, . where Yemeni Nobel Peace Prize winner Tawakkul Karman also said Russia . and China bear moral responsibility for killings in Syria and urged . governments to expel Syrian ambassadors. The Syrian people 'are expecting deeds, they are expecting concrete measures,"" Jebali said at the Munich Security Conference. 'We have to expel the Syrian ambassadors from Arab countries and other countries. 'The very least that we can do is to cut our relations to the Syrian regime,' Jebali said. Rubble: Rasten, near Homs, have been damaged from shells . He also criticised the 'excessive use of the veto' in the U.N. Security Council. 'This is a right that was misused, and undoubtedly the international community has to reconsider this mechanism of decision taking.' Karman, one of the winners of last year's Nobel Peace Prize, had sharper words for Russia and China. 'Those two countries bear the moral and human responsibility for these massacres,' she said. 'I urge you in the name of the peaceful rebels to expel Syrian ambassadors from your countries and I urge you to call back your ambassadors in Damascus,' Karman said to delegates. That is the minimum you can do to punish this regime, and I also urge you to take the necessary measures to protect the Syrian people.' Protest: Police force back protesters at the Syrian Embassy in London this week . The Syrian authorities have responded to . anti-government protests with overwhelming military force since they . began in March 2011. Assad is trying to crush the revolt with a sweeping crackdown that has so far claimed thousands of lives, but neither the government nor the protesters are backing down and clashes between the military and an increasingly bold and armed opposition has meant many parts of the country have seen relentless violence. The U.N. said weeks ago that more than 5,400 people have been killed in violence since March. Hundreds more have been killed since that tally was announced. Violence erupted at the Syrian Embassy in London yesterday. Police using riot shields forced the demonstrators back after they broke through barriers.","Foreign Secretary William Hague accuses Russia and China of turning their backs on the Arab world .

"By . Oliver Todd . Follow @@oliver_todd . Ryan Giggs has admitted he was not ready for the Manchester United job when he took over as caretaker-manager at Old Trafford last season. Giggs took over at United after David Moyes was sacked with four matches of the season left, winning two, drawing one and losing one. There was talk of United's record appearance-maker getting the job full time but the club instead plumped for Holland boss Louis van Gaal as Moyes' replacement.

The Welshman is now completing his Pro Licence coaching badge as he prepares for life as Louis van Gaal's assistant, but knows he has much to learn if he is take the United job on a permanent basis in the future. 'When I took the job there were a lot of things that I was quite happy with, but there and was the odd thing where I thought ""I'm not quite ready for this"". Well it wasn't that I wasn't ready for it, but I could do with a little bit more experience,' Giggs told thefa.com. 'I have gained that experience from Sir Alex (Ferguson) but last year I was still playing so I wasn't really focused on the coaching and the other side of things. Learning from the best: Giggs spent years working under Sir Alex Ferguson as a player at Old Trafford . 'This year I can put everything into it and learn from someone who has managed at the top in so many other countries. It has been a good thing that I have been with Sir Alex for so long but also I am now getting to see how other people work as well. I got a taste of David Moyes and now Louis van Gaal this year.' Giggs has now hung up his boots after an illustrious career, but was still playing at the time of his elevation last season - an adjustment he struggled to deal with. Mentor: Giggs will be working with United's new midfield signing Ander Herrera, who arrives from Bilbao . 'Yeah, I mean there was just so much to do,' he said. 'Before training you are in at half seven and by the time half ten had come you were knackered. 'Because I was still a player I just wanted to make the players aware that I was the club manager and get that distance away from them initially to say: ""I am not joining in training, I am looking to see what you are doing"". You can't really do that if you are getting involved. 'Initially that was my feeling - not get involved with training and see how they were all performing. The majority of the lads were all fit so I had plenty to choose from so I wanted to get a good look. If you are involved and in the middle of it you don't quite get the same look.'

"EXCLUSIVE By . Rebecca English . He was dubbed London’s first paparazzo, and was so loathed by the Royal Family that Prince Philip suggested sending him to the Tower. Ray Bellisario - ‘that bloody Bellisario!’, as Princess Margaret used to call him - was a constant presence at royal events in the Fifties, Sixties and Seventies, taking candid shots of the Queen and her family. Ironically, even those deemed his most ‘controversial’ are unlikely to raise an eyebrow today, but in those rather more deferential times, Bellisario was a thorn in the monarchy’s side, shooting the Queen relaxing on family picnics, Prince Charles waterskiing and Princess Anne as a young bathing belle. One¿s family seat: Prince Charles in June 1970 whizzing across the lake at Sunninghill Park on a chair balanced on a table . On the water: Charles tries his hand at more conventional waterskiing. The photograph was taken by Ray Bellisario - 'that bloody Bellisario!', as Princess Margaret used to call him . Now aged 77, Bellisario is putting his entire 23,000-strong catalogue and its copyright up for auction in aid of charity. It is hoped the collection will raise upwards of £500,000. Among the many interested parties, it is rumoured, are those with connections to the Royal Family who wish to buy up the lot to take them out of circulation. It was the year after the young Queen was crowned — 1954 — that the 18-year-old novice photographer, the son of Italian immigrant ice cream sellers, took a picture of her sheltering under an umbrella that was published by several newspapers. Bellisario realised he was on to something and decided to concentrate his efforts on the Royal Family, but seek something different from the rest of the press pack. ‘It was a business decision, nothing more, nothing less,’ he recalls from his home in Spain. ‘I used a mixture of common sense and contacts. Of course I got tip-offs, but I also thought about things very laterally.’ Bellisario used to infuriate Prince . Philip, who frequently remonstrated with the photographer in the . coarsest of terms, also ensuring that he was blacklisted by most British . newspapers (although his pictures were published abroad). It goes like this, Ma'am: The Queen (left) dances the Twist with a friend in a rare unguarded moment at Balmoral in August 1962 . The innings and outs of a royal childhood: Prince Andrew bowling in a game of cricket in Holland Park, west London, in July 1967 . Some of his photographs, such as the one of Prince Charles sitting on a chair while waterskiing on the lake at Sunninghill Park, Windsor, show a fun side to the Royals, rarely seen in public. 'I used a mixture of common sense and contacts. Of course I got tip-offs, but I also thought about things very laterally' Ray Bellisario . Bellisario had been standing on a footpath by the lake when he was approached by Princess Margaret’s then husband, Lord Snowdon, who told him: ‘If you hang on we’ll do something that will really make your pictures. Keep an eye out for the chair!’ Bemused, he waited and soon Prince Charles came whizzing past, sitting on an old chair, which had been balanced on an upturned table, with grinning Snowdon at the wheel of the speedboat. Other images, however, capture some . truly historic moments — such as the Queen meeting with her supposedly . estranged uncle, the Duke of Windsor, who had come to London in 1965 for . eye surgery. The ‘grey . suits’ at Buckingham Palace, as courtiers are often known, publicly and . emphatically denied that she had any plans to meet her uncle, given the . family’s continuing bitterness over his 1936 abdication. Costume dramas: Princess Anne (left) suns herself in Malta and Prince Charles (right) cycles in Cambridge as a student, both in 1969 . On the ball: A kickabout for Prince Andrew (centre) in 1967. Ray Bellisario is putting his entire 23,000-strong catalogue and its copyright up for auction in aid of charity . The photographer said: ‘The information that I had received, however, was that he was going to the Palace every day to walk in the gardens as part of his recuperation, so I rang the palace once again. “Mr Bellisario,” said the secretary, “how can she be meeting him if there is no contact between them whatsoever?” ‘I hired a room on the 19th floor of the Hilton Hotel on Park Lane, which overlooks the palace gardens, and dusted off my longest lens. 'Sure enough, one afternoon I saw the . Duke walking out around the gardens, followed a few yards behind by the . Queen with her corgis scampering around her legs. The picture was used . in Paris Match as no British newspaper would touch it.’ Eventually, . Bellisario tired of his fights with the Royals and went abroad, earning . plaudits for his work covering conflicts in Northern Ireland, the . Western Sahara and the Nigerian Civil War. His . work inspired him to set up a charity, Reach For Rights. The auction . will fund its work providing a free legal service for those without the . means to seek help, including the disabled and victims of domestic . violence.

Then and now: Photographer Ray Bellisario is pictured in January 1963 (left) and three months ago (right). Bellisario used to infuriate Prince Philip . He says: ‘I am sad to be relinquishing my collection, much of which has not been seen in public before, but it is in aid of a cause about which I am passionate and will, I hope, live long after I am gone. 'Whoever buys it (my collection) will be securing a piece of history' Ray Bellisario . ‘For the past 40 years, it has been secretly moved from place to place. Whoever buys it will be securing a piece of history.’ Paul Fairweather, from auctioneers Omega, which is organising the sale, adds: ‘This is a truly remarkable collection and we expect there will be significant interest worldwide. It is such a unique collection, with nothing ever having come up for sale previously to compare it to. ‘We expect the collection to achieve somewhere in the region of between £500,000 and £1million.’ Omega Auctions is holding the sale in London on October 10, although private offers for the collection — which includes thousands of pictures of other public figures such as Winston Churchill, Brigitte Bardot and the Kennedy family — are also being invited.","Photographer Ray Bellisario puts 23,000-strong catalogue and its copyright up for auction for charity .

"By . Amanda Williams . Becky Bell, 7, from Hartlepool, who died of brain cancer. Her parents have been told they will have to pay £650 a year to keep her untouched bedroom . The parents of a young cancer victim have been told they will have to pay more than £650 a year to keep her untouched bedroom when charges for under-occupied homes come into force. The ashes of seven-year-old Becky Bell have been kept in her bedroom, which has been left exactly as it was when she lost her battle with brain cancer in January 2012. But Becky's parents, Julie and Mark, were told the room at their home in Hartlepool was now classed as a 'spare' and that they must pay £56 a month from April. Mrs Bell, 41, said: 'It doesn't bear to think about them calling it a spare room, it's Becky's room. 'It's not her fault she's not here anymore and to us she is still here. 'We don't want to be different to anyone else and some people may think a year is a long time but when you have been through what we have been through it isn't and we are still grieving. 'But the Government don't see that, they don't look at individual circumstances, all they see is the pound signs.' Under the changes, both social housing tenants in employment and those in receipt of housing benefit will be affected by the bedroom tax if they are found to be under-occupying their homes. From April households under-occupancy will see their benefits slashed by around £13 a week for one bedroom or £22 for two bedrooms. Mrs Bell, who is currently out of work, and Mr Bell, 37, a part-time taxi driver are Housing Hartlepool tenants and receive around £40 a week in housing benefits. With the introduction of the bedroom tax they will need to pay £672 a year for Becky's room. Becky's parents visited their local MP Iain Wright to appeal for help. Mr Wright described the circumstances as 'heartbreaking' and has sent a letter to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Iain Duncan Smith, expressing his dismay at the situation. Mrs Bell, who is also a mother to Vicki, 24, and Mark, 12, added: 'It's not the money that's the issue. 'If we did have a spare room we would be more than happy to pay the money.

'In our house we don't have a spare room, it's Becky's bedroom, everything is still there exactly how it was. 'We are not asking for the world but even if we were allowed another year to grieve. At this moment in time we are still grieving. 'But the Government don't think about the fact that every family is different. 'No two houses are the same but they don't look at that, they just think of the money.' Hartlepool Housing said it was a unique and difficult case. A spokesman added: 'We are very sad at the terrible bereavement that Julie and Mark suffered with the loss of Becky last year. 'We have recently been informing all tenants about the Government’s policy to reduce housing benefit to tenants with spare rooms. We have set up an advice service to discuss individual cases. 'The reforms have not yet been implemented and we finalising our proposals for a transitional discretionary fund which could be used in cases like this. 'There will be a number of cases in which the administrative body, the local authority, will look at individual circumstances and apply the reforms appropriately. We will work with Mr and Mrs Bell to ensure they receive the best advice and support.'","Ashes of Becky Bell have .

"By . Annabel Cole . Wimbledon might be the sporting event of the British summer season but this year’s tournament has so far failed to serve any surprises. But there has been one attraction causing a stir amongst female tennis fans: Kim Sears’s hair. Andy Murray’s 26-year-old girlfriend may cut a reserved — some might even say dull — figure in the stands, but her lustrous, sun-kissed locks have become a Wimbledon star in their own right. Grand slam: The Kim cut proved a big hit with Annabel (left) as a change from her natural auburn hair. Kim Sears, the first lady of Wimbledon applauding boyfriend Andy Murray earlier this week (right) Before: Annabel's natural auburn hair. Her hair transformation started in Vixen & Blush, a salon specialising in hair extensions in London's trendy Hoxton . The so-called ‘Kim cut’ — a soft cascade of glossy, caramel-hued tresses — has inspired such awe and admiration that a top London hair salon is currently offering wannabe tennis Wags the chance to recreate Kim’s signature look. As a 42-year-old mum whose chin-length bob is as flat as Centre Court, this offer is irresistible. Admittedly, the Kim makeover costs an eye-watering £1,000 — enough to make a dent in even a champion’s prize money — but if it can transform my hair into a head-turning Wimbledon winner, surely it’s worth it? I head to Vixen & Blush, a salon specialising in hair extensions in London’s trendy Hoxton. While it’s thought Kim’s hair is all her own, I’m going to need to cheat a little. There I meet owner Sarah McKenna, 31, and expert colourist Sussan Gilbert, 28, who will mastermind the whole process. The salon has a growing female client-base happy to spend, on average, a staggering £500 on extensions per visit, rather more than the £50 my appointments usually cost. Glossy: Kim Sears at Wimbledon earlier this week. To recreate Kim's mane, Annabel needed a full head of 22-inch extensions. That's two-and-a-half ponytails' worth, costing around £700 . No synthetic glued-on horrors here; the extensions used are made from the highest quality real hair, which is blended to match the customer’s own tones. The salon’s technique is so popular that it gets through 25kg of hair every six weeks. Sarah explains that achieving Kim’s look will involve two stages; first lightening my natural auburn to recreate her ones, then adding extensions for the swooshy length. I have to admit that despite being thrilled about the possibility of achieving Kim’s celebrated coiffure, I am filled with trepidation. My locks may be lacklustre, but they are untreated — what Sarah calls ‘virgin hair’ — and consequently undamaged. I worry my makeover will do serious harm, though I’m reassured that a one-off will be fine. Sussan inspects a picture of Kim at Wimbledon this week and observes: ‘Her look is very glamorous but also natural — almost as if she got her colour by sitting in the stands.’ Radiant: Kim Sears' sleek hair looks glamorous, but natural. Annabel's natural colour was 'lifted' a multitude of fine highlights, using a low peroxide tint that lightens her hair while keeping it soft . I wonder if I have any hope of achieving this effect with my reddy-brown strands, but Sussan, a colourist with ten years’ experience, has a plan. She will ‘lift’ my natural colour with a multitude of fine highlights, using a low peroxide tint that will lighten my hair while keeping the texture soft and natural. Producing three shades of permanent colour — mid blonde ash, dark blonde ash and honey blonde — Sussan proceeds to take tiny sections of hair, painting each with a single colour. The strands are then wrapped in foil and left to develop. Sussan puts more than 80 foils in my hair — what’s called a three-quarter head of highlights. An hour-and-a-half later she completes the procedure with ‘balayage’ — colour painted on to the tips to accentuate them, which she assures me will flatter the contours of my face. The colour is then left on for a further 35 minutes. Sleek: Kim Sears at Wimbledon earlier this week. The hair stylist Sarah worked for four hours fitting more than 250 extensions to give Annabel Kim's thick locks . When my hair has been washed and rough-dried I am pleasantly surprised. The colour isn’t the dramatic departure I had feared. It is, however, noticeably lighter, almost as if I had just returned from a long summer holiday or, indeed, a few weeks watching tennis under sunny skies. Sarah now takes over to add the extensions. The hair the salon uses arrives in thick ponytails, in a huge variety of natural shades. The ponytails come in lengths of 14 to 22 inches (the most popular is the 18-inch ‘boob’ length) and cost £150 to £250 from her supplier. To recreate Kim’s mane, I will need a full head of 22-inch extensions. That’s two-and-a-half ponytails’ worth, costing around £700. Sarah expertly selects hair from four ponytails: light blonde, light ash, dark ash and golden. She brushes the strands together and holds them up to my hair. To my astonishment, the shades are almost identical. To create extensions, small strands are taken and bonded with keratin resin — a brown glue-like substance — at one end to form ‘tips’ like the ends of a shoelace. Coveted: Kim Sears' hair. The final step of Annabel's makeover is to have her new head of hair is washed and blow-dried to give it Kim's signature va-va-voom . Sarah works for four hours fitting more than 250 extensions — it’s a long process. As the locks begin to tumble over my shoulders, I give a toss of my head. Three people stand back to make way for my flying tresses. I begin to get a sense of what power hair can do. Once it’s complete, I look in the mirror. But my heart sinks; instead of a tennis princess, I look like an ageing schoolgirl badly in need of a haircut. But it’s now that Danielle, another hairdresser, takes over to trim the shapeless extensions into soft layers. At the same time my own hair is cut so it blends as smoothly as possible. Finally my new head of hair is washed and blow-dried to give it Kim’s signature va-va-voom. My verdict: I am stunned. Swishing it from side to side my hair is soft and lustrous and, having avoided colour for years, I am pleasantly surprised by the subtle yet distinctive result. But what will my family think? My son, Kit, sees me first. ‘You look weird,’ he tells me. But 15-year-old Elsa — my toughest critic — is surprisingly positive: ‘You look really young, mummy.’ Meanwhile, my husband, a man who doesn’t mince words, says he is impressed, although he comments that my voluminous tresses somewhat dwarf my 5ft 4in frame. I look like I might topple over. The best comes that evening when a friend pops in and says that he mistook me for a friend of Elsa’s. I’d love to believe him. So could I pass for radiant Kim? Well, no, I am still a middle-aged mother-of-three. But can I carry off her championship-winning hair? The answer, I think, is a resounding ‘yes’. Now all I need is a VIP pass for Centre Court.

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . A mother-of-one has spoken out about her experiences - good and bad - of being a surrogate for gay and infertile couples. Jessica Szalacinski, a 36-year-old language teacher based in Nashville, Tennessee, has been a surrogate twice; birthing a baby girl in 2009 and a boy in 2011, both for gay male couples - which were 'joyous' experiences. She was forced to walk away from her third surrogacy arrangement, however, after the 'rich, well-known' couple, led her to feel like 'a commodity', Ms Szalacinski tells Jane Ridley at The New York Post. Surrogate: Jessica Szalacinski, 36, (pictured) has readily given birth to two babies, both for gay couples, but walked out on a third arrangement because the couple led her to feel like a 'commodity' 'I definitely come from breeding stock, and pregnancy is a relatively easy process for me,' she says. 'I entered into the whole thing with my eyes open. Nobody forced me to do anything.' Ms Szalacinski, who has a 12-year-old son with her police officer husband, Eric, was first introduced to the concept when she saw a news report on the difficulties faced by gay couples wishing to adopt or foster children. Instead of 'picketing' for the cause, she decided to volunteer her womb for the purpose of surrogacy. Initially, her son was enraged because he assumed his mother would be 'having sex with two men', and her husband thought she was 'crazy', but once everything was explained and carefully considered, all parties were on board. Ms Szalacinski found David and Alex, a gay couple . based in New York, through Surromomsonline.com, and instantly 'clicked' with them, bonding not only over the baby she would later birth for them . - a result of David's sperm and Alex's sister's egg - but also their shared interests. Popular route: Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon and his wife Nancy (left) welcomed their daughter Winnie Rose (right) via a surrogate last July, after they failed to conceive naturally . Proud parents: Tom Ford (left) and his partner of 27 years, Richard Buckley (right) had their first son Alexander in 2012, also via a surrogate . Gestational surrogacy uses In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) to create an embryo using the eggs from the prospective mother or donor and sperm from the father or donor that is then implanted in a surrogate. This allows the intended parents to have a genetically related child. The success rate varies widely based on the quality of the egg and sperm, as well as the age and health of the surrogate. Gestational carriers are officially recognized in only 15 states and are illegal in some. '[I] preferred a gay couple for selfish reasons,' she reveals. 'A heterosexual couple is coming to a surrogate already crestfallen because they’ve tried and failed. 'Going forward, a lot of their sense will be wrapped up with those kind of emotions and possibly some envy and jealousy. But working with a gay couple is joyous.' Ms Szalacinski was paid $20,000 for the process, and underwent a 'full psychological' evaluation and a home visit', before giving birth to a healthy girl in Nashville, in 2009. In the delivery room, the baby was whisked away as quickly as possible, before any 'biological urge' could present itself. 'I did hear a cry,' she says. 'But it was like hearing the neighbor’s kid crying. I think it would have been harder for me if I hadn’t bonded with the dads.' Heartbreak: E! host Giuliana Rancic and her husband Bill (left) have one son, Duke (right) who was born via a surrogate two years ago, and earlier this month, the same surrogate tragically miscarried their second child . Success stories: Hunger games star Elizabeth Banks and her husband Max Handelman (left) have two children born via a surrogate, and Elton John has a four-year-old son, Zachary (seen right), with partner David Furnish . Ms Szalacinski agreed to be a surrogate for the second time, for Art and Matt, close friends of Alex and David, and gave birth to their son in 2011; another healthy and happy experience. In more recent times, she entered into a third arrangement, this time with a 'well known' and 'mega rich' couple from the entertainment industry, who she can't name for legal reasons - and who were due to pay her a 'significantly higher' fee than she had been offered previously. 'It was like hearing the neighbor’s kid crying. I think it would have been harder for me if I hadn’t bonded with the dads' Unlike with the first two couples, she found it impossible to 'bond' with these people, who treated the process like 'a business transaction'; so much so that Ms Szalacinski started referring to herself as a 'commodity.' Not only . were the couple initially insistent on having a boy - testing the embryos . five days after fertilization for gender - but when they eventually . settled on two female embryos, they asked Ms Szalacinski to 'reduce', or terminate, one of them if they both 'took,' because they didn't want to raise twins. Growing family: Sarah Jessica Parker (left) and Matthew Broderick (right) have one biological son, James (center) and twin girls, Marion and Tabitha (pictured), who were born via a surrogate in 2009 . Happy family: Nicole Kidman and husband Keith Urban (pictured) had daughter Sunday Rose naturally (right) and Faith (left) via a surrogate . Additionally, the picky couple were eager to choose a 'particularly attractive' egg donor, despite the fact that her eggs were 'sub-par', because, according to Ms Szalacinski, they were 'obsessed with looks.' 'I couldn’t believe that this kind of misogyny exists. My moral compass kept flicking off and I had to walk away,' she says. Although her experience with this couple was a blot on her otherwise successful track record, Ms Szalacinski says she still feels 'incredibly' happy about the children she was able to provide the four prior dads. Her decision to undergo this journey echoes the increasing popularity of the practice. While wealthy American couples have been enlisting the services of surrogates in developing countries such as India and parts of Africa for some time now, surrogacy in the U.S. is becoming more common. According to the Council for Responsible Genetics, the number of children born to gestational surrogates - carriers that bear no genetic link to the child they carry - more than doubled between 2004 and 2008, with just over 5,000 babies estimated to have been born via this delivery during that time period. 'I couldn’t believe that this kind of misogyny exists. My moral compass kept flicking off and I had to walk away' And in 2012 alone, 1,898 babies were born via a gestational surrogate, according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. Surrogate mothers can expect to make an average of between $12,000 and $25,000 for the service - much more in some cases - but laws around 'commercial surrogacy' vary widely according to state. States which are most surrogacy friendly include California and New Jersey - where the highest number of surrogacy births occur - as well as Illinois, Arkansas and Maryland. Commercial surrogacy in New York is illegal, and Michigan, for example, forbids absolutely all surrogacy agreements. Surrogacy has proven to be a popular route for wealthy couples and celebrities in the U.S. Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon and his wife Nancy were the most recent to welcome a child, a daughter Winnie Rose, via surrogacy last July. Designer Tom Ford and his partner Richard Buckley had their first child, a son called Alexander, in 2012, and other notable stars to have taken this road include Hunger games star Elizabeth Banks and her husband Max, E! host Giuliana Rancic and husband Bill, actress Nicole Kidman and husband Keith Urban, Elton John and his partner David Furnish, Sarah Jessica Parker and husband Matthew Broderick, as well as Robert de Niro, Kelsey Grammar and Ricky Martin.","Jessica Szalacinski, 36, has had two 'joyous' experiences with surrogacy, and one which she had to 'walk away' from .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Changing your own appearance in post-production, be it via Photoshop or an array of filters, is becoming more commonplace. But users will soon be able to edit what they look like in real time, thanks to a new app set to be released for iOS and Android later this year. Called Looksery, it uses tracking technology to change the user's face live on the screen, whether it’s during a video call, or when taking a picture. Scroll down for video . Looksery is a new app set for release later this year on iOS (August) and Android (November) that enables you to change your appearance on the go. Using some high-tech facial tracking technology, the app can alter your appearance, from changing the colour of your eyes to turning you into a zombie . The team behind the app are currently seeking funding on Kickstarter to ensure it arrives on iOS in August and Android by November. 'We have developed our own code for video face tracking, and designed unique video filters which work in real-time,' the team wrote on Kickstarter. 'The Looksery app is programmed using C++, GLSL and ASM and we use some of the features of the OpenCV library. 'Our tracking and initialization algorithms are based on the Active Appearance Model. 'Currently we have five patents pending, involving real-time face-tracking and the technology that modifies it. 'The app has a user friendly interface and you can change your appearance with just a singe tap.' Aside from the aforementioned features, the app has a ‘simple interface’ and social media sharing options. It is even able to track and alter a face when there are multiple people in the shot. To use the app, a user opens the app and points the camera at themselves. The face tracking software then builds a mapped ‘model’ of that person’s appearance. Along the bottom of the app there are 16 filters that can be applied to change the look of someone. These range from ‘zombifying’ a person, to making them appear thinner. Within the app the user can take an edited picture of themselves and send it to others. They can also take a video or make a live video call, altering their appearance on-the-go. Additionally, there is a chat feature included, which lets people send images and videos to each other alongside text. ‘The technology that drives Looksery was built from scratch by our team,’ the company wrote. ‘We are the first company to bring the full power of such complex face-tracking technology to mobile. ‘This . means you can now do so much more than just adding a few generic . pictures or animations to your media; it is the ability to completely . modify your appearance and exchange video messages as 3D characters. ‘With Looksery you can explore different filters that change entirely the way you look and enhance videos.’ There are 16 filters available that can be used to alter your face. There are several ways the app can be used, including taking a picture and sharing it with friends or making a live video call and changing your face as you talking. The app can also pick out one face from a crowd of many . Making yourself look like a zombie is perhaps one of the scarier features of the app, and the effect is seemingly quite real. Some of the other effects include making your face appear as an x-ray, turning yourself into a 3D animated bear, changing your neck shape and more .","A San Francisco-based company has unveiled their new Looksery app .

"By . Chloe Lambert . Peter Cross experienced post-traumatic stress disorder after staying on an intensive care unit . Peter . Cross knew it would take time to recover after major cancer surgery. Doctors had found cancerous cells in his oesophagus, or gullet, and . planned to remove it and reattach his stomach to his throat. Peter . would spend at least a week in hospital, including a stint in intensive . care. Full recovery could take a year and his digestion would be . permanently affected. 'I . approached the operation with some trepidation,' says Peter, a father of . five, who works with children with autism. 'But I still saw it as a . cure.' Although Peter, 61, . prepared himself for the physical aftermath, he never dreamed the . experience in February last year would affect his mental health. However, . as a result of his time in intensive care, he developed post-traumatic . stress disorder and depression, from which - more than a year later - he . is only just starting to recover. Astonishingly, . every year up to 50,000 people in Britain suffer the same experience . after a stay in intensive care, also known as critical care. Patients . are moved to these wards during major illness, or after injury or . surgery, and are placed on specialised monitoring equipment, with one . highly trained nurse per patient. To . help recovery, these patients are often put on organ support - for . example, breathing through a ventilator - and may have drips and lines . attached. The majority are also given powerful sedating drugs to reduce . pain and make them more comfortable, aiding their recovery. But . these medications can cause disturbing hallucinations and delusions. When combined with major surgery or illness and perhaps coming close to . death, this can leave people with a degree of trauma similar to that . seen in those returning from a battlefield, say experts. Often, . patients are simply not prepared for these delusions, and have been . known to become violent or even call the police from their hospital bed. When Peter came round after . his surgery at University College London Hospital (UCLH), he was . completely unprepared for what he saw and heard. 'The . first thing I was aware of was seeing colours and shapes - like a . psychedelic painting but on a grand scale,' says Peter, who lives with . his wife, Patsy, in Reading. 'But this was minor compared with other . images I was having.' Peter . was convinced he'd been taken to Eastern Europe to be questioned for . information and the hospital ward had been recreated there to fool him. He even thought his wife and son were imposters. 'I asked Patsy to show . me her hysterectomy scar, and to see my son's bank card, thinking that . would catch them out,' he says. 'Patsy found it very upsetting, particularly because no one explained this was common.' He was being treated at University College London Hospital last year and still suffers some flashbacks . The . plan was for Peter to spend three days on intensive care after surgery, . but he caught pneumonia and had to stay for a further seven days. He . was put on a ventilator, as well as having drips and lines inserted. He . was also given painkilling and sedating drugs. His . delusions continued day and night. As well as his Eastern European . dramas, Peter hallucinated about going to a hospital talk about assisted . suicide, and saw other patients take their own lives or be helped to . die by the doctors and nurses with lethal injections. In reality, he was bed-bound and heavily sedated. When . doctors reduced the sedation, Peter woke up but the hallucinations . continued. 'I could see people throwing themselves off the top of a . canyon and hear the thuds of the bodies. These images are still with me. I didn't dare talk to the medical staff - in my mind they were all . enemies.' At one point, though he doesn't remember it, he told his wife he was going to commit suicide.After . ten days, Peter was moved to a high dependency ward (one level below . intensive care). Two weeks later, he was finally allowed to go home. He . was now just on paracetamol, but was still haunted by hallucinations. 'I . was starting to realise these things could not have happened. But I . still got flashbacks every day,' he says. 'I felt very depressed and . started wondering if I was going mad.' Doctors . have long known that intensive care can traumatise patients. However, a . 2012 study at UCLH found the problem may be far more common than . thought. 'More than half of . patients in the study who had been on intensive care suffered clinical . depression, anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder,' says Dr Dorothy . Wade, a psychologist at the hospital. This would equate to 50,000 . patients nationwide every year. 'For some people this distress will fade . with time, but there are studies showing the problem continues at 12 . months,' adds Dr Wade. 'One . study showed that, at two years, 40 per cent of patients had clinical . depression. I've encountered people having terrible flashbacks and . nightmares ten years later.' The . drugs given to intensive care patients are similar to those used to put . a patient to sleep for surgery. But they are administered for longer . periods, and as the patient's organs may not be functioning properly, . they are not broken down and stay in the body, leading to delusions. Dr . Wade's study found patients who received benzodiazepines - a class of . tranquilliser drug that includes Valium - were at high risk of . psychological problems. Patients who suffered a high level of distress . in intensive care and those with a history of depression or anxiety . suffer more, too. The trauma . can be debilitating, affecting work, relationships and family life; some . patients require therapy and antidepressants. Dr . David Howell, clinical director of critical care at UCLH, says: 'If you . come through intensive care, people say you're lucky to be alive. But . patients don't see it that way if they are experiencing daily troubling . flashbacks. Intensive care teams are minimising use of sedative drugs because of their psychological consequences . 'Many say the . psychological problems are worse than the physical illness they had to . start with. We have patients who won't go through further planned . surgery because they can't face more trauma.' UCLH . is one of a minority of hospitals that offer an appointment with a . psychologist to post-intensive care patients who have had a long stay. Peter Cross was invited to such a session last August last, six months . after his operation. 'They . said I had borderline post-traumatic stress disorder and borderline . depression,' he recalls. 'They explained this was a common problem and . was the result of the drugs I'd been given. Once I saw it was a normal . thing, and understood the cause, things got easier.' He . was also invited to have a tour of the intensive care ward. 'It helped . put things in place because it was very different from my memories of . the ward.' Peter was offered counselling but decided with his doctors that it was not necessary. Intensive care teams are now moving towards minimising the use of sedative drugs because of their psychological consequences. Dr . Wade and Dr Howell are taking part in a £2 million study in 24 . intensive care units to test ways of stopping psychological problems. Staff . will be trained in 'psychological first-aid' - learning to talk to . patients in a calming way to reduce trauma and help them understand why . they are having delusions. Patients with extreme stress will also have . cognitive behavioural therapy on the ward. Peter . Cross is now doing well and is back at work part-time. But he thinks . the UCLH trial is urgently needed. 'A little bit of forewarning would . have helped. It wouldn't have stopped it happening, but I would have . been able to put it into context a bit quicker.'","Peter Cross, 61, spend time in hospital recovering after major surgery .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Vladimir Putin has insisted he is 'not prejudiced in any way', and that he has some gay friends, amid an outcry against Russia's laws against gay 'propaganda'. He also made efforts to praise the 'personal achievements' of gay celebrities such as Elton John, whom he called 'extraordinary'. But the Russian leader also linked gay people to paedophiles, who are covered jointly in the controversial propaganda law, ahead of the Sochi Winter Olympics, which start next month. 'Not prejudiced': Russian president Vladimir Putin, left, said that he was uninterested in a person's sexuality in an interview today. He made efforts to praise gay celebrities, such as the 'extraordinary' Elton John, right . Despite reassuring visitors the laws present 'no danger' to them, the Russian leader still suggested there was a need . to 'clean up' homosexuality in Russian order to drive up the country's . birth rate, and defended the country's right to pass such a law. In an interview broadcast amid international outrage ahead of the Sochi Winter Olympics, he said: 'Read our law carefully – it’s called ""a . ban on the propaganda of paedophilia and homosexuality"". But this is nothing to do with persecuting . invididuals for their sexual orientation.' 'It seems to me that the law we adopted doesn’t . harm anybody. What’s more, homosexual people can’t feel inferior here . because there is no professional career or social discrimination against . them. 'When they achieve great success [they are honoured] – for example Elton John is a . extraordinary person, a distinguished musician, and millions of our . people sincerely love him, regardless of his sexual orientation.' In a segment later broadcast on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, the president dodged a question on whether gay people are born or made. But he did tell Andrew Marr: 'If you want my personal attitude, I would tell you that I don’t care about a person’s sexual orientation.

'I myself know some people who are gay – we are on friendly terms. I am not prejudiced in any way.' Mr Putin also made efforts to assure athletes and sports fans visiting the Sochi Winter Olympics that the new propaganda laws present 'no danger' to them. The games, which start on 7 February, have cost more than £30billion, making them the most expensive in Olympic history. The Russian government hopes to show the world a modern face of Russia, which has faced increased criticism from the West over human rights.

He has been involved with the Cavalier Rescue for years,' said Davis. Sturgeon loves his dogs and rumor has it he will one day leave his $75 million dollar estate to the pooches . Ron Sturgeon is a self-made millionaire who began his career by opening an auto salvage business when he was fresh out of high school in 1978. The business, which he started when when his dad died and left him homeless and along, eventually grew into the largest of its kind in the United States. He sold his chain of auto salvage yards to Ford in 1999 for upwards of $20 million before buying it back from the car company for a profit years later. Sturgeon soon sold the business that made him a millioanire once again, this time for $23.5 million. In between these deals, he worked for Ford and started a successful auto auction for insurers, which won him even more millions. Now in his 60s, Sturgeon collects toy and adult-sized cars. He displays many of his 3,000 toys at one of his Texas offices. As of 2010, he owned 14 cars that included Bentleys and Ferreris, according to Dallas News. In 2013, Sturgeon published a sex and relationship advice book called Men are Pigs: And that's a good thing in which he describes how he applies his keen business sense to women in order to become a 'sex whisperer.'

Mr Miliband hopes to use a series visits across the country to connect with voters ahead of local and European elections tomorrow . Being seen to eat a bacon sandwich at New Covent Garden Market probably seemed like a good idea, but the pictures tell a different story . After settling down at a nearby table, Mr Miliband did not look like he was enjoying his toasted buttie. A number of photographs showed the Labour leader pulling a series of contorted faces. His struggle to appear in touch with ordinary people suffered a fresh setback after it emerged he regularly spends £2.25 on an artisan loaf of bread from a deli near his North London home. Mr Miliband hopes to draw a line under interest in his own spending with a new focus on Labour policies ahead of local and European Parliament elections tomorrow. Polls suggest Ukip will win the European Parliament elections, pushing Labour into second place and the Tories in third. Local elections are also being held in England, with 4,216 seats and 161 councils at stake. He embarked on a 10 visits - taking him from London to his Doncaster constituency via towns in the South East, East of England, East Midlands and Yorkshire & Humberside. It began with an early morning visit to New Covent Garden Market, where he bought a bunch of red roses for wife Justine and chatted with traders. Mr Miliband then posed for the cameras as he bought a bacon sandwich from cafe owner Antonios Foufas. But the visit did nothing to win over the local businessman. 'I find the Conservatives are more pro-business,' Mr Foufas told the Standard.

Labour leader Ed Miliband buys a bacon sandwich from cafe owner Antonios Foufas at New Covent Garden Market in London as he kicks off a day of campaigning on the eve of the local and European elections . In a blow to the Labour leader, Mr Foufas later revealed that he is backing the Conservatives . It was an inauspicious start to the day after suffering not one but two PR blunders yesterday. He was accused of being 'out of touch with reality' after claiming to spend just £70 or £80-a-week on shopping bills, when the average for a family of four is well over £100. He suffered further humiliation in a subsequent radio interview because he did not know the name of the Labour party leader at a battleground council. His blunders were seized on by the Tories, who accused him of being a ‘champagne socialist’. The interviews made for a day of woe . for Mr Miliband as voters prepare to go to the polls tomorrow for . European and local council elections. The trip to the market at 6.30am was the first stop on a tour of 10 areas designed to highlight Labour policies . Mr Miliband has been under pressure after two polls last week put the Tories ahead for the first time in two years.

The Labour leader posted this picture of himself on Twitter, joking that he was on his second visit and third cup of tea . Ed Miliband was pictured leaving a newly-built council estate in Lincoln earlier today. The visit was part of his mammoth 10-stop campaign tour of the country ahead of tomorrow's elections . The Labour leader has campaigned for 200,000 new homes to be built every year to tackle run-away house prices preventing ordinary families from owning their own place . Ed Miliband met construction workers building new council houses in Lincoln. The Labour leader has suffered a tough two days campaigning ahead of tomorrow's crunch election . He has been under pressure after two polls last week put the Tories ahead for the first time in two years. The Labour leader said: 'If I have heard one message most of all in this campaign, it is the depths of discontent about the way the country is run. 'The challenges go beyond this Government. And people are asking whether any political party can turn it round? 'Can anyone rebuild the link between a hard day's work and ordinary family finances? 'That link that used to be the foundation of our country's prosperity. That used to guarantee the people of this country a decent life for them and their families. 'My answer is that Labour can and Labour will. People should vote Labour on Thursday to make Britain better than this. Vote Labour to make your family better off.'","Labour leader visits New Covent Garden Market at start of 10-stop tour .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . A Swiss designer has created a silk scarf which very closely resembles a meaty rasher of bacon. Entitled, the Fou Lard, its name plays on the French term for a thin scarf or handkerchief, 'Foulard', and also the French for bacon, which is simply: 'Lard'. Digitally printed on delicate silk, the hyper-realistic bacon scarf - not cheap at $165 - is admittedly a mouth-watering thing to behold, with detail all the way down to its 'crispy' black rolled hem. Introducing the Fou Lard: Swiss designer Natalie Luder designed this unusual silk scarf, which is digitally printed and costs $165 . The scarf's designer, Natalie Luder, writes on her website: 'My work is often inspired by topics of the realm of food culture. The comparison of appearance and reality, nature and culture, as well as the discussion about good and bad taste are fascinating aspects to me.' A quick glance through some of her other projects reveals a rather morbid fixation with dead animals. A necklace hung with moths, another made from 'horse teeth' and the ceramic recreation of an edible organ for example. Bacon style: The 100 per cent silk scarf appears to be keeping this woman nice and warm as she poses in arctic conditions . Almost edible: Even the blackened 'crispy' edges of the rolled hem closely resembles a delicious rasher of bacon . Swanky: Ms Luder released a limited number of the scarves in 2011, but they are yet to sell out . Bacon lover: Supermodel Cara Delevingne (pictured) has enjoyed a very public love affair with her favorite meaty snack, even tweeting herself in her very own pair of bacon-themed socks (left) Describing her unusual fares, Ms Luder writes: 'The wearer overtakes the qualities of the slaid animal and blazons himself with the heroic hunting story[sic].' You might assume the Fou Lard to be a fast-food fashion anomaly, but there appears to exist something of a bacon-themed clothing sub-culture in today's America. BaconFreak.com sells an entire line of bacon-inspired clothing. And supermodel of the moment Cara Delevingne regularly sings the praises of her favorite meaty snack, even joyously acquiring a pair of bacon-decorated socks for herself not too long ago. The Fou Lard was first issued by Ms Luder as a limited edition item in 2011, however, they are yet to sell out.",The 'Fou Lard' scarf is 100 per cent silk and retails for $165 .
"By . Rachel Reilly . Within weeks of returning home from Africa, Catherine Stewart felt something wriggling in her stomach . A British woman returned from doing charity work in Africa to find flesh-eating maggots living - and wriggling - in her stomach. Catherine Stewart, 28, from Liverpool, visited The Gambia to better understand how the charity she worked for in the UK was helping the West African country's inhabitants. When she returned to the UK and discovered several bites on her body she wasn't worried - but as one turned yellow she thought she should investigate it further. Squeezing the lesion revealed she was infested with the larvae of the tumbu fly which gorge on human flesh. 'There were just a few red circles that looked like bites [when I was in The Gambia], but when I got home I found more,' she said. 'When I found a yellow one on my stomach I just thought it was just a small infected bite with pus and thought squeezing it might help,' 'But as I squeezed I felt something pull back [into the skin]. I immediately thought there was something wrong.' Catherine immediately called her husband Paul and asked him to help. 'I called for him to grab some tweezers . and then asked him if he could pull out whatever it was that was moving . under my skin if I squeezed.' Paul then pulled out a large maggot. 'I started screaming and saying ""No, no, . please tell me it's not a maggot!"". Paul then looked at me and said ""I . think we need to go to hospital"",' she recalled. Scroll down for video... Catherine immersed herself in the African working holiday and wasn't aware of the dangers lurking in damp towels. Experts say that to prevent being infested it is important to tumble dry or iron wet clothes when in the tropics to kill tumba fly eggs . Catherine left) picked up the maggots when she visited the Gambia to better understand how the charity she worked for was benefiting the West African country's inhabitants . Catherine discovered she was infested when she asked her husband, Paul, to use a tweezers to pull out what was wriggling in her abdomen (CGI pictured). Paul immediately took her to hospital . The tumbu fly is found across the tropics and can cause a condition called myiasis, when the . larvae feed on a host. The . female tumbu fly lays its eggs on damp clothing or towels. If . damp fabrics come into contact with human skin, the eggs penetrate . the skin. To prevent catching the larvae, clothes should be  tumble-dried or, if they are left to dry outside, ironed, as the heat kills the eggs. After two or three days, the larvae hatch beneath the skin. Once . born, the larvae need air to breathe so they eat their way out of their host. This . can cause significant pain and irritation to the surrounding tissue. It . is well-documented that people become . infested - Youtube is full of cilps - with tumbu maggots while abroad and many try to remove them by squeezing. But this can be dangerous as the maggot can split in half and rot underneath the skin triggering an infection . Instead, . the best way to get rid of the maggots is to cover the wound with . Vaseline. This cuts off the maggot's air supply causes it to surface. Before they sought medical help Paul and Catherine managed to pull out a further six maggots. Catherine's ordeal features in a new Discovery Channel documentary, called 'Bugs, Bites and Parasites' that follows the work of specialists who are faced with patients exhibiting a variety of mysterious symptoms - more often than not from people who have travelled abroad. Catherine visited Liverpool Royal University Hospital's School of Tropical Medicine, a world leader in the field of mysterious illnesses. In the programme Catherine presents the maggots in a small bottle for specialist registrar Dr Helen Winslow to analyse. Grimly, they are still alive and writhing. Further inspection reveals that they are in fact tumbu larvae, flesh-eating maggots that burrow under a person's skin to feast on flesh. The female tumbu fly lays its eggs on damp clothing or towels. If damp fabrics come into contact with human skin, then the eggs penetrate the skin. Doctors advise that to prevent catching the larvae, clothes should be  tumble-dried or, if they are left to dry outside, ironed, as the heat kills the eggs. After two or three days, the larvae hatch beneath the skin. Once born, the larvae need air to . breathe so they eat their way out of their host. This can cause . significant pain and irritation to the surrounding tissue. Paul and Catherine managed to extract six maggots - which can grow up to one cm long - before they arrived at the Liverpool Royal's University Hospital where they presented their findings to specialist registrar Dr Helen Winslow . The small wounds can be come incredibly painful as the maggots gorge on flesh to reach the surface where they can breathe more easily and grow into mature flies . For Catherine it took 15 minutes for Dr Winslow to remove a further eight maggots from her body - bringing Catherine's total maggot count to 14. It is well-documented - Youtube is full of clips - that people become infested with tumbu maggots and many try to remove them by squeezing them out, much like an infected spot. But this can split the maggot in half and trigger an infection. The female tumbu fly lays its eggs on damp clothing or towels. If damp fabrics come into contact with human skin, then the eggs penetrate the skin and hatch into larvae (CGI pictured) that feast on flesh . Instead, the best way to get rid of the maggots is to cover the wound with Vaseline. This cuts off the maggot's air supply and forces it to come to the surface for oxygen. After Dr Winslow's examination and extractions, Catherine is ordered to carry out a daily body check each morning for a week. By the end of the week Catherine is given the all-clear and says that she is already planning another trip to the same area. 'The charity work I do is very important and nothing - not even flesh-eating tumbu flies - is going to stop me from doing it,' she said.","Catherine Stewart, from Liverpool, returned from doing charity work in Africa with what looked like several, harmless bites .

"By . Jaya Narain . William Roache was described as a ‘cockroach with a capital C’ by a Coronation Street co-star, a court heard yesterday. One of Roache’s alleged sex assault victims said Peter Adamson, who played Len Fairclough in the soap, warned her: ‘You want to keep your eye on him, he will lead you astray.’ Roache, 81, of Wilmslow, Cheshire, who has appeared as Ken Barlow in the ITV1 soap since its launch, denies two counts of rape and five counts of indecent assault involving five complainants aged 16 and under on dates between 1965 and 1971. Scroll down for video . On trial:  Coronation Street actor Bill Roache (3rd left) arrives at Preston Crown Court with sons James (left), Linus (2nd left) and daughter Verity today . The alleged victim, who was around 14 . at the time and said Roache indecently assaulted her in his dressing . room, told the court she was touring the Granada Studios in Manchester . when Adamson, who died in 2002, made the accusation. She . said: ‘It was Len Fairclough that made the comment because when he said . it, he looked directly at him and he looked at us, and said: “You want . to keep your eye on him, he will lead you astray”. He called him a . cockroach with a capital C.' She told the jury at Preston Crown Court . last week that Roache groped her in a room after being led past the . Rovers Return pub on the set. 'It's easy for you to sit there and judge, but . you wasn't (sic) in that room. He abused me whether he likes it or not. He assaulted me and I had to carry it round with me. Can . you imagine what would have happened to me if I'd gone to the police as . a child. He's a dirty b******, he tried it on with me' - Alleged victim to Roache's barrister . The . court heard that the alleged victim and her sister would sit on the . steps outside the studio in the summer holidays in the mid to late . 1960s, along with other girls and boys who were autograph-hunting. But . on one occasion after being invited inside the studios, Roache, who has . played Ken Barlow in the ITV soap for more than 50 years, took her to . his dressing room and indecently assaulted her by putting his hands on . her breasts and up her skirt. She told police: 'He was like an octopus - hands everywhere.' In a video interview played to the court . on Friday the woman said it was Johnny Briggs, who played Mike Baldwin in the series, who warned her about Roache. The . witness agreed yesterday that at first she told police the 'cockroach' remark about Roache had been made by the actor who plays the character . Mike Baldwin, but said she later corrected herself when she realised it . was Peter Adamson, who played Len Fairclough. Challenged . about her account by Louise Blackwell QC, defending, the witness told . the court: ‘I’m telling the truth. Why the hell would I put myself . through all of this?’ She . went on: 'I am confused with all the dates. I'm here as a witness to . witness what happened in that room. If I had known what I was going to . go though, I wouldn't have come forward. 'I . feel like I'm on trial here. It's Mr Barlow, Ken Barlow, who has done . it, not me. The issue is what he did to me. I'm sorry, but, as a victim, . I'm so sorry that I ever come forward.' Distressed, . she told the barrister: 'It's easy for you to sit there and judge, but . you wasn't (sic) in that room. He abused me whether he likes it or not. He assaulted me and I had to carry it round with me. 'Can . you imagine what would have happened to me if I'd gone to the police as . a child. He's a dirty b******, he tried it on with me'. Her husband told the court he recalled his wife telling him about the alleged assault about two years into their marriage. Allegations: One of Roache's alleged victims said that Coronation Street actor Peter Adamson, who played Len Fairclough, right, warned her that the star was a 'cockroach' and would lead her 'astray', the court heard . The witness was asked by Miss Blackwell about press interest in her story and reporters visiting her house. She said her sister had 'two visits from the Mirror' and had been offered £25,000 for her story. The . witness added she was visited once by a reporter from The Sun, but the . only money mentioned was a donation of an undisclosed amount to a . charity. 'I know what's going through your mind,' she told Miss Blackwell, 'and it's not going to happen, because I did not want money.' She . added: 'If I wanted money I could've sold my story but I have not sold . my story. I have spoken to nobody except those who should know.' The court also heard Roache made a girl carry out a sex act on him as . he drove his Rolls-Royce and then dropped her on the street saying: . `There's half a crown, get the bus back'. The . alleged incident happened after the girl and a close friend had . travelled to Manchester to visit the Coronation Street studios. But as they were about to leave she said the actor walked up to her and asked `Would you like a lift home?' In a video interview played to the . court she said: 'I thought ""Well, I'm with my friend, it should be okay."" We said yes. He had a gold Silver Cloud Rolls-Royce. I said where we . were going and he said 'Oh, I'm going that way'. 'I . said `We'll get in the back, but he said to me `No, you go in the . front`. We set off and everything was fine. We got into the main road, . in the mainstream traffic.' Evidence: The woman first claimed in a police video shown in court that Johnny Briggs, . (right in 1974) who played Mike Baldwin, warned her . to 'watch' William Roache (left in 1961), but she corrected it today . She . said the actor didn't speak to her but began fumbling around and then . grasped her hand and placed it on his crotch. She said she began to . perform a sex act on him until they came to a road junction and a double . decker bus pulled up alongside the car. 'We . came to a junction,' she said. 'We were on the inside and there was a . double decker bus next to us. I pulled my hand away but he put it back.' She said she hadn't looked at him at all while performing the sex act . and when it was over he said he would drop them off. She said: 'He said `I'll have to drop you off here`. He said `There's half a crown, get the bus back`. Roache, 81, of Wilmslow, Cheshire, denies . two counts of rapes and five counts of indecent assault involving five . complainants aged 16 and under on dates between 1965 and 1971.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . The mysterious strands of dark matter that hide beneath the visible universe may have been seen for the first time. Dark matter is considered crucial to theories explaining how the universe is expanding and how galaxies interact, but has so far eluded scientists. Now, astronomers have produced the first direct images of a part of its network using a quasar as a ‘flashlight’. Computer simulations suggest that matter in the universe is distributed in a 'cosmic web' of filaments, as seen in the image above from a large-scale dark-matter simulation. The inset is a zoomed-in, high-resolution image of a smaller part of the cosmic web, 10 million light-years across . A quasar is a type of active galactic nucleus that emits intense radiation powered by a supermassive black hole at the centre of the galaxy. This particular quasar, located 10 billion light-years away, illuminated a vast nebula of diffuse gas to reveal the network of filaments that connect galaxies in a cosmic web. For years, cosmologists have been running computer simulations of the structure of the universe to develop what they refer to as the ‘standard model of cosmology’. Their calculations suggest that as the universe grows, matter becomes clustered like a huge cosmic web, weaving its way into in filaments and nodes under the force of gravity. This deep image shows the nebula (cyan) extending across 2 million light-years that was discovered around the bright quasar UM287 (at the center of the image). The energetic radiation of the quasar makes the surrounding intergalactic gas glow, revealing the morphology and physical properties of a cosmic web filament . Dark matter surrounds galaxies across the universe, and is invisible because it does not reflect light. It . cannot be seen directly with telescopes, but astronomers know it to be . out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we . can see. Galaxies, . for example, could not rotate the way they do and hold their shape . without the presence of dark matter, researchers say. The European Space Agency said: 'Shine a torch in a completely dark room, and you will see only what the torch illuminates. 'That does not mean that the room around you does not exist. 'Similarly we know dark matter exists but have never observed it directly.' Scientists are fairly sure it exists and . is crucial to the universe, but they do not know what it looks like or . where to find it. The latest results from the 10-metre Keck telescope in Hawaii, are reported by scientists from the University of California, Santa Cruz and the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg. ‘This is a very exceptional object: it's huge, at least twice as large as any nebula detected before, and it extends well beyond the galactic environment of the quasar,’ said first author Sebastiano Cantalupo, a postdoctoral fellow at UC Santa Cruz. The distance to the quasar is so great that the emitted light is ‘stretched’ by the expansion of the universe from an invisible ultraviolet wavelength to a visible shade of violet by the time it reaches the Keck Telescope. ‘We have studied other quasars this way without detecting such extended gas,’ Professor Cantalupo said. ‘The light from the quasar is like a flashlight beam, and in this case we were lucky that the flashlight is pointing toward the nebula and making the gas glow.’ In an earlier survey of distant quasars using the same technique to look for glowing gas, researchers detected so-called ‘dark galaxies,’ the densest knots of gas in the cosmic web. These dark galaxies are thought to be either too small or too young to have formed stars. ‘The dark galaxies are much denser and smaller parts of the cosmic web,’ said Professor Cantalupo. ‘In this new image, we also see dark galaxies, in addition to the much more diffuse and extended nebula. ‘Some of this gas will fall into galaxies, but most of it will remain diffuse and never form stars.’ While the observations support the computer simulations' picture of a cosmic web, the researchers' results suggest there is around 10 times more gas in the nebula than predicted. They believe the discrepancy may be due to limitations in the spatial resolution of the current models. It could be because the current grid-based models are missing some aspect of the underlying physics of how galaxies form and interact with quasars, they suggest. ‘These observations are challenging our understanding of intergalactic gas and giving us a new laboratory to test and refine our models,’ Professor Cantalupo said.","Images of the cosmic web were taken using the Keck telescope in Hawaii .

"By . Joshua Gardner . and Ashley Collman . For twenty days now, the New York City Police have been searching for Avonte Oquendo, the 14-year-old autistic boy who disappeared from his Long Island City school. According to a teachers' union memo obtained by Capital New York, none of the administrators at the brand-new Riverview School had passwords to access the security camera feeds on October 4, the day Avonte went missing. In response to the memo, schools chancellor Dennis Walcott said through a spokesman that the education department's 'Special Commissioner for Investigations is investigating what happened, and we intend to take a serious look at his findings'. Administrators at the brand-new Riverview School in Long Island City, didn't yet have access to security camera feeds the day 14-year-old autistic boy Avonte Oquendo went missing, according to a union memo . Missing: Avonte Oquendo is mute and autistic. He vanished October 4 from his Long Island City school in Queens, New York. Subway workers fanned out Saturday in search of the boy, who is fond of trains and has been fond wandering the tunnels before . Security footage of his escape was eventually acessed and aired on local television stations. It shows Avonte running down the hall and exiting the building through a side door. But according to the memo written on October 9, school security guards wouldn't have even seen Avonte leaving the building since they didn't have monitors to watch the security camera feeds. Runaway: CCTV footage shows Avonte Oquendo running through the corridors of his school towards the exit on October 4 . Avonte Oquendo is seen on the street outside his school on October 4 before he turned the corner and disappeared out of sight . Apparently there was 'no monitor at the front desk' and a 'console for [the] school security agent is also on order as well'. Without . access to that security footage, school officials originally believed . Avonte 'ran back up another staircase' and remained in the building . So . an hour after he went missing, they called Avonte's mother and had her . come in and try and coax him out of hiding by talking over the PA . system. Already gone: An hour after they noticed Avonte was missing, school officials called his mother to come in and try to coax him out of hiding - believing he was somewhere in the school . But as security footage would later reveal, he was long gone. In addition to the surveillance footage problems, there were other security aspects that could have prevented Avonte's disappearance had they been installed in the school that day. The memo mentions that the school informed employees after Avonte's disappearance that they would be installing temporary panic bars on the doorways to be replaced by permanent bars later. Vanessa Fontaine, left, Avonte's mother, arrives at a vigil for her son on October 11 in Queens. The missing boy's family have been informed of the discovery of human remains . Architecture firm Gran Kriegel Associates is also being brought in to look into other features to prevent future escapes such as additional cameras and windows on doors. A spokesman for the department of education declined to comment to Capital about the various security features that could have prevented Avonte's disappearance. Police commissioner Ray Kelly announced on Monday that the NYPD might be 'scaling down' the search for Avonte this week. Praying: A vigil was held for Avonte on October 12. Police Commissioner Ray Kelly announced earlier this week that the NYPD would be scaling down it's search for the 14-year-old . Several promising leads have failed to produce any results in the case, keeping both hope and disappointment very much alive.

Avonte was reportedly spotted at a school festival in the DUMBO neighborhood of Brooklyn on October 12 around 5:30pm, reports the Daily Dot.‘The kid in reference caused a bit of a stir as he stood very close [to the DJ],’ wrote the children’s entertainment company FuziPop on their Facebook page, ‘trying to touch the DJ equipment multiple times.’ Leads?  Avonte may have been sighted at a gathering in the DUMBO area of Brooklyn on October 11 . Avonte cannot care for himself and his family says he may appear soiled and has potentially stopped responding to his own name . Avonte’s brother Danny has helped make the online search go viral in the days since his disappearance. Thousands of followers have been added to Danny’s social media accounts and a Facebook page called Missing Avonte Oquendo has become a virtual hub for the search.Facebook followers have helped get the flier widely dispersed and have even gotten it translated into Chinese and Portuguese. ‘Avonte requires 24 hour supervision. He is 14 in body, but he has the mind of a very young child,’ reads the Facebook page. ‘Avonte has been alone for 10 days. He needs your help. He may appear dirty, he will have gone to the bathroom on himself, he may seem disoriented and no long answer to his name.’On October 12, family and friends organized a vigil Saturday and search parties have fanned out from their headquarters in Queens across the city to help bring Avonte home.'We get leads throughout the day, and whenever we get them, we try to take them seriously,' said Danny Oquendo. 'We call police detectives, then volunteers who go to that area.' Search continues: The search operations continued October 13 from their headquarters near Avonte's school in Queens and family remained hopeful Avonte would be found . The following morning, the search seemed to be focused in an area of Queens north of where Avonte first disappeared. ‘We need more volunteers to canvas the Ditmars area with a focus around 19th and 20th Ave between 37th Street and 81st street,’ Danny urged on his Twitter account @KingDetrick. ‘Go in groups!’ Avonte was last seen wearing black jeans, black sneakers, and a grey striped shirt. He is 5-foot-3 and weighs 125 pounds. Anyone with information is urged to call the NYPD Crime Stoppers line at 800-577-TIPS.","Avonte Oquendo, 14, disappeared from his Queens, New York school around noon on October 4 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Kim Kardashian's wedding dress looked sensational in front of a floor-to-ceiling white flower backdrop on her big day - and Kanye West has revealed that the ceremony's visual harmony was no fluke. The 37-year-old rapper admitted at the Cannes Lions Festival on Tuesday that the couple built the backdrop specifically to match Mrs Kardashian West's Haute Couture Givenchy gown. But the extravagant flower wall turned out to be problematic when, one day before the Florence ceremony, photographer Annie Leibovitz pulled out of shooting their wedding pictures.

'Because Annie pulled out, I was . like “I still want my wedding photos to look like Annie Leibovitz’s . photos,""' he revealed to the crowd. 'So we sat there and worked on that photo for four days – . because the flowers were off-color and stuff like that,' he said, referring to the couple's first official wedding photo, which was eventually released on Mrs Kardashian West's Instagram account after undergoing extensive retouching. ‘Can . you imagine telling someone who wants to just Instagram a photo, who’s . the number one person on Instagram, “We need to work on the color of . the flower wall”, or the idea that it’s a Givenchy dress, and it’s not . about the name Givenchy, it’s about the talent that is Riccardo Tisci - . and how important Kim is to the internet,' he explained. The couple – known as Kimye – tied the knot at the Forte di Belvedere in Florence last month in what is billed as the wedding of the year. Photoshop perfection: The 37-year-old rapper admitted that the couple built the backdrop . specifically to match Mrs Kardashian West's Haute Couture Givenchy gown - but that the flowers looked 'off color' in pictures . Plan B: Mr West revealed: 'I was like ""I still want my wedding photos to look like Annie Leibovitz's photos"".

However, fans had to wait days for the official photograph, called The Kiss, to be released. And for the first time, rapper Mr West revealed why during a panel discussion about technology and culture. The . discussion, entitled ‘Technology, Culture and Consumer Adoption: . Learning to Read the Cultural Landscape,’ talked about how digital . progress and cultural evolution are linked. Mr West also revealed how the extensive Photoshopping of their first Instagram picture 'pissed my girl off during the honeymoon'. 'We sat there and worked on that photo for four days – . because the flowers were off-color and stuff like that' 'She was exhausted because we worked on the photo so much - because Annie Leibovitz pulled out of the wedding, because I think she was scared of the idea of celebrity,' he said, before adding that it was worth the wait. 'The fact the number one most-liked photo [on Instagram] has a kind of aesthetic was a win for what the mission is, which is raising the palette. ‘It was a long time,’ he added – drawing laughs from the audience.

And for the first time, Mr West revealed why during the panel discussion about technology and culture . The custom-made, Givenchy creation hugged her curvy frame perfectly, and featured long lace sleeves with strategic sheer panels, including a sheer back that incorporated some of the bride's signature sexy touch. 'Still feels like a dream!"" she wrote on Twitter. 'Thank you @RiccardoTisci17 for making me the most gorgeous gown I've ever seen! I'm so grateful @givenchyofficial for this Givenchy Couture wedding gown!' Wearing Givenchy proved to be a family affair as both North and Mr West were outfitted by Mr Tisci - who outfitted Mrs Kardashian West in a controversial dress for the 2013 Met Gala - for the special day. North's custom-made, Haute Couture creation was made to resemble her mom's dress, while Mr West wore a custom tux. During the panel discussion, which was moderated by Bloomberg News, Mr West also said that he believed his music video for Bound 2 was only accepted after he Mrs Kardashian West appeared on the cover of Vogue. The singer explained that it was the endorsement of the fashion magazine which enabled the couple to be ‘understood’ after ‘two years of people not understanding an interracial relationship.’ From backlash to endorsement: Mr West also said he believes acceptance of his relationship with his new wife took two years - and the seal of . approval from Vogue . He said: ‘You have to be able to take the lashes when people don’t understand. 'Two years of people not understanding an interracial relationship, two years of people not understanding the idea of the art world meets the pop world, you have to take the lash and be able to swim in the backlash. ‘I get bashed so much but create so much, just know that if you want to be a boxer you’re going to get your face beaten constantly but then you may end up being a Mayweather or an Ali at the end of the day.’ Mr West went on to discuss his now infamous video for Bound 2, which features his wife sitting topless on his lap while he rides a motorbike. ‘I still take a bashing for the Bound video. I always say that if Vogue had come out before the Bound video then everyone would have been like “oh, it’s okay” and that’s the endorsement,’ he said. ‘It took something established like Vogue to make everything okay and we had to wait. Like we had the wedding and then they were like ""that’s cool now” because they were told by people who endorsed it.’ Mr West was in conversation with Steve Stout, Stephanie Ruhle and Ben Horowitz at a talk entitled Translation: Technology, Culture, and Consumer Adoption: Learning to Read the Cultural Landscape held at the Palais des Festivals.",The 37-year-old rapper also admitted that it then took the newlywed couple four days to perfect their first wedding Instagram using Photoshop .
"By . Roger Lewis . Kristie Macrakis’s  gripping study of secret writing in its hidden or invisible form is chiefly a history of espionage techniques, or what John le  Carré used to call tradecraft. Though, as Macrakis says, ‘invisible ink conjures up images of childhood magic and fun’ — a world of wonder encompassing card tricks, numerology and rabbits appearing from hats — the subject of sleight-of-hand actually impinges on notions of death and danger, privacy, freedom, and the cancer of state surveillance. Macrakis has spent her career in the archives, sifting through declassified documents, familiarising herself with chemicals and abstruse formulae — and the history of invisible inks and surreptitious communication is a long one. Master spy: Daniel Craig as the famous James Bond . The story begins in Ancient Greece and Rome, when messages were hidden in the belly of a hare, the incision sewn up, and then the creature handed to a trusted servant in a hunting net. Two thousand years later, the gambit was still in force. The CIA used freeze-dried rats as concealment devices. Greek generals sent messages to their commanders by scrawling with the juice of medicinal herbs or ‘the milky substance from wild figs’. The parchment was allowed to dry. When later it was sprinkled with ashes, the letters became visible. Another useful ink was urine, which became readable when covered with dust. Messages could also be scratched on wax-coated tablets, or on rolled-up beaten lead worn as earrings. Sheets of papyrus were inserted into bridles or breastplates. Spies sent messages hidden in dog collars or engraved them on toenails, which were revealed with powdered charcoal. In China, the emperor wrote on silk, rolled it in a ball, covered the pellet with wax, called for the messenger and placed it in his rectum. The chaps at Parcelforce don’t know they are born. In a more credulous age, invisible writing was seen as a branch of the necromantic arts. Because he recommended trapping a dormouse and extracting its juices to use as invisible ink, in 1558 Giambattista della Porta was examined by the Inquisition. It looked like the work of the Devil, a text appearing when the paper was heated — made ‘visible through fire’. Rodent mail: The CIA used freeze-dried rats as concealment devices . Elizabethan England, using tricks perfected in the monasteries, was a particular age of secrecy and intrigue, and Francis Walsingham’s network of agents and informants was always finding evidence of Catholic plots concealed in wine bottles or wedged in embroidered slippers. ‘Secret letters were placed in a waterproof box and stuffed through the bunghole of a beer barrel.’ The supporters of Mary Queen of Scots plotted a rebellion against the throne — and Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush in the Cate Blanchett film Elizabeth) found messages scratched with pickling juice inscribed between the lines of bibles and prayer books. The corner of pages would be snipped as a signal that something was written on it. The material was intercepted and the conspirators tortured on the rack, hanged, drawn and quartered. Crafty: Geoffrey Rush as Elizabethan secret agent Francis Walsingham . Walsingham also craftily forged letters, asking for the names and addresses of confederates — men who were also then disembowelled and hanged. Mary herself was beheaded in 1587. Less dramatically, invisible ink has  been used to decorate fire-screens. Impregnated with cobalt chloride, the panels would depict images as they warmed up. Scientists such as Robert Boyle, using a mixture of sulphur and ammonium chloride, in the 1670s wrote notes and calculations invisibly  in exercise-books — to prevent a  theft of their ideas. Owing to the  smell, the gullible again suspected ‘occult processes.’ But it was always during wars that this branch of cryptography — of codes and ciphers — was most prized. By 1915, MI5 was monitoring the mail of 13,524 citizens, opening the post sent to foreign addresses. By these means German double-agents were discovered, who were using lemon juice to tell the enemy about British troop movements. Scotland Yard found blotting paper, nibs and lemons in the accused’s lodgings. The fresh, juicy lemon was prime evidence at the trial, and the spies were shot at the Tower of London. Spies were found to hide their inks — generally slightly more sophisticated than lemons — in medicine bottles, soap, toothpaste, chewing gum, and pomade. It was even soaked into pairs of socks. Agents during the Cold War were issued with special pens and pads. Detection and concealment grew ever more ingenious, with ultraviolet and infrared photography to reveal messages, ferrous oxides with which to sponge the paper, and microscopic analysis of documents to trace alien particles or the indentation of fibres. Spies were found to hide their invisible inks in medicine bottles, . soap, toothpaste, chewing gum, and pomade. It was even soaked into . pairs of socks . ‘Every contact leaves a trace,’  says Macrakis, sounding like Sherlock Holmes. The biggest new development was the invention of the microdot by Emanuel Goldberg in 1925, which meant files could be reduced to the size of postage stamps or full-stops on typed letters. During World War II, the Americans arrested saboteurs who were using microdots to collaborate with the Nazis’ quest for information about atomic energy, and who were also sending Berlin reports about the extent of the destruction of American oil stores at Pearl Harbor. The spies went to the electric chair. With cyberspace and the internet, today we have come a long way from lemons — though human deviousness is the same. The contemporary equivalent of Walsingham is a ‘computer forensic investigator’. Cyber spying: Al-Qaeda, founded by Osama Bin Laden (pictured), apparently exchange hidden messages in pornography . Apparently, Al Qaeda exchange hidden messages in the pixels of digital pornographic movies. So that’s what they are doing all day in GCHQ at Cheltenham, watching Sexy Tanja over and over. But a good job they are — as concealed in the binary codes of one film’s text files were plans about seizing hostages on a passenger ship. Images on eBay auction sites are also terrorist hiding places. Were I an evil mastermind I’d utilise tapes of Dickinson’s Real Deal — who’d think to look there? The former Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc police routinely opened the mail, tapped phones and monitored and mistrusted their own citizens. The Stasi had automated equipment to slit open envelopes, copy and re-seal the post. Macrakis is correct to argue the secret services in Western democracies have always envied the enemy’s brutality in this regard — and since 9/11 they have been granted and now enjoy totalitarian powers ‘to read everyone’s email with one keystroke’. We can’t go out of the door without being on some government CCTV camera. It is as if the Inquisition is back, and ‘the hidden is exposed. The invisible becomes visible. The obscure is deciphered. The unknown becomes known. Betrayal is unmasked.’ And all future thoughts of (or rights to) a private life are obliterated. Scary. Big Brother has been born.","Invisible ink used throughout the ages to communicate in secret .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Tesco has bowed to public pressure and says it will remove unnecessary nut allergy warnings from products such as ham, baked beans and even tonic water. The supermarket triggered anger among allergy sufferers earlier this year after ‘may contain nuts’ warnings were added to hundreds of products without good reason. Sufferers were left confused about what was safe to eat after the warning appeared on everything from cooked ham to apple juice, tonic water, bags of new potatoes and baked beans. Nut allergy sufferers found they could not buy hundreds of products including apple juice and potatoes . The firm has finally relented after refusing to remove the labels which 'comply with EU rules' Thousands of people signed a petition calling on the store to remove the warnings. Tesco initially rejected the complaints, saying it had changed the format of its labels to comply with EU rules due to come in later this year. But Britain’s biggest grocer has now . relented, admitting it went too far and announcing that the warnings . will be removed from many of the products. A spokesman said: ‘Recently, how we label has changed and in that changeover the “may contain” statement has been put on products it shouldn’t and caused a lot of confusion and anguish among our customers – for which we are very sorry.’ He said Tesco’s policy was to carry warning labels only where there was a genuine risk and the company had asked suppliers to review the need to apply the nuts safety message to packs. ‘The risk assessments for products with a “may contain” statement are being reviewed and where following that review we can’t demonstrate there is a significant risk of cross-contamination we will remove the “may contain” statement,’ he added. Campaigner Alexa Baracaia, whose . three-year-old son is allergic to nuts, welcomed the change of policy, . but said the campaign would continue. ‘While we obviously welcome Tesco’s admission after weeks of claiming otherwise that they did get their labelling wrong, we now want Tesco to engage with us properly and fully until the situation is resolved,’ she told the Grocer. ‘We expect to be kept informed of which items will see the “may contain” labels removed and when. ‘Tesco also needs to dramatically improve its communications with allergic consumers: we are entitled to full explanations of risk for specific products and will absolutely not be fobbed off with any more generalised and, indeed, factually incorrect responses from ill-informed staff.’","Sufferers left confused by warnings on hundreds of supermarket products .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Concept images of Apple's Cupertino headquarters only reveal one part of a story which began in 2011 when co-founder Steve Jobs laid down plans for a futuristic new campus. During an interview with Architectural Record, chief architect Sir Norman Foster gave an additional insight into how Apple's 'spaceship' will be built - as well as the inspiration behind its circular and 'organic' design. This includes cars being 'banished and buried' in underground car parks, tarmac being replaced by greenery and windows that stretch the full height of the four-storey main building that slide open. Scroll down for video . During an interview with Architectural Record, chief architect Norman Foster gave an insight into how Apple's 'spaceship' headquarters in Cupertino, illustration pictured, will be built - as well as the inspiration behind the circular design of the main building on the 175-acre site. Work is expected to be completed in 2016 . He also revealed that there will be room for 1,000 bikes and the tricks he is using to make the giant campus seem compact. 'It's interesting how it evolved,' explained Foster. 'First of all, there was a smaller site. Then, as the project developed, and the Hewlett-Packard site became available, the scale of the project changed. The reference point for Steve [Jobs] was always the large space on the Stanford campus - the Main Quad - which Steve knew intimately. He would reminisce about the time when he was young, and California was still the fruit bowl of the United States. It was still orchards.' With this in mind, Foster said he wanted to add a series of 'organic segments' to the Cupertino building - nicknamed . the Apple spaceship because of its vast circular shape that covers 175-acre and features a man-made forest of more than 7,000 trees. He also wanted the circular building to surround a private space in the centre, designed to replicate the California landscape, and mimic the orchards that Jobs remembered fondly. As a result, Foster told Architectural Record: 'The car would visually be banished, and tarmac would be replaced by greenery, and car parks by jogging and bicycle trails.' The ring-shaped structure was Jobs’ brainchild, yet after his death British designer Jony Ive took the . project on with the help of Sir Foster, and the local council approved their ambitious plans last year. Foster said he wanted to add a series of 'organic segments' to the Cupertino building because co-founder Steve Jobs wanted the circular building to surround a private space in the centre, designed to replicate the California landscape, and mimic the orchards that Jobs remembered fondly as a child. The plans feature underground parking hidden from view, illustration pictured. Sir Foster told Architectural Record: 'The car would visually be banished, and tarmac would be replaced by greenery' During his initial proposals, Apple's co-founder Steve Jobs said he wanted the building to be covered in 40ft floor-to-ceiling panes of curved glass so that all of the building's four storeys would be visible from the outside and offer a large amount of natural light, pictured. Sir Foster said these glass panels 'can literally move sideways and just open up into the landscape' to make the building seem more open . This room-sized mock-up of the planned new Apple headquarters in Cupertino was released in November last year before executives submitted their final plans to the council . Apple's Campus 2 was designed by Sir Norman Foster, pictured, and his firm Foster and Partners. The architectural experts also designed Wembley Stadium, London City Hall and The Gherkin . When Jobs first submitted the plans . back in 2011 the campus was billed as 'the best office building in the . world'. It has taken since then to get approval from the local council . and its likely the campus won't be completed until 2016. Reports . in April 2013 claimed the project had already exceeded its budget by . around $2 billion (£1.32bn), pushing the total cost up to around $5 . billion (£3.14 billion) and putting it a year behind schedule. Earlier . this year Apple was asked to submit new plans with updated landscaping . designed, a slightly revised floor layout, renderings, and a bicycle . plan, however the overall main design wasn't changed. Under these . updated plans, the campus was renamed Apple Campus 2. Appearing as a giant saucer, the Silicon Valley site near the 280 Highway will be home to 13,000 Apple employees. When asked how these employees will make their way around the huge campus, Sir Foster said: 'The proximity, the adjacencies are very, very carefully considered. 'Remember also that the scale is broken down by cafes and lobbies and entrances. You have four-storey-high glass walls, which can literally move . sideways and just open up into the landscape. So the social facilities . break down the scale.' Sir . Foster added there will also be jogging and cycling trails, with . more than a thousand bikes kept on site at all times, which staff can . use to make their way around. The . Spaceship will have 360-degree curved glass fronted walls and central . courtyard as well as a 1,000-seater auditorium, a gym and 300,000 square . feet of 'research' space. Apple Campus 2 will additionally have . underground parking hidden from view, meaning 80 per cent of the site . can be covered in trees. The site was previously owned by Hewlett Packard and the majority of the area is currently covered in asphalt. The . new images also show access roads that lead into tunnels that take cars . into the underground car park. They also show the parts of the car park . that will be on show pictured covered in plants and greenery to help it . blend in with the natural surroundings. This image shows the Apple Campus 2 from above. The site will be surrounded by a man-made forest featuring 7,000 trees. It was previously owned by Hewlett Packard and is currently covered in around 80 per cent asphalt . Among the 7,000 trees that will be planted around the campus, the firm intends to plant species that blossom at different times of the year. This includes apple trees, as well as cherry blossoms, plum trees and other fruit trees and bushes similar to the ones pictured . Inside the third-of-a-mile wide building will be 1,000-seater auditorium where Apple's CEO Tim Cook will present the company's keynotes ahead of product launches, for example. This auditorium will be covered with a circular glass pavilion, pictured, that will also be an access point for employees and guests . Elsewhere . underground, the auditorium will be where Apple's CEO Tim Cook will . present the companies keynotes ahead of product launches, for example. This auditorium will be covered with a circular glass pavilion that will . also be an access point for employees and guests. Natural gas will, primarily, provide . the building's power and the local energy grid will only be accessed in . emergencies. The glass structure will also be fitted with solar panels. ‘You see the energy and the love and . the attention to detail that we've put into this,’ said Apple CFO Peter . Oppenheimer at an unveiling of the top secret spaceship plans. ‘We have treated this project just as . we would any Apple product. And this will be a place for the most . creative and collaborative teams in the industry to innovate for decades . to come.’ The circular, four-storey building will be around a mile in circumference and a third of a mile wide and was recently described by the San Fransisco Weekly as a ‘massive glass doughnut’. The . building stays eco-friendly with natural ventilation that works instead . of air-conditioning for 70 per cent of the year, low energy LED . lighting where natural light doesn’t reach, and on-site recycling. Much of the inside of the futuristic building will also be made of glass with stone-coloured walls to add to the building's natural-looking design, pictured. The 175-acre Silicon Valley site near the 280 Highway will house 13,000 staff . Not all of the parking spaces will be hidden. The parts of the multi-storey car park that will be on show, according to this latest image from Apple, will be covered in plants and greenery to help the concrete structure blend in . ‘This will be one of the most environmentally sustainable developments on this scale anywhere in the world,'’ said Apple’s Whisenhunt. In the centre will be an enclosed . arboretum and orchard complete with thousands of fruit, oak, and olive . trees according to the San Jose Mercury-News. ‘We . love California, and by adding over 2,500 new and indigenous trees that . truly belong here,’ Oppenheimer said, ‘we're bringing back the . beautiful orchards that once made up this valley.’ Campus . 2 was designed by Sir Foster's firm Foster and Partners.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An Ohio couple were found guilty on Friday of enslaving a mentally disabled woman for two years through intimidation, abuse and threats that they would harm her young child. Jordie Callahan and his girlfriend Jessica Hunt were convicted in Youngstown a day after their lawyers argued that prosecutors had built their case around unreliable witnesses. But prosecutors said the couple kept the woman and her daughter, who was under age 5, in a damp, dark basement and threatened both with a python and pit bulls. Guilty: Jordie Callahan and Jessica Hunt have been convicted of enslaving a mentally disabled woman . Threatening: A court heard Callahan and his girlfriend used pythons to intimidate their victim . The basement where the victims were kept had a lock on the door and no bathroom. The woman, who has not been named, was forced to shop, cook, clean up after the couple's dogs and do household chores, assistant U.S. attorney Chelsea Rice said. Prosecutors said the woman also was forced to engage in sexual acts. Callahan, 27, and Hunt, 32, were convicted on charges that included forced labor conspiracy with a kidnapping specification, and could be sentenced to as much as life in prison. The couple were found not guilty of stealing the woman's government benefits and tampering with a witness. Hunt shook her head 'no' when the verdicts were announced. 'There were a lot of horrific allegations made by the government in this case that we do not believe were supported by the evidence,' Ed Bryan, Hunt's attorney, said. On trial: Jessica Hunt and Jordie Callahan threatened and abused a mentally disabled woman . Fear: The couple are accused of threatening the woman with their snakes and pit bulls . Callahan's attorney, Donald Butler, said he hopes to appeal. Prosecutors said the woman's ordeal lasted from early 2011 to late 2012. Police in the northern Ohio town of Ashland first got involved when the woman was arrested on a candy bar shoplifting case and asked to be jailed because people had been mean to her. The woman and her daughter were freed after police investigated an abuse allegation one of the suspects made against her. Authorities said that allegation was a ruse, complete with a video staged by the suspects. They said the suspects had forced the woman to act as if she were mistreating her child. The woman later pleaded guilty to child endangering and was sentenced to about five months in jail. She served only part of that sentence. Hunt's attorney accused investigators of sensationalizing what happened and using unreliable witnesses, including two who pleaded guilty in connection with the case. He said Hunt was only trying to help a homeless acquaintance by giving her a place to live and didn't force her to stay. Callahan's attorney said during closing arguments on Thursday that Hunt and Callahan used drugs and lived a different lifestyle, but that did not mean they mistreated the woman who lived with them. 'Even at the bottom of society, they relied on each other. That's all this was,' Butler said. But prosecutors said that when the woman was allowed to go shopping, the defendants threatened to beat the child if the woman spent too much money or didn't return quickly enough. The two defendants who pleaded guilty earlier in the forced-labor case are scheduled for sentencing later this month. Trial: Hunt, pictured handling a snake, shook her head as the guilty verdict was read out . Forced labor: Callahan and Hunt forced the mentally disabled woman to clear up after their family and pets . Daniel Brown, who was accused of helping to enslave and beat the woman, pleaded guilty to a single conspiracy charge. His plea required him to cooperate with investigators and testify. Dezerah Silsby, who was accused of using ice cream to lure the woman and her child back into the home, entered her plea under the terms of a sealed agreement. Silsby testified that Hunt threatened her and forced her to clean the couple's apartment and that she drove the woman and Hunt to an ATM to get money using the woman's government funds debit card. The U.S. attorney's office said Silsby pleaded guilty to four counts of an indictment charging her with threatening the woman, beating her and making her do housework. An FBI affidavit said Silsby smashed the woman's hand with a rock so she could go to a hospital and bring back pain medication for the suspects.","Jordie Callahan and Jessica Hunt were convicted of forced labor .

"By . Kirk Maltais . A former NFL player who was forced into retirement after a series of concussions released a music video Thursday that serves not only as a touching tribute to his wife and three daughters, but as a reminder of his love for them in the event that he loses his own memory. Ben Utecht, 33, wrote his new song 'You Will Always Be My Girls' while sitting in an airplane cruising at 30,000 feet. As wrote the lyrics, he had to pull the brim of his hat down to conceal the tears that were streaming off of his cheeks. 'Probably the most difficult thing I've ever had to do,' Utecht told CBS News. Scroll Down For Video . Utecht with his family in a scene in his new music video for 'You Will Always Be My Girls.' Utecht's plans for retirement changed once he began to struggle with symptoms from his traumatic brain injuries . Utecht testifying to a Senate committee regarding the effects of concussions . According to Utecht, who was forced out of the NFL after he sustained a series of traumatic brain injuries over the course of his five year career, the song was written as a way to express his love for his wife Karyn and his three young daughters, in the event that the memory loss he suffers as a result of his injuries worsened to the point where he could no longer remember them. 'It was a chance for me to tell my girls that no matter what happens to . me and my brain,' he told the Minneapolis Star Tribune, 'they’re always going to be there.' Utecht, a tight end who had won the Super Bowl with the Indianapolis Colts in 2006, had always planned to be a professional singer after his retirement. His unceremonious exit from football came in 2009, when he sustained a concussion while practicing with the Cincinnati Bengals, the fifth brain injury he sustained in the NFL. Utecht, who lost consciousness in the incident, was placed on the injured reserve after the injury, and effectively forced into retirement by November 2009. He was 29.

He suffered five traumatic brain injuries total during his career in the NFL . After the injury, Utecht experienced common side effects of brain injuries, such as amnesia, dizziness and sudden mood changes. According to him, when his oldest daughter told a family doctor that she was sometimes afraid of her Dad, it 'broke his heart' and he had 'a wake-up call.' 'To really think about a time where I may wake up someday and not . recognize the person that I’ve been lying next to for the last 30 years, . yeah, that’s scary,' he told the Star Tribune. 'I think every person would fear . something like that.' Utecht then began his work as an activist for increasing public awareness of issues related to brain injuries and concussions. Recently, he was named a national spokesperson for the American . Academy of Neurology and the American Brain Foundation. This week, Utecht participated in the White House Concussion Summit and shared his own story about the effects of brain injury with the . Senate Committee on Aging in Washington, D.C.. 'At 29, I started to have memory problems, and it took losing my mind to care about my mind,' he told the committee. Utecht dancing with his wife in a scene from his music video, released on Thursday . Utecht's activism through music and public appearances comes at a time when the NFL is dealing with a host of lawsuits filed by former players. Notable players, such as former Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon and former San Diego Chargers linebacker Junior Seau, have joined into a class action lawsuit which reached a tentative settlement this week after a previous agreement for $765 million was rejected by a federal judge. Utecht is using his new music video to promote for the cause, including in the YouTube description of the video a link to the webiste for The American Brain Foundation.

"A young mother today revealed how she thought she was going to die on a fairground ride when part of her seat came off while she was spinning 200ft in the air. Darcy Gordon, 23, was on the ‘Star Flyer’ swing ride at a Christmas fairground in Edinburgh when the back section of her seat fell away. She was left clinging to ropes across her seat as the huge chunk of fibreglass casing plunged to the street below. Miss Darcy, a supermarket worker from Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, said: 'We had just got to the top when I felt the back of the seat come away but the ride kept on going and we were clinging to the ropes at the side. Darcy Gordon, 23, pictured left, has told of the horrifying moment the back of her chair fell off, pictured right, while she was 200ft in the air on a spinning fairground ride called the 'Star Flyer' Dangerous: Miss Gordon was left clinging the the ropes supporting the rest of her seat until the ride finished after the back section of her chair came off . 'I didn’t want to lean back as I thought there was no back left. The whole thing lasted about two minutes but it felt a lot, lot longer. 'I was sure that I was going to die. I was waiting for us to fall or fly off into a building or something. My arms are still hurting me because I was gripping on so tight.' Miss Gordon, who has a four-year old son, was physically sick as she got off the ride and left in a state of shock after the incident. Miss Gordon added: 'None of the staff showed any concern towards us - they just kept saying ""keep walking"". 'I couldn’t move I was in so much shock. I was shaking and really could not move. 'It . was the scariest experience of my life but they were more concerned . about getting me away. It’s disgusting how they have treated us, they . never one asked how we were.' Allegations: Miss Gordon claims staff running the ride seemed unconcerned at the shocking incident . The £7.50 fairground attraction had been closed for maintenance earlier that day but had reopened to the public at around 5pm. She was on the ride with friend Chris Cardwell when the plastic moulding from their seat broke off and fell onto the ride’s box office roof, before bouncing to the ground. Thousands of festive revellers were milling around St Andrew Square at the time but fortunately no one was injured. Miss Gordon and her friend decided upon taking a spin on the attraction after they spotted it while riding the Big Wheel in Princes Street Gardens. Within seconds of being strapped in though, Mr Cardwell became aware of the malfunctioning seatback and urged Miss Gordon not to 'move about so much'. She added. 'I asked him why and he said he’d tell me after the ride, he didn’t want to worry me as he knew I’d freak out. Seconds later it had fallen off.' Miss Gordon’s nerves weren’t the only things left shattered by the experience - the screen of her phone which she had in her trouser pocket was smashed as she clung on for dear life. Ride bosses have since agreed to both refund her money and repair her phone. Murray Petit, 21, from Fairmilehead, who . was in line to get on the ride after Miss Gordon’s turn, snapped a . picture of the damaged red seatback in the minutes after it came . crashing to the ground. He said: 'We heard a bang but had no idea what it was. My friend and I then went to go and sit in the seats when we were told to get off. 'A guy in the crowd then told us that a seat had fallen off. It all happened so fast that it was only later we thought about what could have happened. Someone could easily have been killed.' A spokesman for Edinburgh’s Christmas said: 'Detailed safety inspections were carried out on Saturday following the incident and the ride has been inspected to the satisfaction of an independent safety inspector and expert in amusement rides. 'The incident is completely unrelated to the maintenance which was carried out on the ride earlier in the day on Friday December 13 and which was part of the routine maintenance to the ride.'

"By . David Kent . Mexico coach Miguel Herrera just can't keep his joy bottled up, and his enthusiasm has made him one of the most entertaining and popular figures of the World Cup and an internet sensation worldwide. Memes of Herrera flood the web. One shows his hair catching on fire cartoon-style. In another he playfully sticks out his tongue while photobombing three members of his team on the pitch. In a video, he dances happily to Spanish ska music. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the reason Miguel Herrera missed the 1994 World Cup . Eccentric: Mexico coach Miguel Herrera has become recognisable for his antics at the World Cup . Wild: Herrera celebrated the goal that sealed Mexico's progression by jumping on to one of his players . Forget, for a moment at least, Herrera's success in turning around the troubled Mexican team, to face Holland in the last-16 on Sunday. Football fans around the globe have fallen in love with the man's colourful antics and pulsation towards his country, which are often as absorbing as the goals flying in. 'He is so authentic, so expressive and so genuine,' said Enrique Krauze, a Mexican historian and World Cup commentator. 'He's becoming the representation of the Mexicans' ability to celebrate and party. That is very seductive.' Although he wears a suit and a tie, Herrera rumbles up and down the sidelines like a classic Mexican wrestler. When his players score, he shakes his arms in the air and seemingly goes into a state of euphoria, throwing his short, stout body up and down the sidelines. Hero: Mexico fans hold up a cardboard cutout of the manager's face as they enjoy beating Croatia to qualify . Keeping up: Mexican goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa ran to his manager and leapt on him to celebrate . Letting loose: Herrera missed the 1994 World Cup in USA because of this horrific challenge . He's gone flying! Herrera ended up kicking Honduras attacker Dolmo Flores up in the air in frustration . Selfie o'clock! Herrera took this picture for his 750,000 followers on social networking site Twitter . He jumps atop one player like a friendly puppy, carries another team member in his arms like a proud father or simply kneels down on the sideline, face up, eyes closed, ecstatic. During the World Cup, sportscasters have affectionately compared Herrera to a cartoon monster - Tweety Bird's version of Mr. Hyde, from an animated short by Warner Bros. There is unquestionably a humorous resemblance, right down to the shock of sandy hair. And he's not afraid of ruffling his side up. 'If a player can’t go one month or 20 days without having sexual relations, then they are not prepared to be a professional player,' he told the Mexican newspaper Reforma. 'So then we will not be looking for sex or having sex at the World Cup just to have it, we are going to go after what we came for, a competition that gives us the opportunity to rise above and do something really great.' Herrera's theatrical gestures are not new to Mexican fans who followed him through his two years as a coach for Mexico City's America soccer club. Celebrations: Herrera reacts as Adres Guardado scores the goal that sealed Mexico's last 16 place in Brazil . Congratulations: Croatia boss Niko Kovac acknowledges his opposite number after the game . But his . performances on the pitch during the World Cup have won new admirers for . the man known as 'Piojo', or louse, since he played for Mexico's . professional Atlante team.

Herrera . has more followers on Twitter than other coaches - 735,000 - and often . posts selfies to his official account; a favourite is a June 15 snap . with a legion of Mexico fans in the background. 'You generally don't hear a lot about the coaches,' said Jesus Berumen, 59, a Mexican fan in Los Angeles. 'He spreads happiness. He's so natural in the way he does things.' Hugs: Herrera hugs goalkeeper Ochoa affectionately following qualification for the last 16 of the World Cup . Jumping for joy: Herrera celebrates with Paul Aguilar after Hernandez scored for Mexico against Croatia . Herrera's . overly enthusiastic nature hasn't always attracted positive attention. As a player, he was on the precipice of making the Mexican team for the . 1994 World Cup in America, but was scratched after he wildly tackled a . Honduras player during a qualifying match. He still insists he doesn't . know why he didn't make the team. There was also the occasion he called the Bosnia team 'dirty pigs' after losing a recent friendly and has defending fans chanting of a gay slur while an opposing goalkeeper takes a goal kick, claiming it's 'not that bad'. His . coaching career began in 2002, but it wasn't until nine years later . that he really made his name, leading the under-performing America side . to the Mexican league championship last year, and earning a reputation . for turning teams around. Herrera was chosen as an interim solution last autumn when little hope remained for Mexico qualifying for the World Cup.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The UK Independence Party has been accused of fuelling the same ‘distrust’ of foreigners which swept Europe before the outbreak of First World War. Liberal Democrat Lord Tyler sparked a major row with UKIP leader Nigel Farage with a warning against blaming ‘foreigner scapegoats for our economic troubles’. The peer made the provocative remarks during a House of Lords debate on how best to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the Great War. War of words: Lib Dem Lord Tyler questioned how much UKIP's Nigel Farage knew about the First World War, but it emerged Mr Farage runs his own tours of battlefields . The peer claimed Mr Farage would ‘do well to revisit the history of that period’ to learn that ‘fomenting distrust can so easily lead to hatred’. However, it emerged Mr Farage runs regular tours of First World War battlefields and he said his opposition to the European Union was in part informed by the way the collapse of the single currency had fuelled 'hatred' between eurozone countries. As part of national commemorations next year, 100 years on from the start of the conflict, children from every state secondary school will travel to the battlefields as part of a £50million package of events. David Cameron has said Britain had a duty to ‘honour those who served, remember those who died and ensure the lessons learnt live with us forever’. But Lord Tyler, a former MP for North Cornwall, said the tone of the events must reflect how the sacrifice of millions ‘did not achieve the war to end all wars that they thought they were fighting for’. The criticism of Mr Farage appeared to backfire after it emerged the UKIP leader conducts tours of World War One battlefields every year . Lord Tyler said his three uncles died in the conflict which was 'largely . pointless, meaningless and avoidable'. He went on: 'We should not be celebrating its . absurd origins, however much we may pay tribute to those who fought, . were wounded or lost their lives. ‘Instead, we must remind ourselves of the futility of negative nationalism, so sharply distinct from positive patriotism.’ He . then went on to appear to draw parallels between the rise of UKIP based . on attacking 'foreigner scapegoats' and the spread of nationalism . across continental Europe before 1914. More than a million Britons died in the First World War. The Battle of the Somme was one of the most deadly in the four year conflict. Here a party of Royal Irish Rifles is pictured in a communication trench on the first day of the Battle of the Somme . Personal accounts of life on the frontline are likely to feature heavily in next year's commemorations, most notably from the Battle of the Somme, the bloodiest day in the history of the British army . The First World War was sparked by the assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz . Ferdinand by a Serbian during a visit to Sarajevo on June 28 1914. As the two countries clashed, their allies lined up in support with Germany backing Austria, with Russia, Britain and France sympathising with Serbia. A period of of grand-standing, abortive talks and partial mobilisation of troops culminated in Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia on July 28. Germany declared war on Russia on August 1 and then France on August 3, demanding free passage through Belgium, which lead Britain to declare war on Germany. On August 6 Austria-Hungary declared war on Russia and within weeks Japan had also entered the conflict. David Cameron unveiled plans to for the commemorations for the 100th anniversary of the start of the First World War at the Imperial War Museum in London . Lord Tyler said the catalogue of events in 1914 marked 'a terrible failure of common sense and common humanity'. He told peers: 'I will find it difficult to mark the centenary of the war's . outbreak with anything other than a resolve that we should do all we can . to reconcile the peoples of Europe in the 21st century, avoiding new . foreigner scapegoats for our economic troubles, and perhaps also . reminding ourselves of the 1914 warmongering populism of the British . press, which seems familiar.' ‘I . do not know where Mr Farage's ancestors were between 1914 and 1918, but . he would do well to revisit the history of that period. Fomenting . distrust can so easily lead to hatred.’ The remarks come just days after UKIP ran the Lib Dems a close second in the hotly-contested Eastleigh by-election, as all the main parties wrestle with how to respond to the rise of the Eurosceptic party. Lord Tyler told MailOnline today: ‘Making a scapegoat of other peoples for problems which are closer to home is extremely dangerous. ‘Clearly [UKIP] are more serious players than they were so they have got to watch how they approach these issues.’ However, Mr Farage told MailOnline the criticism was ‘totally absurd’. Twice a year he leads tours of World War One battlefields, with groups of friends, colleagues and visiting politicians whom he labels ‘Farage’s Foragers’. ‘I know a lot about the First World War and its origins and I know that in the wake of it we formed something called Yugoslavia to stop Balkan conflicts and look where that got us. ‘It is totally absurd, and I would invite Lord Tyler to go and visit Athens and see real hatred. They now hate the Germans more than at any time since 1945. ‘I want us to have a Europe of independent nation states that trade and co-operate together. ‘But if you force people together against their will, history tells us the long-term outcome will be deeply, deeply unpleasant. 'You breed extreme nationalism. Lord Tyler is 50 years out of date with his analysis of what Europe is.’ Commemorations marking the centenary of  the First World War will last five years and cost £50million. They will include: . £5.3million . to allow children and teachers from every secondary school to visit . battlefields such as the Somme, Verdun and Fromelles. National . commemorations on August 4, 2014, to recall the first day of the . conflict; on July 1, 2016,to remember the first day of the Somme; and in . 2018 to mark the centenary of Armistice Day. £15million . in grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund to support events across the . country. Ideas include friendly football matches to mark the 1914 . Christmas Day truce on the Western Front.

"By . Kirk Maltais . New imagery released by NASA this week further reinforced the destructive power of the storms that struck the town of Pilger, Nebraska, literally carving paths into the ground that are visible from space. In a comparison of images taken from The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (otherwise known as ASTER) instrument aboard NASA's Terra satellite, the paths that the two tornadoes that touched down in the area took can be seen. The first image, taken July 4, shows the area one week before the July 16 tornadoes took place. The next image was taken on July 21, and show marks on the ground similar to scratch marks on a surface.

According to NASA, the tornadoes were both rated EF-4 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, entailing that the storms carried violent winds ranging from 166 to 200 miles per hour. One of the tornadoes passed through the small town of Pilger, which has a population of 355. The storm leveled the town, killing a five-year-old girl as well as an elderly man.

Sea Shepherd says 176 marine mammals had been . killed this season, including bottlenose, spotted, striped and risso's . dolphins. Exact monitoring is difficult, with fishermen erecting tarpaulins over their killing area and blocking access to the cove. The dolphins will be uncomfortably oblivious of the impending doom some of them will suffer at the hands of the fishermen. They are captured around four to five at a time until enough of them are collected for 'selection' Treatment: The fishermen brutally kill the dolphins they do not set free or capture using a sharp spike or spear . Cramped: The cove does not provide much space for the dolphins to swim, forcing them to huddle up in groups . Yoko Ono's comments were . welcomed on Monday by fugitive eco-activist Paul Watson, who said he . hoped it would help convince Tokyo to put a halt to the practice.

"By . Bianca London . Her commitment to her son's career is legendary. She gave him his first . tennis racket when he was two and coached him until he was 11. She even sacrificed her marriage to follow him around the world. So after watching her son in an epic display of resilience, . perseverance and sheer guts to become the first British man to . win Wimbledon since 1936, it was no surprise that Judy Murray wanted to celebrate in style. And the 53 year old, who has often been criticised for being one of the toughest women in tennis, couldn't hide her happiness as she dazzled watching her son Andy collect the Gentlemen's Singles Trophy during the Winner's Ball last night. Dazzling: Judy Murray showed off her glamorous side in a glittering Jenny Packham gown during the Winner's Ball last night . While we are more accustomed to seeing her dressed head-to-toe in sports attire cheering her son on courtside, Judy showed off her more glamorous and feminine side at the InterContinental Park Lane Hotel last night. Dressed in a £1680 floor-length glittering nude and blue haze gown by British designer Jenny Packham - a favourite of the Duchess of Cambridge - Judy Murray dazzled as she celebrated with her son. Speaking to BBC Scotland ahead of the event, she said: 'I've just been selecting my dress for the champions' ball and I've never worn a long dress in my life before, . 'But I will be tonight, with great pride.' Glowing: Andy's 53-year-old mother was practically glowing with pride as she celebrated her son's long-awaited victory . New look: Judy said that she had never worn a long dress in her life before but had selected this dazzling number because it was a very special occasion . Despite the emotional turmoil of the day, Judy practically glowed she she joined Andy and girlfriend Kim Sears at the glamorous event. Judy is often criticised as being tough and cold, but her son's long-awaited victory brought out a different side to his usually stony-faced mother. As Andy Murray sank to his knees in shock at his victory against Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon yesterday, the cameras cut to Judy and we witnessed her give way to the emotion of the moment as she turned her back and burst into tears. Proud: She is his number one fan and has followed him around the world in his tennis career so it is no wonder that Judy couldn't hide her smile last night as she posed with son Andy . Proud parents: Andy Murray (C) hugs his parents Judy Murray and William Murray during the Wimbledon Championships 2013 Winners Ball at InterContinental Park Lane Hotel . He nearly committed an equally historic . faux-pas at the moment of triumph, having clambered up into the stands . to embrace his coach, physio, dietician, fitness guru, girlfriend, best . friend, father and a few chums along the way. On his way down again, he . remembered that there was someone else seated just behind the players’ box. To arguably the loudest cheers of the entire day, he returned to hug his mum. His girls: Judy Murray (R) and Kim Sears enjoy the party to celebrate Andy's biggest victory yet . Hugs all round: Judy hugs presenter John Inverdale at the champions dinner as she shows off her more glamorous side . Pure happiness: Judy couldn't hide her happiness after such a tense day watching her son . Home time: Judy looked tired after such along day celebrating her son's win. She has watched every single one of his matches and even sacrificed her marriage to follow him around the world . Judy has served as his greatest support system throughout his tennis career. She famously loves mothering Andy, once even rushing out to buy thermometers to check his bathwater was . exactly 37 degrees, as prescribed by his physio. Once, . when he didn't have the right shoes for a big match in Miami, she flew . out from Britain with a new pair. 'What else could I do?' she said. Sadly, her commitment took its toll on her relationship with husband Willie - the pair split when Andy was just nine. At . the time, she said: 'I was away a lot and then you're coaching until . quite late in the evening. Your domestic life gets hit for six.' Relief: Judy shows her emotion as Andy ends 77 years of waiting for a British champion and kisses the Wimbledon men's trophy yesterday after defeating world No 1 Novak Djokovic in straight sets . Don't forget mum! Andy Murray kisses his mum after winning against Serbia's Novak Djokovic, it was an emotional moment and Judy shed tears of joy . In June 2005, during Andy's . Wimbledon debut, she was nicknamed 'Spy Mum' after using a video camera . to film Andy's opponent George Bastl for him to analyse. As well as supporting Andy from the . stands as he became the first British champion since Fred Perry . in 1936, Judy even spent time with her son at his home in Surrey . during the tournament. Speaking ahead of the big day, she said: 'The grass court season is the time when he can actually stay at home. 'He lives about half an hour away from Wimbledon - so he has that luxury of being able to stay at home. Support: Andy Murray's mother Judy has been there all the way for her son. Here she . arrived at day one of Wimbledon Tennis Championships 2013 to support her . son . By his side: Judy spent time with her son at his home in Surrey during the tournament . 'It is nice to be able to spend a bit of family time and be hi his own surroundings with his girlfriend and his dogs.' Judy says Andy's skills originate from the homemade games she played with her sons when they were growing up. She explained: 'They're all games we made up when Jamie and Andy were small. 'I had two boisterous young boys at home . and not much money, so we were always challenging ourselves to find . things that we could do when the weather's bad, often it was things we . could do inside, without spending a lot of money. 'Biscuit tin lid cereal boxes, for example. We played that with cereal boxes for the net, biscuit lids for bats and a ping pong ball. His girls: Judy, who watches her sons every match and says it doesn't get any easier, is close with his girlfriend Kim Sears (pictured here in 2010 and 2009 with Kim) Support system: Judy is her son's number one fan and has supported him since day one. Here, she is pictured at his first ever Wimbledon tennis championships in June 2005 . 'It's all simple stuff and you don't need to go out and spend any money or book a pitch to do it.' It was these activities that contributed to Andy and Jamie's success on the court, according to Judy. 'I believe that doing so many fun activities when the kids were small helped to develop good hand-eye coordination. 'Andy, as well as being a really good tennis player, was also an extremely good football player. 'Up to age 14 he was as much football as . tennis and he opportunity to do something with Rangers when he was 14 - . that's when he made the decision to go into tennis. 'And Jamie was a pre-handicapper at golf when he was 16.' Doting: Judy famously loves mothering Andy and even used to rush out to buy thermometers to check his bathwater was exactly 37 degrees, as prescribed by his physio . The little things: Judy credits her son's success to the games she used to play with him when he was younger, which she maintains improved his hand-eye coordination . Her influence is clearly hugely important on her son and he wrote in his autobiography: 'My mum’s the one person who gets me, who understands me really well.' When Murray lost to Roger Federer in the 2010 Australian Open final, he apologised to his mother, to which she replied: 'Andy, don’t ever tell me you are sorry. Have you any idea how great that is for me, watching you on one of the best courts in the world, playing against the best player of all time? Your time will come, never forget that.' And yesterday it did, and his number one fan was there to help him celebrate the greatest day of his life in style.","Andy Murray celebrated historic win with family and girlfriend at Ball in London .

"By . Leon Watson . It's the news they've been waiting for... Next time you hear a child complaining that their science and maths homework is a waste of time, they might have a point. That's the conclusion of research carried on schoolchildren to find out what difference extra study at home makes. Waste of time? A study by the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, found more homework assignments didn't translate into better grades . It found homework doesn't necessarily help children to get better grades, but may help them get better standardised test scores. Researchers from the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, U.S., looked at transcripts and data for more than 18,000 tenth grade students nationwide. Their findings show more homework assignments didn't translate into better grades. Co-author Robert Tai, associate professor of science education at the university's Curry School of Education, said: 'The more time students spend on homework, it's not clear that they are getting better grades or better test scores. 'What we are concerned with is that homework is just being assigned rather than being used to integrate what's going on in the classroom.' The study isn't suggesting all homework is bad, especially when it comes to maths. The study looked at transcripts and data for more than 18,000 tenth grade students nationwide . 'When it comes to math, what we found is that there is a bit of a sweet spot,' Prof Tai said. 'Students that were spending about a half an hour on math homework were reporting that their grades and test scores were actually better.' Prof Tai says the study is a wake up call for educators. 'Teachers need to be much more clear about why they are assigning homework and what the homework is for,' he said. 'If teachers aren't really incorporating homework into their teaching, it's unclear there is any type of benefit at all and it actually may end up hurting students.' The study points to factors like class participation and attendance as better indicators of students performance. In conclusion, the authors suggest more research be done on the form and function of homework assignments. 'In today's current educational environment, with all the activities taking up children's time both in school and out of school, the purpose of each homework assignment must be clear and targeted,' Prof Tai said. 'With homework, more is not better.'","University of .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Four ambulances and an air ambulance were rushed to Pembroke School in west Wales after seven pupils fainted . Seven schoolchildren were rushed to hospital today after taking a legal high during their lunch break. Four ambulances and an air ambulance were called to treat the teenagers when they started to faint after returning to classes at Pembroke Comprehensive School in west Wales. Detectives are now examining samples of the unnamed drug. A Dyfed-Powys Police spokesperson said: 'The ambulance service informed us of an incident they were dealing with at Pembroke Comprehensive School. 'A group of pupils had become unwell. 'Officers attended the scene and established that a number of pupils were affected. 'Some were treated at the scene and . released but others were conveyed to the Accident and Emergency . department at Withybush Hospital in Haverfordwest as a precaution. 'None are believed to be in a life threatening condition. 'Early indications are that the group may have reacted to a type of legal high.' The incident comes just a month after . one of the Prime Minister's most senior drugs advisors said children . need more lessons on the dangers of legal substances. Parents of the 1,500 pupils at the comprehensive school have been informed of the incident and urged to warn their children against such drugs. Police said none of the children were in a life-threatening condition. A Pembrokeshire County Council spokesman said the school had now launched an independent investigation into the legal high incident. He said: 'It appears these students have taken some kind of legal high. 'Seven felt unwell and were conveyed to Withybush Hospital. 'Ambulances attended as a precaution. 'The incident happened just after 2pm. Their condition is not life-threatening. Parents have been informed. It comes a month after a senior government drugs advisor warned children are 'uneducated' about drugs . 'The school is now launching its own investigation into the matter.' Last month, Professor Simon Gibbons, a member of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, said a broader drugs education was needed . The father-of two said his elder daughter, aged ten, was already ‘starting to be aware of some of these materials’. His comments raised concerns among parents who do not want their children exposed to such advice or who would prefer to handle the issue at home, with many calling for immediate action. Campaigners blame more than 50 deaths a year on legal highs, including Adam Hunt, 18, of Southampton, and Hester Stewart, 21, of Brighton. Ministers have already introduced bans on some legal highs, including mephedrone — known as meow meow — NBOMe and Benzofury. A ban on synthetic stimulant mephedrone came into force across the UK in 2010. The drug is now a Class B substance, along with its associated compounds. Earlier this year the Mail revealed that there had been a huge surge in the number of deaths from other legal highs. Ninety seven people were found dead with the substances in their system in 2012, up from 12 in 2009. It means the toll has risen by eight times in three years. In around two-thirds of cases, the post-mortem examination established that the legal high was the direct cause of death. A Home Office-appointed review is expected to report in late spring. A new national curriculum being introduced in September states that pupils in year six at primary school – those aged ten and 11 – must be taught to ‘recognise the impact of diet, exercise and drugs and lifestyle on the way their bodies function’. It states ‘pupils should learn how to keep their bodies healthy and how their bodies might be damaged – including how some drugs and other substances can be harmful to the human body’. They should also explore ‘the relationship between diet, exercise, drugs, lifestyle and health’. Although Personal, Social and Health Education lessons remain non-compulsory, the Department for Education recommends schools use them to expand the knowledge pupils get in science classes. Guidance endorsed by ministers says primary pupils should be taught ‘which, why and how commonly available substances and drugs (including alcohol and tobacco) could damage their immediate and future health and safety, that some are legal, some are restricted and some are illegal to own, use and supply to others’. Further guidance commissioned by ministers contains a series of standards for delivering drugs education in schools, including that ‘the situations, language and images are appropriate for pupils’ maturity, understanding and knowledge’. Education minister Liz Truss answered a Parliamentary written question last month on drugs education in schools. Asked by Tory MP Andrew Rosindell what steps the DfE was taking ‘to ensure children are taught about the harmful effects of drugs’, she said: ‘Pupils will learn about the effects of drugs on behaviour and health as part of the new science national curriculum from September 2014. 'Teachers can also cover the issue through PSHE lessons.’","The teenagers started to faint in class at Pembroke Comprehensive .

"By . Associated Press . Citigroup will pay $7 billion to settle an investigation into risky subprime mortgages, the type that helped fuel the financial crisis. The agreement announced Monday comes weeks after talks between the sides broke down, prompting the government to warn that it would sue the New York investment bank. The bank had offered to pay less than $4 billion, a sum substantially less than what the Justice Department was asking for. Scroll down for video . Citigroup will pay $7 billion to settle an investigation into risky subprime mortgages, the type that helped fuel the financial crisis . The settlement stems from the sale of . securities made up of subprime mortgages, which fueled both the housing . boom and bust that triggered the Great Recession at the end of 2007. Citigroup and other banks downplayed the risks of subprime mortgages when packaging and selling them to mutual funds, investment trusts, pensions, as well as other banks and investors. The securities, which contained so-called residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations, plunged in value when the housing market collapsed in 2006 and 2007. Those losses triggered a financial crisis that pushed the economy into the worst recession since the 1930s. The bank separately agreed in April to pay $1.13 billion to settle claims by investors seeking that the lender buy back billions of dollars in residential mortgage-backed securities. In the deal announced Monday, Citigroup will make a $4 billion civil monetary payment to the Justice Department, and another $500 million in compensatory payments to state attorney's general and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The bank will provide $2.5 billion in consumer relief, which will include financing for construction and preservation of affordable housing, as well as principal reduction and forbearance for residential loans. 'The comprehensive settlement announced today with the U.S. Department of Justice, state attorneys general, and the FDIC resolves all pending civil investigations related to our legacy RMBS and CDO underwriting, structuring and issuance activities,' said CEO Michael Corbat. 'We also have now resolved substantially all of our legacy RMBS and CDO litigation.' Citigroup shares were up on Monday's opening trading bell despite the massive settlement . The bank will take a pre-tax charge of about $3.8 billion during its second quarter. Shares of Citigroup Inc. rose more than 1 percent before the opening bell Monday. The Citigroup settlement comes months after a similar — but much larger — deal between the Justice Department and JPMorgan Chase & Co., the nation's biggest bank. After months of negotiations, the bank last year agreed to pay $13 billion after an investigation into toxic mortgage-backed securities. As part of the deal, which included settlements with New York, California and other states, JPMorgan agreed to provide $4 billion in relief to homeowners affected by the bad loans. The bank also acknowledged that it misrepresented the quality of its securities to investors. That deal was seen as a possible template for settlement with Citigroup and Bank of America Corp., which was accused in a government lawsuit last summer of failing to disclose risks and misleading investors in its sale of $850 million of mortgage-linked securities. The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a related lawsuit against Bank of America.","Settlement stems from sale of securities made up of subprime mortgages .

"By . Rosemarie Lentini . A Mexican national deported from the US four times has been arrested in Texas for allegedly molesting a nine-year-old girl and stealing her underpants. Israel Andrade, 35, allegedly broke into the Springtown home early Saturday morning and groped the girl in her sleep, before motioning for her to join him in a bedroom. Andrade's arrest and the multiple failed attempts to keep him out of the country has sparked calls for tighter security at the US-Mexico border, with local sheriffs peititoning the federal government for more resources. Scroll down for video . Charged: Mexican national Israel Andrade, 35 (pictured), was arrested for allegedly breaking into a Texas home Saturday morning and molesting a little girl before fleeing with stolen goods . CBS reported the girl told Parker County Sheriff’s deputies she was roused from sleep by a man groping her private areas. She had been sleeping on the couch with her siblings. She said the man, who spoke in broken English, beckoned her to follow him into a bedroom where he broke into the home. He fled when the girl ran screaming to her parents' room. According to CBS, the girl's mother was forced to drive to a convenience store to call police as the suspect allegedly stole the family's cell phones and computer. Investigators found Andrade at a relative’s house about a mile away, where he'd been staying for about 30 days after returning from Mexico. Police said he was found sleeping on one of the stolen phones. Scene: Israel Andrade, 35 (top right corner) is accused of breaking into a home in Springtown, Texas and assaulting a little girl . According to Dallas News, police also found two pairs of the child’s underpants stuffed in the suspect's jeans and a pair of tennis shoes with a tread pattern matching footprints at the girl's home. Andrade was charged with burglary of a habitation with intent to commit another felony, indecency with a child by sexual contact - a first-degree felony. Immigration and Naturalization Service records obtained by the sheriff's office found Andrade had been deported from the US in July 2003, February 2004, September 2009 and December 2010 .

'Our border Sheriffs and the Texas Department of Public Safety are doing a phenomenal job with the current laws and available resources,' Fowler said in a statement.

"Arnold Schwarzenegger has insisted he was not responsible for exposing prisoners to a lifelong and crippling disease while he was the governor of California . Arnold Schwarzenegger has insisted he was not responsible for exposing prisoners to a lifelong and crippling disease while he was the governor of California. The Terminator actor, along with a number of other officials, is being sued by dozens of current and former inmates who allege they contracted Valley Fever while being held in prisons in central California. The illness, caused by a soil-borne fungus, can cause skin lesions and brain damage in sufferers. The inmates, who claim officials knew of the dangers of keeping inmates in the prisons, are now seeking money to cover medical care and damages. But in new legal documents, Schwarzenegger has claimed he is not responsible for an outbreak of the illness at Pleasant Valley State Prison, TMZ has reported. Inmates have accused Schwarzenegger of being indifferent to the risks, a charge the former governor refutes, saying he even held a press conference acknowledging the issue. Schwarzenegger has also said others were responsible for solving the problems while he was running the state, TMZ has reported. In court documents, the inmates allege the defendants 'knew that placing inmates in prisons where the prevalence of spore-laden soils was a known hazard - where Valley Fever was already occurring at epidemic rates - posed an unacceptable risk of irreparable harm to them.' The document goes on to say: 'Yet Defendants not only placed Plaintiffs in harm's way, they also failed to implement even rudimentary measures recommended by the correctional authority's own medical experts to protect Plaintiffs from the disease.' The current Governor of California, Jerry Brown, is also among those who are being sued. In new legal documents, Schwarzenegger has claimed he is not responsible for an outbreak of the illness at Pleasant Valley State Prison (pictured) In February, the federal health care agency reported that three employees at two California prisons had died in recent years and 103 others were made sick by Valley Fever. Employees at Avenal and Pleasant Valley state prisons near Fresno appear more likely to contract the condition than adults in the surrounding population, the report by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health said. The institute found that the employee deaths and illnesses occurred between January 2009 and last June. The state requested the report after . nearly three-dozen inmate deaths and hundreds of hospitalizations at the . prisons were blamed on the fungus that causes the illness. In February, the federal health care agency reported that employees at Avenal and Pleasant Valley state prisons near Fresno appear more likely to contract the condition than adults in the surrounding population (file picture) A federal judge ordered the state to move nearly 2,600 inmates to other prisons last fall because those inmates were deemed to be more susceptible to the fungus, which grows naturally in the soil in the Central Valley and other dry locations such as Arizona and Mexico. Pleasant Valley State Prison in Fresno County had 3,358 inmates and more than 1,300 guards and other employees last May. The institute confirmed 65 valley fever cases among the prison's employees over the 3 1/2-year period of its study, including two employee deaths. Avenal State Prison in Kings County had 4,538 inmates and more than 1,500 employees last May. The institute confirmed 38 valley fever cases there, with one death. It had an average rate of 511 cases per 100,000, higher than the average of 110 cases per 100,000 adults in Kings County.","Former governor of California is among a number of officials being sued by current and former inmates .

"By . Associated Press . Former President George W. Bush has had his left knee partially replaced — seven weeks after having the same procedure on his right knee. Bush's spokesman Freddy Ford said the procedure on Bush's left knee took place Saturday at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. Ford says the 68-year-old ex-president and his wife Laura were on their way back to Dallas on Monday morning. Former President George W.

"By . Chris Pleasance . Tahir Alam, Muslim Council of Britain activist, could now be removed from his post as Ofsted is expected to impose special measures on six Birmingham schools, three of which are run by him . Six secular schools at the centre of a plot to introduce hardline Islamic teaching into classrooms are to be placed in special measures. It has been reported that Ofsted inspectors will rate the schools 'inadequate' after snap inspections this week, which usually leads to a school being placed in special measures, allowing officials to remove senior managers or close the school. Inspectors were ordered in to the Birmingham schools after a 'Trojan Horse' letter was uncovered last month detailing a plot by hardline Muslims to force moderate and secular headteachers from their posts and install extreme Islamic teachers in their place. Today a report published in The Telegraph alleges that Park View, Golden Hillock, Nansen, Oldknow and Saltley schools will be rated inadequate, the lowest possible score, while Alston school is already in special measures. If the new . Ofsted investigation does place the schools in special measures, Tahir . Alam, who is also governor of Highfield school, is almost certain to be . removed from his post. Mr . Alam, an activist for the hardline Muslim Council of Britain, is alleged to be at the centre of the trjan Horse plot, but has . denied the allegations, calling them a 'fabrication'. According to the Ofsted report, a further nine schools Springfield, Adderley, Regents Park, Highfield, Gracelands, Ladypool, Marlborough, Montgomery and Waverley will be given the second lowest rank of 'requiring improvement'. A letter from Adderley school to parents yesterday confirmed the school had been subjected to a 'malicious and targeted' attempt to oust senior staff. In its statement to parents, Adderley Primary's governing body confirmed that several headteachers in the city had  faced pressure to resign from their posts. The school, which is also embroiled in a fraud inquiry into allegedly fake resignation letters, said: 'Many of you will now be aware that a number of headteachers across Birmingham have come forward and confirmed that they have experienced malicious and targeted campaigns to remove them and that this issue is not unique to the leadership of Adderley Primary School. 'The seriousness of this issue has now been taken up by the Department for Education who have appointed a new education adviser responsible for investigating this matter thoroughly. 'Birmingham City Council have also appointed a former head teacher, Ian Kershaw, as Birmingham's chief adviser to assist in a wider investigation.' In a picture taken inside Park View school in 2008, boys and girls appear to have been segregated in an assembly. The school has always maintained segregation was voluntary, but an investigation found it was enforced by teachers . Park View school, along with its two sister schools Golden Hillock and Nansen, have bee rated 'inadequate' by Ofsted inspectors, along with Oldknow and Statley . The update for parents concluded: 'Attempts have been made at Adderley to destabilise the school by a very small but well organised group of individuals. 'The governors, headteacher, senior leadership team and staff have been robust in ensuring that Adderley remains a multi-cultural school providing a safe and positive learning environment for all of our 630 children.' Four former staff members at the primary school were arrested on Thursday and have been bailed pending further inquiries into allegedly forged resignation letters. Of the 17 schools investigated by Ofsted in connection with the plot, so far only one has been given a clean bill of health though another report is still to be completed. Meanwhile a Department for Education (DfE) probe, lead by Peter Clarke, the former head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorism unit, is thought to be looking into 25 schools in the area. Yesterday The Telegraph revealed the DfE investigation found boys and girls had been forcibly segregated during lessons, Christian students had been left to teach themselves religious education, and any discussion of intimacy or the menstrual cycle had been banned in some classes. The probe into Park View School, Golden Hillock and Nansen primary school found that Shiekh Shady al-Suleiman, a known al-Qaeda sympathiser who has previously said gay people should be stoned to death and espoused anti-semetic views, was also invited to speak to children. A report from the Department for Education leaked yesterday found that pupils at Park View were forcibly segregated and Christian students were left to tech themselves. The headteacher, Lindsey Clark (pictured) was sidelined and eventually resigned . Pupils at two of the schools said the theory of evolution was only covered 'briefly' in biology, sex education was banned, and lessons on the arts and literature severely restricted or abandoned. Despite these restrictions, Arabic lessons were compulsory for all students. Pupils were also encouraged to begin and end lessons with  prayer, and loudspeakers were used to broadcast calls to prayer. The report said headteachers at the schools were marginalised, with Park View, Golden Hillock and Nansen in reality being run by Tahir Alam, who ran the board of governors. The headteacher of Park View, Lindsey Clark, resigned last month after being reduced to a 'figurehead' within the school, despite gaining the school an 'outstanding' Ofsted rating. In a statement to Mail Online, the Park View Education Trust said: 'Just two years ago Park View was the first Academy to be rated 'Outstanding' in all categories under the new Ofsted inspection regime. 'It took more than 10 years to build the school to its Outstanding levels, from a situation where children were being failed and the school was in special measures. 'Park View is now the most successful school in England serving its social group - that is, with 72% of pupils on free school meals. 'If the inspectors who carried out both inspections at Park View Academy have ignored these achievements then we have to conclude that they are working to a different set of criteria than is normally used for an Ofsted inspection.' However, the spokesman refused to comment on the current allegations, saying only that they did not recongise reports that some of the schools would close. A spokesman for Ofsted refused to comment on the report, but yesterday a spokesman for the Department for Education said: 'The allegations made in relation to some schools in Birmingham are very serious and we are investigating all evidence put to us in conjunction with Ofsted, Birmingham City Council and the police. 'It is absolutely vital these investigations are carried out impartially, without pre-judgment. Birmingham City Council is also investigating 15 schools, though the DfE is thought to be frustrated with attempts by the council to play down what is happening in the schools.","Schools investigated by Department for Education, Ofsted and Birmingham City Council over alleged plot to introduce extreme Islamic teaching .

"By . Associated Press . When openly gay police chief Crystal Moore was fired by a mayor who condemned her lifestyle as 'questionable,' she feared her two decade career in law enforcement in this town was over. Then, this conservative, small town rebelled. The people of Latta, who voted overwhelmingly for a state amendment banning gay marriage eight years ago, turned against the mayor, stripped him of his powers and the town council rehired Moore. They said her dedication to the town mattered more than her sexual orientation. Scroll down for video . Chief: Crystal Moore stands beside her police SUV on Thursday, July 10, 2014, in Latta . Residents remembered Moore's civic spirit from as far back as 1989, when Hurricane Hugo tore through Latta. She was a high school student working part time as a police dispatcher, and helped cut downed tree limbs to clean up the debris. This February, when an ice storm crippled the town and left it without power for days, Moore piled her officers in her SUV and checked on as many people as she could. 'That's Crystal. All she does is help people. I don't get why he fired her. Maybe it's the ignorant people who talk the loudest. She was the same great Crystal yesterday as she is today, and she'll be the same person tomorrow,' said lifelong Latta resident Dottie Walters. Mayor Earl Bullard vehemently denied that he fired Moore because she was gay. Instead, he said she was dismissed for 'sheer insubordination' during the three months he was her boss. Moore said she hadn't received a single reprimand during her career until Bullard presented her with seven the day she was fired in April. Word of her termination spread fast in this tobacco hub of about 1,400 people, just off Interstate 95. About two dozen people gathered at her office in support on the day she was let go. The support for Moore grew when Town Councilman Jarett Taylor started secretly recording his conversations with the mayor, which is legal in South Carolina. Taylor said he learned not to trust the mayor because he would tell him something, and later deny he ever said it. Discussion: Latta Police Chief Crystal Moore talks with friends at a fundraiser for a youth softball team on Thursday. Residents of Latta rallied around Moore after the mayor fired her and mentioned he didn't like she was gay, even voting to strip the mayor of his power so Moore could get her job back . In a conversation released to reporters after Moore was fired, the mayor said: 'I'd much rather have somebody who drank and drank too much taking care of my child than I had somebody whose lifestyle is questionable around children, because that ain't the damn way it's supposed to be.' Bullard, who has avoided reporters for much of the past three months, told The Associated Press that was him on the tape. He offered no apologies. 'I don't like the homosexual ways portrayed in front of children,' Bullard told AP by telephone Thursday. 'You can't explain to a 5-year-old why another child has two mommies or two daddies.' Since the story made headlines, Bullard said he had received a stack of hate mail that was 'probably an inch-and-a-half thick.' Within days of Moore's termination, the town council passed a vote of confidence in her. They also set up an election that would strip the mayor of his power and give them more authority, including the ability to hire the police chief. Moore, who played softball at Latta High School, walked up and down the streets for days before the vote, explaining her side of the story and calling for change. Last month, 69 percent of 475 voters approved of taking the mayor's power away. Now essentially a figurehead, it's not clear what he is going to do next. He ran unopposed in 2013 and still has three years left on his term. Reinstated: When Moore returned to work June 30, people honked their car horns and gave her thumbs up as she drove around in her police SUV . When Moore returned to work June 30, people honked their car horns and gave her thumbs up as she drove around in her police SUV, according to television reports. When an AP reporter rode around with her recently, nearly everyone waved as she drove by. 'Crystal is a good chief and she loves this town,' said Taylor, the councilman. 'It made me proud of my town to see everybody come out for her the way they did.' Latta is a blink-and-you-miss-it town that started as a train depot and grew into a tobacco hub. Many people pass it on their way to Myrtle Beach, which is about 50 miles away. The only rainbow in town is on the Carolina Kidz daycare center. Moore's firing turned her into an unlikely activist. Before, she would bring her partner to civic festivals, but avoided gay pride events because she didn't want to draw attention to herself. Now she travels about once a week to talk to gay groups and encourage laws to stop discrimination against homosexuals. South Carolina does not have a statewide ban on firing people because of their sexual orientation. 'I think things are going to change, like they did in the civil rights movement,' Moore said. State unemployment officials sided with Moore, voting she was fired without cause and eligible for back pay and benefits for the two months she didn't have a job. The fight left Moore with nearly $20,000 in legal bills. About $8,000 has been pledged from people through a Facebook site, but that still leaves a lot of debt for someone who makes less than $40,000 a year running a 10-officer department. So the town is arranging a yet-to-be determined fundraiser, Moore said. 'It's just remarkable,' she said. 'I can't ever thank this place enough.'","The people of Latta, South Carolina rehired fire police chief Crystal Moore after she was fired by Mayor Earl Bullard .

"By . Misty White Sidell . The beloved children’s cartoon Madeline celebrates its 75th anniversary this year, and to commemorate the occasion, the New York Historical Society is staging a retrospective of the work of its creator Ludwig Bemelmans. More than 100 of his pieces, including original drawings from the Madeline books, are displayed in Madeline in New York: The Art of Ludwig Bemelmans – which marks his first solo show in close to 50 years. Madeline, a series of six books (the first edition of which was published in 1939), is beloved worldwide for its expression of sweet sentiments and strong will. A classic: Ludwig Bemelmans's career is celebrated in a new exhibit at the New York Historical Society, where his drawings, including those from Madeline, are on display (pictured, 'Madeline at the Paris Flower Market', an oil on canvas from 1955) Singular approach: In the Madeline series, the title protagonist is a schoolgirl in Paris, and is shown escorted by a religious headmaster (pictured, a dummy cover by Bemelmans for the title Madeline and the Bad Hat c. 1956, pen, ink, watercolor, and gouache) Original works: the exhibit includes original paintings from the first Madeline, like this page showing the schoolgirls in mid-winter (dated, 1939, watercolor and gouache) The Caldecott Honor-winning book follows the life of title protagonist Madeline – the small, singularly red-headed student enrolled in a Catholic boarding school in Paris – alongside her fellow classmates, schoolmaster Miss Clavel, and neighborhood friend Pepito. The first book famously starts with an illustration depicting Madeline and her fellow students filing behind their schoolmaster, accompanied by the inimitable intro line: ‘In an old house in Paris that was covered in vines, lived twelve little girls in two straight lines ...’ The Madeline character, as Bemelmans dreamed her to be, wore an endearing school uniform of a yellow sailor hat and blue overcoat – standing out from the rest of her classmates not only because of her fiery hair, but also her feisty personality. Though the stories are based in the French capital, Madeline fans may be surprised to hear that the series is a thoroughly New York phenomenon. On the road: Madeline has since become a successful TV series as well as a feature film (pictured, a sketch from Madeline and the Gypsies, 1959) New York roots: While Madeline is based in Paris, the story was written and drawn in New York (pictured, a scene from Madeline's Rescue, 1953) Humble beginnings: Ludwig Bemelmans wrote the manuscript for Madeline on the backside of a menu at Manhattan's Pete's Tavern (pictured, a drawing from Madeline and the Bad Hat, c. 1956) Bemelmans wrote the first book in a corner booth at the famous Pete’s Tavern just off of Gramercy Park in Manhattan – an establishment that currently holds the distinction of being the longest continuously-running bar in the U.S. He scrawled the title’s manuscript on the backside of a bar menu. Though Bemelmans considered himself more of an illustrator and artist than a writer, he did have unique prophecies when it came to catering to his literary audience. He thought that children’s books should possess a certain degree of intelligence and was once quoted as saying: ‘We are writing for children, but not for idiots.’ The Austria-Hungary native, born in 1898, actually became a U.S. citizen in 1918 and lived the majority of his adult life in New York – where he died at the age of 64 in 1962. Visitors to the city’s famous Bemelmans bar – located inside the Carlyle Hotel on the Upper East Side – especially privy to the author’s affinity for New York. Defining points: While Madeline and her schoolmates all dressed the same, the title character stood out for her fiery hair and feisty spirit . Fearless: Madeline held a fearless spirit, and would help save her friends from trouble (pictured, a drawing from Madeline and the Bad Hat, c. 1956) The bar is blanketed in Bemelmans sketches (Madeline included) – from the wallpaper to the tiny lamps adorning each cocktail table (two of which are on display at the NYHS) – because of an exchange the illustrator bartered in return for a year and a half worth’s free stay in the historic hotel. Carlyle associates were so pleased with Bemelmans work that they also named the bar after him. Bemelmans enjoyed success as a privately-commissioned illustrator - proof of which is also on display. Among these relics are two remarkable panels that Bemelmans created for the walls of a playroom inside Aristotle Onassis’s yacht The Christina (commissioned in 1953). Additional works also on display include the many cartoons that Bemelmans created for magazines including Town & Country, Harper’s Bazaar, and The New Yorker.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A body found off the shores of a California beach is that of an 18-year-old cliff diver who was reported missing after jumping into the water on Wednesday afternoon, law enforcement officials confirmed on Sunday. Joseph Sanchez was last seen jumping from a cliff at Abalone Cove Shoreline Park about 40 miles south of Los Angeles. According to a friend who witnessed the jump, Sanchez jumped in but was knocked into rocks in a cove by the strong surf before the water swept him into a sea cave. About 11:30 a.m. Sunday, his body was found inside a sea cave just 50 yards from where he was last seen jumping. Sad: Joseph Sanchez (left) died after his body was thrown into rocks by a violent surf while he was cliff jumping with friends . Rescue: Rescuers looked for days for Sanchez's body, often battling massive waves and strong currents . Search: Sanchez's family and friends setup camp at a cliff overlooking where he was last seen as they aided in the recovery effort . The body was first seen by one of Sanchez's relatives, many of whom had been camped up on a cliff overlooking the cove where Sanchez was last seen jumping since Wednesday, KTLA reports . The family had been assisting law enforcement in looking for the teen. Inspiration Point, where Sanchez and his friends had been cliff jumping, has become a popular spot for thrill-seeking teens.

"By . Alasdair Glennie . and Hugo Gye . Jeremy Paxman has admitted that Newsnight viewers would sometimes do better to turn off the television and go to bed rather than watch the programme. The anchor of BBC2's flagship news broadcast revealed that on some nights he wanted to say, 'Not much happened today' - but added that he would feel guilty about betraying his colleagues if he did so. The presenter's comments came during a wide-ranging interview in which Mr Paxman suggested that the current 'cosseted' generation might benefit from National Service, and said that he feels guilty about never serving in the Armed Forces. Nothing on? Jeremy Paxman admits that sometimes he wants to tell Newsnight viewers to stop watching . Last year, Newsnight's editor made headlines by tweeting that one of the guests on his own show was 'boring snoring'. And . Mr Paxman appears to support that view some of the time, telling the . Radio Times that on slow news days it is hardly worth watching the . programme. 'News is not . easily predicted and a certain amount of time has to be filled,' the . 63-year-old said. 'I'd often like to see the presenter say, ""Not much . happened today, so I'd go to bed if I were you."" 'I've . often felt like that on Newsnight. I wouldn't do it, because it's . disloyal to colleagues who have slaved long and hard to make bricks . without straw. That's the nature of journalism.' However, . the veteran broadcaster denied the suggestion that he fails to hide his . boredom on camera, saying: 'I can't help my face. It's long, and I can . do nothing about it.' And . he dismissed criticism that the programme has dumbed down thanks to . recent segments such as a long interview with comedian Russell Brand and . presenter Kirsty Wark dancing to Thriller on Halloween. Controversy: The presenter's interview with comedian Russell Brand was criticised by some viewers . Reflecting . on the furore cause by his decision to grow a beard last summer, Mr . Paxman said he was ‘naïve’ not to expect the attention, adding it was . ‘absurd, but funny’. In . September last year, Newsnight editor Ian Katz caused controversy when . he accidentally sent out a Twitter message describing one guest, Labour . frontbencher Rachel Reeves, as 'boring snoring'. The . show boss, who joined after the previous editor was forced to resign . over the Jimmy Savile scandal, apologised for the blunder. In . the Radio Times interview, Mr Paxman revealed his guilt at having such a . privileged life while his parents’ generation had to fight in the . Second World War. The presenter - whose father Keith served in the North Atlantic convoys - said conscription and National Service taught the importance of duty, whereas modern generations are ‘cosseted’ and expected to do nothing but ‘gratify themselves’. Dumbing down? Mr Paxman denied that segments such as Kirsty Wark's Thriller dance proved Newsnight's standards were slipping . He said: ‘I’d have done better for . having time in uniform. The more we see of other members of our society, . we realise we’re all human beings with the same hopes and fears. ‘I’m not arguing in favour of National Service, but I feel in awe of my parents’ generation who had to do that, and a bit guilty having such a privileged life. We’ve had it pretty easy and never been tested. ‘Obviously I’m not wishing war on anyone, but it might have been better for all of us if we’d been obliged to do something rather than choosing for ourselves. 'It’s difficult to comprehend today a society where people were expected to do things other than gratify themselves.' Reflecting on the First World War, he said: ‘It’s such an imaginative leap from our cosseted, indulged lives to something other than the achievement of personal pleasure. That’s really why people find it so hard to come to terms with the War.’ Reintroduced before the Second World War in 1939, National Service ended in the UK in 1960, when Mr Paxman was 10. 'In awe': Mr Paxman spoke of his respect for those who were obliged to fight, such as these British infantrymen at the Battle of the Somme . Asked about the case of Royal Marine Sergeant Alexander Blackman, who last December was sentenced to life for killing a wounded Taliban insurgent in 2011, the interviewer said those who have not fought for their country should not judge those who have. He said: ‘It’s not attractive seeing people who have never been in extremis passing judgment on others who have. Who knows how we’d behave? Imagine seeing your best friend blown to pieces, unable even to retrieve the body for burial.' Next week, Mr Paxman’s new TV series Britain’s Great War will start the BBC’s four-year commemoration of the First World War centenary. In recent months, the presenter has been embroiled in a row with Education Secretary Michael Gove, who said hit sitcom Blackadder perpetuated a ‘myth’ that the War was a ‘misbegotten shambles’. Mr Paxman also commented on Mr Brand, who called for a revolution and told people not to vote in a Newsnight interview . He said: ‘He’s not full of rubbish. His diagnosis of disenchantment with politicians is spot on, but his prescription won’t work. There’ll be a government whether or not you vote, so why absent yourself? 'If you don't take part, you'd better belt up and not grumble. There should be a place on the ballot paper for ""None of the above"", and if enough people filled that in, the system might start to change. 'But we're stuck with what we have and I can't think of a better one, although I find the whole green-bench pantomime at Westminster a bit silly. You and I don't have to stand on our hind legs and make speeches. We can have a civilised discussion.'","Jeremy Paxman says that sometimes Newsnight is barely worth watching .

The singer sold the apartment in 1972 to his personal physician, celebrity doctor Denton Cox, whose other clients included Judy Garland and Warhol. When Cox died his estate was sold to insurance magnate Penny Hart in 2008 for $4.5 million. Because Cox had done very little to maintain the penthouse, Hart made many renovations and turned a section of Sinatra's legendary party space into the master bedroom. The penthouse was previously on sale in 2012 by another real state group for $7.7 million.","Sinatra lived in the penthouse for 11 years, from 1961 until 1972 .

"Its website reads that Pickwick & Weller has taken an extended 'staycation', but its co-founder confirms that the brand has no plans to relaunch . By . Misty White Sidell . Pickwick & Weller, a T-shirt line which touted Ashton Kutcher as its celebrity co-founder, has closed its doors after one year in business. The e-commerce label, which is known for its simple tees for men and women, has posted a placard on its website that says ‘Pickwick & Weller is taking an extended staycation so we can come back with the best T-shirt. Ever.’ However, the brand’s co-founder Ryan Donahue has told Fashionista that the brand has no plans to relaunch. Closed for business: Though Pickwick & Weller's site says that the brand is currently seeking an overhaul, its co-founder has confirmed that the brand is closed for good . Celebrity founder: Ashton Kutcher, the celebrity co-founder and investor in Pickwick & Keller, was joined by fellow opportunists on the project - including multiple Warby Parker executives and venture capitalist firms . ‘We were unable to scale our customer acquisition to a rate that brought the necessary growth, at a cost sustainable for our business,’ Mr Donahue said. He has already obtained another job at ZenDesk – a software and IT company. Though Mr Kutcher, 36, was widely promoted as one of the label’s co-founders, it seems as of now that he fulfilled more of an investor role in the company – contributing to its initial $4million round of funding along with Warby Parker executives and various venture capitalist firms. Pickwick & Weller launched in April 2013 with a small run of T-shirt styles including V-necks, crew necks, and henleys. The shirts came with a soft, distressed finish and were fabricated in neutral colors like mustard yellow, rust, white, navy blue, and army green. Similar to Warby Parker's model, shoppers were allowed to try samples of the shirts on at home with a FedEx Fit Kit to find the silhouette and size that best suited their body before settling on one to keep. Shortly after the launch Mr Kutcher told ELLE.com: ‘T-shirts are the uniform of this generation. If you are going to wear something every day, it should be the best. Our aim is to make the best T-shirts on earth.’ The basics: The brand was known for its e-commerce-only run of T-shirts which came in simple shapes and colors . Best fit: The brand would send customers a 'fit kit' to help them find which size and shape was best for their body . Mr Donahue added to PandoDaily yesterday that the label held a conference call with its primary investors (presumably including Mr Kutcher) before reaching the unanimous decision that it was best to close the brand. ‘We had a hard conversation with our board and investors, and we mutually agreed that we gave it a good shot and it's time to move on. We built a good brand and a great product, with loyal customers, but where we really struggled was in unlocking healthy enough customer acquisition to scale it to a point where it made sense. We simply ran out of time and runway,’ he said. Mr Donahue reports that the brand did $1million of sales in its first year and had a higher customer retention rate than many of its competitors. However, its margins and growth were not large enough to succeed.","Its website reads that Pickwick & Weller has taken an extended 'staycation', but its co-founder confirms that the brand has no plans to relaunch ."
"By . Diana Mccormick . Earlier this week MailOnline reported the shocking story of 25-year-old Gemma Wood's battle to get a diagnosis of bowel cancer. Despite telling her GP she thought she had the disease, it was nine months before she was eventually sent for the tests which confirmed her worst fears. The story brought back bitter memories for Rebecca Holden, 36, a PA from west London who lives with her husband Piers, 39, and their sons, Max and Nico. She too had feared she had the disease, but was repeatedly dismissed by doctors as being neurotic. It is only through sheer persistence that she is alive today. Desperate to raise awareness that bowel cancer doesn't just affect the elderly, she has shared her story with MailOnline... Rebecca Holden (with sons Max and Nico) struggled to get her bowel cancer symptoms taken seriously and says it is only through sheer persistence she is alive today . Earlier this week MailOnline reported the shocking story of the battle 25-year-old Gemma Wood had to receive a diagnosis of bowel cancer - something Rebecca Holden knows only too well . I was absolutely furious when I read the story about Gemma Wood and her struggle to get a bowel cancer diagnosis. It is an outrage that so many doctors are still refusing to accept this disease affects young people. Anyone presenting with these symptoms should be checked out for the disease because it does affect young people. Yes, bowel cancer is almost a taboo - after all, who wants to talk about their bottom and bodily functions in great detail with total strangers? But, having read yet another article about a young person suffering from this illness, I want to share my story so that more people are aware of the symptoms and understand that it is not just the elderly who should be concerned. Mrs Holden - pictured with Max just before starting her chemotherapy - was only diagnosed after seeing a private doctor . Mrs Holden (pictured in hospital after surgery to remove her tumour in May 2011) started to suffer stomach pain and bleeding when she went to the toilet when she was pregnant with her first son, Max . I was diagnosed with bowel cancer three years ago at the age of 33 and I’m living proof that if you listen to your body and follow your instincts, you can beat this deadly disease. Back in April 2011 I had just given birth to my first son, Max, and was enjoying my first year of marriage to my husband, Piers. In the past I had always suffered from . stomach cramps and had the odd pile but I just put this down to IBS or . to the fact that I was a keen runner – running can aggravate piles. I . also had blood in my stools - seriously unsexy - but we are all a little . bit British when it comes to talking about our rear-ends, and . embarrassment aside, this is a common symptom of bowel cancer which . should never be ignored. It was only four weeks after the birth of my son via emergency caesarean section when I realised something was seriously wrong. I . had severe abdominal pain which sent me to Charing Cross A&E twice, . yet both times I was sent home without any thorough investigation. After Max's birth, Mrs Holden (pictured with her husband, Piers) repeatedly went to A&E with agonising stomach pains but each time she was fobbed off and sent home without a diagnosis . On my third visit, I refused to leave until I was given an ultrasound - this was carried out grudgingly, but revealed no abnormalities. Yet again I was sent away and told if the pain persisted to see my GP - there was nothing the hospital could do. Despite being told I was suffering from constipation by both a GP and a consultant at Charing Cross hospital in London, I was certain that I was experiencing something more serious. Because of my age I never for one second thought it could be bowel cancer, but I knew it wasn’t constipation. If it weren’t for another GP, Dr Louise Cavanagh at the Hammersmith Surgery in London, I would not be alive today. Repeated trips to A&E and my local surgery to be told there was nothing wrong did not deter me. It was only through sheer persistence and listening to my own body that I managed to get the correct diagnosis so quickly. Mrs Holden (pictured with Max during her treatment) refused to believe there was nothing wrong with her and persisted until a GP suggested that she make use of her private health insurance and see a private doctor . I will never forget the time I overheard one consultant insinuating to his colleague that given the number of times I’d been to A&E, I must be suffering from postnatal depression, and I was only in hospital to get away from my baby. I was utterly shocked. Dr Cavanagh was the only doctor to take me seriously. As I was fortunate enough to have private healthcare as a benefit from my employer, she urged me to see a colorectal surgeon for a thorough investigation. I went home and Googled ‘colorectal surgeons’ - the first name to appear was Professor Sina Dorudi at the Princess Grace Hospital in London - I contacted him immediately. At Princess Grace I was given another . ultrasound which revealed a mass in my colon, Charing Cross Hospital had . performed the very same test and had managed to miss it. Professor Dorudi then performed a colonoscopy and I was given the life changing news that it was highly likely the tumour found in my colon was cancerous. Mrs Holden is now cancer-free but is still being carefully monitored. Her surgeon told her that had she had the operation a few weeks later the cancer would already have spread around her body. Image shows her sons . It is amazing how quickly things can happen if someone is paying for it. It was hard to believe that just two months ago I had given birth, and now I was dealing with a lethal tumour. I underwent an extended right hemi-colectomy in May 2011 which removed 50 per cent of my colon and my appendix. I was lucky that the tumour was high up enough to avoid needing a colostomy bag - at the time I didn’t care what I ended up with so long as I got rid of the tumour. Professor Dorudi told me that the tumour was literally about to perforate my colon wall and it could have been a matter of weeks before the cancer spread to my entire body and the outcome would have been fatal. Mrs Holden (pictured on holiday with her husband before she was diagnosed) had to have surgery to remove part of her colon and her appendix. She also had to have intensive and gruelling chemotherapy . He suspected the tumour had been growing for around three years and it was possibly the pregnancy that aggravated the tumour to the point it caused me so much pain. It was only with my second pregnancy I realised the constant pain throughout my first was abnormal. The pregnancy was not planned but I truly believe it happened for a reason and Max and I will always have a special bond – he saved my life. Due to the tumour being so aggressive (pathology results revealed it was T4, the most severe of the four stages), I was prescribed 12 cycles of Folfox chemotherapy under the care of Dr David Propper. Whilst the chemotherapy was brutal and put me in hospital five cycles out of nine (due to adverse reactions I didn’t manage the full 12 cycles), I knew the doctors were doing all they could to ensure this destructive disease never returned. Fast forward three years and I’m cancer-free. Mrs Holden (pictured with her husband on her wedding day) says it makes her angry when she hears about other young people struggling to get a diagnosis of bowel cancer . Bowel cancer is cancer which starts in the large bowel. It is sometimes also called colon cancer or rectal cancer. Symptoms include blood in the stools, a change in bowel habits, abdominal pain and unexplained weight loss. As the disease progresses, it can also cause fatigue and breathlessness. Bowel cancer is the third most common type of cancer in England and there are about 40,000 cases diagnosed every year. Approximately 72 per cent of bowel cancer cases occur in people who are over 65. People . who are older, who eat a diet low in fibre and high in fat, those who . are overweight and those who take little exercise are most at risk. People who smoke and drink a lot of alcohol, as well as those with a family history of the disease, are also at increased risk. Source: NHS Choices . Eight months ago I gave birth to my second son, Nico, despite being told the chemotherapy could make me infertile. Piers and I feel very fortunate that we were able to have another child. I am still undergoing regular CT/MRI scans and blood tests and my last check-up came back normal. It makes me incredibly angry to read about so many other young people who have been misdiagnosed because the NHS refuses to acknowledge that young people also suffer from this form of cancer. I also question why I was not offered an MRI or CT scan when admitted to A&E, and more importantly, why the radiographer at Charing Cross failed to see the mass in my colon. If I had not had the advantage of private healthcare who knows how long it would have taken for the cancer to be discovered, by which point it would have been too late. It’s bowel cancer awareness month and if just one person reads this and it gives them the courage to go to their doctor and insist on getting the correct scans, then my own battle has not been in vain. I am not unique - bowel cancer is the third most common type of cancer in the UK and it is clearly not just the over 65s who are affected. A spokeswoman for Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust said: 'We were deeply sorry to hear of Mrs Holden’s diagnosis and that she was unhappy with the care we provided to her. 'At the time, we thoroughly investigated the care we provided. 'Our clinicians had undertaken ultrasound scans, X-rays, blood tests and an examination as well as taking Mrs Holden’s history. These were all reviewed as part of the investigation. 'Unfortunately there was nothing on clinical examination or any of the investigations which would have pointed to a diagnosis of colon cancer. 'Our patient experience is very important to us and we are sorry that Mrs Holden felt her symptoms were not being taken seriously. 'We remain keen to meet with Mrs Holden, if she wishes, to further discuss her concerns.'

"By . James Slack . and Ian Drury . An Ethiopian farmer was today given permission to use thousands of pounds of taxpayer’s money to sue the British government…for sending international aid to his homeland. The ‘farcical case’ – which has provoked fury at Westminster - will be entirely funded by the British public. The UK taxpayer must pick up the bill for both the farmer’s lawyers and a defence team from the Department for International Development. International Development Secretary Justine Greening is being forced to defend the Government over claims that her department is funding a one-party state in Ethiopia . This is on top of the £1.3billion Britain has already spent pouring aid into Ethiopia. Ministers had urged the Royal Courts of Justice to reject the case, which the farmer – who has not set foot in Britain – is fighting from abroad. But Mr Justice Warby said it raised important questions about the government’s controversial aid programme and must proceed to a full judicial review. The 33-year-old Ethiopian – granted anonymity to protect his family – says DfID is funding a one-party state in his country that has breached his human rights. He says it has propped up a regime that has driven thousands of farmers from their land and wants a declaration the policy is unlawful. He was given legal aid despite lodging the court papers from Kenya, where he is now living. It made it through the system just before Justice Secretary Chris Grayling introduces rules to prevent cases being lodged by applicants who have never set foot in the UK. The proposals, due to be enacted in August, would mean anybody seeking legal aid in civil cases must have been resident in Britain for at least 12 months. A Whitehall source said: ‘Whatever hardships this man has faced, the idea that someone without any connection to this country whatsoever can get public money to sue the Government borders on the farcical. 'When taxpayers here are still feeling the pinch after the economic crisis, it simply can't be right that their money is being dished out like this.’ A farmer, known only as ‘O’, is accusing the British Government of breaching UK human rights laws by effectively propping up the repressive regime of Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn (pictured) The case, to be heard by Mr Justice Warby, shines a light on both the huge sums being spent by DfID and the lax legal aid system which the Tories inherited from the last Labour government. The farmer, known only as ‘O’, is accusing DfID of breaching its own human rights rules by effectively propping up a repressive regime in Ethiopia – which is one of the biggest recipients of British overseas aid. Legal papers lodged earlier this year state ‘O’ was forced to leave his family and flee to a refugee camp in Kenya after being beaten and tortured trying to protect his farm. He says Ethiopian troops accompanied by officials arrived in his village in 2011 and ordered everyone to leave for a new location. Men who refused were allegedly beaten and women were raped. ‘O’ says the land seized was given to relatives of senior regime figures and foreign investors from Asia and the Middle East under the Government’s so-called ‘villagisation’ programme. An estimated four million people have been forced from their land. ‘O’ is not personally seeking compensation but wants the British Government change its aid policies and stop bankrolling brutal regimes. Ethiopian farmers eke out at living, but face having their land seized from the Government and given to foreign investors . If he is successful, ministers could be forced to review donations to other nations accused of atrocities, such as Pakistan and Rwanda. There are also fears it could open up Britain to compensation claims from around the world. International Development Secretary Justine Greening, who is named as the respondent on the court papers, denies the claims. Officials say the money spent by Britain, part of a scheme called Protection of Basic Services, did not go direct to the Ethiopian Government. Instead, the scheme – run by the World Bank – provided access to healthcare, schooling and clean water. The final cost of the case could run to tens of thousands of pounds.","Farmer claims UK aid is used to prop up repressive Ethiopian regime .

"By . Andy Dolan . Updated: . 09:00 EST, 19 December 2011 . Just days ago bookmakers dramatically slashed the odds of a white Christmas after flurries up and down the country. But yesterday forecasters said that, far from shivering under a blanket of snow this weekend, we are likely to enjoy one of the mildest festive breaks on record. A sudden switch in wind direction will cause warmer breezes to blow in from the tropics tomorrow night, the Met Office said. Winter scene: The hills of Dumfries in Scotland may be covered in snow at the moment, but forecasters say warmer weather is on the way . After bookies took a run of bets on a white Christmas, are now betting on December 25 this year being the warmest since records began. There are now odds of 1/9 that London will not see snow on December 25, while the price of the record Christmas temperature of 15.6C being beaten has been slashed from 25/1 to 12/1. 'The latest forecast suggests that a white Christmas is no longer on the cards and there is even a suggestion that we could see the hottest ever Christmas Day, which is 12/1,' said Hill's spokesman Rupert Adams. However, bookmakers are still pricing snow in Aberdeen at 2-1. And this could drive temperatures up as high as 14c (57f) in places. It means temperatures in England will swing over the next few days from just above freezing to almost double the 7.4c (45f) average maximum for December. Even parts of Scotland will see temperatures of up to 12c (54f). Though the mildest weather will be in the middle of the week, it is likely to remain warmer than usual in many areas until Christmas Day. The only snow will be on higher ground, while most of the country can expect sunny spells and showers. It comes in stark contrast to last year, when Britain endured the coldest December in a century. A record low Christmas Day temperature for England of -15.9c (3f) was recorded last year in Shawbury, Shropshire, while Altnaharra in the Scottish Highlands set the UK record at -18.2c (-1f). Making the most of it: Jacob Sargent and his grandmother Denise Sargent enjoyed the snow at Storey Arms in south Wales this week. Forecaster Michael Lawrence said: . ‘This week will be much milder. By Wednesday, temperatures will be mild . for the time of year and in low double figures generally – even minimum . night-time temperatures will be higher than current daytime maximums. ‘Christmas Day’s weather pattern looks completely different to the set-up last year. ‘This Christmas, milder Atlantic air will bring brief settled and sunny interludes, with bands of rain in between.’ Although the next week will certainly . be mild for the time of year, temperatures are not expected to top the . record for the warmest Christmas Day of 15.6c (60f) set in Leith, near . Edinburgh, in 1896 and matched in Killerton, Devon, in 1920. Last week, bookmakers slashed this . year’s white Christmas odds as short as 5/2 in Newcastle and 9/2 in . London after snow coated the ground as far south as Exmoor in Devon and . continued to sweep across parts of the north. Deep freeze: Canal boats in the frozen Leeds and Liverpool Canal, central Lancashire, yesterday after the water froze over . Winter chill: The water froze over as temperatures plummeted yesterday on the Leeds and Liverpool canal, Central Lancashire . Before the warmer winds blow in tomorrow, the Met Office has issued an amber ‘be prepared’ weather warning for snow and ice over Tayside and the border region this morning. During the weekend's big freeze, a . mountain walker plunged 500ft to his death after a snow cornice he was . walking along collapsed. A woman who was with him on Y Garn, a 3,000ft peak in Snowdonia, fell 100ft but was rescued uninjured by a brave abseiler. The tragedy happened after the walkers decided to cross a large cornice of overhanging snow which they thought was solid ground. The snow gave way and caused an avalanche which killed the man. A third walker with them did not fall. On Sunday in North Yorkshire, . a group of walkers who became stranded in freezing conditions had to be . saved by an RAF helicopter. The six hikers were attempting to walk . between Fylingdales and Ravenscar when they fell into . difficulties at Juggers Ravine. A family . member alerted police at 6.50pm after receiving a phone call for help from one of the . walking party, who were all aged between 19 and 45. The group was stranded in the ravine and two of their party, two women in their 40s, had . become unwell. Due to the freezing temperatures, the walkers found themselves unable to . move and needed help. A joint search and rescue operation was put into . action, including North Yorkshire Police, Scarborough and Ryedale Mountain . Rescue service and an RAF search and rescue helicopter. The walkers were . located and rescued by the helicopter team at 8.30pm. The two women were . taken to Scarborough General Hospital to be checked over but were found to be . uninjured. The remaining walkers were transferred separately to join them. All six hikers were returned home safe and well.","Britain could 'bask' in 14c temperatures in the run-up to Christmas .

The London Mayor said plans to allow doctors to prescribe a lethal dose to anyone who could 'reasonably be expected to die within six months' could mean some people come under pressure to end their lives too soon. Mr Johnson warned ‘life is precious and our psychology fragile’ and any change to the law must be made with caution. On Friday peers will debate a law allowing doctors to prescribe a lethal dose to terminally ill patients judged to have less than six months to live. The legislation has been drawn up by Lord Falconer, a former Labour Lord Chancellor who served in Tony Blair’s Cabinet. The Church of England has urged Lord Falconer to drop his Bill in favour of a Royal Commission into the issue. Mr Johnson revealed he has met the campaign Dignity in Dying to discuss the issue ahead of this week’s debate. He said he found the young woman he met ‘charming and persuasive’, he became concerned about the wording of the Bill. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Johnson said: ‘I started to worry that it might indeed pave the way for something unintended – something ugly and distressing: not exactly a culture of death, but a world in which it was simply too easy to opt for this state-approved self-extinction.’ The Bill, to be debated on Friday states that doctors would be able to prescribe a lethal dose of medicine to people who could ‘reasonably be expected to die within six months’. Mr Johnson suggested that the wording be ‘tighetned up’ to cover only those people who ‘could not reasonably be expected to survive more than six months’. He added: I think it right to be cautious, because we are proposing to make a very big change in our approach to death and dying: giving people much more of a right to choose when to die, and above all giving the state an obligation to help us consciously to do away with ourselves, if certain conditions are satisfied. ‘I am sure it is a change the public broadly supports, and one whose time has come. But life is precious and our psychology fragile. ‘Those suffering terminal illnesses can easily find themselves under pressure – external or internal – to make decisions from which, obviously, there is no going back.’ Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby warned a proposed new law on assisted dying is ‘mistaken and dangerous’, but his predecessor Lord Carey insists it would not be ‘anti-Christian’ to change the law . Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu says he would not like his life to be 'prolonged artificially' Lord . Falconer’s Assisted Dying Bill would require patients to administer the . poison themselves. It  would not help those who are paralysed or lack . the capacity to operate a mechanism to inject the drugs. Existing . rules effectively mean no relative or friend will be prosecuted for . aiding a suicide if it is done out of compassion and not for gain. But . they ban British doctors taking any role in a death. Falconer’s . Bill would enable doctors to help a patient die by prescribing deadly . drugs if they are  terminally ill and expected to die within six months. The patient would have to be over 18 and to have lived in England or Wales for at least a year. Two . doctors would have to certify the patient was terminally ill and it was . their informed wish to die. The patient would also have to signify . their consent. There would be 14 days before drugs were provided, or six . days if death was expected within a month. Last week former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey revealed that he had dropped his long-standing opposition to the legalisation of assisted dying – and declared that it would not be ‘anti-Christian’ to change the law. He warned that by opposing reform, the Church he led risks 'promoting anguish and pain, the very opposite of a Christian message of hope.’ However, current Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said warned the Bill would leave a ‘sword of Damocles’ hanging over the elderly, putting them under pressure to end their lives. Yesterday former Archbishop Desmond Tutu came out in favour of a change in the law on the right to die. Writing in The Observer, he said: ‘Yes, I think a lot of people would be upset if I said I wanted assisted dying. I would say I wouldn't mind actually. ‘I have come to realise that I do not want my life to be prolonged artificially. ‘I think when you need machines to help you breathe then you have to ask questions about the quality of life being experienced and about the way money is being spent. This may be hard for some people to consider.’ He argued that money should be focussed ‘a mother giving birth to a baby, or an organ transplant needed by a young person’. The Bishop of Buckingham, the Right Reverend Alan Wilson, yesterday became the first serving bishop to back the right to die. He said: ‘I have come to support assisted dying precisely because I do believe strongly in the sanctity of life. 'Part of honouring this is respecting people’s integrity to make decisions about themselves.’ About right: Sir Chris Woodhead is backing the bill . Sir Chris Woodhead, the former chief inspector of schools who is now a quadriplegic, yesterday gave his backing to Lord Falconer’s Assisted Dying Bill. He believes the proposals are ‘about right’ and in tune with public opinion. And he said the Falconer law would allow doctors who help suffering patients to die to be free from the threat of prosecution and career disaster. ‘They would have the option and they would know that they were not going to be prosecuted under any circumstance.’ Sir Chris made his reputation challenging the educational establishment over school standards in the 1990s. He was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2006 and subsequently told he has cancer and other complications. He told the Murnaghan programme on Sky News that the decision to end one’s life ‘must be a matter for consideration within the family and arguably with close friends as well’. ‘I wouldn’t dream of proceeding with the decision to kill myself or to have my death assisted without the acceptance of those who are nearest and dearest to me,’ he said. The Falconer proposals were ‘about right, given the range of public opinion on this issue’. Alternatives were ‘bleak’. ‘I would be far better if I could have my death assisted in a peaceful, dignified way so that my suffering wasn’t prolonged.’","Lords to debate law allowing doctors to prescribe lethal does to terminally ill .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The NHS has written a song to teach children not to go to A&E unless it is a real emergency. Schools are being urged to teach the lyrics as part of a campaign fronted by a knitted monkey to ease the pressure on casualty departments. One million more people visited A&E last year compared to 3 years ago, and officials claim that if one child from every school wen to their GP instead they it would save £1.4million. The toy Monkey is being used by the NHS to educated children about what it is like to go to hospital, and the alternatives when it is not a real emergency . A kit has been sent to every primary school in England to help teach children about the structure of the health service. The NHS hopes youngsters will succeed where politicians and doctors have failed, and persuade their parents to consider alternatives to rushing to A&E. It follows successful campaigns on recycling and road safety, where adults came under pressure to change their behaviour after being nagged by their children. The ‘Monkey Wellbeing’ has been produced for the NHS by primary school teacher Helen Sadler. It includes puppets, DVDs, posters, stories, stickers and a song to educate children about different NHS services. Children who remember the difference between a walk-in centre and a pharmacy are given an NHS Explorer badge. A series of slides presents different health scenarios and asks children to consider whether they would need to go to A&E . It is claimed that if one child from every primary school does not go to A&E as a result of the packs, it would save the NHS £1.4million . An evaluation of the packs produced earlier this year shows that the song in particular has proved a hit with pupils. The lyrics include: ‘When Monkey’s feeling poorly or gets an injury / He doesn’t have to swing straight to A and E / There are lots of friendly people in the NHS / So here’s a Monkey song to help you choose what’s best.’ There are also slides which show the Monkey with different ailments, and the children have to decide where best to seek treatment. It includes having a headache, being bullied, feeling sick and having a crayon stuck up his nose. Organisers of the scheme claim : ‘If the pack can prevent one child from each of the 19,088 Primary Schools in England from visiting an Emergency Department unnecessarily then the NHS could save £1.4 million.’ Reducing the number of people who turn up at A&E with non-emergencies has become a major political issue. David Cameron and Ed Miliband have repeatedly clashed in the Commons on waiting times to be seen. The Prime Minister said last week: ‘Of course more people are going to A and E departments in our country—over a million more people—but we are meeting our targets,and waiting times are down by a half.’ However, patient groups are unimpressed by the attempt to use children to cojole their parents into using different NHS services. Joyce Robins, co-director of Patient Concern, told The Times: 'Don’t try to put children in charge of when it is necessary to use public services like A&E.' When Monkey’s feeling poorly or gets an injury, He doesn’t have to swing straight to A and E . There are lots of friendly people in the NHS, So here’s a Monkey song to help you choose what’s best . CHORUS . Try a.... Grown up, pharmacist, helpline, GP, School Nurse, ChildLine, out of hours surgery . On-line, walk in, 999, A&E, Monkey, here to help you through . Monkey, knows just what to do, Monkey, always there for you Monkey . If you’ve got the sniffles or a little scrape, Don’t go bananas and don’t go ape . Talk to a grown-up or your school nurse, They’ll help you out so it doesn’t get worse . If you’re monkey puzzled and still feel unwell, You can give the helpline a little bell . They’ll listen hard to what you have to say, Or look online at NHS.uk . CHORUS . Monkey sometimes goes to see the jungle GP, He knows little Monkey and his family . But out of office hours, if Monkey’s sick up in his tree, Go to the walk in centre or out of hours GP . If someone has an accident or is really really sick, Don’t monkey around - you need to act quick . If you need an ambulance, move quick call 999, Or go to A&E and you’ll be seen on time! CHORUS . Monkey tries to stay healthy, he eats his 5 a day, . His paws are clean, he’s really keen to keep the germs away . He like swinging in the trees, oh it’s great to run and play, . An apple - or banana – help to keep the Doc away . So be happy and be active and you’ll stay very well, . But sometimes we’re all poorly and we feel unwell . There are lots of friendly people in the NHS, . But staying fit and healthy is what everyone likes best!","A song is being used to persuade schoolchildren not to rush to hospital .
