"The head of the BBC has admitted he thinks the television ‘watershed’ is doomed. Director General Tony Hall openly declared what many viewers have long feared – that the days of the 9pm cut-off are numbered. The watershed - designed to prevent children being exposed to violence, sex and swearing – has been appreciated by families for decades. BBC Director General Tony Hall has openly declared that that the days of the 9pm cut-off are numbered . But now Lord Hall has confessed: ‘The watershed is still a useful way of judging the content and sensitivities, and taste and decency issues. But has the watershed got a future in 20 or 30 years’ time? I suspect not.’ There has been mounting concern that the 9pm cut-off is being abolished by stealth, with explicit content increasingly aired earlier in the evening. In particular, series such as The X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent have been criticised for screening raunchy early-evening performances by singers such as Jennifer Lopez and Rihanna. There are also worries about music videos that are available online and can be viewed by children of any age. In a wide-ranging interview in this week’s Radio Times, Lord Hall was asked about violence towards women in drama The Fall and a recent rape storyline in EastEnders, which is broadcast earlier than the watershed. He said: ‘EastEnders has been rejuvenated over the past year, and if that was all we did, I can understand the point, but at the same time we’re doing dramas like Esio Trot, Wolf Hall. 'There’s a range of drama and it’s right that our dramas look at very tough issues in a way that is sensitive. If [violence against women] was the entirety of what we did, I would be concerned, but it’s not.’ There has been mounting concern that the 9pm cut-off is being abolished by stealth, with explicit content increasingly aired earlier in the evening. Families have long-appreciated the watershed (file picture, posed) In recent months, media campaign groups have warned of a ‘slippery slope’, with increasingly adult themes featuring in pre-watershed programmes. The BBC featured a nude dominatrix in its hit detective drama Sherlock 25 minutes before the watershed. The watershed was introduced in 1964 and broadcasters came under increasing pressure to abide by it by campaigners such as Mary Whitehouse, who was ridiculed by some as being out of touch after she railed against broadcasters and artists whose work she felt was obscene. In 1965 she founded the National Viewers’ and Listeners’ Association, using it as a platform to criticise the BBC for its perceived lack of accountability and excessive portrayals of sex, violence and bad language. At the time, she was loathed by liberals such as then BBC Director General Sir Hugh Carleton Greene, whom she once called the ‘devil incarnate’. Lord Hall confessed this week: ‘The watershed is still a useful way of judging the content and sensitivities, and taste and decency issues. But has the watershed got a future in 20 or 30 years’ time? I suspect not’ But since her death aged 91 in 2001, a growing number of commentators have said her views on the dangers of broadcasting gratuitous sex and violence had been ahead of their time. In 2010 veteran broadcaster Dame Joan Bakewell, who fought for a new liberal age of freedom, admitted that she had come to agree with her one-time bête noire. And last month actress Julie Walters agreed too – saying she had been wrong to dismiss Mrs Whitehouse’s ideas in the 1970s. Last year, broadcasting watchdog Ofcom, in charge of monitoring the watershed, said a survey showed a record 78 per cent support for the 9pm cut-off.","BBC Director General Tony Hall said days of the watershed are numbered .

"Shocking CCTV images capture the moment a masked gang smashed their way into a jewellery store before making off with thousands of pounds worth of goods. Raiders carried out the robbery on Naz Jewellers in Rochdale, Greater Manchester in broad daylight last Thursday lunchtime. Images from the store's CCTV cameras show four men running towards the shop before one of them uses a battering ram to get through two doors. CCTV from Naz Jewellers in Rochdale, Greater Manchester shows the gang using sledgehammers during a raid at around 12.30pm last Thursday (January 22) The robbers broke through a security door before filling six bags with expensive jewellery and making off . Staff fled into the back of the store fearing they would be attacked by the men - who they said spoke with Asian accents. A £60,000 BMW X5 waited in the busy Milkstone Road outside, while the men used a sledgehammer to smash through display cabinets and steal jewellery. The gang then ran back to the car and made off before police could arrive. The car was abandoned nearby. The value of the six bags of jewellery taken has not been revealed and police are appealing for information. Detective Sergeant Laura Sutcliffe said: 'This is a very serious incident in which weapons have been used in order to intimidate staff and then steal items. 'Detectives are investigating several lines of inquiry but I would like to reassure the public that this is an isolated incident.' A silver BMW X5 waited outside while the raid took place - it was later found abandoned nearby . The CCTV footage released by the police shows how the gang used a battering ram to get through two doors . The masked raiders quickly targeted expensive jewellery as staff retreated into the back of the shop . Detective Sergeant Sutcliffe added: 'Thankfully no-one was physically injured but clearly everyone inside the store is suffering from severe shock as it has had a significant impact on them. 'This violent robbery happened on a busy street in broad daylight in the middle of the day, so we believe there may be a significant number of witnesses who could have vital information for us. 'There may have been a number of people who filmed what was happening on their smartphones so if you did see what happened, or you did take some footage, then please contact us. 'We are working with the store to establish exactly what was stolen but in the meantime, if you are offered pieces of jewellery which you suspect may be stolen then please call us immediately.'","Four robbers raided town centre shop while getaway car waited outside .

"Subway trains still ran under New York City overnight despite being closed off to commuters. Trains were heard going through a number of stations after services were suspended at 11pm on Monday, surprising travellers as they could not board them. The preemptive decision by Governor Andrew Cuomo and the MTA allegedly shocked transit workers because the trains need to run overnight so they can clear the tracks. Still running: Subway trains were running through the night, even after services were suspended at 11pm on Monday, baffling commuters . It was the first time the entire system has been shutdown purely because of the snow in its 111-year history. The action was taken before the brunt of the snowstorm hit the city. As a result of the state-wide road ban and the early cancellation of public transport, the Subway seemed the only viable way to get around the city through the night. A source told The Brooklyn Paper: 'I think it’s horrible, purely political decision, not based on anything that’s needed. It seemed like cutting out a necessary lifeline unnecessarily. 'The underground lifeline should be open.' Deserted stations: Trains were captured going through Astor Place after the closure. A transit worker branded the decision as 'political' and 'unnecessary' During a press conference on Monday, Governor Cuomo said: 'This blizzard is forecasted to be one of the worst this region has seen, and we must put safety first and take all the necessary precautions. Commuters and drivers need to get home before the storm completely cripples our transit networks and roads.' Some of the lines on the system - including sections of the B and Q - are low-lying and outdoors, meaning a closure would be necessary. However the remainder is underground or elevated, meaning snow may not have been an issue.","Trains were heard in stations even though travellers couldn't board .

"Two men are locked in a legal battle over a 65ft hedge which it's claimed ruined the view of their picturesque Scottish valley. The neighbours in Elgin, Moray, have enlisted lawyers in the dispute after the hedge's owner refused to cut a row of trees to half their height - a job which it is claimed would cost £10,000. It is the first 'hedge rage' case of its kind in the rural region, thanks to new powers which were originally brought in under England's Anti-Social Behaviour Act in 2010. Hedge rage: Two men are locked in a legal battle over a 65ft-tall row of trees (pictured centre) which it's claimed ruined the view of a picturesque Scottish valley from a bungalow. 'All we see is the hedge', he said . Landowner Donald Farquhar Brown, 58, complained the spruce, larch, silver birch and beech trees on a private track had steadily blocked out the light from his bungalow. 'When we bought the property 20 years ago we had uninterrupted views down the valley - now all we see is the hedge,' he fumed to council officers. He asked 53-year-old neighbour John Albiston to cut down the trees to just over 30ft tall, around half their current height. But Mr Brown's neighbour refused, and the two men then became embroiled in a dispute about whether the row of trees legally counted as a hedge or not. The row has ended up in the hands of Moray Council, whose officers were forced to look up the Oxford English Dictionary definition of a hedge. Mr Brown said the trees did count as a hedge because there were hardly any gaps between them. But the hedge's owner disagreed - with his solicitors writing: 'Our client’s position is that the trees do not in fact comprise a “hedge” because they were never intended to be a maintained garden boundary. Dispute: Council officers said the hedge should be cut every year to stop it growing above 33ft (file photo) 'They simply form part of a plantation of trees in a generally wooded rural location. 'In our client’s opinion the trees complained of do not cause any significant loss of light in the applicant’s garden, and do not materially contribute to any effect on the growth of plants.' Mr Brown told The Scotsman he had already spent more than £1,000 on lawyers. 'They grow by about a foot and a half a year,' he said. 'Nothing has been done with them over the years and we have lost our view and light coming into the house. 'Not only that, we have concerns that they are a danger in high winds. The trees are very thin and during gales they get blown down.' Council officers have now decided the trees are a hedge after all - and have recommended they are reduced in height to 33ft before birds have a chance to nest in them. If councillors rubber-stamp the plans today, the hedge's owner could be legally bound to prune the trees every year so they never grow beyond 33ft again.","Unusual row between two rural landowners near Elgin, northern Scotland .

"Blanket driving bans were lifted and New York public transport was to reopen on Tuesday after the several feet of snow promised for the city failed to materialize. The 'historic storm' which Mayor Bill de Blasio had threatened fortunately skipped over most of New York and by 7am there was, at most, about 10 inches of snow in the city. Mayor de Blasio was defiant and unapologetic this morning, saying that forecasts across the board has predicted 2 feet of snow, adding: 'We did what was necessary to keep everyone safe...This is a better safe than sorry scenario.' A blizzard warning was lifted on Tuesday morning but a winter storm warning remained in place. The National Weather Service said the city could see another 1 to 3 inches on Tuesday with winds up to 40 mph.  Snowfall was expected to slow in the city by midday. Schools, public offices and many businesses were closed on Tuesday after the Metropolitan Transport Agency (MTA) made the historic decision to shut down the transport network at 11pm on Monday night. Subway trains and buses were beginning service from 9am on Tuesday - by midday it would be operating a Sunday service (about 60 per cent of the full service). The Staten Island Ferry service had also resumed. New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo said a travel ban imposed in 13 counties at 11pm on Monday would be lifted at 8am.

All nine MTA Bridge & Tunnel facilities were now open to vehicles in New York City. The Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Railroad, and city buses and subways  - including the Staten Island Railway were slowly resuming service. All service will operate on a Sunday schedule on Tuesday which is about 40 per cent less than usual. Full service will be resumed on Wednesday. Staten Island Ferry service has also resumed. The travel ban for Suffolk County in eastern Long Island remained in effect, because it had been much harder hit with up to 16 inches of snow. The blizzard warning remains in effect for eastern Long Island along with much of Connecticut. Governor Cuomo told CNN: 'The plows have been working, salt trucks have been working, but it is not to be taken lightly. We're not saying that you should go out unless you really need to go out. 'And there will be delays on the roads. But we think we can lift the travel ban in coordination with our neighboring states. And we'll start to bring the public transportation system back online.' Cuomo said many areas had received two feet of snow and that Long Island had been particularly affected, but added that New York city had experienced less damage. Measures were put in place in preparation for what Mayor de Blasio had described as 'a storm like we have never seen before' - but as the night passed, the huge blizzard did not materialize.

"Sea captains have reported ‘funeral processions’ and grieving behaviour in bottlenosed dolphins . And now a new study suggests that Atlantic spotted dolphins also mourn the death of their offspring. Scientists reported four adult dolphins ‘displaying nurturant behaviour’ by supporting a dead calf in the waters off Madeira. A new study suggests that Atlantic spotted dolphins (stock image) mourn the death of offspring. Scientists reported four adult dolphins ‘displaying nurturant behaviour’ by supporting a dead calf in the waters off Madeira, as well as another instance of the behaviour . A group of researchers from the University of Porto, Portugal, studied two instances of nurturing and seemingly sympathetic behaviour. The first was noted by the operator of a tourist boat and recorded four adult dolphins supporting the body of a dead calf using their backs and heads, which continued for half an hour before the group moved on, Wired reported. The second was seen by staff on a research vessel. They said that one dolphin, thought to be a mother, was supporting a dead calf on the water’s surface. ‘The in situ observations show that adult Atlantic spotted dolphins try to support their dead calves at surface, either involving a single individual (presumably the mother) or several individuals,’ the researchers wrote in the study, published in Acta Ethologica. ‘The in situ observations show that adult Atlantic spotted dolphins try to support their dead calves at surface, either involving a single individual (presumably the mother) or several individuals,’ the researchers wrote in the study. A stock image of an Atlantic spotted dolphin is shown . The first instance of nurturing behaviour was noted by the operator of a tourist boat and recorded adult dolphins supporting the body of a dead calf using their backs and heads, which continued for half an hour before the group moved on. The second, was seen by staff on a research vessel. They said that one dolphin, thought to be a mother, was supporting a dead calf on the water’s surface. Post mortem examinations were carried out on the dolphin carcasses described in the study, as well as two other dead calves, which were found floating alone nearby. They revealed that the four calves died from natural causes and not from predation or violent pod behaviour. ‘The highly fresh condition of the carcasses suggests that the adults abandon them after a short period of time (hours),’ according to the study. Filipe Alves, who led the study, said there are records of other dolphin species carrying the carcasses of their young for days, but Atlantic spotted dolphins seem to mourn their young quickly, long before they start to decompose. Bottlenosed dolphins, sea otters, harbour seals, apes and elephants are among the animals believed to grieve for dead family members. Although this is difficult to prove, Dr Alves thinks that Atlantic spotted dolphins join the emotionally intelligent group. He said he believes that animals such as elephants and pilot wales that spend a lifetime together – sometimes over 60 years – ‘can grieve’. Bottlenosed dolphins, sea otters, harbour seals, apes and elephants are among the animals believed to grieve for dead family members. Here, a two-year-old calf called Jumaane grieves his dead mother . In spring 2013, the captain of a tourist boat encountered a dolphin carrying her dead calf using her dorsal fin, through the water. Dave Anderson, who saw the sad event off the coast of Dana Point, California, said he had never seen anything like it in his 20 years at sea. In spring 2013, the captain of tourist boat encountered a dolphin carrying her dead calf using her dorsal fin (pictured), through water off the coast of Dana Point, California . 'Nor have I ever seen anything quite as moving as this mother who refuses to let go of her poor calf,' he wrote on his YouTube channel. 'Did mom start off helping her weak, sick offspring swim to the surface to breathe for days till the tiny dolphin died? 'When will she give up on her calf? Will she continue carrying her deceased on her back until the carcass begins to disintegrate?' The sad behaviour has been seen before in bottlenosed dolphins, a few of which have been recorded carrying dead calves even after they started to decompose.","Scientists from the University of Porto, Portugal, reported adult Atlantic spotted dolphins off the coast of Madeira displaying nurturing behaviour .

"The heiress to the Walmart fortune is demanding $90,000 from a multi-millionaire property developer because she claims construction work on a Bel Air mega-mansion destroyed a beloved eucalyptus tree. Nancy Walton Laurie claims a wall at the sprawling Los Angeles property being developed by multi-millionaire Mohamed Hadid has 'cut the roots to the family's cherished eucalyptus tree, causing it severe damage and putting it at risk of falling over.' The house called 901 Strada Vecchia has caused outrage among neighbors, with many contesting that it has violated building permits and size restrictions. Hadid is the former husband of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Yolanda Foster and father of supermodel Gigi Hadid, 19. He is renowned for building enormous properties in LA including the $195million 'Palazzo di Amore' - said to be the most expensive home on the US market. Angry: Nancy Walton Laurie claims a Bel Air mansion property being developed has 'cut the roots to her family's 'cherished' eucalyptus tree, causing it severe damage and putting it at risk of falling over.' Developer: Mohamed Hadid (pictured with his model daughter Gigi, 19) is renowned for building enormous properties in LA including the $195million 'Palazzo di Amore' - said to be the most expensive home publically available on the US market . According to a summary judgement filed to the company, obtained by the Beverly Hills Courier, LW Partnership contends the home's designer Mohamed Hadid's company 'with full knowledge of the boundry line between the parties' properties, nevertheless constructed a wall that stands at least 100 feet on the neighboring family's property without the family's consent. 'In the process, his company cut the roots to the family's cherished eucalyptus tree, causing it severe damage and putting it at risk of falling over.' Hadid's attorney, Bruce Rudman, insists the new wall has been built in exactly the same place as the old one. He said: 'We have an arborist who says the tree is thriving, and at one point in time was suffering from the drought. 'This isn't about money. This is about principle. The wall serves the land much better than little piece of land they are complaining about.' In September construction was halted at the home after neighbor and entertainment lawyer Joseph Horacek III waged war at Hadid and the project. He claimed Hadid illegally demolished the original house located there and stipulated the construction had exceeded height limits. While 'bombarding' city officials with complaints about the project, he nicknamed it the 'Starship Enterprise'.

"The State of Georgia executed an 'intellectually disabled' man for murdering a fellow inmate while in prison. Warren Lee Hill was killed by lethal injection, despite please from his attorneys who said he has the cognitive capacity of a child. Officials confirmed that he died at 7:55pm Tuesday at the state prison in Jackson, Georgia . Executed: Warren Lee Hill was confirmed dead at 7:55pm by officials in Jackson, Georgia's state prison . Earlier his attorneys asked the Supreme Court to stay his execution on the grounds that his mental impairment made him ineligible for the death penalty. The court refused. His lawyers have claimed Hill had an IQ or just 70, though state lawyers said other tests had given results of 90. Hill was sentenced to death for the 1991 murder of Joseph Handspike, a fellow inmate at the prison where he was being held for killing his girlfriend in 1986. According to local news station WBSTV, he attacked Joseph Handspike with a nail-studded board and beat him to death. Protest: Many had gathered in the hope that Warren's execution would be stayed because of his mental condition . Argument: Lawyers for Hill tried to get the Supreme Court to intervene - but they did not stay the execution . Georgia corrections officials said that Hill declined to request a last meal. As such he was given Shepherd pie with mashed potatoes, and fruit punch to drink. He made no final statement. A statement from his lawyers, issued after the Supreme Court decision but before Hill was killed, said: 'Tonight, Georgia will unconstitutionally execute Mr. Hill, a man with the emotional and cognitive ability of a young boy. This execution is an abomination.' They had brought dozens of witnesses and experts who said Warren was not of sound mind, but say that Georgia's standard of proof for mental capacity are so high that they are impossible to meet in practice. His execution date had been set three times before, but each time the courts issued temporary stays in response to new legal challenges.","Warren Lee Hill was given lethal injection at facility in Jackson, Georgia .

"Media mogul Rupert Murdoch has fired his second broadside at Prime Minister Tony Abbott in just two days, urging him to sack his chief of staff Peta Credlin. In a series of social media posts, Murdoch wrote that Mr Abbott's controversial top adviser 'must do her patriotic duty and resign' if he doesn't sack her. The demand came after the billionaire branded Mr Abbott's decision to knight Prince Philip a 'joke and embarrassment' and a News Corp columnist said Credlin should be sacrificed. Murdoch tweeted: 'Forget fairness. This change only way to recover team work and achieve so much possible for Australia. Leading involves cruel choices'. He later justified his message by praising Credlin's character. '(She's) a good person. Just appealing to her proven patriotism.' Following public ridicule and dissension in his own ranks, the prime minister today said he stood by his decision to knight the Duke of Edinburgh. But he told reporters in Melbourne he accepted people were upset by it. 'I respect their right to be critical... and I take it on the chin, I take it on the chin.' Scroll down for video .

Several unnamed MPs have told the press they are chafing under her tight direction of the Prime Minister's Office, or PMO. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has stridently defended his top political operator, telling the ABC in December: 'Do you really think my chief of staff would be under this kind of criticism if her name was Peter as opposed to Peta?' The remarks came after a frontbencher reportedly told The Australian that Ms Credlin and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop 'were like two Siamese fighting fish in the same tank' and that their relationship had broken down. Murdoch met with Ms Bishop in New York at the weekend, according to the Australian Financial Review. Power player: Prime Minister Tony Abbott's chief adviser has been singled out by Rupert Murdoch .

Power figure: A Prime Minister's chief of staff is typically one of the most powerful figures in the government . Education Minister Christopher Pyne today hailed Rupert Murdoch as one of the greatest Australians . Prince Philip, pictured right, has not issued a statement about his award . A column by opinion writer Miranda Devine in the Daily Telegraph today said Ms Credlin was being blamed for Mr Abbott's gaffe and she should be sacrificed. She suggested Mr Abbott replace her with News Corp columnist Chris Kenny, a former adviser to one-time Foreign Minister Alexander Downer. 'The Prime Minister has to make a sacrificial offering to convince his colleagues that he has learned a lesson,' Devine wrote. 'Something that causes him pain, like chopping off his right arm. In other words, moving on chief of staff Peta Credlin. 'Justly or not, she is being blamed for the Prince Philip gaffe. 'It was Abbott’s decision but it’s the job of the chief of staff, who he has been known to call the Boss, to stop him from making such a blunder.' Education Minister Christopher Pyne has already jumped to Ms Credlin's defence, saying she was 'absolutely intrinsic to our success'. 'I support the chief of staff, Peta Credlin,' he said. 'I don’t think there is any prospect of his suggestion being pursued by the government.' The PM today told reporters he stood be his decision to bestow a knigthood on Prince Philip, saying he had made a 'great contribution' to Australian public life. 'I accept that it's been a contentious decision – I absolutely accept that – and I absolutely respect people's rights to disagree with my call on this,' he said. 'But Prince Philip has been a distinguished servant of this country throughout a long and active public life. 'He’s been part of some of the big events in our national life going back to the 1956 Olympics here in this city (Melbourne). Mr Abbott pointed to the popularity of the Duke of Edinburgh Leadership Awards as one of his major contributions. Rupert Murdoch was far from the only figure to criticise Mr Abbott's 'captain's call'. Queensland premier Campbell Newman, who is in the fight of his political life on the campaign trail, told reporters he disagreed with the decision and described it as a 'bolt from the blue'. Nationals deputy leader Barnaby Joyce told ABC Radio: 'I'm always of the strong belief that all awards should be for Australians'. Backbencher Ewen Jones told the ABC he was fine for previous governors-general to be made knights and dames knighthoods and d . Prime Minister Tony Abbott has hailed Peta Credlin on the role she played in bringing him to the nation's top office . Ms Credlin has worked for Liberal leaders Malcolm Turnbull (pictured), Brendan Nelson and now Prime Minister Tony Abbott . Murdoch was far from alone in criticising the knighthood, with Queensland Liberal National Party MPs Warren Entsch and Ewen Jones criticising the decision in various media interviews. They were joined by Northern Territory Chief Minister Adam Giles - a Country Liberal - who told reporters on Monday: 'It's Australia Day. We're not a bunch of tossers, let's get it right.' Even former prime minister John Howard, an Abbott mentor, declined to comment on the decision when approached by Ten Eyewitness News this week. In an Australia Day press conference, Mr Abbott wrote off widespread derision on social media by describing it as 'electronic graffiti' - a far cry from his remarks today. 'Social media is kind of like electronic graffiti and I think that in the media, you make a big mistake to pay too much attention to social media,' he told reporters. The prime minister's standing has flagged with colleagues after a series of bungled policy decisions, including an attempt to ram through an unpopular cut to the Medicare rebate.","Rupert Murdoch says Peta Credlin 'must do her patriotic duty and resign'

"Don Lemon has had the last laugh despite his widely ridiculed coverage of the Blizzard of 2015 in which he tooled around a desolate Manhattan while reporting from a car he dubbed the 'Blizzardmobile.' While Lemon trended on Twitter for hours, it was mostly thanks to viewers poking fun at such bizarre segments as his 4-way panel on Deflate-gate, report on Aaron Hernandez and repeated use of the word Blizzardmobile - which was in fact just a SUV. However, CNN's Brian Stelter says it was a big hit. It was just a car: CNN's 'Blizzardmobile' coverage with Don Lemon on the streets of a deserted Manhattan won ridicule Monday night but also big ratings . 'About last night,' Stelter tweeted Tuesday. 'CNN's 10pm hour, w/ @DonLemon in the #blizzardmobile, was its highest-rated hour of the day in 25-54 demo. Topped Fox.' The Twitter critics had no way to know this, of course, and even after Stelter's boast, jokes about Blizzardgate continued popping up across social media. Among those making fun of Lemon and his glorified SUV was comedian Mike Birbiglia, who tweeted: . Last laugh? Despite all the ridicule it received, the Blizzardmobile was a hit, according to CNN's Brian Stelter . Who's to blame? Viewers took to Twitter to express their confusion over Don Lemon's antics in the Blizzardmobile, which included a 4-way discussion of Deflate-gate with the chyron 'Who's to blame for deflated balls' all while Lemon sat inside the oddly-lit SUV . 'Gotta be a strange feeling when you're driving in your weird, dimly lit ""Blizzard Mobile"" and realize it's only gonna be a foot of snow.' Jezebel managing editor Erin Gloria Ryan joked, 'Twist: Don Lemon's Blizzardmobile rounds a corner and discovers, on an empty Manhattan street, the missing plane.' And in response to one of Blizzardmobile's oddest moments, Mark Joyella tweeted: .

"A moving new campaign has been launched to help ex-cons adjust to society by transforming their prison tattoos into colorful works of art. The Freedom Tattoos project, a collaboration between the Pedagogium College of Social Sciences in Warsaw, Poland, and ad agency Isobar Poland, was created to 'transform crude, hideous amateur tattoos made in prisons and juvenile detention centers into professional, socially well-perceived artistic tattoos, that will help them find a job', according to its website. In a YouTube video describing the project, Pedagogium Professor Konopczynski explains why prison tattoos are harder to remove than ink designs done in regular parlors. Scroll down for video . Bad ink: The Freedom Tattoos project aims to help ex-cons adjust to society by transforming their prison tattoos into colorful works of art; one woman had the word 'vendetta' (left) turned into an artful design (right) Mirror, mirror: The woman is seen happily checking out the results of her transformation . 'Prison tattoos are made with improvised equipment assembled at the facility,' he said. 'Removing them is hard and leaves visible scars. They stigmatize and discourage potential employers.' The video shows two formerly incarcerated women having their tattoos camouflaged by new designs. One explains that she had the word 'vendetta' inked on the back of her neck at a juvenile detention center eight years ago, and was eager to have it covered for the sake of her children. After meeting with a Freedom Tattoos artist, she is told that her prison ink can be camouflaged and transformed into a piece of art that she will be proud to show her children. Before: 'For twelve years, I haven't looked at my arms,' another woman says, revealing a crudely-drawn shark tattoo (pictured) she received in prison . After: She has the shark tattoo transformed into a pretty red floral pattern (pictured) Emotional: 'Now I can discover a part of myself again. Now, I can take another step,' she says after seeing the new design . And when she sees the beautiful floral artwork that has replaced the basic wording, she exclaims: 'Oh my God...the ""vendetta"" is gone!' A few weeks after her tattoo transformation, she adds: 'Now everything is different. And when my tattoo was healing, my son would come to me with an ointment to put on my wounds. This program gave me a great chance. A chance to start a new life.' The other woman, who has lived with a crudely-drawn shark tattoo for more than a decade, reveals: 'For twelve years, I haven't looked at my arms. I just don't look at myself in the mirror. It's like I don't have a part of myself.' After her tattoo is transformed into an elaborate floral design, she is overcome with emotion. Fresh start: The women work with the Freedom Tattoos artists to create a meaningful design that will camouflage their prison ink . Mission statement: The project was launched to show that 'social rehabilitation is not about erasing the past, but rather building on it based on one's talents and passions' Happy ending: 'Oh my God...the ""vendetta"" is gone!' the first woman exclaims when she sees her new tattoo . 'Now I can discover a part of myself again,' she says. 'Now, I can take another step. And this is fantastic because I don't have to be locked up anymore in that gray world that held me back.' Professor Konopczynski further explains the significance of adding to the tattoos rather than eliminating them altogether. 'At Pedagogium, we teach that social rehabilitation is not about erasing the past, but rather building on it based on one's talents and passions. Sometimes the slightest change in one's life can bring the best results,' he says. 'If they decided to get tattoos, then it means that they wanted to express something. We help them express themselves better.'","The Freedom Tattoos project is a joint effort from the Pedagogium College of Social Sciences in Warsaw, Poland, and ad agency Isobar Poland .

"The UK’s biggest banks were last night accused of being ‘fundamentally corrupt’ after selling worthless insurance to up to two million customers. The victims included vulnerable customers who had contacted their bank after their credit card had been lost or stolen. They were then duped into paying for insurance to protect themselves against fraudulent transactions made on their replacement card. Claim: Banks have been branded ‘fundamentally corrupt’  after selling worthless card insurance (file photo) But the insurance was useless as banks are legally obliged to refund fraudulent payments to customers anyway. Typically the policies were sold when people contacted their banks for help over lost or stolen credit cards. Yesterday the City watchdog announced 11 lenders and credit card firms, including Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, HSBC and Santander, would have to pay compensation for the latest scandal to shame the High Street. Other big names to have been caught out include Tesco Personal Finance, The Co-operative Bank, Capital One and Clydesdale Bank. The Financial Conduct Authority said 2million customers who took out ‘card security’ policies will start receiving letters later this month informing them that they could be line for a pay-out. In many cases customers will have been shelling out annual premiums of between £20 and £40 for insurance they did not need. They could be in line for hundreds of pounds in compensation. Banks have already had to set aside more than £23billion to compensate customers duped into buying payment protection insurance – with Lloyds alone putting aside more than £11billion. Attack: Labour MP John Mann (left) said it 'sounds like fraud' and Lord Thurso (right) hit out at 'dodgy products' Last night MPs expressed exasperation at the banks’ latest transgressions. Lord Thurso, a former member of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, said: ‘You wonder when banks will learn their lessons and stop selling dodgy products. ‘This is yet another mis-selling scandal which underlines the conclusions we came to in the banking commission that the sales practices used by banks were fundamentally corrupt.’ There are striking similarities between the latest compensation package and a previous mis-selling scandal. Two years ago it was revealed that up to 7million people were sold card protection policies manufactured by a UK firm, CPP, by the major banks. A key, but entirely worthless part of these policies was they promised to provide insurance cover for customers if fraudulent transactions were made on their credit cards. Donna Ettridge (above right) took out a ‘Card Safe’ policy on her M&S credit card in 2001 – but only discovered 12 years later that it has been a waste of money. Mrs Ettridge, 54, was a regular shopper at M&S, had used an M&S credit card since 1986 and did not expect to be duped into buying insurance which was worthless. But she was telephoned by a salesman in 2001 and coerced into taking out the policy, even though M&S Bank automatically offers the fraud protection for free. Mrs Ettridge, a widow from Hornchurch, Essex, is not sure exactly how much she has paid for the policy over the years. But she said: ‘It makes me angry that I’ve paid out for something I did not need every three years for the last 12 years.’ Alok Sharma, a Conservative member of the Treasury Committee, said: ‘This is another awful example of banks mis-selling products. If the sector ever hopes to restore public trust, it needs to pull out all remaining skeletons from the cupboard.’ And Labour MP John Mann said: ‘This sounds like fraud. If this was any other walk of life they’d all be heading straight to prison. It’s very strange that banks haven’t even been fined for this.’ The insurance was provided by a little-known US firm called Affinion, based in Stamford, Connecticut. But the policies were widely sold by the banks, which received money for each sale. Now the High Street lenders face having to return hundreds of millions of pounds – plus 8 per cent interest – to customers. The compensation scheme has to be approved by customers and the High Court before it goes ahead. It will be available to anyone who bought Affinion’s policies between January 14 2005 and August 2013. Given names such as Card Protection, Sentinel Gold and Safe and Secure Plus, the policies cost £25 a year on average but range up to £40. After receiving an initial letter informing them about the compensation scheme, customers will be sent a follow-up letter in April or May providing them with a voting form. If they back the scheme, then a High Court hearing will take place on July 9 to approve it. Customers will then have seven months to fill out a form to request compensation, with the first pay-outs expected in the autumn. The FCA yesterday urged customers to vote for the scheme and said they will be provided with a dedicated helpline and website to assist them. But last night MP Alok Sharma raised concerns that victims could miss out. He said: ‘I do not think a seven-month time limit for claims is long enough.’ Yesterday RBS, Lloyds and Barclays refused to apologise to customers and HSBC declined to comment. A spokesman from Affinion, which has escaped a fine, said the FCA had not found any fault with the company.","11 firms including Lloyds, RBS, Barclays and HSBC to pay compensation .

"As a contender for Prime Minister, Ed Miliband’s comparison to the dopey Plasticine model Wallace is one he has always endeavoured to distance himself from. But doing so may prove easier said than done, because Aardman Animations – creators of Wallace and Gromit – have been rather mischievous in their latest film and included a character which bears an uncanny resemblance to the Labour leader. The advert trailer for Aardman’s latest Plasticine stop-animation children’s film Shaun the Sheep reveals a displeased waiter character with more than a passing likeness to Mr Miliband. Scroll down for video . Who's who? A new trailer for Aardman Animations' latest film, Shaun the Sheep, features a displeased waiter (left) who viewers believe bears a startling resemblance to Ed Miliband (right) The Wallace comparison has been a thorn in the side of Mr Miliband, who for years has fought to shake off the caricature, and with just under 100 days until election day, the film’s release next month is less than timely. Last year in a speech to launch Labour’s summer campaigning Mr Miliband even admitted the resemblance and said: ‘I am not from central casting. 'You can find people who are more square-jawed, more chiselled, look less like Wallace’. And in 2012 he told described himself as ‘somebody who looks a bit like Wallace from Wallace and Gromit’, before adding: ‘If spin doctors could design a politician, I suspect he wouldn’t look like me.’ It is an open secret in Westminster that Mr Miliband is worried about his poor public image – enough so to have hired help from a world renowned autism expert and a voice coach . Likening Mr Miliband to Wallace is an easy dig for the Tories, and during the Autumn Statement last year George Osborne took at swipe at Mr Miliband while explaining details of a tax credit for children’s television and animation production. Lookalike: The Labour leader (left) has been likened to Wallace (right) from Aardman's series of Wallace & Gromit films, but now appears to have a character all of his own . He said: ‘The man behind Wallace’s voice has retired. But after next May I am sure the whole House will unite behind a suitable and, by then, available candidate’. On the BBC Andrew Marr Show last year the Labour party leader was excruciatingly handed pictures of himself as an Aardman caricature, and he sought to laugh it off, telling the presenter: ‘I didn’t realise you were going to bring me present, that’s incredibly kind. I will show it to my kids.’ He went on to say that photo opportunities and charisma weren’t as important as raw policy, but Mr Marr told him: ‘You may hate it, you may think it is trivial, you may think it is awful, but it’s how things are done now. ‘Just as how in the Victorian period you had to stand up and make a three-hour speech in front of 300 people, now you have to do photo opportunities and deal with the internet and memes and so forth. ‘Therefore it is the job, it is the duty of a political leader to be better at it that you have been.

"Girls who drink more than one sugary drink a day are likely to start having periods sooner, say scientists. A new study of almost 6,000 adolescent girls links the consumption of sugary drinks to earlier menstruation. The research found those drinking more than 1.5 sugar-sweetened beverages a day had their first period 2.7 months earlier than those consuming two a week or fewer. The discovery is important as the risk of getting breast cancer later in life increases when periods start early. Scroll down for video . The research found those drinking more than 1.5 sugar-sweetened beverages a day had their first period 2.7 months earlier than those consuming two a week or fewer . Sugary drinks are also said to be contributing to the obesity epidemic in children. US lead researcher Dr Karin Michels, from Harvard Medical School, said ‘Our study adds to increasing concern about the widespread consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks among children and adolescents in the USA and elsewhere. ‘The main concern is about childhood obesity, but our study suggests that age of first menstruation (menarche) occurred earlier, independently of body mass index, among girls with the highest consumption of drinks sweetened with added sugar. ‘These findings are important in the context of earlier puberty onset among girls, which has been observed in developed countries and for which the reason is largely unknown.’ A one year reduction in age at first period is estimated to raise breast cancer risk by five per cent. The impact of bringing forward menarche by 2.7 months was likely to be ‘modest’ said the scientists. But they expected some girls to be consuming more sugary drinks than reported which would lead to an ‘even more dramatic’ drop in the age of menstruation. The researchers said there could be significant public health implications and, importantly, it was possible to encourage less sugary drink consumption. Altogether 5,583 girls were included in the research, drawn from a US-wide Growing Up Today study, says a report published in the journal Human Reproduction (must credit). Questionnaires were used to ask the girls about their diets at several points between 1996 and 2001, and collect information about what they drank. A drink serving was defined as either a can or a glass. Sugary drinks included drinks such as Coca Cola and Pepsi, sodas, fruit drinks, lemonade, iced tea and the powder mix Koolaid. The study found no link with fruit juices or diet colas with added sweeteners. By the end of the five year period, all but three per cent of the girls had started menstruating. The average first period age for girls consuming the most sugary drinks was 12.8 years compared with 13 years for those drinking the least. The average first period age for girls consuming the most sugary drinks was 12.8 years compared with 13 years for those drinking the least. After taking account of Body Mass Index (BMI), girls drinking the most were 22 per cent more likely to start their period in the month after being questioned about their diet than the lowest consumers. The researchers found artificially added sugar was chiefly responsible for their findings rather than natural sugars In fruit juices. Drinks with added sugar can lead to rapid ‘spikes’ of the hormone insulin. Boosted insulin can result in higher concentrations of sex hormones, and large changes in the levels of these have been linked to periods starting earlier, said the scientists. Dr Ken Ong, from the Medical Research Council Epidemiology Unit at Cambridge University, said ‘This is a very large study, which was representative across the USA, and the findings are strongly statistically significant. ‘From previous research we know that sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) intake promotes weight gain, and that weight gain promotes early puberty in girls. ‘The surprise here is the claim that the association is independent of childhood size - there is a more direct effect of SSB on puberty. This is unexpected.’ Prof Ieuan Hughes, Head of Paediatrics, University of Cambridge, questioned whether a difference of 2.7 months was ‘biologically relevant’. He said ‘The authors admit that future studies should examine the impact of early childhood nutrition on menarche. ‘It seems to me that the observation in this study suggests that it is weight related so that the message is clear about the dangers of such sugary drinks.’ A spokeswoman for the British Soft Drinks Association (BSDA), said: 'Neither this study nor the body of science shows that sugar-sweetened beverage consumption causes early onset of menstruation. 'What the body of science supports is that adolescent girls are reaching puberty earlier than prior generations; however, there is no scientific consensus concerning the cause of this trend.'","Those drinking 1.5 sugary drinks a day had first period 2.7 months earlier .

"A postman has been jailed for stealing hundreds of packages containing valuables and then making £15,500 by selling them online. Andrew Barratt, 49, took an estimated 400 items such as satnavs, digital cameras and computer games which his wife Michelle, 38, then auctioned on eBay. Their scam was foiled in April 2012 when Royal Mail investigators posted an iPad with a tracking device. It failed to arrive and was followed to their home in Stockport. Andrew Barratt, 49, was jailed for 15 months while his wife Michelle (left) was given 120 hours' unpaid work . Barratt, a postman for 14 years, was arrested in his uniform and has now been sacked. He was jailed for 15 months after admitting theft and converting criminal property. His wife was given 120 hours' unpaid work after pleading guilty to converting criminal property. At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Judge Leslie Hull said they had run 'a thoroughly dishonest scheme'. Barratt was arrested in his uniform and has now been sacked from his position as a postman at Royal Mail . Most of the items had been sent out by Amazon – which had reported around 2,000 lost packages in the postcodes where Barratt worked. An eBay account under the name 'ShellB76' run by Mrs Barratt was found to have sold 463 items – most of them electrical goods – since June 2010. Their retail value was almost £21,000. Two of the items – a camcorder and a Sony Walkman – had been reported stolen to police. She told detectives she had bought the items at car boot sales, despite the fact many of the sales were computer games which had been released just days earlier. The couple eventually pleaded guilty on the day of their trial. Defending Mr Barratt, Milena Bennett said he had stolen the goods while 'self-medicating' psoriasis with cannabis and amphetamines. A Royal Mail spokesman confirmed Barratt was sacked and said they seek to prosecute any members of staff who tampers with mail. He said: 'Royal Mail has a zero tolerance approach to any dishonesty and that stance is shared by the overwhelming majority of postmen and women. 'We will not allow the actions of any individual to damage the good reputation of our thousands of hard-working postmen and women. 'It is a criminal offence to tamper with or delay the delivery of mail and anyone caught doing so will face serious disciplinary measures. 'Royal Mail will always seek to prosecute the tiny minority of people who abuse their position of trust.'","Postman Andrew Barratt took about 400 items such as satnavs and iPads .

"Nicole Connolly and Michael Wright had a good life. They lived in a pleasant suburb about half an hour outside Perth, worked in jobs they enjoyed and earned enough to live comfortably. 'We had a pretty ""normal"" life. Michael  was a Civil Engineer and I owned a Day Spa. We lived in a nice house, in a nice suburb, life was… nice. But ""nice"" wasn't really cutting it for us,' Nicole told Daily Mail Australia. But three years ago the pair decided to pack it all in, sell everything they owned and head overseas on an indefinite holiday. Scroll down for video . Nicole Connolly, 39, and Michael Wright, 36, spend their lives travelling the world . The couple left their 'normal' lives in Perth to explore all corners of the earth, including Switzerland (pictured) They have been on the adventure for almost three years and have no intention of settling down anywhere . 'I lost a parent and as cliché as it may sound it made me look at my own life and ask myself the questions most of us ask ourselves when someone we love dies,' Nicole revealed. 'When I didn't like the answers to those questions we decided to make some rather large changes to our life.' Now they spend their days soaking up the sun in cities all around the world, travelling from place to place with no set itinerary, and Nicole, 39, and Michael, 36, have no intentions of heading home any time soon. The decision was a no-brainer for the pair who already had a taste for adventure and freedom, and spent much of the time leading up to their departure researching how others who had 'quit their lives' made it work. Nicole and Michael run travel blog Suitcase Stories and their work helps them to fund their travels . The couple's adventures have taken them to the UK, US, Europe, Asia and more. Pictured is Gangnam, Seoul . Nicole said 'I have always been a gypsy at heart' and remembers moving a lot when she was younger . She and Michael love the adventure, lack of structure and constant changes . Tokyo, Japan was one of Nicole's favourite places, as she had wanted to travel there since she was young . 'I have always been a gypsy at heart. My family moved around a lot when I was a child; a habit I continued as an adult, Nicole revealed from The Bahamas where she and Michael are currently living it up. 'I love change, I love discovering new places, and most of all I love freedom. Our lifestyle is all of that and so much more,' she added. 'Making the decision to travel full time was an easy one. We both loved travel and we had travelled a lot more than usual before we left Australia. 'However, after the decision was made the hard part was the planning, the saving and the waiting, Nicole said. Supporting their lifestyle through their travel blog Suitcase Stories and other business ventures, the pair have made it possible to sustain their adventures in the long term. 'At first we had our savings but that dwindled out pretty fast,' Nicole said. 'So we created an online business which allows us to work anywhere in the world as long as we have our laptops and WiFi. The income from the business supports our travels.' The pair also spend much of their time house-sitting for others, cutting their accomodation costs right down while experiencing the city they're living in from a local's perspective. The couple said making the decision to pack up their lives was not a difficult one. This is Tulum Beach in the Caribbean . It came after one of Nicole's parents passed away, which forced the couple to reevaluate their lives. Pictured is a stunning sunset in Langkawi, Malaysia . The pair spend much of their time house-sitting for others, cutting their accomodation costs right down . Nicole said it means they get to experience life from a local perpsective . She describes the couple's life as 'free, adventurous, exciting and perfect' Describing her lifestyle as 'free, adventurous, exciting and perfect' Nicole said the thing she loves most about the life is the adventure. 'I have thousands of memories from all of our experiences from the last three years that I will cherish forever. And we are free like never before,' she revealed. 'Yes we still work, but it’s on our own time, on our own terms. We can go where we want when we want; it doesn’t get much better than that! 'And I love that we never set an alarm clock!,' Nicole added. So far the couple have travelled around Europe, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States and Central and South America, the Caribbean and Asia. But on the cards are many more spots they would like to explore. The Perth couple still work so they have an income but enjoy it as it's on their own terms . So far the couple have travelled around Europe, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States . They have also been to the Caribbean, Asia and are currently kicking back in the Bahamas . One of the best parts of life according to Nicole is never having to set an alarm clock . She said the freedom of living life the way she and Michael do is almost indescribable . 'I have always wanted to visit Tahiti so that is on the list and Michael would love to go to Madagascar at some point,' Nicole revealed. 'There isn't a lot of structure because we like the freedom an open itinerary gives us. 'However, we have an idea of where we want to go for about 3 – 6 months in advance… It just doesn't always turn out the way we think it might as we have habit of changing our plans at the last minute,' she added. The pair save money by cooking their own meals or jumping on flights last minute at unusual times, but their successful business is what really keeps them going. 'It's cheaper to fly mid week than on the weekends so if you can be flexible you can save quite a bit of money on airfares and hotels this way,' Nicole said. The pair save money by cooking their own meals or jumping on flights last minute at unusual times . They live their lives without much structure or too much planning . They say being flexible is the key to leading such an adventurous lifestyle . The couple say they've had no second thoughts about their decision three years on and won't be going home . The highlight of Nicole's travels so far was the moment she stepped foot in a city she had yearned to visit for most of her life. 'I would have to say our visit to Japan was very surreal. I had been dreaming of traveling there since I was 10 years old when we had Japanese students stay with us,' Nicole said. 'I was fascinated by the stories they told, by their culture and way of life. So the day we arrived in Tokyo was a moment Ill never forget.' When asked if there had been any point in the past three years which made them question their drastic life change, Nicole said she couldn't think of one. 'No, as much as our family would love to hear that we are coming back, even for a visit, soon, we haven’t had any thoughts about returning yet.'","Nicole Connolly and Michael Wright packed up their life three years ago .

"It triggered unprecedented rumblings about his future as Prime Minister - but Tony Abbott is today standing by his decision to knight Prince Philip. But following public ridicule and dissension in his own ranks, Mr Abbott told reporters in Melbourne that he accepted people were upset with his decision. 'I stand by the decision. I understand why some people don't like it,' he said. 'I respect their right to be critical... and I take it on the chin, I take it on the chin.' His defence of the controversial decision on Wednesday immediately followed a meeting with another person honoured on Australia Day - domestic violence victim Rosie Batty, the Australian of the Year. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott (pictured today, left) was ridiculed after his decision to bestow a knighthood on Prince Philip (right, wearing top hat) on Australia Day . Mr Abbott said Prince Philip (right) had made a 'great contribution' to Australian society during his time . Meeting with Rosie Batty: Mr Abbott's statement today came after making a landmark announcement that the government would put domestic violence at the top of the agenda at the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) Outspoken media mogul Rupert Murdoch, Cabinet minister Barnaby Joyce, Queensland Premier Campbell Newman, the Northern Territory chief minister and two backbenchers all publicly criticised the 'captain's pick' on Tuesday - along with numerous unnamed colleagues. The prime minister - who confirmed he did not consult his own chief of staff Peta Credlin - said there would be 'considerable more consultation around these awards' in the future. His humility today was a far cry from his defence of the decision earlier this week, where he wrote off online criticism as merely 'electronic graffiti'. Mr Abbott said Prince Philip had made a 'great contribution' to Australian public life. He pointed to the thousands of Australians and the 1956 Melbourne Olympics as evidence of this. Queensland premier Campbell Newman, who is in the fight of his political life on the campaign trail, told reporters he disagreed with the decision and described it as a 'bolt from the blue'. Nationals deputy leader Barnaby Joyce told ABC Radio: 'I'm always of the strong belief that all awards should be for Australians'. Murdoch labelled the decision a 'joke and embarassment' in a Twitter post and called for knighthoods to be scrapped in Australia and in the United Kingdom. Political commentator Peter Van Onselen tweeted this morning: 'Based on chats with Libs this AM, for the 1st time (& i can't believe i'm saying this) I now don't think PM can make it to the next election.' Mr Abbott this morning met with another person officially honoured on Australia Day - Australian of the Year Rosie Batty. He announced the government would push for a national Domestic Violence Order scheme - meaning orders would apply across state borders. Ms Batty was appointed as a founding member to an advisory council for the Council of Australian Governments. Mr Abbott said COAG will place domestic violence at the top of its agenda for its next meeting. 'I am determined that this (naming Ms Batty as Australian of the Year) won't simply be a statement,' he said. Ms Batty was photographed in discussions with Mr Abbott and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women Michaela Cash, but did not appear at today's press conference.","Prime Minister Tony Abbott says he will consult more widely next time .

"A driver has claimed squirrels ‘ate’ his new Toyota Aygo after the firm began using eco-friendly plastics to boost its green credentials. Tony Steeles said his car was repeatedly attacked by the rodents only days after it was delivered. ‘The aerial’s been chewed off twice, the oxygen sensor’s been damaged and various rubber-like trim parts have been chewed and damaged,’ he told motoring magazine Auto Express. ‘The car’s been back for repairs four or five times.’ Hungry? A driver claims squirrels started 'eating' his Toyota Aygo - because of eco-friendly plastics . As no other vehicles parked nearby have been attacked, Mr Steeles, from Croydon, south London, questioned whether Toyota’s use of plant-based plastics might be attracting the hungry squirrels. Door trims, seat cushions, spare tyre covers and boot liners are among the parts that the Japanese firm now makes with materials derived from natural sources, such as the castor oil plant. Mr Steeles’s dealer, Jemca Croydon, insisted there was no link between his car’s plastics and the rodent attacks. But it paid for the repairs each time he returned the car, and eventually swapped it for a new Toyota Yaris. A Toyota spokesman told Auto Express that the problem was ‘unusual’, adding: ‘We have very few complaints of this occurring in the UK.’ However, he said the firm’s research and development teams would ‘investigate if any improvements can be made to the design of our products to deter rodents’. Tasty: The Toyota Aygo is one of several cars being made with the new range of eco-friendly plastics . Auto Express editor-in chief, Steve Fowler, said: ‘It’s an admirable eco trend to manufacture car parts from plants, but could this green-fingered fad be making new motors irresistible to hungry wildlife? ‘We’ve always thought the Toyota Aygo was a tasty little car, but this is really taking the biscuit – or plant-based parcel shelf.’ Mr Steeles said he wasn’t taking any chances with his new Yaris, and now stores it in a garage overnight. Toyota is not the only car manufacturer embracing unusual new materials. Ford announced last year that it was working with food giant Heinz to see if dried tomato skins left over from making ketchup could be used to develop an alternative to petroleum-based plastic. And British sports car maker Lotus has experimented with body panels made from hemp fibres. Food sources such as soy, peanut oil and even rice husks are used by some manufacturers, according to Auto Express.","Tony Steeles, from Croydon, London, said rodents arrived within days .

"Some breakfast cereals contain as much sugar as seven and a half chocolate fingers per portion, campaigners warned last night. They said such high levels fuel childhood obesity and show the Government is not keeping the industry in check. Experts claim many manufacturers are ignoring advice to cut sugar, which has been dubbed the new tobacco over fears that it could become as big a national health problem as cigarettes. Sweets for breakfast? Kellogg's Frosties and Crunchy Nut each contain about nine teaspoons of sugar per 100g - making them each about one-third pure sugar. Experts warn sugar poses a national health problem . Some products actually contain far more sugar than they did three years ago, according to research by the campaign group Action On Sugar. It found 14 out of 50 cereals were at least a third sugar – 33.3g per 100g, or eight teaspoons in each serving. Action On Sugar nutritionist Kawther Hashem said: ‘You wouldn’t give your child chocolate biscuits for breakfast, yet certain manufacturers are effectively doing that for us.’ The worst offender was Aldi’s Harvest Morn Choco Rice at 39g per 100g, which was up by 18 per cent since a survey by the consumer group Which? in 2012. Morrisons Honey & Nut Corn Flakes and Sainsbury’s Honey Nut Corn Flakes came in at 36.3g per 100g – up by 8 per cent compared with three years ago, although this is disputed. The amount in Kellogg’s Frosties was 37g per 100g and that for its Crunchy Nut was 25g per 100g, neither of which has changed. Full of sugar: The worst offender was Aldi’s Harvest Morn Choco Rice at 39g per 100g. Morrisons Honey & Nut Corn Flakes and Sainsbury’s Honey Nut Corn Flakes came in at 36.3g per 100g . Graham MacGregor, chairman of Action On Sugar and professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary University of London, said: ‘Children quickly become used to high-sugar cereals and find healthier ones less palatable, which has long-term implications on their health. Too much sugar leads to weight gain, raising the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and some cancers.’ He said the food industry had lobbied the Government to water down a voluntary scheme called the Responsibility Deal designed to make products less unhealthy, adding: ’One of the greatest failures in tackling obesity is the Government’s appeasement of the food industry. ‘The Responsibility Deal, which allows the food industry to regulate themselves – likened to Dracula being put in control of the blood bank – has failed. It’s time for it to be scrapped.’ Kellogg’s said the sugar in its cereals was to a tiny proportion of daily consumption. Sainsbury’s said it had not increased the sugar in Honey Nut Corn Flakes, but had recalculated, which had led to a higher figure. Morrisons said its Honey & Nut Corn Flakes had not changed and could not explain the increase. From next month it will have 8 per cent less sugar. Aldi also said it would reduce the sugar content of its cereals.","Experts accuse food firms of ignoring official advice to cut sugar .

"Defense lawyers say they're negotiating with prosecutors for a plea deal in the case of a Utah woman accused of killing six of her newborn babies and storing their bodies in her garage. A hearing in the case of 39-year-old Megan Huntsman was delayed for two weeks Monday. She faces six counts of murder in the deaths that spanned 10 years after the corpses were discovered by her estranged husband when he cleaned the garage last April. Striking a deal? Megan Huntsman, 39, who is accused of killing six of her seven newborns and storing all of their bodies in her garage, is in talks with prosecutors to strike a plea deal (pictured in court in December) Defense attorney Jennifer Foresta said the two sides are working on the matter, The Daily Herald of Provo reports. Judge Darold McDade says the case could be resolved in the hearing rescheduled for February 9. Police have alleged Huntsman was addicted to methamphetamine when she killed the six infants over 10 years. Investigators say husband Darren West is the babies' father, but he isn't a suspect. Troubled: Police believe Huntsman was addicted to methamphetamine and didn't want to care for the babies . Crime scene: Police tape the front of the house where the infant bodies were found in Pleasant Grove, Utah . Appearing in court on Monday for an arraignment hearing, Huntsman did not enter any pleas due to the ongoing negotiations. 'We're not ready to set trial and we're not ready for a plea yet,' Deputy Utah County Attorney Jared Perkins said outside of court. Perkins said plea negotiations have been 'pretty smooth,' but attorneys wanted to give Huntsman more time to consider her options before resolving the case.

"A Texas nanny was busy changing a little girl's diaper Monday when she was shocked to hear a stranger's voice come over the baby monitor. As professional baby sitter Ashley Stanley, of Houston, quickly discovered, someone had hacked into the surveillance system installed inside her employers' home and was now spying on the woman and her 1-year-old charge, Samantha. Stanley said at first she heard a strange noise in Samantha's room, but initially she could not identify its source. Scroll down for videos . Privacy violation: Houston nanny Ashley Stanley was changing litle Samantha's diaper Monday when a stranger's voice came over the baby monitor . Peeping Tom: Someone had hacked into the surveillance system installed inside her employers' home and was now spying on Stanley and her 1-year-old charge, Samantha . Idle chatter: The hacker made some comments about the toddler and her 'poopy diaper,' and even urged Stanley to password-protect the camera . A short time later, the unsuspecting nanny was startled by a man's disembodied voice talking to her and making comments about her actions. Stanley's first thought was that her employers were playing a prank on her, but she quickly realized that was not the case. 'They kept telling me that it's a cute baby and 'wow, that is a poopy diaper,' Stanley told the station KPRC. 'I was like, 'My goodness, are they watching me like right now?' The nanny said the brazen intruder went so far as to tell her that she should password-protect the camera. The security system manufactured by a company called Foscam was installed by Samantha's parents so they could remotely keep an eye on their toddler at work via their smartphones. The small round camera is trained on Samantha's crib and can be manipulated to survey the entire room and even the hallway. Watching you: The camera is trained on Samantha's crib and can be manipulated to survey the entire room and even the hallway . Hands-on parents: The security system was installed by Samantha's parents so they could remotely keep an eye out on their toddler via their smartphones . The family were under the impression that the camera could only be accessed on a mobile app when the owners' phones were on the network, but apparently it was not so. Foscam COO Chase Rhymes told the station KHOU their customers are always urged to change the default password and username upon purchasing a camera. It appears that the person who snooped on Ashley Stanley and little Samantha Monday hacked into the surveillance system, which may constitute a federal crime. Since the incident , Stanley and the toddler's parents have unplugged the camera to make sure no one spies on their child. Creepy: The website insecam.com is running footage from more than 73,000 cameras round the world including this kitchen .

"Energy firm EDF has announced a price cut of just 1.3 per cent – less than 18p a week - on gas tariffs . Energy firm EDF has announced a puny price cut of just 1.3per cent – less than 18p a week - in a devastating snub to customers. The reduction on gas tariffs is worth a saving of just £9 on the average annual household energy bill and is tiny in the context of a sharp fall in wholesale energy prices. Wholesale gas prices are down by around 28per cent in a year and electricity by 15per cent, which could deliver annual savings of £140 if they were passed on in full. EDF, which is a subsidiary of a power company owned by the French government, is the last of the ‘big six’ suppliers to announce a cut in tariffs in the last two weeks. Earlier reductions of around 5per cent and less by the other five – British Gas, SSE, Npower, Eon and Scottish Power – have all been derided as too little and too late. However, none have done so little as EDF with a reduction that is so small as to make no real difference to the one million customers on standard variable rate tariffs who will receive it. At the same time customers will not get the benefit of the reduction until February 11 and after the snow storms predicted for the next few days have passed. EDF’s minuscule price cut also represents a snub to the Chancellor George Osborne and other ministers, who have demanded energy firms pass on falls in their costs to customers. Mr Osborne, who recently took to Twitter to say it was ‘vital’ that the price cuts are passed, has ordered a Treasury investigation to make sure this happens. The tiny reduction announced by EDF suggests the company does not expect any kind of sanction. The company defended the small reduction saying that it was unable to cut further because it had bought a lot of gas and electricity at the high prices that existed before the falls over the past year. Other companies have tried to blame Labour and its pledge to freeze prices until 2017 should the party win the General Election in May for the smaller than warranted reductions. The firms suggest that they are unable to cut deeper because they fear being locked into low prices that will hit their profits over the long term. The Conservative Energy and Business minister Matt Hancock suggested the recent price cuts, including the one from EDF, were ‘very encouraging’. However, consumer experts condemned the energy giants for turning the screw on customers in the teeth of the winter. Stephen Murray, energy expert at MoneySuperMarket, described the 1.3per cent reduction as ‘paltry’. The reduction on gas tariffs is worth a saving of just £9 on the average annual household energy bill and is tiny in the context of a sharp fall in wholesale energy prices, which are down by around 28 per cent in a year . He said: ‘It was inevitable that we would see the final of the ‘big six’ cut its prices this week and this is truly the most underwhelming of the lot EDF Energy. On top of that, we see that bill payers will again not feel the full benefit of lower bills immediately. ‘EDF’s customers will see overall energy bills fall by just £9 a year if paying by monthly direct debit – down to £1,155 a year. ‘That is an absolutely paltry price cut in comparison to the fall in wholesale prices that we have seen.’ He added: ‘It’s been frustrating to see all but one of the big six choose to delay a cut in prices. They have all ensured that they gain a few extra week at higher prices when energy consumption by consumers remains high in the colder weather.’ Ann Robinson, Director of Consumer Policy at uSwitch.com, said the EDF announcement confirms that the 60per cent of households who are on variable rate tariffs are not getting a fair deal. ‘These meagre reductions are too little too late and must be increased to help hard-pressed consumers struggling with their energy bills this winter,’ she said. She said householders must now take matters into their own hands and switched to fixed rate deals that can offer annual savings of more than £300 a year. The industry regulator Ofgem is so concerned that energy firms are charging rip-off prices that it has referred them to a full-blown inquiry by the Competition & Markets Authority. However, this will take at least six months and currently, Ofgem has no powers to force the industry to pass on a fair reductions in tariffs. Mark Todd, director of energyhelpline.com, said: ‘This is a price cut so small you’d probably need a microscope to see it. Consumers will struggle to notice it in their next energy bills.’ The EDF chief executive, Vincent de Rivaz, said: ‘We continue to look for ways to bear down on costs for customers and will offer more help to the most vulnerable, for example encouraging them to switch to fixed tariffs. ‘If wholesale gas prices create cost reductions which allow further price cuts these will be passed to customers as soon as possible.’ Business and Energy minister, Matt Hancock, said: ‘Energy bills are falling. It’ s very encouraging that all major suppliers are now passing on savings from lower global gas prices. Of course I will continue to meet with the big firms to make sure that hardworking households are getting a fair deal. ‘This case is by no means closed and we will be watching the global gas markets very closely, expecting to see any further savings passed on.’ Lib-Dem Energy Secretary, Ed Davey, said: ‘People want to see bigger savings now and energy companies need to up their game if they want their customers to stick around.’ Caroline Flint MP, Labour’s Shadow Energy and Climate Change Secretary, said: ‘Given wholesale gas prices have fallen by at least 20 per cent, a measly price cut of just 1.3 per cent is yet more evidence of why we need a tough new regulator with the power to ensure that energy companies pass on the full savings from falls in wholesale costs to all consumers, as Labour has proposed.’","Energy firm EDF has announced price cut of just 1.3per cent on gas tariffs .

"The off-camera drama on The View continues with a new report detailing why executives at ABC decided to keep Rosie Perez on the daytime talk show. News of the network's decision leaked earlier this month before a formal announcement had been made while Perez was busy in rehearsal for her role in Larry David's new play Fish in the Dark, leading to immediate backlash not just from the public, but also Perez's good friend and View co-host Rosie O'Donnell. Now, Perez will stay on the show with a source close to ABC executives claiming that the network wants to avoid 'an Ann Curry situation.' Scroll down for video . ABC has reportedly decided to not fire Rosie Perez (above) from The View despite reports earlier this month that she would be ousted . The ABC talk show (above) is reportedly trying to avoid an 'Ann Curry situation' Variety, who first broke the news of Perez's ousting from the talk show, reports that the actress may now stay on until August, when her contract is up. The firing of Curry from Today in 2012 ended up being a disaster for the struggling NBC morning news show, with the longtime anchor's sudden departure and tearful farewell reflecting poorly on the once popular program and its cheerful and positive image. ABC had reportedly hoped to avoid this by making it seem as if Perez was leaving the program because of her commitments to David's highly anticipated new play, which will begin previews in New York City on February 2. The news broke however before they could even tell the other co-hosts,  and when O'Donnell confronted her bosses about what was happening the 'network backpedaled on the plan,' also concerned about the hit they might take for firing the Latina Perez just four months in and having not vetted any other candidates to replace her. Perez will now return from her month off on February 3. Perez has been off the past month as she rehearses her role in Larry David's new play . A spokesperson for ABC denied these reports, saying; 'These unnamed sources are wrong. As was always the plan, the amazingly talented Rosie Perez took time off to rehearse for her Broadway play. We’re eagerly looking forward to having her back on February 3rd. Any speculation to the contrary is simply untrue.' The program continues to struggle in the ratings, and has begun to be outperformed by their CBS rival The Talk. 'It’s never been such a mess,' says one insider. 'Nobody knows what’s going on.'","News broke in mid-January that The View would be firing Rosie Perez .

"Elizabeth Shepherd was applauded as she was hailed an Apprenticeship Ambassador at the Labour conference, but has not heard from the party since . She was one of eight ‘ordinary’ voters whose story of struggle was said to have inspired Ed Miliband and his fight against the Tories. Indeed, when she was twice asked to stand and receive a round of applause at the Labour Party conference last September Elizabeth Shepherd was feted as the face of new apprentices. And the Labour leader was clearly so smitten with the 21-year-old from Bolton that within hours it was announced he wanted her to be an ‘Apprenticeship Ambassador.’ But it seems that Elizabeth has been rather forgotten by the Labour leader and his team. Yesterday it emerged that Elizabeth has become fully qualified as an auto-electrician and been given a job by the First Group transport firm after finishing her apprenticeship studies at Manchester College. But it was also revealed that she has heard absolutely nothing from Mr Miliband and his team about becoming their much vaunted  ‘Ambassador.’ Interviewed by broadcaster Nick Ferrari on his LBC breakfast programme yesterday she was asked about David Cameron’s plans for increased apprenticeships for the young. She praised the Cameron scheme but then she said: ‘You know I’ve still not heard back from Ed regarding being an apprenticeship ambassador so I’m not sure yet who I will vote for.’ Pressed by the radio host about her contact with Miliband and his Labour team, she was asked by Ferrari : ‘They (Labour) said they wanted to make you an apprenticeship ambassador. How much contact has there been since then?’ ‘Not really any – I’ve not heard anything since that,’ replied Miss Shepherd. Last September – fully four months ago - Mr Miliband extolled the virtues of his eight ‘ordinary voters - including Miss Shepherd – during his conference speech in Manchester. ‘I met somebody called Elizabeth the other day,’ he excitedly told the audience. ‘Where is she? She’s here. Elizabeth why don’t you stand up for one second…’ Since the conference Miss Shepherd has  qualified as an auto-electrician after finishing her apprenticeship studies at Manchester College - but said she may not vote for Miliband after he failed to contact her . Mr Miliband then called for a second round of applause for Miss Shepherd during his rambling speech and later she was told that he definitely wanted her to be a Labour ‘Apprenticeship Ambassador.’ The suggestion that the Labour leader wanted to ‘promote’ Miss Shepherd was widely reported at the time of the Conference. But shortly after her appearance she perhaps showed some prescience about political promises when she was asked who she might vote for In May and replied: . ‘You can’t really say until they are in power - when they go back on the words they say. I’m keeping an open mind to see what’s best for me personally.’ Last night a Labour party spokesman said: ‘We have spoken to Manchester College about Elizabeth since September and we will be contacting her directly.’","Miliband hailed Elizabeth Shepherd as an inspiration in fight against Tories .

"The arrival of hundreds of fire-wielding Vikings would usually cause some serious and legitimate concern. But this particular procession of armoured warriors in the Shetland Islands marked an annual tradition dating back to the 1800's - the Up Helly Aa festival. Dozens of 'squads' descended on the small town of Lerwick in a proud nod to the archipelago's Norse heritage. They dragged a specially made Viking Galley through the town's streets and eventually set it ablaze, before indulging in night of partying. Scroll down for video . Up Helly Aa: Hundreds of men dressed up as Vikings to celebrate in a nod to the Shetland Islands' Norse heritage . Procession: Hundreds of men - known as guizers for the day - paraded through the streets with fiery torches . Tradition: At the end of the route, all the marching guizers surround a specially-made Viking galley which they have dragged through Lerwick . One of a kind: A host of volunteers toil from October to construct the galley as well as the thousands of torches being carried . Fiery end: After the singing of the Up Helly Aa song, the guizers throw their torches into the galley . Spectacle: Once the galley has burned and the flames die down, guizers sing the traditional song 'The Norseman's Home' before indulging in a night of partying . Stunning: Fireworks erupt over Lerwick as the Viking galley below is set ablaze by hundreds of men dressed as vikings . Hundreds of play-actors known as 'guizers' follow the main man known as a Jarl, who on this occasion was Neil Robertson. After nightfall, all other squads would follow his with torches in hand, dragging with them a massive Viking ship. When all the torch-bearers arrive at the route's end, they form a circle around the galley and singe the traditional Up Helly Aa song. Once the song is complete, all the guizers throw their torches into the galley in a beautiful, fiery nod to their Norse heritage. The sing another traditional song known as 'the Norseman's Home' before descending on the town for a night of drinking - and more singing.

Heritage: Up Helly Aa is a chance for multiple generations on the Shetland Isles to celebrate their Norse heritage . Work begins as early as October to ensure that everything is ready in time for the celebrations which often continue until 8am the following day. It may seem dangerous but the celebration as it happens evolved from the genuinely hazardous tradition of 'tar barrelling'. It is thought squads of young men would drag barrels of burning tar through the town on sledges, before it was abolished between 1874 and 1880. Permission was eventually granted to carry torches with the first procession taking place in 1876 and the first Up Helly Aa parade in 1881.","Dozens of 'squads' of men dressed as Nordic warriors paraded through the town of Lerwick in the Shetland Islands .

"Ed Miliband's decision to make the NHS the central theme of Labour’s general election campaign was dealt a series of heavy blows yesterday. Two former Labour health secretaries raised fears about the strategy, and new figures showed a dramatic surge in public satisfaction with the Health Service – especially among Labour voters. On a disastrous day for the Labour leader who has said he will ‘weaponise’ the NHS during the campaign: . ÷ Figures leaked to the Daily Mail show the number of people satisfied with the Health Service is at its second highest ever level, while unhappiness is at a record low. Scroll down for video . Under pressure: Support for the NHS in Britain is at its highest level ever, with the exception of 2010, with Labour voters among the most praise-heavy, as Miliband attacked the Tories over the health service . ÷ Alan Milburn said Mr Miliband’s NHS-focused campaign could be a fatal mistake and was a pale imitation of Neil Kinnock’s losing effort in 1992 – and risked the same result. ÷ Alan Johnson warned that political parties needed to be careful about doom-laden language on the NHS. ÷ And Mr Miliband came under further pressure over the poor state of the Labour-run NHS in Wales, where waiting times for A&E, operations and ambulance response are far worse than in England. Yesterday the Labour leader claimed the NHS was facing its most perilous moment in a generation, while shadow health secretary Andy Burnham claimed it was on a downward spiral. But figures from the annual British Social Attitudes survey, to be published later this week by health think-tank The King’s Fund, showed that 65 per cent of people were happy with the way the Health Service worked. That is up five points in a year and beaten only once before, in 2010. Dissatisfaction, meanwhile, fell in 2014 to a record low of 15 per cent. The biggest surge in satisfaction with the NHS is among Labour voters, where there has been an 11 point increase to 69 per cent. Satisfaction among Lib Dem supporters is up by five points to 68 per cent, and is static among Conservatives at 67 per cent. The survey, which has been conducted since 1983, found that satisfaction with outpatient services is at an all-time high of 69 per cent. Accident and emergency services experienced an increase in satisfaction to 58 per cent, from last year’s low point of 53 per cent, despite controversy over failures to meet waiting-time targets in recent months. However, while GP services remain the most popular NHS service in terms of satisfaction, their rating of 71 per cent in 2014 is the lowest since the survey began. Satisfaction with dentists remains lower than with other NHS services, with 54 per cent of respondents happy. And happiness with social care services is far lower than with the NHS, with just 31 per cent of respondents content and 30 per cent dissatisfied. Experts say the unexpected rise in overall satisfaction ratings is significant, although they caution that some of it may be due to voters’ desire to express support for the institution. Mr Burnham, in a speech at The King’s Fund to launch his party’s new ten-year manifesto for health, insisted: ‘If we don’t change course, the crisis we are seeing now in A&E and the ambulance service will become entrenched in the NHS.’ Ed Miliband’s comparison to the dopey Plasticine model Wallace is one he has always tried to distance himself from. But he may face a fresh round of jokes now Aardman Animations, which created Wallace and Gromit, has included a character in its new film with an uncanny resemblance to the Labour leader. Uncanny: New character from Aardman Animations' new film (left), and Labour leader Ed Miliband (right) The trailer for Shaun The Sheep reveals a displeased waiter with more than a passing likeness to Mr Miliband – and with under 100 days until the election, the film’s release next month is less than timely for the Opposition leader. In the last Autumn Statement, George Osborne took a swipe at Mr Miliband, saying: ‘The man behind Wallace’s voice has retired. But after next May I am sure the whole House will unite behind a suitable and, by then, available candidate.’ He warned that if the Tories won the election, ‘the next Parliament could see the NHS sunk by a toxic mix of cuts, crisis and privatisation’. Labour may hit private healthcare companies with a new levy to help pay for training extra NHS staff, and is proposing to integrate care for the elderly into the NHS in an attempt to ease the pressure on hospitals caused by inadequate community support. Mr Miliband repeated a pledge made last year to hire 36,000 extra health staff, paid for with an additional £2.5billion a year from a new tax on expensive homes, a levy on tobacco firms and a crackdown on tax avoidance. However, the Labour leader also appeared to suggest his ‘mansion tax’ would be used to help pay down the deficit even though it has already been earmarked for NHS spending. His push on the NHS was further undermined by an extraordinary attack from Mr Milburn, who was a health secretary under Tony Blair and is a leading Blairite figure. He said Labour’s focus on extra funding for the NHS without plans to deliver necessary reform could prove to be a fatal mistake, and showed the party was sticking too closely to its comfort zone. Ed Miliband said Thatcher's move to bring in private firms to run  energy companies should not be the future model for the NHS . Margaret Thatcher’s privatisations of state-owned facilities in the Eighties were botched, Ed Miliband suggested yesterday. He said the move to bring private firms in to run services such as energy should not be used as a model for the future of the NHS. Referring to part of the Tories’ Health and Social Care Act, he said: ‘Believe it or not, Section 75 actually said the model for the NHS should be the great success of the privatised utilities in the Eighties. Now, we know where that got us, don’t we?’ Tories claimed the remarks showed the Labour leader instinctively favoured state intervention. But speaking in Sale, Manchester, he said he had no intention of taking utilities back to state ownership, adding: ‘No. That’s not our plan and it’s never been our plan. ‘What’s important is to recognise what this Government is doing in relation to the Health Service. They thought the model of competition, privatisation, fragmentation was the answer. It isn’t.’ Tim Knox, of the Centre for Policy Studies, said: ‘Of all Margaret Thatcher’s achievements, it is easy to forget how successful was her programme of privatisation. 'Not only did the taxpayer benefit, but so did the consumer – in lower prices and better service.’ ‘There is a risk that Labour’s position on the National Health Service becomes almost an emblem for Labour showing an unwillingness to lean into a difficult reform agenda,’ he told Radio 4’s World At One. Alan Johnson, Mr Burnham’s predecessor as health secretary under Gordon Brown, warned of the political risks of sounding doom-laden on the NHS. He told the BBC: ‘There are risks – and I know from my constituents that if you criticise the NHS in a way that the public believes is actually undermining it then you run a political risk.’ In Wales, Labour has presided over long waiting times for vital tests and life-saving treatment. A key cancer waiting time target has not been met since 2008. But Mr Miliband bizarrely claimed the NHS performance in Wales could only be compared to when the Tories were last in power before 1997, rather than to the service in England.","Ed Miliband attacked Tories over handling of the health service in speech .

The rebel fighters celebrated after placing two white flags of their Fajr al-Hurreya brigade (Dawn of Freedom) on top of a hill in Kobane. Other flags on the hill were from the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), who helped defeat the militants. Kurdish fighters are now rebuilding the town on the Syria-Turkey border after bravely expelling IS with the assistance of American-led Coalition forces. The four-month battle culminating in the 'defeat' of the insurgents was a significant victory for both the Kurds and the Coalition forces who trained them. The children who fled the streets of the city to escape the threat of Islamic State terrorists are now returning home to find their homes in ruins. Many of their homes, schools and hospitals  fell inside the battle zone and were subsequently destroyed in the months of fighting. Scroll down for video .

Returning home: Residents who fled to Turkey to escape the fighting are beginning to trickle back home to help in the rebuilding effort . Triumph: The Kobane they are returning to will look very different . On Monday, a Kurdish militia group known as the People's Protection Units (YPG) said Kobane had been 'completely liberated' from Islamic State, who it refers to using the pejorative Arabic acronym 'Daesh'. A statement on their website read: 'The defeat of Daesh in Kobani will be the beginning of the end for the group.' IS's failure to capture the town was a major blow for the extremists whose hopes of an easy victory was disrupted by Coalition air-strikes and a resilient Kurdish militia. Kurdish official Idriss Nassan said: 'Daesh gambled on Kobani and lost. Their defenses have collapsed and its fighters have fled.' The few civilians who remained in the city while fighting continued joined in the celebrations with Kurdish fighters. Most of the original 60,000 residents had already escaped to Turkey and there is no telling when they can return to their homes. Meanwhile US officials have have not been able to confirm Kurdish fighters have fully gained control of Kobane, but they have no reason to disbelieve their claims. The Kurds now control around 90 per cent of the town and particularly the central and southern areas, according to a senior US official. The official admits there is still a considerable Islamic State presence in the outlying areas of Kobane, where they continue to battle pockets of Kurdish fighters.

Proud: Kurdish people celebrate in a massive rally near the Turkish-Syrian border . Elation: While inside the city, Kurdish citizens returning home also celebrate their liberation . Kurdish officials and activists have said it is entirely in Kurdish hands with only sporadic fighting on the outer edges in the east where the militants retained some control. According to the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the  (YPG) are searching houses in the eastern suburbs to dismantle and detonate bombs left behind. Capturing Kobane would have given  IS militants control of the border-crossing with Turkey and allowed direct lines for their positions along the frontier. In September, Islamic State fighters began invading around 300 Kurdish villages including Kobane which sent tens of thousands of residents fleeing into Turkey. The town became a centre-piece for the international campaign against the militants which inspired US Secretary of State John Kerry to say it would be 'morally very difficult' not to help the town. Reduced to rubble: The once populous town of Kobane has been decimated by months of fighting . Routing bombing: An average of six Coalition air-strikes on IS locations a day also destroyed homes and vehicles . Wreckage: The destruction in Kobane, following a four month-long battle with IS is widespread . Roaming free: A man in military fatigues rides around Kobane with relative safety . The American-led air assault began on September 21 and Kobane itself was the target of about half a dozen daily air-strikes on average.

"One of Australia’s top gynaecologists is under investigation for allegedly slapping a nurse in front of a patient. Professor Margaret Davy has ‘strongly denied any wrongdoing’ as it was confirmed by South Australia Health Minister Jack Snelling that the reported incident is being looked into by officials. Prof Davy has taken almost a year’s holiday from her job as head of surgery at the Royal Adelaide Hospital, in South Australia, as the investigation gets under way, The Advertiser reports. Professor Margaret Davy (stock image shown) has ‘strongly denied any wrongdoing’ after being accused of slapping a nurse at the Royal Adelaide Hospital . The Royal Adelaide Hospital did not deny an investigation is under way but said they could not comment . She told the paper she had no knowledge of the alleged incident, which supposedly happened during a colposcopy procedure when the patient was conscious, and revealed that she has gone on long service leave. ‘I have definitely not resigned as I have 354 days of long service leave so I have a year to think about it,’ Prof Davy told The Advertiser. The Royal Adelaide Hospital did not deny an investigation is happening when contacted by Daily Mail Australia, but a spokesperson said: ‘We are not making any further comment.’ Daily Mail Australia has also contacted Prof Davy for comment. South Australia Health Minister Jack Snelling (pictured) said that the reported incident is being looked into by officials . Mr Snelling told The Advertiser: ‘I am advised that a formal investigation is under way into this serious allegation. ‘If found to be true I would expect appropriate disciplinary action to be taken.’ Prof Davy, 69, has had a long and successful career in the world of gynaecology. She graduated from the University of Adelaide and went on to work in Oslo, Norway, for ten years at the Norwegian Radium Hospital where she gained extensive knowledge about gynaecological cancer.

"A drug costing up to £9million per patient is to be made available on the NHS - making it the health service's most expensive medicine. Eculizumab - also known as Soliris - will be offered to about 200 people suffering from a rare kidney condition, the treatments watchdog confirmed last night. The National Institute for Health Care and Excellence (Nice) said the drug – which will cost the NHS up to £82million a year – would allow patients to live independently for decades. A Nice spokeswoman confirmed last night that the drug would be the most expensive funded by the NHS. Sir Andrew Dillon, left, of the National Institute for Health Care and Excellence (NICE), said he was pleased to have authorised the new 'wonder' drug Soliris, also known as Eculizumab, to treat a rare kidney condition . The drug will treat atypical Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (aHUS) - a life-threatening disease affecting around hundreds of people in England. It causes inflammation of blood vessels and the formation of blood clots throughout the body. There are only around 200 sufferers, with 20 to 30 new patients with the condition diagnosed each year. Currently there are about 56 patients receiving the drug through a temporary agreement with NHS England. Patients are constantly at risk of sudden damage and failure of their vital organs, particularly the kidneys. Nice said the drug – which will be funded on an interim basis - was a 'significant innovation' and offered 'gains of a magnitude that is rarely seen for any new drug treatment'. Its chief executive Sir Andrew Dillon conceded the drug would prove to be 'very expensive' and recommended NHS England  find ways of reducing the cost. The decision to provide Eculizumab, developed and marketed by US firm Alexion Pharmaceuticals, was only approved on the basis of ultra-rare conditions, rather than being assessed on its standard value-for-money formula. Atypical Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (aHUS) is a life-threatening disease affecting around 200 people in England. It causes severe damage to the kidneys, pictured, leading to kidney failure in some patients . The health watchdog said that it was unfair to apply the usual rules because it was such a rare condition – meaning drug companies had to recoup their research costs from only a handful of patients. With the drug offering an extra 25 years of good-quality life, Nice deemed it worth the annual £340,000 cost per patient to the NHS. Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a rare, life-threatening, genetic disease. It causes damage to the vital organs, the kidneys, heart and brain in particular. Although the condition does affect children, around a half of sufferers are adults. The condition affects the immune system and in sufferers. Scientists believe an abnormality in proteins in the immune system causes cells along blood vessel walls to become damaged. Platelets become overactive and blood clots form in tiny blood vessels throughout the body. Clots can block the flow of blood, create inflammation and travel to other organs, causing further damage. aHUS is caused by changes or mutations in the genes that produce proteins that help control the part of the body's immune system. The changes cause that part of the immune system to attack the body doing great damage to vital organs if left untreated. Symptoms of the condition include diarrhoea, nausea and vomitting, shortness of breath, fatigue, heart and kidney abnormalities. aHUS causes damage to the kidneys, causing many sufferers to require long-term dialysis or a kidney transplant if their kidneys stop working. Other complications include high blood pressure, around half of patients will experience neurological symptoms, four in 10 will suffer heart problems, while almost a third will have diarrhoea and other digestive problems. Source: ahussource.com . But the decision will come as a blow to cancer patients after a quarter of treatments that can offer a few extra months of life were stopped on cost grounds this month. Sir Andrew Dillon said: 'aHUS is a very distressing condition that imposes a significant burden both on those with the condition and their carers and families. 'We are therefore pleased to be able to recommend Eculizumab for funding. 'The Committee accepted that Eculizumab is a step change in the management of aHUS and can be considered a significant innovation for a disease with a high un-met clinical need.' He added: 'The drug is, however, very expensive. The Committee felt that the budget impact of Eculizumab would be lower if the potential for adjusting the dose of the drug and stopping treatment was explored. 'This is reflected in the guidance which recommends Eculizumab should be funded only if important conditions are met, including the development of rules for starting and stopping treatment for clinical reasons. 'In the meantime NHS England and the company should consider what opportunities might exist to reduce the cost of Eculizumab to the NHS.' Research has shown that Eculizumab is an effective treatment, which can block the faulty part of the immune system, stopping it causing the cell damage. Kidney Research UK said the drug has been 'proven to prevent kidney failure' in patients with newly diagnosed aHUS. 'Without it, their kidneys would fail, and as there is no other effective treatment available, patients would have no choice but to start a gruelling dialysis routine to stay alive,' a spokesman said. Research funded by the charity at Newcastle University has been central to understanding aHUS and to finding an effective treatment for the disease. Elaine Davies, from Kidney Research UK, said: 'We are thrilled with Nice's decision. 'Although there is a high cost attached to Eculizumab, this treatment is life-changing for aHUS patients and will help improve their quality of life dramatically. 'We're very proud that some of our research has played a role in understanding the disease.'","Around 200 patients suffering from atypical Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome .

"It has long been admired as the fastest animal. But it seems the cheetah’s lead over other species is not as wide as we thought. Research shows that the feline’s top speed is just 58mph, rather than the 70mph which was accepted for decades. The myth is dispelled in Sir David Attenborough’s new series of Natural Curiosities, in which he examines the most up-to-date findings. Scroll down for video . Cheat: The cheetah's top speed is only 58mph, research has found - though that's still pretty impressive . ‘For more than half a century we have overestimated the cheetah’s speed,’ the veteran presenter said. ‘The cheetah’s legendary top speed of 70mph is just a myth. But their true speed of 58mph is still extraordinary.’ He added that while the cheetah may not be as speedy as previously believed, it still holds its title as the world’s fastest land animal. ‘Its greatest feat is its acceleration,’ he said, ‘[Which is] four times that of sprinter Usain Bolt.’ Presenter: Sir David in TV show Natural Curiosities . The presenter – whose broadcasting career began when he joined the BBC in 1952 – shows just how comfortable he is with animals, filming one segment of the documentary next to an affectionate cheetah, which happily purrs and licks his knee. He explains the new and more accurate speed measurements were taken using high-tech data collection collars. The more accurate speed measurements were taken using high-tech collars, which used solar batteries and GPS to track the animals’ movements. Researchers collected data from 367 cheetah ‘hunts’ and the top speed reached during any of the chases was just 58 miles per hour. The research was developed by scientists at the Royal Veterinary College who honed the technique using greyhounds and lurchers. The dogs are ‘similar in size and shape to a cheetah’ so worked as a good substitution for the more unpredictable wild animals. Both have backs that flex and extend so greatly that at times none of their feet touch the ground. When researchers were sure the collar was not affecting the movement of the dogs, they tested the technology on wild cheetahs and found that previous estimations had been out by a whopping 12 miles per hour. The myth that cheetahs could reach 70mph began in 1957 after photographer Kurt Severin conducted a basic experiment using an upturned bicycle and some fishing line to pull along a meat-scented bag. He used a stopwatch and a pistol to record how long it took a cheetah to run 73-metre course. His results – showing cheetahs reaching speeds of 70 miles per hour - were soon accepted as scientific fact. The third series of Natural Curiosities starts at 9pm on February 2 on Watch.","Myth busted by researchers who attached GPS trackers to big cats .

"Unapologetic: Nicky Morgan, secretary of state for education, has shrugged off controversies over the inspection of Christian faith schools . Education Secretary Nicky Morgan last night shrugged off recent controversies over the inspections of Christian schools and launched a stalwart defence of her ‘British Values’ drive. In the wake of the row over some faith schools in the North East being labelled intolerant, she said she was ‘unapologetic’. Parents had complained that young children were being asked ‘inappropriate’ questions by Ofsted inspectors about gays, lesbians and Muslims. Just last week, the Mail reported how a ten-year-old girl came home from school crying after giving the ‘wrong’ answer to an inspector who asked her: ‘What is a lesbian?’ Ariella Wilkinson’s school, Grindon Hall Christian School in Sunderland, has now been put in special measures after the official Ofsted report found that discrimination ‘persisted’ there. Her mother, Lena, 46, said: ‘The questioning was completely inappropriate.’ However, Mrs Morgan said last night that she would ‘vigorously defend’ the British Values drive because it helped to ‘open young people’s minds’. She added: ‘I have no sympathy for those who say that British values don’t apply to them. Every school regardless of faith should be promoting British values.’ The Education Secretary, who has been nicknamed Ms U-turn for abandoning policies by her back-to-basics predecessor Michael Gove, condemned schools where girls might be made to sit apart from boys, or where ‘homophobia goes unchecked’, saying: ‘No school should be exempt from promoting fundamental values.’ The so-called British Values drive was launched last summer amid fears of an Islamist take-over of some state schools in Birmingham. But the new inspection regime has led to claims from other faith schools that they are being unfairly targeted. Mrs Morgan also attacked ‘old-fashioned nostalgia’ when it came to reforming the education system. In a speech to the political think tank Politeia, she revealed her plans for change were not about an ‘outdated world view’, but boosting social mobility. Mrs Morgan said: ‘The rationale that underpins our plan for education is simple – it isn’t about an outdated world view or old-fashioned nostalgia. 'It’s about a refusal to accept that educational attainment must be correlated to the wealth of your parents – that your future life chances are determined not by talent or effort, but by the circumstances of your birth. ‘None of us who believe in meritocracy, whatever side of the political spectrum, can be content with that.’ Congratulating her Government’s achievements over the last five years, she said the attainment gap was narrowing and one million more pupils were now studying in good or outstanding schools. And she described the rationale behind some of the Coalition’s policies, including curriculum, practical skills and ‘character education’. The latter means putting ‘character-building’ lessons on a par with traditional subjects. ‘No school should be exempt’: Grindon Hall Christian School in Sunderland has now been put in special measures after the official Ofsted report found that discrimination ‘persisted’ there . Mrs Morgan said: ‘Just as important to the next generation’s future as getting a sound academic grounding is ensuring they have the resilience and grit to deal with the challenges that life will throw at them. ‘To support schools, we’re investing in character education, supporting projects like the cadets, debating in schools and team-building activities, and providing support to help the best of these projects expand.’ This policy is in stark contrast to Mr Gove’s insistence that education policy should revolve around a thorough grounding in the essentials of maths, spelling, grammar and punctuation. Mrs Morgan, who replaced Mr Gove last summer, has been previously criticised for giving too much ground to teachers. As well as promising the unions she would do everything to reduce teachers’ workload, she scrapped Mr Gove’s introduction of snap Ofsted inspections. And she abandoned his plan to punish misbehaving children by sending them on a run.","Comes after Christian school put in special measures over sex ed quiz .

"Ben Burchfield (pictured) posted the advert offering to be a live-in maid seven days a week for just £100 . A keen young job seeker who has failed to find full time work despite sending off 50 job applications has offered himself up on eBay as a live-in maid-for a month in a bid to improve his CV. Ben Burchfield, 20, from Worthing, West Sussex, posted the unique advert offering to be a live-in maid for a month, working seven days a week for just £100, and says he is even happy to sleep in a shed. The determined jobseeker says he will 'do anything asked of him,' and can do everything from cooking bacon butties, cutting hair, cooking and cleaning to moving hazardous waste for his potential employers. He will carry out dusting, mopping, hoovering and 'bog cleaning' and even has his own hazmat protective suit and mask. Mr Burchfield's advert states: 'This ad is for a month period of my work services, but you have to include meals for myself and accommodation (a shed is good enough but anything more is appreciated) my working week is seven days so you get a full 28 days of my services.

In the advert he says he will do everything from dusting, mopping, gardening and hoovering to 'bog cleaning' 'I will do anything I can to improve my CV. I just want to make the most of what is out there. 'I left education with just GSCEs so I thought I should get experience in anything I can to prove myself. I suppose this is a last resort.' Mr Burchfield attended Durrington Primary and Secondary Schools, Worthing, where he gained eight GSCEs in science subjects, maths, art and design, English, information technology and business and communication. He went on to study Art and Design at Northbrook College before transferring course to study Motorsport Engineering. But Mr Burchfield left his course mid-way through and before starting a year-long job as a cleaner at Severn Water, completed a 12-week Princes Trust course in team work, community skills and employment skills and another in retail media. He said: 'Since leaving work at the end of 2013 I have had a few gardening jobs. 'I have probably sent off more than 50 job applications in varying fields and I have heard nothing back from any of them. Mr Burchfield (pictured) says he will even move anywhere in order to carry out the job - even Scotland . 'It's pretty disheartening. You send off all these applications and get nothing back.' In that time Mr Burchfield has also applied for five apprenticeships in the Worthing area in different fields ranging from aviation to security alarm services. He says his dream job would be to work in the aviation industry and he had applied for an apprenticeship with BAE Systems. He said: 'I got to the final round. I had to go to Doncaster for an aptitude test but lost out on the next round by three points. 'This was the only one I got an interview with. It has been really difficult to find jobs in the aviation industry let alonne just getting a regular job. 'I have had temp jobs at Tesco but have never been offered full-time employment.'

Mr Burchfield in his hazmat protective suit - he says he is willing to move hazardous materials for an employer . He said: 'I realised I had found all the jobs I had ever had on my own. 'Also I didn't want to claim benefits as I never really thought I needed them. 'I just thought someone else would need those benefits more than me. 'I wanted to try something different with the eBay advert and see if this would appeal to anyone. I will do anything, sleep anywhere - a shed so long as it isn't too leaky. 'I'll go anywhere - up to Scotland if that's where I am needed. 'It will be great to see the country.' In his advert Mr Burchfield says: 'I have previous experience in cleaning as I used to work for a cleaning company at southern water HQ, the tasks which included cleaning desks, dusting, moping, hoovering, toilet roll replenishment, bog cleaning, buffing floors, empty rubbish bins etc, can also clean carpets if you have the machine to do it.'

"A Utah animal sanctuary says a dog that escaped death in Indiana — a result of an ultimatum in the will of its late owner — has died. Best Friends Animal Society said Tuesday in a statement posted to its blog that it euthanized the dog named Bela after tests revealed fast-growing cancer in the dog's lungs. The sanctuary rescued the 105-pound German shepherd after owner Connie Ley of Aurora, Indiana, passed away in November. Her will dictated the dog be sent to Best Friends or be put to sleep, cremated and mixed in with her ashes. Ley worried the dog was too aggressive and might pose a danger to others. Brief reprieve: Bela the German shepherd died a little over a month after he was rescued after his Indiana owner died and willed he be euthanized and his ashes interred with hers . Best Friends says it will cremate Bela and send the ashes to Indiana to be interred with its late owner. One month after his owner died and willed him to be killed and buried with her, Bela the German shepherd had a new home where he could live out the rest of his life in peace. That life wound up being very short. Bela arrived at Best Friends Animal Sanctuary in southern Utah in December after staff from the shelter drove him more than 1,700 miles from Aurora, Indiana - outside Cincinnati, Ohio. Bela was rescued after animal lovers rallied to his defense and got a stay of execution for him early this month. When his owner, Connie Lay, died on November 25, she said that he should be either sent to the Best Friends shelter or put down, cremated and his ashes mixed with hers. Ms Lay's attorney, Doug Denmure, said Ms Lay didn't have enough money to send her pet to Utah - so the only option was to euthanize him. Sad: Bela arrived at Best Friends Animal Sanctuary in southern Utah in December after staff from the shelter drove him more than 1,700 miles from Aurora, Indiana - outside Cincinnati, Ohio. Over this past weekend, her was diagnosed with an aggressive lung cancer . The Best Friends family suffered a very sad and entirely unexpected loss over the weekend. On Sunday morning, we had to say goodbye to the magnificent German shepherd, Bela, who captured our hearts over the holidays. Bela was the object of international attention and affection in the weeks leading up to Christmas, when it came to light that the will of his recently deceased owner contained a discretionary clause that placed his life at risk. The will entrusted the late owner’s close friend to make the decision whether Bela should come to Best Friends Animal Sanctuary to live out his days or be killed and his ashes interred with his lifelong human friend. Following international coverage and arrangements with the deceased’s attorney and friend, Bela made a snowy cross-country car trip over Christmas with our trainer John Garcia. On Sunday morning Bela’s caregiver noticed that his abdomen was distended and he was breathing rapidly, so he was brought to the Best Friends clinic for an emergency checkup. Tests revealed fluid in his abdomen and also surrounding his heart. Most critically, X-rays revealed nodules in his lungs. Our medical director diagnosed Bela with a very fast-growing cancer and there was very little likelihood he would have lasted more than a very stressful day or so. Reluctantly, Bela’s caregiving team made the decision that euthanasia was the right option. This was a very difficult choice, as it is with any animal in our care, but we approached the decision from the perspective of what was the kindest course of action for Bela. It is our custom to bury Sanctuary animals who have crossed the Rainbow Bridge at Angels Rest, the permanent resting place located in Angel Canyon. However, in this case we felt the right thing to do was to fulfill Bela’s owner’s last wishes. Therefore, we are cremating Bela and sending his ashes to Indiana so he can be buried with his owner, who passed away in November. Bela was a great dog who made many friends and was quickly becoming one of the most popular dogs at the Sanctuary. Our staff had grown to love him as the sweet and wonderful dog he was, and every one of us who knew him is devastated by this turn of events. Bela will be greatly missed. Source: fox6now.com . News of Bela's fate was widely reported and sparked a #saveBela campaign on social media. Following outrage from the community, Best Friends stepped in and said the shelter would take Bela and have him transported to Utah. Mr Denmure now claims it was never his intention to have the dog put down. 'It was this lack of information and the unfounded social media backlash about Connie Ley, myself, and the provisions in her will about her pets, that caused the delay in resolving Bela’s future,' he said, according to a blog post from Best Friends. Bela was given a hero's welcome when he arrived to the Utah pet sanctuary but the happy new homecoming would soon turn tragic .","Connie Ley of Aurora, Indiana stipulated in her will that Bela either go to Best Friends Animal Sanctuary or die along with her .

"Newly released footage from a police body camera shows how a calm encounter between an Arizona officer and a domestic violence suspect quickly and unexpectedly turned deadly for the rookie cop last month. The nearly 14-minute video from Officer Tyler Stewart's department-issued recording device starts with Stewart in his patrol vehicle and ends with a gun pointed at him. The footage released Tuesday does not show the actual shooting. Stewart and Robert Smith chat calmly outside Smith's Flagstaff home December 27 for about three minutes. Smith had his hands in his pockets most of the time. Final moments: The nearly 14-minute video from Flagstaff Police Officer Tyler Stewart's body camera ends with a gun pointed at him . Riddled with bullets: Robert Smith, 28 (left), fired six shots at Stewart (right), five of which hit the 24-year-old officer: four in the head and one in the lower back . Killed over a trifle: Stewart, 24, was attending a domestic violence call sparked by an argument over dirty dishes . Moments after the officer asked if he could check Smith for weapons, Smith pulled a .22-caliber revolver from his right pocket and fired six shots at Stewart, five of which hit the 24-year-old officer: four in the head and one in the lower back. Police said Smith, 28, killed himself almost immediately with Stewart's service weapon and was pronounced dead at the scene. The officer who had been with the Flagstaff Police Department less than a year later died at a hospital. The video tracks what police have said all along about the shooting and highlights one of the most common calls for service in Flagstaff. The only thing off about Smith's behavior was that he kept his right hand deep in his pocket, police Sgt. Margaret Bentzen told the Arizona Daily Sun. Last ride: The video starts with Stewart in his patrol vehicle responding to a domestic violence call December 27 . Fateful encounter: This blurry image captures the moment Officer Stewart comes face to face with Robert Smith, who would kill him less than 15 minutes later . Deadly lie: The first thing that Stewart asks Smith after following him outside the house is if he has any weapons in his pocket, to which the suspect replies, 'No, sir. I'm just cold' The very first thing that Stewart asks Smith after following him outside the house is if he has any weapons in his pocket, to which the suspect replies, 'No, sir. I'm just cold.' The video shows that before parting ways, Officer Stewart again asks Smith about the contents of his pockets. The man replies that he's carrying his 'smokes' inside his jacket. But when Stewart tries to reach into Smith's pocket, the 28-year-old pulls out a gun and points it at the cop, who instinctively tries to shield himself with his hand. One of Smith's roommates told police that Smith had been contemplating suicide, according to police reports. Bentzen said police have not determined a motive. ‘Officer Stewart was murdered by Smith without any provocation or warning,’ she said. ‘There were no homicidal or suicidal indications from Smith prior to the crime.’ The video was released to the media under state public records requests. At around 1.30pm December 27, Officer Stewart pulled over in an alley near Clay Avenue after getting a call about a domestic incident. Robert Smith's girlfriend called 911 earlier that morning claiming that the 28-year-old trashed her apartment during an argument over dirty dishes, reported AZ Central. Stewart drove to the woman's home at around 11am, but Smith was already gone. The officer then went to Smith's home near Clay Avenue, but his roommate said the man had fled out the back door. Uncertain what to do, Stewart called his father, Sgt Frank Stewart, to ask him when he could enter a residence without a warrant. Cruel fate: Before parting ways, Officer Stewart again asks Smith about the contents of his pockets. The man replies that he's carrying his 'smokes' inside the jacket . Bloody end: Smith, 28, killed himself almost immediately with Stewart's service weapon (pictured) Records indicate that at 12.30pm, Smith called the Flagstaff Police Department and left a message for Officer Stewart. The rookie cop called the suspect back and less than hour later returned to his home, where he would be shot dead in cold blood. Other officers were called to the scene after Stewart flipped his emergency button. However, they could not get him on the radio. The officers found Stewart critically wounded. He was taken to Flagstaff Medical Center but later died. 'This is an enormous tragedy for our department and the family of our Officer,' local police chief Kevin Treadway told AZ Central last month. 'We are a very close knit organization, and know that all members of the Flagstaff Police Department are grieving at this time. Gone too soon: The 24-year-old was a graduate of Boulder Creek High School in Anthem, Arizona, and Concordia College in California . R.I.P.: Tyler Stewart is pictured here in a photo from his Facebook page . 'With that being said, all of the men and women of the Flagstaff Police Department extend our prayers and condolences to the family of our Officer Tyler Stewart.' Flagstaff mayor Jerry Nabours shared the sentiments, saying that it's 'heartbreaking to lose one of our officers. We collectively mourn for his family and the entire department'. Stewart was a graduate of Boulder Creek High School in Anthem, Arizona, and Concordia College in California. Because he had been officer less than 12 months, he was still considering a rookie.","Officer Tyler Stewart, 24, had worked as an officer in Flagstaff, Arizona, for less than a year .

"Life lost: Police in Denver shot and killed a 17-year-old girl identified by her friends as Jessica Hernandez early Monday morning . A deadly shooting of a 17-year-old girl at the hands of Denver police officers sparked angry protests in the city Tuesday, with members of the community demanding answers about the fatal encounter. Police shot the teenager early Monday morning after they say she struck and injured an officer with a stolen car. Authorities did not release the girl's name, but friends identified her as Jessica Hernandez. 'We're angry about it. It's another life taken by another cop,' said 19-year-old Cynthia Valdez, a close friend and schoolmate of the girl. 'She was trying to find her talent. She wanted to find out what she wanted to be. ... Who knows what she could have been?' Few details were immediately released after the shooting in an alley in the older, middle-class residential neighborhood. The four other people - three girls and a boy - in the car were not injured by the gunfire, and all were being questioned as part of the investigation, police said. It was not clear whether any had been arrested. Police Chief Robert White said an officer was called to check on a suspicious vehicle at around 6.30am Monday in the Park Hill section of Denver and a colleague arrived after it was determined the car had been reported stolen. In a statement, police said the two officers then 'approached the vehicle on foot when the driver drove the car into one of the officers.' White said both officers then opened fire. The officer hit by the car was taken to a hospital with a leg injury. Scroll down for video .

Bobbie Diaz, whose 17-year-old daughter was in the car, said she was lying in bed when she heard four gunshots followed by an officer yelling, 'Freeze! Get out of the car! Get down!' Diaz said she came outside to see officers with their guns drawn pulling people out of the car, including Jessica. 'She seemed like she was not responding, not moving,' she said. 'They just yanked her out and handcuffed her.' Meanwhile, Diaz said she heard another person screaming, 'She's dead! She's dead!' 'I'm just trying to process everything. I'm just heartbroken for the girl's family,' Diaz said. 'How could something like this happen again?' Another woman, Arellia Hammock, who has lived in the neighborhood for about a decade, said she heard three gunshots about 6.30am and then saw several police cars streaming down the street. Hammock said she understands one of the officers was injured, but 'that's still no reason to shoot.' 'They shouldn't have stolen a car. But the cops are too fast on the gun,' she said. 'You've got stun guns. You've got rubber bullets. Why do they have to shoot all the time?' That sentiment was echoed during Monday's vigil as some held signs decrying police brutality.

Makeshift memorial: A teddy bear sits near a display of candles standing near the spot where Hernandez was shot dead by police . Speaking out: Protesters wave placards as activists head into a meeting on Tuesday with officials from the office of the Denver District Attorney about the fatal shooting . One of the signs read, 'Girls' Lives Matter,' a play on the 'Black Lives Matter' slogan that became a rallying cry after the police killings of unarmed black men in Ferguson, Missouri and New York City. 'It should have been handled differently. She's a young girl. I'm just not OK with it,' said 17-year-old Destiny Moya, who grew up with Jessica. Both officers involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave pending the investigation, which was being conducted by police, the district attorney and the Office of the Independent Monitor, a civilian oversight agency for the city. Earlier today, prosecutors promised a thorough investigation and asked angry protesters gathered outside District Attorney Mitch Morrissey's office for patience. Morrissey wasn't there during the tense confrontation at his office, where chief deputy district attorneys Doug Jackson and Lamar Sims spoke over shouts and obscenities from some of the protesters. Jackson said he could not discuss the facts of the case but assured the group that the findings of the investigation will be made public when it's finished. 'You can decide whether we made the right decision or not,' Jackson said.

The girl's cousin, Jose Castaneda, said he was frustrated and didn't want to wait months to find out what happened. 'Let me ask you one question, how would you feel if it was your kid?' he yelled before storming away. Protesters said they don't trust Morrissey's office to handle the case because the last time a Denver police officer faced charges in a shooting was 1992. 'We are sick and tired of these kinds of things happening and there seems to be no true objective investigation,' said the Rev. Patrick Demmer of the Greater Metro Denver Ministerial Alliance. A shrine of red and white flowers and candles, and a grinning white teddy bear marked the shooting scene Tuesday. Magaly Castaneda, 17, a friend of Hernandez, visited the site and said she doubted Hernandez would have intentionally hit an officer. Those who knew Jessica (pictured left and right) said she had a lot of heart and expressed doubt that she had struck the officer on purpose with the car . 'She didn't even get time to think that she was going to get shot,' Castaneda said. She had known Hernandez since both were middle school students doing each other's hair and makeup. Castaneda said Hernandez would bring home friends who had nowhere else to go, sometimes exasperating her mother. 'She always had a heart. She always cared about everyone,' Castaneda said. By law, police are allowed to use force to stop and overcome the resistance of another person. They can use it to match the force and overcome it.","Police shot and killed girl identified by friends as Jessica Hernandez early Monday morning .

"Arrest: Verna McClain has been charged with capital murder in the killing of 28-year-old Kala Marie Golden, after she shot her and stole her baby . A mother was shot dead by a nurse who kidnapped her newborn baby. Kayla Golden, 28, was blasted seven times with a handgun when Verna McClain reportedly pulled up alongside her in a car. Despite her injuries she tried to stop McClain snatching three day-old Keegan but was knocked to the ground and later died. Police eventually traced McClain – who had reportedly targeted Miss Golden at random – to a home near Houston, Texas. Keegan was found safe and well. According to U.S. reports, McClain – a mother of three – had in recent weeks told her family she was adopting a child. After allegedly killing Miss Golden she told her sister Corina Jackson she now had a fourth child in her family. McClain is now facing a capital murder charge which means she could be given the death penalty if convicted. The horror began when Miss Golden took Keegan to her local paediatrician in Houston for a routine check-up on Tuesday afternoon. McClain and an unidentified male passenger are said to have pulled up alongside Miss Golden’s pick-up truck in their blue Lexus before she opened fire. Plan: McClain (pictured right with her sister Corina) had told her sister she was about to adopt a baby . Taken: Keegan Schchardt (left) was snatched after his mother Kayla Golden, 28, (right) was fatally shot . Witnesses described the sound as being like ‘pop pop pop’ and that even after being shot blood-stained Miss Golden managed to try to grab her baby back. Lieutenant Dan Norris of the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office said: ‘The child was being put into the suspect vehicle and that’s when the mother tried to get into the car. ‘The car sped away, knocking the lady to the ground.’ The Lexus was traced to McClain’s sister’s house in Houston and when a SWAT team burst in they found Keegan. From there investigators were able to find McClain herself in another home just outside the city. According to a police affidavit obtained by ABC News, McClain has admitted to the shooting and told her sister that she did it because she wanted to ‘adopt’ another child. Search: Officers enter an apartment where they found a woman speaking to the suspect on the phone . Closing in: Officers had tracked the blue Lexus used as a getaway car back to the apartment . Officers take cover behind a car at the apartment complex while SWAT team members broke down the door . She already has three children aged six, ten and 16. The killing comes only a day after Keegan’s father Keith Schuchardt posted pictures on his Facebook page announcing the baby’s birth. He wrote: ‘Baby keegan is here. born 4/14/12 6 lbs 15 oz, 20 inches long. Looks like me lol.’ According to U.S .reports he has not even signed the child’s birth certificate yet. Keegan is currently in the care of social services and his family are waiting for a full background check on them to be finished before they can have the child back. Support: The baby's father, Keith Schuchardt, is comforted by friends and family outside his home . Grief: Mr Schuchardt said how much he loved Golden and how they'd been excited about their future . The baby’s grandmother Linda Golden said she rushed to the scene but was not there in time to say goodbye to her daughter. She said: ‘I wanted to kiss her before they put her in the ambulance. She died trying to save her baby.’ Montgomery County District Attorney Brett Ligon said Miss Golden was in the wrong place at the wrong time and that McClain just wanted any child to add to  her family. He said: ‘There were statements as indicated in the arrest record that were made by Miss McClain that led us to believe that, in fact, this was an intentional act on her part. Caught: McClain (pictured right with her sister Yoki) has three children and is a registered nurse . Proud: Golden with Mr Schuchardt, who had announced the birth of their son on Facebook on Saturday . ‘Not that Miss Golden was targeted specifically, but that this was part of a plan to kidnap a child.’ McClain’s alleged male accomplice was also arrested but had not been charged last night.

"Apple reportedly paid as little as $83 million tax in Australia last year despite racking up more than $6 billion through sales of its products - a tax bill which works out to just 0.01 per cent of the massive revenue. In figures provided by the global giant's Australian arm to the nation's corporate watchdog, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, Apple shows its tax bill for the year ending September 27 has doubled from the previous 12 months. The revelations come as the Federal Government prepares to crack down on corporates' profits and prices. But Apple Australia, which has upwards of 3000 employees, told Daily Mail Australia only that 'we don't release details of what (tax) we pay but we are paying all taxes which are due' but would not be making any other comment on the controversy.

The revelations about Apple Australia's tax bill, come as the Federal Government prepares to crack down on corporates' profits and prices . However, DMA understands that the tech giant will defend itself against any suggestions it's minimising tax - by pointing to miscalculations by its critics of the Income Tax Expense included in its report to ASIC. That is a complex equation, which includes the amount of expense a business recognises in an accounting period for the government tax related to its taxable profit . It comes as the Australian Tax Office is reportedly set to undertake audits against local companies and major multinational corporations in an ongoing probe into profit shifting, a list which is believed to include up to 25 international technology groups. And according to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald, Apple is likely to be one of the organisations to be called before a Senate inquiry into corporate tax avoidance. Daily Mail Australia understands that the tech giant will defend itself against any suggestions it's minimising tax - by pointing to miscalculations by critics of the Income Tax Expense included in its report to ASIC . Apple Australia says 'we don't release details of what (tax) we pay but we are paying all taxes which are due' Meantime, Labor MP Ed Husic is a member of a parliamentary inquiry investigating alleged price gouging by tech companies, hit out at the results in an interview with the Australian Financial Review. 'It’s simply staggering to see Apple make more money but manage to pay less tax in Australia,' he said. 'When you consider the massive overcharging that has occurred with some of their products, it seems both Australian consumers and taxpayers are shouldering a heavy load to fund Apple’s bottom line.' Dr Antony Ting from the University of Sydney Business School says that 'roughly almost 40 per cent of what we pay for an Apple product in Australia is never taxed anywhere in the world' Dr Antony Ting is the University of Sydney Business School senior lecturer in Taxation Law. He explained the system Apple uses as part of its global tax structure, to minimise tax. 'Imagine if I pay $600 for an iPad in Australia, $550 is paid to Apple Ireland - that means very little profit is left to be taxed in Australia,' Dr Ting said . 'To make it worse, out of the $550 paid to Ireland, $220 is never taxed anywhere in the world. 'In other words, roughly almost 40 per cent of what we pay for an Apple product in Australia is never taxed anywhere in the world. 'One important point to note is that Apple's tax structure is perfectly legal. 'That means we need a serious re-think of the international tax rules for the taxation of company groups.' One Australian tax expert says 'imagine if I pay $600 for an iPad in Australia, $550 is paid to Apple Ireland - that means very little profit is left to be taxed in Australia' Apple Inc. has recorded staggering results, including revenue of US$74 billion in the last three months of 2014, selling about 34,000 iPhones every hour . Globally, Apple Inc. has recorded staggering results, including revenue of US$74 billion in the last three months of 2014 - generating profit of $18 billion on the back of the new iPhone's popularity. 'Demand for iPhone has been staggering, shattering out high expectations,' said Apple CEO Tim Cook. 'This volume is hard to comprehend. 'We sold about 34,000 iPhones every hour, 24/7 for the entire quarter. 'We have sold over a billion devices running iOS.' He also confirmed the firm's plan for Apple Watch were on track. 'Development for Apple watch is right on schedule, and we intend to begin shipping in April,' he said. 'We can't wait for customers to experience it. 'My expectations are very high, I use it every day, love it and can't live without it.'","Apple Australia reportedly paid $83 million in tax last year as its revenue comes in at a whopping $6 billion .
That is just 0.01 per cent tax on sales of popular products like the iPhone .

"A daring mother-of-two put herself up for sale on eBay in a quest to meet her dream Greek man - but quickly took it down after receiving bids from as far away as Australia. Lois Curtis, 49, from Haywards Heath, West Sussex, posted the unique advert on Sunday night in the hope a 'rugged, gorgeous, Greek guy' would snap her up. But the serial eBay user, who has always dreamed of moving to Greece, started getting cold feet after notching up a £205 bid in less than 24 hours. Scroll down for video . Lois Curtis, 49 (pictured) put herself up for sale on eBay in a bid to meet a 'rugged, gorgeous' Greek man . But the mother-of-two quickly took the post (pictured) when she notched up a £205 bid and attracted men from as far away as Australia . Ms Curtis decided to stop the bidding in its tracks - but is still being contacted by men from Puerto Rico and the U.S. She told MailOnline: ‘I want to go live and in Greece, it's always been a dream. So my friend Apostolos, who lives over there, said “Put yourself on eBay and I will share the link all over Greece”. 'He has loads of friends so we just thought we would see what happened and see whether anyone was interested, just for a bit of fun. ‘It was up for one whole evening and one morning too. In that time, I had one bid from Australia and one from Peurto Rico - I was amazed when it got to over £200. It was quite flattering. ‘But, no-one from Greece ended up contacting me - which was kind of the point.' The tongue-in-cheek advert, entitled 'female size 10', described Ms Curtis as being in 'pretty good condition' with 'good bodywork and a sense of fun'. The advert added: 'Cooks and cleans, no warranty... fuses have been known to blow'. Ms Curtis, from Haywards Heath, West Sussex, posted the advert on Sunday night but had taken it around 12 hours later . Despite removing the post, Ms Curtis is still being contacted by men over email, including from the U.S . She also posted accompanying photos, including images of her most recent visit to Athens. She added: 'It was really a bit tongue-in-cheek to see what would happen. Kind of like online dating I suppose - but I thought I might as well have a bit of fun with it. 'I was hoping for a nice Greek, rugged, gorgeous guy – the sort all women want. A few dates – that sort of thing. Of course, I was collection only and there were no refunds after purchase. ‘We were going to leave it and let the advert run, and just see who came forward. But I just changed my mind. ‘It got to the point where I thought “I have only got two bids” and I had agreed on 20 per cent charges. So I worried I was going to be charged more than I was worth!' In the tongue-in-cheek advert, entitled 'female size 10', Ms Curtis described how she was in 'pretty good condition' with 'good bodywork and a sense of fun' But the swift removal of the post has not stopped Ms Curtis being inundated with offers from men around the globe. She said: ‘Since I’ve taken it down, I’ve had about six or seven people email me, asking if they can still bid. I don’t even know how they managed to get in touch. One was from America and said he had his credit card number ready and could he make a bid. ‘There’s another guy that’s constantly emailing me – I don’t know where he’s even from. ‘I might do the advert again and this time ask specifically for someone from Greece – it’s tempting.’ Ms Curtis has wanted to move to Greece since she first visited the country five years ago. While travelling there on her own, she stayed in accommodation run by Captain's Studios & Apartments, where she befriended the owners. She and the family struck up an unlikely friendship and she now travels to their home near Kavos, Corfu, to visit them as often as she can. Ms Curtis has even started learning Greek, which she tries to practice when talking to the family over Skype. It was one of the sons in the family, Apostolos Krosis, who suggested she post the advert. She said: 'I’ve wanted to live over there for ages. It's just wonderful. They are like my second family, really. They are lovely people. But I haven’t gone yet because of the economy mainly.’","Lois Curtis from Haywards Heath hoped 'rugged' Greek would snap her up .

"Five teams competing for the $30 million Google Lunar XPrize have been awarded a total of $5.25 million for meeting key mission milestones. The groups are all hoping to develop a robot that can land safely on the moon, travel 1,640ft (500 metres) on its surface, and send two 'Mooncasts' back to the Earth. Among them is a small start-up from India, dubbed Team Indus, who has no experience in robotics, but has nevertheless managed to grab a $1 million of the prize. Scroll down for video . Five teams competing for the $30 million Google Lunar XPrize have been awarded a total of $5.25 million for meeting key mission milestones. Pictured is Astrobiotic's entry. It hopes to fund the development of its lunar landing by offering to take items to them moon - with prices ranging from $460 to $26,000 . Bangalore-based Team Indus has gone up against companies such as Moon Express which is billionaire-funded and has received a number of technologies from Nasa to get a head start. According to Dilip Chabria, co-founder: 'The Team Indus moon mission can cost us anywhere between $30 million and $40 million, depending on the cost of the launch vehicle.' And this is money that will have to be raised through sponsorships, prizes and crowdfunding – a daunting task. Hakuto is designing a 'Dual Rover' system, consisting of two-wheeled 'Tetris' and four-wheeled 'Moonraker' Astrobotic (Pittsburgh, US): Imaging ($250,000), Mobility ($500,000), Landing ($1 million) Hakuto (Japan): Mobility ($500,000) Moon Express (California, US): Imaging ($250,000), Landing ($1 million) Part-Time Scientists (Germany): Imaging ($250,000), Mobility ($500,000) Team Indus (India): Landing ($1 million) The other teams to gain a share of the prize included Astrobotic, Hakuto, Moon Express and Part-Time Scientists. Astrobiotic hopes to fund the development of its lunar landing by offering to take items to them moon - with prices ranging from $460 to $26,000. The firm, which has dubbed the service MoonMail, says it can even offer to give over entire missions for larger items that need more shipping space. They plan to launch on a SpaceX rocket. After achieving low Earth orbit, the Falcon 9 second stage re-ignites for trans-lunar injection (TLI) to propel Astrobotic's spacecraft into a 4.5-day cruise to the moon. Part-Time Scientists has designed a rover that relies on three imaging systems. The two outer cameras provide stereoscopic vision for navigation. The center one will provide the high-definition colour imagery . The Google Lunar Xprize  aims to do something we haven't done as humanity since 1973 - land on the surface of the moon. 'More than half of the world's population has never had the opportunity to view a live transmission from the lunar surface,' say the organisers. The prize aims to create a new 'Apollo' moment for this generation and to spur continuous lunar exploration with $40 million in incentive based prizes. In order to win this money, a private company must land safely on the surface of the Moon, travel 640ft (500 metres) on its surface, and send two signals back to the Earth. The system consists of two spacecraft, a lander and the Polaris rover; lander and rover exist as a single spacecraft until touchdown on the lunar surface. Hakuto, meanwhile, is designing a 'Dual Rover' system, consisting of two-wheeled 'Tetris' and four-wheeled 'Moonraker.' The two rovers are linked by a tether so that Tetris can be lowered into craters on the moon's surface. Part-Time Scientists from Germany has designed a rover that relies on three imaging systems. The two outer cameras provide stereoscopic vision for navigation. The center one, meanwhile, will provide the high-definition colour imagery. Finally, Moon Express has created the 'MX'-family of scalable landers which it claims are capable of reaching the lunar surface and other destinations from Earth orbit on direct or low-energy trajectories.

"Actress Maureen Lipman, pictured, said she was considering leaving the UK because of the rise in attacks on Jewish people . Maureen Lipman has said she is contemplating leaving the UK because of the ‘worrying’ rise of attacks on Jewish people. Mrs Lipman, 71, said the Jewish community in Britain ‘give, give and give’ and described the recent rise in anti-Semitic attacks as ‘very, very depressing’. The actress, best known for her 1980s adverts for BT, told LBC Radio: ‘When the economy dries up they turn on the usual suspect the Jew… and when the going gets tough the Jews get packing.’ When asked if she’d considered leaving the UK, Mrs Lipman replied: ‘Yes it’s crossed my mind that it’s time to look around for another place to live. ‘One school of thought says it’s because of Israeli policy in the Middle East, it isn’t. There’s been anti-Semitism for 4,000 years.’ Last year Mrs Lipman announced she was ending five decades of support for the Labour Party, as she furiously denounced Ed Miliband’s stance on Israel. Mrs Lipman said she would vote for ‘almost any other party’ until Labour is ‘once more led by mensches’ – the Yiddish word for a person of integrity. The actress added Mr Miliband’s support for a motion recognising the state of Palestine ‘sucks’ at a time of rising anti-Semitism in Europe. In her interview on LBC, Mrs Lipman continued: ‘I’ve thought about going to New York, I’ve thought about going to Israel. I’ve been talking about this for a long time’ Scroll down for video . ‘My kids are very bored with me…but it’s only in the last few months they’ve said “mum, we think you have a point”. ‘There are 245,000 Jews in the country. [W]hat’s to fear? We don’t fly planes into buildings, we generally keep on the right side of the law.’ Mrs Lipman’s comments add to the growing clamour of voices calling for protection of Jews and an end to anti-Semitic attacks . Yesterday, on Holocaust Memorial Day - which marked 70 years since the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp - film director Steven Spielberg told a group of Holocaust survivors that Jews are again facing the ‘perennial demons of intolerance’. He warned of ‘anti-Semites, radical extremists, and religious fanatics’ who are again provoking hate crimes — a warning that comes after radical Islamists massacred Jews at a kosher supermarket in the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris. Hollywood director Steven Spielberg, pictured, warned that Jews were facing the 'perennial demons of intolerance' during a visit to Auschwitz-Birkenau to mark the 70th anniversary of the camp's liberation . Spielberg also noted that there are now Facebook pages that identify Jews and their geographic locations with the intention to attack them, and a growing effort to banish Jews from Europe. ‘These people ... want to all over again strip you of your past, of your story and of your identity,’ he said. This week it was revealed that nearly half of Britons think at least one anti-Semitic view presented to them was ‘definitely or probably true’, the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism for YouGov poll found. One in eight said they thought Jews talked about the Holocaust to get sympathy, while one in four believed Jewish people ‘chase money more than others’. The Campaign Against Anti-Semitism (CAA) said the findings were a ‘shocking wake-up call’ and warned that anti-Semitism would grow unless it was met by ‘zero tolerance’. The group said the survey also revealed that people who said they would vote Ukip in the General Election ‘consistently believed more anti-Semitic statements to be true’, by an average margin of nine per cent.","Maureen Lipman said she is considering leaving the UK over anti-semitism .

The structure, comprising more than 25 layers of tyres and pallets, came tumbling to the ground under its own weight, according to website UTV. Sometimes stacked by their thousands, the tyres in such bonfires around the region cast a plume of fire - and thick, toxic smoke caused by the burning plastic - high into the night sky. It is illegal to burn the tyres, which emit toxic fumes - and bonfire committee workers had previously removed stacks in the area on safety grounds.

"The 500th birthday party is days away. For the first time in centuries, entire cows will be roasted once again over the roaring fire in this mighty Tudor kitchen. Plans are also under way to reopen Henry VIII’s famous wine fountain (with real wine). Hampton Court has been enjoying record visitor numbers of late, buoyed by its starring role as a 2012 Olympic venue. And those crowds are only likely to increase with the Tudors resurgent on our TV screens. Scroll down for video . Hampton Court Palace is just days away from celebrating its 500th birthday and enjoying record visitors . The BBC’s new codpiece-and-conspiracy drama Wolf Hall has already won rave reviews. Damian Lewis plays Henry VIII and Jonathan Pryce is Cardinal Wolsey, the scheming genius who started building work here at Hampton Court exactly five centuries ago in February 1515. So, ahead of the great quincentennial birthday celebrations, I have come to look round one of the greatest royal palaces ever created. And yet I find two sides to this endlessly fascinating 1,324-room colossus beside the Thames. Splendour: Robert Hardman samples the grandeur of historic Hampton Court Palace that is visited by 600,000 visitors each year . Because there is all the splendour of the tourist trail and state apartments, which draw 600,000 visitors each year. And then there are the dusty non-state apartments hidden from view and off-limits — for now at least. These are the remnants of Hampton Court’s more recent role as the home of ‘grace and favour’ free accommodation courtesy of the Monarch and paid for by the Crown. And while these rooms may not be as historically significant as, say, Henry VIII’s Great Hall, they tell an equally enthralling story. With their Seventies bathroom suites, moth-eaten curtains and Heath Robinson communications, they were, until quite recently, a very grand home for an intriguing mix of national heroes, well-connected widows, impoverished toffs and the odd downright scrounger. And the public footed the bill. Visitor numbers are set to be buoyed further by the new BBC 2 drama Wolf Hall, starring Damian Lewis as Henry VIII . Pushing open one creaking door, I come across riotous floral wallpaper and a lot of Formica. This flat was once home to a famously degenerate countess and, more recently, the mother of a minister in John Major’s government. Walking through another flat, recently vacated by the widow of a senior courtier, I find towels and sheets in the linen cupboard and a bedroom full of clutter. I also spot several copies of the Daily Mail from 1954 providing added insulation beneath the carpets. Robert Hardman goes behind the scenes at Hampton Court Palace to explore the once grace and favour apartments that are not open to the public. So what is the story of this faded, private world hidden inside a hugely popular public attraction? These apartments may not be remotely luxurious by modern standards but nor are they what most people would think of as ‘flats’. With an average of 12 rooms — plus servants’ quarters — they represent very substantial residences. And there were more than 50 of them still going strong during the 20th century. They housed an illustrious cross-section of tenants — ranging from the fugitive sister of the last tsar (who lived in the grounds of the palace) to the indefatigable widow of Lord Baden-Powell, founder of the scouting movement. Herself head of the Girl Guides, Lady Baden-Powell would often refer to Hampton Court as the ‘Hampers Hotel’. The rooms may not be as historically significant, but Robert Hardman found they still told a story. PIctured: Hardman in a seventies style bathroom . Most people associate Hampton Court with Tudor power. So many visitors are pleasantly surprised to find an entire baroque palace attached to the Tudor original by the Stuarts. As my guide, Dr Lucy Worsley, the TV historian and chief curator of Historic Royal Palaces, explains, the Stuarts regarded Hampton Court as Britain’s answer to Versailles. It wasn’t Henry VIII but Charles II who built the Venetian-style Long Water here. It was William and Mary who built the famous maze. Gathering dust: Until quite recently the apartments were a 'grand home' for a mix of an illustrious people . The palace remained an important seat of royal power until the death of George II. But ever since then, our monarchs have chosen to hold court elsewhere. With a large, empty palace at his disposal, George III decided to reward those who had performed a notable service to the Crown — or their widows — with rooms at Hampton Court ‘by grace and favour’. Would-be residents had to apply to the Lord Chamberlain. An early applicant was Dr Samuel Johnson, author of the first English dictionary, who wrote a fawning letter to the Lord Chamberlain in 1776. Dated: Robert Hardman is shown around the kitchen of one of the apartments by historian Dr Lucy Worsley . For all his brilliance, he was promptly rejected. The great landscape architect, Capability Brown, on the other hand, was granted handsome lodgings. So, too, was Michael Faraday, the father of electrical engineering. But despite their luck, some residents were always casting a jealous eye over their neighbours’ apartments. Charles Dickens described them as ‘civilised gypsies’ with ‘a dissatisfied air about themselves’. The Lord Chamberlain was bombarded with complaints. One Victorian spinster complained ‘common decency’ was ‘impossible’ because her two lavatories were less than 4ft feet from her drawing room. But when informed that they would have to pay for their keep, most grumblers desisted. There was much Lady Grantham-style moaning, in 1838, when Queen Victoria announced that the state apartments would henceforth be open to the general public. Behind the scenes: The apartments, with an average of 12 rooms, are not open to the public at the moment. They housed a cross section of illustrious tenants. Pictured: Robert Hardman in a seventies style bathroom . Similar outrage followed a ban on dogs, although the Lord Chamberlain grudgingly allowed ‘lap dogs’ (one of which turned out to be a Labrador). Perhaps the most remarkable resident was Miss Millicent Gordon, daughter of a poor but well-connected Army officer. Several copies of the Daily Mail were found to be offering insulation beneath the carpets of one of the apartments . She was born at Hampton Court and lived here for more than a century — through the Crimean, Zulu and Boer Wars and on through both world wars, too. In 1942, the 97-year-old spinster asked the authorities if she might finally be equipped with a bathroom. It was installed at last in 1949 — shortly after her death at the age of 104. It was during World War II that George VI granted Rosalind Kennedy an apartment following the death of her husband, a gallant Royal Navy officer, on active service. A faded sign still still on display in the stairwell of Hampton Court Palace warning residents to switch the lights off . Her son, the broadcaster Ludovic Kennedy, came to live in his mother’s quarters for a short period, too. He later described the King’s gesture to Rosalind as ‘more tangible and lasting’ than a posthumous VC. Though the system continued in to the current reign, its days were numbered. Few post-war residents were able to employ permanent staff and some were living at the top of several flights of stairs. Dr Worsley and Robert Hardman explore the roof of Hampton Court Palace and enjoy the Capability Brown landscaping . Many kept a basket on a pulley system and would hoist daily deliveries up the stairwell. In 1986, a tragic spotlight fell on this dwindling band of residents when fire broke out in a flat occupied by the elderly widow of WW1 and WW2 veteran General Sir Richard Gale. The blaze killed Lady Gale and did much damage to the palace. Three years later, Hampton Court left state control to become part of Historic Royal Palaces, the independent charity which also runs the Tower of London (without subsidy). Today, the only surviving ‘grace and favour’ residents are two elderly widows of former royal officials and a handful resident staff — including the Keeper of the Great Vine (the gardener who tends the oldest grape vine in the world). The Palace has a total of 1,324 rooms, but many of them are not open to the public. Pictured: Robert Hardman and Dr Worsley on the roof of the historic royal palace . As Dr Worsley takes me round, it’s clear that Hampton Court is still very much a work in progress. For now, the priority is vital repairs to Anne Boleyn’s Gateway. Opening up the ‘grace and favour’ labyrinth can wait. Some former apartments have become offices and storage space. Others have been handed to the Royal College of Needlework. One of the biggest, the Cumberland Suite, has just become a splendid new art gallery. Many of the residents of Hampton Court Palace would keep a basket on a pulley system to hoist up their daily deliveries . But other flats have hardly changed since the last grace-and-favour residents moved out. We walk through Apartment 4, once home to the notoriously unfaithful Countess of Berkeley, of whom the 18th-century politician Horace Walpole wrote: ‘There is nothing so black of which she is not capable.’ The last resident was the Countess of Caithness, mother of Malcolm Caithness, who was a minister for John Major. She moved out in 1977, leaving behind a time capsule of the period — bright-pink flowery wallpaper, a rickety gas hob and an avocado bathroom suite. Robert Hardman found that very little has changed since the majority of the grace and favour residents have moved out . The basket, with which she would hoist her morning milk and newspaper up 86 stairs, still dangles from her third floor landing. A more recent departure was Lady Manning, the popular widow of a former governor of Jamaica, who lived here from 1935 to 1992. But although she had 40 rooms, her apartment had no heating. Walking through her flat today, it is absolutely perishing. Hampton Court Palace is no part of the Historic Royal Palaces, the independent charity which also runs the Tower of London . Dr Worsley would like to open up this apartment to the public as a classic example of the grace and favour system but, for now, funds and staff are required elsewhere. ‘ . ‘And, of course, if we did open up all these old apartments, the public wouldn’t have enough time to see them all. There are just too many.’ Besides, she has another pet project: ‘If it’s the last thing I do, I am determined to get a Venetian gondola back on the Long Water!’ Life has certainly been strange but never dull round here. Happy 500th, Hampton Court.

"Defence officials have secretly started examining plans to move Britain’s nuclear-armed submarines from Scotland to Wales, the Daily Mail can reveal. The Scottish Nationalists, on course for an unprecedented breakthrough at May’s General Election, insist they want the Trident fleet removed from its base on the west coast of Scotland. David Cameron refused to allow any contingency planning for Scottish independence to take place before last September’s referendum, not wanting to give the impression that the UK Government was even contemplating defeat. Scroll down for video . As polls revealed the SNP may have the power of king-maker after the general election, Parliament has begun drawing up plans to move the nuclear deterrent to Wales (pictured, HMS Vanguard at the Faslane base) But now, despite the ‘no’ vote in the referendum, pollsters say the SNP is on course to win dozens of Commons seats and may hold the balance of power at Westminster after the Election. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s new First Minister, has made scrapping Trident a condition of entering any sort of power-sharing deal with Labour. The Ministry of Defence insists it has no intention of moving the nuclear deterrent from the Faslane naval base on the River Clyde and is committed to maintaining a continuous, submarine-based missile system to protect the UK. But sources have disclosed that work has now begun on the practicalities of shifting Britain’s nuclear defence systems to Pembrokeshire, should that prove necessary. Labour’s First Minister in Wales, Carwyn Jones, is understood to have indicated he would be prepared to see Trident relocated to Milford Haven, a natural deep water port. Britain has four Royal Navy Vanguard submarines, based at Faslane, which can deploy Trident ballistic missiles carrying nuclear warheads. One well-placed source said political leaders in Wales were keen for the Ministry of Defence to ‘look at Welsh sites – not just Milford Haven’. Nicola Sturgeon (right) said scrapping trident would be a condition of a power-sharing deal with Labour, while Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones is understood to have volunteered Milford Haven as a replacement . The source said it would be negligent not to prepare for all contingencies, given the SNP surge in Scotland and the possibility of the party holding the balance of power. Mr Cameron said this week that the prospect of a Labour government being ‘held hostage’ by Scotland’s former First Minister Alex Salmond, who is running for a Westminster seat, was ‘genuinely frightening’. Ed Miliband has been forced to restate his commitment to replacing Britain’s nuclear weapons, after failing to vote against an SNP Commons motion calling for Trident to be scrapped last week. The Labour leader’s spokesman said: ‘Our position on Trident is clear and unchanged. 'Labour believes Britain should be leading international efforts for multilateral nuclear disarmament while maintaining a minimum, credible independent nuclear deterrent.’ However, one pro-nuclear Labour MP accused Mr Miliband of ‘trying to be cute’, adding: ‘He wants to carve a different position to that of the Tories but it’s a dangerous game.’ The SNP yesterday welcomed a YouGov poll showing that, when ‘don’t knows’ are removed, 53 per cent of people in Scotland agree that the UK should give up nuclear weapons. Across the UK, however, only 25 per cent of voters want Britain to give up Trident when it reaches the end of its useful life in 13 years. British fighter planes could return to Afghanistan to tackle the Taliban months after the last troops were withdrawn. Defence chiefs are examining plans to send a squadron of Tornados to bomb militants following a series of major Taliban attacks. A senior Whitehall source said: ‘We are looking at sending Tornados back.’ But resuming combat operations would be seen as an admission that Britain quit too soon after 13 years of fighting. Tornados could return to Afghanistan in the wake of several Taliban attacks, but resuming strikes would be seen as an admission that Britain quit too soon after 13 years in the country . As British soldiers pulled out late last year, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said they would not go back ‘under any circumstances’. But despite his confidence, 2014 was the deadliest year of the conflict, with the Afghans losing more than 4,500 men – more than Nato forces lost in 13 years. However, the country is still said to be three years away from having an air force. An MoD spokesman said: ‘We do not expect to send fighter jets to Afghanistan. There is nothing in train on this.’","Nicola Sturgeon said scrapping trident is key to any Labour election deal .

"Over the course of his 60 year career in television, David Attenborough has encountered some of nature’s most incredible and intriguing animals. But the veteran broadcaster has revealed that his absolute favourite of all the planet’s creatures is a nine-month old human baby. ‘The one creature that really makes my jaw sag, that I find absolutely fascinating so much that I can hardly stop looking at it is a nine month old human baby,’ said 88-year-old Sir David. Scroll down for video . Veteran broadcaster Sir David Attenborough, 88, has revealed that his absolute favourite of all the planet’s creatures is a nine-month-old human baby. The wildlife expert said he finds them 'absolutely fascinating' ‘The rate at which that grows. The rate at which that learns. The rate at which it acquires words. I mean, human babies are the most extraordinary of all creatures. They are the most complex. To me, nothing compares to it.’ He also confirmed that, of all the places he has visited on earth, his favourite is not the fascinating Galapagos islands or the plains of Africa, but the south west London district of Richmond-upon-Thames. ‘That is true,’ he said. ‘Actually, when it comes to it, what makes a place is the people who live there and my family have lived there for a very long time.’ Sir David has two children, Robert and Susan, and several grandchildren who are now adults. He has previously spoken about his concerns that his grandchildren may never see polar bears in the wild. Speaking at the launch of the new series of his documentary Natural Curiosities which begins on Watch February 2nd, Sir David was also quick to answer when asked about his least favourite animal. ‘Rats, rats, rats,’ he replied, without a moment of hesitation, before telling an audience at the London Zoo about several unfortunate experiences he has had with the rodents. ‘I’ve had rats crawling over my face at night,’ he said. ‘And I don’t want to put you off your meals, but I was in India recently and I’m not usually afflicted, but I did have a case of, you know. 'I had to run for a loo and I sat on the loo and I did what I had to do, and then this rat came out from between my thighs. That is not endearing.’ He admitted that he often gives a range of answers when asked about his favourite animals, depending on what he has been thinking about recently. Another animal to make it onto his list of favourites is the weedy seadragon, a relation of the seahorse which can camouflage itself against the seabed. He said: ‘If you’ve never seen the courtship dance of the weedy seadragon then life has still got great treats in store for you. Sir David also expressed his love for the Octopus. ‘They are the most extraordinarily intelligent animals,’ he said. ‘And ravens. I had a friend who had a raven and I watched it being given a bottle with a piece of meat in it. And straightaway it dipped it in a pond and shook the food out. It took all of 30 seconds. ‘I said to its owner, “you must have trained it to do that” but he said that it had learned to do it on its own in about two minutes.’ Father of two Sir David, who is brother to the late director Richard Attenborough, said that his interest in animals was recently echoed by a seven-year-old girl who had written to him about one of his programmes. ‘I had a sweet letter from a girl who said she liked the programme. She ended the letter by saying “I like animals because they are very different” and I thought, yeah, she’s hit it on the head. That’s exactly why I like animals, because they are different.’","David Attenborough says his favourite creature is a nine-month-old baby .

"As the world pays tribute to the six million Jews murdered during the Holocaust, Prime Minister David Cameron has urged Britain to stand together to stamp out prejudice and anti-Semitism. While survivors of the Auschwitz Nazi death camp marked the 70th anniversary of its liberation in Poland, political leaders, the Prince of Wales, prominent Jews and cast of stars of stage and screen gathered in London amid tight security. Mr Cameron told those in attendance that modern Britain must 'not allow any excuses for anti-Semitism' as he unveiled plans for a national memorial to the victims of the Holocaust. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron urged Britain to 'not allow any excuses for anti-Semitism' at tonight's Holocaust Memorial Day event . Mr Cameron chats to Holocaust survivors at an event in London which took on extra poignancy given it marked the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi death camp Auschwitz . Mr Cameron announced Government plans for a new £50million Holocaust memorial in central London. Here he is pictured speaking to survivors . It comes less than three weeks after four were killed in a terror attack on a kosher supermarket in Paris, an event which has dominated the tributes for those commemorating the murder of six million Jews during the Second World War. Mr Cameron told the sombre gathering at Methodist Central Hall: 'We stand in remembrance of those who were murdered in the darkest hour of human history. We stand in admiration of what our Holocaust survivors have given to our country. 'It is time for Britain as a nation to stand together and say 'We will remember',' Mr Cameron, said, marking the annual Holocaust Memorial Day. 'To say ""We will not allow any excuses for anti-semitism in our country"". We will not let any form of prejudice destroy the multi-faith, multi-ethnic democracy we are so proud to call our home. 'We will teach every generation the British values of respect and tolerance that we hold dear. And we will ensure that they can learn from the stories of our Holocaust survivors long after we have all gone.' It was announced the Government is to put £50million towards the construction of the 'striking and prominent' monument in central London, as well as the establishment alongside it of a 'world class' education and learning centre. They were among recommendations of a commission set up by the Prime Minister to ensure lessons continue to be learnt even after all eye-witnesses have died and which found 'worrying gaps' in young people's understanding of the Holocaust. Scotland Yard assistant commissioner Mark Rowley has warned there is a 'heightened concern' about the risk to the Jewish population in Britain since the French slaughter at the hands of an accomplice of the Charlie Hebdo killers. Arts Council England chair Sir Peter Bazalgette will head a new United Kingdom Holocaust Memorial Foundation, Mr Cameron said - with some of the money used as an endowment to ensure education work can continue. Prince Charles also spoke at the event, where he described the Holocaust as not just a 'Jewish tragedy' but a warning and lesson to all of us . Prince Charles shakes hands with Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis at the Methodist Central Hall in London . Holocaust survivor Ann Kirk and the Prince of Wales share a laugh as they shake hands . The Duchess of Cornwall chats to survivors of the Holocaust, after dozens of influential actors read poetry and accounts of those killed . 'Today we stand together - whatever our faith, whatever our creed, whatever our politics,' Mr Cameron said after he, Labour leader Ed Miliband and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg all met with Holocaust survivors. 'We stand in remembrance of those who were murdered in the darkest hour of human history. We stand in admiration of what our Holocaust survivors have given to our country. 'And we stand united in our resolve to fight prejudice and discrimination in all its forms. We will keep Britain's promise to remember today, tomorrow and for every generation to come.' Prince Charles, who with the Duchess of Cornwall also mingled with dozens of survivors, described the Holocaust as not just a 'Jewish tragedy' but a 'warning and a lesson to all of us, of all faiths and in all times'. He said the memory of the 'Nazis' diabolical enterprise' was relevant to today's conflicts and should help people reflect on how to respond to events in the Middle East. Actors Sir John Hurt, Michael Palin, Keeley Hawes, Sarah Lancashire and Christopher Eccleston were among those taking to the stage to give voice to the accounts of victims and survivors and to read poems. Pictured from left is Mr Cameron, a Holocaust survivor, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Labour leader Ed MIliband . Actor John Hurt and presenter Natasha Kaplinsky were two celebrities who gave voice to survivors' accounts and readings at the event . A harrowing video also served to remind that 2015 also marks 20 years since more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered at Srebrenica, the worst atrocity in Europe since the Second World War. Six candles designed by sculptor Sir Anish Kapoor were lit by five Holocaust survivors and a survivor from the Bosnian war, who were handed tapers to do so by Charles and Camilla. Possible sites for the memorial and learning centre include a new wing of the Imperial War Museum, at Potters Field near London Bridge, or at the Millbank complex alongside the Tate Britain museum. The Commission said that it should represent 'at its heart' the experience of the six million Jewish victims of the Holocaust, but should also honour the memory of other victims, including members of the Roma community, Jehovah's Witnesses, political dissidents, homosexuals and people with mental and physical disabilities. Backing the national memorial plans, Labour leader Mr Miliband - whose family lost several members in the Holocaust - said: 'At a time of rising anti-Semitic attacks in Britain and across Europe, it is imperative that we remember what religious prejudice can lead to. 'I know that the Holocaust Commission recommendations will be instrumental in educating our future generations and in recording and preserving the stories of our Holocaust survivors and those who fought to liberate them.' Labour leader Ed Miliband chats to a Holocaust survivor at a reception at the Methodist Central Hall, London . Pictured left and right, actress Helena Bonham Carter stretches to take a picture of Prime Minister David Cameron . Mr Clegg spoke out in support of the inclusion of gay victims of the Holocaust. 'The symbol of the pink triangle, once intended as a badge of shame, today stands as an international symbol of freedom and pride. From the dark shadow of history rises a neon emblem of diversity and hope,' he said. 'Any memorial remembering the Holocaust should recognise the persecution of non-Jewish victims whilst maintaining the centrality of the six million murdered Jews.' Chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust Karen Pollock said: 'As we mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War and liberation of the concentration camps, we are at a crucial juncture. 'The announcement of a new national Holocaust memorial with a world class learning centre with a renewed focus on education will place the UK among the world's leaders in ensuring that future generations always remember this tragic episode in our shared history.'","British Prime Minister David Cameron unveils plans for the creation of new Holocaust memorial in central London .

"Former television presenter John Leslie has laid bare his torment at the devastating sex attack claims that destroyed his career and nearly brought him to suicide. The former host of This Morning says being named supposedly accidentally as the alleged rapist of fellow TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson ruined his life, leaving him broke and turning him into a hermit. He has not worked in television since the unfounded 2003 allegations and says he still feels damned for crimes he didn't commit. Branded a monster: John Leslie says the false sex claims that destroyed his career left him on the brink of suicide . Mr Leslie's life went on a downward spiral from the moment he was named on a TV show as being the mystery man Ulrika Jonsson said sexually assaulted her in her book. The rumours were completely unfounded . The ex-Blue Peter star, 47, told the Sunday People: 'Every day you leave the house you are reminded of it. I was never able to move on, it was like an illness that couldn't be cured. I was labelled a monster. I once contemplated suicide because I couldn't see a way out.' His career was effectively over from the moment he was named, apparently accidentally, on daytime television as the man who launched a sex attack on Ms Jonsson, who has never revealed the identity of the mystery criminal she wrote about in her book. He was dropped from This Morning and then more allegations came to light in 2003, concerning two alleged indecent assaults on a 23-year-old actress in 1997. He was subsequently cleared 'without a stain on his character'. Mr Leslie, who has a six-year-old daughter by former girlfriend Rachel Bentley, was then dogged by by a sex tape that emerged of him with another former girlfriend, actress Abi Titmuss, 36, and another woman, before another unfounded rape accusation was leveled at him in 2008. Old flame: Mr Leslie with Catherine Zeta-Jones . Ex: With Abi Titmuss, who stood by him during trial . Mother: Rachel Benchley with whom he had a daughter . After years of rejection in his bid to relaunch a TV career, he tried his hand at becoming a property developer but his attempt coincided with the housing crash, leaving him with no money. There was another knock-back in 2010 . when ITV bosses approached Mr Leslie to appear on I'm a Celebrity Get Me . Out Of Here before backing out over his troubled past. He says, in retrospect, he is glad didn't take . part as it reinforced there would not be a second chance for him and . stopped him becoming a television 'circus act'. Despite being out of the public eye, he says people still recognise him - but for the wrong reasons. 'Before it was like, ""he's the guy on the telly"" and after it felt like they were saying, ""he's the guy that's been accused of hurting women"".' Mr Leslie pictured outside a police station in 2003 where he addressed the media over further unfounded sex allegations on a woman in 1997 . With little cash, Mr Leslie relied on royalties from his time as host of game show Wheel of Fortune to make end meet. He admitted he made mistakes and didn't know how to handle his private life, saying he was 'loud and boisterous' and 'tactile with boys and girls but you can't do that', while he says was unable to separate his onscreen personality from his every day life. Currently single, Mr Leslie said a previous three-year relationship with a psychologist helped him deal with his problems. Mr Leslie, who also dated Hollywood star Catherine Zeta-Jones, 43, says he remains close to Miss Titmuss, who stood by him during the court trial into the assault allegations. He is now a radio DJ on Edinburgh station Castle FM, with a show every Friday. Things are looking up: Mr Leslie says he is rebuilding his life as a radio presenter after a hellish 10 years of dealing with false sex claims . Despite being back on track, Mr Leslie says he still has worries, including how to break the news of his troubled past to his daughter. And he remains bitter about how he was treated, comparing his ordeal to Lord McAlpine, the Tory peer wrongly accused of child sex abuse by Newsnight, who received £185,000 in libel damages from the BBC. Mr Leslie says he received nothing. He also believes rape laws should be changed so the accused isn't named until they are convicted. Mr Leslie believes his new career has been a 'breath of fresh air' and believes being out of the public spotlight is the right thing to do by his parents Lex and Les, both 72. 'They suffered a lot more than me and still suffer from the legacy,' he said. 'For years mum would be in floods of tears when people said negative things about me, it was tough seeing them upset.' 'Sometimes I feel this is the path that was set put for me so maybe this is meant to be. 'I just hope my life is about to change for the better.'","Ex-TV star, now 47, says ordeal left him broke and a hermit .

"After taking a long, hard look at some of America's biggest cities, Kink University has determined Portland, Oregon is the nation's kinkiest town. The Pacific Northwest city topped the list for having the largest population of kink-identified people with 3.99 per cent considered to be among the adventurously amorous. Kink University used four criteria: 'the total size of the kink-identified population, the size of the population relative to the city's size, the number of resources available for kink-identified people, and the adult entertainment purchases in each city.' Kink University used a variety of criteria to find the kinkiest cities around America based on factors including kink-identified population and the number of resources available for such people . Coming in a close second was San Francisco, wrote the Huffington Post. 'San Francisco is usually seen as the center of kink life in the United States, but rising housing costs resulting from the tech boom seem to have pushed the community northward,' according to King University spokesperson Mike Stabile. Rounding out the top ten from most to least kinky are New York City, Chicago, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, Seattle, Boston, Philadelphia, and Los Vegas.

"The four surviving medieval copies of Magna Carta will be brought together for the first time in history in 2015. The date is 800 years after the issue of the Charter by King John in 1215. The unification will be held at the British Library for three days in early 2015 and will kick off a year of celebrations across the UK and the world. The four surviving medieval copies of Magna Carta will be brought together for the first time in history in 2015. The date is 800 years after the issue of the Charter by King John in 1215. Pictured is the copy from Sailsbury Cathedral . The event is taking place in collaboration with Lincoln Cathedral and Salisbury Cathedral, where two original copies of Magna Carta are usually kept. The other two copies are housed safely at the British Library. It will provide a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for researchers and the public to see all four documents side-by-side. History buffs will be able to enter a ballot to win one of 1,215 free tickets to see the unified Medieval manuscripts. The papers will be examined in the British Library’s Conservation Centre by some of the world’s leading experts on the documents. Experts are currently undertaking a major research project on Magna Carta and the charters of King John, funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. The unification will be held at the British Library for three days in early 2015 and will kick off a year of celebrations across the UK and the world. Pictured is one of two copies kept at the British Library . This unique opportunity will allow the historians involved to study faded or obscured parts of the text more closely and to look for new clues about the identity of the writers of the texts, which is currently unknown. Magna Carta, meaning ‘The Great Charter’, was issued by King John of England as a practical solution to the political crisis he faced in 1215. Written in Latin on parchment, Magna Carta established for the first time that the king was subject to the law, rather than above it. Although nearly a third of the text was dropped or substantially rewritten within ten years and almost all the clauses have been repealed in modern times. However, Magna Carta remains a cornerstone of the British Constitution and its principles are echoed in the US constitution and others around the world. There are four remaining copies of the Magna Carta. Two are kept at the British Library, one at Sailsbury Cathedral (pictured left) and another copy (pictured right) at Lincoln Cathedral . It has been used in many ways since . the Middle Ages but it has become a potent, international rallying cry . against the arbitrary use of power. The British Library is staging an exhibition about the medieval charter. Lincoln Cathedral is opening a Magna Carta centre in Lincoln Castle, while Sailsbury Cathedral will host educational and outreach events to celebrate the 800 year anniversary. Claire Breay, Lead Curator of Medieval and Earlier Manuscripts at the British Library, says: 'Magna Carta is the most popular item in the Library’s Treasures gallery, and is venerated around the world as marking the starting point for government under the law. 'Bringing the four surviving manuscripts together for the first time will create a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for researchers and members of the public to see them in one place.' The Dean of Salisbury, the Very Reverend June Osborne, said: 'Magna Carta’s clauses on social justice are as relevant today as they were 800 years ago and are at the heart of all we aspire to. History buffs will be able to enter a ballot to win one of 1,215 free tickets to see the unified Medieval manuscripts. The papers will be examined in the British Library's Conservation Centre (pictured) by some of the world's leading experts on the documents . 'We hope the publicity generated through the planned unification and 800th anniversary year will increase awareness of its importance, values, ideals and modern significance to a huge new audience.' Richard Godden, a partner at Linklaters, a law firm that is supporting the reunification, said: 'Magna Carter is a foundation stone of the Rule of Law and its influence extends around the world. 'The arbitrary authority of the state is just as much a threat today as it was in the day of King John and the principles enshrined in Magna Carta remain essential not only in relation to personal liberty but to creating an environment in which business can prosper. We forget them at our peril.'","800-year-old documents will be displayed at British Library in 2015 .

"Controversial: Michelle Beer (pictured), who appeared on television show Too Fat To Work . Family doctors could be offered bonuses for weighing thousands of patients under NHS proposals to tackle obesity. They would be given financial incentives for recording the weight of anyone with an underlying health problem triggered by being overweight. Based on existing incentives, the payments could range from £1,500 to £15,000 a year per GP surgery depending on how effective they are deemed at helping the NHS. The plans have been drawn up by health watchdog NICE in the hope of ultimately saving the NHS billions of pounds by treating complications caused by obesity. The news of the proposals comes amid increasing controversy over the cost of obesity to the state. This month Channel 5 documentary, Benefits: Too Fat To Work featured couple Michelle and Stephen Beer, who say their weight prevents them from working. Between them they weigh 54 stone and receive around £1,700 a month in benefits. A quarter of adults in Britain are considered obese and our rates are the second highest in Europe, only surpassed by Hungary. Although there are no accurate estimates of the cost of obesity to the NHS, it spends £10billion annually treating Type 2 diabetes alone. But senior doctors said the proposals were just a ‘box-ticking’ exercise which would just overburden GPs with more paperwork without actually benefiting patients. In October last year, similar plans to pay GPs a £55 bonus for each dementia diagnosis in a bid to boost detection were condemned as an ‘ethical travesty’. The obesity payments would form part of a bonus scheme called the Quality and Outcomes Framework, or QOF, whereby extra cash is given to surgeries for treating illnesses such as heart disease and depression. GPs would be urged to record the body mass index (BMI) once a year of anyone with high blood pressure, asthma, heart disease, arthritis or who has previously had a stroke or heart attack, which are commonly triggered by obesity. The BMI is the measurement of a person’s weight in relation to their height and a reading of 25 or above is considered overweight while 30 or higher is obese. NICE stressed that the proposals are still in the very early stages and would now be considered as part of a month-long consultation, along with incentives for other conditions. If approved, they would be passed on to officials at NHS England who would negotiate with senior doctors at the British Medical Association on how much the incentives should be worth and what targets should be met to earn them. But based on existing incentives, they could range from £1,500 a year up to £15,000 a year depending on how effective they are deemed to be at tackling obesity. Doctors across the UK could be offered financial incentives - ranging from £1,500 to £15,000 a year - for recording the weight of anyone with an underlying health problem triggered by being overweight (file picture) The payments would then be offered from next year – although they would go to surgeries, rather than to GPs directly. A spokesman for British Medical Association said: ‘We would need to see the details of the proposals and ensure that they have real clinical value, rather than being a box ticking exercise that place yet another pointless administrative burden on overstretched GP services.’ But GP David Haslam, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said the plans didn’t go far enough, as GPs should be focusing on weighing patients who don’t yet have a health problem – so it could be prevented. He said: ‘It’s all in the wrong direction. It’s people without a diagnosis for one of these conditions who need to be screened.’ The QOF consists of targets covering a range of conditions including heart disease, dementia and cancer. A maximum of 1,000 points is available for every practice per year, and each point is worth £157. But experts have warned it has offered limited benefit to patients as it encourages doctors to focus on conditions which merit payments.","Doctors could be offered bonuses for weighing patients under NHS plans .

"A shocking video has emerged which appears to show a pro-Russian rebel commander force-feeding captured Ukrainian soldiers their own uniforms. It shows four frightened men in military fatigues kneeling while another man known simply as 'Givi' stands over them. The aggressor who is thought to be a separatist fighter from the 'Somalia' group pulls out a large, shining knife and cuts the badges from their uniforms. He then aggressively thrusts it down their throats and demands they begin chewing. The terrified men comply immediately. Force-fed: The man identified as 'Givi' thrusts a piece of one man's uniform down his throat . Agressor: The alleged pro-Russian rebel cuts the badges off the men's uniform with a large knife . Threatening: He then forces the men to open their mouths and demands they chew the insignia . Terrified: The four men, believed to be captured Ukrainian fighters, are seen kneeling in terror . Intimidation: The alleged pro-Russian commander asks them: 'Why have you come here? Who called you to kill our people and destroy our homes?' The alleged rebel fighter says: 'Why have you come here? Who called you to kill our people and destroy our homes? 'Do you know me? I'm Givi! I grew up here, this is my land, but I will come to you, so that you too know what this is, that this is hell.' The video suggests the Ukrainian soldiers had been captured in Donetsk International Airport. Separatists claimed today they had pushed government troops out of two districts outside their main stronghold of Donetsk. The pro-Russian rebels' advance, launched last week, has reignited fierce fighting which has already claimed the lives of over 5,000 people in Ukraine. Separatists are now intent on pushing Ukrainian artillery back until it is out of range of their cities, in a bid to strengthen their bases. Eduard Basurin, the rebels' deputy commander in Donetsk, said fighters had pushed government troops out of the suburb of Maryinka and the town of Pesky near Donetsk's airport. He said: 'They had fully controlled Maryinka before. Now it is neutral. They are only on the outskirts.' Destruction: Workers try to repair the city of Mariupol where rebel shelling killed at least 30 people . Missile assault: The bombing of Mariupol (pictured) is the latest attack since fighting sparked up again in Ukraine . Death: The 30 people buried in Mariupol (pictured) are among the 5,100 killed in the Ukrainian conflict . Retaliation: The recent shelling has forced Ukrainian troops (pictured) to position themselves in Mariupol . Their ultimate goal is to eventually capture the entire Donetsk region, Basurin said. Meanwhile, shelling has continued all along the front-line which weaves through Donetsk and neighbouring Luhansk provinces. Vladimir Saakyan, a 60-year-old pensioner who fled his home in northern Donetsk, said: 'They've been shooting heavily for ten days. You sit there and have no idea who is in control of the town, who is shooting and when it will end.' The United Sates and Europe have called for tighter sanctions against Moscow in light of the new rebel advance. Ukraine's politicians and NATO claim Moscow has sent thousands of troops to fight on behalf of the rebels. Now, US President Barack Obama has said Washington will consider all steps 'short of military action' to isolate Russia. Accusations: Ukraine's politicians and NATO claim Russia has sent thousands of troops to fight on behalf of the rebels (Russian President Vladimir Putin pictured) Unicef claims over 1,000 children have been forced to seek refuge in underground bomb shelters in Donetsk due to ongoing violence in eastern Ukraine. It says thousands of people in embattled areas have little access to food, water or proper hygeine. Giovanna Barberis, Unicef's Representative in Ukraine, said: 'Children in the affected areas have been suffering enormous levels of stress due to the ongoing conflict. 'The most vulnerable are those who have been forced to seek refuge in unsanitary, crowded and freezing cellars and bomb shelters, children living on the streets, and those who come from poor families or whose homes have been severely damaged.' While the size and conditions of shelters vary, 1,000 children are estimated to be regularly seeking refuge inside them during heavy shelling in Donetsk city alone. Since March 2014, more than 1.5 million people have been displaced from the conflict-affected areas, including 1 million people within Ukraine. Of these, more than 130,000 are children.","The video appears to show four terrified Ukrainian soldiers on their knees .

"A US stand-up comedian and star of multi award-winning television US show Breaking Bad has been taken to task by an Indigenous rights campaigner after controversial comments he made on his podcast. Bill Burr is known for his outrageous comedy routine and role as lawyer Saul Goodman’s henchman Patrick Kuby in Breaking Bad. The 46-year-old is currently doing a stand-up tour of Australia and arrived in Perth at the start of his tour on Australia Day. To give American listeners some context on his podcast he referenced the Midnight Oil song Beds Are Burning. He quipped that rather than give the land back to the Indigenous people as the song argues, it’d be better to ‘just give them casinos like we did (in the US), and get on with your lives’. Scroll down for video . Bill Burr starred in hit TV show Breaking Bad as Saul Goodman's henchman Patrick Kuby . Mr Burr was referring here to various Native American tribes who took unprecedented action in the 1970s to initiate Native gaming enterprises, and many proved to be very lucrative. The comedian was poking fun at the Midnight Oil song and Australia’s history on its national day, but Michael Mansell of the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre wasn’t laughing. Mr Mansell, who has said financial compensation should be included as part of the government’s apology to the stolen generations, reacted angrily to the comic’s comments. ‘This bloke is saying that if Indigenous people get their land back they won’t make any economic benefit out of it,’ Mr Mansell said. ‘It’s like if we did get the land back we’d just sit on it and do nothing. It is just plain racist and not funny at all.’ The Midnight Oil song Beds Are Burning was referenced by Mr Burr as he riffed about Australia on his podcast . Mr Burr does a popular weekly podcast and on Monday admitted that he didn’t know what Australia Day was or anything about Australia. ‘I know that they have a very similar history to the US in that, you know, they had some Englishmen come over here. And there was people already over here, so that was a problem,’ he said on his podcast . ‘They dealt with it in a way that centuries later musicians with guilt would write songs about.’ The American stand-up comedian joked that Australia had the same kind of history as the US as 'they had some Englishmen come over here' He then broke into singing lines of the song Beds Are Burning by Midnight Oil, like ‘out where the river broke’ and ‘the time has come’. Mr Burr then referred to the band’s lead singer Peter Garrett, who went on to be a Cabinet Minister for Labor under Kevin Rudd and then Julia Gillard. ‘Remember that guy? He said (in the song): ‘The time has come. To say fair’s fair. To pay the rent. To pay our share’,' Mr Burr explained. ‘Then at the end he’d go: ‘Let’s give it back!’ But give what back? The f***ing land? And displace nine million people? ‘It’s over. It’s a terrible thing that happened. Just give them casinos like we did (in the US), and get on with your lives.’ Mr Burr always maintains that anything he says should not be taken seriously . Burr’s comedy has always been confrontational and he admitted on his podcast that he should not be taken seriously. ‘I’m not judging you guys. We got the same history and worse in the US,’ he said. However, Mr Mansell still believed that more respect should have been shown to Australia’s chequered past. Michael Mansell of the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre is not a fan of Mr Burr's humour however . ‘It’s still pretty offensive. The hypocrisy of people like this who say that that Aborigines or any Indigenous people keep looking backwards are the same people who celebrate an event like Australia Day that happened 220 years ago, which celebrates the arrival of white people,’ Mr Mansell said. ‘It’s hypocritical of him. If atrocities are committed against a whole people and a whole country was taken and over 200 years later these people still feel the consequences of that; why should we forget?’ Mr Burr is currently touring Australia and arrived in the country on Monday which was Australia Day .","Mr Burr is doing a stand-up tour of Australia, and arrived in Perth on Australia Day .

"She's  one of British's most cherished stars of screen and stage and has kept fans entertained for nearly 60 years. But, as her latest interview proves, Dame Judi Dench still looks - and feels - young at heart. Gracing the cover of Good Housekeeping magazine in a stylish powder blue coat, the 80-year-old discusses red carpet fashion, whether she’ll ever remarry and how she feels the temptation to get a tattoo. Scroll down for video . Dame Judi Dench, 80, is Good Housekeeping magazine's March 2015 covergirl and chats tattoos, feeling edgy about retiring and whether she will ever remarry . Dame Dench made her professional acting debut in 1957 with the Old Vic Company. Fast forward nearly 60 years and she has added ten BAFTAs, six Olivier Awards, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, two Golden Globes, an Academy Award, and a Tony Award to her awards cabinet. She's also become a poster girl for the mature female actress and her red carpet choices are respected worldwide (even if she admits she 'loathes' getting ready and is always 'terribly nervous' in clothes 'you have to live up to'). Despite her success and worldwide acclaim, you'd be wrong for thinking that the grand dame of acting, whose roles have included A Room with a View, Shakespeare in Love and Chocolat, will consider retiring anytime soon though. In the interview, she discusses cosmetic work and while she admits she'd love to go into surgery right now and come back with completely smooth skin, she's far too squeamish . In October, she began filming as Cecily, Duchess of York to Benedict Cumberbatch's Richard III in the second series of The Hollow Crown. 'The thought of putting my feet up doesn’t appeal at all – no no, no!,' she said. 'I’ve got plenty of time for that at weekends or on odd days off. The prospect of no work on the horizon makes me a bit edgy. I have no particular ambitions – I just want to be employed!' Feisty and independent as ever, Dame Judi recently insisted she is driven mad by people constantly asking if she's ready to slow down - and turning 80 in December was no different. 'All I wanted was the people I love around me, I didn’t want a fuss. The words old, eight-oh and retire are banned in my house,' she said of the milestone celebration. The fun-loving Bond actress admits that she was even tempted to get a tattoo to mark her 80th birthday . Keen to prove her point, the fun-loving Bond actress admits that she was even tempted to get an inking to mark the occasion. She said: 'I am tempted to have a tattoo to mark my birthday. Finty’s [her daughter] very keen on me having one. There’s an Indian symbol that I like which supposedly represents life and love and everything. 'One of the cameramen who worked on The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel told me what it meant, but I’m a bit nervous in case I’m being set up… It might be unbelievably rude!' As well as tattoos, she also discusses cosmetic work and while she admits she'd love to go into surgery right now and come back with completely smooth skin, she's far too squeamish. She said: 'I don’t think I’m vain enough. It’s not that I don’t mind the lines, because I do, but just not enough to do anything. My agent would go barmy. I’d do myself out of the parts for old people.' Dame Judi may have become a poster girl for the mature female actress but she admits she 'loathes' getting ready for the red carpet .

Judi, who was heartbroken after losing partner Michael Williams to cancer in 2001 following 30 years of marriage, also speaks candidly about finding love again with conservationist David Mills. She said: 'For 30 years, I was divinely happy with Michael. I love the company of being in a relationship - I’m no good on my own. 'It’s lovely to have someone to laugh with again: David has a heavenly sense of humour. 'He laughs at exactly the same things as I do. 'Humour is the most important thing. If someone can make you laugh, even in the middle of the most terrible time, it’s wonderful.' Discussing the prospect of remarrying, she added: 'Marriage isn’t something I’ve thought about. 'David has his house, I have mine a few miles away, and that suits us. 'He’s from a different world from me and it makes for a great balance. I’m jolly lucky.'

"Poet and naturalist Helen Macdonald’s ‘haunting’ book H Is For Hawk has won the Costa Book of the Year Award – the first biography to win in ten years . It describes with ‘searing honesty’ her painful struggle to come to terms with her father’s death, helped by a rather unusual companion – a hawk. Now poet and naturalist Helen Macdonald’s ‘haunting’ book H Is For Hawk has won the Costa Book of the Year Award – the first biography to win in ten years. Literary judges last night praised the part-memoir, part-nature work as ‘a unique and beautiful book with a searing emotional honesty’. It details Miss Macdonald’s journey training a baby goshawk in her small Cambridge home after the sudden loss of her photojournalist father Alisdair Macdonald. Miss Macdonald, 44, had experience of breeding and training hawks but warned in a recent interview: ‘I don’t recommend that people go and train goshawks as a way of managing grief. It’s a really terrible idea. ‘There are very few times in life when you do things that just seem necessary, even though you know to an outsider they’re a bit bewildering. 'But it was a compulsion. An extraordinary compulsion.’ Miss Macdonald, who is unmarried and has no children, added: ‘I trained the hawk because I didn’t want to be me any more. ‘I wanted to stop being a human because humans feel deep grief and emotions, and I wanted to fly away from that and become something else.’ It took the judges just an hour and a half to decide the winner of the £30,000 prize, which is one of the UK’s oldest literary awards. Chairman of the judging panel Robert Harris, himself a best-selling author, described the book as a ‘sort of modern classic’. Mr Harris also last night criticised the BBC for not running programmes dedicated to books. H Is For Hawk, Miss Macdonad’s third book, also won the Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction last year. Last night Miss Macdonald, who no longer owns a goshawk but has a parrot, said: ‘It was never expected and I’m really thrilled. ‘I wanted to tell a story unflinchingly about what it is like to be very, very sad and very much miss someone that you love... It was cathartic, but I didn’t expect it to be.’ It took the judges just an hour and a half to decide the winner of the £30,000 prize, which is one of the UK’s oldest literary awards. H Is For Hawk, Miss Macdonad’s third book, also won a Samuel Johnson Prize in 2013 . Miss MacDonald's award-winning H Is For Hawk . In the part-memoir, part-nature book, Miss Macdonald describes how she was knocked sideways by the death of her father in 2007. Grief-stricken, she feels compelled to train a goshawk and, after stuffing her freezer full of hawk food, drives up to Scotland and pays a breeder £800 for Mabel, her new companion. She then begins training her in her small Cambridge home. Miss Macdonald, who had trained birds of prey before, writes: ‘I didn’t feel I had any choice. I started dreaming about goshawks and I knew I really wanted to train them and fly them. 'It was the only certain thing in my life.’ She realised her solitary life with Mabel might make an interesting book but could not write it for nearly seven years. ‘It needed that distance,’ she said. ‘When I started it, I wasn’t so confessional but it didn’t work. 'I realised I had to be truthful about what happened.’ The book has been praised for its searing honesty about her grief.","Helen Macdonald’s ‘haunting’ book  has won Costa Book of the Year Award .

"Allegations: Lord Mandelson received the cash from a firm to funnel income from speaking engagements . Peter Mandelson has been accused of slashing his tax bill by giving himself a £400,000 loan. The Labour grandee received the cash from a company he set up to funnel income from his book and public speaking engagements. Instead of withdrawing the money in salary or dividend payments, which would have to be taxed, the former business secretary chose to receive it as a loan from the company of which he is the sole shareholder. According to accounts filed at Companies House, Lord Mandelson’s firm, Willbury Limited, gave him a £400,000 loan in the 2013/14 financial year. Provided that a minimum rate of interest specified by HM Revenue & Customs is charged, the borrowing is not liable to be taxed. At the time of the loan, the official interest rate was 3.25 per cent. Director’s loans can be used legally to delay the payment of tax on income – potentially indefinitely. The accounts for Lord Mandelson’s company, which was set up two weeks after the 2010 general election, show it charged £15,211 in interest on the balance. But no repayments were made, nor was any repayment schedule or loan term set out. Scroll down for video . Richard Murphy, a chartered accountant and director of Tax Research UK, said that it was likely the loan was being used as a way of avoiding tax. ‘How to extract cash from small companies whilst paying as little tax as possible on the way is a massive part of the UK tax avoidance industry,’ he told The Guardian. Income: The Labour grandee at a signing for his book The Third Man, about his life at the heart of New Labour . ‘Directors taking loans from companies they own is one way in which this is done, which has been widely condemned in the past when done by footballers and others. ‘It’s just about impossible to think this is motivated by anything but tax avoidance. 'All politicians, including members of the House of Lords, should not only be seen to comply with the spirit of the law on tax but should be required to do so as a condition of holding office.’ A spokesman for Lord Mandelson said: ‘[Willbury Limited] oversees all of Lord Mandelson’s writing, public speaking, broadcasting and personal commercial undertakings. ‘It pays all relevant UK corporate taxes and Lord Mandelson pays all relevant personal taxes.’","Money was earned through book sales and public speaking engagements .

"Russian spies operating a cell in New York were trying to find ways to cause an economic meltdown, according to court documents. The three men allegedly wanted to ‘destabilise’ high frequency trading systems, which were blamed for the Wall St ‘Flash Crash’ of 2010. The men also moaned to each other that being a modern day spy was nothing like James Bond films, and that they longed for a more glamorous lifestyle, the criminal complaint reveals. Three Russian men accused of being spies in New York planned to sabotage high-frequency messages by Wall Street traders to cause a financial meltdown, similar to the 'flash crash' in 2010 . The FBI began investigating the men in 2010 after ten Russian spies living in the US were arrested, including red-haired femme fatale Anna Chapman. Last night the exposure of the latest spy ring threatened to turn into a diplomatic row as Russia said there was no evidence against the trio. Prosecutors in New York named the spies as Igor Sporyshev, 40, who was working as a trade representative, and Victor Podobnyy, 27, who was an attache to the Russian mission at the UN. They were the handlers of Evgeny Buryakov, 39, a banker at Vnesheconombank, a former Soviet bank owned by the Russian state with an office in Manhattan. By the time the cell was cracked by the FBI on Monday, Sporyshev and Podobnyy had left America. However Buryakov was arrested and appeared before a federal judge where prosecutors said: ‘His life here is a deception.’ During the Flash Crash the Dow Jones lost 1,000 points within minutes only to bounce back right away, sparking fears that automated or ‘robot’ trading could be vulnerable to hackers or terrorists. All three men are accused of trying to gather information on such high frequency trading and Exchange Traded Funds (ETTs), or bundles of shares, by recruiting women who worked in finance and others linked to a major university in the city. They also tried to get information on US sanctions against Russia and alternative energy sources being developed in America. In a conversation secretly taped by the FBI in May 2013, Sporyshev asked Buryakov about what questions he can give to other agents working for an unnamed Russian media organisation for intelligence-gathering. Buryakov replied that they can ask about ETT and ‘how they are used, the mechanisms of use for destabilisation of the markets’. The men were also secretly recorded talking about how they wished their lives were more like James Bond . He says: ‘Then you ask them what they think about limiting the use of trading robots... and about the potential interest of the participants of the exchange to the products tied to the Russian Federation.’ According to the criminal complaint, the three spies spoke to each other in code to set up their meetings and claimed they had an umbrella or a ticket for the others. In person Buryakov would pass Sporyshev a bag, a magazine or a piece of paper with information hidden inside it. They met in the open air so ‘the risk of effective surveillance was reduced relative to an indoor location’. In a separate conversation, in April 2013, Podobnyy fantasised about being James Bond, saying: ‘The fact that I’m sitting with a cookie right now at the chief enemy spot. 'F***! Not one point what I thought then...not even close. (unintelligible) movies about James Bond. ‘Of course, I wouldn’t fly helicopters. But, pretend to be someone else at a minimum.’ Sporyshev replied: ‘I also thought that at least I would go abroad with a different passport.’ Buryakov was denied bail because he was a flight risk. He is accused of acting as an undeclared foreign spy among other offences and faces 15 years in jail if convicted. Sporyshev and Podobnyy are charged with aiding him in his activities.","Men planned to interrupt signals causing meltdown like 2010 'flash crash'

"Some older women with breast cancer could safely avoid radiotherapy without harming their chances of survival, say researchers. Older patients who are given breast-conserving surgery and hormone therapy gain very ‘modest’ benefit from radiation treatment, they found. The findings suggest that carefully selected patients who are at low risk of recurrence could avoid the health risks and side effects associated with radiotherapy, such as fatigue and heart damage. Some older women with breast cancer could safely avoid radiotherapy without harming their chances of survival, say researchers . Currently older women with early-stage hormone-sensitive breast cancer are offered surgery to remove their tumour, followed by hormone treatment and radiotherapy. Conventional external beam radiotherapy, which irradiates the whole breast, involves many hospital visits, often spread over several weeks to reduce side effects, such as tissue shrinkage. Few trials have assessed the benefits of radiotherapy in older women treated using breast-conserving surgery, where the lump is removed not the whole breast. Scientists at the University of Edinburgh led an international trial involving 1,326 patients aged 65 or older with early-stage hormone-sensitive cancer, the most common form of breast cancer. Their tumours were surgically removed and had not spread to the lymph nodes underneath the arm, says a report in the journal Lancet Oncology. Half of the women were given radiation as well as hormone treatment and half were given hormone treatment alone. After five years, roughly 96 per cent of both groups had survived, and most deaths were not caused by breast cancer. Katherine Woods, of the charity Breast Cancer Campaign, said: ‘These results are very interesting' Around 1.3 per cent of those given radiation had cancer recur in the treated breast compared with 4.1 per cent of those who did not receive radiotherapy. Pregnant women are more than twice as likely to quit smoking if they are offered shopping vouchers as part of a treatment plan, according to a study. Researchers from Glasgow and Stirling universities divided 612 pregnant smokers into two groups. Half were offered only advice and nicotine replacement therapy to help them stop smoking. Half were offered up to £400 worth of vouchers to be used at stores including Argos, Boots and Toys R Us if they had the advice and treatment and quit while pregnant. According to a report in the BMJ, 69 women quit from the group offered shopping vouchers, and 26 from the other group – 23 per cent and 9 per cent respectively. The results were confirmed by urine and saliva testing. After 12 months, 15 per cent of women who were offered financial incentives remained off cigarettes compared with4 per cent in the other group. The report says that widening the incentive scheme could produce public health benefits ‘as important as vaccines’. But critics are likely to claim ‘bribery’ is being used to get mothers to maximise the health of their children. In the UK around 5,000 babies a year die in the womb or shortly after birth from mothers smoking in pregnancy. Professor Ian Kunkler, of the University of Edinburgh’s Cancer Research Centre, said: ‘While radiotherapy will remain the standard of care for most women after breast-conserving surgery, the absolute reduction in risk of recurrence from radiotherapy in low-risk older women receiving hormone treatment is very modest. This makes omission of radiotherapy an option for selected older patients.’ In the UK, around 50,000 women develop breast cancer each year – four out of five in the postmenopausal years after the age of 50 – and almost 12,000 women die each year. Radiotherapy is offered to all women who have breast conserving surgery – around 35,000 a year. The Edinburgh researchers stressed that the results were only applicable to patients aged 65 or older with grade 1 and 2, node-negative tumours up to 3cm in size. Dr Emma Pennery, clinical director at the charity Breast Cancer Care, said: ‘We know that some older women find the prospect of radiotherapy such a burden that they opt to have a mastectomy to avoid it, so this research will be hugely welcomed by many patients. ‘Radiotherapy can cause side effects such as pain and fatigue, which can be very daunting. ‘However, this study is on a group of patients with a particular kind of breast cancer. Findings also show rates of local recurrence were nearly 3 per cent higher in women who didn’t have radiotherapy treatment. ‘Radiotherapy is still a highly effective treatment for many women with breast cancer.’ Katherine Woods, of the charity Breast Cancer Campaign, said: ‘These results are very interesting. However, with only five years’ follow up the results do need to be approached cautiously.’","Older breast cancer patients could avoid radiotherapy, study finds .

"Within seconds, my eyelashes freeze. Shortly followed by the hairs inside my nose. It's minus 30C; a punishing cold - and tonight I'll be sleeping in a room made entirely of ice. I'm not allowed to take any personal belongings with me because they'll freeze. The Ice hotel, in Jukkasjärvi in Swedish Lapland, 120 miles into the arctic circle, celebrates its 25th birthday this year. Its presence is cyclical: every March, huge blocks of ice are harvested from the town's lifeblood, the River Torne; stored in a freezing warehouse over summer and carved, mounted up and smoothed into 55 ethereal rooms, an ice bar and a chapel. Come April, the sun is strong, everything melts and the river rolls on again. Scroll down for video . The spectacular Ice Hotel, in Jukkasjärvi in Swedish Lapland, 120 miles into the arctic circle, celebrates its 25th birthday this year . Reindeer selfie, complete with frozen eyelashes; preparing for a night at -5C; and the morning after, complete with authentic bed hair . As I flounder into an arctic sleeping bag wearing the advised long johns, hat, gloves and woolen socks, I fear this will be a long night. I start to regret the generous helping of wine I had 'to warm me up' – no one needs an emergency midnight loo visit at -5C. I may be lying on several reindeer hides, but the ice bed, walls, floor, ceiling and sculptures aren't exactly lulling me to sleep. It really is cold. Cold, but the peace is immediate, I can hear my own breath. The hotel is open to guests from December to April, and sees as many as 50,000 visitors in a season. Main hall, pictured here . Aurora Borealis through the skies above the Ice Hotel; where sightings of the impressive ionisation of atmospheric particles are common . 'Don't underestimate how cold it can be. Dressing correctly in the Arctic environment, where temperatures can easily dip below -30°C, enables visitors to enjoy the pristine wilderness without exposing themselves to very real danger,' says Simply Sweden's Chris Graham. 'We offer the following advice to all customers who book a winter holiday to this region and most of our holidays include a loan of high grade warm outer clothing for activities.' 'Layer up. The first should by thin, made from synthetic fabric or wool (not cotton) and designed to wick moisture away from the body. There are some excellent technical fabrics on the market. Next, a thick middle layer, or several thin layers (make sure they fit over each other, allowing free movement) – base layers, fleeces or wool jumpers work well. Bring thermal leggings, too. 'Although we arrange for loans of clothing such as wool fleece bottoms and snowmobile suits, it's a good idea to bring a large down wind and waterproof jacket and protective trousers. If you get hot, you can always take a layer off. 'Watch the extremities. Wear thin liner gloves, then a pair of mittens, which keep hands warmer than finger gloves. Liner socks (silk are good), then one or two pairs of wool, not cotton, socks will keep feet warm and dry, as will a pair of specialist boots (try them on with all your socks). Again, guests are provided with appropriate boots, thick leather mittens and protective deerstalker hats for outdoor activities. 'Don't wash or shave just before going out into the cold – the natural oils in the skin protect against the extreme elements. And don't use water-based cosmetics or soaps because they will freeze.' Extreme weather: Temperatures in Northern Sweden can drop down to as low as minus 40 degrees in the winter months . On checking in, guests are armed with an enormous padded boiler suit, snow boots, fleece and leather mittens and a balaclava. Over the four days of my stay, temperatures drop to -37C, so despite looking like a cross between Robocop and a yeti, these warm items become my allies. It's not all freezing though. The hotel has two warm receptions and a warm restaurant dishing out reindeer meat and hot chocolate, as well as plenty of warm suites and chalets. Also, once you've been outside, the interior seems quite toasty. 'Snice' the combination of snow and ice used to build the hotel, is insulating, keeping the temperature at -5C. Cold rooms come in tiers: from bread and butter ice bed and four walls to super deluxe suites complete with a warm section with a sauna and toilet built in. But the art suites are king. Each year, the hotel pumps around £900,000 into gathering ideas from graphic designers, wood sculptors, street artists, architects –even musicians (over 50 per cent have never worked with ice before). A jury decides the best 15 and the artist then travels to Lapland to construct their design. 'We're not looking for another swan or dolphin, we want original ideas,' says Jens, one of the hotel's top designers. 'We don't want the rooms to look like ice cream and slush.' My room, Ways of Vision, designed by Swedish sculptors Lena Kristrom and Nina Hedman, entitled Rays of Vision. Inspired by the corbels of Uppsala Cathedral, statues on pillars surrounding the bed, symbolise the different ways of seeing which exist in our world. 61 cold rooms at the Ice Hotel . 72 warm rooms at the Ice hotel . 50,000 annual visitors to the Ice Hotel . 80 weddings take place each year at The Ice Hotel . 900  tonnes of ice used in its construction .

Its three-night Traditional Icehotel break costs from £995 per person, including b&b accommodation (one night in a cold room, two nights in a warm room), flights, transfers and a guided tour of Icehotel. Activities cost extra, but often include lunch or dinner and start at £124 per person for a four-hour Northern Lights Snowmobile Excursion with evening meal. For more information on Swedish Lapland, visit www.swedishlapland.co.uk . There's an art to dressing for cold weather, especially sleeping in it. The idea is to layer, but only using the correct fabrics, if you get too warm, you'll sweat, and when the moisture freezes, so will you. Several fellow visitors don't appear to have received the memo; I see one motley lot wondering around in onesies, a woman carrying an aeroplane travel pillow and one lunatic even wearing flip flops. The cold weather clearly gets to people. 'Children often try and lick the ice,' says Paula, the guide. 'Last year a 24-year-old student try to kiss the ice and staff had to unstick him using hot water and chisels'. I'm told another member of staff walked in on a couple making the most of the double sleeping bag, too. But mostly, people just don't wear the right clothes and suffer as a consequence. I sleep surprisingly well. It takes a while to shift the 'I'm cold' voice in my head, and I manage to lose a crucial glove and my hat during the night, but I wake up feeling remarkably refreshed. I thought I'd feel shattered in the morning, but I feel cleansed; lighter; like I've spent the night inhaling the purest Swedish air. There's something quite magical about sleeping in ice. At the Ice Bar, cocktails are served up 'in ice'; while the hotel is required by law to have fire extinguishers, despite threat of fire being unlikely . The Art suite, Borderland, designed by artist Eryk Marks and interior designer Tomasz Czajkowski, uses lighting to stunning effect . Art suites Abject Beauty by Julia Gamborg Nielsen and Lotta Lampa, left, and Two as one, by Jose Carlos Cabello Millan, right . It seems ice hotel visitors are a fruity lot: Last year, one room featured a female bust made entirely of ice. Two prominent features were practically worn down to nothing by the end of the season. The hotel offers all kinds of tours, from dog sledding to snowmobiling through the Narnia-like forests, where trees wear their heavy snow like thick fur coats. But wrap up warm. A night snow mobile excursion leaves me with frostbite, and twenty minutes into my reindeer sledding experience, I am alone in a forest at minus 35. My slightly clapped out reindeer won't run for love nor money, which results in me letting out some embarrassing, desperate go faster noises. Meanwhile another member of the team falls off three times, and even the reindeers start to frost over. But the best is saved for my last night. 'The Lights, they're massive,' somebody cries in the Homestead restaurant, a listed wood clad building, offering Ice Hotel customers all manner of cockle-warming local dishes. I stumble outside as fast as is possible in my boiler suit, eight pairs of socks, two hats, and three balaclavas, and look up. The Aurora is alive. The cold has stopped burning, and I lie in a mound of snow taking photographs. My camera growls and dies. The whole black starry night is lit up in green with streaks like a UFO jet stream and burning white strands circle above. Not everything survives the cold here, but if you can, it's well worth a night at the Ice Hotel.","The Ice hotel in Jukkasarvi, northern Sweden, gets over 50,000 visitors between December and April .

"A Utah teenager’s dress worn to a school dance over the weekend got the cold shoulder from administrators, who forced the girl to wear a winter coat to cover up her bare arms. Gabi Finlayson, 15, a student at Lone Peak High School in Highland, showed up at the Preference Dance last Saturday wearing a delicate pink lace gown with a high neck and a full maxi skirt. However, the teenager was found to be in violation of the school's strict dress code because her shoulders and arms were exposed. She got the cold shoulder: Gabi Finlayson, 15, showed up to her school dance in this delicate dress inspired by Audrey Hepburn, only to be told by a school official to cover up her bare shoulders with a coat . Speaking to the station KUTV, the high schooler said she was left feeling 'embarrassed' and ‘insulted’ when a school official approached her in the middle of the party and asked her to put on a shawl or a coat. 'I didn't want to make a big scene so I said, ‘yes.’ I had a coat in the car so I had to go back and get it,' said Gabi. The young woman said she came away feeling angry and humiliated after being forced to wear a coat over her conservative dress for the entire duration of the party. 'Somehow my shoulders are sexualized,' Finlayson said. 'Like it's my responsibility to make sure the boys’ thoughts are not unclean.' Finlayson said she could not have imagined that anyone at the school would find her Parisian dress, inspired by the late actress and fashion icon Audrey Hepburn, objectionable or overly revealing. Restrictive: Lone Peak High School in Highland, Utah, has a very strict dress code prohibiting girls from wearing backless dresses, outfits with thin straps or cleavage . Dressed down: Gabi said she came away feeling humiliated after being body-shamed in public . Gabi argued that some of her schoolmates turned up at the event wearing outfits that were much shorter and tighter than hers, but they were not asked to cover up. Besides Finlayson, three other students out of 1,200 were asked to cover up their shoulders on the night of the dance, according to Lone Peak high Principal Rhonda Bromley. Wrong message: Gabi and her mother accused the school of sexualizing young girls and their bodies . Miss Bromley insisted that all of the students are aware of the school's dress code for formal events, which prohibits teens from wearing backless dresses below the shoulder blades, outfits featuring straps narrower than 2inches or garments with a cleavage. According to the rules, revealing formal wear must be covered with a shawl, a shrug or a bolero 'at all times.' Gabi's mother, Kristy Maxfield Kimball, has come out in support of her daughter accusing the school of sexualizing young girls and sending them a negative message that they should be ashamed of their bodies. ‘How have we gotten to the point that we look at shoulders as if they're somehow pornographic?’ Kimball said. On her Facebook page, Mrs Kimball speculated whether the school administration simply wants girls to dress in accordance with Mormon values. 'Girls [sic] bodies are not sexual objects and religious perspectives should not be imposed at a public school. Shoulders are not sexual!!!' Gabi's mother fumed. Principal Bromley countered by insisting that Lone Peak's policies regarding formal wear have been accepted by the entire school community, and that the person who was tasked with enforcing the dress code at the dance did so in a 'careful and sensitive way.' On her part, Gabi suggested that instead of forcing girls to cover up their bodies, we as a society should teach boys not to treat them as sex objects created for their pleasure.","Gabi Finlayson, 15, attended Preference Dance at Lone Peak High School in Highland, Utah, Saturday .

While the veterinarian wasn't expecting Gizelle to live past Christmas, the pair spent the dog's second to last day sitting by the ocean together in Maine earlier this month. Miss Watt, who is now working on a book about her adventures with Gizelle, said that it was a fitting end to their time together. 'Even in the emptiness of that beach that day, I could see Gizelle running free long the shore, rolling in the sand, awkwardly spooked by approaching waves,' she wrote.

"This is the shocking moment balaclava-wearing protesters used iron bars to beat a huntsmaster unconscious during a meet. Mike Lane, Joint Master of the Tedworth Hunt in Wiltshire, had been attempting to calm saboteurs when he was punched, kicked, spat on and left needing hospital treatment. The attack happened  after a fractious day of confrontations during a drag hunt on Saturday, when the masked group followed the hunt from the kennels in the morning. Scroll down for video . A protester wearing camouflage trousers and a balaclava attacks one of the huntsmen with what has been described as 'iron bars on a rope' The masked group are seen swinging iron bars as the man jumps back in defence before he is knocked out . Mike Lane can be seen lying on the floor (right) after he slipped over and while on the ground was kicked in the head twice and knocked out . The 39-year-old explained that he had become upset after they were spraying the dogs with citronella spray - a harmless solution used to train nuisance dogs. He said: 'We were packing up just after 4pm and it got quite violent. Five or six of them came across to where we were all parked and started to make a nuisance of themselves. 'I went over to try to calm it all down and one of them spat in my face. I was then punched by another and a scuffle broke out. 'I slipped over and on the ground one of them kicked me in the head twice and knocked me out.' He added that after that, he has no recollection of what happened, but recalls 'iron bars being swung on lengths of rope'. 'Luckily there were still enough people around who came to my aid and they ran back to their vehicles and drove off at speed. Mr Lane said the group had been 'harassing' them throughout the drag hunt and were 'spraying the hounds with citronella spray' and he had remonstrated with them when the scuffle broke out . He was taken to the Great Western Hospital in Swindon and  treated for concussion and several broken teeth . 'Lots of people videoed what happened, and it is quite disconcerting to see yourself being knocked out on film.' Police have now launched a major investigating into the incident, which happened near the village of Everleigh in Wiltshire as the meet closed, and are trying to identify those responsible. Mr Lane was taken to the Great Western Hospital in Swindon where he was treated for concussion and several broken teeth. A spokeswoman for Wiltshire Police said: 'The Tedworth Hunt had been out on a drag hunt and according to the hunt, a group of up to a dozen people - both men and women - wearing balaclavas had been harassing the hunt throughout the day. 'The protesters had left the scene by the time police arrived. 'We can confirm that a 39-year-old man from the Marlborough area who is involved with the hunt was assaulted and needed treatment at Great Western Hospital. Mike Lane, 39, is the Joint Master of the Tedworth Hunt and sustained injuries that left him needing hospital treatment following the attack in Everleigh, Wiltshire, on Saturday . 'The man was knocked to the ground and received injuries to the head and back and was briefly unconscious. Police officers gave him first aid until an ambulance arrived. 'We are gathering evidence from witnesses, including video and still images recorded by Tedworth Hunt supporters.' Police said they are treating the case as a serious incident of ABH and potential public disorder. Inspector Paul Longden, of Wiltshire Police, said: 'Whilst we have no issue with people lawfully protesting, this was a totally unacceptable assault involving a group of men and women wearing balaclavas. 'We are making every effort to find and bring to justice the people who inflicted these injuries.' The incident is the latest in a long line of violent confrontations between hunt saboteurs and hunts, with both sides claiming the other to be the more violent. Tim Bonner, campaign director for the Countryside Alliance, said the incident showed that saboteurs needed to 'unmask'. The hunt saboteurs were captured on camera by hunt members but are almost completely covered up . The police has described the attack as 'totally unacceptable' and has launched an investigation to try and identify those responsible . 'This was a particularly nasty and cowardly attack by people who hoped by wearing face coverings they would avoid prosecution,' he said. 'The number of people involved in saboteur activities is far fewer than in the past, however we are concerned that the extremists who remain are increasingly resorting to violence. 'There have been a number of incidents over the past few years involving assaults on hunt staff and supporters by people who have masked their identities. 'We are particularly worried about the increasing tendency to violence by those wearing balaclavas and face coverings in a bid to escape the law. 'We call upon the police to use their powers, wherever possible, to unmask people who wear face coverings to hunt meets before there is violence.' Mr Lane has been advised to rest for at least a week following the attack.

"The father: Video of this alleged baby killer holding a police doll and apologizing to it was shown at his murder trial on Monday for the death of baby Ada . A father accused of killing his 21-day-old daughter sat in a Sacramento police station cradling a baby doll saying 'Daddy is so sorry. Daddy didn't mean it,' in a video shown at his murder trial on Monday. Alleged killer Alias James McLaughlin, 22, told Detective Mark Johnson following his May 2013 arrest that he put his baby, Ada Ann Marie Lam-McLaughlin, down on the ground angrily as she wept uncontrollably. He reenacted his motions on a police mannequin as he spoke. 'I guess you could say I put her down angrily. I did hear the back of her head kind of cling against the ground,' McLaughlin told Johnson. The most chilling confession occurred moments later as Johnson left the interview room at the Sacramento Police Department for just a few minutes with an interview camera secretly recording the alleged killer's every move. McLaughlin picked up the police mannequin one more time and held it as though it were his own deceased child. 'Has Daddy set you free now?' McLaughlin asked the doll. 'Has Daddy set you free? You know, I just miss you, baby girl. I just want to see you one more time, just hold you one more time. I just want to hold you. I’m sorry. Daddy is so sorry. Daddy is so sorry. Daddy is so sorry. Daddy didn’t mean it. You know Daddy loves you. You know Daddy loves you. I didn’t mean it. I didn’t mean it. I didn’t mean it,' he said as the camera recorded his soliloquy. The detective then re-entered the room to tell McLaughlin he was being arrested for murder. 'You put her down in an angry way,' Johnson told McLaughlin. 'You heard, and you knew what happened.' 'I didn’t murder her,' McLaughlin responded. 'You fractured her skull and it killed her,' the detective retorted. 'I didn’t murder her, sir. … I need to speak to someone.' The Sacramento Bee reported that Deputy District Attorney Sheri Greco played the tape on Monday to a Sacramento Superior Court jury for McLaughlin's murder trial. The baby's mother Dalena Lam testified against McLaughlin last week and said that he 'flipped out' on the morning of May 10, 2013 because  21-day-old Ada was crying. She claims that McLaughlin violently put a pacifier in the baby's mouth then tried to force feed her milk. On trial for murder: Alias McLaughlin, pictured shortly after the arrest for his daughters death in 2013, now stands trial for murder . Lam said her former boyfriend's actions took a more physical turn as he then shook the baby's ankles and then pushed the baby onto the floor with force. Lam says she tried to stop McLaughlin but that he shoved her off, bruising her arms and chest. McLaughlin admitted to a misdemeanor battery of Lam two years ago in Rocklin. The Sacramento Bee reports that on Tuesday Forensic pathologist Dr. Gregory Reiber joined the prosecution to show the jury autopsy photos of the baby girl along with an example of what subdural hemorrhaging looks like. Reiber motioned with a laser pointer to a 3.8 centimeter crack at the top of the child's skull. He also showed the jury the subarachnoid hemorrhage in the baby's brain as a result from the skull fracture. The bleeding is, 'very typical of a severe diffuse brain injury,' said Reiber. 'Basically, the entire brain was injured,' he continued not the damage was, 'at the very high end of the scale for traumatic brain injury for an infant.' 'It basically causes multiple centers of the brain to shut down,' said Reiber of the truly severe injury. History: Alias James McLaughlin also admitted to a misdemeanor battery of his girlfriend  Dalena Lam two years before he was arrested for his daughter's murder . Reiber explained that the fracture was in line with a 1 meter fall onto a hard surface. 'This is a very severe amount of force,' Reiber told the courtroom. The doctor was then handed a baby mannequin by the prosecutor that was comparable in size to the infant girl. In an eerie parallel, the doctor took the doll and slammed it head first onto the witness stand with the same force he believed was used on baby Ada. As McLaughlin watched the Forensic Pathologist explain the alleged murder he sat expressionless. McLaughlin chose not to testify in the trial. He once told a detective he thought his daughter Ada died by choking on her milk but later changed his story. In the same interview, McLaughlin reportedly looked over a car magazine and tried striking up a conversation with the detective about Mustangs, Camaros, and Corvettes. The detective eventually intervened and said, 'We gotta talk about more important stuff,' such as, 'you know, your baby.' That's when McLaughlin chucked away the story where he claimed his baby choked on her milk and instead confessed to 'angrily' laying her on the ground. 'Just the impact of me going like this, and the force – that’s all I did,' McLaughlin said. 'And I heard – I knew at that moment. I knew at that moment.' On May 10, the day that baby Ada died, her troubled mother attempted to put her in a hot bath because her body grew cold. The baby later stopped breathing so her parents called police at 3:01 pm and she was later pronounced dead at 6:55 p.m. Johnson arrested McLaughlin for murder later that day. 'OK,' Johnson said, before telling McLaughlin he first needed to remove all his body piercings. “I need you to take your jewelry out, ’cause you can’t go to jail with your jewelry on.'","Alias James McLaughlin, accused of killing his infant daughter, sat in a Sacramento police station cradling a baby doll saying 'Daddy didn't mean it'

"A chicken farmer has been handed over £18,000 in compensation after his birds stopped laying eggs because they became terrified by low-flying Apache helicopters. The farmer in the Sussex village of Ninfield received  £18,708 from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) after claiming his birds were so frightened by the loud noise of the helicopter that egg production fell. The payout was just one of four last year made to poultry farmers who said that their chickens were so scared by military aircraft that they trampled one another death and that the survivors were so terrified by the noise, the stopped laying eggs. A map showing some of the compensation payouts made by the Ministry of Defence due to low-flying incidents across the UK last year . It comes as figures released under the Freedom of Information Act showed that the MoD paid out a total of £1.1million in compensation due low flying incidents in 2014. Payments were also made to people who lost horses, cows and puppies, which were also spooked by the noise of the military aircraft. The figures also showed that the MoD sanctioned a payment of £25,000 to a falconry centre in Derbyshire which lost a number of precious birds of prey when a helicopter flew over it. It is believed around eight birds including owls, hawks and falcons were killed in the incident when the terrified birds fatally injured themselves by flying full speed into the wire walls of the aviary trying to get away from the noise. Many of the compensation payouts come with confidentially agreements so that people agree not to disclose what they have been paid for. Other payments included £42,700 for cows that died after being scared by a Puma helicopter in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, and £20,000 for an injured horse that lost its foal in a case in Dyfed, Wales. The MoD also sanctioned £1,286 to repair a bus shelter in Worthy Down, Winchester, that was damaged by a low-flying Chinook helicopter and £2,590 after a Lynx helicopter damaged the roof of a home in Hungerford, Berkshire. Often the biggest payouts are made to horse riders who suffer injuries when their animals bolt after being spooked by the military aircraft. A farmer in Ninfield, Sussex received the compensation after claiming that his chickens stopped laying eggs after becoming terrified of the noise made by low-flying Apache helicopters (file picture) In the previous year the biggest payment was £83,125 to a person who suffered severe head injuries after being knocked over by a horse which had been scared by a Chinook helicopter. Last year also saw £2,200 paid to owner of a parrot from Ayrshire which died after being scared by a Hercules transport plane, which flew over its owner’s home. There has also been compensation paid to members of a therapy group whose tranquillity was disturbed by the aircraft and the vet bills paid of a parrot which broke both its legs after being scared. A MoD spokesperson said: 'Flying training is carried out across the UK to develop and practice the techniques needed on operations. 'The MOD treats all flying complaints seriously and while we have a responsibility to ensure that military aircrews are fully trained and prepared for operational duty, we continue to do all we can to minimise disturbance to the public.' An MoD report said low-flying compensation claims required particularly careful monitoring to identify potentially fraudulent claims. But a spokesman for the TaxPayers' Alliance said: 'Clearly many individuals across the country rely on livestock and animals for their livelihood, so it is right that compensation is paid out if the MoD has affected that. 'The level of spending though is shockingly high, and those responsible for errors in planning at the department must be held accountable.'","Farmer in Ninfield, Sussex received £18,708 from the Ministry of Defence .

"A Swedish public service reporter has come under fire for asking Crown Princess Victoria about her ‘Nazi’ grandfather while at the Auschwitz memorial service. The Crown Princess of Sweden attended yesterday’s event on the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the former Nazi concentration camp, alongside hundreds of survivors and  dignitaries. Flanked by two Auschwitz survivors, Crown Princess Victoria was asked if she had ‘considered the family history’ during the ceremony. Scroll down for video . Outrage: A reporter asked Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden about her maternal grandfather, who was a Nazi sympathiser in the 1930s, at the Auschwitz memorial service . Ancestor: Her grandfather Walther Sommerlath had joined the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP), more commonly known as the Nazi Party, as an expatriate in Brazil in 1934 . Rolf Fredriksson, a reporter for Swedish public service channel Sveriges Television, interviewed the Crown Princess and Auschwitz survivors Hédi Fried och Emerich Roth at the ceremony. ‘Has the Crown Princess considered the family history?,' he asked. 'There are relatives further back who were Nazi supporters,’ Mr Fredriksson added before highlighting the achievement of the Crown Princess’s great uncle, diplomat Folke Bernadotte, who saved thousands from the Nazi camps. The Crown Princess did not address the line of question and instead stared Mr Fredriksson down as she spoke. Strange ask: Crown Princess Victoria, pictured yesterday, found question 'out of context' ‘Nazism is something horrifying and it is one of humanities worst histories,’ the 36-year-old first-in-line said. ‘It is a long history. We have a lot of information and one can take part of that if one so wishes.’ Representatives of the Royal Court of Sweden were critical of the question, and said that it had been unjustified. 'You wonder what the point was. In this instance, the Crown Princess was standing with two elderly people, survivors of the Holocaust,' said Royal head of press Margareta Thorgren. Queen Silvia of Sweden, Crown Princess Victoria’s mother, was born in Germany in 1943, the daughter of businessman Walther Sommerlath and his Brazilian wife Alice de Toledo Sommerlath. Walther Sommerlath had joined the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP), more commonly known as the Nazi Party, as an expatriate in Brazil in 1934. Mr Sommerlath has been accused of taking part in the 'aryanisation' of Jewish-owned businesses in Germany, after buying a metal engineering plant in Berlin from a Jewish engineer for a knock-down price in 1939. Queen Silvia has publicly apologised on behalf of her father, saying she only found out about his former NSDAP membership as an adult. On the opposite side of the family tree is diplomat Folke Bernadotte, King Carl XVI Gustav’s godfather and his father’s cousin. During the Second World War, Count Bernadotte negotiated the release of about 31,000 prisoners from German concentration camps, including 450 Danish Jews from Theresienstadt. After the war he worked as a UN mediator between Israel and Palestine, before he was assassinated in Jerusalem in 1948. Crown Princess Victoria’s daughter Estelle, third in line to the throne, is named after his wife. There's a time and place: Crown Princess Victoria, pictured with Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark, was asked about her family history while attending the ceremony for the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz . Family history: Princess Victoria's (left) grandfather and Queen Silvia's (right) father, Walther Sommerlath, was a member of the National Socialist German Workers' Party in the 1930s . The broadcast of the interview with the Crown Princess caused outrage on social media in Sweden. A number of people accused Sveriges Television of trying to blame the Crown Princess for her grandfather’s actions, with one tweeter calling reporter Mr Fredriksson a 'coconut,' Aftonbladet reports. Moderate Party MP Maria Abrahamsson tweeted: ‘So incredible tasteless of @rolffred in Auschwitz today to try to play the Crown Princess’s grandfather and Folke Bernadotte against each other’. ‘Tasteless of the journalist to pressure Crown Princess Victoria about her family’s past in Auschwitz,’ Swedish Bar Association's general secretary Anne Ramberg tweeted. Ms Thorgren added that Crown Princess's reaction had been 'about the same as on social media'. 'It felt like the question did not belong in the context. It meant more to her to be there and honour the victims of the Holocaust'. Rolf Fredriksson himself defended his question, tweeting: 'No blame on next generations, but they are responsible for debate.’","Reporter under fire for interview with Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden .

"A former Playboy model accused of assaulting two women at the same nightclub just months apart will fight one of the charges, a court has heard. Georgina Gosden, 25, made a brief appearance in Townsville Magistrates Court on Tuesday to contest a charge laid against her for allegedly attacking a former school friend at the Mad Cow nightclub. Gosden, from Townsville in north Queensland, is said to have punched the 25-year-old in the face a number of times on April 20 last year, Townsville Bulletin reported. Scroll down for video . Georgina Gosden, 25, is a model for Playboy and has contested an assault charge laid against her . It is alleged Gosden punched a woman in the face at Mad Cow Tavern in Townsville, on April 20 2014 . Phil Rennick, the model's solicitor, requested that his client's charge of assault occasioning bodily harm be put down for a summary hearing. The matter was adjourned by Magistrate Ross Mack until Friday so police can review their information, but the accused will not be required to attend court again. The glamour model previously fronted court in December last year accused of punching a 21-year-old woman in a similar attack, at the same nightspot - Mad Cow Tavern. She was granted bail, and is not contesting this charge according to Mr Rennick. She also has one other assault charge against her for allegedly punching a woman at the same bar in December . On December 8 Magistrate Cathy Wadley agreed to let Gosden out on bail, despite police prosecutor Errica Forde advising against it with fears the model would re-offend, Townsville Bulletin reported at the time. Gosden allegedly punched a 21-year-old woman in the face at Mad Cow Tavern on Sunday about 10.40pm. The victim walked into the nightclub while the model was already inside. It is alleged Gosden then got up from where she was sitting, ran towards the woman and punched her in the face. Court documents say the woman was known to Gosden who told police 'she was going to find her [the victim]'. In April's incident, the alleged victim went to school with Gosden and said the model came out of nowhere and punched her in the face. Gosden stands accused of carrying out two similar attacks about seven months apart . She appeared in Townsville Magistrates Court on Tuesday, where her solicitor asked the charge to be put down for a summary hearing . Gosden signed with Playboy earlier this year and described herself as a 'tomboy' in high school in a video on its YouTube channel . 'I walked inside the nightclub, I turned to my right and had only taken about three steps and was looking around. Then I saw someone in a long green fluorescent skirt coming ­towards me quickly from my left,' the victim told police, according to the Bulletin. In a video on the Playboy YouTube channel, Gosden said she was a horse riding instructor who grew up in Townsville and was born in England. She described herself as 'outgoing' and a 'fun-type of girl'. 'I teach young kids to ride horses. It’s very rewarding. I’ve been riding since I was 9, I try to ride horses every day,' Gosden said. April's incident allegedly involved her punching another woman several times in the face . Gosden said she was a horse riding instructor who was not 'very girly' when she was in high school . She was granted bail by the magistrate and her case was adjourned until Friday . Despite her budding career as a glamour model, Gosden confessed she was not 'very girly' when she was younger. 'The type of girl I was in high school, I was definitely a tomboy. I wore baggy shirts and board shorts,' she said. 'I wasn't very girly until a lot later on when I started to get those curves in all the right places.' The model's case will be heard in court again in January. Gosden will be opposing the charges that have been brought against her.

"Dozens of primary school children are suspended every year for being drunk or high on drugs, shocking figures reveal. Once a week during term time an exclusion order is imposed on under-11s for offences including smoking, alcohol abuse or drug dealing. At secondary school the situation is even worse, with 6,500 pupils excluded in 2012-13, sparking warnings that parents and teachers are 'losing the battle' against substance abuse. In 2012-13, 40 children at primary schools in England were given temporary exclusions over drink and drugs, meaning more than one pupil aged 5-11 was suspended every week during term-time . Figures released in parliament this week show that in 2012-13, 40 children at primary schools in England were given temporary exclusions over drink and drugs. The Department for Education said it included alcohol abuse, drug dealing, inappropriate use of prescribed drugs, possession of illegal drugs, smoking and substance abuse. There are 39 weeks in the average school term, meaning more than one pupil aged 5-11 is suspended every week. Tory MP Andrew Griffiths, who obtained the figures, told MailOnline: 'The striking thing is that 40 primary school children have been excluded because they turned up drunk or high. 'It is deeply worrying that so many children appear at school under the influence. 'We do have to ask what is happening to the parents of these children and are they being prosecuted. Clearly they are getting the drugs and alcohol from somewhere.' At secondary schools, 6,500 pupils were temporarily excluded in 2012-13, sparking warnings that parents and teachers are 'losing the battle' against substance abuse . The figures show that there were 6,590 drink and drug related fixed period suspensions in secondary schools in 2012-13, the latest year for which figures are available. Another 360 exclusions were imposed, where students were removed from the school permanently, accounting for one in 10 of all expulsions. The number of secondary school suspensions has fallen from 8,470 in 2009-10, but the number of expulsions has risen since 2010 from 290 to 360. Mr Griffths added: 'While it is encouraging that exclusions are down, we continue to fail to prevent young children from taking from the dangers of drugs and alcohol. 'We clearly need to do something urgently to bring those numbers down dramatically. Mr Griffiths, a patron of a drug and alcohol rehabilitation unit, added: 'We are continuing to lose the battle.' Chris Keates, General Secretary of the NASUWT said: 'All too often the issues facing primary schools with regard to pupil behaviour and exclusion are underestimated. 'These figures exemplify the challenges primary teachers are facing. 'The problems for schools are now being exacerbated by the cuts to local authority funding which have resulted in specialist provision on which schools have relied being reduced or removed. 'Early intervention is essential to prevent these children being lost to the education service.' A Department for Education spokesman said: 'Prohibited items including alcohol and drugs have no place whatsoever in the classroom. We have introduced a range of powers for teachers to ensure discipline, behaviour and safety are maintained. 'Our guidance on behaviour, clarifies what headteachers can do to properly discipline disruptive pupils and frees up teachers' time and energy, allowing them to focus on what they do best – teaching and inspiring our next generation. 'Teachers now have stronger powers to search pupils, when they suspect they may be in possession of a prohibited item. Changes to the system mean a school's decision to exclude a pupil can no longer be overruled. Teachers can use reasonable force to remove disruptive pupils from the classroom when necessary.'","40 children aged 5-11 excluded for alcohol and drugs in England in a year .

"The head of art at a prestigious grammar school who began a lesbian affair with a teenage pupil has been banned from teaching for life. Debbie Evans, 55, who taught at South Wilts Grammar School in Salisbury for 23 years, struck up a sexual relationship with the girl in 2011, after the teenager fell ill at school and she supported her. The National College of Teaching and Leadership (NCTL) disciplinary panel was told that Evans began teaching at the school in 1990, had a previously unblemished career as Head of Art and was a respected member of the team. But after the girl joined the school in 2010 a sexual relationship developed between them, and continued after the pupil - who was over 16 -  left the school. Debbie Evans, 55, who taught at South Wilts Grammar School  for 23 years, struck up a sexual relationship with the girl in 2011, after the teenager fell ill at school and the teacher supported her (file picture) The panel was told that in May 2011, the girl - referred to as Student A  - was taken ill at the school and was helped by Ms Evans. Then, that summer, the teacher was invited to a meal at Student A's home and began to give her lifts to and from school. In late 2011 Student A turned 18, and the following month she and Ms Evans went for a meal where it was alleged that they kissed, marking the start of their sexual relationship. The girl finished sixth form in July 2012, but it was claimed that the relationship continued until October 2013. The student's mother contacted the school on October 27, 2013, to discuss unspecified concerns about a teacher. On October 31 2013, Ms Evans resigned with effect from 31 December 2013. But meanwhile, on November 11 2013, Student A's parents reported the alleged relationship to senior staff. The disciplinary panel findings say Evans admitted that she had 'abused her position of trust by entering into an inappropriate relationship, including of a sexual nature' with the girl. The findings add that her conduct fell 'significantly short of the standards expected of the profession.' The National College of Teaching and Leadership (NCTL) disciplinary panel was told that Evans  was a respected member of the team. But after the girl joined the school in 2010 a sexual relationship developed between them. It continued after the girl, who was 18, left the school . Imposing the ban on behalf of the Education Secretary, NCTL official, Paul Heathcote, said Evans had been found to have 'abused her position of trust,' that her actions were 'sexually motivated' and had caused the girl emotional harm. He said the disciplinary panel considered she was guilty of 'serious sexual misconduct.' He continued : 'Ms Evans has shown insight into her actions and is remorseful. She has co-operated with this process and the panel have judged that she does not pose a continuing threat to pupils. 'However, having paid due regard to the maintenance of public confidence in the profession and the declaring and upholding of proper standards of conduct, the panel have recommended that the order should be without the opportunity for an application to have it set aside. I agree with this recommendation.' The ban stipulates that she will not be allowed to apply to have the ban set aside. She can, however, appeal against the ban to the High Court.","Debbie Evans, 55, taught at South Wilts Grammar School for 23 years .

"Famous faces from the world of TV, film, politics and literature have turned their casual scribbles into a good cause. This year celebrity doodlers from Bill Nighy and Julian Fellowes to Lorraine Kelly and Penny Lancaster and their sketches will feature alongside dozens more in a ten day eBay auction starting on National Doodle Day, Friday, 6 February, in aid of Epilepsy Action. But can you match the celebs to their scribbles? Scroll down to see how well you do. 1. This artist, left, who recently met Kate Middleton, is known for his flamboyant style and trademark urns. 2. This drawing (right) reflects the flame-haired personality's  regal connections and  effervescent personality . 3. This Canadian writer is  famous for futuristic and feminist stories about handmaids and edible women . The stars of the line-up this year include Grayson Perry who has drawn one of his trademark art works for the auction and Sarah, Duchess of York, who shares a positive message on her picture. They hope their pictures will sell for thousands, raising cash for the charity. But for those who fancy giving celebrities a run for their money can now create, upload and share doodles on the official website while competing for prizes. Speaking about this year's campaign, a spokesperson for the charity said: 'Every year we’re overwhelmed by support from celebrities and always look forward to seeing the variety and creativity of the doodles they send in. 'National Doodle Day is always a terrific success, raising thousands of pounds for Epilepsy Action. 'The highest-grossing doodle ever sold for over £1,600, but each one makes a huge difference to people with epilepsy and their families.' 4. She played Ab Fab's Patsy Stone and this sweetie darling is famous for her enthusiasm for everything . 5.

Epilepsy affects around one in every 100 people in the UK alone and 87 people are diagnosed with the condition every day. So what do the stars' doodles say about them? More than meets the eye, if handwriting analyst Ruth Rostron's theory is anything to go by. In fact, she believes that what you choose to doodle actually reveals volumes about your personality and mood. Ruth said: 'Symbols that recur in doodles relate to basic human needs for love, security and survival. 'Interpretation of a particular doodle will depend on the way it has been drawn and the context but there are some common shapes that people doodle which have a real meaning.' English broadcaster, journalist and author, Sir Michael Parkinson, left, and skier Chemmy Alcott also got involved in the charitable cause . Joanna Lumley put her colouful doodle to good use, helping to raise money for Epilepsy Action . 8. Left, this blonde athlete enjoys life on the slopes... at high speed and 9. it's surprising that a left wing politician known for his love of newts would draw a picture of a frog (right) Expert doodler and comic story writer Liz Pichon, who penned the book, Tom Gates: Extra Special Treats ... Not,  lifted the lid on what our doodles really mean, and you'll be surprised by what your mindless scribbles reveal. For instance, one leggy celebrity, known for marrying a famous British rocker, included a boat in her doodle . The type of boat someone doodles and its relative size and stability determines its interpretation - the water around the boat indicates whether emotions are tranquil or turbulent, says Liz. If the boat is  on a calm sea, it indicates the individual is self-assured, enjoys luxury and is dreaming of a holiday. 10. This much-loved actor, famous for his lithe figure, dry humour, floppy blonde hair and glasses captioned his picture 'May the god of cheerfulness have children in your mind' 11. She's the leggy wife of one of Britain's favourite Seventies rockers and mother to their two children. She added the phrase:  'May all the starts shine bright to bring you happiness in the New Year!' to her doodle . Joanna Lumley's scribble is filled with love hearts. A symbol of love and romance, heart doodles suggest an affectionate, sentimental, emotional and romantic person, or someone dreaming of love, marriage and/or sex, says Liz. Martin Clunes has drawn an elephant because, he claims, it's the only thing he can draw. According to Liz's theory, different animals have typical characteristics and also express moods. Domestic animals are doodled by those who are home-loving, like their creature comforts and tend to be affectionate. If they’re curled up it could suggest they are feeling defensive. Actor Bill Nighy and artist Grayson Perry added their own scribbles to the charity auction . 12. This clown was drawn by a northern comedian who was big in the Seventies and Eighties, now his daughter has her own Saturday night Radio 2 show . Jungle animals reflect an aggressive, macho or frustrated nature, while caged animals could indicate a person is feeling trapped. One of our foremost winter athletes has sketched lots of stars. Stars, says Liz, suggest aspiration and ambition and are doodled by those determined to succeed. They also indicate an intellectual or spiritual nature, or someone who is optimistic, a bit of a dreamer or romanticises. This analysis, then, befits the an alpine ski racer who competes on the World Cup circuit in all five disciplines and starred on the ITV reality show Dancing on Ice in 2012.

"Two machete-wielding thugs have been jailed after they attacked an innocent father caring for his disabled son at their home after mistaking him for a drug dealer. Samuel Madine, 25, and 18-year-old Mark Kirkwood intended to steal a drugs haul in the raid but got the wrong address and attacked the unsuspecting father at knife point as he protected his 14-year-old child. The victim had been at home in St Annes, Lancashire, watching TV when the pair along with a third accomplice burst into his flat and hacked at the father's arm, shouting 'Where's the stuff?' Samuel Madine, left, and Mark Kirkwood, right, who have been jailed after attack an innocent father at his home after mistaking him for a drug dealer . They then ransacked the property with the victims insisting they had no idea what the gang was talking about. The men also stole a wallet, watch and a bluetooth speaker. The father and son, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were so traumatised by their ordeal, that the boy refused to return home. The father also suffered blood poisoning from a wound in his elbow inflicted with the machete and his son's medication had to be increased. At Burnley Crown Court, Madine, of Blackpool admitted robbery and was jailed for six years and four months. Kirkwood, also of Blackpool, was convicted of two counts of robbery after a trial and was sentenced to eight years in prison. They had almost 100 previous convictions between them. Prosecutor Richard Bennett said the incident began at about 9.45pm on May 10 last year when the father and son heard the sound of breaking glass. Samuel Madine, who was jokingly placed in handcuffs during a day out with friends. He admitted robbery and was jailed for six years and four months following the attack on the innocent man and his son . The father went to check to see if he could see anything, found nothing, so both ignored the noise. But about 30 minutes later, the pair were in the lounge watching television when they heard voices. The father went into the hallway and saw three men standing at the top of the stairs. The first man immediately rushed at the him agitated and shouting, 'Where’s the stuff?' Mr Bennett added that the father was pushed back onto the sofa next to his son and the first man then produced a machete and began to wave it around. The father was struck on the arm while his son was hit on the leg and his shin was gashed. The 14-year-old was also struck in the face with the handle of the machete and he suffered a smashed tooth. The second man in the gang had a baseball bat while the third man was armed with a carving knife with a six inch blade. The prosecutor said the defendants made off having snatched the father’s wallet and £85 cash. A watch and Bluetooth speaker were also taken as well as both victims’ mobile phones. The father and son then waited a couple of minutes to make sure the intruders had left before dialling 999. They were taken to hospital for treatment to their injuries. Mr Bennett explained: 'A blood smear was found on the wall near to the entrance of the flat which transpired to come from Madine. Kirkwood’s fingerprints were on the inside of the entrance door of the flat. Madine was arrested on May 15. 'He was interviewed and declined to comment, except to admit the blood stain would have come from him. 'Kirkwood was arrested on November 19. He also declined to comment to the police when he was interviewed.' The prosecutor read a victim impact statement, where the father, who is his son’s full-time carer, told police: 'This incident has had a massive effect on both our lives.' He said his son suffered from several medical conditions. The father went on: 'On top of his other issues, he was particularly affected by the fact he had to attend court.' The father said the blood poisoning made him feel very unwell and he had to take antibiotics. He continued: 'My son was completely unable to return to our home address. He has never been back and it’s caused us to move. 'At home I am anxious and constantly on edge, as if anticipating somebody is going to come through the door at any time.' The father also explained how he now had to take a tablet to sleep and the teenager’s medication  had to be increased. He added: 'He just doesn't want to spend time in a room on his own.' Mr Bennett also added Madine had 51 offences on his record and Kirkwood had committed 31 previous offences, including robbery. The pair were jailed for a total of 15 years at Burnley Crown Court, pictured, for their part in the attack on the father and son . The third man in the raid had not been apprehended. No property was recovered. Brendan Lally, for Madine, said immediately before the offence he had suffered the loss of a number of people who were dear to him and his father had been diagnosed with terminal cancer. Mr Lally said: 'He couldn't handle it and took drink and drugs to gross excess. 'The defendant wasn't issuing threats and wasn't involved in the planning of the offence. He is easily led and somebody who has deficits in terms of his ability to make decisions. He struggles in day-to-day life in terms of self-management.' Mr Lally said Madine’s father died two days after his arrest and added: 'The defendant is ashamed of his behaviour and he does appear to genuinely want to address his offending. He maintains he got involved very shortly before this offence took place.' Defending Kirkwood, Tom Lord said his client was 'immature and susceptible to pressure'. He added: 'He sought security from older, pro-criminal males and that is something that is identified as a catalyst for him becoming involved in this offence. 'He was a courier for a lot of older people and he delivered drugs. He accrued a drugs debt. He is an immature young man who was led astray by older, influential males, to whom he looked up.'","Samuel Madine and Mark Kirkwood intended to steal a drugs haul in a raid .

"Sufferers of debilitating conditions like dementia and Parkinson’s face a ‘postcode lottery’ on whether the NHS will pay for their care. Patients are 18 times more likely to have their care funded in some parts of England than others, government data has revealed. And those in the north are far more likely to receive financial help than those in the south east. In the worst area, South Reading, health authorities paid care bills for an average of just 13.2 patients per 50,000 people, while in South Tyneside 232.9 patients per 50,000 people received the help. Scroll down for video . Sufferers of conditions like dementia and Parkinson's face a 'postcode lottery' on whether the NHS will pay for their care. File image used . Patients living in Salford, Greater Manchester, were six times more likely to have their care paid for than six miles away in Trafford. And residents of Brent, Greater London, were a fifth as likely to receive the help as those living ten miles away in Richmond, according to figures published by the Health & Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC). The data showed the number of people in each Clinical Commissioning Group area (CCG) who received NHS Continuing Healthcare (CHC) – funding for the nursing home fees or home care visits of people with complex medical needs. Anyone with serious medical conditions, such as those in the final stages of degenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s or who are paralysed, should have their care funded by the NHS regardless of their personal finances. But with budgets squeezed, health authorities have been accused of failing to give the funding to patients who are eligible for it. The figures revealed staggering differences between regions as well as local areas. The Thames Valley was the worst region for providing free care, with only 30.9 patients per 50,000 people receiving the funds – less than half the national average of 69.5. By contrast, those in the Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear area were nearly twice as likely to receive free care than the national average. Scores of families from across the country have complained to charities about problems obtaining the funding, including suffering long delays and ‘intimidation’ by health authority boards during applications. Some have been forced to raid savings or sell their homes to pay care bills while they wait for, or appeal, a decision. Patients living in Salford, Greater Manchester (pictured), were six times more likely to have their care paid for than those six miles away in Trafford. File image used . Last year the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Parkinson’s and charity Parkinson’s UK carried out an inquiry into the Continuing Healthcare system which found it was ‘not fit for purpose’ and failed ‘vulnerable people and their families at a time when they need the most support’. The charity’s chief executive Steve Ford said last night: ‘More than a year has passed since we revealed the extent of the systemic failure of tick-box assessors to follow the correct procedures, and the Government is still sticking their head in the sand. ‘They must start holding those responsible for the failings in the NHS Continuing Healthcare system to account and bring an end to the current postcode lottery in care and abysmally poor practice.’ NHS staff and social workers have also reported being ‘under pressure’ to keep patients out of the scheme. Former adult social care manager at Devon County Council Bernie Crean, 60, quit his job in September after claiming he was pressured by NHS managers because he ‘refused to turn a blind eye’ when the health service ‘repeatedly denied funding’ to eligible patients. Mr Crean, from Plymouth, said: ‘We have got a massively flawed system and it is a country-wide problem. Those in the Cumbria area were nearly twice as likely to receive free care than the national average. Pictured is a file image of Workington, Cumbria . ‘It is not right for the NHS to look to solve its funding problem by making patients suffer and pushing people away.’ The HSCIC figures showed the number of patients receiving the care funding per 50,000 people aged 18 and over, according to GP practice populations, at the end of September. They did not take age or socioeconomic factors into account, so areas where there were a higher proportion of older people were more likely to have larger numbers requiring CHC. However the data shows the same trends as the previous figures released in June which were weighted to reflect population differences. More than 62,000 patients currently receive CHC in England compared with fewer than 59,000 at the same time last year, but campaigners believe up to 150,000 are entitled to it – and that is likely to increase as the population ages. An NHS England spokesperson said: ‘The number of people receiving NHS CHC funding can vary from area to area due to differences in population profiles and local services but to ensure a consistent and fair approach, CCGs follow the National Framework to establish eligibility.’","Sufferers of conditions face a 'postcode lottery' on NHS care funding .

"A £17-a-head children's party themed around Disney's Frozen that left disappointed children in tears has today been branded a 'dangerous' and 'shambolic nightmare' by parents. Organisers have apologised after the DJ played children Right Said Fred's 'I'm Too Sexy' and an actress playing one of the film's main character Princess Anna showed too much cleavage. Upset parents say their children were 'barged and pushed' around in 'dangerously' overcrowded rooms  and others were left 'hungry and crying' during and after the Disney-themed event. Parents have complained their children were 'barged and pushed' around in overcrowded rooms at the party (pictured) Parents also complained after DJs at the event played Said Right Fred's 'I'm Too Sexy' Mother Kathryn Marshall said her children were so squashed on the dance floor (pictured) they were unable to participate in many of the activities . Upset: Parents who took their children to a Frozen-themed party at Langley Park Sports and Social Club in Beckenham, have called the event a 'shambolic nightmare' after a series of blunders . The party, hosted by Perfect Kids Parties at Langley Park Sports and Social Club in Beckenham, south east London, has caused large numbers of complaints. Mother Jodie Wise-Steppel said: 'The whole event was shambolic. Sadly, the highlight was Anna's boobs literally spilling out of her top. 'The organisers were too greedy and didn't consider the consequences. 'Me and my children were barged, pushed and shoved.' Complaint: One mother said the actress playing the character Princess Anna showed too much of her cleavage at the event over the weekend . The chaotic event saw hundreds of adults and their children crammed into the venue, and the promised party lunch consisted of a small amount of sweets and other unhealthy foods, she said. Mrs Wise-Steppel added: 'The cake lady stormed out with her Frozen-themed cake. After just minutes, there wasn't any food left, and there weren't enough seats. 'I could have done a better job on the face painting. The staff were headless chickens all shouting at each other, and the sound system was like a two-year-old's karaoke machine.' Many of the disappointed parents slammed the events company on Twitter and Facebook, who have since deactivated their web accounts. One mother, who did not wish to be named, took her Frozen-mad three-year-old daughter to the event. She said: 'Last night I commented on Perfect Kids Parties Facebook page about the disappointment, as had others, but saw later that it was taken down as a page. 'I think it's not just a shame but at times bordered on chaotic and at worst could have been dangerous. 'All in all, my friends and I just left after 45 minutes, as our children, aged three and four had seen nothing, had no seat and missed the welcome cakes.' Kathryn Marshall took her five-year-old and seven-year-old daughters, but is now demanding a refund. She said: 'I was shocked at how badly planned and unsafe the event was. 'The kids were so squashed on the dance floor that they were unable to participate in any of the activities. 'We left after an hour with both girls crying. Not a great experience for something that cost us £35 and was supposed to be the highlight of our month.' She also slammed the choice of music after the DJ played inappropriate gay club anthem 'I'm too sexy' which includes the lyrics 'I'm too sexy for your party, no way I'm disco dancing.' Mother-of-two and part-time beautician Claire Jeffreys, 30, went to the expensive event with personal trainer partner Anthony Delamare and their two children. She said: 'We had such high hopes, but it was a massive let down. It was dangerous. There were too many people there and the kids were getting crushed. 'It was awful, really really dreadful - the kids were all packed in there like sardines in a can. We were all looking forward to it, but it was just a waste of time and money.' Party organisers were also criticised for playing songs such as Right Said Fred's (pictured) 'I'm Too Sexy' Perfect Kids Parties have vowed to change their ways after being swamped with complaints. A spokesman said: 'We have taken on board the honest feedback received from a minority of customers to make sure issues of parent overcrowding do not occur again and look forward to welcoming children to our future events. 'Children's safety is of paramount importance to us.' It's understood some parents have been contacted by Perfect Kids Parties saying it was considering their feedback and would respond to all queries within four days.","Parents say their children were left 'crying' after event over the weekend .

"Dean Martin, whose bakery in Kew, west London, is the only one in the world to produce custard tarts to the original 500-year-old recipe that Anne Boleyn was eating when she first met Henry VIII . The history of England could have been very different - but for one little Tudor tart. As the intrigue and machinations of the BBC adaptation of Hilary Mantel's book Wolf Hall grip the nation, a baker has revealed it was Henry VIII's desire for a custard tart that brought him and Anne Boleyn together. And it's a taste we can still have today, as a London baker makes the same pastries from the 500-year-old recipe that captivated the king all those centuries ago. The second episode of Wolf Hall is due to be screened tonight, with much of the episode focusing on the drama behind the Henry's bid to replace his queen Catherine of Aragon with his new love Anne Boleyn. Much has been made of the power of Anne's feminine wiles and how they drove the king to distraction. But a London bakery is now claiming that it was not Anne Boleyn's flat-chested charms that seduced the gluttonous king, but the 'delicious' Maids of Honour tarts she was devouring with her fellow ladies-in-waiting when the ill-fated couple first met. Dean Martin's bakery, Newens Tea House in Kew, west London is the only one in the world to produce the tarts to the original 500-year-old recipe. He said: 'When Henry VIII first set eyes on Anne, she was with other maids of honour eating these tarts, that were cooling from the oven on a sliver tray. 'The story goes he was so enchanted by the little tarts they were eating that he ordered the cook who made them to come and work for the Royal Palace exclusively and locked the recipe away so only he and his court could enjoy them. 'It is interesting to wonder whether the king would have fallen in love with Anne Boleyn if she had not been eating the tarts when he first met her. Maybe the course of English history would have been very different without the Maid of Honour tart.' Mr Martin said the recipe for the tart was kept exclusively by the palace until the 1700s when it was leaked by the palace cook to John Billet, a baker in nearby Richmond, west London, who began producing the delicacies for wealthy customers. By 1850, John Newens, a former apprentice at Billet's bakery, had opened his own baking business, bringing with him the secret recipe he had been taught. The original Maids of Honour recipe was passed down through the generations of the Newens family, who sold the bakery, and the secret recipe, to Mr Martin, 44, five years ago. A tray of Maids of Honour tarts at Newens tea house . in Kew, west London . Wolf Hall stars Damian Lewis as Henry VIII and Claire Foy as his ill-fated second wife Anne Boleyn . He said: 'This tart resembles Spanish and Portuguese custard tarts but tastes very different. It has a sweet, unctuous curd cheese filling inside a crisp butter pastry. It's a very comforting, English taste. 'They are best enjoyed cooling from the oven as Henry VIII ate them.' Mr Martin, who bought the business from the Newens family five years ago, said the bakery had seen a 'spike' in demand for the delicacy since the first episode of the  £7 million Machiavellian blockbuster TV series starring Damien Lewis and Mark Rylance on BBC2 last week. He added: 'We're already doubling our production of Maids of Honour tarts because we're expecting a big rise in visitors after the success of Wolf Hall. 'We are posting them out to people who cannot make it to Richmond but who would still like to sample them.' The Maids of Honour tart recipe remained a Court secret for 200 years until it was leaked by a palace cook to a John Billet, a baker in nearby Richmond, west London, in the mid-18th century, who then began producing the delicacies for wealthy customers. By 1850, John Newens, a former apprentice Billet's bakery, had opened his own baking business, bringing with him the secret recipe he had been taught. The original Maids of Honour recipe was passed down through the generations and the Maids of Honour tarts continue to be baked by Newens at their Kew tea shop to this day. The tarts have been deemed so intrinsic to the shaping of Tudor history that they even made it on to the menu of original Tudor dishes as part of Hampton Court's celebrations for the palace's 500th anniversary events this Easter. Maids of Honour tarts are baked using a 500-year-old recipe discovered in the 16th century by Henry VIII . Newens tea house original owner and staff. They started baking Maids of Honour tarts in 1850 . Managing director of Newens tea house, Dean Martin, poses with a 1938 Morris Minor  delivery van . Newens has already enjoyed a taste of fame when TV chef Jamie Oliver visited the Kew bakery last year as part of his Channel 4 Friday Night Feasts series, to see if modern methods could improve the 500-year-old recipe - the verdict was he couldn't. The bakery counts current royals, ex-prime ministers including Winston Churchill and even Hollywood greats such as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie among its more recent fans. Mr Martin said: 'We enjoyed a taste of fame last year when Jamie Oliver came to our bakery and tried to better the Maids of Honour recipe, and could not. 'However, apart from the fame these tarts give us, we're very much a local bakery manned seven days a week by local people who provide baked goods to the local community.'

The tarts have been deemed so intrinsic to the shaping of Tudor history they will be on the menu of original Tudor dishes as part of Hampton Court's celebrations for the palace's 500th anniversary events this Easter . The tea house is now bracing itself for a spike in visitors following the success of Wolf Hall. Mr Martin said: 'We're already doubling our production of Maids of Honour because we're expecting a big rise in visitors after the success of Wolf Hall. 'Ours are the original Maids of Honour tarts, baked using the exact recipe that drew Henry VIII to Anne Boleyn 500 years ago and we're honoured to be a part of an iconic relationship that changed the course of English history.'

"If you were to randomly shout out the name of an animal, it's likely outback adventurer Andrew Ucles has caught it. From snakes to  crocodiles and even sharks, the 26-year-old YouTube sensation from Wollongong, 60km of south of Sydney, has found his own unique way of snaring animals. Now, he has released a wacky video in which he uses venomous snakes to lure rabbits out of their burrows. Scroll down for video . Andrew Ucles has used snakes to capture rabbits . In the video, which has been viewed over nine million times since it was uploaded, Ucles showcases his distinctive capturing style, leading many to question his actions. Starting off his video, Ucles can be seen roaming around the outback with his top off, wearing only a pair of shorts and sneakers. ‘I know I’ve got a s*** haircut but I’m trying my best to blend into the natural surroundings,' Ucles says to the camera, marching his way through the bush. Realising that his bare hands may not be enough to catch the quick rabbits, Ucles goes on the hunt for some snakes to help him trap the furry creatures. He uses three red-bellied snakes and a tiger snake to catch the rabbits . Opening up into a swamp, Ucles searches all around him for snakes and it isn't long before he comes across his first one. ‘I don’t know how people can step on a snake, it’s so obvious,' he says to the camera, picking up a red-bellied black snake with one swift move. Seemingly unperturbed by the fact that red-bellied black snakes are highly poisonous, Ucles carries on his snake hunt,  grabbing two more red-bellied snakes by the tail, much to the reptiles' disgust. Wriggling around in his hands, Ucles takes the opportunity to tell viewers that the red-bellied snakes are as as quick as lightening and when held upside down they can reach their tail in a matter of seconds. He then drops one snake into each of the burrows and waits for the terrified rabbits to come running out . Trying to hush the two trapped snakes by whispering 'settle down', Ucles moves on, suddenly coming across one of the most dangerous snakes in the world - a tiger snake. Reaching behind the agitated tiger snake, Ucles picks it up by the tail, now holding three deadly venomous snakes in one hand and the fourth most dangerous snake in the other. Ucles explains that you have to pick your moments with snakes and it's all about the skill and tact. To ensure he captures some rabbits with his snake friends, Ucles makes sure he has strategically placed special nets over the tunnel of burrows. Not long after setting the slithering snakes on the animals, a rabbit shows his face, getting trapped in a net on his way out . He then drops one snake into each of the burrows and waits for the terrified rabbits to come running out. Not long after setting the slithering snakes on the animals, a rabbit shows his face, getting trapped in a net on his way out. Careful not to encounter a snake on its way out of the burrow, Ucles reaches down and frees the rabbit, delighted that he has proved his method works. He is quick to point out that no rabbits were hurt in the making of the video and the rabbit that was caught was released back into the wild. Ucles graduated with a Bachelor of Environmental Science and currently studying a Masters in Wildlife Management. Careful not to encounter a snake on its way out of the burrow, Ucles reaches down and frees the rabbit, delighted that he has proved his method works . He says he draws inspiration from wildlife lovers such as Bear Grylls and Steve Irwin and believes humans should interact with animals on a daily basis. According to his official website, he has been teaching himself how to capture some of Australia's most dangerous wildlife since he was seven-years-old. After school he would take mates into the bush and teach them how to catch capture animals. While he has been bitten many time by snakes, it has not deterred the young man from continuing to document his journey. He is expected to be the next big phenomenon, with his YouTube channel audience reaching over 45 million and it is rapidly climbing.","Andrew Ucles has used snakes to capture rabbits in his video .

"They were the two best friends who decided - after finding themselves single at the same time -  to date for 40 days to see what happened. But whatever happened to Jessica Walsh, 28, and Timothy Goodman, 34, whose story went viral in 2013 - did they find their happily ever after? Well, Jessica certainly did, only the bad news for Timothy is, it was with another man! Scroll down for video . Best friends Jessica Walsh and Timothy Goodman dated for 40 days in 2013. The pair blogged about their experience and wrote a book, 40 Days Of Dating which is out now . New York-based designers Jessica and Timothy decided to embark upon their 40 day experiment two years ago after finding themselves partner-less. The couple, who described themselves as complete opposites - she's the hopeless romantic and he's a charming lothario - would then share their experiences in a series of blogs. However, despite the fact that there was clearly some chemistry between the two and they even ended up sleeping together (on day 25) their relationship didn't work out. In fact just one month after their time together Jessica met her husband, cinematographer Zac Mulligan. But while she and Timothy might not have gone the distance some good did come out of their 40 days together. They have now turned their story into a book to be released this month named 40 Days Of Dating: The Experiment and it's already been optioned for a movie. Just a month after her 40 days was up  Jessica met cinematographer Zac Mulligan, who she went on to marry . Speaking of the experience, which both Jessica and Timothy have previously described as a positive one, Jessica said the pair had wanted to iron out their relationship issues. 'Tim was a commitment-phobe and I was a hopeless romantic,' Jessica told news.com.au. 'I had just gotten out of a relationship and was heartbroken. Tim had the exact opposite issue where he was dating five girls at once and couldn't commit. We were like, 'What's wrong with us? How can we fix this?' The couple decided to date for 40 days. As part of the agreement they'd  see each other every day and even take a weekend break together. They also decided that they wouldn't date anyone else while taking part. They now admit that they had definitely been attracted to one another and that their pals had been worried about what might happen to their friendship. Tim said: 'When we told our friends about it they were really against it, because we did have a great friendship and they were worried that we could ruin our friendship and end up hating each other. 'Now when we look back on it there was definitely a part of us that was attracted to each other, but we were too afraid to admit that to each other because we were such good friends.' And Jessica says the experiment changed her for the better and that her new husband - who happily allowed Tim to come to their wedding - doesn't mind that the two once dated. 'I learned to just be myself and not worry so much,' said Jessica. 'After the experiment I was in a really good mindset and just having fun with it all. 'I told him [her husband] about what Tim and I had done. At that point the blog wasn’t live yet. He’s a creative person too and he thought it was a really cool idea.' Tim is still single but says he's now a lot more 'open and vulnerable'.","Close pals Jessica Walsh and Timothy Goodman dated for 40 days .

"Triple police killer Harry Roberts enjoyed a champagne-fuelled birthday party and trips to a bowling alley and restaurant while on day release from prison. The murderer, who was jailed for life in 1966 for the murders of Geoffrey Fox, 41, Detective Sergeant Christopher Head, 30, and Detective Constable David Wombwell, 25, has been allowed periods of temporary release to reintegrate him with society. Roberts received a minimum term of 30 years and was released three months ago after serving 48 years behind bars. Scroll down for video . Triple police killer Harry Roberts, right, had enjoyed a champagne party while on temporary release from jail . Despite the heinous nature of his crime, for which he has never expressed any remorse, Roberts was allowed out on temporary release back in 2001. He was allowed to volunteer in an animal sanctuary in the East Midlands. At the time of his 65th birthday in July 2001, staff at the sanctuary arranged a secret birthday party and even arranged for a birthday cake and champagne. One source told The Mirror: 'Harry was in a good mood at the party. He wasn't aggressive or angry. He loved it. We had a slice of cake . He has a real sweet tooth and loves sugary treats like cake and chocolate. After that he got tipsy on champagne. 'At one point he raised his glass and said, ""Here's to freedom."" Then he goes, ""I cannot believe that the Home Secretary would let me out"".' He also received presents of aftershave and socks. Around that time he was also treated to a night out 10-pin bowling at the Hollywood Bowl centre in Chesterfield, Derbyshire. He joked with friends as they fooled around with an electric shock machine. The criminal had never been bowling before in his life, but enjoyed his trip telling friends he couldn't believe that the Home Secretary had let him out. There was also a trip to a restaurant when the killer sent back a steak meal, saying he'd waited 40 years for the dish so wanted it to be perfect. The murders were committed just six months after the abolition of hanging. Roberts went on the run for six months after the triple murder and was found hiding in a barn. Roberts was convicted of the murders of Geoffrey Fox, 41, left,  Detective Constable David Wombwell, centre, and Sergeant Christopher Head, right, in west London in 1966 - just six months after hanging was abolished . Roberts murdered the three plain-clothes policemen within sight of Wormwood Scrubs prison in West London, pictured . His trial judge described the crime as 'the most heinous in a generation'. Gillian Wombwell, 67, whose husband David was murdered by Roberts said she was disappointed by the ease with which the killer was able to serve his sentence. She said: 'As if it's not bad enough knowing he's free, these photos make me feel sickened and angry. He was hardly rotting away in his cell. He was sipping champagne and and enjoying 10-pin bowling. Is that the kind of punishment for a man who had killed three officers? These photos make me feel sickened and angry.' Roberts was jailed in 1966 for life for the murder of PC Geoffrey Fox, 41, Detective Sergeant Christopher Head, 30, and Detective Constable David Wombwell, 25. Following his release in November, it emerged that Roberts had earlier had a three-year long affair with a woman 27 years his junior, who claimed she broke his heart when she ended the relationship. The 78-year-old triple killer met the woman who eventually dumped him, while he was serving his  jail term. Roberts and the woman exchanged dozens of letters while the career criminal was in prison. He admitted that he wanted to move in with her whenever he was able to secure his release. The woman initially made contact with Roberts in 2010. When he responded, the killer claimed he wished he had never shot the three police officers as he would not have been in prison. Just one year before Roberts was eventually released, the woman told him it was over as she never expected that he would ever be free. According to the Sunday Mirror, the woman, who they called Susan, was incredibly nervous the first time she met Roberts at HMP Littlehey in Cambridgeshire. Susan claimed: 'Before I met him, I'd seen pictures of him on the internet, but when I met him he did look older than I imagined, but he didn't look like a really old man.' The 51-year-old woman said they had made plans to live together if Roberts was ever released from prison. She said that at the end of their prison visits, she was allowed to 'kiss and cuddle' Roberts. She said: We talked about going off together. The problem was he didn't have any knowledge of when he would get out. He was just fighting always to get out.' Susan admitted that she loved Roberts and believed that the feeling was mutual. She added: 'I only found out Harry was going to be released from the news. It was a strange feeling as I always thought I would be the first one there to congratulate him. But my life has gone in a different direction.'","Killer Harry Roberts was taken out for his 65th birthday and had cake .

"More than 40 countries will assist the U.S. in defeating ISIS, President Obama announced Thursday in a special national address. Mr Obama's speech follows the approval by Congress today, to arm Syrian rebels in the fight against the terrorist network. The president again insisted that no American troops will be sent back to Iraq to fight on the ground. Instead the U.S. will continue air strikes against ISIS, with new help from French allies. He said the country would not be bullied by the terrorist group, who have filmed the gruesome beheadings of two American journalists. 'Americans are united in confronting the threat from ISIL,' President Obama said from the White House. 'As Americans, we do not give in to fear.' Scroll down for video . Victory: President Obama addressed the nation Thursday evening, after receiving support from Congress to arm Syrian rebels in the fight against ISIS . The U.S. Senate approved the president's plan for training and arming moderate Syrian rebels to battle Islamic State militants today, a major part of his military campaign to 'degrade and destroy' the radical group. The Senate voted 78-22, in a rare bipartisan show of support for one of Mr Obama's high-profile initiatives. With the House of Representatives approving the legislation on Wednesday, the measure now goes to Obama to sign into law. Ten Senate Democrats and 12 Republicans voted no. Some objected to including a 'war vote' in a spending bill. The battle ahead: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel testified before the House Armed Services Committee today about the threat of ISIL . Others worried that getting involved with the rebels would lead to broader involvement in Iraq or Syria's civil war or that any arms given to them might fall into the wrong hands and end up being used against U.S. forces or their allies. 'We must now defend ourselves from these barbarous jihadists, but let's not compound the problem by arming feckless rebels in Syria who seem to be merely a pit stop for weapons that are really on their way to ISIS,' said Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, a leading Republican skeptic about foreign military involvement. 'ISIS' refers to the Islamic State in Syria. It is also referred to as ISIL and IS. Growing: The Islamic State has been gaining ground in parts of eastern Syria and northwestern Iraq, since the start of the Syrian civil war. ISIS jihadi-militants pictured above marching in the strong-hold city of Raqqa in January . Not doing it alone: In his speech Thursday night, President Obama said again that U.S. troops would not be fighting ISIS on the ground. Instead, we will continue airstrikes against the group in Iraq, with new help from the French military . The rebels have been fighting a three-year-long civil war seeking to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has held onto power despite the rise of the Islamic State group and a long covert U.S. effort to back the moderate fighters. The amendment to arm and train the rebels passed the House on a vote of 273-156, with support - and opposition - divided between Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Obama sought the authorization to have some congressional buy-in for his plan to stop the violent Islamic State militants, whose takeover of large parts of Iraq and Syria is seen as a threat to U.S. national security. The measure was written as an amendment to a spending bill that would keep the U.S. government operating on October 1, the start of a new fiscal year. If Obama signs it into law as expected, the authority to train and arm the rebels would expire on December 11. The legislation is likely just the start of a debate over what longer-term role the U.S. military should have in battling the Sunni Islamist militants who have killed thousands of people in Iraq and Syria, declared war on the West and are held responsible for beheading two American journalists in recent weeks. ISIS' most recent victim was a British aid worker David Haines, and the group released yet another video on Thursday showing a UK journalist pleading for his life. Next: ISIS released yet another video today, purporting to show a British photojournalist John Cantlie, pleading for his life .","President Obama held a press conference on Thursday, after Congress voted to arm rebels in Syria to fight ISIS .

"A teenage passenger who was in a car when a 17-year-old girl was shot and killed by Denver police has disputed authorities' account of her death, saying officers opened fire before one of them was struck by the vehicle. The passenger, speaking late Tuesday to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because of safety concerns, said her friend, Jessica Hernandez, lost control of the vehicle because she was unconscious after being shot. Police have said the Monday morning shooting in a residential alley came after Hernandez drove a stolen vehicle into one of them. Scroll down for video . Teenager: 17-year-old Jessica Hernandez, pictured, was shot and killed earlier on Monday. Police have said the  shooting in a residential alley came after Hernandez drove a stolen vehicle into one of them . Vigil: Candles burn in front of participants at a vigil near the scene of the shooting that killed Jessica Hernandez on Monday January 26, in northeast Denver . Anger: Jose Castaneda, front, who lost his cousin in a Denver Police shooting early Monday, is led away by activist Anthony Grimes from a meeting with officials from the office of the Denver District Attorney . Prosecutors on Tuesday promised a thorough probe of the shooting as a small group of angry protesters demanded swift answers and called for a special prosecutor to investigate the death. The shooting occurred amid a national debate about police use of force fueled by racially charged episodes in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City. It was also the fourth time in seven months that a Denver police officer fired into a moving vehicle after perceiving it as a threat, and the city's independent police monitor now says he will investigate the department's policies and practices related to shooting at moving vehicles, which he said poses unique safety risks. Police spokesman Sonny Jackson offered no new details about the case on Tuesday, citing the department's open investigation. The shooting happened after an officer was called to check on a suspicious vehicle, Chief Robert White has said. A colleague arrived after the officer determined the car had been reported stolen. Police have said the two officers approached the car on foot when Hernandez drove into one of them, and they both then opened fire. Demonstration: Protesters wave placards on Tuesday in Denver . Public protest: Nazzi McDonnell, left, of Colorado Springs, Colorado, joins other participants in waving placards at the Monday night vigil for Jessica Hernandez . The car's passenger said police had surrounded the car in the alley, and Hernandez was trying to flee, attempting to drive around one of the squad cars. The officers came up to the car from behind and fired four times into the driver's side window as they stood on the side of the car, narrowly missing others inside, the passenger said. Hernandez wrecked the car into a fence after she was shot, according to the witness. Police said the officer suffered a leg injury for which he was treated at a hospital and released. Officers with their guns drawn then pulled people out of the car, including Hernandez, who they handcuffed and searched. The passenger was unaware the vehicle was stolen and provided only vague details about what the group of teenagers was doing earlier in the night. Both officers involved in the shooting have been placed on routine administrative leave pending the investigation. 'We're angry about it. It's another life taken by another cop,' said 19-year-old Cynthia Valdez, a close friend and schoolmate of the girl. 'She was trying to find her talent. She wanted to find out what she wanted to be. ... Who knows what she could have been?' Few details were immediately released after the shooting in an alley in the older, middle-class residential neighborhood. The four other people - three girls and a boy - in the car were not injured by the gunfire, and all were being questioned as part of the investigation, police said. It was not clear whether any had been arrested. Police Chief Robert White said an officer was called to check on a suspicious vehicle at around 6.30am Monday in the Park Hill section of Denver and a colleague arrived after it was determined the car had been reported stolen. In a statement, police said the two officers then 'approached the vehicle on foot when the driver drove the car into one of the officers.' White said both officers then opened fire. The officer hit by the car was taken to a hospital with a leg injury. Bobbie Diaz, whose 17-year-old daughter was in the car, said she was lying in bed when she heard four gunshots followed by an officer yelling, 'Freeze! Get out of the car! Get down!' Diaz said she came outside to see officers with their guns drawn pulling people out of the car, including Jessica. 'She seemed like she was not responding, not moving,' she said. 'They just yanked her out and handcuffed her.' Meanwhile, Diaz said she heard another person screaming, 'She's dead! She's dead!' 'I'm just trying to process everything. I'm just heartbroken for the girl's family,' Diaz said. 'How could something like this happen again?'

Patrick Demmer, left, and Anthony Grimes lsten before heading into the meeting . Prosecutors: Doug Jackson, center, and Lamar Sims, right, senior chief deputy district attorneys with the office of the Denver District Attorney, talk to Jose Castaneda, left, and other activists on Tuesday . Another woman, Arellia Hammock, who has lived in the neighborhood for about a decade, said she heard three gunshots about 6.30am and then saw several police cars streaming down the street. Hammock said she understands one of the officers was injured, but 'that's still no reason to shoot.' 'They shouldn't have stolen a car. But the cops are too fast on the gun,' she said. 'You've got stun guns. You've got rubber bullets. Why do they have to shoot all the time?' That sentiment was echoed during the vigil for Hernandez as some held signs decrying police brutality. One of the signs read, 'Girls' Lives Matter,' a play on the 'Black Lives Matter' slogan that became a rallying cry after the police killings of unarmed black men in Ferguson, Missouri and New York City. 'It should have been handled differently. She's a young girl. I'm just not OK with it,' said 17-year-old Destiny Moya, who grew up with Jessica. Prosecutors promised a thorough investigation  and asked angry protesters gathered outside District Attorney Mitch Morrissey's office for patience. Morrissey wasn't there during the tense confrontation at his office, where chief deputy district attorneys Doug Jackson and Lamar Sims spoke over shouts and obscenities from some of the protesters. Jackson said he could not discuss the facts of the case but assured the group that the findings of the investigation will be made public when it's finished. 'You can decide whether we made the right decision or not,' Jackson said. The girl's cousin, Jose Castaneda, said he was frustrated and didn't want to wait months to find out what happened. 'Let me ask you one question, how would you feel if it was your kid?' he yelled before storming away. Protesters said they don't trust Morrissey's office to handle the case because the last time a Denver police officer faced charges in a shooting was 1992. 'We are sick and tired of these kinds of things happening and there seems to be no true objective investigation,' said the Rev. Patrick Demmer of the Greater Metro Denver Ministerial Alliance. A shrine of red and white flowers and candles, and a grinning white teddy bear marked the shooting scene Tuesday. Magaly Castaneda, 17, a friend of Hernandez, visited the site and said she doubted Hernandez would have intentionally hit an officer. 'She didn't even get time to think that she was going to get shot,' Castaneda said. She had known Hernandez since both were middle school students doing each other's hair and makeup. Castaneda said Hernandez would bring home friends who had nowhere else to go, sometimes exasperating her mother. 'She always had a heart. She always cared about everyone,' Castaneda said.

"Glamorous in a tailored grey suit and beige silk shirt, Spain's Queen Letizia was every inch the professional as she toured a tourism fair - even when confronted by a man in fancy dress. The Spanish royal, 42, was visiting the FITUR International Tourism Fair in Madrid when a well-wisher in a grey robe approached, brandishing a map. Ever composed, Letizia and husband King Felipe, who celebrates his 47th birthday on Friday, smiled broadly at the man before inspecting the map and moving on. Scroll down for video . Interesting choice! A well-wisher in fancy dress approached the Spanish royals during a visit in Madrid . Today's visit is the latest in a busy week for the Spanish royal couple, with Letizia yesterday attending the board meeting of FEDER, the Spanish Federation of Rare Diseases. Despite the serious subject matter, the royal appeared to enjoy the event and smiled happily at waiting photographers as she left. The meeting with FEDER was a bit of a departure for Letizia who, until now, has focused her efforts on championing Spanish culture and the plight of disabled people, although latterly, health has become something of a preoccupation. Last week, she compered a meeting of the Spanish Association Against Cancer, an organisation of which she is president. All smiles: Letizia appeared to be on top form as she toured the tourism event and met well-wishers . Sharp: The Spanish queen was glamorous in a sharply tailored suit and neat beige silk shirt . Come to Spain: Felipe made a speech at the event, which hopes to showcase the many beauties of Spain . A day later and she was back on the cultural beat, joining husband King Felipe for the opening of a museum in Pamplona. During the couple's tour of Museum of the University of Navarra, they were shown a contemporary art exhibition which included pieces by a number of Spanish greats, among them Pablo Picasso. Letizia's latest meeting comes shortly after the Spanish royal family was left reeling by news that a woman claiming to be the love child of former king Juan Carlos has come forward. Ingrid Sartiau, 47, has been given the green light to take her battle for recognition by the royals forward to the Spanish Supreme Court - if she can prove her story is true. Listening in: Letizia stood proudly at the edge of the stage as Felipe made his speech . Busy: The Spanish royals have had a busy week so far with plenty of engagements scheduled in . Low key: Spain's Queen Letizia arrives on foot for the board meeting of FEDER in Madrid yesterday morning . No car: She was without a car or flunkies and was accompanied by a single bodyguard . According to Ms Sartiau, she is the product of a three-night liaison between her mother Liliane, a Belgian governess, and the now 76-year-old royal in 1966. Although by then a married 28-year-old father of two, an affair would hardly have been out of character for Juan-Carlos. Throughout his marriage 'Don Juan' is said to have bedded some 1,500 women, including an alleged affair with Princess Diana while on a cruise with their spouses in August 1986. Ms Sartiau herself had no idea of the identity of her father for more than 40 years, only being told his name in 2011. Although Spanish courts rejected her paternity claims twice on the grounds that a monarch could not be subjected to such tests, Juan-Carlos' abdication last year has paved the way for a new attempt. Concerned: Letizia has been championing an increasing number of health related causes in recent weeks .

"Three women were injured on Tuesday after bricks from an a nearby building came crashing through the roof of a women's athletic store that they were shopping in. The women were all rescued from the Lululemon Athletica store on the 1500 block of Walnut Street in Philadelphia, according to police Sergeant Eric Gripp. They were taken to hospital but did not have life-threatening injuries after the freak accident which  occurred just before 3:30 p.m. Victim: Allison Friedman, pictured left and right,  was named as one of the victims. Her father Howard Edelman told NBC10 his daughter was shopping inside the store with two friends at the time of the accident . Rescue: Firefighters rushed to the scene to assess the damage and took victims out of the store on stretchers . Hospital: The emergency workers took the victims to nearby Hahnemann University Hospital but all have been released . Firefighters rushed to the scene to assess the damage. Eyewitnesses said two of the women had head injuries but managed to free themselves while another was stuck under the debris. Rescue workers took all three victims out of the store on stretchers to nearby Hahnemann University Hospital. NBC News has named Allison Friedman as one of the victims. Her father Howard Edelman told NBC10 his daughter was shopping inside the store with two friends at the time of the accident. 'The toughest part is that it's your kid. 'No matter how old. She said all of a sudden they heard rumbling and the next thing you know, she was at the bottom, buried.' Friedman, a newlywed and local teacher is recovering at home. While she's in pain, her father is happy she made it out alive. 'It couldve been a lot worse,' he said. 'We're very, very lucky. She will be fine.' Store: The incident occurred just before 3:30 p.m. at the Lululemon Athletica store located on Walnut Street . View: An aerial photograph showed a large hole in the roof and bricks missing from the  building . All three victims, including Edelmman, were released from the hospital on Tuesday evening. According to inspectors, the bricks which caused the 20-foot wide hole in Lululemon's roof were from a penthouse elevator shaft at 1529 Walnut - which is next door to the store. An aerial photograph showed a large hole in the roof and bricks missing from the roof of a six-story office building next door. A photo posted online showed broken-off wooden beams jutting into the store from above. The bricks which caused the 20-foot wide hole in Lululemon's roof were from a penthouse elevator shaft at 1529 Walnut - which is next door to the store . Building: These images show a gaping hole in the roof of the building where the collapse occurred at Lululemon . An eyewitness described the scene to ABC 6 News: 'It shook, it shook. It was intense, very intense.' Lulemon Customer Christine Vamvalis-Haley added: 'The lighting, the whole ceiling and the roof and the sidewall, everything just came crashing down.' The adjacent building only has one tenant - a law firm. Attorney, Louis Bove, who works for the firm, said he was  working on the top floor of the adjacent building, when he heard 'a really loud crash that shook my desk.' Then he looked out and saw the hole in Lululemon's roof and bricks scattered nearby. But he described the landlord of his building as 'great.' Shock: An eyewitness described the scene to ABC 6 News : 'It shook, it shook. It was intense, very intense' City records show that the landlord has no history of maintenance violations, and has already taken full responsibility for the accident at the athletic store.

A series of gruesome videos of damaged lungs have recently been released as part of a Chinese anti-smoking campaign . The videos, which were shared through chinaSMACK on Friday, show the grave effects of tobacco smoke. The caption for the footage reads: 'Over 80 per cent of lung cancer cases are believed to be caused by long-term smoking or ""second hand smoke""!' 'In the images, the lung of someone who has smoked for 15 years is covered with large black spots, while the lung of a 30-year smoker is even more of a ghastly sight, where even the inside is covered with cancer causing substances.' China is believed to be the world's largest producer and consumer of tobacco products, according to the World Health Organisation.

"Gillian Taylforth, who is best known for her role as Kathy Beale on EastEnders, has taken matters into her own hands as she approaches her 60th birthday. The 59-year-old, who also appeared on Footballer's Wives and The Bill, has turned back time with a non-surgical facelift called the Silhouette Soft. The star was treated by Dr Aamer Khan at the Harley Street Skin Clinic - and she's now the face of the anti-ageing procedure, which uses dissolvable thread to remove wrinkles. Scroll down for video . Before and after: Actress Gillian Taylforth, 59, has undergone a Silhouette Soft - a 'non-surgical face lift' that uses a dissolvable thread to remove wrinkles . During the procedure, which costs around £1,500 and takes about half an hour, a thread made of polylactic acid is drawn through the skin after injections of local anesthetic. The thread is used to give a tailor-made result, lifting specific parts of the face. This acid is completely biodegradable and acts on the deeper layers of the skin and naturally stimulates the body so that it produces its own collagen. This action, which continues over time, apparently helps increase the volume of saggy areas and restore shapeliness to the face gradually and naturally. Gillian shows off the results of the new anti-ageing procedure, which she had ahead of her milestone birthday . During the procedure, which costs around £1,500 and takes around half an hour, a thread made of polylactic acid is drawn through the skin after injections of local anesthetic . The acid in the thread is completely biodegradable and acts on the deeper layers of the skin and naturally stimulates the body so that it produces its own collagen, say cosmetic surgeons . The thread dissolves completely after 18 months and promises to have an immediate lift and lasting regenerative effect. Speaking about the treatment, Dr Khan said: 'I recommend it to redefine the faces of patients looking for ways to combat sagging jowls and loss of volume in the cheek area - but who don’t want surgery. 'It produces an extremely natural-looking result which leaves the face completely mobile - very important in Gillian’s case as she is an actress. She is also a very animated woman who laughs and smiles all the time, so it was imperative that she could continue to emote.' Gillian has had a successful screen career, which has included stints on ITV's Loose Women, Strictly Come Dancing and Celebrity Big Brother. Her most recent role saw her playing Sandy Roscoe on Channel 4 soap opera Hollyoaks. Gillian and Dr. Aamer Khan pictured at the Silhouette Soft launch at the Harley Street Skin Clinic, London .

"Hester Mottershead, 90, died from a stroke after a four-man gang ransacked her home in Wolverhampton - but noone was tried for her death . Serious questions have been raised over why a gipsy gang which ransacked the country home of a retired headmistresses minutes before she died from a stroke have not been prosecuted over her death. Hester Mottershead, 90, had frantically phoned 999 after four burglars dressed in blue boiler suits turned up at her £550,000 detached home in Tettenhall, Wolverhampton, claiming to be water board officials. An inquest into Miss Mottershead's death heard how one of the men pretended to inspect her taps, as three others turned over her property, before fleeing with a haul of valuables. But by the time officers arrived after the incident in August 2012, the elderly woman had collapsed and was rushed to hospital, where she died 24 hours later. Police launched a murder inquiry and a string of specialists said the stroke was extremely likely to have been caused by the stress of the raid. But, one year later, manslaughter charges against the four men were dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service, due to an alleged lack of medical evidence. Instead, the gang - who lived on caravan sites in Warwickshire and Leicestershire - were jailed for burglary. Black Country senior coroner Zafar Siddique has now questioned why the CPS dropped the charges relating to the 'absolute tragedy' of Miss Mottershead's death. Speaking at Sandwell Coroners' Court on Tuesday at the inquest, Mr Siddique said he believed the actions of the gang had caused Miss Mottershead's fatal stroke 'on the balance of probability'. Recording a narrative conclusion, he added: 'It's been suggested that cerebral haemorrhage may be triggered by acute stress response. 'However the scientific evidence cannot exclude the possibility that this was coincidental. On the balance of probability I would suggest it has been a contributing factor. 'I do share the disappointment with the officers about the charges that weren't pursued.' Mrs Mottershead's second cousin Peter also said he was 'disgusted' that the criminals had not been further pursued. Detective Chief Inspector Caroline Marsh, from West Midlands Police, had told the hearing how the CPS did not believe it could be proven beyond doubt the men were responsible for the death. The culprits were William Connors, 20, James Connors, 22, Gerry Connors, 20, and Michael Cash, 23. She said: 'I believe we reached that threshold but we have to leave the decision to the CPS. It was their view and the view of counsel that the standard wasn't met. 'We were unable to get the authority to charge with manslaughter. The gang posed as water board officials before carrying out the  burglary. Miss Mottershead (pictured left and right in a 1974 school photo) graduated from Oxford University and taught at Bilston High School for Girls . Although Miss Mottershead (left) lived alone, she bought and shared the £550,000 property with her friend and former Bilston deputy head Brenda Thompson (right) until Miss Thompson’s death in 2006 . 'That was because, in the view of the CPS, our medical evidence wasn't strong enough for a causal link to be established.' But a range of different specialists, including the pathologist who carried out Miss Mottershead's post-mortem examination, concluded the stroke was extremely likely to have been brought on as a result of increased stress levels and blood pressure, in turn caused by the raid. After the hearing, the victim's 57-year-old cousin Peter Mottershead said he was 'disgusted' at the decision not to charge the men. The warehouse worker, from Alveley, Shropshire, said: 'The sentences were miniscule. They could be doing it again.' The inquest also heard how the four men were among eight defendants who were sentenced for a string of raids carried out across the Midlands on the same day Miss Mottershead was targeted. An inquest into Miss Mottershead's death heard how one of the men inside pretended to inspect her taps, before three others turned over her property (pictured), before fleeing with a haul of valuables . Elderly residents had been threatened with cricket bats and hockey sticks which had been stolen from previous raids, the hearing heard. Detective Chief Inspector Marsh said there was breakthrough in the case when officers linked up 12 separate incidents through the presence of a distinctive Audi. She added: 'All four suspects I have mentioned today were found guilty or pleaded to the offences conspiracy to burgle and rob. 'All have been sentenced by Wolverhampton Court to sentences ranging between two to five years, which we were disappointed with.' Miss Mottershead was born in Lancashire and educated at St Anne’s College, Oxford, where she qualified with a first-class degree before training as a teacher. Police launched a murder inquiry after the incident, but manslaughter charges brought against the four men were dropped one year later. Pictured: The scene of the crime in August 2012 . She became headmistress of Bilston Girls’ High School in 1954, where she also taught Latin, until it was converted into a sixth form centre in 1975. The building has since been converted into flats. In 1976 she became principal of Wolverhampton Girls’ High School, where former pupils remember her taking her pet corgi Iola into school with her. She retired in 1983. Although Miss Mottershead lived alone, she bought and shared the £550,000 property with her friend and former Bilston deputy head Brenda Thompson, until Miss Thompson’s death in 2006. In her will, she left £50,000 to Oxford University and £20,000 to New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton. Large sums were also donated to local schools and charities including the RNLI and the Dogs' Trust. Mr Mottershead's mother Hazel, 89, said her late cousin 'was school, school, school' and had studied hard to win scholarships in her younger days.","Gang told 90-year-old Hester Mottershead they were water board officials .

"A Florida woman originally sentenced to 20 years behind bars for firing a warning shot to scare off her abusive husband and two stepsons, has been released from jail to spend the remainder of her two year sentence on house arrest. Mother-of-three Marissa Alexander, 34, had claimed self-defense in her originally trial and her tough sentence was highlighted a year later as an example of the unfairness of Florida's Stand Your Ground law after George Zimmerman was acquitted of murdering Trayvon Martin in 2013. On Tuesday Alexander was sentenced to the 1,095 days she has already served in jail after pleading guilty to three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon as part of a plea agreement for the 2010 shooting. Scroll down for video . Free at last: Marissa Alexander walks by her dad Raoul Jenkins and is surrounded by her legal team and supporters after her sentencing in Jacksonville, Florida on Tuesday . She also received two years of house arrest. Applause erupted in the courtroom and once she was outside of the courthouse, Alexander read the following statement: 'Today, after the sentence given by Judge Daniel, my family and I will be able to move on with our lives. 'Although the journey has been long and there's been many difficult moments, I could not have arrived here, where I am today, without the thoughts, many thoughts and many prayers of so many people who voiced their support and encouragement. 'Words can never express my gratitude for those who stood beside me, including my children and family. I am also grateful that Judge Daniel approached this case with such care and diligence.' The 34-year-old had faced 60 years if convicted at trial because of Florida's minimum-mandatory-sentencing law pertaining to firearm use. The jury at her first trial found her guilty after deliberating for just 12 minutes. The verdict was thrown out after a judge ruled the trial court incorrectly required Alexander to prove she was abused by her husband. Marissa Alexander, pictured in court on Tuesday, had claimed self-defense after prosecutors say she fired a gun at her estranged husband and his two sons, has been released from prison as part of a plea agreement for time served . Although no one was injured in Alexander's case, the court gave her a 20-year prison sentence in 2012 under the state's mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines because she had fired a gun during the assault . For the next two years Alexander must wear a GPS ankle monitor and will only be allowed to leave her home to go to work, job interviews, church, family medical and dental appointments, and to visit her children's schools. She'll have to get a judge's permission to do anything else. 'It's hard to get a job, it's hard to get housing, it's hard to qualify for anything. Her life has been destroyed for this,' supporter Denise Hunt told News4JAX. Alexander’s case had drawn criticism from civil rights groups concerned about self-defense laws and mandatory minimum sentencing rules, but it received little attention outside north Florida until the Zimmerman case. Although no one was injured in Alexander's case, the court gave her a 20-year prison sentence under the state's mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines because she had fired a gun during the assault. A state appeals court ruled in September that Alexander, who is black, deserved a new trial because the judge failed to properly instruct the Jacksonville, Florida jury about her self-defense argument. She was convicted in May 2012. Marissa Alexander's tough sentence was highlighted as an example of the unfairness of Florida's Stand Your Ground law after George Zimmerman, right, was acquitted of murdering Trayvon Martin, left, in 2013 . Zimmerman was arrested for killing Trayvon Martin in 2012 and was acquitted of murder and manslaughter in July 2013. Under the so-called Stand Your Ground clause which was added to Florida's self-defense law in 2005, people who use deadly force to defend themselves from serious injury - rather than retreating to avoid confrontation - can be immune from prosecution. Zimmerman never sought immunity under Stand Your Ground, instead relying on a standard self-defense law. Alexander, who had never been arrested before, said she fired a bullet to scare off her husband when she felt he was threatening her. No one was hurt, but the judge in the case said he was bound by state law to sentence her to 20 years in prison after she was convicted of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Alexander's Stand Your Ground claim was rejected because she left the house during the confrontation to retrieve a gun from her car, returning to fire a shot near her husband Rico Gray's head. Alexander and abusive husband Rico Gray had a daughter together who is now 4-years-old, right, while she also has two teenage children as well . For the next two years Alexander must wear a GPS ankle monitor and will only be allowed to leave her home to go to work, job interviews, church, family medical and dental appointments, and to visit her children's schools . A slightly built woman who stands 5 feet 2 inches, Alexander said her 245-pound husband was about to attack her when she fired into a kitchen wall during the August 2010 incident. He had previously been convicted of domestic violence for attacking her. Prosecutors said the shot endangered Gray. At the time, Alexander had an active restraining order against her husband and she carried a concealed weapons permit. State Attorney Angela Corey, who oversaw the prosecution of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, has stood by the handling of Alexander's case. Corey said she believes that Alexander aimed the gun at the man and his two sons, and that the bullet she fired could have ricocheted and hit any of them. 'I look forward to the full-time challenge of getting my two teenagers through high school and into college, as well we preparing my 4-year-old daughter for nursery school. My goal is to continue my education beyond my master's degree and to continue my professional career,' said Alexander in her statement following Tuesday's release. 'Also, I will continue to learn lessons from the events of the past, but I will not live in the past. At the age of 34, life is too short and there's too much I have to accomplish in the years ahead. It's my hope and prayer that everyone associated with this case will be able to move on with their lives.' Alexander said she was now looking forward to the full-time challenge of getting her two teenagers through high school and into college, as well we preparing her 4-year-old daughter for nursery school .","Mother-of-three Marissa Alexander was free to walk out of court on Tuesday after receiving two years house arrest as part of a plea deal .

"A war veteran who vanished from his care home to attend the 70th anniversary D-Day commemorations in France has left his  £600,000 estate to lifeboat charity the RNLI. Bernard Jordan – nicknamed the Great Escaper after his cross-Channel adventure last year – died peacefully in hospital aged 90 on December 30. Mr Jordan hit the headlines last summer when he travelled to the 70th anniversary D-Day events in Normandy wearing his war medals and grey mac. He slipped out of The Pines care home in Hove, East Sussex, telling carers he was going for a walk – but in reality he hopped on a ferry to France. Scroll down for video . Hero: Bernard Jordan, the 90-year-old war veteran who broke out of his care home in East Sussex to attend the D-Day commemorations in Normandy, pictrured with new friend in France, has left £600,000 to the RNLI . Loss: Irene Jordan (pictured with Bernard), 88, died a week after  the death of her husband and the details of their will have been revealed . Second World War veteran Mr Jordan, a former Royal Navy member and ex-mayor of Hove, said on his return that his aim was to remember his fallen ‘mates’. His wife Irene, who was in the same care home, died seven days after her husband, aged 88, and today it emerged the couple's entire estate has been left to ensure lives are saved at sea. In love: Mr Jordan, pictured on their wedding day in 1946, said when he fled his care home:  ‘I didn’t want to make a fuss. I squeezed her hand and gave her a kiss' RNLI chief executive Paul Boissier today praised Mr Jordan's spirit, which he said is shared by the volunteers who risk their lives to save people lost at sea all around the coasts of the UK every day. He said: 'This is absolutely wonderful, unexpected news. 'Bernard's story charmed the nation last year when he journeyed from his Sussex care home to France to commemorate the D-Day landings. 'That spirit, that determination, is embedded deep within the psyche of our volunteer lifeboat crews who go to sea to save others in peril on the sea. 'I am delighted that the couple chose to leave us this sizeable donation, and their contribution, like those of Bernard's veteran peers, will never be forgotten.' An RNLI spokesman said the legacy came as a 'huge surprise' but believed the couple's admiration stemmed from Mr Jordan's time in the Royal Navy in the Second World War. Guy Rose, the legal admin manager for the RNLI, said: 'This is a wonderful gift from Bernard and Irene. 'He really made a name for himself last year and there can't be many who weren't touched by his story. 'Gifts left in wills are so valuable to the RNLI and they ensure we can continue our life-saving work for people in, on or near the water.' Journey: Mr Jordan (centre) pictured onboard a ferry to France with a cabin crew and members of the Candy Girls entertainment troupe. Staff described him as a 'charmer' and said he had been a hit with the ladies . Found: Veteran Bernard Jordan has been found in Normandy after travelling to France to mark the anniversary of D-Day. Above, the 89-year-old is pictured now (left) and during his time as a member of the Royal Navy (right) A ceremony celebrating Mr and Mrs Jordan’s lives will be held at All Saints Church in Hove on January 30 followed by a private funeral. A minute’s silence will be held at the next full meeting of Brighton and Hove City Council to remember the couple. Mr Jordan had, in past interviews, referred to his wife as a ‘smashing woman’. Mr Jordan’s disappearance sparked a police search last June 5 and his whereabouts emerged only when a younger veteran phoned later that night to say he had met Mr Jordan and he was safe. He described how he kept his exploit secret from his wife. On the morning he left, he dressed and put on his medals, making sure to hide them under his blue mac before he said goodbye to Irene. ‘I didn’t want to make a fuss,’ he said at the time. ‘I squeezed her hand and gave her a kiss. 'I told her, “You’ll miss me for a bit, but I’ll be back shortly.” Then I went downstairs and told the care home staff I was going out. I gave them a wave and just walked out.’ Hero's welcome: He sparked a nationwide search after escaping from his care home and sneaking to France for the Normandy commemorations. He was later applauded for his escapade . Final journey: Mr Jordan had hoped to return to Normandy this year and Brittany Ferries, which carried him across the Channel last summer, offered him free crossings to D-Day events for the rest of his life . He had decided to join British veterans, most making their final pilgrimage to revisit the scene of their momentous invasion, to remember the heroes of the liberation of Europe. Some 156,000 Allied troops landed on the five invasion beaches on June 6 1944, sparking an 80-day campaign to liberate Normandy involving three million troops and costing 250,000 lives. Mr Jordan had hoped to return to Normandy this June. Brittany Ferries, which carried him across the Channel last summer, offered him free crossings to D-Day events for the rest of his life after learning of his exploits. Following his death, the Royal British Legion said Mr Jordan’s decision to go to France highlighted ‘the spirit that epitomises the Second World War generation’. On his 90th birthday, days after he returned from his escapade, he was inundated with more than 2,500 birthday cards from around the world.","Veteran Bernard Jordan, 90, died seven days before his beloved wife Irene .

"With her hand resting on her growing baby bump and her face betraying the strain of her impending murder trial, the pregnant US teenager accused of murdering her socialite mother was back in court in Bali today. Heather Mack, 19, and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, negotiated a media scrum as they arrived at for their latest hearing in Denpasar on the Indonesian island. The pair, both from Chicago in the US, are accused of killing Sheila von Wiese-Mack and stuffing her body in a suitcase. They face a firing squad if they are found guilty. Scroll down for video . Heather Mack looks pensive as she cups her baby bulge while waiting for proceedings to start . Mack shields herself from the cameras. She could wait up to two years in prison before the case finishes . The caged pair talk through bars with friends before their court appearance in the southern Balinese town . Seven-months pregnant Heather's baby bump was clearly visible as she sat pensively waiting in the courtroom for proceedings to commence. Dressed in matching orange prison vests and white shirts, Mack and Schaefer were handcuffed to each other as they arrived at court. The pair were sent to the island's notorious Kerobokan Prison in December ahead of today's appearance . They were arrested in August following the gruesome discovery of the badly beaten body of Mack's 62-year-old mother stuffed inside a suitcase that had been loaded into a taxi outside the luxury St Regis Hotel in Nusa Dua. The accused are being tried separately with the same judges and prosecuting teams at the Denpasar District Court. Prosecutors charged them with premeditated murder, which carries a maximum penalty of death. The couple's lawyers said last week that the prosecutors' indictment contained inaccuracies that could lead to multiple interpretations of the suspects' activities and the crime scene, raising questions of whether other people had entered the victim's room and killed her. Lawyers for Mack claim the killing was not premeditated and that she hid in the bathroom while her mother was bludgeoned to death in her hotel room. They also object to the citing of communications between the defendants on cellphones as evidence of premeditated murder, arguing that cellphone communications are prone to manipulation. Based on these arguments, they asked the judges to annul the indictment. But in their response today, state prosecutors told the court that their case is fully qualified according to the law. 'Our indictment as well as charges are very clear,' said chief prosecutor Eddy Arta Wijaya. 'Let's prove it through witnesses' testimonies and evidences in the next hearings.' In their indictment, prosecutors said the couple plotted the murder because von Wiese-Mack did not endorse their relationship and that Mack once suggested that Schaefer hire someone to kill her mother for $50,000 before their visit to Bali. Mack puts on a prison vest while guards keep a close watch before she heads for the courtroom . The young couple walk to a prisoner car at Kerobokan prison in Denpasar on the resort island . The lovers were handcuffed together while the cameras rolled as they made there way to court . There is intense media interest in the case, as the packed rows of photographers and cameramen show . Schaefer, who is also from Chicago, is handcuffed by an Indonesian prison guard . It said that an argument over the hotel bill made Mack's mother angry and she scolded Schaefer, using a racial slur. Schaefer is black, as was Mack's father, James L. Mack, a highly-regarded jazz and classical composer who died in 2006. Schaefer is accused of battering von Wiese-Mack with the iron grip of a fruit bowl. Security camera footage showed the victim earlier having an argument with him in the hotel lobby. Mack, who is seven months' pregnant, helped stuff her mother's body in the suitcase by sitting on it to enable Schaefer to close it, the indictment said. They then hired a taxi and placed the suitcase in the trunk and told the driver they were going to check out of the hotel and would return, but never did. Presiding Judge Made Suweda postponed the trial until Monday where the judge panel would decide whether or not to proceed. Mack will continue to be under medical observation while in Kerobokan Prison because she is pregnant and due to give birth at the beginning of April. She has pledged to keep her baby daughter with her in prison when she is born, despite sharing a cell with six other female inmates. Mack has already named her unborn child Stella after a family member, according to the baby's lawyer, Vanessa Favia. She is due to give birth on April 1. Mack is expected to remain behind bars for at least two years while her case proceeds through the Indonesian legal system - assuming she is not freed before then.

But finding a seat alongside the tech-heads in Silicon Valley is just the tip of the iceberg for young Ben, as he revealed to Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday. He's had discussions with venture capitalists in San Francisco keen to bankroll his new venture to the tune of 'well, if I got to keep the money I could buy two new Ferraris'. Scroll down for video . He's the Aussie whiz-kid who famously came up with one of the world's most popular Apps while 'bored at school'. Ben Pasternak has just come back from visiting the biggest social media hubs in the US and is now weighing up investment offers of up to half a million dollars for his next big idea . Ben Pasternak tells how he had discussions with venture capitalists in San Francisco keen to bankroll his new venture to the tune of 'well, if I got to keep the money I could buy two new Ferraris' Thumbs up. The 15-year-old has been wowed by visits to the likes of Facebook and is very keen on cracking it for a much sought-after internship at the social networking hub's office . As to what his latest brainwave might be, it was met with the classic line, 'can't say much but what I can say' response. 'Basically I am trying to make instant messaging more personal and in the moment,' he added. 'My new year's resolution was to make last year look like a warm-up.' And with some estimates that the first App he developed is nudging 800,000 downloads, that's saying something. 'Sure I would be interested at interning at Facebook but I don't plan to work for them, I want to start my own. I haven't got much to say on that but I am looking to start my own thing.' The success of Impossible Rush, which he enlisted the help of his mate Austin in Chicago for and then sold the rights to it for just $200, created this huge wave of interest he is riding. His recent American sojourn landed him in the offices of Facebook, Apple, Instagram and Google - so busy was he, that he didn't get to take up an invitation from Yahoo. This magnificent obsession all began with a fascination, at age eight, for the on-line Disney game, Club Penguin. Ben Pasternak (far right) was in rare company at the 'Hackathon', just one of 20 students from outside the United States to be invited to attend the event which attracted 450 of the brightest tech minds and challenged them to come up with an exciting product within just 36 hours . Like many others, Mark Zuckerberg is someone the Aussie schoolboy looks up to and said just walking past his office to see him locked in top-level meetings was 'surreal' Now the Year 10 Reddam House School (Woollahra) student is meeting with like-minded teens at what he insists is he next big thing - Hackathons. 'It's (a competition) where you get teams of 2 to 5 people and all teams have 36 hours to make a hardware product, website or a new app,' he said. 'There are several judges usually presidents of large companies like Facebook and Google. 'They are fun and they are really changing everything we thought about tech, we can make great products in a short amount of time.'

'100 per cent, I definitely think there's not anyone out there who is my age in Australia who has the same ambitions as me, and I don't look at what is happening here in Australia too much because I would probably know already if there was something that interested me,' he said. 'I can't blame Australia because Silicon Valley is where it is at, I am definitely looking to move, maybe even if in the next few months.' He exudes confidence but that doesn't mean he doesn't stand in awe of his peers - namely Facebook co-founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. 'I walked past his office and he's just sitting there, it was pretty surreal, every time I saw him he was in meetings,' he said. 'I look up to him, for sure, he started really little and now it's the biggest social media in the world and changed the world. 'I went to Facebook twice.'

'When I told them I was making apps and stuff, I told them ""trust me I am going to get to the top of the charts"" and after the game went viral they began to understand.' With the popularity, however, come the challenges. 'Social media is some good parts and some bad parts,' Ben said. 'It connects everyone and is easier to spread a message. 'But I am getting all this attention, about 200 Facebook friend requests a day, most I don't know, so I check them against mutual friends.'

"Ukip county organiser Paul Lovegrove has served two prison sentences - one for wounding with intent in 1996 and one for actual bodily harm in 2000 . Ukip has been plunged into crisis after senior activists and a general election candidate quit over the violent past of a local organiser. Nigel Farage has given his '100 per cent' backing to county organiser Paul Lovegrove after a storm sparked by his previous convictions for assault. The row has seen Don Jerrard quit as Ukip candidate in Fareham and sent shockwaves across the party in Hampshire, where Mr Lovegrove is in charge of the election campaign. Mr Lovegrove has served two prison sentences - one for wounding with intent in 1996 and one for actual bodily harm in 2000, the Portsmouth News reported. His past has been the subject of heated rows at Ukip meetings, culminating in Mr Jerrard abandoning plans to stand at the election. Former Portsmouth City Councillor Paul Godier and ex-Fareham and Gosport chairman Bob Ingram have also left the party, blaming Mr Lovegrove's criminal past. He was jailed for two years when he got into a fight over a family feud and grabbed a bread knife before slashing a man across the face. He served a year behind bars. He received a number of criminal convictions for drug possession but then went to college in an attempt to turn his life around. However, he then got into a fight with a man but fled to Spain to avoid a charge of actual bodily harm. With his partner he had two children on the Costa Del Sol, before returning to England after five years. He claims he was later beaten up in Guildford, and was charged with an allegation of sexual assault at knifepoint. He was cleared of this offence at a trial but was jailed for 12 months for the earlier actual bodily harm charge. However, Mr Farage is standing by Mr Lovegrove, insisting 'people deserve a second chance in life'. He told the newspaper: 'Mr Lovegrove may have fallen off the rails earlier in his life but he is now totally reformed and we are standing by him 100 per cent. We knew about his past. 'With any political party, having people from all walks of life is a bonus. After all you can't have every party full of Oxbridge graduates.' Don Jerrard (left) quit as Ukip candidate in Fareham but Ukip leader Nigel Farage says he is standing by Mr Lovegrove '100 per cent' Mr Farage added: 'You get divisions in all political parties but it does not affect what we stand for and we stand for the normal working class person. We are more united, focused and more able to get on with the job.' Ukip had its eye on the Fareham seat after former minister Mark Hoban announced he would not be standing as the Tory candidate. But the campaign has been thrown into down by Mr Jerrard's resignation. He said that 'no decent person would have anything to do with' Mr Lovegrove. 'I won't have anything to do with them. It is a shambles. They are in turmoil because they don't know what to do. They have not spoken to the people on the ground, the people that have made these complaints. 'It is a clear case of being in a hole and them digging as fast as they can and it's obvious they have something to hide. 'They are a total shambles, all of their own making.' Former Portsmouth City Councillor Paul Godier (left) and ex-Fareham and Gosport chairman Bob Ingram have also left the party, blaming Mr Lovegrove's criminal past . Mr Lovegrove says he never hid his criminal convictions after becoming county organiser on January 12. He said: 'Honesty gets you a long way. People don't like it. They find it scary. 'I am everything they despise as I can talk from experience. I have lived through all of these things. Who can represent us? It's got to be one of us. 'It is a shame they are trying to drag someone down who is a real son of this city. Ukip have put their money where their mouth is by supporting me. 'I am a product of this country they claim to govern so well. 'I have learnt from my mistakes - they happened 10 and 20 years ago and if we have never made any mistakes to learn by then how can we lead? 'I have had the pleasure and pain of life experiences which I hope to pass on through politics. 'I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth, like most people. The people in politics come from a different world. They don't have any idea.'","Anger over criminal past of Hampshire Ukip organiser Paul Lovegrove .

The pup took to the spotlight last fall when she debuted a rather unscary Halloween bear costume. Her owner Cindy Roth crafted the fluffy ensemble out of a plush toy. She then posted photographs and videos of Munchkin online, with many fans likening the animal to an 'adorable' version of the Star Wars Ewoks.

"Facebook has reportedly agreed to censor cartoons of Prophet Mohammed just two weeks after its founder defended the right to free speech in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo terror attacks. The social network made the decision after Turkish authorities threatened to block the site entirely if it did not remove the images - some of which come from Charlie Hebdo magazine. The dramatic about-face will be personally embarrassing for Zuckerberg, coming weeks  after he defiantly said: '[Facebook] will never let one country or group  dictate what people can share.' Facebook pages which 'insult' the Prophet Mohammed have been blocked in Turkey following a court order, leading to founder Mark Zuckerberg being blasted online . In a post dated January 8, while Said and Cherif Kouachi were still on the run having shot 12 people dead in Paris, he wrote: 'A few years ago, an extremist in Pakistan fought to have me sentenced to death because Facebook refused to ban content about Mohammed that offended him. 'We stood up for this because different voices -- even if they're sometimes offensive -- can make the world a better and more interesting place. 'Facebook has always been a place where people across the world share their views and ideas. 'We follow the laws in each country, but we never let one country or group of people dictate what people can share across the world. 'Yet as I reflect on yesterday's attack and my own experience with extremism, this is what we all need to reject -- a group of extremists trying to silence the voices and opinions of everyone else around the world. 'I won't let that happen on Facebook. I'm committed to building a service where you can speak freely without fear of violence. 'My thoughts are with the victims, their families, the people of France and the people all over the world who choose to share their views and ideas, even when that takes courage.' According to the BBC, Facebook has now blocked pages 'that offended the Prophet Mohammed' after getting an order from a court in Ankara, Turkey's capital. The exact number of pages is unknown, but some of the images on those pages come directly from the pages of Charlie Hebdo - the very images Zuckerberg was defending. Facebook's founder was branded 'a first rate coward', a 'sorry excuse for a human', and 'a liberal coward' by users after news of the decision became public. The dramatic about-face comes just weeks after Zuckerberg posted an impassioned defence of free speech, saying that Facebook will 'never let one country or group of people dictate what people can share' It is not the first time the website has been accused of double-standards by censoring content on behalf of dictatorial regimes while claiming to stand up for freedom of speech. In December last year, the site removed a Russian page linked to Alexei Navalny, a well-known critic of Valdimir Putin, after requests from internet regulators. Facebook has also been accused of censoring dissident groups in Syria and China, as well as campaign groups demanding freedom for Tibet. It is also the latest crackdown by the hard-line Turkish regime on dissenters. Earlier this month, Turkey's president began to press for new legislation which would allow ministers to temporarily ban websites,  and force Twitter to block an anonymous whistleblower. The proposed law would allow ministers to restrict access to websites deemed to threaten lives, public order or rights and freedoms. The Telecommunications Directorate (TIB) would have to comply within four hours, and then apply for a court order for the ban to be extended beyond 24 hours. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, pictured, had previously vowed to 'eradicate' Twitter after allegations of public corruption were published on the site . Communications minister Lutfu Elvan this week defended the proposal, saying it was needed after Turkey's top court in October annulled previous legislation giving greater powers to ban websites, and saying it would only be used in emergencies. Last year Turkey came under international criticism for temporary bans on Facebook and Twitter as a corruption scandal unfolded. Erdogan vowed to 'eradicate' Twitter after allegations of government corruption were published on the micro-blogging site. Meanwhile Facebook was briefly banned in Pakistan along with Twitter after the sites refused to remove pictures pertaining to be the Prophet Muhammad. Facebook did eventually bow to pressure and blocked the images in Pakistan.","Facebook will ban pages in Turkey which 'insult Prophet Mohammed'

"The former leader of Welsh nationalists Plaid Cymru  has sparked fury after comparing Britain's nuclear deterrent to the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz. Lord Wigley apologised for 'any offence caused' after hitting out at claims the Government could shift the Trident weapons system from Scotland to Wales. The peer dismissed the potential jobs boost for Wales, adding: 'Look, this week we have been remembering what happened in Germany before the war, no doubt there were many jobs provided in Auschwitz and places like that but that didn't justify their existence and neither does nuclear weapons justify having them in Pembrokeshire.' Lord Wigley defended comparing Britain's nuclear weapons to Nazi death camps. He said: 'The number of people that will be killed by Trident will be infinitely more' Challenged as to why he was comparing a Trident base to the notorious death camp, he replied: 'The number of people that will be killed by Trident will be infinitely more.' In a statement released later, Lord Wigley said: 'I am certainly sorry if my remarks were open to any misinterpretation and I apologise for any offence that has been caused.' He added: 'The point I was trying to make was that you can't have jobs at any cost and I reiterate that.' Former Welsh secretary David Jones branded Lord Wigley's comments 'crass', and said he was right to offer an apology - albeit a 'mealy-mouthed' one. 'His remarks were crass and defensive, and while the apology is a bit mealy-mouthed, at least it is good that he has acknowledged they are offensive,' the Tory MP for Clwyd West said. Mr Jones said it was 'not appropriate at any time' to use Auschwitz to make political points. 'Nothing that ever happens in this country could ever be as appalling as what the Nazis did,' he added. 'But to say it at Holocaust memorial time is even worse.' A  Trident Nuclear Submarine, HMS Victorious, on patrol off the west coast of Scotland on April 4, 2013 . Survivors pass the main gate of the former Nazi  extermination camp Auschwitz prior to a ceremony marking the 70th anniversary of their liberation yesterday . Dafydd Wigley is one of the biggest figures in Welsh nationalist politics having led Plaid Cymru for two stints totalling some 12 years. In 1974 he was among the first three MPs the party secured at a general election, and held the seat for nearly three decades. He first became leader in 1981, but resigned three years later when his twin sons became ill. After taking charge of Plaid again in 1991, Mr Wigley boosted its representation and played a major role in the referendum that established the Welsh Assembly. But in 2000 he stepped down as leader on medical advice, having suffered heart problems. He left Westminster at the election the following year - when Plaid recorded a 14.3 per cent vote share - and the Assembly in 2003. In 2010, at the age of 67, the politician ended his hiatus from parliament, becoming Lord Wigley. Current leader Leanne Wood has appointed him as Plaid's election co-ordinator for this May's contest, where the party hopes to double its tally of three MPs. Lord Wigley initially drew the comparison between Trident and a Nazi death camp in an untaped conversation, before repeating them in an interview for the BBC and the Press Association. He said: 'The point I'm making is that you have to look at what a job entails not just the fact that there is a job located in any particular area and, in this instance, we do not believe that we should have nuclear weapons at all, we believe that Trident shouldn't be renewed and we most certainly don't want that renewal to happen in Pembrokeshire or anywhere in Wales or, to be fair, anywhere in Britain. Pressed on whether he was suggesting there was a 'moral comparison' between working on a Trident base and working at a Nazi death camp, Lord Wigley said: 'No, the point I was making was this, that you have to consider the nature of the work and not just that a job exists.' The remarks by Lord Wigley, Plaid's election co-ordinator, came after commemorations were held at Auschwitz to mark 70 years since its liberation. Some 300 survivors returned the the site in Poland - where around 1.1 million people were killed between 1940 and 1945. The SNP strongly opposes the renewal of Trident, but the UK Government has dismissed reports that the Ministry of Defence is making contingency plans for the weapons to be relocated from Scotland to Wales. Prime Minister David Cameron's spokesman said: 'There are no plans whatsoever. It is not on the table at all.' Scottish First Minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon distanced herself from Lord Wigley's comments. 'It is not language I would use. It is not a comparison I would make,' she said. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael said the comments were 'offensive' and trivialised the Holocaust. 'I visited Auschwitz with a group of Scottish school kids on a Holocaust educational trip a few years ago and it's only when you visit the place that you understand the sheer scale of the horrors that were perpetuated there,' he said. 'It's offensive to our servicemen and servicewomen who work there (at Faslane) - and that's bad enough. But it really is offensive towards the people who suffered and died in Auschwitz. 'It tells you a lot about the attitudes that you get from people whose judgment seems to go out of the window when a topic like this comes into play. It's not a rational position. 'The whole point is Auschwitz's place in history is because of the people who died there and not the people that worked there. And if you trivialise that - and that is trivialising it - then you increase the chances that something like that could happen again. 'There are some things that shouldn't be used in day-to-day politics and Holocaust memorial is one of them.'","Lord Wigley apologised for 'any offence caused' after making 'crass' claim .

"Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is strongly hinting at a White House run. The union-busting Republican governor, known nationally for his triumph in a 2012 recall election, is making the rounds in early primary states and on Tuesday evening launched a political committee. 'I don’t think it’s ever been good to bet against me,' Walker said last night of a possible presidential campaign while on Sean Hannity's Fox News program. 'I wouldn’t be betting against me in a race like this, either.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker walks off the stage after speaking at the Freedom Summit in Des Moines, Iowa, on Saturday. Walker had a breakthrough moment at the forum for conservatives in the early presidential primary state and on Tuesday took a step toward a presidential run . Recently inaugurated to a second term, Walker overcame the odds in November and won his third statewide election since 2010. Less than one year into his first term Walker was confronted with a recall election by critics of a bill he helped push through the Wisconsin legislature that sharply cut back on collective bargaining rights for unionized workers and increased the amount of money that state and local government employees were expected to contribute to their pensions. After a court battle that landed the law in Wisconsin's highest court, Republicans in the state emerged victorious. The kerfuffle sparked backlash against Walker and in November of 2011 his opponents began the effort to get him removed from office along with his Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch. The duo made history on June 5, 2012, when they won the challenge with a larger share of the vote than they did in their initial election. Walker is the first and only governor to have survived a recall in U.S. history. The 47-year-old Republican politician was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado, to a Baptist minister and a bookkeeper. His family relocated to Wisconsin when he was 10. Walker attended Marquette University but left before he obtained a degree and joined the staff of the American Red Cross. He began his career in Wisconsin politics in 1990 with a campaign for the state assembly. He lost that race but won a special election in another district three years later. That same year he married his wife, Tonette. The couple has two sons together, Matt and Alex. The teenagers take classes at Marquette University and University of Wisconsin-Madison, respectively. The elder Walker served in the Wisconsin State Assembly nearly a decade before running for and winning a seat on Milwaukee County's executive committee, a role he stayed in until being promoted to governor. Walker's first attempt at the governor's mansion ended with him dropping out of the race early because he was unable to raise enough money to support the bid. Four years later, in 2010, he and Kleefisch were elected to the state's top two posts - positions they have held ever since. Long considered a dark horse candidate for president, Walker's stock went up in November after he cemented his reelection in Wisconsin. While he has not specifically stated his intentions to compete for the keys to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. he's made at least one high-profile political hire in the last few weeks that would otherwise seem odd given that he's only just begun his second term as governor. Nothing in Wisconsin law would prevent Walker from seeking an unlimited amount of terms, however, should he show interest in staying on in 2019. Walker recently brought on former Republican National Committee political director Rick Wiley to run his newly founded Our American Revival political committee, which is legally considered a 527. The tax-exempt group can raise unlimited amounts of money for Walker's national travel as long as he's not officially a candidate any office. It cannot share its money with candidates or candidates' political action committees, though. Meaning, if Walker were to run for president, the money in that fund could not be transferred to his campaign - or anyone else's campaign, for that matter. The organization can advocate on behalf of the policies that Walker has spent his career defending, though, one of the governor's aides told the Washington Post, and that's the role it will take on if Walker enters the 2016 competition. 'Our American Revival encompasses the shared values that make our country great: limiting the powers of the federal government to those defined in the Constitution while creating a leaner, more efficient, more effective and more accountable government to the American people,' Walker said in a statement announcing the political group. In his Saturday speech at the Freedom Summit, Walker promised Iowa voters that he would return to the state 'many more times in the future.' Last night he said on Hannity that he planned to visit Iowa and two other important primary states - New Hampshire and South Carolina - in the coming weeks . If the purpose of the group wasn't clear already - to serve as a launching pad for Walker's national aspirations - a video released by Our American Revival on Tuesday night with its website launch answered that very question. 'America stands on the brink,'a male narrator with a quintessential campaign ad voice states. 'At a time and place in our history where failed leaders preside over a nation adrift, with family incomes in steady decline, dreams stifled, and a foreign policy that apologize for America, an dprojects weakness abroad, America can't stop this by looking to the past, or for answers in Washington, D.C.' Throughout his speech, pictures of Barack Obama and and presumed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton flash on the screen. The first shows Obama talking to current Secretary of State John Kerry and National Security Advisor Susan Rice. Another depicts Obama bowing to Japanese emperor Akihito. Shifting to photos of Walker, the narrator says, 'To reclaim our destiny, we must turn to bold, fresh and new ideas from those incubators of reform - the states.' 'Those groups in Washington, they tend to measure success by how many people are dependent on the government, ' Walker can be heard saying in a speech to roars from the crowd as a photo of Obama and former Secretary of State Clinton standing side by side at an event appears. 'We measure success by how many people are no longer dependent on the government,' he concludes. The not-so-subtle implication is evident: Clinton would continue the foreign policies of her predecessor, Obama. Walker, left, takes the oath of office from Shirley Abrahamson, Chief Justice of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, during his inauguration ceremony at the Wisconsin Capitol, on Jan. 5. Pictured behind the governor are his son Alex and wife, Tonette. Not seen is his son Matt . A video for Walker's new political committee, Our American Revival, uses this photo of President Barack Obama bowing to Japanese Emperor Akihito in 2009 to bash Obama's leadership on foreign policy issues . Not previously considered they type of fiery speaker that riles up conservatives, Walker has made significant strides in that direction throughout the past year. A speech he gave over the weekend at Iowa Congressman Steve King's first-ever Freedom Summit had attendees leaving with a new perspective on his probable presidential campaign. Walker was widely panned by media attendees as the breakout speaker of the event. The event's host, the uber conservative Rep. King, agreed. Basically, the press reports I read were mostly accurate in their analysis,' King told Bloomberg Politics. 'Probably the person who helped himself the most would be Scott Walker,' King said. 'The bar wasn't as high, and he gave a good speech. He connected with the audience in a good, constructive way.' Walker repeated some of his favorite lines to the audience, several of which were also featured in his Our American Revival video, including the claim about government dependency, and promised Iowa voters that he would return to the state 'many more times in the future.' Last night on Hannity's program he confirmed that he'd be back in early primary state Iowa soon, as well as first in the nation state New Hampshire and South Carolina, another state with a race-making - or breaking - primary. 'My budget [will] come out next Tuesday — for the fifth and sixth year in a row I’ll lower property taxes,' Walker said on Hannity, according to the Washington Times. 'I want a few months to get that job done,' he said, 'but I’m going to be in New Hampshire, in South Carolina and back in Iowa and we’re going to be talking about these issues for the next several months, [because] we’re excited about where we can take this country.'","Walker is known for his triumph in a 2012 recall; he is the first and only U.S. governor to survive a recall and was just inaugurated to a second term .

"It has rapidly become the favourite pastime of people the world over - taking a picture of yourself and plastering it over the internet for all  to admire. From A-list Hollywood royalty to that funny-looking bloke down the pub, it seems many of us can barely go five minutes without whipping out our mobiles to grab a few quick frames. Even U.S President Barack Obama is not above it all - famously posing up with British Prime Minister David Cameron and Denmark's Prime Minister Helle Thorning Schmidt at the funeral of Nelson Mandela. Scroll down for video . Barack Obama  poses for a selfie  with British Prime Minister David Cameron and Denmark's Prime Minister Helle Thorning Schmidt at the funeral of Nelson Mandela . But now several locations across the world are moving to stamp out the narcissistic craze with bans and fines so are we finally seeing a war on selfies? Garoupe, France . A section of The Garoupe, a popular beach in Southern France, is cracking down on people constantly boasting about their holidays to friends back at home by working with mobile network, Three, to create designated 'No Braggies Zones'. A spokesperson for the beach said: 'The Garoupe beaches are among the most glamorous and pristine beaches in all of France and we want people to be able to enjoy our exclusive beach in the moment, not spending the majority of their time bragging to their friends and family back home.' Just chillin': Lily Allen showing off to over half a million Instagram followers from the beach in St Tropez . The 'braggie', similar to the 'selfie', is a word that has firmly wiggled its way into the popular lexicon, and is a term that's been coined to describe the humble brag pictures of people enjoying a fancy cocktail, walking in the sand or gazing at a sunset. Iran . Iran's footballers were warned they could face punishment if they take selfies with female fans who turned out in droves to see their idols play at the Asian Cup. The head of the Iranian Football Federation's moral committee said players risked being used as a 'political tool' if snapped with female fans.

Women are banned from attending men's sports events in the Islamic republic of Iran . Women are banned from attending men's sports events in the Islamic republic, but flocked to see Iran's games hosted by Australia where no such rule applies. Head of Iranian Football Federation's moral committee, Ali Akbar Mohamedzade, issued the warning last week as photos of players with female fans circulated on social media. 'National team players should be aware that they won't be used as a political tool so that those who take pictures with them don't use these photos against the players,' Iran's Shahrvand newspaper quoted him as saying. 'So according to this they should not take photos with everyone. If the players don't respect this, we will be obliged to take action.' South Korea . In December last year  South Korean authorities banned the use of  selfie-sticks - short poles with a clip on the end to hold a mobile phone which make it easier to take selfies. Officials decided the sticks' use of Bluetooth makes them 'telecommunications devices' that must be tested and registered in case they interfere with other gadgets. Selfie-sticks are the must-have gift this year after becoming popular in Asia. Above, a tourist uses one of the gadgets while touring London landmarks . Basic selfie sticks are simply an extendable pole, meaning the selfie-taker sets the phone timer to take a picture. But more advanced versions have Bluetooth shutter releases on the handles which link to your smartphone meaning you can control exactly when you take your picture. They come in a variety of colours and styles. As well as being popular for group shots, the sticks are increasingly appearing at sporting events and concerts as a way of getting above a crowd to capture an action image. Saudi Arabia . Islamic clerics have issued a warning against people taking selfies on their Hajj pilgrimages to Mecca saying they 'defy the wish of our Prophet'. The annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca has seen a rise in the number of pictures being taken on camera phones during the rite of passage in Saudi Arabia as followers share their experiences with family and friends back home. But some scholars have taken issue with the practice, which they see as a 'touristy' distraction from the prayers and rituals that form one of the five pillars of Islam. Islamic clerics have issued a warning against people taking selfies on their Hajj pilgrimages to Mecca saying they 'defy the wish of our Prophet'. Jeddah-based scholar Sheikh Assim Al-Hakeem told Arab News: 'Photography without a legitimate reason is an issue of dispute among scholars. 'However, despite this difference of opinion, there shouldn't be any dispute when it comes to the real meaning of Haj and the essence behind it. 'It is based on sincerity and following the sunnah. The Prophet (peace be upon him) when he went for Hajj, he said: 'O Allah, I ask of you a pilgrimage that contains no boasting or showing of'. Taking such selfies and videos defy the wish of our Prophet.' Meanwhile, fellow scholar Abdul Razzaq Al-Badr added: 'It is as though the only purpose of this trip is to take pictures and not worship.' Camera phones were, until a few years ago, banned from the holy mosques, but authorities appear to have relaxed the rules more recently. Pamplona, Spain . This is one selfie ban that few could complain about. Last year a man attending the annual Running of the Bulls in Pamplona, Spain, was fined $4,100 (3,000 euros) for taking a picture as he attempted to flee the charging bulls. Selfies have been banned by organisers of the Pamplona Bull Run as a protective measure for runners navigating the streets as the animals charge behind them . Event's organisers say the ban is a protective measure for runners who must navigate the streets of Pamplona as the bulls charge behind them and should really be concentrating on nothing else. 15 people have been killed during the Pamplona Bull Runs  since 1911, with the last death five years ago. New York . Starting from next month, New York will become the first U.S state where it is illegal to pose for a photo with a lion, tiger or other big cat. The measure - which specifically prohibits contact between members of the public and big cats at animal shows - was passed after self-portraits with the animals started becoming more popular online, particularly with some young men on dating sites. Paws for the camera: In New York in February, it becomes illegal to pose for a photo with a lion, tiger or other big cat . Australian Open Tennis, Melbourne . Tennis fans eager to capture a selfie at the Australian Open have been warned against using selfie sticks courtside - but the message hasn't sunk in with the players themselves. Organisers are discouraging people visiting Melbourne Park against using the controversial stick to take snaps during matches over fears it could block other competition goers’ views. Tennis Australia say that the sticks have not been banned but they have ‘asked for people to use their discretion and use them sensibly’. But stars such as Maria Sharapova and Novak Djokovic don't seem to mind at all - with the Russian star posting a hilarious selfie with her shy boyfriend, Bulgarian tennis player Grigor Dimitrov, while the Serbian men's favourite has happily posed with fans. Novak Djokovic enjoyed taking time out to pose for selfies with fans at the Australian Open . A spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia: ‘We made the decision not to ban them because we think people will be happy to use them responsibly. ‘People love them and many people got them for Christmas, they are a big novelty and we don’t’ want to stop people using them.’ Organisers are most concerned about the sticks distracting fans and players during matches. They have requested people ‘don’t use them in and around the courts when you might be affecting people's views… so don’t use them during in a match… it’s working very well so far,’ the spokesperson said. As part of the Australian Open’s social media plan, 20 dedicated selfie zones have been set up around the Park. ‘The selfie zone idea was more of a call to action rather than telling people where they should take their photos,’ Tennis Australia said. London . David Cameron and Barack Obama may be among the politicians who have joined the trend of taking ‘selfies’ But voters who take a picture of themselves in the polling booth  could be jailed, it has been warned. British voters who take a picture of themselves and their ballot paper in the polling booth risk breaching secrecy laws and could be jailed The Electoral Commission has  warned . The Electoral Commission wrote to all returning officers involved in last year's local and European elections to tell them the selfies are illegal. People who tweet photos of themselves and their ballot papers risk breaching secrecy laws and face a £5,000 fine or up to six months in jail. But campaigners have said the pictures, which could be nicknamed ‘boothies’, could have encouraged people to vote. The phenomenon has been popular in the Netherlands and some U.S. states where the polling booth selfies are legal.","Man fined €3,000 after snapping selfie as he ran with the bulls in Pamplona .

"Kimberley Lindfield, pictured, a former youth volunteer for St John Ambulance, told family and friends she was being verbally abused and felt 'intimidated' by people living next door . A 27-year-old woman who was honoured by Princess Anne for her dedication to charity work was found hanged after complaining she was being intimidated by noisy neighbours, an inquest heard. Kimberley Lindfield, a former youth volunteer for St John Ambulance, was branded a 'grass' by neighbours after she reported their constant loud music to the housing association. She told friends and family that she was left feeling 'scared' and 'stressed' after being verbally abused and had requested a burglar alarm be installed in her flat, it was heard. Miss Lindfield, who battled depression and bulimia for 12 years, was found hanged in Wythenshawe Hospital, Manchester, in July 2012 - just hours after she was admitted following a suspected overdose. She died six days later. The inquest at Manchester Coroner's Court heard that Miss Lindfield had said her neighbours would turn their music up 'really loud just to scare her' while another couple would shout at her. The charity worker, described as 'beautiful' and 'intelligent' by her family, was branded a 'grass' when she informed the housing association about the noise. Staff at the hospital said Miss Lindfield complained that was 'sick of her neighbours annoying her' shortly before her death. Her friend, Ashley-Ann Vowden, told the inquest: 'She always felt they were trying to intimidate her. 'On one occasion I was talking to Kim on the phone and I could hear a female voice. She was shouting at Kim calling her a grass due to the housing association having been called in due to the noise. 'Kim loved her flat. She was very proud of it and how it looked. She wanted to stay in her flat but at the same time she thought if she moved it would be easier.' Miss Lindfield had previously enrolled at Manchester Metropolitan University to study Applied Community Studies but suffered a break down due to the stress of studying and being away from her home in Cheshire. She returned to Manchester and was moved into the rented flat in Wythenshawe after  receiving counselling from a mental health charity for her issues. Her mother, Kerry Bentley, told the inquest that her daughter's problems started off as being noise related, but escalated into aggression. She said: 'I once advised her to go to housing which she did. She can be very capable. I offered to come with her but she said she'd sort it out. 'She did put in a complaint and they sorted out the initial problem. 'What she didn't tell them was that the neighbours started to become aggressive toward her. When I asked her about it a week or so before her last admission to hospital I knew it was bothering her. The inquest heard that Miss Lindfield, pictured, had said her neighbours would turn their music up really loud 'just to scare her' while another couple would shout at her. She was branded a 'grass' when she complained . 'Without me knowing she had applied for an alarm in the flat. She had started to get worried about someone breaking in. I hadn't realised. When asked about it she just said she ignored them.' Miss Lindfield received support from mental health charity 42nd Street, which works with young people aged 13-25, but was referred to other programmes when she turned 25. She was involved in a number of projects to help train social work students to handle young people with mental health issues and spoke at conferences on the topic. Ms Bentley, a teacher, told the inquest that she feared her daughter had not received enough support when she was referred elsewhere once her counselling with 42nd Street ended. She added that her daughter had admitted to her that she was also bulimic. She said: 'I would speak to her every couple of days. Sometimes she would not answer because she was feeling low or couldn't be bothered. 'We had agreed because I would worry myself that she would text back ""ok"" and she would say something like ""I'm fine but I don't want to talk. We used to see her quite regularly. I would visit her and she would come to our house for Sunday tea'. Described by her family as 'a beautiful, funny, intelligent, creative and caring young woman', Miss Lindfield had won a string of awards for dedicated voluntary work. Her commitment to St John's Ambulance was recognised with the Grand Prior Award, which was given to her by Princess Anne at Buckingham Palace. The volunteer also received the Princess Diana Memorial Award, which is given to young people who unselfishly inspire and improve the lives of others in their communities. Miss Lindfield moved into the rented flat in Wythenshawe, pictured, where she said she felt intimidated and was verbally abused. She complained to the housing association and applied for an alarm to be installed . In a statement posted online, Joanna Shaw, Youth Support Worker and Tess Gregson, Senior Youth Worker at 42nd Street, paid tribute to the 'inspiring' and 'loyal' young woman. They said: Kim will be remembered for her honesty, her ability to fight for what she and others believed in, the sheer loyalty and dedication Kim gave to the organisation and young people who came to 42nd Street. It is a privilege to have been part of Kim’s life.' Ms Bentley said: 'She was a very clever woman. She was very capable. She stood up to speak at conferences about issues of mental health. She added: 'We felt very frustrated for Kim and Kim being kept out of the loop in regards what medication and what her diagnosis was. I do not think there was ever a formal diagnosis. When I asked Kim I don't think she was sure herself.' The former St John's Ambulance volunteer was found hanged in Wythenshawe Hospital, Manchester, pictured, in July 2012 - just hours after she was admitted following a suspected overdose . 'I just wish there was more support out there. We don't know what to do. I tried to talk to Kim about her mental health and she would get upset. Given the fact I did not want to upset her more, I would back off.' Miss Lindfield was admitted to Wythenshawe Hospital on July 17 2012 with a suspected overdose of medication and later told a care support worker worker she was feeling down and 'stressed' about her neighbours. She died on July 23. Michelle O'Donnell , Care Support Worker at Wythenshawe said: 'She said she was fed up. She was sick of her neighbours annoying her. She had trouble with her neighbours. She was fed up. She couldn't be bothered anymore. She wanted to do it again and she said she would do it again when she got home.' Since her death, her family and friends have set up the Kim Linfield Trust to raise money for 42nd Street, which has had its funding cut. It has raised more £7,000 so far. The inquest continues.

"Last week scientists at Birmingham University claimed to have come up with the perfect formula for stacking a dishwasher. But rather than causing cheers all round, it has intensified the bitter arguments that rage every day among the millions of dishwasher-owning households nationwide. So who are the best dishwasher stackers? Husbands — or wives? Alice and Justin Smellie (pictured) like many couples, have long battled over the best way to stack a dishwasher . Alice and Justin Smellie, who have been locked in a dishwasher war for most of their 12-year marriage, invited Emily Wimborne, dishwasher expert at retailer John Lewis, into their home to settle the argument once and for all. Alice says: . Early evening, and peace has descended. The children have been fed and watered and the house is (reasonably) clean. I’m about to settle into the sofa with a well-deserved glass of wine when I hear bad-tempered clattering in the kitchen. I peer around the door and see Justin, crouching in a cloud of steam, hastily rearranging the contents of the dishwasher mid-cycle. He just cannot help himself. Convinced of his dishwasher-stacking superiority, he cannot bear to leave this most vital domestic task in my — in his opinion — incapable hands. Alice and Justin put their differing techniques to the test under the watchful eye of Emily Wimborne a dishwasher expert at John Lewis . Justin clearly is not alone. Those Birmingham University scientists actually published a research paper on dishwasher stacking. They solemnly tracked water movement inside the machine, deciding what should be put where — in relation to the position of water jets and dirtiness of the crockery — to come up with the perfect formula. I’m afraid I read this report and snorted; just as I do when Justin nitpicks over the placing of plates and bowls when he could be enjoying a glass of wine on the sofa with me. It’s a machine for washing up. Just chuck your dishes in, I say. Every day after breakfast I throw cereal bowls, spoons, milk pan and toast plates willy-nilly into our ten-year-old Bosch and leave it to do its stuff. Alice takes the view that it's a machine for washing up and therefore everything that goes in will somehow end up getting clean . In my opinion, all the dishes will get clean somehow. The worst case scenario is that I end up hand-washing a few less-than-perfect items afterwards. Really, what’s the problem? But when I return from the school run, invariably I find that a scientifically-minded pixie has popped in for a visit. That’s a male pixie in his mid-40s, wearing a cardigan and harrumphing as he rearranges the dishwasher to his own satisfaction. Crockery is rinsed, glasses arranged in height size and all the cutlery is facing upwards. This same pixie has also taken out anything heavily soiled ‘to hand wash’. I’m afraid Justin thinks I am a slattern and I think he is an insane perfectionist. Some of the bitterest words of our marriage have been spoken over a box of Finish dishwasher tablets. Emily Wimborne (left) was visibly horrified by the way Alice (right) was stacking the dishwasher . But now scientists are on the case, I realise there may be more to dishwasher stacking than I thought. Although they vary widely in price and size, dishwashers all work on the same principle: water in the bottom of the appliance heats up, then two rotating spray arms — one under the lower rack and one under the upper one — spray the water at the dishes. Currently, around 30 per cent of us own a dishwasher — which horrifies me. How do the rest cope? I always thought it was as vital to a kitchen as pots and pans. Alice values speed over efficiency when dealing with the dishes, whereas Justin takes a more methodical approach . And dishwasher wars are rife: 42 per cent of people surveyed last September admitted they had reloaded the dishwasher after their family had gone to bed because they thought it was done incorrectly. And there is the entirely reasonable sounding statistic that 79 per cent had put a load through again just to save the bother of unloading the dishwasher. Guilty as charged, M’Lud. Justin, in a tragic attempt to impose order on a chaotic world (or rather, his chaotic wife) once talked me through his method. It did not end well. I still could not see why his method was better than any other. For our test together, I coated a number of plates with egg, lasagne, Weetabix and baked beans, swilled milk and red wine around glasses, and filled cups with coffee then tipped it away. I gave Justin and myself an identical number of dishes to stack, then we put them through the same 45-minute cycle. Emily actually looks sad as she watches me throwing everything in. As far as I’m concerned it’s all about speed — and nothing else. I stuff the cutlery into the basket, not caring whether it’s handle-end or blade-end facing down. Plates are put in any spare slot, and I don’t care whether serving dishes go on the bottom rack or the top. Glasses and mugs are also placed wherever I can see a space. Poor thing. Emily has devoted her life to appliances and here I am, abusing one. I actually see her wince at one point of the process and begin to wonder if I should be giving the whole thing more thought. Yet the job is done in minutes. The door is slammed shut and the reassuring sound of churning water fills the kitchen. I still cannot imagine how the end result would differ from anyone else’s. Emily's verdict: The only good thing I can say about Alice’s stacking is that it’s fast. Otherwise, it’s a disaster. She has put the lasagne pan on top, taking up masses of space. It’s further from the powerful jets of water at the bottom and so is unlikely to get clean. Emily (pictured) said: 'the only good thing I can say about Alice’s stacking is that it’s fast. Otherwise, it’s a disaster' All the cutlery is facing downwards, where the water can’t get to the business end as easily and she’s barely scraped the dishes. The glasses at the bottom are more likely to get damaged because they’re more likely to get knocked over by the powerful bottom jets. Most of it is filthy when the wash is finished and I am particularly disgusted by the glass of water which she shoved in upside down and which ended up full of cloudy water and old baked beans. A total dishwashing fail. Time taken: Two minutes . Stacking: 4/10 . Cleanliness: 3/10 . Justin says: . When I read the University of Birmingham paper, it resonated with good sense. Lead researcher Dr Raul Perez-Mohedano, suggested packing the dishes according to the type of stain they demonstrate. So potato and tomato need as much force as possible from the water jets. Proteins such as egg yolk need more chemical detergent. In our household, where I am the only person with the ability to stack a dishwasher, this, sadly, will never happen. Justin (pictured) has taken note of the work done by researcher Dr Raul Perez-Mohedano, who suggests stacking disghes according to the stains they demonstrate . One of my daily chores, as necessary as the dog walking and school run, is re-stacking the dishwasher. At least twice. If Alice turns it on before I catch her, I often have to pull it open at the end of a cycle, look despairingly inside and put it on again because not one of the plates or cups is clean. My approach is — I believe — obvious, straightforward and logical. I rinse dirty food from plates before putting them in. Cutlery faces upwards and the more tidily it is lined up, why, the more likely it is to get clean. Anything which is too dirty is washed by hand. Justin, pictured with Emily, has a logical approach which involves rinsing the worst affected dishes and stacking cutlery upright . I wonder whether the oft-quoted idea that men have superior spatial awareness skills, and a natural leaning towards creating ‘systems’, such as filing and rotas, may be why I am so much better than this than Alice. There’s also an argument that testosterone helps us achieve dominance in whatever goal we set ourselves. Perhaps my determination to stack the dishwasher correctly makes it a success. (Though I can’t help thinking it’s a bit of a waste of my testosterone). There is clearly never going to be any resolution of the argument in our house, as each of us is convinced they are right. Realistically, neither of us is prepared to concede any ground. So, I was happy to hand the argument over to an expert, in a bid to prove that my way is right. Emily’s verdict: Every single item emerged sparkling and clean. Justin’s method is beautifully orderly. All the mug handles are pointing in the same direction, so you can just pull them out together and put them away quickly. Justin (pictured) scored a massive 9.5/10 for his stacking abilities and 9/10 for cleanliness, losing marks only for putting the detergent in the cutlery basket . The same size plates are carefully stacked together and pans and heavy objects are on the bottom — nearer to both the detergent and the jets of water. Everything is placed at a careful angle so all the water runs off. I removed half a point from Justin’s score, but only because he put the detergent in the cutlery basket. For optimal cleaning the detergent should only be released when the water is at the right temperature. But otherwise this is brilliant. Almost professional. Time taken: Six minutes . Marks for stacking: 9.5/10 . Marks for cleanliness: 9/10 . Justin’s reaction: I suspect that the smug look on my face is unbearable. I am grinning and holding up two shiny clean plates I’ve pulled from our dishwasher. I am clearly the overall winner of the decade long Dishwasher Wars in the Smellie household. Alice’s reaction: OK, so some of the plates came out a little grubby. So what? Now Justin’s superiority has been confirmed, I am happy to hand over the task in its entirety to him. I hope he and the dishwasher are very happy together.","Alice and Justin Smellie wage war daily over the best way to stack a dishwasher .

"Care home staff overdosed a pensioner with sedatives because she ‘complained too much’. Barbara Oldham, 85, was given so much promazine she could not lift her head as she sat in a chair and was unable to speak or walk. The drug, which is used to treat severely agitated behaviour, was administered after Mrs Oldham was moved to the Bupa-run Carders Court in Castleton, near Rochdale. Staff had claimed she was disruptive with other residents. Barbara Oldham, 85, was overdosed with sedatives by staff at the Bupa-run Carders Court, near Rochester, because she 'complained too much' Her son Andrew, 47, noticed his once chatty mother had become withdrawn but workers denied giving her too many tablets and said she was merely tired. The theatre promoter later filed a complaint with Rochdale social services which found she was needlessly given the drug on a nightly basis from October 2011 to January 2012. Mrs Oldham, who had been a department store worker, was moved to another care home and recovered from her ordeal. Seven months after her death in March 2014, Bupa Services agreed to pay Mr Oldham £5,000 damages in an out-of-court settlement for his medical negligence claim. Mr Oldham said: ‘Although I’ll never be able to forget how badly my mother was treated at Carders Court, the compensation goes some way towards giving my mum the justice she deserves. ‘I had concerns about my mother’s care since she moved into Carders Court because it seemed certain staff members took a dislike to her, and I reported a number of incidents to management. ‘My mum was a lovely, bubbly character but she started to become withdrawn and appeared more sedated and drugged every time I visited her. Bupa Services has agreed to pay Mr Oldham £5,000 damages in an out-of-court settlement for his medical negligence claim. Pictured: Carders Court Residential and Nursing Home in Rochdale . ‘Sometimes she was asleep for the whole visit so I raised concerns with various members of staff that she appeared over-medicated but it fell on deaf ears. I became convinced that she was being given too many drugs. It is utterly disgusting the way she was treated.’ Mrs Oldham, who suffered from depression, moved to Carders Court in July 2002 after the previous care home she lived in closed down. She was prescribed 5ml of promazine on an irregular basis which meant it was to be used at night as and when required to boost her mood, but not on a regular basis. The dosage was dropped to 2.5ml on December 11, 2011, on the recommendation of a community psychiatric nurse. Mr Oldham, who lives in Blackpool, added: ‘I was never happy with her treatment there and made a number of complaints. ‘I worked in social services and I knew that the treatment she was receiving wasn’t good enough.’ Andrew Oldham, pictured with an image of his mother, said he was never happy with his mother's treatment . A social worker at Rochdale Council’s adult care services unit conducted an investigation and uncovered the overdosing. Staff signatures on medication administration records provided clear evidence. Promazine was also found to be given on nights where the records show that Mrs Oldham was settled and not agitated. In the week before Christmas 2011, she was regularly given double doses. A spokesman for the home told the Mail: 'We are sorry that Mrs Oldham’s care did not meet our usual high standards. The health and wellbeing of our residents is our absolute priority. 'This was an isolated incident that happened two years ago. The medication had been prescribed by the resident’s own doctor to be given “as required”. ‘The home has since taken action to prevent this happening again. We have introduced a new policy whereby staff must notify the resident’s GP if a resident has been given ‘as required’ (PRN) medication for five consecutive days. ‘Staff have also been given extra training to ensure that they fully document the reasons why a PRN medication has been administered. The home has remained fully compliant with CQC standards during this time.’","Barbara Oldham, 85, was overdosed with sedatives by care home staff .

Facebook, which turns 11 years old this year, began offering mobile ads in 2012, the year its stock began publicly trading. More recently, Facebook expanded into video ads, which are very lucrative, and last year it re-launched Atlas, a tool for marketers to better target people across 'devices, platforms and publishers' and to measure how well the ads work. The company is still a long way from catching up to rival Google in the digital advertising market, though. In 2014, Facebook had a nearly 8 percent share of the market compared with Google's 31 percent according to eMarketer. That's an increase for Facebook and a slight decrease for Google from 2013. After paying preferred dividends Facebook earned $696 million, or 25 cents per share, in the October-December quarter, up from $520 million, or 20 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier. 890 million people use Facebook every day, the new figures show . Adjusted earnings totaled 54 cents per share. Analysts, on average, were expecting adjusted earnings of 48 cents per share, according to FactSet. Revenue grew to $3.85 billion from $2.59 billion a year earlier, also topping analysts' $3.78 billion forecast. Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia says the company has 'made it clear' that it expects revenue growth rates to slow due to tough comparisons, but added that this 'should not be a big concern, especially for long-term investors.' Facebook, which owns the popular photo-sharing app Instagram and the messaging service WhatsApp, has launched stand-alone mobile apps of its own, in a move that helps it take up more real estate on people's phones. Revenue grew to $3.85 billion from $2.59 billion a year earlier, also topping analysts' $3.78 billion forecast. Besides its Messenger app, though, these apps have seen limited success. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has promised that Facebook will continue investing in new areas that might not pay off for a long time. This includes its purchase of Oculus, a small company that makes virtual reality goggles, last year. The company's ambitious project, Internet.org, meanwhile, aims to connect everyone on Earth to the Internet. Zuckerberg said recently that it's a misconception that Facebook does everything for business reasons. 'I can promise you that if what I cared about was making more money, I would take the engineers and the people who are working on Internet.org and spreading connectivity around the world and have them go work on our ads product,' he told an audience recently in Bogota, Colombia. The firm has also seen a huge rise in the number of mobile users . Case in point, costs and expenses for the fourth quarter rose 87 percent to $2.72 billion from a year earlier. Shares of Menlo Park, California-based Facebook are down less than 2 percent year-to-date. The stock closed up 49 cents at $76.27 before the report and slid about 9 cents after the bell. Over the past 12 months, the stock has gained about 39 percent, compared with a 13 percent increase for the Standard & Poor's 500 index.

"Court case: Rapist footballer Ched Evans, pictured this week, claims he has new evidence he believes will help him overturn his conviction and help him return to professional football . Rapist footballer Ched Evans claimed today he has new evidence he believes will help him overturn his conviction. The disgraced striker, 26, maintains he is 'innocent' of attacking his victim in a Rhyl hotel room in 2011 because he believes the sex was consensual. Evans has successfully applied to the Criminal Cases Review Commission to have his 2012 conviction re-examined, but sent a new bundle of evidence to them on Friday. A statement on his website today said: 'Further detailed submissions - supported by previously unavailable fresh evidence that we believe strengthens Ched's application - were lodged with the Commission.' His solicitor has told MailOnline today that he is confident that the disgraced former Sheffield United striker will be cleared. Shaun Draycott said: 'We have fresh evidence that has been submitted late last week. 'We feel it is a strong case and I remain deeply concerned about Ched's conviction and we are hopeful that his application will lead to his case being referred to the Court of Appeal. 'But I cannot discuss the details of the application only to say it is very detailed and builds on the evidence submitted last July and includes fresh evidence'. The footballer's legal team has handed its latest file of evidence to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which considers if convictions are unsafe. If they believe there is a case they then refer it to the Court of Appeal where judges will consider whether to overturn the conviction  or order a retrial. This process could take up to a year to complete meaning Evans is unlikely to return to football before 2016 if he is cleared. MailOnline understands that Evans’ fresh submission may be connected to evidence not used at his trial by the prosecution that may have helped his case if it had been disclosed to the defence at the time. The Criminal Cases Review Commission has confirmed it has received the new legal bundle but would not discuss the case. Evans was released from prison last October after completing half of a five-year jail sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman. The Welsh striker denied rape, saying the sex was consensual, but he was found guilty by a jury at Caernarfon Crown Court. Support: Since his release from jail last year Evans has become engaged to his girlfriend Natasha Massey, who has stood by him throughout his trial and conviction . The prosecution said the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was too drunk to consent to sexual intercourse. Ched Evans has a website run by supporters and sets out why the footballer believes he is innocent . The woman was raped his victim in a Rhyl Premier Inn in 2012 after his footballer friend Clayton McDonald, who was cleared of rape, texted Evans on the way there saying: 'I've got a bird'. McDonald had sex with the victim, before Evans arrived and raped her, as two others filmed it through the window. After his release from jail his old club Sheffield United, who used to pay him £20,000-a-week, agreed to let him train with them. But the League One club was plunged into crisis when three patrons quit, fans threatened a boycott and its main sponsor warned it would scrap their deal if they tried to sign him. The club's bosses were accused of 'dragging the club through the mud' for bringing the 25-year-old back to training this week. Sky TV presenter Charlie Webster resigned her role as club patron in protest followed by Lindsay Graham and sixties pop star Dave Berry. Outrage: Sky TV presenter Charlie Webster, pictured with actor Allen Leech, resigned her role as club patron and Jessica Ennis-Hill said she wanted her name pulled off a stand if Evans signed for Sheffield United . Miss Webster, who was abused as a child herself, said: 'At no point have Sheffield United acknowledged the extremity of his crime. I don't believe a convicted rapist as in Ched Evans should go back to a club I am a patron of'. Olympic heptathlon champion and Blades fan Jessica Ennis-Hill then issued a statement announcing that she has told United she would want her name removed from the Bramall Lane stand should Evans be offered a contract to play for the club. Earlier this month he finally apologised to the woman he raped for the first time after a deal to sign for Oldham Athletic collapsed at the last minute. Oldham became the fourth club to turn down the chance to sign the former Wales and Sheffield United striker, and Evans blamed 'mob rule'. He said in a statement: 'Whilst I continue to maintain my innocence, I wish to make it clear that I wholeheartedly apologise for the effects that night in Rhyl has had on many people, not least the woman concerned'. May 2011 Ched Evans arrested on suspicion of sexual assault at a Premier Inn near Rhyl, North Wales. Evans and fellow footballer Clayton McDonald are later charged with rape. April 2012: Evans is jailed for five years for rape and McDonald is acquitted. Evans' lawyers announce he is to appeal against his conviction. August 2012: The first stage of Evans' appeal is rejected after a judge had refuses his application for leave to appeal against his conviction. He is released by Sheffield United. November 5 2012: Nine people plead guilty to revealing the identity of Evans' victim online with some of the comments calling her names like 'money grabbing whore' and 'poor little victim'. November 6 2012: Evans loses his appeal after his case is rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in London. April 2014: An online petition is launched urging United not to re-sign Evans and gains over 165,000 signatures. October 17 2014: Evans is released from prison after serving half his sentence and a statement is released on his website stating he will continue to fight to clear his name. October 19 2014: The Criminal Cases Review Commission confirm they are to fast-track Evans' case to investigate whether his conviction will be referred to the Court of Appeal. November 11 2014: Sheffield United confirm Evans will return to train with the club with immediate effect following a request from the Professional Footballers' Association. Television presenter Charlie Webster stands down as a patron of Sheffield United. November 12 2014: Two more patrons resign and Olympic heptathlon champion and Blades fan Jessica Ennis-Hill issues a statement announcing that she has told United she would want her name removed from the Bramall Lane stand should Evans be offered a contract to play for the club. November 14 2014: Police begin an investigation into rape threat tweets directed at Ennis-Hill after her statement over Evans. November 20 2014: Sheffield United announce they have retracted the offer for Evans to train with the club. November 27 2014: Tranmere chairman Mark Palios turns down an offer to sign Evans .

"A woman who spent years avoiding nights out because she felt frumpy next to her friends has lost nearly 6st to be named 'Miss Slinky 2015'. At her heaviest Zoe Jones, 27, from Pontypridd, Wales, dreaded getting dressed up and would make excuses to stay home instead of socialising. Now she's dropped four dress sizes, going from a size 18 to a ten, and has been awarded the national title by weight-loss organisation Slimming World. Scroll down for video . Zoe Jones reached a 15st while at university in Cardiff but after now she's a svelte  9st and a slender size 10 . She had always been a little bigger than her friends but piled on more weight both during her time at Cardiff University and afterwards when she left home for good. Zoe says that when it came to catering for herself she would often resort to convenient but unhealthy options. 'When I moved out of my mum and dad's house into my own place, I found cooking for one tricky and would usually end up eating something made from a ready-made sauce that was enough for at least two people.' 'Then boredom would set in and I'd spend my evenings lounging in front of the TV grazing on crisps and sweets. I was stuck in a rut.' She soon became insecure with the way she looked and began to avoid social situations. 'I used to come up with every excuse in the book not to join my friends on nights out because, while I loved spending time with them, I hated how I looked and felt.' Zoe made it her New Year's resolution to fit into a size 10 so she ditched cakes and biscuits to reach her goal . Zoe became so embarrassed about her appearance that she chose to avoid nights out with friends . In July 2013, after confiding in her father how unhappy she was about her size, Zoe became determined to make a change. 'My poor mum and dad bore the brunt of my bad moods. I was really insecure about my appearance, I'd get upset easily and my confidence was at an all-time low. 'Talking to my dad that day made me realise that the only thing standing in my way when it came to doing something about my weight was me.' Just days later Zoe joined her mum Helen at their local Slimming World group in Church Village in Mid Glamorgan run by consultant Jo Green. Although Zoe had tried losing weight through the organisation before, she was determined that this time she would make a permanent change. 'I'd been to several Slimming World groups in the past and lost around a stone each time, but I never made a long-term commitment to it. 'This time was different. I wasn't just going to go to the group to get weighed, I knew I needed the help and support of Jo and the other members to reach my target. Zoe now loves going shopping for new outfits, joining her friends on nights out and is now a keen runner . 'There are so many characters in our group and I found I loved getting to know everyone, even now that I'm at my target weight I still go each week. I always leave with a different recipe or piece of advice from someone in the group.' Zoe, who works as a contracts coordinator for her family's business, began following the club's Food Optimising healthy eating plan, and replaced store-bought dinners with home-cooked meals made from scratch including chilli con carne and Thai curries. She's now expanded her cooking skills and  regularly tries new recipes. 'I've always liked cooking but I used to make cakes and biscuits. Nowadays I enjoy experimenting with savoury recipes and I love that with Slimming World you can always find a healthy alternative for whatever you fancy. 'I cook for my friends and family a lot – they always ask for the recipes afterwards.' Zoe says that despite her change of diet she is still able to enjoy the odd indulgence from time to time. Zoe is 2015's Miss Slinky, a prize given to the female slimmer who's had the most inspirational transformation . 'I think it's been important for me that I can still have treats too, whether it's a glass of wine with the girls or some chocolate at Christmas, so I never feel like I can't live my life or like I'm missing out.' As well as changing her eating habits, Zoe took up running and started attending Pilates classes. 'Before I lost weight it never occurred to me to do any real sort of activity. To be honest even the gentlest of exercise would probably have been a struggle. 'I feel like a different person now. I have bucket loads more energy and I love putting on my fluorescents and going for a run on an evening. Me and my best friend Emma completed the Cardiff half marathon in October – I couldn't stop smiling after I crossed the finish line.' Since first joining Slimming World Zoe's lost a total of 5st 12lbs, dropping from 15st 7½lb to 9st 9½lb. Now she's been named the club's Miss Slinky 2015, an award for the female slimmer who's had the most inspirational transformation, both inside and out. Zoe says that she is thrilled with her new slender figure and now enjoys hunting for new outfits and regulary goes out with her friends. Breakfast: Nothing . Mid-morning: Chocolate bar or biscuits . Lunch: Shop-bought sandwich with mayonnaise, packet of crisps and chocolate bar or chocolate muffin . Mid-afternoon: Biscuits or whatever treats were brought into the office, such as cakes from the local bakery .

I still can't believe it when I go shopping and gorgeous crop tops, skinny jeans and slinky dresses fit me. 'Now I love dressing up and the girls know they can rely on me to be first on the dance floor. I finally feel like a normal 27-year-old and I'm loving it, in fact I joke I'm reliving my teenage years!' She added that she is still in shock at the difference she has been able to make both to her body and her confidence. 'The Christmas before I joined Slimming World I wrote down some dream goals, like New Year's resolutions, one of which was to fit into a size 10.' 'It's amazing to think this January I've achieved that. I used to feel invisible and want to hide away but not any more, after winning this award I want to show people that if I can do it they can too.

"The Will It Blend? campaign has destroyed iPhones, paintballs and even a bottle of Old Spice but its latest video takes the experiment to another level. Host Tom Dickson put a string of magnetic toys known as Buckyballs inside a blender. As the blades hit the strong magnets, sparks are seen flying through the blender and smoke turns the air inside it black. Scroll down for video . The strong magnets, known as Buckyballs are made using neodymium - a rare earth element. They were blended by Will it Blend? host Tom Dickson from Utah-based blender firm Blendtec (pictured) Buckyballs are made from a rare earth element called neodymium. A typical magnet is formed when unpaired spinning electrons line up to a magnetic field. In a neodymium atom there are seven of these unpaired electrons around each atom, and when it is used with in an alloy with iron and boron, for example, a small powerful magnet is produced.

In a neodymium atom there are seven of these unpaired electrons around each atom, and when it is used with in an alloy with iron and boron, for example, a small powerful magnet is produced. Between 2009 and July last year, more than 1,700 swallowing incidents were linked to the high-powered magnets. The manufacturer recalled the balls in 2012 and offered full and partial refunds. Buckyballs are no longer in production, and federal law in the US bans them from being sold. In the video, Mr Dickson blends the balls for almost a minute. Sparks begin to fly within seconds, and gradually make the blender glow a bright orange. At the end of the video, Mr Dickson tips the balls out in a solid black lump. He also describes how much dust was produced by the blending. Professor Malcolm Levitt, head of Magnetic Resonance for Chemistry at the University of Southampton told MailOnline: 'The sparks are caused by frictional heating, just as for a screeching brake. 'The hard blender blades strike sparks as they cut into the metal balls. 'The metal fragments are strongly magnetic so stick to each other forming a solid mass at the end.' The reason that sparks are produced is particularly down to the fact neodymium oxidises in air. As Kevin O'Grady, professor of physics at the University of York, explained: 'In fact, neodymium and similar metals are the basis of of flints.

Since 2006, Mr Dickson has blended marbles, golf balls, light bulbs, iPhones and iPods, glow sticks and a Justin Bieber doll. He has been criticised for the dangerous stunts, and all videos are caveated with a 'do not try this at home' warning.

Stefan Djokovic was born in October last year, four months after Djokovic and his wife tied the knot following the tennis champion's Wimbledon win. Unable to refrain from cracking a joke or two, the star delighted the crowds and his coach with his usual quit wit following the Wednesday victory. Asked about whether  his coach Boris Becker's temporary absence from his seat  during the game concerned him, Djokovic replied: 'Let me think of how I'm going to answer this question.' 'Like everyone he has a need to go to the toilet which I understand. But not in the first game or the third set Boris, please.' He added in jest, 'but in the moment I had a break point and I thought he was guilty for me not using that break point.' Djokovic is now set to face defending champion Stan Wawrinka  in the semi-finals on Friday after Wawrinka continued his impressive title defence with a straight-sets win over Japan's Kei Nishikori in the quarter-finals. Djokovic beat Wawrinka 12-10 in the fifth set in a fourth-round clash before claiming his third straight title in 2013, but Wawrinka ended the world No 1's 25-match unbeaten run in Melbourne in the quarter-finals last year, winning 9-7 in the fifth.

'We always ask from each other the most of our own abilities on the court so I am looking forward to it.' Djokovic, who has not dropped a set on the way to the semi-finals and only lost his serve once, added: 'It was a great performance, definitely no complaints.

'I was a little bit defensive but I am happy to get through.' Asked about his approach to the tournament in an on-court interview, Wawrinka added: 'I don't come back to defend, I don't come back to win again. I come back to start a new grand slam .

"Ten Roman Catholic priests in Spain have been charged with sexually abusing altar boys after the Pope was contacted by an alleged victim. The priests, as well as two Catholic lay workers, are suspected of abusing four teenage boys between 2004 and 2007- with the most serious offences taking place in a house used by the clerics. The alleged abuse came to light after one of the victims, now 24, wrote to the Pope to say he had been molested when he was an altar boy. Archbishop of Granada Francisco Javier Martinez and priests prostrate themselves in front of the altar to seek pardon for sexual abuse in the Church at the cathedral in Granada, southern Spain . Pope Francis has personally telephoned the man  to offer his apologies, Spanish news site Religion Digital reported. The head of the Catholic Church then ordered an investigation. Several arrests were made in November but the suspects are now free on bail. If convicted they could each be facing more than 20 years of jail time. The Archbishop of Granada, Francisco Javier Martinez, and fellow priests prostrated themselves in front of the altar of Granada's cathedral to seek pardon for sexual abuse in the Church at the time of the arrests. The Archbishop also removed several priests linked to the case from their duties. A man, believed to be one of twelve Roman Catholic priests and Catholic lay persons charged with sexual abuse, sits in a police car after leaving a police station in Granada, southern Spain, November 24 . Archbishop of Granada Francisco Javier Martinez (pictured) speaks during a mass at the cathedral in Granada, southern Spain after the priests were arrested last November as part of the child sexual abuse case . The victim who appealed for help to the Pope claimed the abuse started when he was 14 and continued up to the age of 17. It is alleged that the boy and a friend, who had served as altar boys in the Diocese of Granada, were invited by a priest to spend time at his parochial house and another property in a suburb of Granada,  where the most serious assaults were committed. Abuse survivors have criticised the Church which they claim has failed to punish senior officials accused of covering up scandals in several countries over many years. Pope Francis has promised a policy of zero tolerance for sexual abuse of children by clerics and last year asked for forgiveness for the Church from victims. The Vatican said last year it had defrocked about 850 priests between 2004 and 2013 who had been accused of sexually abusing minors. The Archbishop and priests prostrated themselves after Pope Francis received a letter from an alleged victim of child abuse and instigated an investigation .","Ten Roman Catholic priests in Spain have been charged with sex abuse .

"President Barack Obama . says he's declining to meet with Benjamin Netanyahu during the . Israeli leader's visit to the United States in March because it . would be 'inappropriate' for him to meet with the prime minister two weeks before an election in that . country. Netanyahu's trip has become a diplomatic sore point with . political overtones on both sides. House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, invited the Israeli prime . minister to address Congress without informing the White House . or congressional Democrats. Originally scheduled for February, the White House first said Obama would consider meeting with the foreign head state. But after Boehner acquiesced to a request from Netanyahu to move the speech to March 3 so that he could the annual American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) conference in Washington, D.C., a spokesperson for the president's National Security Council said a reunion was no longer on the table. President Barack Obama says he won't meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he visits the U.S. in March because it would be 'inappropriate' two weeks before Israel's election . A meeting so close to Israel's March 17 election could be . seen as helping Netanyahu. 'I'm declining to meet with him simply because our general . policy is we don't meet with any world leader two weeks before . their election,' Obama said in an excerpt of a CNN interview with Fareed Zakaria released on Wednesday. 'I think that's inappropriate, and that's true with some of . our closest allies,' the Democratic president told Zakaria after pointing out that he speaks with Netanyahu 'all the time.' Obama said he met with British Prime Minister David . Cameron in an election year because he scheduled his recent visit to Washington far enough away from . his country's election so 'that it doesn't look like in some . ways we're meddling or putting our thumbs on the scale.' The U.S. president wouldn't comment on Boehner's invitation or Netayahu's decision to accept it, saying he'd leave that aspect for the two leaders to sort out. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has said both men's actions were 'inappropriate,' however, and the Obama's spokesman said Boehner's speech violate normal 'protocol,' Netanyahu's trip comes amid delicate negotiations . between world powers and Iran over its nuclear program. Some . U.S. lawmakers, Democratic and Republican, have embraced . Israel's skepticism on the talks and want to impose additional . economic sanctions on Tehran. A group of Senate Democrats sent Obama a letter on Tuesday saying they would hold off on pushing for sanctions for two months. Netanyahu, whose relations with Obama are strained, has . defended his planned speech as a moral obligation and a . strategic necessity. He said on Sunday his priority was to urge . the United States and other powers not to negotiate an Iranian . nuclear deal that might endanger Israel. 'Our general policy is we don't meet with any world leader two weeks before their election,' Obama said in an excerpt of a CNN interview with Fareed Zakaria released on Wednesday . The Obama administration has said negotiations are crucial . to maintaining pressure on Tehran and hopefully achieve a . breakthrough by the end of June. 'For us to undermine diplomacy at this critical time for no . good reason is a mistake,' Obama said in the CNN interview. Obama said he hadn't yer heard a 'persuasive rebuttal' to his argument that the current sanctions regime was created to force Iran into diplomatic negotiations. So far, he said, Iran hasn't violated an interim agreement. 'We have lost nothing during this period of negotiations,' he said, yet we have a 'chance' at making sure Iran doesn't develop a nuclear weapon. The U.S. president again promised to veto any legislation that calls for new sanctions on Iran before talks have concluded and reiterated a commitment to further punish Iran 'the day after' it walks away from a 'reasonable' deal. With Republicans now in control of the Senate, what makes the administration so sure that any deal it approves would also get the green light from the upper chamber. 'I think it's important for us to actually have a deal in place, and then make an argument for what the deal is,' Obama said, restating his position that he would take 'no deal over a bad deal.' If he were to come to the Senate with a deal scientists say would stop Iran from becoming nuclear capable and Republicans still weren't on board, Obama said a public debate would ensue in which he would ask Members of Congress why they would 'prefer a potential military option that would be less effective in constraining Iran's nuclear program and would have extraordinary ramifications at a time when we've already got too many conflicts in the Middle East.' 'And I'm pretty confident I can win that argument,' he added.","'Our general policy is we don't meet with any world leader two weeks before their election,' Obama told CNN .

"Dubai has overtaken London’s Heathrow as the world’s busiest international airport as the Gulf city emerges as a major hub for long-haul flights between Asia and the West. Dubai International Airport said 70.5 million international passengers streamed through its terminals last year, a six per cent increase over the 66.4 million travellers it handled in 2013. Now that it has passed Heathrow for the first time on a full-year basis, the world’s top international travel hub said it expects a further surge in traveller numbers in 2015. Dubai International Airport said 70.5 million international passengers streamed through its terminals last year . Dubai International has seen steady growth while emerging as a major hub for long-haul flights . Heathrow narrowly lost its crown, reporting 68.1 million international passengers in 2014. But it remains ahead of Dubai in terms of overall passengers when domestic flights are factored in. With domestic flights included Heathrow topped out at 73.4 million passengers in 2014, about three million more than Dubai. But Heathrow has struggled to grow and is competing with Gatwick Airport for the right to build a new runway. A Heathrow spokeswoman said: ‘Britain has benefited from being home to the world's largest port or airport for the last 350 years. But lack of capacity at Heathrow means we have inevitably lost our crown to Dubai.’ Dubai International CEO Paul Griffiths said the airport will handle a record 79 million passengers in 2015 . Dubai International's annual capacity will increase to 90 million passengers when a new concourse opens . Dubai International Airport’s surge in traffic reflects its rapid expansion and the efforts of luxury Gulf carriers Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways to seize a significant portion of travel between the West, Asia and Australasia, and lure customers with the introduction of wider-bodied aircraft, including the world’s largest fleet of Airbus A380 superjumbo jets. Dubai serves as the base for Emirates, the largest carrier in the Middle East. Flights to and from Western Europe saw the biggest passenger growth in Dubai, followed closely by destinations in the Indian subcontinent, Asia and North America. In a statement Dubai Airports chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum said: ‘This historic milestone is the culmination of over five decades of double-digit average growth. ‘The shared goal is to make Dubai a global centre of aviation and we are nearing that goal.’ Heathrow has struggled to grow and is competing with Gatwick Airport for the right to build a new runway . When domestic flights are factored in Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport remains the busiest . Paul Griffiths, the airport’s CEO, said Dubai International will handle a record 79 million passengers in 2015. The airport’s traffic grew last year even though it had to redirect flights to the city’s second airport, Al-Maktoum International, while it overhauled its side-by-side runways for nearly three months. Al-Maktoum International opened in 2013 and will have a capacity of 120 million travellers when completed in 2022. Dubai International plans to boost its annual capacity to 90 million passengers this year with the opening of a new hall for arrivals and departures as part of a $7.8bn expansion plan (approximately £5bn). The airport and Emirates are owned by Dubai’s government. While Dubai is tops for international travel, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport remains the busiest passenger airport overall.","Dubai airport said it handled 70.5 million international passengers in 2014 .

"A new study - the first to include people aged over 80 - found a third of older people still enjoy 'frequent' sex at least twice a month (file picture) Age is no barrier to an active love life, research shows. For among the over-70s, more than half of men and almost a third of women say they are still sexually active. Of these, one in three say they have sex at least twice a month. The University of Manchester study was the first of its kind to include men and women aged 80-plus. It also found that love and affection stand the test of time, with many in their 70s and 80s saying they still indulge in frequent kissing. Researchers did not examine why older men tend to be more sexually active than women, but it may be that they are more likely to have a younger partner. A woman’s longer lifespan is also thought to be relevant, with older women more likely to be widowed and thus living alone for longer. But as women get older, they believe that quality is more important than quantity where their sex lives are concerned. For the study revealed that while women have fewer nights of passion as they get older, they enjoy them more. Researchers said this is probably because older women accept that their sex lives are not going to improve. The study of more than 6,000 English men and women aged 50-plus found that poor health and the loss of a partner are bigger obstacles to having sex than lack of desire. Researcher David Lee said: ‘We hope our findings improve public health by countering stereotypes and misconceptions about late-life sexuality, and offer older people a reference against which they may relate their own experiences and expectations.’ The study, published in the German-based journal Archives of Sexual Behavior, showed older Britons to be far from prudish about discussing their most intimate moments. Less than 3 per cent of those who took part refused to answer direct questions about their sex lives. Dr Lee said GPs should not be shy about broaching the subject. Researchers at the University of Manchester found more than half of men (54 per cent), and almost a third of women (31 per cent) aged over 70 said they were still sexually active (file picture posed by models) ‘A minority of older people remain sexually active but that minority is still quite a number of people who could arguably benefit from more open and equitable healthcare,’ he said. ‘Sexual health shouldn’t just be swept under the carpet.’ Caroline Abrahams, of the charity Age UK, said: ‘The fact this is the first time that people over 80 years old have been included in this kind of research highlights how often the public health needs of older people, including sexual health, are ignored or overlooked. ‘With an ageing population it is important that providers of sexual health services understand the needs of older people in both clinical settings and when developing information and advice.’","Study at University of Manchester found a third of over 70s still enjoy 'frequent' sex, at least twice a month .

"Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon today warned Alex Salmond she would be in charge of any negotiations with Labour to form a Coalition after the next election. The SNP leader, who is not standing for Westminster, dismissed suggestions Mr Salmond would act as a back seat driver if he is elected to Westminster in May. But  at a rare appearance in Westminster this afternoon Ms Sturgeon said she would 'lead the position' in any talks with other parties in the event of another hung parliament. Asked who would lead the negotiations, she replied: 'Me'. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, who is not standing for Westminster, dismissed suggestions Alex Salmond would control Coalition negotiations with Labour in the event of another hung Parliament . Pressed on what role Mr Salmond might play, she said: 'If Alex is elected - as I would be fairly confident in predicting he will be - then Alex will be a key part of the team in Westminster and, of course, will have a part to play. 'But I am the party leader, Stewart is the deputy of leader of the party, and we will lead the position.' It comes after she claimed Britain would be better run if Scottish Nationalists sat in the Cabinet with Labour. The SNP leader said the majority of Scots want Labour to have to share power after May's general election, which she said would lead to 'more progressive decisions for the whole of the UK'. She boasted that she wanted to make sure 'Scotland's voice is heard loudly at Westminster.' A string of opinion polls suggest the SNP will make big gains on May 7, robbing Ed Miliband of an overall majority and forcing him into a Westminster coalition with Miss Sturgeon's party. A huge row erupted last week when the SNP announced its MPs planned to vote on laws which only affect England, including the running of the NHS. Miss Sturgeon claimed her MPs in Westminster would take part in any votes which had an impact on Scotland, claiming the repeal of NHS reforms imposed by the Tory-Lib Dem coalition would have UK-wide repercussions. Tory defence minister Anna Soubry branded the remarks 'complete twaddle' and warned Ms Sturgeon was putting the Union at risk again. A Survation poll for the Daily Record newspaper revealed that 35.1 per cent of Scottish voters would prefer to see a deal between Labour and the SNP . The latest IpsosMORI opinion poll suggests the SNP could will an incredible 55 of Scotland's 59 seats, with Scottish Labour reduced to a rump of only four MPs - with the Tories and the Lib Dems completely wiped out . But Miss Sturgeon today vowed that the SNP will vote on English tax issues and claimed a Labour government dependent on SNP support would be fairer for the whole of the UK. She told BBC One's Andrew Marr show on Sunday: 'If you look at polls in Scotland, as well as showing a substantial SNP lead they show that the most popular outcome in Scotland in the general election is a Labour government dependent on SNP support,' she said. 'Because I think people recognise that would lead to better decisions that were not just, perhaps, in the interests of Scotland but more progressive decisions for the whole of the UK.' Miss Sturgeon, who took over as Scottish First Minister after Alex Salmond stood down, said she will also seek alliances with parties such as Plaid Cymru and the Green Party to be a 'progressive force in the House of Commons'. Scotland's First Minister met David Cameron in Scotland last week . 'I think the Westminster establishment really needs some progressive forces at its heart,' she added. 'I want Scotland to become independent, you have probably noticed that over the past wee while, but that will only happen when a majority of Scotland want that to happen. 'In the interim, what is really important is Scotland's voice is heard loudly at Westminster.' An Ipsos Mori poll for STV News last week found 52 per cent of Scots are planning to vote SNP in May. That would give the Nationalists an incredible 55 of Scotland's 59 seats, with Scottish Labour reduced to a rump of only four MPs - with the Tories and the Lib Dems completely wiped out. It would shatter Labour's hopes of an overall majority, and would leave Ed Miliband reliant on SNP votes to pass laws - including those which only affect England. Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy has not ruled out working with the SNP after the general election. But the East Renfrewshire MP said 'it would be wrong' to back the abolition of the Trident nuclear deterrent in exchange for SNP votes. His deputy Kezia Dugdale MSP she said she would 'no qualms whatsoever' about going into partnership with the SNP after the May election. Speaking on the BBC's Politics Scotland, Mr Murphy said: 'I think it's important that parties work together, it happens all across Scotland in local authorities, but what Kez is talking about is the same thing that I've been talking about which is that we're not expecting, we're not planning, we don't want, and we don't need a coalition with the SNP. 'The fact is that come the UK election here in Scotland in May it's really a choice of whether David Cameron hangs on to power or whether we can get David Cameron out of Downing Street, and by voting SNP, unfortunately, a lot of Scots if they do so, run the risk that by accident they ensure that David Cameron holds onto power.'","Sturgeon warns Salmond she will be in charge of negotiations with Labour .

"Shoppers watched in shock as a bus driver performed a one hundred and forty point turn in an narrow city street. The number 11 double-decker was on its way to the Sprowston area of Norwich when roadworks meant it had to change course. Pedestrians, drivers and even the passengers on board were left astonished as the driver shunted the vehicle back and forth to turn it around. Shopkeepers waved the driver back and forward to help him complete the manoeuvre in the city's Magdalen Street. Scroll down for video . Tight spot: A bus driver attempts to turn his vehicle around in Magdalen Street, Norwich yesterday . The incident happened yesterday following the start of work on Monday to modify a junction in the city meant the area was closed to traffic. The driver's bosses at the locally-based First firm said the driver ended up in a fix after reading 'no access for any vehicles except buses' on road signs. Chris Gosbell, owner of pawnbrokers Long's Pledge Center helped the driver try and reverse after it hit the sign outside his shop. He said: 'I went out to try and help him to make sure he didn't reverse into the building. He said thanks for helping him out. I felt for him a bit.' Local businessman Andy Manley, a director at Norwich Computers in Magdalen Street, filmed the bus as it tried to turn back down Magdalen Street. He compared the multi-point U-turn to the manoeuvre attempted by Austin Powers on a cart in the 1997 film starring Mike Myers. Tough manoeuvre: Local shopkeepers came out to wave the man back and forth as he tried to turn around . On route: After more than three minutes spent turning around the number 11 bus was finally free to move off . Mr Manley said 'There was another car turning round and the bus came over to the left, turned round and before you knew it there were people trying to help the driver reverse it.' A spokesman for First said they will remind their drivers about the diversions in the area following yesterday's incident. 'We can confirm that one of our buses drove along Magdalen Street on Tuesday, January 27 as the diversion signs were placed to read ""No access for any vehicles except buses"". 'We issue staff notices to all of our drivers in advance of roadworks, advising them of the diversion and the diversion route. However, in instances like this, our drivers obey signage on the roads.

"More than a million people receiving treatment for asthma may have been misdiagnosed, experts warned today. Almost a third of the 4.1m people treated for asthma in the UK did not show any 'clear evidence' of the incurable condition, according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) . This means they may be receiving unnecessary treatment. However, asthma charities warned diagnosing asthma is difficult and the majority of  patients 'do not receive adequate care'. And experts cautioned that no one diagnosed with the condition should stop taking prescribed medication unless instructed by a healthcare professional. More than a million people may have been wrongly diagnosed as having asthma - and may be receiving unnecessary treatment . NICE has drafted new guidance, its first for asthma, for doctors in England to improve the accuracy of diagnoses. The guideline makes it clear that a clinical test should be carried out to diagnose asthma, as well as checking for signs and symptoms. It said the first test should be carried out using a spirometer, a machine which measures how much and how fast a person breathes out. Further breath tests should be carried out depending on the results from spirometry and the patient's age. For adults and young people over five years, an FeNO test should be carried out. This is a test which checks for levels of nitric oxide, a gas which is found in larger volumes in people with asthma. A BDR test4 which measures whether standard medicines which widen the airways of the lung are of benefit . Asthma is a common long-term condition that can cause coughing, wheezing, chest tightness and breathlessness. The severity of these symptoms varies from person to person. Asthma can be controlled well in most people most of the time, although some people may have more persistent problems. Occasionally, asthma symptoms can get gradually or suddenly worse. This is known as an 'asthma attack', although doctors sometimes use the term 'exacerbation'. Severe attacks may require hospital treatment and can be life threatening, although this is unusual. Asthma is caused by inflammation of the small tubes, called bronchi, which carry air in and out of the lungs. When a person come into contact with something that irritates the lungs – known as a trigger – the airways become narrow, the muscles around them tighten, and there is an increase in the production of sticky mucus (phlegm). The reason why some people develop asthma is not fully understood, although it is known that a person is more likely to develop it if they have a family history of the condition. Asthma can develop at any age, including in young children and elderly people. Source: NHS Choices . The treatment of children under five should be based on professional judgement and observation until the child is old enough to take clinical tests. Around 1 in 10 of adults with asthma develops the condition because they are exposed to certain substances, such as chemicals or dust, in their workplace. The draft guideline also recommends that healthcare professionals ask employed people how their symptoms are affected by work, to check if they may have occupational asthma. During each review, the healthcare professionals should check the patient is able to use their inhaler correctly and also consider using a questionnaire to get a better estimate of how well a person is doing, it added. Professor Mark Baker, director of clinical practice at NICE, said: 'Asthma is a long-term incurable condition that affects millions of people of all ages. 'If left untreated, asthma attacks can be life threatening. 'However, with appropriate treatment and thoughtful monitoring, most people will be able to successfully control their symptoms and be spared from serious harm. 'Accurate diagnosis of asthma has been a significant problem which means that people may be wrongly diagnosed or cases might be missed in others. 'Our aim with this guideline is to give clarity and set out the most clinical and cost effective ways to diagnose and monitor asthma based on the best available evidence.' Asthma is one of the world's most common long-lasting diseases in childhood, affecting 1.1m children and 4.3m adults in the UK. Around 10 per cent of the 5.4 million people in the UK with asthma have the most severe form, which leaves them unable to control their symptoms, resulting in frequent attacks, despite taking multiple high-strength medicines. Experts today highlighted the need for respiratory diseases to be diagnosed accurately. Professor Anna Murphy, a consultant pharmacist and spokesperson for the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said: ‘I think there are issues in primary care in diagnosing asthma. NICE says doctors should now carry out clinical test as well as observations in order to diagnose asthma. The  first test should be carried out using a spirometer, a machine which measures how much and how fast a person breathes out (pictured) 'We need to do a thorough history and do objective tests to confirm the findings we suspect. ‘Unfortunately we’re often not doing these tests and so people are being misdiagnosed. ‘Getting the diagnosis right before we get suggest treatment for any disease is important. ‘If we're given asthma treatment for breathlessness and it’s not working, it could be that the person has COPD, anaemia, or heart failure, which will need to be treated appropriately. ‘Other people with these conditions could slip through the net.' There aren't too many risks for people taking inhalers at the doses generally prescribed by doctors and pharmacists, she added, but as they are steroid inhalers they could induce side-effects of oral thrush and a hoarse voice. 'There’s also a cost to the NHS of wasted treatment,' she continued. However, she said asthma can be fatal and so stressed people diagnosed with the condition should not stop their treatment without the advice of a healthcare professional. 'We can’t miss the fact that people die from asthma, so I don’t want people to think “I don’t have asthma” and stop their treatment. 'It’s a variable disease which will be well-controlled at some points, but they will have symptoms such as breathlessness, coughing at night, and wheezing at other times. Experts said people misdiagnosed with asthma could actually be suffering breathlessness for a different reason, such as COPD, lung diseases anaemia or heart failure, which should be treated appropriately . 'What we would recommend for anyone with well-controlled disease, is that it’s good practice for the healthcare professional to slowly start reducing their treatments, in a controlled way, so the need less. 'They would be monitored to make sure people are safe.' Dr Nick Hopkinson, a respiratory physician and medical advisor for the British Lung Foundation echoed these concerns. He told Mailonline: ‘Tens of hundreds of thousands of people are taking inhalers they don’t need is wasteful. ‘Some people with asthma could end up with high doses of inhaled steroids, when the correct dose for them is zero.’ Commenting on the draft guideline, Kay Boycott, chief executive at Asthma UK, said: 'We welcome the NICE guideline for the improvement of asthma diagnosis in the hope that this will help people with asthma receive more personalised care. 'Asthma has many complex causes which is one of the reasons why it is sometimes difficult to get a definitive diagnosis. 'It is also a highly variable condition that can change throughout someone’s life or even week by week, meaning treatment can change over time. 'For anyone with an asthma diagnosis, it is vital they have the right medication and a plan to better manage their condition and any asthma attacks.'","NICE says there is no evidence a third of asthma patients have the disease .

Amal's boss, Geoffrey Robertson QC, is founder and head of Doughty Street Chambers. He has argued many landmark human rights cases in British and Commonwealth Courts and the European Court of Human Rights. He has defended several high-profile clients, including Salman Rushie and Julian Assange, and taken part in proceedings against General Augusto Pinochet . Mr Robertson is also the author of two books on the 1915 genocide, 'Was there an Armenian Genocide?', published in 2009, and 'An Inconvenient Genocide: Who Now Remembers the Armenians?', out last year. The killings in 1915 are regarded by many historians as the first genocide of the 20th century, and are said to have inspired Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. Turkey rejects the term ‘genocide,’ says the death figure is inflated and that people died on both sides as the Ottoman Empire collapsed amid World War I. Mrs Clooney is a barrister with the London chamber, specialising in human rights, international law, and extradition. She speaks three languages fluently - English, French and Arabic - and has represented Wikileaks founder Julian Assange and former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko. Last year, the accomplished lawyer advised Greece on how to get Britain to return the disputed Elgin Marbles. Mrs Clooney was part of a high profile legal team from London advising the Greek government on possible action in the international court to force the British Museum to hand over the marbles. Mrs Clooney’s international profile was raised last year when she married American actor George Clooney in a star-studded ceremony in Italy.

Their findings will be included in the report which is a requirement from the International . Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for Malaysia. Investigators  say they could finish scouring the priority search zone by May, more than a year after the plane vanished, if there are no delays with vessels, equipment and weather. The Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre (JACC) said decisions about the future of the search would continue to be made in collaboration between Malaysia, China and Australia. Last month, families of the 239 passengers and crew on board the flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing provided DNA samples to assist in identifying loved ones once the plane was found.

"One was a rugby-loving university student, his father was a wealthy businessman and the mother a committed stay-at-home mum who was at the heart of a 'very happy' family. Devastated friends from Australia have paid tribute to axe attack victims Martin van Breda, 55, his wife Teresa, 54, and their son Rudi, 22, whose bodies were discovered in their exclusive golf-course estate home ​at Stellenbosch, about 50km east of Cape Town on Tuesday morning. The tributes poured in this morning as Marli, 16, remains in a critical but stable condition in hospital with serious head injuries, and surviving brother Henri, 20, was questioned by police. 'You are a true blue genuine mate my friend,' said Rudi's university friend Afif Norzal, 22, who was in all of Rudi's classes at the University of Melbourne, in an online tribute. 'At times when I didn't have anyone to talk to, you would definitely make me feel the most welcome... I will always love you.' Scroll down for video . Family horror: Martin (right) and Teresa van Breda (second from right) with their daughter, Marli, 16 (front left), and sons, Henri, 20 (back left), and Rudi, 22 (back right) Marli's headmistress described her as a 'lovely, popular, clever girl' whose parents were involved in the school. The 16-year-old is in a critical condition with severe head injuries and a severed jugular . It has been reported that a 'blood-spattered axe' was found at the home where there was no sign of a break-in . Rudi van Breda (pictured left and right) has been remembered by friends as a keen sportsman. On the right, Breda is pictured horsing around with his university friend Afif Norzal . The family lived in Perth and on the Sunshine Coast before returning to South Africa in mid-2014. Family friend Retha Dutton said Rudi was visiting his parents and siblings before he was set to return to university for his final year of his Masters of Engineering. 'He was one of those guys - me being from a different culture - he was one of the first friends who genuinely connected with me,' Mr Norzal told Daily Mail Australia in an interview. 'He was one of those people when he talked to you, you genuinely knew this guy wanted to be your mate.' 'He was a really chilled and laidback person. He never stressed about anything.' Mr Norzal, from Malaysia, described the family as 'loving'. He graduated from Trinity College in 2011 and completed a Bachelor of Science at the university in 2013. In a statement, a spokesman for the University of Melbourne told Daily Mail Australia: 'A Dean’s honors list member for Science in 2011, Rudi was a keen sportsman and was highly regarded amongst his peers as a good-natured and friendly person, someone who was always willing to lend a hand and help out younger students.' Henri returned to South Africa with his parents in mid-214. He had been living with his brother at Trinity College while studying at the University of Melbourne in 2013. Both attended Scotch College in Perth. 'Teresa was a lovely mother,' Ms Dutton told Daily Mail Australia. 'She was so happy all her children were with her, the boys had came from Australia (to visit). 'Henri moved back to South Africa in the middle of last year and he stayed with his family. She loved having him with her. She always used to tell me how wonderful it was.' Family patriarch Martin was the managing director of Engel and Voelkers Australia, an international property firm which has offices in Perth and Queensland. Friends described him as a 'great man' with a bright future ahead of him. '(He) was going to change SA (South Africa),' Peter Armitage tweeted. 'Folks, live for today. Tell people you love them today.' Mr Armitage said Martin was the founder of Netstar and Woodhill College. Martin's golf club paid their 'deepest condolences' to the family on Twitter. A friend and colleague at Engel and Voelker, Paul Freney, told Daily Mail Australia he and his wife Teresa, who was a stay and home mum, were committed parents to their three children. Tragedy: The van Breda family had just moved back to South Africa in June after six years in Perth, Western Australia . Popular: Rudi Van Breda was popular with his friends at Trinity College and the University of Melbourne . Brother and sister: Rudi, 22, was killed during the attack, while Marli, right, remains in a critical but stable condition in a South African hospital . 'I heard about it yesterday. A mate of mine rang me up and I nearly fell off my chair,' Mr Freney said. 'They were very nice people. Martin loved his rugby. He was an avid Force supporter from Western Australia. 'We used to go to the rugby together, he loved his golf.' 'Teresa... looked after the business of running the home and all that sort of stuff, and I imagine had a fair bit to do.' 'He was a very intelligent man and he was obviously very wealthy, had a lot of money, but it was all earned through his own endeavours.' The van Bredas had spent several years living in the Perth suburb of Claremont. Around 2012 they moved to the Sunshine Coast, where Engels and Volker had an office. Ms Dutton, whose daughter is close friends with Marli, said she last saw the family on January 2 in South Africa. She said they were a 'very, very happy family'. Marli was enrolled at Matthew Flinders Anglican College at Buderim while she was in Year 9. A school spokesman said the community was 'very sad to hear the tragic news'. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with Marli, her family and those who love her,' the spokesman said. She is currently a student Somerset College in South Africa. A close family friend described the van Breda's as 'like a perfect family' The van Breda family lived on the estate of the De Zalze Golf Club (pictured) about 50km east of Cape Town . The school's headmistress Meg Fargher, described the Year 11 student as a  'lovely, popular, clever girl' whose parents were very involved in the school, news24 reported. Both schools are providing access to counsellors for students. Emergency medical services spokesman Robert Daniels told reporters it was obvious that the victims were attacked with an axe. 'What I can say is they were not shot, the patients were axed,' Mr Daniels told the Cape Times. 'The daughter was rushed to hospital with severe head trauma and a severed jugular. He said Henri was treated at the scene for minor bruises on his arms. Family friend Alexander Boshoff, 19, described the Van Bredas' as a 'typical happy family', according to South African news reports. 'Our families often spent holidays together. We have known each other for years,' he said. Mr Boshoff said the family moved around a lot due to Martin's work but the boys never complained and then added that they were 'like a perfect family'.

"During this Sunday's Super Bowl, for the first time ever, the National Football League will air a commercial that deals with the horrors of domestic violence head-on. The 60-second spot is part of the NFL's ongoing affiliation with No More - a coalition of groups dedicated to fighting domestic abuse - and is a dramatization based on a real 911 phone call in which a female victim appeals for help by pretending to order a pizza. No characters or scenes of violence are shown on the video. Instead, audio of the chilling call is played as the camera pans around the victim’s home, which shows signs of a recent altercation: like a fist-shaped hole in the wall and a smashed photo frame. Dark: At this Sunday's Super Bowl, for the first time ever, the NFL will air a commercial (pictured) that deals with the horrors of domestic violence head-on . The NFL donated the airtime for the spot and paid Grey, a New York ad agency, to produce it. It will air during the first quarter of Sunday's game, as part of the football league's ongoing effort to take a stand against domestic violence - a contentious subject given a string of recent scandals regarding some of its players. In the spot, a woman calls 911 and tells the operator her address, immediately before saying she'd like to order a large pizza. Eerie: No characters or scenes of violence appear, simply a dramatized voiceover based on a real 911 phone call in which a female victim appeals for help by pretending to order a pizza . 'Ma'am you've reached 911 - this is an emergency line,' the operator responds, but the woman pushes on, insisting she'd like to order a pepperoni and mushroom pizza and asking nervously, 'do you know how long it will be? The operator, catching on, asks if the woman is actually having an emergency, to which she curtly responds, 'yes.' 'Is there someone in the room with you?' asks the operator. 'Yes', the woman responds. The operator then informs the caller that help is on its way, before she hastily hangs up and the commercial ends with the line: 'When it's hard to talk, it's up to us to listen.' Amid the flurry of high-octave Super Bowl ads starring beer, cute puppies and scantily-clad women, No More's tense spot is likely to stand out by a mile. Home: As the woman speaks in code to the operator under the guise of ordering the pizza, we see signs of an altercation including a fist-shaped hole in the wall (left) and a smashed photo frame (right) According to Ad Week, the commercial will also run on digital channels and get promotion from celebrity supporters. The pre-release of No More's spot comes just weeks after the Baltimore Ravens reached a settlement in the disturbing domestic violence case that led to football star Ray Rice's suspension from the game. While the terms of the settlement have not been released, Mr Rice had been seeking more than $3.5 million for wrongful termination. The three-time Pro Bowl running back was released from the team after footage of him knocking out wife Janay Rice - then his fiancee - in an elevator was released publicly by gossip site TMZ in September. United front: Ray Rice (pictured arriving at court with his wife Janay Rice on November 5) and reached a settlement with The Baltimore Ravens over his termination from the team earlier this month . Shocking footage: The footballer was suspended from the NFL indefinitely after he was filmed punching Mrs Rice with his left fist in an elevator at an Atlantic City casino (pictured) Brutal: Elevator surveillance cameras caught the moment that Mr Rice punched his then-fiancee in the face in an Atlantic City casino elevator leaving her sprawled out on the floor . The brutal assault saw Mr Rice dragging his fiancee out of the elevator, sparked national outrage and highlighted the often overlooked issue of domestic violence in the NFL. However,  months after the assault, Baltimore Ravens President Dick Cass said it is now time 'to turn the page' on the incident. The NFL is still keen to show it is against domestic abuse, saying it will  continue its work within the community on the issue of intimate partner abuse. Mr Rice became a free agent earlier this month after former federal judge Barbara S. Jones overturned NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's indefinite suspension and reinstated him. But he hasn't yet drawn interest from any teams. In December, Mr Rice chose a Christmas fundraiser collecting toys for needy children for his first public appearance since the video of him knocking out his wife in an elevator was released. On the field: During his appeal, Mr Rice's lawyers and the union argued the league had overstepped its authority in modifying the player's (pictured) two-game suspension, saying he was being 'sentenced' twice . The 27-year-old attended the Toys for Tots fundraiser, held at the Jimmy's Famous Seafood restaurant in Dundalk. During an interview, Mr Rice said, 'it feels good to be out and among the Baltimore community and just to give back'. He also addressed the aggravated assault charges laid against him last year. 'I made a horrible mistake in my life, but, you know, if you truly believe in second chances, you know, they will forgive me,' Mr Rice told CBS Baltimore. 'We wish Janay and Ray Rice the best,' Mr Cass said. Ruling: NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell (left) had his decision overturned by former federal judge Barbara S. Jones, making Mr Rice (right) a free agent . More: There have been a spate of additional abuse cases among players including Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson (left) and Indianapolis Colts linebacker Joshua McNary (right) Since the Mr Rice incident brought the issue of abuse to the fore, there have been a spate of similarly shocking incidents with other NFL players. Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson, created a storm of controversy after he admitted to hitting his son with a switch. And earlier this month, Indianapolis Colts linebacker Joshua McNary denied allegations that he raped a woman at his apartment after the pair met during an evening of heavy drinking in early December. Mr McNary was taken into police custody earlier this month after charges of rape, criminal confinement with bodily injury and battery resulting in bodily injury were filed against him.","The ad will show after the first quarter of Sunday's Big Game, with its airtime donated by the NFL .

"Crazed man: Alleged suspect Phillip Roberts was arrested for stabbing a woman with a screwdriver . A woman was stabbed from behind with a screwdriver by a crazed man while she was walking on the treadmill at 24 Hour Fitness on Tuesday morning. Officers were first called to the gym in Irving, Texas when witnesses spotted a man, later identified as 32-year-old Phillip Roberts, wearing a trench coat and carrying a suitcase acting suspiciously. Irving Police Spokesman James McLellan told NBC that officers were informed by gym staff that the 'suspicious' character was working out at the gym with a guest membership and that they'd seen him at that location with his suitcase before. 20 minutes later officers were called back at the scene because Roberts had allegedly stabbed a woman in the back with a Philips head screwdriver in a random attack. 'Her scream was so loud, even when I had the music on, I could hear her yell, and it really sounded like she was scared for her life,' said gym member Yvette Perez. 'I mean, I can only imagine. DailyMail.com spoke with witness Justin Harper who saw the stabbing unravel before his eyes. Harper, a former police officer for the Blue Mound Police Department, was working out just feet away from the incident. 'It took a little while to figure out the woman was being attacked,' Harper told DailyMail.com. Scroll down for video . Frequent member: The victim worked out at this 24 Hour Fitness on a regular basis and she did not know her alleged attacker nor was he a member . Intervened: Witness and former officer Justin Harper saw the stabbing and he tackled the crazed suspect to the ground before more officers arrived . 'I noticed a lady who looked like she was falling off a treadmill and I noticed a black male - looked like he was grabbing her, and I thought he was helping her, but then he starts hitting her,' Harper told NBC. 'They fell down right in front of my treadmill where I was at so when I saw him start hitting her. Then another guy came by and we both tackled him to the ground,' he continued. Harper says Roberts did not know the suspect and that he seemed as though he had mental issues. 'When we tackled him to the ground and he didn't say a word. He had a crazed glazed over look in his eyes,' Harper told DailyMail.com. Screams : Witness Yvette Perez said the woman screamed very loudly as though she 'feared for her life' As soon as officers arrived on the scene that's when Harper noticed that the man had a particularly dull Philips head screwdriver with him. The victim's husband told reporters he feels blessed that Harper along with another witness was there to intervene until more police arrived. The woman, whose identity has not been released, suffered non-life-threatening puncture wounds to her back and shoulder and was taken to a hospital in Dallas where she is receiving treatment. Harper said that when Roberts was asked by police why he allegedly attacked the woman he said that she just 'popped into his head,' and later went on to say that she 'was bothering him.' Roberts was transferred to the Dallas County Jail late Tuesday evening and will be charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Harper says that Roberts was 'aggressive and started fighting people.' Police are continuing to investigate the stabbing .","Phillip Roberts, 32,  allegedly stabbed a woman as she ran on a treadmill .

"The deadly fire at a Annapolis mansion that killed a couple and their four grandchildren was caused by a 15-foot dry Christmas tree,  investigators revealed today.

"The Islamic State has released the first pictures of its own sniper battalion in what appears to be propaganda to answer the  hit US film, American Sniper. Bearded as well as clean-shaven members of the eight-man unit are pictured posing with long-range Russian-made Dragunov sniper rifles in northern Iraq. Adopting the look of an American sniper unit, the fighters are kitted out in khaki uniforms, peaked caps and ski goggles to protect them from the glare of the sun.

They have also played a prominent role in the battle for Kobane which involved intense street fighting. ISIS Twitter accounts were quick to link the battalion to a famous Iraqi sniper who plagued American forces during the Iraqi conflict. One said the unit was carrying on the legacy of 'Juba the Sniper', a Sunni insurgent sniper who operated in Baghdad from 2005 where he is said to have killed around 40 American soldiers. The film American Sniper is directed by Clint Eastwood and based on Chris Kyle's autobiography American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in US Military History. With 255 kills, 160 of which were officially confirmed by the Department of Defense, Kyle is the deadliest marksman in US military history. But the film, which stars Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller, includes a character named Mustafa, shown as a rival to Bradley Cooper's portrayal of Chris Kyle, undoubtedly based on Juba. A shadowy figure, Juba claimed to be a soldier in the Sunni insurgent  Islamic Army in Iraq (IAI) - which included former members of Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath Party, his intelligence services and officers of the Republican Guard. Armed and dangerous: Islamic State snipers have seen action in both Iraq and Syria, where they have killed both Kurdish and Iraqi fighters . His skills with a rifle reportedly allowed him to hit targets from 200 metres away. Videos of Juba's exploits were seen at the time as an important step in the development of the insurgents' propaganda and their ability to personalise the killing of coalition soldiers - a radical departure from earlier clips of the IED explosions and random car bombs that had been the hallmark of the insurgency. His videos also included direct threats and then-U.S. President George W, Bush. 'I have nine bullets in this gun and I have a present for George Bush,' Juba tells the camera in one video. 'I am going to kill nine people.' In the close-quarter urban combat of Baghdad and Fallujah, exposed US soldiers were known to be highly vulnerable to sniper attacks and stories of a skilled marksman hunting them in the labyrinthine backstreets of Iraq's cities  took its toll on the American troops' psyche. 'He's good,' Specialist Travis Burress, a sniper based in Camp Rustamiyah near Baghdad said in 2006. 'Every time we dismount, I'm sure everyone has got him in the back of their minds. He's a serious threat to us.' 'He definitely knows what to do with a rifle,' Major John Plaster, a retired Green Beret sniper instructor, told ABC in 2006. 'He has the judgment and discipline to take a shot, wisely choose an escape route, and immediately depart to avoid capture. This is not a zealot; this is a calculated shooter.' Violent legacy: Islamic State Twitter accounts are linking the sniper battalion to a famous Iraqi sniper . Killer: One account said the unit was following in the footsteps of 'Juba the Sniper, who reportedly killed around 40 American soldiers in Baghdad from 2005 . Big guns: ISIS reportedly took possession of this giant 10-foot-long sniper rifle last year. What sort of effect this gun would have is open to debate, claim experts . He waited for soldiers to dismount or stand up in a Humvee turret, before aiming for gaps in their body armour, the lower spine, ribs or above the chest. 'The big concern is that there's a school somewhere that's ready to turn out more of these people,' former Green Beret Major John Plaster said in his 2006 ABC interview. Debates about Juba's whereabouts or his existence continue to this day. The Iraqi Interior Ministry announced in 2006 that it had captured an insurgent known as Ali Nazar al-Jubori (aka Mazer al-Jubouri), claiming he was the famed 'Iraqi sniper'. Many claim he may have not been an individual but a composite of various people, others say he may have been a figment of their imagination. 'Juba the Sniper? He's a product of the U.S. military,' Captain Brendan Hobbs said in an interview with Stars and Stripes in 2007. 'We've built up this myth ourselves.' As is often the case in the Middle East, wild conspiracy theories went so far as to claim that Juba was an Israeli agent trained by Mossad as a propaganda tool. Most experts agree that the death toll attributed to Juba' is far-fetched, but  his story continues to resonate today. Last year ISIS was reportedly took possession of a giant 10-foot-long sniper rifle. It is so big that it has to be supported on two tripods and fires ammunition three times the size of standard rifle ammunition. An Islamic State terrorist has been photographed aiming it out of a flat window in Kobane, the scene of intense fighting between IS and Kurdish forces. What sort of effect this gun would have remains open to debate, however, according to firearms expert David Dyson. Retaliation: The 'sniper battalion' pictures could be Islamic State's attempt to ramp up their own propaganda campaign following the release of the hit US film, American Sniper (pictured), starring Bradley Cooper . American Sniper: The film was based on the exploits of Chris Kyle (pictured) who was considered one of the deadliest shooter's in US military history . He told MailOnline: 'The problem with identifying the effect of this gun is firstly that we don't know for sure what the calibre is, although there wouldn't be a lot of point in building something like this if it wasn't of a significant calibre. 'Secondly, and probably of more importance, we don't know how well it is made. Is the barrel accurately machined and rifled? 'The effect will also depend on the type of ammunition used. These rounds (23mm) exist  fitted with high explosive incendiary or armour piercing incendiary projectiles.They will be effective against personnel and vehicles including lightly armoured ones.'","Islamic State reveals its own 'sniper battalion' on social media accounts .

"Kim Kardashian has been on enough worst-dressed lists to fill a book, which is perhaps why her mother Kris Jenner, usually two steps behind her famous daughter, has escaped largely unscathed. The showbiz matriarch has repeatedly made crimes against fashion over the past few years. Misdemeanors on her rap sheet include double leather, double leopard (complete with pinstripe suit) and see-through trousers. Scroll down for video . Kris Jenner, pictured left wearing a floor-length faux raccoon fur in January, and, right, in see-through trousers at the Chanel Fashion Show in Paris yesterday . But while the mother-of-six's fashion choices have often been questionable since the early Noughties, Mrs Jenner has really got into her stride after hitting 55. Since 2010, Kris's sartorial misses have regularly outweighed her hits. Ripped white denim, ruffled shirts galore and mid-length leather coats have all featured in her daytime wardrobe. Most recently at Paris Fashion Week, she has been pictured in see-through trousers and Cruella De Vil fur coats. While we applaud her efforts at originality, it is perhaps a wonder why she hasn't taken more notice of Kim, who sent her a blunt email in December last year that was leaked. After seeing a snap of her mother at a party in an outfit she disliked, Kim compiled a scathing critique. 'i love you mom but no more pilgrim adams [sic] family outfits,' wrote the 34-year-old. And driving home her message Kim explained: 'you have exhausted this look . 'done. move on . 'we need chic, tights dresses not this omish [sic] s*** anymore.' It is thought Kim meant to type Amish.

"One James Bond fan was told he looked so much like one of the films' leading men, he decided to make a career out of it. Nick Richmond was first compared to 007 star Sean Connery 30 years ago and has spent the last two decades working as a professional lookalike. But the 65-year-old said his A-list doppelganger was far from complimentary when the pair met - with Mr Connery joking that he was an 'ugly b*****d'. Scroll down for video . Seeing double: Nick Richmond, left, with Sean Connery when he met the actor while on holiday in Florida . Touch of Hollywood: The 65-year-old, centre, said he is still regularly booked to appear as the actor at events . Mr Richmond, from Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, said he is often approached for autographs and photos by mistaken fans. The retired civil servant said his uncanny resemblance has even led to free hotel suites, flight upgrades - and the best tables in some of the world's best restaurants. Mr Richmond said: 'Friends and family always told me I looked a bit like him. 'But when he appeared in The Name of the Rose, one of the first times he was properly filmed with a bald head and grey beard, people said I was the spitting image of him. 'It's funny because his first words to me when I met him were ""you're an ugly b*****d"". 'He's got a bit of a reputation for being grumpy but he was an absolute gentleman - it was great to chat with him and his sense of humour is brilliant. Meeting Tony Blair, who supported an initiative that helped Mr Richmond set up his lookalike business . 'He was filming Just Cause in Florida and I happened to be on holiday at the time so I went to meet him - it was a great experience. 'He'd actually heard of me before and knew that I had been working as his lookalike. 'It's all great fun and it's nice to know that he acknowledges that I'm doing it because I'm a big fan of his.' Mr Richmond, who retired in 2010, set up his own lookalike business in 1995 with the help of a government initiative supported by former Prime Minister Tony Blair. Since then, he has been driving Aston Martin supercars and jumping out of helicopters ever since in a bid to mimic the actor. He said that while the action-packed stunts are now a little more difficult to manage, he still receives plenty of bookings to appear as Connery at events. The Bond fan, who said Goldfinger was his favourite movie from the series, admitted he has enjoyed a number of perks as a lookalike. He ssaid: 'It's definitely got me some good seats in restaurants - I've been very lucky in that sense. 'Restaurant owners in some of the world's biggest cities have sat me right by the window so people think Sean Connery is eating there - that's happened so many times. 'The best one was when I was waiting at Heathrow airport to go to New York about five years ago and a load of Japanese tourists thought I was James Bond. A-list treatment: The Bond fan, pictured, who said Goldfinger was his favourite movie from the series, admitted he has enjoyed a number of perks as a lookalike - such as free hotel and flight upgrades . 'They raced over to me and asked for pictures and autographs - which I did, but I always sign them as myself. 'A lady at the check-in desk asked me if I wanted an upgrade to first-class and I thought to myself, she must know I'm not Sean Connery, she's checked my passport. 'She said she knew, but that the other passengers on the plane didn't, so I was given a free upgrade to first class which was fantastic.' Mr Richmond also revealed that he was given the star treatment while promoting an adventure park in Cancun, Mexico nine years ago. He said: 'I was starring as Allan Quatermain from The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen to promote the Selvatica adventure park in Mexico in 2006. 'I spent 10 days there filming an advert for TV posing as Sean Connery and the man who booked me convinced the hotel owner where we were staying that I was the real deal. 'They put me in the presidential suite for the night and I was driven around in a luxury Rolls Royce while we were there - I was treated like royalty.'","Nick Richmond was first compared to actor Sean Connery 30 years ago .

"It's a scheme that saw Waitrose face a middle-class backlash over complaints that its stores were being invaded by less well-off shoppers. And now the retailer has decided to introduce a stricter policy on its free tea or coffee option for myWaitrose loyalty card holders when drinking at its in-store cafés, as a retail expert claimed it could cost as much as £150,000 a week to provide the perk. It has trialled a scheme at six stores in Bedford, Hitchin, Exeter, Weston-super-Mare, Nailsea and Chester whereby free drinks are only available at the café till to customers buying food as well. This could be anything from a cake to a sandwich or even a full meal - but at these stores you can still get a no-strings-attached free drink from the self-service machine. Changes: From February 9 all members will be asked to buy food if enjoying a free drink in a Waitrose café . And from February 9 cardholders will be asked to buy food if enjoying their drink at all of its cafés. The offer - introduced in 2011 - has allowed anybody with a card to pick up a free Americano, cappuccino, latte, tea, mocha or espresso every day - even if they do not spend anything in store. In some stores, including at Bloomsbury in central London, the free coffee cups are stored at the tills - although customers with a myWaitrose card do not have to make a purchase to receive one. Today The Times newspaper reported that customers do need a shopping receipt at the Bloomsbury store to get their free tea or coffee, but this was denied by Waitrose. The popularity of the myWaitrose card offer has made the retailer the second largest provider of coffee in the UK, with its stores shifting one million cups a week. Popular: The loyalty scheme has five million members, with Waitrose giving out an estimated one million free teas or coffees every week. Shoppers can also get a free newspaper when spending more than £5 . Phil Dorrell, director of the retail consultancy Retail Remedy, told MailOnline: ‘It was a very good commercial marketing ploy that has over the last few years become a little bit abused. ‘It costs them money to do it and they’ve got to ask themselves is it worth it? [Northern supermarket chain] Booths do exactly the same thing. Does it really benefit the actual Waitrose customer? ‘The execution of it at store level has been a little poor and allowed people to come in, get a free coffee and then not really shop - and a lot of these people would tend to do that on a frequent basis. ‘That was not the intent of the card. The intent was a thank you from Waitrose. I think Waitrose when they did it were under pressure from all the other supermarkets doing a price war. ‘They wanted to make a statement to their customers saying “we’re different too”. It’s just a sort of expression of the fact that they were different.’ The loyalty scheme has five million members, with Waitrose giving out an estimated one million free teas or coffees every week. Shoppers with the card can also get a free newspaper when spending more than £5. Mr Dorrell said he estimated that the ingredients of the tea or coffee available at Waitrose would come in at between 12p and 15p, meaning that it could be costing the supermarket as much as £150,000 a week to provide the perk. But he added: ‘Some of that will be extremely beneficial to them as they’re getting new customers, but we don’t how much of that is being abused. That’s the unknown quantity.' A statement on the Waitrose website said: ‘From February 9 we will be asking myWaitrose members who wish to enjoy their free tea or coffee in one of our cafés to also purchase a treat - such as a sandwich, cake, biscuit or piece of fruit. ‘This change will enable us to continue to offer our customers the enjoyable service they expect.’ Choices: The popularity of the myWaitrose card offer has made the retailer the second largest provider of coffee in the UK, with its stores shifting one million cups a week . Christmas rise: This graph published last week on the John Lewis Partnership website shows Waitrose's weekly sales figures up to week 25 (to January 17, 2015), compared to the same weeks in 2013-14 and 2012-13 . And a Waitrose spokesman told MailOnline today: ‘A complimentary tea or coffee while shopping with us is one of our ways of saying thank you to our customers. ‘Most people who have their myWaitrose free drink in the café understand that they should buy something from the café to have with their tea or coffee, and so we are simply confirming that. ‘MyWaitrose members who would like to drink their free tea or coffee in the café will also need to buy something, in the café such as a sandwich, cake or piece of fruit to go with their drink. Customers can still buy a drink in the café too. ‘Of course myWaitrose customers can still get their free hot drink from the self-serve machines whilst they are shopping with us.’ Last September Waitrose reported operating profit  fell 9.4 per cent to £145million because of - among other factors - 'substantial' investment in stores, its website and the myWaitrose scheme. In December 2013 the Mail reported how regular Waitrose customers claimed the supermarket's offer of free cups of tea and coffee in all its stores was attracting the wrong type of clientele. Long-standing customers said at the time that the move was encouraging large numbers of myWaitrose cardholders who have no intention of shopping and merely get in the way. Waitrose boss Mark Price said he believed that shoppers want instant rewards, such as free coffee, rather than the 'meaningless' benefits offered by conventional supermarket loyalty cards. And in March 2014 the Mail told how a woman had to go to the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton after drinking a free coffee from a Waitrose store that contained cleaning fluid. Paramedics were called to the branch of the supermarket in Lewes, East Sussex, and advised her to visit a burns unit, although she is thought to have attended a local A&E instead. Waitrose apologised for the 'unfortunate incident' and sent her a £25 voucher. A spokesman said: ‘We have confirmed that the cleaning fluid does not have any long term impact on health.' The next month MailOnline revealed how a second customer had fallen ill after drinking a free coffee from Waitrose that was contaminated with cleaning fluid. Father-of-two David Sack, 49, was in a rush when he grabbed a free cappuccino at the branch in West Byfleet, Surrey, but felt sick after drinking it. The supermarket chain apologised to Mr Sack, and offered him £25 compensation, but he returned the money because the amount was 'insulting' - and was then presented with £100. A spokesman for Waitrose said at the time: ‘Mr Sack should not have been able to pour a drink while the machine was being rinsed - and we have taken action to prevent it happening again.'","Stricter policy on free tea or coffee policy for myWaitrose cardholders .

"It's easy to while away the hours on the web, but when you've got work to do, the likes of Facebook and YouTube are an unwelcome distraction. To help procrastinators stay focused, a pair of designers has added a modern twist to the traditional typewriter so people can still save their work online, but without the interruptions. Named Hemingwrite, the 'digital typewriter' uses Wi-Fi to save files to the cloud, but doesn't come with email, a web browser or Facebook. Scroll down for video . The Hemingwrite (pictured) is described by its Michigan designers as a ‘minimalist digital typewriter for distraction-free writing’. It has an e-ink display and saves documents to cloud storage, such as Dropbox, but the Wi-Fi enabled processor doesn’t have a web browser, Facebook or email . It was created by Michigan-based Adam Leeb and Patrick Paul and launched on Kickstarter. ‘The Hemingwrite is a minimalist digital typewriter for distraction free writing composition,' explained the pair. ‘It combines the simplicity of a typewriter with modern technology like an electronic paper screen and cloud backups to create the best possible writing experience.’ The inventors said that because the Hemingwrite doesn’t allow access to the web, it helps people work more efficiently. Hemingwrite was created by Michigan-based Adam Leeb and Patrick Paul and launched on Kickstarter. They claim the battery on the word processor will last for more than four weeks. The first batch of pre-orders, initially available from Kickstarter for $349 (£299), sold out and these orders will be shipped in September . The inventors said that because the Hemingwrite doesn’t allow access to the web, it helps people work more efficiently. They have not announced exactly when the typewriter (pictured) will go back on sale, but it is expected to retail for $499 (£328) at some point ‘later this year’ Forget the bells and whistles of today’s smartphones, these high-tech models are being abandoned in favour of the flip and ‘brick’ style devices of the 1980s and 90s. Celebrities including Anna Wintour, Rihanna and Kate Beckinsale have all been spotted on vintage handsets in recent months. So much so, there are now even crossover devices designed to look like retro handsets but with many of the functionalities of modern-day smartphones. And it’s not just smartphones that are being ditched in favour of older gadgets. Last month, reports said celebrities are also switching digital cameras for Polaroids following Apple’s iCloud leak. Sales of Polaroid cameras, which were particularly popular in the 1980s, and produce a developed film image, have risen by around three quarters in less than a year. The device includes a mechanical keyboard, an e-ink display that can be read in daylight, and access to cloud storage such as Dropbox and Google Drive. Its makers also claim the battery on the Wi-Fi enabled, portable word processor will last for more than four weeks. The first batch of pre-orders, initially available from Kickstarter for $349 (£299), sold out, and these orders will be shipped in September. The campaign ran until the 23 January and raised $342,471 (£224,400) of its $250,000 (£164,540) goal. Its makers have not announced exactly when the typewriter will go back on sale, but it is expected to retail for $499 (£328) at some point ‘later this year.’ ‘We’re proud of the prototype units we’ve developed and are excited to move into production in 2015,’ said Mr Leeb. ‘We have lined up a leading manufacturing group to partner with on the 2015 Hemingwrite model and are ready to move swiftly after completing our Kickstarter presale. ‘Our first priority for the software feature set is to deliver a great user experience for writers,’ added Mr Paul. ‘The 2015 Hemingwrite will ship with a minimalist interface but we will also support a development kit (SDK) to fulfill the needs of more specialized professionals like screenwriters.’ Hemingwrite's design is based on the traditional typewriter (pictured in author Ernest Hemingway's house)","Hemingwrite is a ‘minimalist digital typewriter for distraction-free writing’

"It sounds like something James Bond would have fitted to his Aston Martin, but Tesla’s latest car has an 'Insane mode'. It is a form of acceleration that takes the electric P85D from 0 to 60 in a little over three seconds. A car website has now taken passengers on a ride in the dual motor sedan and filmed their reactions when Insane mode hits. Scroll down for video . The video was filmed by  DragTimes. It shows a driver, known  as Brooks, taking people on a ride in the $120,000 (£80,000) car.

For each test, Brooks brings the car to a standstill before pushing the accelerator to the ground. The car accelerates with a jolt, pushing both the driver and passenger back in their seat. The D model, unveiled in October has two motors - one powering the front wheels and one powering the rear wheels. It has a top speed of 155 mph (249 km/h), compared with the current 130 mph (209 km/h) on Tesla’s previous S model. It offers two Sport and Insane acceleration. In Insane Mode, the full 691 horsepower of the electric car's two motors is applied in one go. During recent tests of the Insane acceleration, the car achieved the speed in 3.17 seconds.

"Sarah Palin's teleprompter did freeze in Iowa on Saturday, the former Alaska governor claimed during a Tuesday night interview in which a Fox News Channel host asked her about her rambling and at times incoherent speech that sent her political stock plummeting. The admission came in a freewheeling television segment with Host Sean Hannity in which she declared war on his fellow host Bill O'Reilly for not taking her and real estate tycoon Donald Trump seriously as politicians. Palin also downplayed reports from days earlier that she was planning to run for president in the first place. 'I was asked by a testy reporter while I was promoting my Sportsman Channel show, ""Amazing America with Sarah Palin"",' the self-promoting pol told Fox host Sean Hannity. 'I was asked if I were to be interested at all in running for office, maybe the presidency.' 'And it's certainly not newsworthy,' she added with a shrug and an eye roll, 'for me to have answered, ""Oh yeah, I'm interested, yeah. Next question?"" SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . WHO, ME? Former VP nominee Sarah Palin insisted Tuesday night that she didn't really mean to say she's interested in the presidency – unless Fox host Bill O'Reilly is belittling her (then she's totally IN!) REVISIONIST HISTORY: Sean Hannity (left) asked Palin if her teleprompter malfunctioned on Saturday in Iowa and she said it had, just like during her 2008 acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention – but reporters who witnessed that speech said the prompter worked fine back then . 'The man can only ride you when your back is bent,' Palin said during her rambling speech Saturday in Iowa after the prompter DID freeze, as audience members looked at each other quizzically . Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, made news on Saturday when she flipped through a binder of notes and strung together a series of odd one-liners after her teleprompter went on the fritz at the Iowa Freedom Summit, leaving her audience confused even as some rooted for her. But she defended herself Tuesday night on Fox News. 'Did the teleprompter go down? Did you have trouble with the copy?' Hannity asked her. 'Was there any moment in the speech where you had any difficulty? Because people have been so critical.' Palin insisted that 'I don't read the praise and I don't read the criticism. ... I'm used to teleprompters not working.' 'Remember the GOP acceptance speech back in '08? The teleprompter broke there too. It didn't work, and I kept on going.' That's an exaggeration, according to journalists who were in Minneapolis, Minnesota the night she accepted the role as Arizona Sen. John McCain's running mate that would vault her onto the national stage. 'The teleprompter did not break,' reporter Jonathan Martin, then of Politico, wrote at the time. 'Sarah Palin delivered a powerful speech last night, but she did not ""wing it"".' 'I was sitting in the press section next to the stage, within easy eyeshot of the teleprompter,' he wrote. 'I frequently looked up at the machine, and there was no serious malfunction. A top convention planner confirms this morning that there were no major problems.' US News & World Report blogger Robert Schlesinger wrote much the same thing: that he was 'was sitting in the press section, (behind Palin and off to her right side). I had a clear view of the TelePrompTer, and read along with her.' In Saturday's Iowa speech, however, she was indeed improvising. (This reporter, sitting above her in the front row of the stage-right balcony, saw the prompter freeze – and stay frozen.) 'The man can only ride you when your back is bent,' she said at one point, as audience members looked at each other quizzically. 'So strengthen it! Then the man can't ride you, America won't get taken for a ride, because so much is at stake.' BEWILDERED: Palin's audience often seemed unsure what to make of her as she babbled and danced from subject to subject making little sense . On Tuesday she lashed out at Bill O'Reilly for treating her and Donald Trump like long-shot candidates – insisting that a cable network perceived to lean right should back her all the way . Addressing the controversy over the virtues of the late Navy SEAL Chris Kyle and the 'American Sniper' film that tells his life story, she shouted: “Screw the left in Hollywood!' And at one point she lashed out at Muslim terrorists in a style all her own. 'What we do is strengthen our military,' she said. 'We respect our troops and let them – our troops as our gatekeepers – we let them tell jihadists, ""Uh-uh, this is our house! Get the hell out"".' The 35-minute performance was so uneven that Democratic National Committee Communications Director Mo Elleithee issued a two-word statement afterward: 'Thank you!' Palin spoke at the Iowa event alongside a host of others whose names have been floated as potential GOP candidates, including Ted Cruz, Chris Christie and Mike Huckabee. Her position near the end of the lineup indicated that the event's hosts, Citizens United and Iowa Congressman Steve King, hoped the Alaskan would be a showstopper. She nearly stopped the entire show. Palin, a Fox News contributor, took a shot at top-rated host Bill O'Reilly on Tuesday for dismissing her as a third'tier potential candidate, even as she sought to distance herself from any expectation that she might run. FOX & FRENEMIES: Fox host Bill O'Reilly dismissed Palin and Trump on Tuesday as third-tier politicians who merely 'liven up the proceedings' Trump, a multibillionaire real estate tycoon, says he's serious about throwing his hat in the ring this time around, after several previous campaigns where he folded his tent before the process got properly underway . O'Reilly had handicapped the fast-moving Republican primary season two hours earlier, saying that 'Sarah Palin and Donald Trump certainly liven up the proceedings, but they need effective organizations in 50 states and that will be a major challenge for them.' Palin wasn't amused, and lashed out at him for not siding with her and other conservatives. 'Hillary will be running,' she said, referring to Democratic former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, 'and she will be, you know, the knighted candidate on the left and with the media.' 'Knowing what the media is going to do, It's gonna take more than a village to beat Hillary. There needs to be unity, understanding that we have that – conservatives have that strike against us, you know, right off the bat.' She complained about how O'Reilly had been teasing his show all day on Fox, which she labeled 'kind of a quasi- or assumed-conservative outlet,' 'And that would be, ""Oh, all these GOP contenders thinking about running for president – like Donald Trump, Sarah Palin."" And he names 'em off, he says, ""Oh, what a reality show that would be! Yuk, yuk!""' 'Well the left doesn't do that, okay? They, they, they take this serious, because this is war! And hopefully the media, even the quasi-right side of the media, won't be looking at this as some kind of reality show, a joke.'","Former Alaska governor and tea party darling gave a confusing speech on Saturday in Iowa, rambling after her teleprompter froze .
She said Tuesday that her teleprompter broke during her 2008 vice presidential nomination acceptance speech too, 'and I kept on going' – an account disputer by reporters who were there .

"Emma White has been jailed for a year after she attacked Dean Roche with her stiletto, shattering his cheek so he needed four plates inserted into it . A mother-of-four who broke a man's cheek in four places after she attacked him with her stiletto in a drunken rage has been jailed. Emma White shattered Dean Roche's cheek after she battered him with her high heeled shoe outside a Yates' Bar in Poole High Street in Dorset. White, of Bournemouth in Dorset, was jailed for 12 months for the unprovoked vicious attack. Mr Roche needed four metal plates screwed into his face after the assault, launched on him as he was looking the other way as he waited in a taxi queue. He still has no feeling down the right side of his face eight months after White's assault. White initially denied the five charges she faced - two of affray, two of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and one of inflicting grievous bodily harm. But the 28-year-old changed her plea of inflicting grievous bodily harm just days before the trial was due to start at Bournemouth Crown Court. Mr Roche's right cheek bone was broken in four places by the impact of the heel against his face, leaving him with severe bruising around his eye, and he underwent a three-hour operation to reconstruct his cheek. Mr Roche, 22, who works as a security guard at Asda in Poole, said: 'There was no explanation for the attack other than she was blind drunk and going wild at people. 'I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. 'I'm a bit shocked that she has been sent to jail, I was expecting her to get a suspended sentence, but I do feel like justice has been served.' The incident happened outside a Yates' bar in Poole High Street, Dorset, on April 26 last year. Mr Roche was stood in a taxi queue when White came at him with the shoe she had already taken off and was carrying. He said: 'I had been out for the night and was waiting for a taxi when a woman came out of nowhere and hit me on the side of my head with a stiletto. Mr Roche said he was standing in a taxi queue when White launched the unprovoked vicious attack on him . The security guard needed stitches and had a three-and-a-half hour operation to repair his broken cheekbone . 'It was totally unprovoked. I didn't even see her coming, she came at me from the side. 'I had no idea who the woman was, I had never seen her before. She was on a rampage, hitting other people with her stiletto. 'When she hit me I was in agony - I've never felt pain like it. My mate grabbed hold of me and turned me away because he thought I had been hit in the eye. 'I went home and the next morning I went to hospital. Straight away they told me that my cheek had collapsed. Mr Roche was in hospital after the three-and-a-half hour operation (left) after White's (right) vicious attack . Mr Roche, pictured with his mother Karen Mason, said he still has no feeling down the right side of his face . 'They took an X-ray and found my cheekbone was shattered in four places. I had to have four metal plates put in my cheek during a three-and-a-half hour operation. 'I was signed off work for seven weeks to recover. Eight months on from the attack I still have no feeling down the right side of my face. 'For a while I was very cagey about going on nights out and the first time I went out after the attack I made sure I was in a big group of friends. 'It's been a long eight months and I'm glad it's all done and dusted now.'","Emma White attacked 22-year-old Dean Roche with her stiletto in Poole .

"A mother is urging young people to think before they ink as she wishes she'd never had a giant tattoo drawn on her chest at the age of 18. Full-time mother Lissani, 25, from Leeds, bitterly regrets having the colourful diamond with butterfly wings and a crown emblazoned on her cleavage. She said the tattoo was an act of teenage rebellion following a strict Catholic upbringing but admits  it no longer fits her look or lifestyle. Act of teenage rebellion: Lissani, 25, now regrets the giant tattoo she had when she was 18 as an act of rebellion against her Catholic upbringing . Speaking on the documentary Bodyshockers, which airs on Channel 4 tonight, she said: 'I was a wild child when I was a teenager but I'm far from that now. 'As soon as I turned 18, I wanted to do what I wanted, I smoked and took drugs. 'I wanted to be different and stand out so I had the tattoo. At the time I thought it was really cool and was pleased everyone would be able to see it.' But after getting married and having a son, now three, Lissani said she no longer loves the permanent reminder of her past. The wife and mother thought the tattoo was 'cool' when she first had it done but now she regrets it . The inking is hard to conceal, as illustrated when Lissani met Bodyshockers presenter Katie Piper to be interviewed for the Channel 4 documentary and it can still be seen above her high neck dress . 'When I had my son, that was the nail in the coffin for me,' she explains. 'Watching him lying on my naked chest by my tattoo, I just wished it wasn't there.' The tattoo is difficult for Lissani to conceal unless she wears a roll neck top and she often feels like she is being judged when people see it. She said: 'People must look at me and think I'm a crazy mum or a bad person.' As Lissani's son gets older, she intends to go back to university and then train to be a midwife, but she feels the tattoo could also hold her back in a nursing career. She said: 'Can you imagine when I walk into the room to help deliver a baby and the first thing they see is my huge tattoo? 'They will think I'm crazy. Midwives wear a V-neck uniform and it will show.' Lissani appears on Bodyshockers to urge other young people to carefully consider whether they really want a tattoo and to remember that they will have to live with it forever. After several rounds of painful laser removal surgery, the tattoo is slowly becoming fainter, much to Lissani's relief . The tattoo is less obvious above her top when Lissani meets Katie after the laser removal treatment . She said of her decision: 'When I had it done when I was 18, I really didn't care about my future. 'Now I look at myself in the mirror and I hate it. I liked this design seven years ago but now it doesn't mean anything to me.' Lissani is so desperate to have the mistake erased, she is willing to endure painful laser removal surgery. There is no guarantee the treatment will fully work but after two sessions, she can begin to tell the difference as some of the colours and lines are fainter. Speaking of the treatment she said: 'It's like having an electric shock. 'People think ""If I get a tattoo I don't like, I'll just get it removed"" but it's not that simple. 'I look in the mirror now and get frustrated as it's not completely removed, so now it looks like a very bad tattoo. 'I just have to keep telling myself - focus, it is going to go and then it will look fab.'

"When Danielle Diamond lost her third baby in a row to miscarriage, she was heartbroken. She had low levels of a simple hormone which is prescribed to pregnant women in other countries – but not here. Mrs Diamond was desperate for a sibling for her baby son and vowed she would do everything possible to make it happen. After becoming pregnant for a fourth time, she decided on DIY treatment to give the baby every possible chance. Danielle Diamond, 24, was desperate for a sibling for her baby son, but miscarried each of the three times she became pregnant. After begging her GP to prescribe a progesterone gel, she managed to conceive again and finally gave birth to their daughter, Gabrielle, now 11 months old . Mrs Diamond said all the past miscarriages totally ruined her much wanted pregnancy. Mrs Diamond was delighted when she gave birth to her healthy baby girl, Gabrielle, in November last year . The 24-year-old spent £100 on the hormone progesterone – enough to get her through the all-important first few months of pregnancy. Her GP could not give it to her on the NHS – it is not officially approved for use in this way - but eventually agreed to prescribe it privately. It was a nailbiting time for Danielle and husband Steve, 42, an IT consultant, but the birth of daughter Gabrielle made it all worthwhile. Mrs Diamond, from Colchester, Essex, said: ‘All the past miscarriages totally ruined my much wanted pregnancy. I spent the whole time thinking I was going to lose her. ‘I thought I was going to wake up in labour and she would be dead. It was terrifying. ‘A lot of women blame themselves for miscarriages but I think this is such a simple answer to help these people.’ The proud mother successfully conceived her son Zachary, now three, in 2011 and never dreamed she would have problems completing her family. The couple decided to try for a second child and she became pregnant in October 2012. Mrs Diamond was told by doctors she had low progesterone but assured her the baby was healthy during her first scan. Progesterone is a hormone which occurs naturally in the body. Some women with certain types of fertility problems have low levels of progesterone and are unable to become pregnant or support a pregnancy in its early stages. Progesterone gel is used in the treatment of infertility, sometimes along with other infertility treatment techniques. Sometimes it is used during the first month of pregnancy as well. The hormone is routinely prescribed for women who have suffered miscarriages in Italy and France, with almost one-third using pessaries during the first three months. It thickens the lining of the womb which helps the embryo become implanted in the womb and supports the growing baby. But just hours later she started bleeding and was given the devastating news she had lost the baby. After getting over the initial grief the couple decided to try again and she conceived within a few weeks. Mrs Diamond was again told she was low on progesterone but was assured it would not affect the baby. But just a couple of weeks after finding out the good news she miscarried again. She became pregnant for the third time in February last year but after a few weeks started to bleed. Progesterone is routinely prescribed for women who have suffered miscarriages in Italy and France, with almost one-third using pessaries during the first three months. It thickens the lining of the womb which supports the growing baby. But she was told progesterone is given only to IVF patients here and her baby looked healthy. Her world was shattered when she began to bleed more heavily in the weeks that followed - and was told she had miscarried again. When she became pregnant for a fourth time in April 2013, Mrs Diamond pleaded with her GP to give her the hormone, after carrying out her own research online. She found a big UK-based trial is underway to settle the question of whether women who have miscarried three times or more should be given progesterone in the early weeks of pregnancy. Mrs Diamond and her husband Steve, 42, (second from left) had almost given up hope after suffering three miscarriages in 18 months, but now they are delighted Zachary, now three (left), has sister Gabrielle  (right) As progesterone gel is not available on the NHS, she persuaded her GP to give her a private prescription. She paid £100 to use the gel during the first four months of pregnancy. She is pictured here after giving birth to her daughter in November last year . But she couldn’t afford to wait for the results, and persuaded her GP to give her a private prescription after getting a letter of approval from her miscarriage consultant. She paid £100 to use the vaginal gel during the first four months of pregnancy before weaning herself off it. She was delighted when she gave birth to her healthy baby girl in November last year. The radio DJ and part-time barmaid is glad she took matters into her own hands – but hopes other women will not have to do the same. She said: ‘On forums I found people who had gone to IVF wards and begged people who had leftover prescriptions to sell them to them. ‘It seems like common sense to prescribe people with progesterone if they need it. I don't want anybody to go through what I did if it can be avoided.’ Mrs Diamond awaits the results of a large UK-based trial, which will decide whether women who have had recurrent miscarriages should be prescribed the gel in early pregnancy . Professor Ellis Downes, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at London’s Portland Hospital for Women and Children, believes the hormone is ‘perfectly safe’ and every case should be judged on its own merits. Prof Downes said: ‘On this occasion it is great that the progesterone helped the patient. ‘I am a fan of progesterone and use it for many patients who have had recurrent miscarriage and also undergoing certain aspects of fertility treatment. ‘My personal feeling is that, until there is definitive rigorous evidence that progesterone has been shown in randomised clinical trials to reduce the risk of miscarriage and improve the outcome of pregnancy, then it should not be widely prescribed. ‘Hopefully when we do get results of the trial we will know one way or another whether progesterone has a role in this very important and sad area.’","Danielle Diamond desperately wanted a sibling for her son Zachary .

"A three-storey scaffolding tower toppled over sideways and trapped a passer-by as high winds buffeted a city centre today. The woman, believed to be in her 50s, escaped with just minor injuries after dozens of people came to her rescue while she was pinned to the street in Leicester. The newsagent whose scaffolding collapsed said the trapped woman was saved by his van breaking the metal poles' fall - and the toppling structure also hit a passing bus. Narrow escape: A woman was trapped under this three-storey scaffolding tower when it toppled over today in high winds in Leicester city centre. It was only up to repair damage from a previous fire at the same shop . Police, paramedics and firefighters were all called to the scene and the road was cordoned off. Harj Khera, 41, was behind the counter when a customer told him a board had fallen into the road. 'The next minute it all came down,' he said. 'The woman was underneath the whole thing. 'My van was parked outside the shop and the scaffolding landed mostly on the van. Otherwise it would have been a lot worse. The van saved her really. 'It's right in the city centre so within seconds there were 20 or 30 people clambering over the boards to get her out. She looked OK, just shocked. 'The scaffolding was only up because we had a fire not too long ago and the damage was being repaired. Harj Khera, 41, said: 'Within seconds there were 20 or 30 people clambering over the boards to get her out' 'We're the luckiest shop in Leicester. At least nothing else can happen to us now.' He added the street always suffers from high winds because it has tall buildings which channel the flow of air. Eyewitness Sarah Webb, 29, said: 'There was an almighty crash with scaffolding coming down on a bus and cars. There was metal and wood all across the road. 'There was a woman trapped underneath it all but she was moving and talking. 'A fireman said it looked like the wind had caught the scaffolding and brought it all down. 'It's a very busy road with lots of people walking about. It's lucky more people weren't hurt.' Probe: Building inspectors and the Health and Safety Executive examined the structure, which also hit a bus . Council building inspectors and staff from the Health and Safety Executive were at the scene. A Leicestershire Police spokesman said: 'We were called at 11.30am to a report of some scaffolding that had collapsed in Charles Street in Leicester. 'An officer along with the fire and ambulance services were at the scene, the road was closed for a short time and one woman was injured in the incident.' The Met Office warned there would be gale force winds today and tomorrow as it issued an amber weather warning for snow in northern England and Scotland. The snowfall prompted travel disruption and health fears across large parts of the country, with temperatures expected to plunge as far as minus 10C and reports of hail storms in Cambridge.","Three-storey tower came crashing down into the road today in Leicester .

"The Conservatives will need to slash £21 billion from the welfare budget after the election because the pensions bill keeps rising, experts warned last night. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said Tory spending plans suggest post-election cuts to Britain’s bloated benefits bill will have to be far deeper than those imposed since 2010. In a major new study, the respected think-tank said a £7 billion reduction in working age benefits since 2010 had been cancelled out by a £7 billion rise in the pensions bill. George Osborne will have to cut £21billion off the benefits bill after the next election in order to stick to his spending plans . As a result, the £220 billion welfare bill is ‘virtually unchanged’, it says. But the IFS said the bill would have been £16.7 billion higher without changes introduced by the Coalition. David Cameron has said the Conservatives will impose £12 billion of welfare cuts after the election, including cutting the benefits cap from £26,000 to £23,000. But the IFS said reductions of £21 billion – almost double the amount announced so far – will be needed by 2020 if the Tories are to stick to their plan of cutting other Government spending at the same rate as that seen since 2010. It said the biggest cuts to the benefits system were ‘yet to come’. The report said that cutting another £21 billion from welfare would require a 23 per cent reduction in working-age benefits if the Tories continue to protect pensioners from the austerity drive. The Institute for Fiscal Studies director Paul Johnson has exposed the scale of Government cuts required to balance the books after the next election . And the think-tank warned that if future governments keep Mr Cameron’s ‘triple lock’, under which the basic State pension rises in line with whichever is highest – inflation, earnings or 2.5 per cent – it will result in support for the elderly growing faster than earnings and prices in the long term, at a cost of many billions of pounds a year. The basic State pension will already be costing £1.1 billion more by 2015/16 than if it was linked to inflation and £4.6 billion more than if it was linked to earnings, it found. ‘Growing pensioner numbers and higher entitlements among new pensioners have pushed up real-terms spending on the state pension by £12 billion between 2010/11 and 2015/16,’ the report said. Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves criticised the Government's failure to reduce welfare spending . ‘This has been partially offset by falls in spending on other benefits for pensioners, leaving overall spending on benefits for pensioners £7 billion higher. In contrast, spending on benefits for working-age adults and for children has fallen by around £7 billion.’ Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith last night highlighted figures in the report showing a sharp fall in out-of-work benefits. Spending on Jobseekers’ Allowance is due to fall from £8.5 billion in 2010 to £5.2 billion this year. The £3.3 billion reduction is enough to fund the employment of more than 120,000 nurses. Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘Our welfare reforms – as part of our long-term economic plan – are getting more people off benefits and into work. That means more people waking up every morning with the security of a regular wage and a chance of a better future for themselves and their family. ‘Not only that, it’s cutting the benefits bill too, meaning we can get the deficit down so our economy is stronger and more secure.’ The new report also found there was evidence that tougher sanctions have had ‘some success’ in encouraging claimants to return to work, particularly single parents. But Labour work and pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves said the Government had failed to reduce the welfare bill despite imposing ‘cruel and unfair’ cuts.","The Chancellor will have to cut working-age benefits by 23% after election .

"When Virgil van Dijk was omitted from the Celtic squad that drew at Dundee at the end of August, the official explanation was that he wasn’t in the right frame of mind to play in the game. A more accurate account is probably that having seemingly been denied his wish of a lucrative move to the Premiership the previous day, the Dutchman’s deep displeasure was best kept in isolation for a few days. In fairness to the former Groningen man, his frustration at seeing the road to the south blocked on that occasion hasn’t festered. Even in a Celtic defence that’s been alarmingly porous at times this season, he’s invariably been the stand-out performer. Celtic's Dutch defender Virgil van Dijk was close to a move away from the club in the summer . The turn of the year will bring with it another raft of rumours and doubtless one or two concrete bids for his services. Arsenal are said to be monitoring the player’s situation at close quarters but Sunderland or Southampton look to be more realistic destinations. It’s now a question of where and when rather than if. As in the cases of Fraser Forster and Victor Wanyama, both now domiciled on the south coast, money won’t so much as talk as eventually deafen all parties into submission. There is potentially a strange quirk in all this, however. Unless a prospective suitor comes calling in the early weeks of January – and that rarely happens these days – Celtic might well find themselves fending off bids in the last hours of that month. Even those living in darkened caves are surely by now aware of the fact there’s the small matter of an Old Firm League Cup semi-final clash at Hampden the following lunchtime. So, irrespective of their overwhelming favourites tag for that game, would Celtic dare sell their prized asset the night before such a hotly-anticipated fixture – no matter what kind of money is tabled? Premier League sides Arsenal, West Ham and Southampton are all reportedly interested in the defender . Alternatively, were they to stand firm again, what frame of mind might Van Dijk be in when the team bus pulls up at Hampden? Given the unpalatable possibilities, it seems likely the powers-that-be at Parkhead will move to head this one off at the pass. ‘I’m sure the manager will already have told him he’s going nowhere in January,’ former Celtic striker Frank McAvennie told Sportsmail. ‘I didn’t take to the manager in the beginning but I now think he’s someone who’s got his head screwed on and will see this coming. ‘He’ll be looking at this situation coming up and talking to Virgil about it. Peter Lawwell will be all too aware of it, too. I’m pretty sure they’ll both be saying: “You can go – but now until the end of the season.” But Celtic boss Ronny Deila may be unwilling to sell Van Dijk considering the clash with Rangers . ‘You can’t contemplate having someone with their head scrambled the night before such a big game. He might not be happy to be told he’s definitely going nowhere but at least he’ll have accepted it by the time the game comes around.’ McAvennie firmly believes that, regardless of the prospect of the first game with Rangers in almost three years, there is sound reason for Van Dijk seeing out the season in Glasgow. Hard on the heels of the Hampden clash, Inter Milan come to town. Progression to the last 16 of the Europa League may be the only thing on anyone’s mind, but for the Dutchman the tie also represents a casting couch for the English Premier League. ‘I know there’s been talk of Arsenal but at this stage I think that’s ambitious,’ McAvennie added. ‘But, he can still get a really big club - and if he does well against Inter Milan then who knows. ‘I can tell you for a fact, the English clubs don’t care how well players do against other Scottish teams. Frank McAvennie has said Van Dijk will have to prove himself in Europe if he wants a move to a big club . ‘No disrespect to boys at Ross County and elsewhere but they just aren’t rated in the wider scheme of things. ‘That’s why the European games are massive for him. Unfortunately, although they qualified from their group, Celtic have not done too well as a team in a lot of the European games this season. ‘To get a move like that, you’ve got to do well in Europe. That’s where you are judged. It’s one thing doing well in Scotland but it’s Europe where the English clubs will judge you.’ For a man who made an art form out of dashing for Saturday night shuttles to London, it might seem somewhat rich to talk about others needing a degree of patience to do likewise. Nonetheless, McAvennie believes Van Dijk remaining in Glasgow until at least the summer will be as beneficial for the individual as it will be lucrative for the club. ‘I think it’s in the boy’s interests to stay until the end of the season or possibly even for another year. He’d learn so much not just from the Inter games but from the Rangers match as well. He’ll do well to sample matches like those at any English club. McAvennie believes Van Dijk will be allowed to leave the club but not until the summer transfer window . ‘Everyone is talking up the prospect of him maybe going to one of the big four in England – I don’t think he’s going to get to that level at this stage. Maybe a West Ham or a mid-table team is more realistic. ‘My advice would be to stay because he’s learning all the time. He’s so good he sometimes switches off in the Scottish games so, in a strange way, he doesn’t always look as good a player as he is. ‘He’ll learn not to do that as he’s only young. He’s certainly a very good player but if he’s got ambitions of going straight to a top four or six team in England then another season would do him no harm at all. ‘I think he will go but I don’t think he will go in January. The summer will suit all parties much better.’","Virgil van Dijk was close to a move away from Celtic in the summer .

"Waves as tall as skyscrapers move deep within the ocean, but despite their vast size, marine scientists are unsure what happens when the waves crash into land. Now, 40 researchers aboard ships in the Tasman Sea are trying to unlock the mystery of the 1,000ft (305 metre) waves, by measuring how they travel, how their energy is dissipated and the benefits they may bring. The waves are thought to be important to the oceans' health and understanding exactly how they 'die' could lead to more accurate climate modelling. Scroll down for video . Some 40 researchers   are trying to unlock the mystery of what happens to the energy of 1,000ft (305metre) high waves that travel across seas and crash into land (illustrated), as well as what benefits they may bring . ‘Internal waves’ move just like those breaking on a beach, but are larger and slower, as well as being located deep in seas and oceans. Robert Pinkel, professor of oceanography at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, told TakePart.com: ‘The wavelength between crests is about 100 miles, and they’re moving at jogging speed.’ Internal tides form when the surface tides visible on coastlines wash water back and forth across undersea mountains. They can be created at any depth. The forces created by that movement spawn underwater waves that can travel great distances in the interior of the sea, but no-one is sure what happens to their energy when they hit land. Some 40 researchers aboard ships in the Tasman Sea are studying the waves (the Revelle is shown). They will deploy autonomous ‘deep-diving gliders’ as well as 15 deep sea moorings, which are anchored cables equipped with dozens of temperature sensors and other devices to provide data on the internal tides . Physical Oceanographer, Harper Simmons, likened the east coast of Tasmania - where the reserach is taking place (shown on the map) to a natural laboratory for the study of deep tidal mixing . What: An international ocean study to track the massive internal waves of the Tasman Sea. The project, called the Tasman Tidal Dissipation Experiment (T-tide) will take 10 weeks. Where: The ships – the Revelle and Falkor - have departed from Hobart, Tasmania. Why: Findings about how the waves dissipate will lead to improvements in global climate models and an understanding of how marine nutrients circulate. Action: Scientists will deploy autonomous ‘deep-diving gliders’ as well as 15 deep sea moorings. They will use instruments on the ships to search for turbulent internal waves at depths of up to two miles (3km) that are predicted to collide with the Tasmanian continental slope, and collect data about them. The waves are responsible for stirring up marine nutrients and carrying them to the surface, providing food for everything from plankton to whales. Scientists believe that areas of the ocean with active internal waves, such as the Tasman Sea, are among the healthiest locations. Marine biologists are focusing their research efforts on the sea, which is where the largest internal waves on the planet are formed. Physical Oceanographer, Harper Simmons of the University of Alaska, likened the east coast of Tasmania to a natural laboratory for the study of deep tidal mixing. Tasmania stands in the path of a ‘beam’ of internal tidal waves that are generated on an underwater mountain chain - the Macquarie Ridge - south of New Zealand. Skyscraper-sized waves formed there, take around one week to travel 1,500 miles (2,414km) to the southeast coast of Tasmania, before breaking on the continental shelf – the 'ramp' of rock before the shore. Computer models and satellite observations confirm that four waves slam into the east coast of Tasmania daily. But scientists are not sure how the energy of the enormous waves dissipates. Internal waves are thought to be important to the ocean’s health and understanding how their energy dissipates could lead to more accurate climate modelling as well as building the clearest picture yet of the vast waves. Waves rebounding on a coastline are pictured . The Scripps Institute says in a post: ‘What happens next isn’t so clear, since the wave-breaking and turbulence that results from this impact will happen far below the often stormy sea surface.’ The researchers  say the knowledge they gain on their trip will boost the accuracy of climate modelling. In order to study the waves, they will deploy autonomous ‘deep-diving gliders’ as well as 15 deep sea moorings, which are anchored cables equipped with dozens of temperature sensors and other devices to provide data on the internal tides. Scientists will use instruments on the ships to search for turbulent internal waves at depths of up to two miles (3km) that are predicted to collide with the Tasmanian continental slope - and collect data about them. Scripps oceanographer Matthew Alford said: ‘The goal of scientists is to discover and measure the procession of those internal tidal waves and to document the various phenomena that occur when they impact the deep continental slopes.’ ‘It is conjectured that the turbulent mixing that occurs in the deep sea off Tasmania and other “special” sites is sufficient to affect the overall circulation of the global ocean. Understanding these processes is thus a critical step in predicting our climate.’ Internal waves are responsible for stirring up marine nutrients and carrying them to the surface, providing food for everything from plankton to whales ( a stock image of a humpback feeding is shown) Commenting on the study, Dr Robert Hall, a physical oceanography lecturer at the University of East Anglia (UEA) told MailOnline: ‘The importance of this research lies in understanding how different waters of the ocean are mixed together. ‘The global circulation of the ocean features cooling of surface water in the North Atlantic and around Antarctica. ‘This cold water sinks to the bottom of the ocean and travels towards the equator. Near the surface, warm water moves towards the poles to replace the water that has sunk - the Gulf Stream is one of these warm surface currents. ‘A question that remains is how the cold water near the bottom is returned to the surface to complete the circulation. ‘Mixing of the deep ocean water is required to do this and breaking of internal waves on continental slopes is one way this mixing can occur. The internal waves are generated either by the tide or by storms over the ocean. ‘The global circulation of the ocean is important as it - along with the circulation of the atmosphere - transports heat from the warm tropics to the cool poles. This is one climate connection.","Internal waves - deep in the Tasman Sea - can be 1,000ft (305metres) tall .

"Right-wing Buddhist: The Venerable Ashin Wirathu, who was jailed for nine years in 2003 for inciting anti-Muslim violence, is leader of Burma's so-called '969' campaign to boycott Islamic businesses and bring an end to inter-marriage with Buddhists . The English Defence League might be the last place you would expect a devout Buddhist monk to turn for inspiration. But a right-wing spiritual leader in Burma has revealed how he wants to copy the EDL in his bid to rid his country of its Muslim minority. The Venerable Ashin Wirathu, who was jailed for nine years in 2003 for inciting anti-Muslim violence, says the hardline nationalist party should be applauded for 'not carrying out . violence, but protecting the public'. His comments come a week after more than 1,000 EDL members marched on Downing Street in a protest over the killing of Drummer Lee Rigby in nearby Woolwich, swilling beer, chanting anti-Muslim slogans and clashing with anti-fascist activists. Thirteen people were arrested. Now, orange-robed Wirathu, who leads Burma's so-called '969' campaign to boycott Islamic businesses and bring an end to inter-marriage with Buddhists, says he wants his gang . members to be more like the EDL. According to The Times, Wirathu said: 'People give me various names: The Burmese bin Laden, the bald neo-Nazi. '[But] do you know the English . Defence League? We would like to be like the EDL. Not carrying out . violence, but protecting the public.' The '969' group was behind last month's riots that saw intense clashes between its members and Muslims that left 43 people dead in the city of Meiktila. And only yesterday, hundreds of Buddhist men on . motorcycles waved iron rods in a northeastern town in . Burma before setting fire to a Muslim-owned cinema in the latest incident to spill over from simmering religious . tensions in the country. The intimidating display in Lashio . came a day after a mosque and a Muslim orphanage were torched after . reports that a Muslim man set fire to a Buddhist woman. Residents said a cinema was burned as the mob sped around the town as part of a new wave of violence targeting the religious minority. Odd comparison? Wirathu says he wants his gang members to be more like the EDL, who last week organised a protest in the wake of the killing of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich, southeast London . Beer swilling protest: Last week's EDL protest saw more than 1,000 of its members march on Downing Street . swilling beer and chanting anti Muslim slogans . Protective? Wirathu says he wants to be like the EDL because they 'protect the public' Ashin Wirathu is a firmly . anti-Islamic monk who was jailed in 2003 for inciting anti-Muslim . violence, but was released last year as part of . the broader amnesty for prisoners and admitted being at Meiktila, . although insists he played no part in the violence. 'We Buddhist Burmese are too soft,"" he told the BBC in a recent interview.  'We lack patriotic pride. He urges Buddhists all over the . country to boycott Muslim businesses and hands out stickers printed with . the number '969', which symbolise elements of Buddhism. Wirathu accuses Muslim men of . repeatedly raping Buddhist women, of using their wealth to lure Buddhist . women into marriage, then imprisoning them in the home. But it seems a fear of Muslim success is driving the discrimination. 'They - the Muslims - are good at . business, they control transport, construction. Now they are taking over . our political parties. If this goes on, we will end up like Afghanistan . or Indonesia,' he said. Burma is a mainly Buddhist country, but nine per cent of its 60 million people are Muslim. However, there is an open resentment of Muslims, openly expressed and they are referred to with the derogatory term 'kala.' Motorcade: Hundreds of Buddhists on motorcycles armed with sticks patrol in the streets of in Lashio, Burma . The men became angry after rumors spread that a Muslim man had set fire to a Buddhist woman . People celebrate around the burning mosque. An Islamic school and orphanage were also torched . Last month, horrifying footage emerged of police officers standing by while Burmese Buddhist rioters belonging to the'969 squad' set fire to a Muslim man watched him slowly die. In the grainy footage posted on the internet a man -  almost certainly a Muslim - is seen rolling around on the . ground in agony after being set alight by an angry mob. His body is charred, but he is . clearly still alive and moves slowly as a crowd surrounds him. Several . policeman can be seen looking on. A voice can be heard calling for water, to which another voice replies ' No water for him. Let him die.' The clip surfaced as Human Rights . Watch published a report which concluded Burmese authorities and members of . Arakanese groups have committed crimes against humanity in a campaign . of ethnic cleansing Muslims. The sectarian violence, the worst . seen in Asia's fledgling democracy since last year's conflict, was . sparked after an argument between a Muslim gold shop owner and his . customers in the city of Meikhtila. Agony: A horrifying moment in the clip is when a man, almost certainly a Muslim, is seen rolling around on the ground having been set alight . Slow death: His body is charred, but he is still alive and moves helplessly as a crowd surrounds him and several policeman watch . Slow death: Buddhists with sticks are . The unleashing of ethnic hatred, . suppressed during 49 years of military rule that ended in March 2011, is . challenging the reformist government of one of Asia's most ethnically . diverse countries. Jailed dissidents have been released, a free election held and censorship lifted in Myanmar's historic democratic transition. But the government has faced mounting criticism over its failure to stop the bloodshed between Buddhists and Muslims. Hundreds of Muslims fled their homes to shelter at a sports stadium, said local officials. The . unrest is a bloody reprise of last year's violence in Rakhine State in . western Myanmar, which officially killed 110 people and left 120,000 . people homeless, most of them stateless Rohingya Muslims. Locals . complained there were too few police in this city of about 180,000 . people to subdue the unrest.","Venerable Wirathu is leader of Burma's '969' campaign to boycott Muslims .

"The mother of a teenager with Type 1 diabetes has revealed how she’s sometimes too scared to go to sleep in case she misses checking her daughter’s blood sugar levels in the night – something that could be fatal. Grace Chamberlain, 15, from Fort Worth in Texas, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in 2006. The disease caused her immune system to eat her own pancreas, which left her body unable to produce insulin, a hormone that helps the body use food for energy. There is no cure for the disease and Grace could die in minutes if she’s not given the right quantity of insulin at the right time. Scroll down for video . Patricia Chamberlain (left) has revealed how she’s sometimes too scared to go to sleep, in case she misses checking the blood sugar levels of her daughter, Grace (right), who has Type 1 diabetes - a disease that could kill her in minutes . Grace, 15, from Fort Worth in Texas, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in 2006. The disease caused her immune system to eat her own pancreas . Her mother, Patricia, and father rotate getting up and midnight, 3am and 6am to check Grace’s blood sugar levels and their daily struggle to keep her alive has been turned into a film – called Midnight Three & Six. On the film, first shown by The New York Times, Patricia says: ‘Do I fear sleep? Yeah, if I’m on duty I do.’ Grace is also helped by a diabetic alert dog, Jackie, who can sense when her glucose levels are too low and give her a nudge to get them checked. Since being diagnosed with T1D, Grace has endured 34,000 blood tests. 5,552 shots and 1,660 medical tubing injections, according to her fundraising page. It’s been set up to fund artificial pancreases for Grace and other T1D sufferers. The page emphasizes how the disease can affect anyone, regardless of health and lifestyle. Grace is helped by a diabetic alert dog, Jackie, who can sense when her glucose levels are too low . It says: ‘This disease strikes without warning regardless of diet or lifestyle, and can occur in anyone. There is nothing in the market to prevent T1D, and – at present – nothing that can get rid of it. ‘Too much exercise, wrong measurements of food or insulin can be fatal. Blood glucose must be monitored on average 8 - 12 times a day by pricking the finger for blood. Treatment kits are carried around the clock. Yet even all this cannot fully prevent organ failure, or a host of the disease’s more serious effects, such as blindness, nerve damage, heart attacks, strokes, and pregnancy complications.’ Despite her condition Grace tries to be philosophical and upbeat about life. She says: ‘It’s just scary. One day I could here, and one day I could just not. So I guess I kind of appreciate the little things more.’ Dr Ian Campbell, from Park House Medical Centre in London, is optimistic that we will one day be able to manage Type 1 diabetes far more easily. He told MailOnline: 'Type 1 Diabetes is a terrible disease that seems to strike at random and without warning. It may be viral. We don't know. But for those that suffer it, it means a sudden and complete failure of the pancreas to produce insulin and causes a rise in blood glucose. 'There is, sadly, nothing that we can do to prevent it from happening. Once present, insulin injections are the only treatment. I'm sure one day we'll look back at daily insulin injections and think of them as a throw back to the old days. We need to keep searching for a much simpler, safer, less intrusive way of controlling blood levels of glucose and insulin and helping people with Type 1 diabetes live normal, productive lives much more easily.'","Grace Chamberlain was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in 2006 .

"Polar bears leave messages for each other in the footprints they leave in the snow, according to new research. Biologists have found that the Arctic carnivores produce smelly chemicals from the soles of their feet at different times of the year that create scent trails across the ice. This is thought to help the solitary bears communicate with one another in their huge, icy territories. Polar bears, like above, use their smelly feet to send messages to each other over their vast icy territories . The scientists found that bears tended to be attracted to foot scents taken from bears of the opposite sex, particularly if it is from a fertile female during the breeding season. They believe the bears may leave behind distinctive scents from their smelly feet to help attract mates and avoid clashes between large aggressive males. The researchers also found that the paws of polar bears have abnormally large sweat glands and strange clumps of hair growing from single hair follicles. A team of scientists have recently reported that chemical pollutants accumulating in the Arctic may be reducing the density of the bones in the penises of male polar bears. The researchers from Aarhus University in Denmark found that polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are associated with a less dense penile bone. They have previously shown bears that have high levels of pollutants named organohalogens, which include PCBs, in their bodies, have smaller than average penis bones and testes. Organohalogens contain at least one halogen such as fluorine or chlorine, and are used as solvents and pesticides, as well as in the making of dyes and drugs. PCBs were used to make paints and rubber goods in the 1930s, but were banned in 2001 after scientists discovered they can cause cancer. The researchers warn that the presence of such chemicals, which tend to accumulate over time in the bodies of top predators from the prey they eat, may have disastrous consequences for polar bear mating. They claim that these could be responsible for depositing the scent on the ground wherever the animal stands. Dr Megan Owen, a biologist who led the study at the Institute for Conservation Research at San Diego Zoo in California, said that the polar bears were unusual as most mammals leave their scent by rubbing their bodies or spraying urine onto their surroundings. She said: 'The polar bear relies instead on disseminating scent across a vast and relatively featureless landscape via pedal scents. 'We documented both seasonal variation and intersexual differences in chemosensory behavior and these results provided some support for our hypotheses of the function . that pedal chemosignals play in regulating social and reproductive behavior in the species. 'It is possible that the chemical composition, and potentially information content, of pedal scent changes with the season.' Polar bears may have evolved this unusual form of leaving messages in scent from their feet due to the barren landscape in which they live. While most animals can rub against trees, rocks and other objects, the Arctic ice shelves that polar bears inhabit are almost completely flat. Their ranges can extend to more than 370,000 miles (600,000km). Scientists in the past have observed polar bears sniffing each other tracks and even following them after having a smell. While polar bears are known to have one of the most sensitive noses in the animal kingdom, Dr Owen and her colleagues decided to investigate whether there was more to this behaviour than idle curiosity. In perhaps one of the more dangerous examples of the persuit of knowledge, Dr Owen and her team collected scent samples from the feet of 203 wild polar bears by rubbing cotton buds between their toes. They then tested the reaction to each of these samples by 26 captive polar bears housed in 10 zoos around North America. Researchers found enlarged sweat glands and strange clumps of fur on the paws of female polar bears . Polar bears have been seen to sniff and then sometimes follow the tracks left by other polar bears . They hung the scent samples in boxes near to the captive bears and recorded their interest according to their response - approaching the box, sniffing the box, curling their upper lip and snuffing the scent with their mouths. In general the bears were more interested in the scent from feet of bears of the opposite sex, with males showing almost twice as much interest in the scent of fertile females than non fertile females. Fertile females were also more interested in the scent of males while males would approach the scent of males but show little interest beyond that. Dr Owen said: 'Given the energetic constraints of life on the sea ice, accurate identification of potential mates or adversaries may be essential for reproductive success and survival. 'The scent investigation patterns likely reflect the need to identify potential mates prior to making the energetic commitment to pursue them. Melting ice could make it harder for polar bears to detect and follow the scent trails left by their neighbours . 'The male investigatory preference for female over male odors, coupled with the lack of discrimination of male from female odors by females, is consistent with the notion that male polar bears must identify and locate potential mates, while females only need to signal their reproductive readiness and recruit males to them.' The researchers, whose results are published in the Journal of Zoology, also examined the paws to two dead female polar bears in detail to understand how the scent may be produced. They found the bears had enlarged sweat pores and unusual large clumps of hair growing from single hair follicles that might help deposit the scent. Dr Owen added that changes to the Arctic habitat as sea ice melts and disappears could have a dramatic impact on the ability of polar bears to use these scent trails. She said: 'Effective communication is essential for successful reproduction in solitary, wide-ranging animals. 'Developing an understanding of how communication is tied to the environment may enhance our ability to predict the impacts of rapid environmental change on populations.' Dr Steven Amstrup, chief scientist for Polar Bears International, added: 'This is fascinating new research that suggests scents deposited when polar bears simply walk over the sea ice may play a role in the polar bear’s social and reproductive behavior. 'However, this method of communication, which may be instrumental in helping polar bears find their mates, may be at risk in a warming Arctic, as scent trails increasingly are broken up by melting ice.'","Biologists rubbed cotton wool buds between the toes of wild polar bears .

"After years of travel restrictions towards Cuba, Americans may soon be able to fly to the island on their country's namesake airline. American Airlines president said that his company was looking to add regular commercial flights from Miami. 'We don’t have anything to announce today,' American Airlines president Scott Kirby said to reporters, 'but we will be anxious to start serving Cuba as soon as it’s legally allowed.' The US government has lifted many restrictions on traveling to its southern neighbor this month after a deal to reestablish full diplomatic ties was struck by Barack Obama and Raul Castro at the end of last year. Scroll down for video . American Airlines president Scott Kirby has said flights to Cuba will begin 'as soon as it's legally allowed'. Former Cuban president Fidel Castro released a letter yesterday saying that he does not trust the US but backs the restoration of relations that were severed when he rose to power in the early 1960s. American, JetBlue and Sun Country currently offer charter flights to the Caribbean island, of which American operates 20 from Tampa and Miami. Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, JetBlue and Delta Airlines have all said they are interested in flying to Cuba, though it is unclear when routes will open. United said that it would look to begin flights from Newark and Houston. A bilateral Air Service Agreement must be negotiated before passengers to travel to Cuban airports from the US, according to the Guardian. Such an agreement already exists from Cuba's pre-revolutionary days as a hub of beach resorts. Travelers to Cuba no longer have to obtain an license from the US government under the loosened restrictions, and trips are allowed for 12 reasons including educational tours, and journalism. Pure tourism is not one of the categories. A bilateral Air Service Agreement must be negotiated before passengers can travel to Cuba, which is reestablishing diplomatic relations with the US for the first time since the 1960s . American Airlines had previously said that it was reviewing the changes in US law and how they affect its Cuba policy. Americans are not banned from Cuba and those wishing to go to the communist state before this year could also do so in violation of US law by going through a third country such as Mexico or the Bahamas. About 100,000 Americans visit the island every year along with 400,000 visits from Cubans living in the United States, according to The New York Times. Cuba's tourism industry already caters to numbers of Canadian, European and Latin American visitors, though it remains to be seen how it will be affected by a potential influx of Americans. Former Cuban president Fidel Castro (left) said he still does not trust the United States, though his brother Raul (right) agreed to a landmark deal with Barack Obama to restore relations . Credit card companies American Express and Mastercard have also said that they would begin doing business in Cuba, though no timeline has been given for when transactions could first be processed. The spread of US businesses to the island comes after a long-awaited political breakthrough last year brokered by Pope Francis. In a deal that included the release of 53 anti-Castro political dissidents and the return of American contractor Alan Gross, the US agreed to work towards restoring full diplomatic relations. The US will also ease restrictions on the amount Cuban goods being brought into the US and the amount of money that Cubans can send back to relatives, though Congressional approval is required to fully end the embargo. The decades-long stand-off between the US and Cuba was marked by incidents that threatened to send the Cold War to boiling point. CIA-backed Cuban exiles suffered a bloody defeat in the Bay of Pigs invasion and, during the missile crisis, US warships blockaded the island. The embargo hurt the Caribbean island's economy but it failed to unseat the communist government led by the Castro brothers. The Peterson Institute for International Economics predicts that trade between the US and Cuba could top $10billion annually . Experts said easing the embargo would breathe life into Cuba's moribund economy, which has seen bilateral US trade shrivel from $962million in 2008 to $401million last year. A 2014 report by the Peterson Institute for International Economics predicted that two-way merchandise trade could surpass $10billion annually once the embargo is lifted. With their window for action closing, both sides were under pressure to make a gesture. Obama has only two years left in office. Fidel Castro, who has had a colossal presence in Cuba for half a century, was conspicuously absent from the detente sealed by his brother. Among the world leaders welcoming the developments was French President Francois Hollande, who said a rapprochement was needed to put an end to the Cold War 'once and for all'. Speaking outside a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called the steps 'encouraging.' Meanwhile, the EU is seeking to normalise its own ties with Havana.","Airline's president says flights begin 'as soon as it's legally allowed'

"A man desperate to have a perfect smile like singer Lana Del Rey spent a fortune on fillers that would give him the singer's luscious lips, but he was left with a trout pout instead. Dean, 24, from Newcastle, now says he wishes he'd never undergone the beauty treatment three years ago. Speaking on the documentary Bodyshockers, which airs on Channel 4 tonight, he said: 'I regretted it pretty much instantly. I looked in the mirror and thought ""what have I done?""' Dean, 24, from Newcastle, spent a fortune on lip fillers to get a plump smile like the singer Lana Del Rey, but claims he was left with a trout pout instead (Dean pictured before, left, and after, right) Dean's lips inflated to twice their normal size and it took six months for the swelling to subside. He was then left with sore and achy lumps under his top lip. He said: 'Inside when you touch it, you can feel all these hard lumps. When I turn my lip up you can see tube-like lumps. After having the fillers, Dean's lips inflated to twice their normal size . 'They are really sensitive and sting when I eat certain foods or use lip balm.' Dean's boyfriend, Darren also joked that his lips looked like sausages and claims they make kissing unpleasant. He said: 'When I kiss you I can feel them. I would prefer him to have a natural look.' Dean agreed that he wanted to go back to how he was before the beauty treatment. He said: 'I want to reverse it, I want to get back to natural-looking lips, I don't want Darren to feel lumps like frozen peas when he's kissing me.' The cameras followed Dean as he has a reversal treatment where a chemical is injected into his lips. The chemicals are designed to break down the filler that is in lip, so they can then be sucked out. Dean paid for lip fillers so that he could look like the celebrity Lana Del Rey . Surgeon Dr Esho of Le Beau Ideal, who performed the procedure for Dean on Bodyshockers last night, said: . 'Dean had very lumpy, over filled lips. This is characteristic and common from overuse of filler. 'Luckily his fillers were semi-permanent, so using a product called hylase I was able to give precise injections into the lip, dissolve the filler and restore his lips.' Afterwards, Dean said he was delighted with the result. He said: 'The sensation of having small marbles under my lip is gone now, it feels back to normal.'

"After meeting Marine Ben McBean for the first time in 2008, Prince Harry declared that the former Royal Marine was 'a hero'. Today, he turned out to roar on Marine McBean, 27, as he completed a gruelling 31-mile run on behalf of the Poppy Appeal - and told the runner to go and have a 'well-deserved beer'. The appearance of the royal came as a complete surprise to Marine McBean, who had designed the route through London using a smartphone app to look like a Royal British Legion poppy. Scroll down for video . Surprise! Marine Ben McBean found a surprise royal visitor waiting for him as he completed a 31-mile run . Planned out: Starting close to the Tower of London, Marine McBean's run followed the outline of a poppy . 'I’m still in shock. I didn’t expect to see Harry,' said Marine McBean, following the run. 'He said ""well done"" and that I’d raised lots of awareness for a good cause. 'He told me to go have a bath and a well-deserved beer. It was just like picking up where we left off.' The two men first met in 2008 when a badly injured Marine McBean was repatriated to the UK on the same plane that was taking Prince Harry home. Clearly touched by his plight, the royal dubbed him a 'hero' after learning that he had lost his left arm and right leg as a result of an IED blast. Doctors had feared that Marine McBean, from Plymouth, might die from his injuries but the former commando recovered and is now back on his feet with the help of a prosthetic leg. Thrilled: Harry told the former soldier to go and have a 'well-deserved beer' following his charity run . Hero: The former Royal Marine was declared a hero by Prince Harry after their first meeting in 2008 . Achievement: Marine McBean during his run and in front of Nelson's Column (left) and with Simon Weston . Despite the enormous amount of progress he has made, the former soldier did admit that it hasn't always been easy and revealed that running on his prosthesis is painful. 'I found it very difficult to get from A to B,' he added. 'The run was both physically and emotionally exhausting, but so rewarding.' Joining Prince Harry at the finish line close to the Tower of London was another former soldier, Falklands veteran Simon Weston. who was badly burned when Argentinean bombers attacked a group of British troop transport ships in June 1982. Along with Marine McBean, Mr Weston is a long standing supporter of the Poppy Appeal, which is currently enjoying a boost courtesy of the Vodafone Foundation, which provided the technology required to create Private McBean's poppy-shaped route. He had used a running app to create the giant poppy outline on a London map, which other runners can follow by visiting the website firsts.com. The Vodafone Foundation will match every pound donated to Marine McBean’s cause, up to £100,000, and the funds raised will help the Royal British Legion’s work to support ex-servicemen and women. Big hug: Marine McBean also got a huge hug from his running partner Paul Brown as they completed the run . Hard work: Marine McBean, seen here with Mr Brown, described the run as tough but rewarding . Innovative: Marine McBean used a Vodafone app to create his 31-mile poppy shaped route . 'We’re hugely grateful to Ben McBean and Vodafone for their commitment to the Big Poppy Run and hope that Ben’s run will inspire many others to take part in this exciting challenge,' added Charles Byrne, the Royal British Legion's director of fundraising. 'The money raised will provide vital support to serving and ex-service people, and their families, whether living with bereavement or disability, finding employment, or coping with financial stress - the same problems facing First World War veterans when they returned to the UK 100 years ago.'","Marine Ben McBean, 27, was declared a hero by Prince Harry in 2008 .

"In the Americas' most populated city, the word 'casa' can mean anything from the president's £4.4million mansion - to the carriage of an rusted freight train. In an impoverished district of Mexico City, over two hundred people have lived in an abandoned train for over 20 years, with each of the 40 rusted wagons containing on average 20 people each. A community made up of railway workers and their families, the neighbourhood on wheels now boasts a primary school, wireless internet connection and shops selling tacos from cut-out windows.

'It's been a huge change,' said Oscar Hernandez, who recently moved into Wagon 28, home to his girlfriend, his girlfriend's children, his mother-in-law, his girlfriend's siblings, their partners and children in Wagon 28. The 30 square-metre wagon is home to a total of 16 people. 'Before I was living alone in a rented apartment,' he told MailOnline. 'When I moved in with my girlfriend and her family it was overwhelming.' 'Space is certainly a problem, and things have only gotten more cramped as the family has grown,' said 31-year-old Marta Mendoza, Oscar's girlfriend who has lived in the train wagon for most of her life. 'There's nowhere to hide when there is a fight.' The lived-in train is a rare sight. Each carriage is the size of a shipping container, with a welded-out front door facing onto adjacent tracks where working trains run. Advertisements for wagons selling chicken and fruit are painted beneath the high windows, while others have constructed entire concrete annexes alongside their metal box homes. Washing lines wave faster in wake of passing engine cars. The area below the cars, where the rusted tracks and wheels have sat motionless for two decades, is used by some residents as attic space. Others leave their children to play hide-and-seek around the machinery. Attics: The spaces underneath the wagons have been turned into attics by some families, while others are used by children as play areas - and this one is used by Daniel Leon, collecting the grain he exchanges for cheap liquor . Community: Entire families live in the wagons, known as 'The Beast' -  a nod to the trains on which Central American migrants cross Mexico on their way north to the US border . Railway: The wagons were abandoned because they fell between two companies when the railways were privatised - and neither claimed them . Peaceful: There used to be a lot of burglary in the area, but things have now changed for the best . 'I used to love playing under the cars as a child,' says Nicolas Mendez, who lives in Wagon 4. 'You can run the length of the train under the tracks and enter other people's carriages without using the front door.' 'There used to be a lot of burglary,' said Daniel Leon, who lives in Wagon 31. 'There was no security around the abandoned train station and gangs used to terrorise the residents. 'Things have calmed down since the community established a neighbourhood watch, people feel safer around the tracks today than they did a few years ago.' Crowded: There are about 40 families living in the wagons in Mexico City . Demand: Roberto Hernandez, the Naucalpan station master who lives in Wagon 40, was given permission to allow railway workers live in the wagons by the companies - and filled each one as they were needed . Spacious: Each carriage is the size of a shipping container, with a welded-out front door facing onto adjacent tracks where working trains run . Scrap: Despite the community living in the wagons, the Mexican government has decided it now wants them for scrap - so is trying to evict the families . The community's primary school, which teaches children up to age 12, has had to expand as a result of the growing community. Alan Contreras teaches a class of 25 children in the converted classroom of Wagon 1. 'It's like any other school, except that I live in the wagon next door,' he told the MailOnline, as the unruly Mexican children ran amok during a maths lesson. 'You have to watch the children very carefully at break times. We've had kids get stuck in the machinery of the undercarriage before.' The primary school not only takes students from the 40 or so families who live in the train carriages, but also from the wider municipality of Naucalpan, the poor district of Mexico City in which the train is situated. School: Children up to the age of 12 are taught in Wagon 1, which has been converted into a classroom . Learning: There are 25 children enrolled in the school, with some coming from the wider community . Normal: Teacher Alan Contreras says his class is just like any other - the only difference is it is in a wagon . Eagle-eyed: 'You have to watch the children very carefully at break times - ee've had kids get stuck in the machinery of the undercarriage before,' says Contreras . When Mexico National Railways was privatised in 1995, the investors who took over the company broke it up into four separate, privately-run organisations, each of which marked out a territory in which they were to operate. 'The Beast', as its residents affectionately call the train (in honour of the trains on which Central American migrants cross Mexico on their way north to the US border) sits between the territories of two separate railway companies, and was claimed by neither when the buyouts occurred. 'When the railways were privatised the train was abandoned,' explained Roberto Hernandez, the Naucalpan station master who lives in Wagon 40. It was Roberto who first organised for railroad employees to inhabit the abandoned carriages. 'The company (Mexico National Railways) gave permission for employees to live in the carriages. I simply filled demand as it came.' 'It's a peaceful community,' said Daniel Leon, who lost his legs 20 years ago, after falling asleep on the train tracks following a 56-hour shift. When he woke up, he says, his legs were gone. Business: Daniel Leon, who lost his legs 20 years ago, works underneath the railway carriages . Fight: The families who have made the wagons their home have vowed to fight agains the evicitions . Today Daniel earns money by crawling under the stationary freight train which waits outside the flour factory next to his train carriage. 'I couldn't do it if I had any legs,' he says. Placing a tarpaulin under the carriages' outlet taps, he catches any loose grains of wheat as he bangs on the structure. 'I make tortillas to eat from the grains, the rest I exchange for cheap liquor,' he revealed. Last August, the residents of the train received a letter from the Mexican federal government demanding that they leave the train carriages, since, as the remaining government assets in the railways are liquidised, the wagons are wanted to be sold for scrap metal. The residents are fighting the action. 'This train wagon is our home,' said Marta Mendoza, 'My children were born here, it's seen too many memories to give it all up now.'","The abandoned wagons have been homes for the families of railway workers for the last 20 years .
About 40 families now live in the rusted freight train carriages in Mexico City, next to a working railway line .
There is access to wifi and a shop, while 'Wagon 1' turned into a classroom teaching 25 children, up to the age of 12 .

"This is the moment a self-proclaimed  drinks 'connoisseur' gets fooled by a fake and very unhealthy juice brand 'Juce', master-minded by TV host Jimmy Kimmel. Alex from New Zealand willingly does a taste test on screen at a farmer's market in Los Angeles. He samples 'Cure', a supposed new high-end citrus refreshment retailing for $19 per bottle. Little does he know it's actually a mix of water and 20oz of Tang powered orange consisting of more than 2,000 calories and 520gms of sugar - more than 20 times the recommended daily limit.

He adds that the concoction is 'very light' and perfect for the summer. But he's not the only one apparently caught out by Kimmel's fake juice prank. Another man says Cure  is much 'fresher' and 'more delicious' than a beverage made form concentrate while a woman states that it's definitely worth the $19 price tag. Kimmel's producers then whipped up three other equally unhealthy 'Juce' recipes dressed up as 'miracle cures'.

"Surplus airfields, barracks and military vehicles must be sold off to ensure maximum resources are put into front-line forces, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon will warn. He will hail efficiencies made by the coalition over the past five years and boast that they have been achieved while still maintaining the Nato target for military spending to be 2 per cent of gross domestic product. But he will insist the 'job is far from over' and the Government has to keep 'sweating our buildings and land'. Defence secretary Michael Fallon, pictured, will announce plans to sell surplus MoD land and equipment . The comments, in a speech to the Institute for Government (IfG), come amid complaints about the scale of cuts to the Armed Forces, with the size of the Army being cut by a fifth to 82,000 and plans to make up the shortfall with reserves. Prime Minister David Cameron has also refused to commit to maintaining Britain's defence spending at 2 per cent of GDP after the election. Mr Fallon is expected to say: 'The job's far from over. With continuing demands on our resources, with the cost of manpower and equipment rising, and with competition from emerging nations increasing efficiency in defence cannot be a one-off. 'As in any big organisation MoD must not merely be match-fit, it must be permanently fit. Every year we should be looking to take out unnecessary cost, to improve productivity, and to sweat our buildings and land so we can better support the front line. 'Over the past four and a half years we have shaken up the system, made big savings, and delivered capabilities. All this while meeting Nato's 2 per cent and 20 per cent targets. Today defence is fighting fit with a balanced budget able to invest in the kit and people we need to keep Britain safe.' The state received £53 million after it sold Brompton Road Tube station which was owned by the MoD . The Old War Office, pictured, was one of the properties sold for a combined total of £380 million . Contrasting the Government's current approach with that of the Labour administration, he will say: 'In 2010 we inherited a chaotic legacy with a £38 billion budget black hole, taxpayers shouldering the cost of overruns and a culture beset by the inability to take tough and timely decisions. 'The results of our reforms are clear - now there is a balanced budget, cost savings and equipment programmes that are overwhelmingly on time.' Britain needs to go further in 'rationalising our defence estate', Mr Fallon will say. 'We have got rid of old property we don't need,' he insists. 'Whether it's an old barracks, a country house, some polo fields, the Old War Office or Brompton Road Tube station sold for £53m. That approach has generated sales of nearly £380 million. 'We've taken the same tack with equipment selling 123 surplus armoured vehicles to the Latvian army and bringing in almost £40 million and strengthening friendship with a critical Nato ally. 'Now we need to ask more questions about our assets - do we need 57 separate sites within the M25, how many airfields do we need, how many cars and vehicles do we need, and how do we go further in rationalising our defence estate?'","Government will sell surplus MoD land to pay for front-line equipment .

"The pregnant wife of Olympic ski champion Bode Miller has shared a new photo of her growing baby bump. Morgan Beck, who is now six months along with her first child posted a side-on selfie on Instagram with the words: '6 months, 28 lbs and an amazing appetite. This isn't so bad.' The professional volleyball player and model, 27, added in the comments that she was 'impressed' by her weight gain. Scroll down for video . Three months to go! Bode Miller's wife Morgan Beck has shared a selfie of her growing baby bump . She also shared that she and her husband have decided not to find out the sex of the baby before it is born. 'It's going to be a surprise!' she wrote. 'It's so hard for me not knowing though.' The couple, who married in 2012, confirmed in December that they were expecting a baby. It will be a first child for Beck and a third for Miller, 37, who has a six-year-old daughter with Chanel Johnson, and a son, two, with ex-partner Sarah McKenna. The announcement came just weeks after Beck suggested that McKenna became pregnant with Miller's son by 'taking a condom out of the trash'. Mom to be: Beck shared another baby bump snap in December, just days after she and her husband announced they were expecting . Showing: In a photo of the couple posted over Thanksgiving (above), Beck's little bump can be seen . In an anonymous November post on TheBump.com, she wrote: 'Girls do crazy things for money... including taking condoms out of trash cans and locking themselves in a bathroom.' But when readers became aware of her identity, the image and posts were promptly removed. McKenna and Miller were involved in litigation over custody of their young son since his birth, with the case only being settled at the end of last year, though details have not been made public. Even more strange is the fact that the boy's legal name is Samuel Bode Miller-McKenna, though Miller calls him Nathaniel to honor his brother who died of a seizure at the age of 29 in 2013. Drama: In November, Beck accused Miller's ex Sara McKenna (left) of getting pregnant with their son (pictured with Miller, right) by taking a condom out of the trash . Champion: Miller is the most successful male American alpine ski racer of all time . McKenna dismissed Beck's claims about how she got pregnant, saying: 'Sam was conceived the old fashioned while we were on vacation in Florida. 'This Morgan thing has been getting a little out of control and downright scary and I would like it to stop.' Miller and Beck met in 2012 just months after he began dating McKenna, and were married in October 2012. Early in 2013, Beck suffered a miscarriage, just one month before McKenna gave birth.","Olympic ski champion Bode Miller, 37, and his wife Morgan Beck, 27, announced in December that they were expecting their first child together .

"Scientists have captured the first ever video footage of one of the least known and most elusive wild cats on earth. The African golden cat was recorded by a camera trap hunting during daylight in Kibale National Park, Uganda. This new footage shows an African golden cat hunting red colobus monkeys gathered around and feeding on the dead wood of a tree stump. This new footage shows an African golden cat hunting red colobus monkey. It attacks a group of red colobus monkey gathered around a tree stump,causing them to scatter (left image) leaping in from the left (middle) before fighting with one. Eventually, it retreats, leaping back over the log to make its escape (right). The African golden cat is found only in the forests of Central and West Africa, and grows to the size of a bobcat, weighing between 5-16 kilograms. Very few western scientists have observed the living animal in the wild and almost all records of the African golden cat consist of photographs taken by remote camera traps, or of dead animals (usually killed by local hunters). The forest-dwelling species is threatened across its range by intensive bushmeat hunting (the hunting of wild animals for meat) and loss of habitat due to deforestation. It was recorded with a camera trap set by Samuel Angedakin, Kibale Project Manager for the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology's Pan African Programme: The Cultured Chimpanzee, in collaboration with the Ngogo Chimpanzee Project, Uganda Wildlife Authority and the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology. 'It is an exciting and rare glimpse into the world of this fascinating cat,' said Kaplan scholar and graduate student, David Mills. 'We know a lot more about golden cats than we did a few years ago and yet we still know almost nothing about their behaviour. 'Primatologists in Kibale have observed monkeys emitting alarm calls at golden cats on several occasions and, considering this latest evidence, it's not hard to see why.' Kaplan Scholar and graduate student, Laila Bahaa-el-din, said , 'An adult red colobus monkey is a considerable opponent for an African golden cat. 'With the golden cat failing to make a fatal bite immediately on ambush, it had to make a hasty retreat.' 'Watching a golden cat in full ambush of large monkeys in this video provides hunting details we could previously only piece together from brief sightings. 'It also portrays nicely why monkeys might mob a golden cat, as can be seen in the unique footage of a golden cat trying in vain to catch a cat nap while precariously perched in the fork of a tree.' Further footage, this time of a golden cat sleeping in a tree, has been recorded by Yasuko Tashiro of the Primate Research Institute at Kyoto University. The video was recorded in the Kalinzu Forest Reserve, Uganda, and shows monkeys surrounding the golden cat and harassing it until it descends from the tree.

"Love does exist – and knowing if you have it may be more straightforward than you think. It involves asking two simple questions that economists say can accurately predict whether or not you're likely to divorce in the future. These are: 'How happy are you in your marriage relative to how happy you would be if you weren't in the marriage?' and 'How do you think your spouse answered that question?' People who thought they would be no worse off being single than they were being married were more likely to end up that way. But people who overestimated how happy their partners were in their relationship were even more likely to find themselves on their own six years later. Back in the 1980s, scientists asked these two questions to 4,242 couples, and then asked them the same again roughly six years later. Economists Leora Friedberg and Steven Stern, at the University of Virginia, recently analysed the data and found, unsurprisingly, people who thought they would be no worse off being single than they were being married were more likely to end up that way. But people who overestimated how happy their partners were in their relationship were even more likely to find themselves on their own six years later. Only 40.9 per centof couples accurately identified how their spouse would answer the question. This meant that almost 60 per cent of couples had imperfect information about each other, and roughly a quarter of those had 'serious' discrepancies in overall happiness. Overall, about seven per cent of couples in the sample were divorced by the time the second survey was conducted. Pictured is California billionaire Elon Musk and actress wife Talulah Riley who were together for a year after they remarried, but have now split . For singletons fed up with their family and friends asking whether they have met ‘that special someone,’ there are two new apps that could help them fake a relationship. The Invisible Girlfriend and Invisible Boyfriend apps will send convincing text messages and even voicemails from a virtual partner as 'proof' of a relationship. It was created so that single people under pressure to find a partner, but who don’t want to date, can practice flirting, or simply use the service to keep well-meaning relatives off their back. The St Louis-based company says on its website: ‘Invisible Boyfriend gives you real-world and social proof that you’re in a relationship - even if you’re not - so you can get back to living life on your own terms.’ Currently available as a private beta version in the US and Canada, users will be able to download a gender-specific app and start receiving messages from a fictional partner, for around $25 a month. Women tended to think that their husbands would be worse off than their husbands thought they would be if they found themselves single again. Men had the opposite reaction. Overall, about seven per cent of couples in the sample were divorced by the time the second survey was conducted. Among those who correctly assessed how unhappy their partner might be in the case of separation, the divorce rate was less than 6 per cent. Of those men who overestimated how unhappy a divorce would make their wives, 13 per cent ended up on single. Among women who overestimated how unhappy their husbands might be, 14.5 per cent end up divorced. The researchers say overestimating happiness affects how couples settle conflicts  through bargaining. According to bargaining theory, the more one spouse misjudges his or her partner's happiness, the more likely he or she will bargain 'too hard' and make a mistake. As an example Professor Stern explained, 'If I believe my wife is really happy in the marriage, I might push her to do more chores or contribute a larger portion of the family income. 'If, unbeknownst to me, she's actually just lukewarm about the marriage, or she's got a really good-looking guy who is interested in her, she may decide those demands are the last straw, and decide a divorce would be a better option for her.' The findings reveal just how important it is to know how willing your partner is to leave a relationship, the scientists say. 'The idea of love here is that you get some happiness from your spouse simply being happy' In this scenario, pushing a bargain too hard, based on misperception of a partner's happiness, will result in a divorce that wouldn't otherwise have occurred. 'This data shows that people aren't being as tough negotiators as they could be, and then we realised that we needed to include caring in the model for it to make sense,' said professor Friedberg . 'The idea of love here is that you get some happiness from your spouse simply being happy' 'For instance, I might agree to do more house chores, which reduces my personal happiness somewhat, but I get some offsetting happiness simply knowing that my partner benefits.' The findings, the say, reveal just how important it is to know how willing your partner is to leave before you pick your battles.","US researchers asked 4,242 couples, 'how happy are you in your marriage relative to how happy you would be if you weren't in the marriage?'
They then asked, 'how do you think your spouse answered that question?'

"A heroic father and son took down two men on Saturday night after they threatened a mother and her children with a weapon following a minor car collision. Gary Richie, 54, and his 35-year-old son Jacob were walking past Monster Jam in Orlando, Florida with their family when they saw the ruckus around 10pm and immediately intervened. Shelley Mae Moore, 34, had been driving her brother and her children in her minivan in bumper-to-bumper traffic when two men allegedly side-swiped her with their Ford pickup. When she pulled up to confront them, things turned very nasty very quickly, Richie Sr. said. Scroll down for video .

They gave statements to police about what had happened and were released . He watched as the driver, Stephen Page, 21, apparently pulled out a gun and pointed it at the woman as he drove past. His passenger, Cory Gathings, 21, then jumped out of the truck with a shotgun, he said. 'It deteriorated really quick when the guns came out,' he told WKMG. 'When the passenger got out, he had a shotgun. He pointed it at the van and started walking towards the van. And when he did that, that's when I rushed him and pinned him against the truck.' He called for his son to help take away the gun. When police arrived on the scene, Richie held the shotgun over his head to show he was surrendering, but police drew their weapons, the Orlando Sentinel reported. Richie and his son complied with the officers' demands but Page walked over to Richie and tried to grab the shotgun back from him. Richie's son knocked Page to the ground, he said. Arrested: Stephen Page, 21, left, was driving the pickup that allegedly hit the mother's van and pulled out a weapon as he drove past.

'If [Page] had've gotten that shotgun and stood up with all those police officers with guns drawn, he might've been the lone target,' Richie told the Sentinel. The father and son were released after police took their statements. They did not suffer any serious injuries. Richie, a former member U.S. airman and a former police officer, said when he saw children in the back of the mother's van he knew he had to act. 'If I didn't do something, something bad could have happened,' he said. 'There are lots of kids and families that are jeopardized by that kind of behavior and it's just unnecessary.'

"The last time I encountered escargots they were served up by a French waiter, sizzling in garlic and herb butter. Now, one is slithering up the bridge of my nose while five others are being stuck onto other parts of my face by a Thai beautician, all secreting snail slime to hopefully smooth out some wrinkles and otherwise give me a younger-than-my-age look. That this latest addition to the global beauty and wellness craze — snail facials — should surface in the hills of northern Thailand is only natural. This Southeast Asian country ranks among the world's top spa destinations, with massage treatments of every description offered around just about every corner. Other members of the animal kingdom are also enlisted, including fish at some 4,000 pedicure spas. Merely another marketing ploy or an effective way to plump up skin in need of repair or rejuvenation? Expert opinions differ. The two young Thai women reclining next to me at Chiang Mai's Snail Spa sang the praises of helix aspera muller glycoconjugates, snail mucus for short. Scroll down for video . Escargot-no! A customer at the Snail Spa in Chiang Mai, Thailand, endures its signature facial in which the gastropods slither over one's face . A beauty high? The snails took a particular liking to the reviewer's nose since they are fond of climbing . And when I returned home, my wife described my face as 'different,' but declined to go into detail. Appropriately, given the French passion for these gastropods, the spa was started last year by two Frenchmen who had imported 100 of them from home. The colony now boasts more than 30,000, munching on chemically free carrots, cabbage and aloe on a certified organic farm. 'We take care of the snails as if they were our family, our babies. You can see they look very good,' says Luc Champeyroux, one of the partners, gently applying one to his forearm. He does confess to eating escargots ('but not mine'), plans to breed some for the table and is currently experimenting to produce 'the perfect snail caviar.' A chosen few get plucked from the farm for duty at the spa, where I opted for the 45-minute Snail Spa Celebrity Course. For $30, it's a bargain compared to the $200 customers must shell out at Tokyo's Ci:z.Labo, a beauty salon where snail massage made its debut in 2013. Spas have also opened in China and London, and the French duo are expanding to Bangkok next month. Given its novelty, Chiang Mai public health inspectors last month descended on the spa to determine whether the treatment was safe and if imported snails — officially classified as 'alien creatures' — might prove harmful to local species. Results of the investigation have not yet been released. Budget beauty: A 45-minute facial at the Snail Spa costs $30 - a bargain compared to the $200 customers must shell out at Tokyo's Ci:z.Labo, a beauty salon where snail massage made its debut in 2013 . Tried and tested: While the facials are new, the use of snail mucus is said to date back to ancient Greece, when Hippocrates reportedly crushed snails and sour milk as a cure for skin inflammations . While the facials are new, concoctions made from snail mucus are said to date back to ancient Greece, when the great physician Hippocrates reportedly crushed snails and sour milk as a cure for skin inflammations. In recent times, the French have turned this essence of escargot into assorted creams and lotions. The fluid, exuded by snails when under stress, is known to contain beneficial nutrients and antioxidants, but Bangkok-based Dr. Dissapong Panithaporn and other dermatologists say that there has been no significant scientific research on how these actually work when applied to the skin. Champeyroux, a manager in France's nuclear power sector before falling in love with Chiang Mai some years ago, says his all-natural line of snail products, Coquille, acts against burns, acne, stretch marks, scars and aging. The two women next to me concurred. Taksaphan na Pohn, a 22-year-old recent university graduate, said she had earlier tried laser and other techno-treatments but after some research decided that 'natural therapy' was better. She said snails helped clear her acne when she was stressed during her studies. Lettuce help you... Helix aspera muller glycoconjugates, or snail mucus, is believed to contain antioxidants . Slimy business: Luc Champeyroux, co-owner of the Snail Spa, pictured on his gastropod farm in Chiang Mai . 'My face is firmer and softer,' she said. 'But you don't get immediate results. It shows gradually.' Like for many, the prospect of having my face crawling with slimy hermaphrodites (snails are unisex) did not immediately appeal. Although from my own research I decided it might be preferable to another natural therapy — 'uguisu no fun,' or nightingale feces facial, which has been around in Japan for centuries. So after being slathered with one of Champeyroux's creams, the beautician plopped down the first of half a dozen mollusks on my face. A balmy coolness I sensed as they proceeded to slide over my cheeks, furrow through my eyebrows and tickle my lips, taking particular liking to my nose since snails are fond of climbing. Opening my eyes, I got a macro lens view of one critter perched on my nose tip. Its twin, antennae-like feelers were weaving about, possibly seeking an escape route with its tiny eyes. The snail's 14,000 microscopic teeth produced a slight, not unpleasant, scratching when it slid toward my nostrils. So if truth be told, I sort of missed my harmless, sensuous sextet when they were dislodged, clinging to my skin with a gentle suction. Maybe I won't eat another escargot again.","The 45-minute facial at Chiang Mai's Snail Spa sees six of the mollusks placed on the customer's face .

"A 'zombie cat' who was run over by a car only to inexplicably return from the dead five days later has successfully undergone surgery on his injuries. Bart, a black and white cat from Tampa, Florida, had an eye removed and jaw repaired by the Tampa Bay Veterinary Emergency Service on Tuesday. He is expected to complete an amazing recovery and should be able to return home to his owner in the coming weeks. Scroll down for video . A 'zombie cat' who was run over by a car only to inexplicably return from the dead five days later has successfully undergone surgery on his injuries . Bart, a black and white cat from Tampa, Florida, had an eye removed and jaw repaired by the Tampa Bay Veterinary Emergency Service on Tuesday . Bart shocked owner Ellis Hutson when he showed up back at home five days after an apparently fatal accident. Unable to afford to fees for Bart’s operation, Hutson had then reached out to the Humane Society of Tampa Bay. Through the Save-A-Pet Medical Fund they were able help cover costs of surgery on brave Bart who had been through quite an ordeal. Hutson had found his pet in a pool of blood in the street, not moving, after a collision earlier this month. Bart is expected to complete an amazing recovery and should be able to return home to his owner in the coming weeks . Zombie cat: Bart, pictured above waiting for surgery, was run down by a car in Tampa, Florida, and buried - but apparently returned from the dead after five days . Unable to afford to fees for Bart’s operation, owner Ellis Hutson had then reached out to the Humane Society of Tampa Bay . 'Living dead': The cat boasted gruesome injuries after his return, and has had surgery to remove his eye, but is expected to return home . Whence he rose: Bart was buried in this shallow hole not far from his home, by Hutson's friend David Liss . But despite having him buried in a shallow dirt grave, Hutson saw him again just five days later - albeit with gruesome wounds and a ruined eye, which has now been removed. Vets were baffled by Bart's mysterious survival - but Hutson believes his revival may be the doing of his brother and playmate. Speaking to local news station Fox13 about the strange happening, he suggested that Bart's friend may have gone looking for him and clawed him out of his resting place. He said: 'We have two cats and they play together all the time and they roam around with each other. 'He might have went looking for his brother and dug him up - but I have no idea'. Life after death: Bart has been given surgery to repair his broken jaw, and is seen above recovering . Patching up: Bart's surgery was covered by the Humane Society of Tampa Bay . Post-op: The cat was treated for its broken jaw and is expected to recover and live out its normal lifespan . Bewildered: Bart's owner, Ellis Hutson, left, was shocked to see his pet return. David Liss, right, was equally stunned to see the feline alive . The mystery deepened when Hutson revealed that he was so upset by his pet's apparent demise that he did not bury Bart himself - but asked his friend David Liss to do the deed. Liss said he had no idea how Bart could have been alive. He told Fox13: 'I looked at it, and I looked at it, and I didn't see the chest moving up and down or anything and I said, ""you know, well look at the blood, it's dead.""' Experts believe Bart rose from the grave not long after being buried there - but was scared so stayed away from home for several days.","Bart has successfully undergone surgery to have his eye removed and jaw repaired .

"This is the shocking moment that an RAC patrol man was hit by a lorry swerving off a motorway. Mark Wootton ‘miraculously’ survived the hit-and-run crash but was left in agony and suffered a broken back as a result of the crash on the M6 in Birmingham. The 40-year-old recovery worker, who suffered two fractured vertebrae in the crash nine months ago, had gone to the aid of a stricken motorist when he was knocked by the lorry. Scroll down for video . On camera: This is the moment that an RAC patrol man was hit by a lorry (right) swerving off a motorway . Hit-and-run: Recovery driver Mark Wootton (left) is seen securing a vehicle in an emergency refuge area - narrowly avoiding being killed by lorry driver Terence Poolman (right) Terence Poolman, 69, of Shifnal, Shropshire, who admitted causing serious injury by dangerous driving, was jailed for eight months this week. He was also banned from the roads for two years. Judge Melbourne Inman QC said: ‘The incident is caught graphically on the motorway CCTV. ‘From the video it is quite clear that your vehicle veered from the inside lane and it carried all the way across to the hard shoulder and then into, to some degree, the emergency refuge area.’ ‘Mr Wootton was in the process of arranging to tow the stricken vehicle away and was kneeling down, protruding a little to the off side of the vehicle, when your vehicle swept past. ‘You hit him. It is miraculous he was not even more seriously injured or possibly killed. You only missed hitting both vehicles by what appeared to be a matter of inches.’ The judge said Mr Wootton still suffered from pain and added that it was unclear if he would be able to return to his employment as an emergency recovery driver because of the ‘terrifying ordeal’. Crash: The judge said Mr Wootton still suffered from pain and added that it was unclear if he would be able to return to his employment as an emergency recovery driver because of the ‘terrifying ordeal’ Astonishing: Poolman (in the yellow vehicle) veered in an arc, and struck the patrol man before carrying on . He added that Poolman, who did not realise he had hit the patrol man, must have been distracted. Mark Phillips, prosecuting at Birmingham Crown Court, said that on April 28 last year Mr Wootton had been called to a breakdown between junctions six and seven on the motorway. Driver: Terence Poolman, 69, of Shifnal, Shropshire, who admitted causing serious injury by dangerous driving, was jailed for eight months this week . Mr Wootton towed the vehicle from the hard shoulder to the refuge area and had been between it and his van when he was attaching safety lights. Poolman, who was driving a low loader towing a dumper truck, veered in an arc, and struck the patrol man before carrying on. Another driver who stopped at the scene described Mr Wootton, who was on the floor, ‘screaming in agony’. X-rays revealed the fractures and he was discharged from hospital the following day. Mr Phillips said the lorry was traced to a depot in Shifnal - and Poolman, who had a previous conviction for causing death by reckless driving in 1970, was arrested. Laura Culley, defending, said: ‘It is a mystery to him to this day how this occurred.’ She said he had not been speeding or tired and that he had undergone a medical assessment which had not revealed any problem. PC David Gaunt, who led the hunt for the hit-and-run driver said: ‘Without a registration number, we knew it would be almost impossible to bring the driver to justice. ‘The only lead we had was a branded catering van seen travelling directly behind Poolman’s lorry. ‘We knew it was a long shot, but we decided to contact the company and ask them if any of their drivers had witnessed the incident and crucially, taken down the registration. ‘Astonishingly, one of them contacted us to say he had done and from there, we were able to trace Poolman. ‘The recovery driver is extremely lucky to be alive and the consequences of Poolman’s complete lack of attention that day could have been a lot worse. 'The victim remains in a lot of pain and has been unable to work since the crash. The impact of his injuries will stay with him for the rest of his life and he worries about what kind of work he will be able to do in the future.’","Mark Wootton survived hit-and-run crash on M6 but suffered broken back .

"Details of former New York Knicks stars and sports commentator Greg Anthony's recent arrest for soliciting an undercover cop have been released and reveal the events of the evening. A police report shows that Anthony reached out to the officer through the website Backpage.com on January 16, and had them meet him at the Doubletree Hotel in Washington, DC where he was staying. Then, after agreeing on a cost of $80 for sex, Anthony told the officer he wanted them to dress up. A police report from Greg Anthony's (above) January 16 arrest for solicitation reveals he was set to pay $80 for sex and wanted the undercover officer posing as a prostitute to dress up . He is married to Dr. Chere Lucas Anthony (above), a dermatologist, and the couple have a 10-month-old daughter . The Washington Post ran a copy of the report, which also shows how brief the meeting between Anthony and the officer was. The officer arrived a little after 5:45pm, and almost immediately says to Anthony; 'So $80 for intercourse?' Anthony is caught off guard, saying he does not want to talk about that, to which the officer responds; 'I just need to know so I don’t have any surprises.' They then ask of Antony would like to have intercourse or oral sex, to which he says; 'Ummm yeah that's fine.' Finally, just before backup is called in, the officer asks; 'You want me to dress up?' 'Oh yeah,' says Anthony. He is now scheduled to appear in court on February 2 and faces a misdemeanor charge of solicitation. Anthony was in town that weekend to announce an NCAA game between Michigan State and Maryland for CBS. The network, and Turner Sports, quickly announced they would be suspending Anthony. 'Greg Anthony will not be working again for CBS this season,' said a spokesperson. 'I made a mistake,' Anthony said in a statement. 'With this lapse of judgment, I embarrassed many, including myself. I will work to regain the trust that I have lost, and the first step is saying that I am sorry.' Anthony (43 above) when he played for the Detroit Pistons . Anthony, 47, started his NBA career with the Knicks and played in New York for four years before being picked up by the Vancouver Grizzlies in the 1995 NBA expansion draft. He finished with the Milwaukee Bucks after 11 seasons in the NBA, averaging 7.3 points per game over his entire career. Anthony has also been politically involved, appearing in a Nevada campaign ad for Mitt Romney during his 2012 presidential bid, calling the Republican Party nominee a 'no excuse kind of guy.' He is married to Dr. Chere Lucas Anthony, a dermatologist, and the couple have a 10-month-old daughter. Anthony also has three other children from previous relationships.","Greg Anthony was arrested for soliciting an undercover cop in Washington DC on January 16 .

"Loretta Lynch is promising a fresh relationship with law enforcement – and with Congress – as she appears before a Senate committee Wednesday in her bid to become the nation's first female black attorney general. But she has serious hurdles in front of her as the Senate Judiciary Committee, now under Republican control, warns about 'a Department of Justice that is deeply politicized' under the outgoing AG, Eric Holder. Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, the committee's chairman, said in his opening statement that America's next top law enforcer would need to worry about 'restoring respect for the co-equal branches of government.' In the first confirmation hearing under the GOP-led Senate, Lynch appeared Wednesday for the first of two days of hearings on her nomination. She's widely expected to win confirmation but faces tough questions from a GOP that's flexing its post-election muscles. Grassley said in Wednesday's hearing that 'the Attorney General’s job is to represent the American People – not just the president and not just the executive branch.' Attorney General nominee Loretta Lynch faces the first confirmation hearing under the new Republican Senate. Her nomination raised eyebrows when it emerged that she once co-founded a college sorority with the future wife of the outgoing AG, Eric Holder . Power Troika: Lynch (left) prepared for a grilling as Senate Judiciary Committee chair Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa (right) and Ranking Minority Member Patrick Leahy of Vermont (center) readied their jousts . That was a jab at the Oval Office and President Barack Obama's recent expansion of its power with executive action on immigration and other hot-button issues. Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, from Lynch's home state of New York, introduced her at the tense Capitol Hill hearing by warning that 'the president's immigration policies aren't seeking confirmation today. Loretta Lynch is.' 'If we can't confirm Loretta Lynch, we can't confirm anyone,' Schumer said. Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, the committee's ranking Democrat, used his moment in the spotlight on Wednesday to warn that Lynch will need to deal with the Bureau of Prisons as it bulges with convicts placed behind bars because of mandatory-minimum sentences that he said don't make America safer. He also condemned 'dragnet surveillance programs directed at American citizens' and looked ahead to June when three sections of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act are set to expire. 'We must protect our national security and our civil liberties,' Leahy said. Lynch, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, expects to replace Eric Holder, who announced his resignation last fall after leading the Justice Department for six years. Holder has been a lightning rod for conservative criticism, clashing with Republicans and becoming the first sitting attorney general held in contempt of Congress . Lynch introduced her husband to the committee on Wednesday, whom she said has 'supported me in all my endeavors, no matter how poor they make us.' In prepared testimony, she pledged better relations with Capitol Hill. 'I look forward to fostering a new and improved relationship with this committee, the United States Senate, and the entire United States Congress – a relationship based on mutual respect and constitutional balance,' Lynch said. Holder also battled the perception from critics that he aligned himself more with protesters of police violence than with members of law enforcement, a charge he and the Justice Department have strongly denied – but one that resonated in the aftermath of high-profile deaths of black men at the hands of white police officers. In her prepared testimony, Lynch promised a fresh start in that relationship, too. 'Few things have pained me more than the recent reports of tension and division between law enforcement and the communities we serve,' Lynch said, pledging to 'work to strengthen the vital relationships' if confirmed. But her ties to Holder have raised concerns among Republicans. At Harvard University in 1980, Lynch co-founded a chapter of the all-black Delta Sigma Theta sorority along with Sharon Malone and nine other college co-eds. Malone is now Holder's wife. Lynch already has earned praise from several GOP senators for her credentials and accomplishments, though. She still face tough questions from Republicans who now control the Senate. The hearing gives them an opportunity to press their opposition to Obama administration policies while showcasing their own governing roles as the 2016 presidential election cycle gets underway. 'She certainly has the credentials. We don't want a repeat of what we had,' said Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, a senior committee member. 'I look upon her as a pretty good appointment, but I have to listen along with everybody else.' TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT? Sharon Malone (left), the wife of outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder (right), co-founded a Harvard sorority with Loretta Lynch in 1980 . Loretta Lynch, poised to become the first black woman to serve as America's attorney general, has been the top federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of New York since 2010 . The Judiciary Committee includes some of the Senate's most outspoken Republicans, among them Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a potential presidential candidate who promised to quiz Lynch on Obama's executive actions on immigration that granted reprieves from deportation to millions. 'We need an attorney general who will stop being a partisan attack dog and instead get back to the traditions of upholding the Constitution and the law in a fair and impartial manner,' Cruz said. Lynch's hearing comes amid a nationwide spotlight on police tactics in the wake of deaths of black men at the hands of white police officers, as well as the slaying last month of two officers in New York City. It's an issue Lynch, 55, is deeply familiar with. She helped prosecute the New York City police officers who severely beat and sexually assaulted Haitian immigrant Abner Louima in 1997. Her office in New York is currently leading a civil rights investigation into the police chokehold death of Eric Garner in Staten Island last summer. Lynch has been the top prosecutor since 2010 for a district that includes Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and Long Island, a role she also held from 1999 to 2001. On a conference call Tuesday, law enforcement officials praised Lynch's nomination. New York Police Commissioner Bill Bratton described her as a 'fair-minded individual' who would be able to navigate sensitive matters of race relations and policing and see both sides. Lynch grew up with humble beginnings in North Carolina, the daughter of a school librarian and a Baptist minister. She went on to receive undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard University. 'I believe in the promise of America because I have lived the promise of America,' she said in her prepared testimony.","Loretta Lynch would be the first black woman to become America's top law enforcement official .

"Banana milkshakes in the pool with his wife and chess on the beach at sunset with his dad... these aren't exactly the images that come to mind when asked to picture a getaway fit for rock 'n roll royalty. But that's exactly how McFly, and now McBusted, star, Harry Judd, likes it. The drummer enjoyed a New Year break with wife of two years, Izzy, and his parents, Emma and Christopher, at  The Inn at English Harbour in Antigua and shared his holiday snaps exclusively with MailOnline. Scroll down for video . McFly, and now McBusted, star, Harry Judd, enjoyed banana milkshakes in the pool with his wife during their getaway to The Inn at English Harbour in Antigua . The pair stayed for 10 days in the exclusive resort, which has only 28 adults-only rooms and is set on a private beach . The sumptuous resort, set on a sprawling 19 acres, is as private as it is luxurious with just 28 rooms and its own private beach. And while there are a host of outdoor pursuits to be enjoyed, sun, sand and good company were all the popstar really needed. 'We're the worst couple in the world for activities,' Judd told MailOnline Travel. 'My idea of a good time on holiday is lying about on the bed, on the beach, reading a book, maybe a round of golf - these are all of my requirements. And Izzy's on the same page too.' The pair were regular, rather photogenic, fixtures poolside where Harry says they enjoyed virgin cocktails - 'usually a banana milkshake, before going back for some more reading.' While the words 'virgin cocktail' can often see ears prick up about the potential pitter patter of tiny feet, this couple - who were married in December 2012, insist that there's nothing to share. They simply don't drink. Though there were plenty of activities to choose from, Judd admits that he and his wife prefer to lounge on the beach . Though the pair has no aversion to kids per se, the resort is adults only, which ensures peace and quiet for its guests. 'Meeting people is a big part of my job but it felt like there was hardly anyone there,' Judd said. 'It was so relaxing and quiet. It's a luxury that just can't be underestimated. It was really nice to have 10 days not having to talk to people.' The couple stayed there from December 30 to January 8. And to ring in 2015, the couple kept things just as low-key as they had during the rest of their holiday. 'We actually went to bed at 10:30pm,' he said. 'There was a band and a few other things going on, but we were tired. It's what we usually do on New Year's.' The two - and Harry's parents - spent New Year's at the resort, but the low-key couple went to bed at 10:30pm . Judd soaked up the short-lived serenity and relaxation - in less than 2 weeks, McBusted will join One Direction on tour in Australia . There's nothing wrong with getting a good night's sleep - and Judd should relish it while he can, since he and the rest of McBusted will soon be embarking on a tour of Australia with One Direction. Also on the pre-tour schedule? Keeping in top shape. 'A resort like this is the one time I can guarantee myself exercise,' Judd explained. 'Just with the routine of getting up early due to the way jetlag works going this way.' But that's not to say Judd spent the entire time in the gym, he also enjoyed getting active outdoors with his dad, Christopher. 'They had a fantastic floodlit tennis court that my dad and I would have a hit on in the afternoon. We give each other a good game, but we just had rallies, so that an argument didn't ruin our holiday.' 'We also got into the habit of playing chess every evening as the sun went down,' he added. 'There are a bunch of boats moored just off the beach that give you a bit more of a view than just of open water, but it's still idyllic.' Harry enjoyed keeping in top shape while away, often swimming and playing a bit of tennis with his dad . Judd and his wife absolutely 'love' the luxurious resort, calling it 'genuinely the perfect holiday' Serenity and relaxation seemed to be the themes of Judd's family getaway. 'I absolutely love the place. It's so serene, quiet and understated - such a peaceful experience.' 'There's not a hint of over-development. It's perfectly comfortable,' he said. 'Genuinely the perfect holiday for us.' 'My parents spent their honeymoon in the Caribbean about 30 years ago and have been back many times since. If they're happy, you know it's good.'","Judd takes MailOnline Travel inside his luxurious Caribbean vacation .

"A newly revealed scrapbook shows an insider's view of how Winston Churchill was laid to rest in a tiny Oxfordshire village almost exactly 50 years ago - in a grave which this week has become the focus of commemoration for the great man. The collection of photographs is owned by 91-year-old Frank Hall, who was a verger at St Martin's church in Bladon, where the wartime Prime Minister was buried. They show preparations for the burial - including Mr Hall mowing the grass around the grave plot and servicemen rehearsing the lowering of Churchill's coffin. Scroll down for video . Yard: The church in Bladon pictured today, almost exactly 50 years after Churchill was buried there in a private ceremony . Respect: The crowds file past the grave in 1965, which was almost overflowing with wreaths and flowers from well-wishers . Transformation: The image on the left shows Churchill's grave in Oxfordshire soon after his burial; it is pictured on the right today, after the gravestone was replaced when his wife Clementine was buried alongside him . Historic: This picture shows servicemen rehearsing Winston Churchill's burial in St Martin's church, Bladon by lowering a coffin into his grave . Arrival: A hearse carrying the former Prime Minister's coffin drives through the village of Bladon, the streets filled with well-wishers . Poignant: Churchill's coffin, wrapped in the Union flag and carried by servicemen, is taken into the churchyard . Other pictures reveal how crowds of people descended on the village for the service, whose 50th anniversary falls on Friday, and members of the public queued for hours for a glimpse of the great man's grave. Today, the public again returned to the Bladon churchyard to pay tribute to the man who led the Allies to victory over Hitler's Germany in the Second World War. Mr Hall was responsible for taking care of the wreaths left at Churchill's grave by his family, and the sea of flowers donated by mourners in the following weeks. He received a letter from the statesman's widow Clementine thanking him for 'looking after my husband's grave', and the note is also in his historic scrapbook. Mr Hall has now donated the book to an exhibition at Churchill's birthplace, Blenheim Palace, which is situated in the town of Woodstock not far from Bladon.

Note: Another note read 'Thank you for liberating Germany, Japan, Italy etc and for keeping the rest of us free. RIP' The former Prime Minister's state funeral in January 1965 took place at St Paul's Cathedral in London before his body was taken to St Martin's via train. The funeral rehearsal depicted in Mr Hall's scrapbook was held two days before the actual ceremony. Mr Hall was a verger at St Martin's between 1961 and 1969 and now lives in the nearby village of Stonesfield with his wife Jean. 'It was always known that Winston Churchill would be buried at Bladon but it never really occurred to me that I might be involved in it,' he said as he revealed his scrapbook for the first time. 'He always said he knew whereabouts he was going to be buried because there was a plot left for him. Preparations: Frank Hall, a verger at St Martin's who has kept this scrapbook for 50 years, mowing the grass in the graveyard . Grave: The plot which had been prepared for Churchill in the graveyard at Bladon, near his birthplace of Blenheim Palace . Plot: The grave was dug in the Churchill family plot when the wartime Prime Minister died aged 90 in January 1965 . Final journey: Churchill's body was transported from St Paul's Cathedral in London to Oxfordshire on this train . Waiting: Hanborough railway station, where the train stopped so that Churchill's body could be taken to Bladon by car . 'The burial was at 3pm and the police closed off the village at 10am to people. Lady Churchill wanted it to be private and it was from the point of the lychgate at the church. 'There were about 30 people around the grave, mostly family. I was at the graveside for the burial, in the corner by the church tower. 'All I had to do was stand there and wait until they had moved on and then the grave diggers came and filled the grave in. 'I had to put the wreaths left by Lady Churchill and the Queen out before all the visitors came. 'The police let the photographers in for 10 minutes and then the crowds started coming and that went on until midnight. Media: These 10 phone boxes were installed for members of the Press to file their reports - conveniently close to the village pub . Anticipation: Villagers lined the streets to pay their respects to the man who was credited with winning the Second World War for the Allies . Procession: The car with Churchill's coffin drove through the streets, as depicted in this photograph from Mr Hall's scrapbook . Photograph: A picture captured from the window of a nearby home shows the coffin being carried in . Funeral party: Friends and relatives of Churchill following the coffin in for the ceremony in the church graveyard . 'The following day the crowds were back. People parked a mile away from the church. I remember speaking to a father carrying a small child who had queued for three hours to see the grave. 'They kept on coming for six weeks and my job was to put the new flowers down and take away the old ones.' Mr Hall had previously met Churchill 20 years earlier, while serving with the 6th Airborne Division in the Second World War. His regiment had just crossed the Rhine into Germany in April 1945 when the Prime Minister arrived in a jeep alongside Field Marshal Montgomery. Crowds: Hundreds if not thousands of members of the public queued up after the burial to pay their respects to Churchill . Queue: Villagers were willing to wait hours for a glimpse of Churchill's final resting place . Night: The mourners continued to come until well after dark, testament to the affection in which Churchill was held by the public . Love: A wreath from Churchill's wife Clementine, who signed herself 'Clemmie', was placed on his grave . Mr Hall, who fought in the Battle of Normandy in June 1944 and the Battle of the Bulge in 1945, said: 'He had a trilby hat on and a cigar in his mouth and he gave his V for victory sign.' After being demobbed in 1947, Mr Hall worked as a delivery driver and then for for a local sand and gravel company before becoming a verger at St Martin's. The Churchill Exhibition at Blenheim Palace will open on February 14. Tribute: Robert F. Kennedy, brother of the murdered President JFK, visited Churchill's grave in 1967 .

"Taiwan has banned children under the age of two from using  electronic devices such as iPads, televisions and smartphones. Parents who allow their young children to play with their gadgets face fines of up to £1,000, in line with a law passed last week. The new law also states that parents must ensure that under-18s only use electronic products for a 'reasonable' length of time. Scroll down for video . No more iNanny: Parents in Taiwan are now completely banned from allowing their under-twos to use any electronic devices, such as tablets, smartphones or TVs or they risk  a £1,000 fine . Taiwanese lawmakers passed the new legislation last Friday, completely banning parents from allowing their under-twos to use any electronic devices, China's official news agency Xinhua reports. Meanwhile Taiwanese under-18s are not allowed to 'constantly use electronic products for a period of time that is not reasonable', although the 'reasonable length of time' has not been defined. The new law means that iPads, smartphones and televisions are now listed alongside cigarettes and alcohol as restricted. The new law was originally proposed by Taiwanese MP Lu Shiow-yen, who said his intention was to protect young people by stopping them using electronic devices for more than 30 minutes at a time, The Telegraph reports. Research published in December last year found that 7.1 per cent of the population in Asia is addicted to the internet. Screens off: Taiwanese under-18s are no longer allowed to 'constantly use electronic products for a period of time that is not reasonable' under new legislation . In neighbouring China, online addiction among young people has become a serious problem, with an estimated 24million children considered 'web junkies'. As well as introducing laws requiring games companies 'to develop techniques that would limit the gaming time of minors', more than 250 military style boot camps have been set up across China to tackle under-18 internet addiction. Since the release of the first iPad in 2010, an ever increasing number of parents use the Apple device to 'babysit' their children. A recent poll found that half of British parents routinely allow infants to play with their smartphone or tablet, and one in seven let them spend more than four hours a day on hand-held devices. Even Prince William recently admitted to letting Prince George play games on his iPad, saying that he believes it is 'a good way to each him the inner workings of electronics'. Research published in the British Medical Journal found that a child born today will have spent a full year staring at screens (tablets, computers, TVs) by the time they reach seven.","Children under two banned from using electronic devices in Taiwan .

"GP Richard Holmes was four times over the drink drive limit when he crashed his car on the way to work . A doctor who was four times over the drink drive limit crashed his convertible on the way to work while driving with the roof down in heavy rain, a court heard. GP Richard Holmes had just four hours sleep when he got behind the wheel of his Saab after a night drinking. The 55-year-old was on his way to his surgery when he careered into the back of another vehicle at traffic lights in East Boldon, South Tyneside. As he staggered out of his Saab  the other driver noticed he'd been travelling with his roof down despite 'driving wind and rain'. When arrested he recorded a breath test reading of 137 mcg of alcohol in 100ml of breath - the legal limit being 35mcg. Holmes had drunk a quarter of a bottle of wine just four hours before he shunted into the back of the other car. The medic, of East Boldon, admitted a charge of driving with excess alcohol when he appeared before South Tyneside Magistrates Court. He was warned he could have faced jail but was  sentenced to a 26-week electronically tagged curfew, as well as being banned from driving for three years. Jonathan Moore, prosecuting, said the incident occurred at about 9am on January 12. 'The driver of a Nissan Juke described putting on his handbrake to stop at traffic lights when he heard a loud bang,' he said. 'A Saab vehicle had crashed into the back of his car. The roof of the vehicle was down, which he thought odd due to the high winds and rain. 'He asked the driver (the defendant) what he was playing at. Holmes staggered out of the vehicle. 'The witness asked him if he had been drinking, Holmes replied 'I need to get to work'. He asked him again and he said he had not been drinking. 'Police noted Holmes' eyes were glazed, he smelt of alcohol. They asked him when he had last had alcohol, he said at 5am. 'He said he had drank a quarter of a bottle of wine and had a bottle of wine the night previous.' Holmes, who has worked for 27 years as a GP at Talbot Medical Centre, in South Shields, admitted he had drank a bottle of wine to himself the night before. The court heard that Holmes is attending an NHS alcohol support service, as well as a support group for doctors and dentists with alcohol problems. Geoffrey Forrester, defending, said: 'Dr Holmes is a decent man, he is someone who can be described as being of positive, good character. 'He has served the community as a GP, doing what is a stressful job. There is a sadness for all concerned that he finds himself in court. 'His alcohol issues have crept up on him. He didnt have a concept of the extent of his alcohol dependence until this happened. He has sought help immediately. 'He has not been struck off, but is suspended from work. It is hoped that in time, hopefully a short period of time, he will be able to resume his role in the caring profession he has contributed so much to. 'It has taken this incident to make him realise the grip that alcohol has taken on him and as soon as this happened he has taken steps to address that issue.' Holmes was sentenced to a 26-week electronically monitored curfew at South Shield Magistrates Court, pictured above, after admitting drink driving. He was also banned from the roads for three years by magistrates . Nicola Burns, chair of the magistrates, said: 'For this offence we can look at anything from a community order up to 26 weeks in custody. 'The offence is increased in seriousness due to the time of day it took place, when other motorists and pedestrians were around, and the fact you were involved in an accident could have pushed us to the custody bracket. 'We have taken into consideration the fact you have entered an immediate guilty plea, are of previous good character and have shown remorse, this brings it down to a community sentence.' Holmes was hit with a 26-week curfew, operating from 8pm to 8am each day, as well as a 36-month driving disqualification. He must also pay £85 court costs and a £60 victim surcharge. Stacey Kean, Practice Manager at Talbot Medical Centre, said: 'Dr Holmes is currently on long-term leave. Arrangements have been put in place to ensure patient care is not affected.'","GP Richard Holmes, 55, crashed his Saab on the way to his surgery .

"A puppy that disappeared more than five months ago was saved from Winter Storm Juno and is home safe and sound thanks to the efforts of a New York City firefighter. Burt, a brindle-colored whippet, went missing from his owner in August in Morningside Heights. A Fire Department of New York firefighter spotted Burt in the last three weeks near the FDNY training facility on Randall's Island and nicknamed the one-year-old dog, which he thought was a scraggly-looking greyhound, 'The Rock'. Scroll down for video . Burt (pictured) vanished about five months ago in Morningside Heights. He was rescued on Tuesday . The whippet puppy would snuggle with his owner (left) before he went missing. Burt pictured (right) after his rescue . Firefighter David Kelly displays the cage he used to catch Burt  at the FDNY's Randall's Island training facility . FDNY firefighter David Kelly became worried about Burt because of the approaching snowstorm and decided to set a trap for him, even though previous efforts to catch him had failed. Kelly said: 'Every time I'd go up to him, he'd run off.' The firefighter, who had been putting out canned dog cuisine for Burt in the same spot every night, set a trap by placing food in a cage and attaching a rope to the door. His first attempt to catch Burt was a failure but Kelly was able to secure the skinny puppy in the cage on his second try. 'It was pretty tricky,' Kelly told the New York Post. 'I was going to let him eat a while, in case it didn't work, so he could at least get some food in him.' After scanning the web for pictures of missing whippets, Kelly came across the Facebook page titled 'Bring Burt Home'. He did just that after reaching out to owner Lauren Piccolo. Kelly said: 'As soon as he saw his owner, the dog started wagging his tail, licking her.' Burt is resting at home and is expected to make a full recovery thanks to the efforts of Kelly . After Burt went missing in August, his owner made posters and created the 'Bring Burt Home' Facebook page . Piccolo thanked the FDNY and Kelly for bringing her 'devilishly handsome' and 'bashful' dog back to her. 'I am tremendously grateful for the efforts of the FDNY to recover Burt,' she said in a statement released by the department. 'While Burt is a resilient dog, I don't think he would have survived such a fierce storm. 'The FDNY's efforts were incredible and timely.' Burt is resting at home and is expected to make a full recovery. Kelly said: 'They were very excited to have their dog back and the dog was even more excited. 'I don't like to see an animal or person suffering, so I was just glad to help.'","Whippet puppy Burt went missing in Morningside Heights last August .

"In the hour after a teenager was allegedly raped in a park by a 51-year-old man, she was found crouched up in a ball, make-up smeared over her face and twigs in her hair. 'She was just crying. Hysterical. Her hair was all messy, she smelt of vomit. She didn't look good at all,' her friend told Sydney's District Court on Wednesday. The crown alleges the heavily intoxicated 18-year-old was repeatedly sexually assaulted by Joseph Stephen Rosenburg in Sydney's Hyde Park in the early hours of August 30, 2013. The man is accused of indecently assaulting the teenager outside a Sydney building, before following her into Hyde Park and forcing her to have oral and anal sex. A Sydney court has heard that a 51-year-old man forced a teenager to have anal sex in Hyde Park . The girl's friend found her by St James Station near Hyde Park . He has pleaded not guilty to three counts of sexual intercourse without consent and three charges of indecent assault. At the second day of his trial, a friend of the teenager, who cannot be named, said she had become concerned for the 18-year-old after receiving a text that was 'gibberish'. After finally getting in touch with her, the friend said she told her to wait outside Starbucks on Park Street and she would pick her up. As she drove into the city to collect the teenager, she told the jury she tried repeatedly to call her friend again. The 18-year-old allegedly sent a series of illegible texts to her friends asking for help . On the ninth call, she said the teenager picked up. 'She was hysterical, just crying and saying, `He hurt me, he hurt me' ... She said, `He raped me'.' The friend said she found the 18-year-old outside St James Station, lying in a ball, crouched up. 'Her make-up was smeared all over her face. There were scratches high up on her legs. 'When she saw me she cried and grabbed my arm and didn't want to let go.' The court heard from another of the teenager's friends, who she had been partying with at a bar on Oxford Street earlier that evening. The friend told the court that the 18-year-old had consumed around 750ml of vodka from a bottle in less than half an hour. Shortly after, she said the 18-year-old went missing from the club. On the first day of the trial, the court heard the teenager had been out with friends at a bar on Oxford Street and after leaving in a taxi with an unnamed man, was left lying on the side of street after she was sick in the vehicle. It is alleged that Joseph Stephen Rosenburg came up to her and put his hand up her dress, and followed her into Hyde Park where she went in an attempt to escape him. The court heard the teenager had consumed excessive amounts of vodka after being sick in a taxi . The 18-year-old lay down near a tree, suffering the effects of excessive alcohol, and was followed by Rosenburg who allegedly came up to her and began touching her. 'Are you going to kill me?' she allegedly asked him. 'No, I'm not going to kill you if you go with it,' he allegedly replied. She allegedly sent her friends a series of illegible texts to her friends pleading for help, including 'I'm being tapes (sic), help'. Rosenburg was arrested in March 2014 with his DNA matching forensic samples found on her underwear, the court heard. Rosenburg's barrister Ken Averre said it wasn't disputed his client had oral sex with the teenager, but that the question of consent was in question. Mr Averre said that Rosenburg denied having anal sex with the 18-year-old. The trial continues.

"More than 800 million men living today are descended from just eleven men, including the ruthless Mongolian leader Genghis Khan, according to new research. Geneticists have been able to find eleven distinctive sequences in Y-chromosomes - the chunk of DNA that is only carried by men - that are persistent in modern populations in Asia. By systematically analysing the DNA of more than 5,000 men, they have been able to trace these male lineages to their approximate 'founding fathers'. This map shows ten of the 11 lineages (labelled DC) with the approximate date when they originated and how they appear to have spread around the continent. The arrows show how the lineage may have spread . They found that along with Khan, who is reputed to have sired hundreds of children as his hoards cut a swathe across much of Asia, they traced ten other lineages. These are thought to originate from the Middle East to Southeast Asia between 2100BC and 1100AD. They found that 37.8 per cent of the 5,000 men they tested belonged to one of these eleven lineages. Scientists are using space-age technology to help them find the final resting place of the first Mongolian emperor Genghis Khan. Although he ruled an empire that extended over most of Asia, the final resting place of the Mongol leader remains a mystery. He died in 1227 at the age of 72 after a sudden illness. Legend says that as his body was carried to its final resting place, anyone encountered along the route was put to the sword before those escorting the body also killed themselves, to keep its location a secret. Researchers at the University of California have used crowdsourcing to scour more than 84,000 satellite images of a part of Mongolia where his body is suspected to be. By searching an area of 2,316 square miles, they have been able to identify 55 potential sites for where the great Mongol warlords body may now lie. If this is reflected in the entire Asian population, then it could mean around 830 million men living in Asia currently owe their Y-chromosomes to one of these eleven men. Among them is a lineage that has previously been attributed to a Chinese ruler called Giocangga, who died in 1583 and whose grandson founded the Qing Dynasty that ruled China between 1644 and 1912. Giocangga is thought to have had many children with his wives and concubines and is the direct male ancestor of more than 1.5 million men. The researchers also found that another of the lineages appears to have population clusters that are concentrated along the Silk Road trading route and date back to around 850AD. This suggests they may have their origins among the powerful rulers who dominated the steppes where the route passed - the Khitan, Tangut Xia, Juchin, Kara-Khitan and Mongol empires. The researchers suggest that Abaoji, Emperor Taizu of Liao and the Great Khan of the Khitans, who died in 926AD in the Khitan area of China, is a possible candidate for the father of this lineage. Professor Mark Jobling, a geneticist at the University of Leicester who led the work, which is published in the European Journal of Human Genetics, said that more research was needed before they could identify the individuals. The founding fathers who lived between 2100BC and 300BC appear to have existed in both sedentary agricultural societies and nomadic tribes, he added. Genghis Khan is thought to have fathered hundreds of children as his armies conquered much of Asia while his sons also continued to spread his Y-chromosome around the world as they expanded the Mongol empire . Writing in the European of Human Genetics, he said: 'High reproductive success is often associated with high social status, ‘prestigious’ men having higher intramarital fertility, lower offspring mortality and access to a greater than average number of wives. 'Those with recent origins in the historical period are almost exclusively found in Altaic-speaking pastoral nomadic populations, which may reflect a shift in political organisation in pastoralist economies and a greater ease of transmission of Y-chromosomes through time and space facilitated by the use of horses. 'New social systems and economic adaptations emerged after horse domestication. 'Horse-riding greatly enhanced both east–west connections and north–south trade between Siberia and southerly regions, and allowed new techniques of warfare, a key element explaining the successes of mobile pastoralists in their conflicts with more sedentary societies.' One of the male lineages that have come to dominate in Asia appears to have originated from one of the empires that sprung up along the Silk Route, depicted here in this Catalan nautical map from 1325-1387 . The researchers analysed the Y chromosomes of 5,321 men from 127 different populations around Asia. They found 11 common Y chromosome sequences that cropped up repeatedly in the genomes they examined. By searching these for distinctive random mutations that accumulate over time they were able to estimate roughly when these Y chromosome sequences originated. Giocangga, grandfather of the Qing ruler Emperor Nurhaci (above), is thought to be directly related to 1.5 million men now living in China and Mongolia . Looking at the distribution of these sequences in the populations they tested also allowed them to estimate where they may have originated by looking for clusters. Previous research conducted in 2003 had shown that almost 16 million men across the world could be related to the Mongol leader Genghis Khan, who died in 1227. Scientists traced a cluster of extremely similar Y-chromosomes back to a single ancestor living in Mongolia around 800 years ago. They believe the only man with the opportunity to father enough children would have been the Mongolian warlord. Within 80 years he built an empire that covered much of China, Iran, Pakistan, Korea and South Russia. The empire he founded went on to stretch across much of Asia and into Europe, meaning there was potential for his descendants to spread his genes far and wide. Tom Robinson, an accountancy professor whose ancestors came from the Lake District, was the first man outside Asia to be identified as carrying the Khan chromosome. It was found that Professor Robinson's paternal forebears came from the Caucasus near the Black Sea. Similar work found Giocangga was also the most probably origin of another distinct Y chromosome found in modern China and Mongolia. However, tracing the other dominant Y chromosomes to other individuals will require similar educated guesswork by looking for men who had the power and potential to sire large numbers of children at around the right time that the sequences are found to originally occur. Genghis Khan was the founder and Great Khan of the Mongol Empire. In the early 1200s he united the . tribes, creating a military state that invaded its neighbours and . expanded, soon ruling most of what would become modern Korea, China, . Russia, eastern Europe, southeast Asia, Persia and India. Khan made himself master of half the known world, and inspired mankind with a fear that lasted for generations. He . was a prolific lover, fathering hundreds of children across his . territories. Some scientists think he has 16 million male descendants . alive today. By the time he died in August 1227, the Mongol Empire covered a vast part of Central Asia and China. Originally known as Temüjin of the Borjigin, legend has it Genghis was born holding a clot of blood in his hand. His father was Khan, or emperor, of a small tribe but was murdered when Temüjin was still young. The new tribal leader wanted nothing to do with Temujin's family, so with his mother and five other children, Temüjin was cast out and left to die. In all, Genghis conquered almost four times the lands of Alexander the Great. He is still revered in Mongolia and in parts of China. One of the 'founding fathers' appears to have lived in what is now northern Turkey in 700BC while another came from Iran in around 1100AD. Others seem to originate around 2100BC and 1500BC in southeast Asia. Around this time farming populations were moving down through Burma into Laos, Thailand and Cambodia, leading to the Mon and Khmer empires. The only way to know for sure who these 11 founding fathers were will be to find their remains and extract DNA. If the tomb of leaders like Genghis Khan are ever unearthed, it could result in the ultimate paternity test for millions of men around the world. Chris Tyler-Smith, an evolutionary geneticist now at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Hinxton, UK, who led that orginal study in 2003, told Nature: 'Looking for these links is fascinating. 'When we did it, we were using pretty indirect lines of reasoning, and you could try and do that with each of these lineages. 'What I really hope is that at some point someone will find Genghis Khan's tomb and remains.'","Scientists from the University of Leicester traced DNA in modern men to 'founding fathers' that lived across Asia between 1300BC and 1100AD .

"Hospitals hired doctors from at least 27 countries last year including Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Qatar and Australia. Most were used to plug desperate staffing shortages on wards, X-ray units and overstretched A&E departments. Experts say the health service has no choice as it has failed to train enough of its own doctors to meet the needs of the rising and aging population. The situation is the same for other front line staff and nearly 6,000 nurses were recruited from overseas last year, many from Spain and Portugal. The NHS has no choice but to recruit foreign doctors as it has failed to train enough of its own staff to meet the needs of the rising and aging population, experts warned today . And figures uncovered this week show that ambulance services last year hired 180 paramedics, mainly from Australia, and plan to recruit more over the next few months. Figures obtained by the Guardian under the Freedom of Information Act show that 32 out of 160 hospital trusts recruited 321 doctors from abroad last year, from 27 different countries. The true number is likely to be far higher as many trusts failed to respond. Separate figures from the General Medical Council show that 2, 957 doctors who trained oversees joined the register last year. But it is not possible to say how many of these subsequently got jobs within he NHS. Southampton hired the most, at 113, while Northern Lincolnshire and Goole is planning to hire 83 this year. Dr David Rosser, medical director of University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, one of England’s biggest trusts, said: ‘The NHS doesn’t have the number of doctors it needs. ‘The shortage is real. We aren’t training enough doctors in this country, and so we are dependent on foreign-trained doctors. ‘Doctors in more and more branches of medicine report shortages, especially in specialities such as A&E, where it’s tough work.’ He said it would take at least ten years to train-up enough British doctors. GPs take ten years to train while consultants take 13 including, five years at university. The shortages are particularly severe in A&E and radiology, where doctors analyse X-rays and scans for cancer and other illnesses . The shortages are particularly severe in A&E and radiology, where doctors analyse X-rays and scans for cancer and other illnesses. Dr Giles Maskell, president of the Royal College of Radiologists said: ‘We are very short of radiologists. 'The main implications for patient safety are delays in scan interpretation and the risks of people getting the wrong treatment, or no treatment, due to not getting the right tests or expert interpretation.’ Most doctors hired from overseas are hospital specialists but a small proportion are likely to have been GPs, and many surgeries are also very short-staffed. One of those recently recruited was Dr Rensy Mathew, 39, from Qatar, who plans to stay for four years working in A&E at the University Hospital of North Durham. Southampton hired the most, at 113, while Northern Lincolnshire and Goole is planning to hire 83 this year. Southampton General Hospital is pictured . He was hired following two recruitment fairs in India and the United Arab Emirates respectively which involved interviews and a role-play exercise. He said: ‘The biggest difference [from Qatar] I would say I noticed is, things are more streamlined. ‘Everyone follows a system, everything goes in a flowchart way.' ‘People are very eager to know where I have come from and what’s my background, they are very courteous, very welcoming and quite keen to know what I have to say and what advice I have to give’ A spokesman for the Department of Health said: ‘In the last five years we have seen an increase in British staff working in the NHS from 88.9 per cent to 89.1 per cent and crucially we have more clinical staff overall – 9,500 extra doctors and 7,800 extra nurses on our wards. ‘Foreign health workers make a valuable contribution to the NHS, but we have introduced language checks to ensure they can properly communicate with their patients.’","Countries recruited from included Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Qatar and Australia .

The video was filmed by the  organisation Animal Care Gambia after holidaymaker Dr. Michael Meyer, from Berlin, realised there were no facilities to look after them and set up a veterinary surgery in 2009. The puppy was brought it after a German ex-pat spotted it on the streets of Sukuta and realised it needed treatment. Mangoworm infestations, caused by the mango fly laying eggs and larvae growing under the skin of animals, is a key problem in Gambia. This young visitor in particular was lucky to be picked up by the caring vets, after becoming riddled with thousands of the maggots. Squeezing out the worms, measuring between 3-4mm in diameter, the vet films the procedure as the puppy whimpers in the background. The larvae of the  parasite, known by its scientific name Cordylobia Anthropophaga, settle under the skin of hosts, both animal and human, and grow there until they can emerge and drop off. The young puppy is clearly in distress as the worms are squeezed from under its skin . Close-up from the video show the sizeable parasites emerging from the dog's wounds . With one woman counting in the background, the video shows 50 worms being squeezed from the distressed puppy's leg in the space of just a couple of minutes. The vet then moves on to release more worms from the puppy's stomach and other legs. The veterinary surgery told MailOnline: 'They are very common in Gambia, every dog and gets them sooner or later. The puppy is estimated to be six weeks old and was found on the streets of the Greater Banjul Area . 'Usually the infestation is not bad, adult dogs can stand up to 100 maggots without being seriously affected. You will see/feel a lump under the skin and have to squeeze it out once the maggot is 3-4mm in diameter. To squeeze before won't work as the maggot has spikes and holds on to its host.' The surgery spokesperson goes on to explain: 'They have to come out, that's the only way. Either when they are ready and fully developed by themselves, or by the owner/caretaker before that. 'The problem is that owner/caretaker often does not give a sh** or does not exist, we have a huge amount of dogs on the streets of the Gambia. That's my main work.' The vat can be heard explaining that removing parasites is one of the most common jobs he performs . The charitable veterinary surgery aims to educate and raise money to tackle issues in Gambia by uploading the videos to YouTube, where the surgeons and assistants have a loyal group of followers. Commenting under the video, which has had more than four million views, animal lovers worry about the outcome for the young dog. A user called Angel Isthyname wrote: 'Poor puppy I'm crying hearing his pain squeals.' Keenan Lee added: 'Really wish they had a follow up story on this puppy. Hope the little guy made it and found a good home.' The poor puppy is just one of many that is brought in to the surgery by concerned holidaymakers . And SimulatorWave wrote: 'Oh my gosh, that poor little dog. I'm so glad they took the time to help it.' Further video showing how the surgery deals with other animal issues can be viewed on YouTube and more information can be found at animalcaregambia.com . The veterinary charity explains on its website: 'We are a group of like minded people, concerned with the welfare of beach and street animals in The Gambia. 'We are based in The Greater Banjul Area of The Gambia which is the most densely populated area with many tourists visiting during the season – October to April.'","Six-week-old puppy brought in to clinic by worried German in Gambia .

"On trial: Gary Glitter, 70, (pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court yesterday) has apologised for the first time for having a hoard of child porn . Gary Glitter has revealed his shock at discovering that his only daughter Sarah had been fathered by his best friend, a court heard. The glam rocker told his child sex trial said that his eldest son Paul dropped the bombshell after working out that he could not be the father. It came after he broke down in tears at Southwark Crown court as he apologised for the first time for having a hoard of child pornography and said his life was ruined he was jailed for possessing 4,000 indecent images of children. The disgraced glam rock star begged forgiveness for his ‘curiosity’ after he was caught with 4,000 images showing a ‘full range of sexual activity taking place between adult men and very young children’ 17 years ago. Giving evidence yesterday Glitter told the jury his former wife Ann had an affair with his best friend during the Sixties before they divorced. He said he now believed that his daughter Sarah, who is now 49, was not his own. He said: ‘I really did not see Sarah at all much. I am ashamed. ‘She didn’t, I think, want to see me because I was not her real father.’ The revelation stunned prosecutor, John Price, QC, who asked: ‘What do you mean?’ Glitter replied: ‘Paul pointed out that she was not. I was living in Germany at the time. My son Paul said I was not the father. ‘I think my wife Ann was having an affair with my best friend and I believe to this day he is her father. She is not my natural daughter’. Earlier the father of three said he was ‘ashamed’ he had not spent enough time with his children due to his career. Glitter has admitted that he was barely at home because of his frequent concert tours. Glitter married in 1963. Paul was born the following year and Sarah in 1966. He divorced Ann in 1972. Yesterday, in a series of dramatic courtroom confessions, Glitter, 70, told how he had been abused as a boy. He also stunned jurors as he revealed his shock discovery that his only daughter was fathered by his best friend – whom he claimed had an affair with his wife in the late Sixties. Glitter is on trial for alleged sex attacks on three children during the late Seventies and the Eighties. The admissions came as he was questioned by John Price QC, prosecuting, about why he had subscribed to two Japanese porn sites to download child abuse images. They were discovered when he took his computer to be fixed at PC World in 1997. Choking back tears, he told Southwark Crown Court: ‘I don’t know why. I suppose I just got caught up in some sort of curiosity. 'Because I was probably out of it, I wasn’t empathising with the victims and it’s just the most awful place to be in. ‘It’s got to stop, all this internet pornography of children. It’s got to stop now,’ he said. ‘I was abused as a child and maybe I was trying to work my own feelings out. ‘Today, I have no interest in looking at this awful porn now. It’s disgusting. It’s destroyed my life, it’s destroyed my family’s lives and it’s most likely destroyed all the children’s lives. I’m have nothing but total empathy for those poor children. Scroll down for video . Family man: Glitter in 1975 with son Paul and daughter Sarah. He now says he is not Sarah’s father . Rocker: The former singer, whose real name is Paul Gadd (pictured, left, today and, right, in 1994) was cross-examined at Southwark Crown Court about indecent images of children being found on his computer in 1997 . Glitter, whose real name is Paul Gadd, said his guilty plea to 54 child porn charges in 1999 had destroyed his family. He also said his daughter Sarah did not want to see him after her brother Paul worked out that he could not be her father. The former star went on to say financial woes, his waning career after the death of his songwriting partner Mike Leander and pressure from fans for new material drove him to seek out the depraved images. ‘I was in a very bad place,’ he said. ‘I wasn’t myself at that time and I had a lot of serious decisions to make about my future. I had invested about £200,000 of my own money in a recording career because I couldn’t get a recording company. ‘We were selling out hugely in big concerts, my fans were demanding new material and I had never written with anybody else but Mike Leander.’ Sobbing, Glitter went on to say he had to sell the rights to his songs to Universal Pictures to pay his legal costs and studio bills: ‘By the time I had taken my computer to PC World, I then had other allegations come in so the lawyers’ fees and the lawyers’ bills were tremendous. ‘And I also missed my girlfriend who lived in Cuba. I couldn’t get her out of Cuba.’ He turned to the judge and said: ‘Forgive me my Lord, it’s been devastating for me. ‘I got nicked obviously and I went to prison. I pleaded guilty, I accepted my responsibility for this which I have to this day. ‘I was drinking heavily at this time, I was doing drugs and the other thing, of course, is I had to find this money to pay for the legal costs and studio.’ ‘I’m sorry every day of my life ever since, I’m sorry to my fans.’ However, Mr Price branded him an ‘accomplished liar’ saying: ‘You will accept that people have difficulties in their careers. 'You will accept that they do not reach for their laptop and look for pictures of men having sex with young children.’ Glitter, who appeared in the stand wearing a brown velvet jacket whispered: ‘No they don’t, I was downloading all sorts of porn at that time.’ The former chart-topper who had a string of hits with songs such as I’m the Leader of the Gang (I Am) in 1973, is accused of attempting to rape an eight-year-old girl at the height of his fame. He is also alleged to have sexually assaulted two other girls aged 12 and 13 who went to his concerts. One woman claims that she was 12 when she was plied with champagne. Glitter invited her to his hotel and had sex with her. On the stand: Glitter (pictured giving evidence) said the images were found at a time he was in 'an awful place' Upset: He broke down and sobbed as he insisted he wanted to 'stop all this internet pornography of children' Court case: Glitter denies one count of attempted rape, seven of indecent assault on  young girls, one of administering a drug or other substance and one of sex with a girl aged under 13 at Southwark Crown Court . She told jurors how the singer boasted that Spike Milligan was after him with a gun because the comedian thought he had slept with his wife. Glitter admitted telling tales about Milligan, but denied attacking the girls. He said he had no sexual interest in children, but admitted that he would kiss a girl as young as eight if a young fan demanded it. When asked by Mr Price if he would be interested in raping a young girl, Glitter replied: ‘Absolutely not, why would I do something like that? I have always got girlfriends around me, plenty of women around me, why would I want to do something like that?’ He denies one count of attempted rape, seven of indecent assault, one of administering a drug or other substance with intent to ‘stupefy’ and one of sex with a girl aged under 13. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Glam rocker said son Paul dropped the bombshell over his daughter .

"Match of the Day pundits Danny Murphy and Martin Keown have been hit with tax bills of up to £2.5million after investing in a suspected tax avoidance scheme. A string of celebrities and sports stars each paid a minimum £100,000 to invest in a movie venture that promised to combine box office hits with tempting tax breaks. Former England and Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy, 38, has been told to pay back £2.5million while ex-Arsenal centre back Martin Keown, 48, also faces a seven-figure  bill. HMRC has told them the cash is due by the end of the month. Mr Keown, who writes  for Sportsmail, said today: 'I can confirm I did invest in the film-finance scheme Ingenious, which has recently resulted in me receiving a retrospective tax bill. 'I have always paid my taxes and dealt with this new bill swiftly.' Tax Bills: Former footballers turned Match of the Day pundits Danny Murphy, pictured with Joanna Taylor, and Martin Keown have been told by HMRC they a huge amount  in unpaid tax, it was revealed today . Gary Lineker, Bob Geldof, Anne Robinson, David and Victoria Beckham, as well as Andrew Lloyd Webber are among around 1,000 household names believed to have put cash in to the same scheme. But they are believed to face having to pay the taxman a total of £1billion after HMRC decided they avoided tax. The Ingenious Film Partners 2 LLP scheme had qualified for tax breaks under rules designed by the last Labour government to stimulate the British film industry. Life of Pi (2012) Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2011) X-Men: First Class (2011) The A-Team (2010) Percy Jackson & the Lightning Thief (2010) Avatar (2009) Girl with a Pearl Earring (2003) Hit movies such as Life of Pi, Avatar and Girl With a Pearl Earring all benefited from their investment and tax relief. But HMRC now argues such schemes were not legitimate investment opportunities but a means of avoiding tax - and have asked the stars to repay them. MailOnline understands neither Mr Murphy or Mr Keown have  settled with HMRC yet but are likely to do a deal and pay back at least some of the money tax collectors have demanded. Both are currently unavailable for comment. But source close to Danny Murphy told The Sun: 'He will be on six figures at the Beeb but paying off £2.5million would be a struggle for anyone. The megastars on big wages are able to pay but for others it is proving a huge struggle.' A string of celebrities including David and Victoria Beckham may face having to pay the taxman a total of £1 billion in a dispute over a suspected tax avoidance scheme . Big names: Stars like Gary Lineker and Bob Geldof are also among the 1,000 household names affected . Ingenious used cash invested to help finance some Of Britain's most successful movies under rules devised by the last Labour Government. Murphy and Martin Keown are listed as directors between 2005 and 2011. Other household names who invested in the firm's ventures include the singers Geri Halliwell and Annie Lennox, television presenters Ant and Dec and Davina McCall, and England football manager Roy Hodgson, along with football stars Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard. Those who have spoken about their investment  believe they have done nothing wrong. Last year Lord Lloyd-Webber said he was advised that he was being 'almost philanthropic by investing in the British film industry, and that this was a scheme to promote British films', adding: 'At no time did I consider it solely a tax scheme.' Proud: Ingenious has said HMRC's demands were 'indiscriminate and unfair' and also said their financing of films like Avatar and Life of Pi created £1billion in taxable income for the UK Treasury . Ingenious has said HMRC's demands were 'indiscriminate and unfair'. A company spokesman said: 'The film partnerships run by Ingenious Media have already generated over £1bn in taxable income for the UK Treasury, with more to come over the lifetime of the films they funded. They helped to bring movies including Avatar, the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, the Girl with a Pearl Earring, Vera Drake, Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and Hotel Rwanda to the screen and are clearly run for profit. 'Accelerated payment notices are based on retroactive legislation and are inherently unjust. As regards the Tribunal, the hearing is ongoing and ‎Ingenious remains confident of the outcome'. James Robinson, a spokesman for Ingenious Film Partners LLP, has said that a tax tribunal case against HMRC is  expected to finish in February. A ruling on whether it counts as tax avoidance will follow later this year. These companies helped pay for box office hits all over the world like Life of Pi, Avatar or Rise of the Planet of the Apes (pictured) The Labour government encouraged the setting up of movie production companies as a way of promoting the British film industry. These businesses helped pay for box office hits all over the world like Life of Pi, Avatar or Rise of the Planet of the Apes. But it was also feared they were being exploited for tax avoidance purposes and HMRC has since pursued investors. The terms of the arrangement allowed the investors - believed to have put in at least £100,000 each - to claim tax relief against virtually the total sum ploughed into the film by the partnership - not just the amount that they had personally put in. The partnerships were normally arranged under a two-for-one basis, meaning that if a celebrity put in £100,000 it would be matched by £200,000 from a film's other backers - but the celebrity could claim tax relief on the full £300,000. The rebate had to be paid back over 15 years, but by investing the cash wisely investors could beat the taxman. The films did not have to qualify as British. Experts believe investors could make more money out of the delayed tax payment than they were eligible to pay. But HMRC is now pursuing members and sent them accelerated payment notices - which were brought in last summer and allows the Treasury to claw back money quickly. They believe the investors have gained an 'unfair tax advantage' and owe the treasury an amount 'relating to the tax advantage that the use of the avoidance scheme tries to achieve', HMRC says. The guidance says 'If the person does not pay the full amount shown in the notice by the date specified we may charge you a penalty'. That is initially five per cent of the total balance and  could become at least 20 per cent on top of the bill within a year. Many schemes like Ingenious Film Partners, who have been deemed by HMRC to be producing a tax advantage for members, have asked a court to overturn this decision. But the Treasury reserves the right to hold on to any tax paid back even if they lost because they believe 'if we were successful with our appeal, you would not then pay the amount you owe'.","1,000 invested around  £100,000 in the Ingenious Film Partners scheme .

"Barbara Davis, 61, was arrested on charges of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, violating a restraining order, and mayhem . A Massachusetts woman was arrested during the  blizzard that walloped New England after she attacked her neighbor with a snowblower. Barbara Davis, 61, was arrested on charges of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, violating a restraining order, and mayhem, according to police. She is alleged to have lost her temper and attacked her neighbor at 4:30 p.m. on Tuesday as the snow fell heavily throughout parts of New England. Police were called to a home in Boston's upscale suburb of Arlington to find a 60-year-old woman, who has not been identified, suffering from lacerations to her foot. The neighbors had, allegedly, been embroiled in a long-standing dispute, but the victim was not seriously injured. Arlington Police Chief Fred Ryan said: 'Emotions may run high during a historic weather event like the blizzard we just endured, but that is no excuse for violence.' 'We are supposed to come together as a community during events like this, and I am very disappointed with these allegations.' Anderson was held on $35,000 bail and is expected to be arraigned tomorrow. Suffolk County courts remain closed today after the massive storm that left Boston digging out from more than two feet of snow that fell Monday into Tuesday. However, roads in and around Boston have begun to re-open and public transit was back up and running this morning. The blizzard dumped 26 inches of snow on Boston and 31 inches on South Boston. It was the sixth-largest snowstorm on record in the city's history and the largest ever in January.

"When lawyer Alice Biggar made her new year's resolutions, it wasn't to give up alcohol or go to the gym more. Instead the 26-year-old took on a challenge that would see her living off recycled butcher's bones, foraging for wild berries and eating food destined for the supermarket bin in her hometown of Southampton. Miss Biggar decided to live below the poverty line for a month, and has challenged herself to live on £1 a day throughout January. Scroll down for video . Alice Biggar, a lawyer from Bristol, has launched a challenge to feed herself on just £1 a day and said raiding reduced aisles in supermarkets and surviving on own brand tinned food and foraging for berries is the key . The task has seen her raiding the reduced aisles of supermarkets and even managing to get free recycled bones from a butcher's shop. She said: 'I wanted to challenge myself for the new year, so I made my resolution to be less wasteful with money and live below the poverty line on £1 a day.' While she admits some of her meals have not been the finest in cuisine, Miss Biggar said she has managed to survive 28 days so far by living on tins, including tins of curry, and lots of cheap packaged items such as pasta and supermarket own-brand soups. She even triumphed in her search among the aisles to find an oyster, reduced to just eight pence. Pictured on day one of the challenge Miss Biggar said she was struggling with some of the budget products . But she said the biggest task has been finding fresh vegetables at low prices. She said: 'My best buy was probably a huge bag of parsnips for 4p which I incorporated into a Burns Night supper. I've also visited Skipchen in Bristol - a restaurant which serves only food intercepted from supermarket bins, and I've been foraging for wild berries.' Miss Biggar has charted her progress on her own blog, and said it has become suddenly popular as people appeared to like reading about her struggles to enjoy some of her budget meals. Day 1- Breakfast: cornflakes + office milk . Lunch: warburton thins + pate . Dinner: lasagne (40p) + cucumber (7p) Treat: few slabs of value choc (35p for bar) + live oyster (8p) Day 2 - Breakfast: porridge + water . Lunch: frozen toast from week 1 with 'Brussels pate' + 3 remaining fish fingers . Dinner: fresh egg noodles (10p) + value sweet and sour (30p) + broccoli (10p) Treat: reduced doughnuts x 2 . Day 3 - Breakfast: cornflakes (30p) + value yoghurt . Lunch: burns night – haggis (£1) potatoes (15p) parsnips (4p) swede, leeks carrots (15p) Dinner: leftover sweet n sour noodles . Miss Biggar said own brand soups have helped her feed herself within the tight budget she set . Treat: reduced doughnuts x 1 . Day 4 - Breakfast: porridge + office milk . Lunch: skeleton soup + no bread . Dinner: parsnip (4p reduced) made into roasted chips and chilli (tinned) Treat: apple, chocolate buttons . Day 5 - Breakfast: 30g of coco snaps + milk . Lunch: Vegetable soup and out of date pitta . Dinner: Spag bol (tinned) Treat: Value onion rings . Day 6 - Breakfast: 30g of coco snaps + office milk . Lunch: Tin of questionable chicken soup + 1 pitta . Dinner: spaghetti hoops on toast . Day 7 - Breakfast: 30g of coco snaps + office milk . Lunch: Tin of tomato soup + 1 pitta . Dinner: 250g penne pasta + half carton passata + two onions + four hotdogs + black pepper borrowed from housemate’s cupboard . The blog documents the highs and lows of her progress - including on day 10 when her dog Dexter stole some treasured reduced doughnuts, saved as rare treats to help her cope during the month long challenge. In a post on day 10 she wrote:' It's lunchtime and the curry noodles make an appearance, another student classic. 'At 25p a pack they're a reliable filler and perfectly edible, if a little beige. Utilising vegetarian chicken flavouring it's a tick in the ethics box but a fail on the quest for protein and fresh food.' Miss Biggar said doing her shopping on a weekly basis helped, setting herself a maximum budget of £7 which forced her to shop creatively and not waste any items. 1. Buy supermarket own brands for your staples, for example large bags of pasta. 2. Cook meals in bulk - such as casserole and save portions. 3. Get to supermarkets for prime reducing times, usually between 7pm and 9pm. 4. Don;t be afraid to ask supermarket workers if something is due to come down in price later that day. 5. Try something new - such as foraging or venues like Skipchen, a venue in Brighton that serves food past it sell by date that has been rescued from a sure path to supermarket and restaurant dustbins. 6. Don't stick religiously to best before dates, use your own judgement to test some items rather than automatically throwing them out. 7. Stock up on tinned goods, such as own brand soup. Three weeks into the challenge Miss Biggar said she felt she was getting to grips with how to keep her meals low cost and had learnt some tricks, such as foraging for her own berries and making her breakfast at work so she could take advantage of work milk. She wrote: 'Week 4 and I'm starting to get this budget strategy nailed, a combination of bulk cooking and raiding the whoopsie aisles for fresh food bargains seems like the way to go. 'I recognise that getting to the aisles at the optimum time in order to get my snout in the trough can be a bit of a barrier to fresh produce within the budget. It certainly isn't necessarily always practical for those with families or those who work at those times. The lawyer has also posted recipes for her some of her creative menus - including for 'skeleton soup' which she makes from a base of recycled chicken bones, donated from her local butcher. Miss Biggar is completing the challenge to raise money for the Trussell Trust, which aims to tackle poverty in the UK and Bulgaria. Miss Biggar has lost seven pounds by completing the challenge but insists she has not gone hungry. She says while it has been a good experience, she is looking forward to being able to treat herself again. 'I would recommend everyone tries the challenge for a week - it makes you realise how much we waste on food and it really does make you appreciate what you have,' she added. 'On a personal note though, I'm looking forward to having a wine, take-away and film night.'","Alice Biggar decided to take on a challenge to feed herself for £1 a day .
