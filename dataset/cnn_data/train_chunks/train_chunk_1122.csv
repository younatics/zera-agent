"Martin Murray has arrived in Monte Carlo as he prepares for his world title shot against the fearsome Gennady Golovkin on Saturday. And the St Helens middleweight writes exclusively for Sportsmail as he counts down the days to his third challenge for top honours. I had a great camp in South Africa; it was a great trip and we were really well looked after. As time went on, things got better and better and we left in a good place. It was definitely the right thing to do even though it's been hard being away from the family. The first couple of weeks were difficult with the altitude but towards the end everything was flowing and I was feeling good as my body adapted to it. Martin Murray relaxes in Monte Carlo ahead of his fight with Gennady Golovkin on Saturday . Murray recovers in his hotel room as he prepares to challenge for a world title for the third time . Read the first installment here. Every fighter says they've had a great camp but I'm not one to lie. It's been a good camp, no two ways about it. There have been a couple of things that haven't gone well, as there is with every camp, but we've managed to get over them and make it work. I've never worked at altitude as I did so if the science behind it is right, I'll be the fittest I've ever been. I'm also more experienced than I've ever been, it's my third world title fight, and I'm confident. I know how hard it's going to be but I'm really looking forward to it. We went on safari on the last weekend but that was the only tourist thing we did. Everything else was just training, training, training. I'm not good to be around on fight week. I'm in a hotel room on my own, the rest of the lads are in a different hotel and I don't see them much, I keep myself to myself. I'm getting a bit agitated, the fight's getting closer and I just want to fight. That will change when I weigh in and get some food; I'll be happy again. Murray (third left) with gym-mate Rocky Fielding and the team from Emperor's Palace in Johannesburg . Fielding poses with a lion cub on the team's safari trip on their final weekend before flying to Monte Carlo . Golovkin is in the hotel next to mine but there's no chance I'll see him because I don't go out. I won't see him apart from at the press conference and the weigh-in. I just see the fight as a big job and if I want me and my family to have the lifestyle I want us to have, I have to beat him. Matthew Macklin said the way to beat Golovkin is to take the fight to him but it's easy to say that. It depends what kind of fighter you are. Macklin might be saying that because it's maybe something he wishes he'd done. I'm going to work on the tactics we've come up with. People change when they get hit so I've not just got one game plan, I've got 10, 11, 12... I just want to fight, it doesn't bother me who it is. I was in the lift with my manager and I said I wished he was Golovkin! It might be daunting for some people, but I can't wait.","Martin Murray has been in South Africa for six weeks on training camp .

Kick It Out chairman Lord Ouseley echoed their stance, and said: 'I was shocked that Chelsea fans were still behaving like this. 'I thought the club had made it quite clear and taken action about stopping any repetition, knowing Chelsea, how hard they've worked on these matters, with fans as well as players, that it was unlikely to occur. 'The fact it involved an assault as well, of the individual that they pushed off the train, was even more shocking. Clearly it sends out a strong signal to, not only Chelsea, but the whole of football, that you cannot be complacent and think the actions you're taking are sufficient to deal with the scourge of racism, sexism, homophobia and anti-Semitism.

"A family who said their three-year-old child was thrown out of KFC because her scarred face was 'scaring customers' have denied the story was a hoax - as an investigation has claimed. Victoria Wilcher, who lost an eye in a dog attack, made headlines earlier this month after her family posted a photo entitled 'Does this face look scary to you?' on a Facebook page, Victoria's Victories. The allegations against KFC drew widespread condemnation and prompted the chain to donate $30,000 towards Victoria’s charity, as an independent review was launched into the incident. An unnamed source involved in the investigation told the Laurel Leader-Call that all the evidence in the case suggests the story told by Victoria's grandmother, Kelly Mullins, on May 15 was a hoax. Scroll down for video . Hoax victim? A source involved in the . investigation said all the evidence in the case points towards . the matter being a hoax and that Victoria Wilcher, three, wasn't asked . to leave a KFC in Mississippi . After reviewing surveillance tape from the Woodrow Wilson Drive branch – and another in Jackson - investigators found that the woman and the little girl didn't even visit the restaurant that day. The grandmother had also previously told WAPT that she ‘ordered a sweet tea and mashed potatoes and gravy’ at the restaurant before they were asked to leave. But . a review of transactions on May 15 at both Jackson locations found . those items weren’t included in the same order at any point. And no one . matching the description of Mullins or Victoria visited either . restaurant, the Leader-Call reported. 'It just didn’t happen,' the . source told the newspaper. But despite the findings, the little girl's family has insisted that they are telling the truth. 'I promise its not a hoax,' said a statement the girl's Facebook group, likely written by her aunt, who maintains the page. 'I never thought any of this would blow up the way it has.' No shows: After reviewing surveillance tape from the . branch the investigators have found that the girl and her grandmother, who claimed they had been asked to leave, didn't even visit the restaurant that day . Victoria's grandmother, Kelly Mullins, left, continues to stand by her story, despite an independent inquiry finding no evidence to back up her claims . Denial: In a statement posted on Facebook on Tuesday, the family denied they had made up the story and said the investigation was ongoing . She claimed that the story accusing them of making up the story is 'untrue' and pointed out that the investigation is not complete. 'It is not over until KFC releases a statement,' the statement continued. 'The family has not asked for anything... I have personally watched this family go without to provide for Victoria. They have not and would not do anything to hurt Victoria in any way.' Some of the Facebook users commenting on the statement did not believe the story, however. 'This is the sad reality of the world,' Olivia Normand wrote. 'People use what they can to get what they want. Time to move on.' Victoria had been injured in April when three of her grandfather's pit . bull dogs ran into his home in Simpson County by ripping through the back door of the home before jumping on her. They dragged the little girl outside into the backyard, where they . continued to maul her before her grandfather, Donald Mullins, and his . girlfriend, Rita Tompkins, attempted to stop the carnage. Apology: The family shared the alleged story on Victoria's Facebook page and KFC had quickly apologized . The dogs then . attacked their owners, causing Mullins to shoot them. Two of the dogs . were killed. Victoria was rushed to the emergency room. She suffered a shattered top and . bottom jaw, broken cheekbones and eyesockets, a broken nose, lost her . right eye, and lost the ability to move the right side of her face. Mullins and Tompkins were arrested on charges of child endangerment and their eight surviving pit bulls were seized by Animal . Control officers. Victoria was in the hospital for a month after the attack and upon her return home, she . continued with physical therapy and wore a feeding tube. Before . the story hit the headlines, a gofundme.com site for Victoria had . raised only $600, but since then more than $135,000 has been raised. Attack: Victoria is pictured left before the attack in April. Right, she is pictured the hospital six hours after her grandfather's dogs attacked her - claiming her right eye in the incident and causing facial paralysis . Getting better: She is expected to undergo several more surgeries in the future as she heals from the attack . On . Saturday, Las Vegas plastic surgeon Frank Stile flew out to Jackson . after hearing the story and pledged to donate the costs of covering the . expensive reconstructive procedures, likely in the tens of thousands of . dollars. Dick West, who owns . the local Jackson KFC franchises, posted on Facebook about the incident . on Saturday. 'When . the allegation was first made, KFC pledged $30,000 to go to medical . expenses and started an investigation to find the truth,' he wrote. 'They have pledged the money even if it is proven that the incident . never happened. At this point their story is full of holes. Any thinking . person who follows their timeline can see it. The event at KFC never . happened.' It is unclear if Kelly Mullins will face criminal charges if found to have made up the incident.","Three-year-old Victoria Wilcher was seriously injured when she was mauled by three pit bulls in her grandfather's backyard .

"Carved into the side of mountains, these footpaths offer mesmerising views of a spectacular landscape. Some of the footpaths on Jianmenguan Mountain in Jiange County, southwest China's Sichuan Province, date from nearly 1,000 years ago from China's Three Kingdoms Period. Over the years, these footpaths have been extended and a more modern addition is a protruding skywalk. Tourists can enjoy spectacular views from the Jianmenguan mountain in Jiange County, southwest China's Sichuan Province . A maze of different footpaths traverse the mountain, winding in and out of the cliff faces and offering amazing views of the surroundings . Some of the routes are more 'safe' than others, with ledges to hold on to and steps for comfort, others, as right, are more perilous . The routes are favoured with tourists, and offer the perfect opportunity to snap some photographs of nature at it's most beautiful. And the location is steeped in history. There are 72 peaks in the mountain range, and only one through road. The Battle of Jianmen Pass was fought between the communists and the nationalists during the Chinese Civil War in the post World War II era and resulted in communist victory in 1949. This is one of the more futuristic walkways on Jianmenguan mountain in Jiange County, where visitors get unrivalled views . The paths are favoured with tourists, and offer the perfect opportunity to snap some photographs of nature at it's most beautiful . Whoever controlled this 1.5mile long stretch of the road controlled the gateway of Sichuan, and the nationalists had built an elaborate system of bunkers in the area to strengthen its defense against the expected communist invasion. The communists managed to capture over 300 prisoners-of-wars and had all the remaining people killed in the fierce battle, and more importantly, the taking of Jianmen Pass secured the passage for the communists to invade deeper into the heart of Sichuan. Much history is contained within the mountain, where steps can be traced from the great battle between the communists and nationalists . Wooden railings give some comfort to visitors to the range, but they will still have to be wary of hitting their heads .","The footpaths date from nearly 1,000 years ago from China's Three Kingdoms Period .

"A Connecticut dentist has been charged in the death of a patient who became unresponsive while having 20 teeth pulled and several implants installed last year. Rashmi Patel, 45, of Suffield, turned himself in Tuesday at the Enfield Police Department and was charged with a misdemeanor count of criminally negligent homicide and a felony count of tampering with evidence, police said. Patel has offices in Enfield and Torrington. The charges came exactly one year after Patel's patient, 64-year-old Judith Gan of Ellington, died in hospital on February 17, 2014. Charged: Rashmi Patel, 45, turned himself in to police Tuesday night on a warrant for his arrest, one year after the death of his patient, Judith Gan, 64, who flat-lined in his dentist chair during a marathon operation . Going to trial: Dentist Rashmi Patel, center, sits at a hearing of the Connecticut State Dental Commission in Hartford on Wednesday, December 17, 2014. He has now been charged with criminally negligent homicide . State dental regulators concluded that Patel failed to adequately respond when Gan's oxygen levels dropped dangerously low when she was consciously sedated in the middle of the tooth extraction and implant procedures in Patel's Enfield office the same day. Patel, who posted $25,000 bail, has denied any wrongdoing in his treatment of Gan. He and his attorney didn't return messages Wednesday. Gan's death and other incidents prompted the State Dental Commission in December to suspend Patel's license pending a monthslong review of his practice and permanently ban him from performing conscious sedation. The commission said in a report that Patel 'ignored' signs that Gan was in distress, including the drop in her oxygen saturation, changes in the color of her face and hands, and wheezing and gurgling sounds. Scene: Gan went into distress and later flat-lined during a complex procedure at Dr. Patel's Enfield Dental Surgery in Connecticut. She had a complex history of medical issues that Patel was aware of . The commission said Patel also ignored warnings from his dental assistants that Gan was in danger and continued on with the procedures. The assistants told Patel to stop operating, but he pressed ahead. When one of the assistants yelled that Gan was 'flat lining,' Patel tried to revive Gan while the assistant called 911, according to the Dental Commission's report. Judith Gan, 64, died suddenly on February 17, 2014 . Gan was rushed to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. The commission also found that Patel should not have attempted to perform so many procedures on Gan in one office visit, given that her extensive medical history. Gan had suffered a heart attack six months before the visit, two strokes within the last two years, and the medication she was on could have affected her response to the sedation. Patel was aware of Gan's medical issues. Patel also violated care standards in December 2013, when another patient under conscious sedation to have teeth extracted inhaled a piece of gauze called a throat pack, which was designed to protect him from swallowing foreign objects, the commission found. The patient began flailing, his blood pressure spiked and he was rushed to a hospital but recovered. A lawyer for Gan's husband has said a lawsuit against Patel is planned. Patel was also sued for malpractice in 2009 for 'shoddy' dental work, according to The New York Daily News. The victim, Doreen Jasonis, won $500,000 from a jury before Patel appealed and settled out of court. Banned: Patel’s license, which was issued in 2003, was suspended in April. In December, the board banned him from treating patients under sedation .","Judy Gan, 64, lost consciousness in the dentist chair while undergoing a complex procedure to have 20 teeth extracted on February 17, 2014 .

"A South Florida woman pleaded guilty to two counts of DUI manslaughter in a wrong-way highway crash that killed two 21-year-old friends. Kayla Mendoza, who tweeted '2 drunk 2 care' before the deadly accident, apologized Wednesday to the families of the two victims as she wiped tears from her eyes. 'I know it's long overdue but I just want to tell you all how sorry I am,' she said. She continued: 'It breaks my heart that I've broken your hearts. I'm sorry I caused all this over a stupid mistake.'

'It breaks my heart that I've broken your hearts': Mendoza pleaded guilty Wednesday to accidentally killing Kaitlyn Ferrante and Marisa Catronio . '2 drunk 2 care': Mendoza tweeted this message before she drunkenly plowed into the car carrying Kaitlyn Ferrante and Marisa Catronio . The South Florida Sun Sentinel reports Mendoza will be sentenced April 24. Authorities say Mendoza was 20 years old and driving without a valid driver's license when she ran head-on into a car that carried Kaitlyn Ferrante and Marisa Catronio. Catronio was pronounced dead at the scene around 2am on November 17, 2013. Ferrante was taken to hospital but died from her injuries four days later. The best friends had been heading home to Coral Springs in Miss Ferrante's 2012 Toyota Camry after a night out when they were struck by a Hyundai Sonata driven by Mendoza, police said. Mendoza was heading east in the westbound lanes when she slammed head-on into Catronio's red Camry driven by Ferrante, west of University Drive. The two friends were out celebrating Miss Catronio's 21st birthday. Best friends: Best friends Catronio (right) and Ferrante (left) had been heading home to Coral Springs in Miss Ferrante's 2012 Toyota Camry after a night out when they were struck by a Hyundai Sonata driven by Mendoza . In the aftermath of the tragedy, it was revealed that Mendoza was not shy about her drug and alcohol use on her social media accounts. As well as the '2 drunk 2 care' tweet sent just hours before the crash, she had also referred to herself as the 'Pothead Princess' and fired off dozens of tweets about being high and rolling joints. On the night of the incident Mendoza was found to have a blood-alcohol level of 0.15, she was just 20 at the time and had been out boozing with co-workers from her T-Mobile sales job. After the drinks her manager dropped her off at her car and that is when 'things went black', she said. 'I wish there was something I could say to make up for what happened,' she told Inside Edition last year. 'But no matter how many ''sorrys,'' apologies, tears I cry - no matter how much I hate myself for what happened, nothing I say will change anything.' The crash means Mendoza is currently confined to a wheelchair because she is still recovering from injuries of her own. Gary Catronio, Marisa's father, said that Mendoza had 'changed the lives of our family forever.' 'You took my baby girl,' he said, according to CBS Miami. ' You took my baby girl. You took my wife's best friend. You made bad decision that night. The right decision was to have a friend drive you home.' Tragic: The two friends were out celebrating Miss Catronio's 21st birthday .

"Video shows four American marines urinating on dead bodies in Afghanistan . Though the vast majority of people are outraged over the deplorable behaviour of the four Marines taped urinating on dead bodies in Afghanistan shown in a video circulating the internet, controversial comedian Bill Maher and one CNN contributor have said they support their actions. 'A dead body is just, you know a f***ing body that's dead and it just doesn't bother me,' Mr Maher said on his HBO show Real Time With Bill Maher. 'If they were real Taliban, if they were people who burned down girls' schools, and, you know, do honor rapes and throw acid in people's faces, I'm not that upset about p***ing on them,' he continued. Mr Maher's statements came after those of a conservative CNN contributor who said she would happily join the Marines. Dana Loesch made the comments on her own Missouri radio show and not on CNN. Scroll down for video . For and agasint: CNN contributor Dana Loesch (right) said that she would do the same as the soldiers, while Tim Kudo said that their behavior is unlike that of a Marine and therefore he does not consider the men Marines . She said: 'C'mon people, this is a war. 'Do I have a problem with that as a . citizen of the United States? No, I don't.' She added that she wants 'a million cool points for these guys' and would be willing to join them.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, Captain Tim Kudo, a former Marine and representative of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said that the men cannot consider themselves soldiers because of their offensive actions. ‘I don't see them as Marines,’ he said . ‘I see them as people who have set . back the war effort, put their fellow Marines in danger, and who stand . in contradiction to pretty much everything the Marine Corps stands for . and America stands for. So, it's very hard to look at them and see them . as Marines in that way,’ Mr Kudo said on CBS. ‘Every Marine was absolutely shocked . by what happened. Nobody would have expected something like this, not . just from a unit, but any Marine in general. ‘These actions are completely outside the norm, and basically a few individuals who went rogue,’ he concluded. Grinning: One of the men can be heard saying: 'Have a great day, buddy' as his colleagues laugh and another jokes: 'Golden like a shower' and 'Yeahhhh!' The four Marines in the video have been . identified and are members of the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marines out of Camp . Lejeune in North Carolina. There has been nearly universal condemnation of the soldiers since the video began circulating earlier this week. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, Afghanistan president Hamid Karzai and Senator John McCain are among the biggest names to express their anger. Florida Representative Allen West, an ex-Army lieutenant colonel, insisted the Marines were wrong but fumed: ‘As for everyone else, unless you have been shot at by the Taliban, shut your mouth, war is hell.’ ‘All these over-emotional pundits and armchair quarterbacks need to chill,’ Mr West told the Weekly Standard of their 'self-righteous indignation'. But he said the men must face a ‘maximum punishment’. A spokeswoman for the Marines said: 'While we have not yet verified the origin or authenticity of this video, the actions portrayed are not consistent with our core values and are not indicative of the character of the Marines in our Corps' In addition he suggested they all receive a reprimand letter, issue a public apology to God, the U.S. and their fellow servicemen - and then sing ‘the full US Marine Corps Hymn without a teleprompter’. The Navy's law enforcement arm is heading the main inquiry, which is expected to weigh evidence of violations of the U.S. military legal code as well as the international laws of warfare. Separately, the Marine Corps is doing its own internal investigation. Pentagon officials said the criminal investigation would likely look into whether the Marines violated laws of war. Comments: Florida Rep. Allen West, an ex-Army lieutenant colonel, insisted the Marines were wrong . These include prohibitions against photographing or mishandling bodies and detainees. It also appeared to violate the U.S. Uniform Code of Military Justice, which governs conduct. Thus, some or all of the four Marines could face a military court-martial or other disciplinary action. The psychologist's advice came as U.S. officials spoke out against the footage yesterday and scrambled to maintain damage limitation and avoid another Abu Ghraib scandal. The four were members of the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marines out of Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, reported CNN. An unidentified official said that some of the four are no longer in that battalion. The 40-second clip, which has been described a 'recruitment tool for the Taliban', shows four men in combat gear standing over the three corpses with their genitals exposed as they relieve themselves. There were no further details on their identities. The men can be heard joking 'Have a great day, buddy', 'Golden like a shower' and 'Yeahhhh!' as they groan with relief whilst urinating. It is not clear if the corpses in the video belong to civilians or insurgents engaged in combat, although the film does appear to have been shot in Afghanistan. The anonymous person who posted it included the caption: 'Scout sniper team 4 with 3rd battalion 2nd marines out of camp lejeune peeing on dead talibans.' Camp Lejeune is in North Carolina and is the largest Marine Corps Base on the East Coast of the U.S., home to 40,000 marines. The 3rd Batallion 2nd Marines consists of 800 Marines and sailors and is nicknamed the 'Betio Bastards', a reference to the island of Betio in the Tawara Atoll and the site of one of the most deadly battles with the Japanese in World War II. More recently they have served in Iraq, the Haiti earthquake of 2010 and in Afghanistan. Their motto is: 'We quell the storm, and ride the thunder!' or 'Strength and Honour'. NATOThe NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan described the acts as 'highly reprehensible and disgusting'. ISAF spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Jimmie Cummings said: 'The behaviour depicted in this video is reprehensible and is not in keeping with the values of U.S. Armed Forces.' Hillary Clinton, Secretary of State . She said it was 'absolutely inconsistent with the standards of behaviour that the vast majority of Marines hold themselves to.'MarinesMarines spokeswoman Kendra Hardesty said: 'While we have not yet verified the origin or authenticity of this video, the actions portrayed are not consistent with our core values and are not indicative of the character of the Marines in our Corps. 'This matter will be fully investigated and those responsible will be held accountable for their actions.'PentagonThe government body's spokesman Navy Captain John Kirby said the video was deeply troubling: 'Whoever it is, and whatever the circumstances, which we know is under investigation, it is egregious behaviour.'

He told the commander of western troops in Afghanistan to launch an investigation.Hamid Karzai, President of AfghanistanAfghan president Hamid Karzai said in a statement: 'The government of Afghanistan is deeply disturbed by a video that shows American soldiers desecrating the dead bodies of three Afghans.

"In the 1970s, tourists travelled to western Afghanistan to climb on the ruins of an ancient citadel, a fortress resembling a sandcastle that has stood overlooking the city of Herat for thousands of years. The citadel, which dates back to the days of Alexander the Great, was crumbling then but today it is a newly restored structure and offers a hopeful sign of progress in a country beset by war. Hundreds of Afghan craftsmen worked to restore the ruins' past glory with help from the Aga Khan Trust for Culture and about $2.4 million (£1.5 million) from the U.S. and German governments. Restored: The ancient citadel in Herat as it looks now . Sand castle: The Qala Iktyaruddin Citadel is seen as a bright sign of progress in a country destroyed by war . Crumbling: The citadel had been attacked countless times over the centuries . The U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, Ryan Crocker, was among the tourists drawn to Herat decades ago, and on Sunday he celebrated the citadel's restoration and the opening of a new museum of Afghan artefacts at the site. 'Until 35 years ago, tourists from around the world came here to experience heritage, history and incomparable national landscapes,' Crocker said. 'We look forward to the day when Afghans and visitors from around the world will once again come here to learn about Afghanistan's rich history and enjoy the great hospitality and beauty that this land and its people have to offer.' Tourism seems far-fetched in Afghanistan, where tens of thousands of foreign troops are in their tenth year of fighting Taliban insurgents. Yet, the rebuilt, imposing brick structure called the Qala Ikhtyaruddin is a new symbol of the nation's desire to emerge from the bloody conflict. Croker continued: 'As this citadel represents, Afghanistan stood as a great nation. It will so stand again.' Revamp: Inside, the citadel has been completely renovated . War-torn: Afghans carry a casualty after a blast near a foreign base in Herat - where the Citadel has been rebuilt - in May . A Taliban soldier armed with a rocket propelled grenade launcher watches over refugees in Maslakh camp near Herat in 2001 . Taliban attacks have recently occurred inside Herat. They are rare, though there are districts on the city's outskirts where violence flares. While there was mention of the recent attacks, several officials at the ceremony were warning of another threat: Uncontrolled development that is endangering other historical sites in the city along the famous Silk Road that linked Europe and Asia in ancient times. Ajmal Maiwandi, chief executive officer of the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, said: 'As we sit within the high walls of this impressive monument celebrating the fruits of our joint effort to save this site, I would like to remind all those present here that the rate at which historic quarters and buildings in this city are being destroyed far surpasses the four dozen buildings that we've restored over the past seven years.' The Ministry of Information and Culture is now the caretaker of the citadel, which has survived years of territorial battles among Persians, Uzbeks and Afghans and today's Taliban. The current structure was built on the site of an ancient citadel that some historians claim was established by Macedonian warrior-king Alexander the Great around 330 B.C. On the hills on the outskirts of Herat, an Afghan military officer, right, prepares the fighters a decade ago . Afghan refugees carry sacks of wheat provided by the United States government, who have helped find the nearby Citadel's rebuilding . The battlements and towers that still stand are believed to date from the 14th or 15th century when it was reconstructed after being destroyed by Mongol invaders. Some of the blue tile work from that period can still be seen on some towers. UNESCO did extensive renovation at the site in the 1970s. The Culture Ministry took over stewardship at the site in 2005 and has worked since 2008 with the Aga Khan Trust for Culture and the U.S. and German governments to restore the structure and set up a museum at the site. U.S. support for the citadel restoration came from the U.S. Ambassador's Fund for Cultural Preservation and is the fund's largest project in the world. Mohammad Rafiq, a mason from Herat who worked on the project, said he took pride in the work because he sees it as part of the country's broader reconstruction. 'It was not only about making money. It was good work to do,' he said. 'This is the biggest monument in the region. We tried our best to do the reconstruction so that it recopied the old styles of the building.' Housed at the citadel is the National Museum of Herat, one of four provincial museums in Afghanistan to reopen to the public. The Museum of Islamic Art in Berlin worked with the German Archaeological Institute to document and restore artifacts and prepare them for display. There are about 1,100 items from the Herat region in the museum; about 250 are on display. Most of them are from the 10th to 13th centuries when Herat was a center of politics and culture. There is pottery, metal work, a tombstone of major Persian painter Behzad, 260 manuscripts and books and a cenotaph adorned with tiles that date from 1378. Nancy Dupree, an American who has worked in Afghanistan for decades to protect and preserve the country's culture and heritage, stood outside the museum and glanced up at the citadel's sun-baked towers. 'I've been here many times, but it was crumbling,' she said. 'This is impressive. 'I think the most exciting thing is to see something finally accomplished. I have seen so many half-finished things.'","'As this citadel represents, Afghanistan stood as a great nation. It will so stand again'"
"After displays to please the eye this season, Middlesbrough displayed their determined side to rescue a draw with 10 men and ascent to the summit of the Championship. Patrick Bamford scored with 17 minutes left to edge Aitor Karanka's side a point ahead of Bournemouth and Derby County. A day after Birmingham's parent company brought in receivers to control affairs, it looked like the team would produce a positive response, courtesy of a Paul Caddis penalty that also saw Boro goalkeeper Dimitrios Konstantopoulos sent off. Midfielder Paul Caddis converts a penalty to give Birmingham City a 1-0 lead at St Andrew's . Birmingham City forward Demari Gray (left) tussles for the ball with Middlesbrough defender Ben Gibson . But, perhaps hesistant after six games without a win, they failed to press their numerical advantage and the visitors finished the contest the better team. Bamford struck his 12th goal of the season with a finish through the legs of Darren Randolph, following a one-two with Grant Leadbitter to unlock Birmingham's defence. 'The mighty Boro, we're going up,' the travelling fans chanted. Who can blame their optimism after nine league matches without defeat. Gary Rowett's team had gone ahead thanks to a terribly underhit backpass from Ben Gibson in the 42nd minute. Clayton Donaldson seized onto the ball ahead of Konstantopoulos, touching it into space, only to be brought down by the diving Boro goalkeeper.

Referee David Coote was some distance away but pointed to the spot without hesitation, producing he red card soon after. The incident bore echoes of Wayne Rooney's penalty against Preston but Konstantopoulos remaining on the ground injured illustrated contact had been made here. There may have been an element of gamesmanship as the 36-year-old Greek took his time to walk from the field with Tomas Mejias coming on, but it proved fruitless. Three minutes after the initial award Caddis dispatched from 12 yards with zero fuss. Tensions on the touchline had been bubbling away, with Rowett and Karanka exchanging words and jabbed fingers at one stage, but little argument was made over this key decision. It had been an even contest to that point, Birmingham shading the attacking moments thanks to the deadball delivery of David Cotterill and the pace of Demarai Gray. Andrew Shinnie struck a fine shot from range that required a good save, while Jonathan Spector was denied by a desperate block from Gibson.

"Andy Carroll has revealed the shocking state of his knee after major surgery on the injury that will keep him sidelined for the rest of the season. The 26-year-old West Ham striker suffered torn ligaments in his left knee during West Ham's 0-0 draw with Southampton last week and had surgery on Tuesday. After previously posting a picture of his swollen and bandaged leg, Carroll took to Instagram again as he shared images of his wounds. Andy Carroll reveals his wounds after having surgery on torn knee ligaments . The West Ham striker shared the images on his Instagram account after going under the knife on Tuesday . Carroll injured his knee but stayed on the pitch after West Ham had made all three of their substitutes . The 26-year-old England international will miss the rest of the season following surgery on the injured knee . Carroll has posted a picture of his bandaged and swollen knee on his official Instagram account . September 2012 - Picks up hamstring injury in his first game on loan - out for a month . November 2012 -Twists knee against Manchester United - sidelined for two months . May 2013 - Damages heel in the last game of the season - out for seven months . July 2014 - Tears ankle ligaments in pre-season - sidelined for four months . February 2015 - Tears knee ligaments against Southampton - out for the season . The pictures reveal a large scar down the side of Carroll's knee with two further incisions close to the kneecap and just above it. Carroll at least appeared in good spirits following the surgery, posting the caption: 'That's knee modelling out the window!! Great job by Mr Andy Williams.' Fears over Carroll's injury grew after pictures emerged of the striker leaving St Mary's on crutches following the Southampton stalemate. Speaking last week manager Sam Allardyce had hoped that Carroll would only be out for between four and six weeks but a specialist later confirmed the England international required surgery. West Ham striker  Carroll was pictured leaving St Mary's on crutches after Southampton draw . The injury is a major blow to Carroll, who has started just 24 games in the last 18 months because of three different injuries. Carroll made his first appearance of the season in November because of ankle problems that required surgery in pre-season. Hopes were high after Carroll scored five goals in 11 league starts. But the former England striker then injured his left knee against Liverpool on January 31 and it was on his return from that injury that Carroll, appearing as a substitute against Southampton last Wednesday, suffered his latest problem to the same knee. With West Ham having used their substitutes and down to 10 men, Carroll stayed on the pitch to help grind out the 0-0 draw. With hindsight, that decision appears to have backfired on a player who cost West Ham £15m in June 2013.","Andy Carroll tore his knee ligaments against Southampton last week .

"It was revealed on Tuesday night’s special EasEnders episode that Lucy Beale had been killed in her own home. And on the latest instalment of the BBC One soap, the ongoing murder mystery unravelled even further when a distraught Peter Beale (Ben Hardy) was finally told the truth by his girlfriend Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa), who pointed the finger at his own parents. In a dramatic cliffhanger showdown, the troubled youngster rushed home to confront his father Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and stepmother Jane (Laurie Brett) after they tied the knot in front of all their family and friends, accusing one  of them of murdering his twin sister. Scroll down for video . Distraught: Peter Beale was finally told the truth about his twin sister's murder by girlfriend Lauren Branning . After an emotional confrontation with Lauren, who has pieced together the clues in detective Emma Summerhayes' case file, the semi-live episode ended with Peter bursting into the family home and declaring, ‘Lauren’s told me - Lucy was killed in this house… and it was one of you!’ This was only the second bombshell of the evening, since it was also revealed that Lauren is expecting  Peter’s child. She had fled Albert Square to avoid a confrontation, but her father Max Branning found her waiting in an abortion clinic after uncovering the truth about the pregnancy by checking her phone. Suspicious: Jane had been wracked with nerves since reading Lauren's note and was extremely flustered while saying her wedding vows to Ian . Surprise! It was revealed that Lauren is expecting Peter's child, with her father Max turning up at an abortion clinic to talk her into keeping the baby . He proceeded to talk her out of making a rash decision, all the while probing whether she would be going to the police about Lucy's killer since he still believes that his youngest daughter Abi is the culprit. ‘I’m not doing it because I don’t love it. I’m doing this because I already do. It’s for the best’, Lauren cryptically declared. And when Abi spilled the beans to Peter, he missed his own father's wedding to find Lauren at the clinic and tell her he wants to keep the baby. Shocker: Max Branning confronted his daughter Lauren at an abortion clinic . ‘I always wanted kids. Loads of them and I want them with you’, he pleaded. ‘I know we’d be young parents, but we’d be really good at it. I’d do everything for you… both of you.’ But it seems Lauren has already made up her mind and wants nothing to do with the Beale family, deciding to tell Peter the terrible truth about who killed his twin sister all those months ago. Jane and Ian – who have both been prime suspects in the never-ending murder mystery – certainly raised suspicions throughout the episode as they were both visibly dealing with guilt. As they exchanged vows, Lauren’s note (which featured prominently in Tuesday’s programme) preyed heavily on Jane’s mind. Visibly flustered, she paused the ceremony to ask where Peter was and stopped to get a glass of water. Anxious: Jane struggled to go through with the ceremony and is  hiding something from her family . Recovering enough to continue with the wedding, she made a speedy exit during the pub after-party and seemed to be preparing for the worst when Ian came to find her at home, shortly followed by Peter. As suspected, the Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) storyline from the first of this week’s special 30th anniversary episodes was a red herring. The soap kicked off with the outraged blonde querying why her father Max thought she had killed Lucy. ‘You were pretty angry with her. You might have pushed her, she might have banged her head or something’, he explained. Abi retorted: ‘I told you we had a row, and I slapped her!’ Not guilty: The Abi Branning bombshell turned out to be a red herring, although she did confess  she wished she had killed Lucy, who was having an affair with her father . Dubious Max was still convinced his youngest daughter is the culprit and tried to cover it up from her mother Tanya Branning, who  returned to Albert Square especially for Ian and Jane’s nuptials. Actress Jo Joyner made a welcome return to the soap after almost two years away and had her moment of glory when she confronted Abi about her alleged crime. ‘I didn’t, but I wish I had [killed Lucy]’, Abi declared. However, Jo unfortunately fluffed one of her live lines earlier on in the episode, mentioning Ian Beale by the actor's real name, Adam [Woodyatt]. She asked, 'How's Adam?', leading to a confused look from her scene partner Laurie Brett [Jane]. Short-lived comeback: Jo Joyner has returned to the soap for two episodes as Tanya Branning . Elsewhere, soap veteran Dot Cotton (June Brown) confessed to a murder of her own. She went to the hospital to apologise to bed-ridden Ronnie (Samantha Womack) – who has just woken up from her coma – for her son Nasty Nick Cotton (John Altman) putting her there. But as she was pouring her heart out about leaving drug addict to die, her grandson Charlie (Declan Bennett) entered the room and was stunned to discover the truth about his father’s last days. ‘I’ve killed my son’, the god-faring pensioner admitted. EastEnders continues on Thursday night, when viewers will finally discover who killed Lucy, and concludes with a fully-live episode on Friday.

"Nine- year-old Jack Bristow is thought to be one of the youngest men in the world to be diagnosed with testicular cancer . A boy of nine has been diagnosed with testicular cancer – making him what is believed to be the youngest sufferer in the world. Jack Bristow has had to have his right testicle removed and has undergone two rounds of chemotherapy, causing his hair to fall out. The diagnosis came after the youngster’s right testicle began to swell in September last year when he took a blow to his groin while playing football at school. Doctors said it was likely to be inflammation and he was prescribed ibuprofen to decrease the swelling. Just weeks later he took another knock to his groin when playing at school and was taken to Basingstoke and North Hampshire Hospital. It was probably this blow that saved his life. Doctors found his right testicle was significantly larger than his left. His parents were told he could have a torsion of the testicle – in which a cord becomes twisted and cuts off its blood supply – or it may be dead and could need to be removed. After doctors concluded it was neither of those, a biopsy was taken and it showed there were abnormal cells. Jack was then transferred to Southampton General Hospital where doctors found he had seminoma, a testicular cancer germ cell tumour. Medics told the family that Jack was probably the youngest in the UK, and the world, to be diagnosed with the disease. In the weeks since the diagnosis in December, Jack has had his right testicle removed and had two cycles of chemotherapy. He has also had testicular tubing removed and has had biopsies, ultrasounds and countless blood tests. Jack, pictured with his parents Joanne and Dan, was diagnosed in December after visiting doctors complaining of a swollen right testicle. He has since had his testicle removed and has faced two rounds of chemotherapy, causing his hair to fall out. His father, in a show of solidarity, has shaved his head . Jack and his family are raising money for the hospital ward where he was treated. Doctors told his parents the cancer is 'treatable', giving them hope . His mother, Joanne, 29, of Basingstoke in Hampshire, said: ‘I can’t even begin to describe how we felt. I thought I had felt heartache before but that nearly killed me. Jack is taking it all a whole lot better than we thought he would – it’s probably affected us more than him.’ Father Dan, 32, added: ‘The doctors think he is the youngest to have it but said it is one of the most treatable types of cancer so it fills you with hope. 'It is thanks to those kicks that we found out he had cancer. If that had not happened we would never have known – it helped save his life.’ Cancer of the testicles most commonly affects men aged 15 to 45, with around 2,200 cases diagnosed each year. Around 47 per cent of men diagnosed with the disease will be under 35 years old. Despite it being a relatively rare form of cancer, it is one of the more treatable. If caught at an early stage, men can expect a high cure rate with 98 per cent of sufferers disease-free a year after treatment. If caught at any stage, 96 per cent of men will still be alive 10 years after their treatment. Unlike many cancers, there are few known risk factors for testicular cancer. Men born with an undescended testicle, are at a slightly greater risk. Around 10 per cent of sufferers will have a history of this condition. Having a brother or father affected by testicular cancer can also increase a man's risk. Some research has suggested the disease is slightly more common in men with fertility problems and men with HIV are more likely to develop testicular cancer. Signs and symptoms include: . Source: Orchid, Fighting Male Cancer . His parents have been told that the treatment has a 95 per cent success rate. Jack said: ‘It doesn’t really feel like I have cancer. 'Sometimes it’s really painful but sometimes it’s okay. I’m not a fan of needles though. My friends have all been really supportive.’ Dr Alan Worsley, of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘Only a handful of children are diagnosed each year in the UK with testicular cancer. The good news is that, thanks to research into better treatments, most patients diagnosed with testicular cancer survive.’ The family, which also includes his seven-year-old brother Alfie, are now fundraising for the Piam Brown Children’s ward at Southampton General Hospital, where Jack goes for treatment.","Jack Bristow went to see doctors with a swollen testicle in September .

"Obesity and diabetes could be prevented by switching off a receptor in the brain which causes overeating and food cravings. Researchers have blocked the effects of the nuclear receptor PPARgamma in a small number of brain cells in mice, causing them to eat less and become resistant to a high fat diet. It is hoped that the same results may one day be possible in humans to prevent weight gain. Obesity could be prevented by switching off a receptor in the brain, which causes overeating and food cravings, scientists say . Trendy diets are leaving millions of Britons with stomach aches and other digestive problems, according to new research. Just under half of all adults suffer some pain when they try and lose weight and 55 per cent of people aged 25-34 – who are most likely to try ‘faddy’ diets - are in discomfort. A report by Potter's Cleansing Herbs Tea said that the age group was most likely to try regimes such as Atkins and Cabbage Soup. In a survey of 2,000 adults, it found that half are on a diet. Those suffering stomach ache are likely to give up their quest to lose weight and pile on the pounds. Health expert Dr Chris Etheridge said: ""It is so important to be aware our digestive health can affect our weight, with so many of us apparently unable to maintain our weight at a healthy level.’ ‘Keeping our digestive health in tip-top condition is vital for weight management as well as our overall health.’ The study, by Yale School of Medicine in Connecticut, aimed to prevent obesity associated with a high-fat and high sugar diet. The mice ‘ate fat and sugar, and did not gain weight, while their control littermates did,’ said Sabrina Diano, professor in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynaecology and Reproductive Sciences at the university. ‘We showed that the PPARgamma receptor in . neurons that produce POMC could control responses to a high-fat diet . without resulting in obesity.' POMC neurons are found in the hypothalamus and regulate food intake. They are the neurons that when activated make us feel full and curb appetite. PPARgamma regulates the activation of these neurons. Professor Diano and her team genetically engineered mice to delete the PPARgamma receptor from POMC neurons in order to see if they could stop obesity, despite the creatures eating a sugary and fatty diet. ‘When we blocked PPARgamma in these . hypothalamic cells, we found an increased level of free radical . formation in POMC neurons, and they were more active,’ she said. While the findings could potentially . solve the widespread obesity crisis, they could also have implications . for people with diabetes. PPAR gamma is a target of a class of drug . called thiazolidinedione (TZD) – used to treat type 2 diabetes – which . lowers glucose levels - but at the cost of some patients gaining weight. The findings could have implications for people with diabetes.The scientists think that people treated with the thiazolidinedione drugs such as Pioglitazone (illustrated) gain weight as a side effect, but that future medication could solve this problem . ‘Our study suggests that the increased weight gain in diabetic patients treated with TZD could be due to the effect of this drug in the brain,' 'Professor Diano said. 'Therefore, targeting peripheral PPARgamma to treat type 2 diabetes should be done by developing TZD compounds that can’t penetrate the brain.' She believes it may also be possible to keep the benefits of TZD without the side-effects of weight gain. ‘Our next steps in this research are to test this theory in diabetes mouse models,’ she said. The study was published in The Journal of Clinical Investigation.","Researchers from Yale School of Medicine have blocked the effects of the nuclear receptor PPARgamma in a small number of brain cells in mice .
This caused the animals to become resistant to a high fat diet .

"Private health companies are pocketing a record £18 million each day from the NHS budget as more and more health contracts are passed over to the private sector. New figures from the Department of Health show that last year £6.6 billion was taken from the NHS coffers to pay private health providers - a 50 per cent rise from before the coalition took power. Critics of the coalition Government's health reforms say this trend of allowing private companies to cream off NHS cash is set to increase. Campaigners are also concerned that independent providers could be putting patients at risk as they strive to safeguard profits, which is cash sucked out of the NHS system. But the Department of Health said charities, social enterprises and other providers have played a vital role in delivering free healthcare to patients for years. The statistics, from the Department of Health in answer to a written question, show that in the year before the ConDem coalition took power £4.1 billion was spent with private providers. Private health companies are pocketing a record £18 million a day from the NHS budget as more health contracts are passed to the private sector. New figures show last year £6.6 billion was taken from the NHS coffers to pay private health providers (file image) This has now risen steadily through their term of office from £4.8 billion in their first year of office to last year's figure of £6.6 billion. It means that around £1 in every £20 of the NHS's total £113 billion budget ends up in the hands of private health care providers. In January, shadow health secretary Andy Burnham claimed the NHS would be sunk by a toxic mix of cuts and privatisation under the Tories, while Labour leader Ed Miliband said the service would be gone within five years under Conservative management. Speaking on the issue last month Mr Burnham said: 'I believe we [Labour] let the market in too far and it's my view that if you carry on with this experimentation with the market in the National Health Service, you will in the end destroy everything that is precious about it.' Last year it emerged that private providers were being paid to do one in five NHS knee ops, one in six hip operations and one in 10 cataract surgeries. In one case a batch of outsourced cataract operations in Somerset left dozens of patients in severe pain from botched surgery. Andy Burnham MP, Labour's Shadow Health Secretary, said: 'These figures blow apart Jeremy Hunt's claim that NHS privatisation isn't happening' The contract was brought to a halt after NHS medics saw a complication rate from the surgery of 10 times the expected amount. A total of 37 of the 62 cataract patients seen by Vanguard Healthcare Solutions needed follow-up care. Two patients suffered burns, six lost pigment in their irises and four were left with microscopic shards of metal in their eyes after being operated on at the private facility. Andy Burnham MP, Labour's Shadow Health Secretary, said: 'These figures blow apart Jeremy Hunt's claim that ""NHS privatisation isn't happening"". 'It is happening and it is happening on his watch. 'This is because contracts are being forced out onto the open market by David Cameron's Health Act. Labour believes in protecting the public NHS and will repeal the rules that are fragmenting and privatising it. 'The NHS of the future demands more integration. The problem with this Government's policy is that it's taking it in the opposite direction, towards more fragmentation. 'These figures show what is at stake at the coming election. David Cameron's Government is stealthily hiving off NHS services without the permission of the public.' A Department of Health spokesperson said: 'Official NHS accounts show that use of the private sector amounts to only six pence in every pound the NHS spends. 'Charities, social enterprises and other providers of healthcare play an important role in the NHS, as they have done for many years.' Answering the written question, requesting the figures, health minister Daniel Poulter, added: 'Independent providers, both for-profit and not-for-profit, have long through successive governments been providing care to National Health Service patients. 'Under this Government competition between providers of NHS services has been pursued on the basis of competition for quality through a system of fixed national tariffs. 'Our position on who should provide services is taken to ensure patients receive the best possible services and outcomes. 'These decisions are taken by the local clinicians, who are best placed to act for the benefit of their patients.'","Figures from Department of Health show in 2013-14 £6.6 billion was taken from NHS coffers to pay private health providers .

"Worried: David Cameron has held crisis talks at Downing Street after being told of allegations of a sensational love affair which has potentially significant political implications for him . David Cameron has held crisis talks at Downing Street after being told of allegations of a sensational love affair which has potentially significant political implications for him. For legal reasons, The Mail on Sunday cannot disclose the identities of the people involved or any details of the relationship – even its duration – other than that they are middle-aged figures. The affair has now concluded. But this newspaper can report that when aides told Mr Cameron the identities of the alleged lovers he was ‘stunned’, and, according to sources, ‘immediately realised the importance of the story’. The Prime Minister and his aides also discussed the possible fallout should details of the affair become public – and how such disclosure could ‘blow out of the water’ any major political set pieces planned by No 10. One senior source told this newspaper last night: ‘This revelation is dynamite. None of us could believe it when we first heard it. Then we just thought, “What a complete mess”.’ The source added that, apart from the political implications, the revelation had caused ‘great personal distress to innocent parties’. It is understood that the Prime Minister was told of the relationship - which does not involve anyone serving in the Cabinet - within the past few weeks. If details of the affair do emerge, it could place a further strain on Mr Cameron’s leadership, which is already being tested by backbench revolts over issues such as Europe and gay marriage and rumours of plots being hatched to overthrow him. On Friday, he faced a further blow when one of his MPs, Patrick Mercer, resigned the party whip after being caught in a cash-for-questions ‘sting’ operation. If the affair is revealed, it is likely to cause as much public surprise as the disclosure of the relationship between John Major and Edwina Currie, which was kept secret for nearly two decades until 2002. Like Mr Major, Mr Cameron is increasingly finding his time in Downing Street is beset by sex scandals. Surprised: When aides told Mr Cameron the identities of the alleged lovers he was said to be 'stunned'. He is pictured with his wife Samantha during their holiday in Ibiza last week . Just weeks ago, the Commons was rocked by the news that Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans, a Tory MP, had been arrested following allegations that he raped one man and sexually assaulted another between 2009 and 2013 – accusations he has branded ‘completely false’. A third person has also given a statement to Lancashire police, claiming to have been sexually assaulted by Mr Evans, and on Friday police said they were planning to interview a fourth alleged victim who claims he was intimately groped by Mr Evans in a Commons bar. In April, Scotland Yard said it had launched a formal investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct by the Liberal Democrat peer Lord Rennard. The Metropolitan Police set up a . phoneline for alleged victims after a number of women made claims about . inappropriate conduct by the peer, who was the party’s former chief . election strategist. Pressure: Mr Cameron is finding his time in Downing Street is beset by scandals. Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans, left, was recently arrested following allegations that he raped one man and sexually assaulted another . Patrick Mercer, right, was caught in a cash-for-questions ‘sting’ operation . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who had initially denied knowing about the allegations, was later forced to concede that his office had heard ‘indirect and non-specific concerns’ as far back as 2008. And, in a further case, Liberal Democrat MP Mike Hancock will tomorrow face a disciplinary hearing to determine whether he should lose the party whip over ‘very serious allegations’ of sexual assault. Mr Clegg asked the party’s chief whip to convene the meeting after Hancock was served papers as part of a High Court civil action brought by a ‘vulnerable’ constituent.

"An Oregon couple involved in online pornography has been arrested on charges of murder by abuse after an autopsy determined their 7-week-old baby boy died of starvation. Douglas County sheriff's deputies said Wednesday that 26-year-old Stephen Michael Williams Jr. and 21-year-old Amanda Marie Hancock were arrested Tuesday at their home in Glendale. A probable-cause affidavit filed by deputies says the parents told investigators they did pornography, which involved the mother self-lactating while others paid to watch online. The two also said they fed the baby milk but never took him to a doctor, despite signs he was losing weight. Meet the parents: Stephen Williams Jr., 26, of Glendale, Ore., and Amanda Hancock. Williams and Hancock were arrested Tuesday at their home on charges of murder by abuse after their seven-week-old baby boy, Data Hancock, was determined to have died of starvation . 'Stephen and Amanda both admitted there was no prenatal care, and they didn't go to any doctor's appointments,' the affidavit read. According to Williams, he never called a doctor because it was Hancock's responsibility. An ambulance was originally called on January 22 to treat an infant in distress, though efforts to revive the child were unsuccessful. An autopsy performed on the child revealed that he had died of starvation. According to the affidavit, the couple showed indifference to the infant dying. “The charging document says the couple showed extreme indifference to human life in causing Data Toria Hancock’s death by failing to provide him adequate food and medical care.” Williams and Hancock also have a 2-year-old son together. The child has been placed in child protective services for the time being. The couple openly admitted that they didn’t go to any doctor appointments, and didn’t participate in any sort of prenatal care before their baby was born. After being arrested at their Glendale home, the couple was charged with murder by abuse. The couple's 2-year-old son was taken into protective custody. A grand jury will hear the charges next week.","Stephen Michael Williams Jr. and Amanda Marie Hancock were involved in lactation porn .

"The Airbnb phenomenon has reached fever pitch with many travellers opting out of staying in conventional hotels. But the reality of staying in someone's home - or indeed sharing your own home with relative strangers - can be whirlwind of social expectations and potential for awkwardness. Which is why long-standing etiquette experts, Debrett's, have formulated a guide to navigating the minefield of modern manners, whether you're hosting or staying in someone else's home. Airbnb guests are advised to be punctual, remove muddy shoes and avoid prying into their hosts' affairs . Sixty-eight per cent of the British public think that social etiquette is on the decline according to research by Airbnb, as part of their collaboration with Debrett's. The guide hopes to rectify this by combining guidance rooted in centuries of British etiquette, such as rules on punctuality and how to make the perfect introduction, with advice on modern predicaments like smartphones and social media at the dinner table. Guests are advised to be punctual, remove muddy shoes before entering their accommodation, and avoid poking their noses where they're not wanted. Lingering baths and making a mess of the bathroom are frowned upon, as is smoking real - or e-cigarettes in no-smoking zones, and the excessive use of mobile phones. 'Giving, and enjoying, hospitality is an occasion on which everyone should be on their best behaviour, and it is imperative that both hosts and guests put their gadgets away, look up and focus on the other people in the room,' it states. 'Talking while glancing at a screen looks adolescent and ill-mannered.' Social skills experst, Debrett's, have formulated a guide to hosting or staying in someone else's home . 1. Turn off your phone . 2. Avoid Instagramming your dinner . 3. Don't get drunk . 4. Take off dirty shoes at the door . 5. Try not to snoop! 1. Put the kettle on . 2. Clean all the sheets and towels . 3. Stock up on toilet roll . 4. Introduce them to everyone, including pets . 5. Open the door with a smile . Airbnb's research revealed that playing with a mobile phone was the most sociably unacceptable thing to do in someone else' home - according to 65 per cent of those asked. Getting drunk and announcing special dietary requirements at the last minute were also looked down upon. Meanwhile, hosts are expected to create a welcoming environment. Rooms should contain freshly made-up beds, guest towels, storage space and some welcoming touches, for example a vase of flowers, some bedside reading or guest soap. 'It is deeply discouraging for guests to find themselves accommodated in, for example, a children's bedroom, forced to squeeze into a small divan, negotiate their way past piles of cuddly toys and gaze up at mobiles and luminous stars,' the guide says. Stocked up loo roll and plenty of clean towels are advised if hosts want to stay in favour with their guests . And don't forget to offer guests a hot drink. Not being offered a cup of tea was found to be 'shocking' by Airbnb's research team. When it comes to pets and children, while you might adore yours, others might find a yapping dog or yelling toddler a trifle irritating at 5am. 'Look carefully at the behaviour of your children and dogs and try objectively to understand the effect they have on other people. Then do your utmost to ensure that any negative impact is minimised,' advise Debrett's. Joanne Milner, CEO at Debrett's, comments: 'Etiquette is as relevant now as it's ever been. Shared economy businesses like Airbnb are very clever because by and large everyone wins – guests get more authentic travel experiences while the hosts can make money and strike up new friendships. It is, however, a relatively new phenomenon, and with that comes confusion regarding manners and behaviours. 'The results of the Airbnb survey are interesting, and dovetail with our advice that manners are there to make everyone feel welcome, remove any anxiety, and minimise social difficulties or awkwardness. 'It's not difficult to be a great guest or host – you just need to make sure you're fully engaged with the other person, give them your full attention, be courteous and be respectful.'

"This is not a drill. The first real polar vortex of the season is expected to hit the East Coast in full force Thursday and Friday, bringing a blast of arctic air capable of setting all-time February temperature lows from the deep South to Virginia. The polar vortex is a usually rare phenomenon whereby air circling the North Pole is pushed down into North America. Last year, the East Coast experienced just two instances of polar vortex, but they were such scarring experiences that the term was floated around for any bout of cold weather the entire season. But this time it's back for real. A polar vortex system has been moving down from the North Pole all week and has already arrived in parts of the Midwest. It's back: Just when you thought it couldn't get any colder: A polar vortex system will blow in from the North Pole on Thursday to bring record low temperatures to much of the eastern United States . Long winter: The northeastern U.S. - especially Boston, Massachusetts  - have been struggling to keep up with a constant barrage of snow. Niagara Falls in Upstate New York is pictured partially frozen over on Tuesday . By Thursday morning, the system will move further south into Appalachia and the western Mid-Atlantic. Kentucky is expected to receive the brunt of the frigid weather, with temperatures likely to dip 40 degree below normal. Meanwhile, Washington DC hasn't experienced below zero temperatures for February 19 since 1994, and the vortex is expected to break that lull as well. Temperatures in the capital have been hovering in the teens lately, leading the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal to freeze over. But the vortex is saving the worst of it's punch for Friday, when sub-zero temperatures will wipe the region from Ohio to West Virginia and up into the Mid-Atlantic. District of Cold: The polar vortex is expected to break records in Washington, DC on both Thursday and Friday. Above, visitors to the capital's Lincoln Memorial walk through snow on Tuesday . Eye of the cold: The arctic blast is expected to start Thursday and hit the states of Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio and Virginia the hardest . No TGIF: The worst of the polar vortex will be reserved for Friday, when most of the Midwest is expected to shiver in sub-zero temperatures . Michigan, Indiana, southern Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia and far western Virginia are forecasting morning lows of minus 20 degrees. Meanwhile the Weather Channel predicts that Cincinnati, Ohio; Knoxville, Tennessee; Roanoake, Virginia and Charleston, West Virginia will also break temperature records for that day. The low temperature record for DC for February 20 was set all the way back in 1896, with 8-degrees but that should be easily quashed. Adding to the pain will be windy conditions, with wind chill warnings issued across most of the Eastern U.S. Rutgers University climatologist Dave Robinson described the vortex as 'essentially the coolest air found in the Northern Hemisphere'. 'It's situated up in the Arctic in the bulk of the winter. But occasionally, a lobe of that will dip south above the jet stream and allow that cold air down into the Middle Atlantic states,' Robinson explained to CBS News. East Coast dwellers will remember their old nemesis well. Last year, the polar vortex caused wide-spread drops in temperature, several feet of snow, and the associated chaos of power outages, cancelled flights, and school closures.

"The number of women being screened for breast cancer has fallen for a third year running, reigniting the long-standing debate over the benefits and risks of mammograms. By the end of March last year, 4.28 million of the 5.64 million eligible women aged 53 to 70 in England (75.9 per cent) had been screened within the three previous years. That compares with 76.4 per cent at the same point in 2013, 77 per cent in 2012 and 77.2 per cent in 2011. Of those screened, 17,961 aged 45 or older were diagnosed with cancer - a rate of 8.6 cases of the disease per 1,000 women, up a rate of 8.3 cases the previous year. And 40 per cent (7,175) of women had invasive but small tumours, measuring less than 15mm in diameter, which are often too small to detect by hand. The number of women being screened for breast cancer in England in 2014 fell for a third consecutive year, with 4.28 million of the 5.64 million eligible women aged 53 to 70 (75.9 per cent) having a mammogram . While screening has fallen again this year,  the number remains above the NHS Cancer Screening Programme's minimum standard of 70 per cent. But the figures have, once again, reignited the debate over the benefits versus the risks of women having regular mammograms. It comes as a new study, published in The Lancet, reveals women who understand the risk of over-diagnosis during mammogram screening are less likely to take part in programmes. Lead researcher Professor Kirsten McCaffery, from the University of Sydney, said: 'Mammography screening can reduce breast cancer deaths but most women are unaware that inconsequential disease can also be detected by screening, leading to over-diagnosis and over-treatment.' In recent years, a mounting body of evidence has suggested breast cancer screening does more harm than good. Scientists have concluded that women risk false positives, where abnormal results turn out to be normal. And experts fear women are being subjected to over-treatment, which has included needless breast removal and surgery on harmless cancers that would never have caused symptoms or death during a patient's lifespan. But leading charities today implored women to continue to have regular mammograms, adding they remain the best way of detecting the disease. Furthermore, the Department of Health's Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer published in 2011, recognised cancer screening as an important way to detect cancer early, adding around a third of breast cancers are diagnosed through mammograms. It comes as a new Australian study found women who understand the risk of over-diagnosis during mammogram screening, have lower intentions to take part in screening programmes . In the UK, the NHS invites all women between the ages of 50 and 70 for regular mammograms, every three years. In the US, the Preventative Services Task Force recommends women aged 50 to 74 are screened every two years. Today's figures, published by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, show the number of women opting for screening fell across all age groups within the 53 to 70 range. Of particular note is a fall among the three younger age groups. Coverage reached the target of 70 per cent in all but one of the nine regions in the UK. In London, just 68.9 per cent of eligible women had been screened within three years, while in the East Midlands - the region with the highest coverage - 80.3 per cent of women were screened. Breast screening is a method of detecting breast cancer at a very early stage. The first step involves an X-ray of each breast - a mammogram - which is taken while carefully compressing the breast. Most women find it a bit uncomfortable and a few find it painful. The mammogram can detect small changes in breast tissue which may indicate cancers which are too small to be felt either by the woman herself or by a doctor. In recent years a mounting body of evidence has suggested breast cancer screening does more harm than good. Scientists have concluded women risk false positives, where abnormal results turn out to be normal. And experts fear women are being subjected to over-treatment, which has included needless breast removal and surgery on harmless cancers that would never have caused symptoms or death during a patient's lifespan. But leading charities today implored women to continue to have regular mammograms, adding they remain the best way of detecting the disease. Detection rates were lowest for women aged 45 to 49 and 55 to 59 (6.5 case per 1,000 women screened), while they were highest among women aged over 70 (15.6 cases per 1,000 women screened). Dr Emma Pennery, clinical director at the charity Breast Cancer Care, said while at first glance the declining figures may appear 'worrying', it is not that 'straightforward'. She told MailOnline screening has both 'benefits and limitations'. 'It's estimated for every life saved, three women will have unnecessary, often difficult treatment,' she said. 'However, screening remains an effective way of detecting breast cancer at an early stage and this can help to increase the likelihood of successful treatment. 'One of the reasons why the number of women going for screening is declining could be on-going confusion around the benefits and risks of screening. 'Understandably, this can make women reluctant or anxious about attending. 'Breast Cancer Care wants all women to have access to clear information about screening so they can make an informed choice about whether to attend.' Meanwhile Dr Christopher Runchel, research officer at Breakthrough Breast Cancer, admitted it is 'disappointing' to see a 'slight decline' in the proportion of women screened. But he added it is 'good news' that the figure is still above the NHS standard of 70 per cent. He told MailOnline: 'Early detection offers the best chance of successful treatment which is why Breakthrough Breast Cancer encourages women to attend screening when invited. 'However, there are some risks associated with breast screening and so it's very important that each woman makes an informed choice as to whether they wish to attend. 'Breakthrough has developed an innovative online guide which gives women the full facts about breast screening and will help them make the decision that is right for them.' Lester Barr, chairman of the charity Genesis Breast Cancer Prevention, said it is 'disheartening' to see 'sceptical voices about breast screening have led to the year-on-year decrease in the NHS screening programme'. He told MailOnline: 'The screening process is crucial to identify breast cancer in its earliest stages. The new figures published by the Health and Social Care Information Centre found of those 4.28 million women screened in 2014, 17,961 aged 45 or older, were diagnosed with breast cancer, pictured under the microscope - a rate of 8.6 cases of the disease per 1,000 women, up a rate of 8.3 cases the previous year . 'During the primary onset of the disease, many women are unable to detect changes by self-examination alone. 'The decreased stats prove that more needs to be done to encourage women between the ages of 47 and 74 to attend their regular breast screening appointments.' He said it is 'imperative' that the issue is addressed and plans are put into action to combat the decrease. The new Australian study, published yesterday, is the first research to examine the effect of including information about the possible harm caused by over-diagnosis and over-treatment, in packs given to women before they choose whether to take part in screening programmes. The first symptom of breast cancer most women notice is a lump or an area of thickened tissue in their breast. Most breast lumps (90 per cent) aren't cancerous, but it's always best to have them checked by a doctor. Breast pain isn't usually a symptom of breast cancer. Source: NHS Choices . Professor McCaffery said the findings 'underlines the ethical imperative for women to have clear decision support materials so that they can make more informed decisions about whether they want to have a breast screening mammogram.' 'A health system centred around the individual should assist decision-making that incorporates a woman's values and preferences, irrespective of whether her eventual choice is to screen or not. 'Therefore, momentum is shifting from uninformative and persuasive approaches to screening communication to clear and balanced information, giving people the opportunity to make informed choices based on their assessment of the trade-offs between potential outcomes.' The women, taking part, had not had a mammogram in the past two years, and did not have a personal, or strong family history of the disease. The scientists findings revealed those women who received detailed explanations about the possible harms linked to screening, had 'significantly less favourable attitudes towards breast cancer screening, although attitudes remained positive overall. And notably, fewer women said they intended to be screened for breast cancer. The information given to women was in the form of a booklet and showed outcomes of breast screening over 20 years, compared with no screening, including breast cancer mortality reduction, over-detection and false positive diagnoses. A control group of women received the same information bar the detail relating to over-detection.","New figures show 4.28 million of 5.64 million eligible women aged 53 to 70 in England (75.9%) had been screened for breast cancer in 2014 .

"You may think that women do most of their shopping just after pay-day – but it seems it’s another time of the month that sends them to the tills. A study of more than 500 women suggests that ladies like to buy more things when they are at their most fertile. Researchers found that their test subjects, aged between 18 and 40, sought a wider variety of items when ovulating – an impulse that extended to their love-life. A study of more than 500 women suggests that ladies like to buy more things when they are at their most fertile (file picture) Professor Kristina Durante, of Texas University, explained: ‘Just like a fisherman casting a wide net, ovulating women seek to cast a wide net into the dating pool and expand the number of potential suitors they have to choose from. ‘This desire for variety in men at ovulation triggers a variety-seeking mindset that carries over into desire for variety in products.’ Her study, published in the Journal of Consumer Research, suggests a link between choices in women’s personal relationships and the marketplace for the first time. Previous research had already shown ovulation can shift dating habits. Now her four experiments, including participants who were not pregnant or taking hormonal contraceptives, have found that women’s desire for more men also made them want to do more shopping. Professor Durante said: ‘For about a week every month normally cycling women – constituting more than a billion consumers – may be especially likely to respond to appeals by competing brands to switch.’ Researchers found that their test subjects, aged between 18 and 40, sought a wider variety of items when ovulating . However, she added that when researchers asked women to imagine themselves ‘in a loving relationship with a desirable partner’ – or when married subjects were asked to put on their wedding rings – they no longer wanted to buy lots of different products when ovulating. The study's findings have practical implications for marketers. A company might appeal to mate attraction motives in marketing messages to spur increased desire for variety and novelty in consumer choice. Prof Durante added: 'For about a week every month normally cycling women - constituting more than a billion consumers - may be especially likely to respond to appeals by competing brands to switch.' Future research is needed to examine whether the social value, cost or rewarding nature of the product influences the effect of fertility on variety seeking.","Study by Texas University looked at more than 500 women aged 18 to 40 .

"New procedure: A study found that gently scratching the lining of the womb before IVF greatly increased the odds of pregnancy (picture posed by model) A simple scratch could double a woman’s chances of having an IVF baby, doctors believe. A study found that gently scratching the lining of the womb before IVF greatly increased the odds of pregnancy, cutting the financial and emotional cost of repeated treatment. IVF costs between £3,000 and £15,000 a course, but just one in four of the 50,000 women who have it each year have a baby. The technique, called endometrial scratching, involves using an instrument similar to a coffee-stirrer to make four scratches on the lining of the womb. It costs around £300 and only takes a few minutes. Doctors believe a fledgling embryo may find it easier to nestle in the furrows. It is also possible that the scratches release hormones that make the womb stickier and so the embryo finds it easier to implant. Sir Robert Edwards – the IVF pioneer behind the birth of Louise Brown, the world’s first test-tube baby – was a firm believer in the technique. The practice fell out of favour as fertility treatment became more technical but some doctors feel it is time to bring it back. Clinics around the world are researching it, and Britain’s first proper trial of the technique has just finished. Scroll down for video . During the IVF process, eggs are removed from the ovaries and fertilised with sperm in the laboratory . The latest study, at Ankara University in Turkey, involved 114 women aged under 40 who had tried IVF without success at least twice. Some 38 per cent of those given endometrial scratching with IVF became pregnant, compared with 20 per cent of those given IVF alone, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine’s conference in Honolulu heard. A cheap form of IVF using baking soda is to be tested in Britain next month. It costs a third of the price of standard treatment as it does not involve expensive drugs and equipment. In conventional IVF, the embryo is grown with a mixture of nutrients in a large incubator with expensive carbon dioxide pumped through. But scientists from Colorado University in the US found the same effect using citric acid and sodium bicarbonate – baking soda. This enables the embryo to be grown in a smaller incubator, the size of a shoe box. The technique, called simplified culture system (SCS), resulted in the birth of 18 healthy babies in Belgium, with an overall success rate of about 34 per cent. In the trial next month, 50 British women under 37 will pay £1,000 to undergo the procedure – as opposed to at least £3,000 for standard IVF. Dr Geeta Nargund of the Walking Egg Foundation, which is overseeing the trial, said funding for IVF in the UK is ‘very limited’ and that SCS could ‘end the current postcode lottery because more cycles could be offered within the existing NHS budget constraints’. Charles Kingsland, of the Hewitt Fertility Centre at Liverpool Women’s Hospital, said data on the technique is ‘quite encouraging’, but clear evidence of its benefits are needed before all fertility doctors are advised to use it. Professor Kingsland said: ‘It’s a very technically easy thing for a suitably trained gynaecologist to do. ‘It’s not the most pleasant thing … We advocate that the woman has a paracetamol before she comes in. ‘After a cup of tea, the vast majority of women will be able to drive home.’ The consultant gynaecologist, who was mentored by Sir Robert, said: ‘When we were putting embryos back … he said, “Make a little scratch when you put them in”. And we thought, “That’s not right, you should be putting them in very, very delicately and carefully”, and it’s turned full circle now.’ He added that the procedure ‘would be brilliant if it did work’. Nick Raine-Fenning, of Nottingham University’s Nurture fertility unit, said studies have had mixed results. But, on balance, successes outweigh the failures. ‘It is possible that only a certain sub-group of patients may see an increase in pregnancy and birth rates and that the benefit is restricted to those with previous unsuccessful attempts at IVF,’ he said. Dr Raine-Fenning added that there is some scepticism about the practice because ‘we remain uncertain of the underlying mechanism’.","Innovative technique, called endometrial scratching, costs around £300 .
Study found those who tried it almost doubled their chance of pregnancy .
Procedure could save women who repeatedly try IVF thousands of pounds .

"Everyone knows to hold off going to the bathroom for as long as possible after a few drinks because once that seal is broken the urge to take a trip to the toilet then regularly interrupts your evening. However, no one seems to question why our bladders fills up so quickly - particularly when consuming booze is so dehydrating. Dr Karl Kruszelnicki has decided to explain the science behind why 'breaking the seal' is inevitable when you get stuck into a few tipples - and he also dispels the myth that balancing loads of water with alcohol will make you less dehydrated. Breaking the seal: The brain produces anti-diuretic hormone, ADH, to stop you from urinating - however when drinking alcohol your brain doesn't make as much ADH as is ideally needed . Dr Karl Kruszelnicki explains why we need the toilet more often when we drink alcohol . Dr Karl says there is no 'magical' seal that holds the urine at bay inside the bladder other than the 'normal urinary sphincter'. In fact, it is the alcohol that interferes with the amount of hydration required for the body to produce as the the brain and kidneys work together on a 'minute-by-minute basis' to keep the bodily fluids flowing. The brain produces anti-diuretic hormone, ADH, to stop you from urinating - however when drinking alcohol your brain doesn't make as much ADH as is ideally needed. He said the body holds up well until the third drink. It's at about this point when the kidneys kick in to start making a lot of urine - hence the endless toilet stops as the elbow continues to bend throughout the hours. Dr Karl was then quick to point out that dehydration should not be taken lightly. 'Dehydration is quite serious — you can die of it,' he warns in his regular ABC science column. He then compares the bladder to a dried-out sponge that you drip water onto until it eventually becomes drenched. 'Add just one more drop of water on top of the sponge and now a single drop of water will form on the bottom of the sponge and begin to form a continuous trickle,' he said. This is when the kidneys kick in to start making a lot of urine - hence the endless toilet stops as the elbow continues to bend throughout the hours . And as logic has it - volume is also a factor as a social outing often involves consuming more alcohol than water. 'Of course, by the time you get up to a litre of beer you're getting a little bit dehydrated and your kidneys will cut back a little,' he said. 'But overall the volume of urine you generate is still greater than the volume of water contained in the beer, so you get slightly dehydrated.' Dr Karl is the first to admit it's 'weird' that although your body is dehydrated - it produces more fluid when consuming alcohol than if you were drinking water. 'But, because you are voluntarily taking a powerful drug called alcohol, your protective systems get out of whack,' he explains. And he quashes the theory that if you have lots of water in combination with alcohol you won't be as dehydrated because the body will only absorb about 30 - 50 per cent of the excess water. 'The rest just goes down the toilet bowl. You end up better off than not having drunk the extra water, but you'll still be dehydrated.' Dr Karl's final words of wisdom about consuming copious amounts of booze? 'You don't buy beer, you only rent it.' Drinking lots of water in combination with alcohol won't help you be less dehydrated because the body will only absorb about 30 - 50 per cent of the excess water .","When drinking alcohol your bladder holds up well until the third drink .
Brain produces anti-diuretic hormone, ADH, to stop you from urinating .
But when drinking alcohol your brain doesn't make much ADH .
So this is when the kidneys kick in to start making a lot of urine .

"Rwanda has accused the BBC of 'genocide denial' and called for the corporation to be banned from the country after it aired a controversial documentary that questioned official accounts of the horrors of 1994. 'Rwanda's Untold Story', broadcast this month, highlighted growing criticism of President Paul Kagame and alleged that his Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) — then a rebel group, now the ruling political party — was behind the shooting down of a presidential plane that triggered the genocide. The Hutu community has always been held responsible for the mass slaughter of Tutsi population in 1994, when up to a million people were murdered in 100 days - a rate of slaughter that was faster than the Holocaust in the Second World War. But the BBC's programme included interviews with two American researchers who suggest that thousands of Hutus could have been killed too, possibly by RPF forces. It claimed a UN report expressing similar concerns had allegedly been suppressed. Scroll down for video . Genocide: The Hutu community has always been held responsible for the mass slaughter of Tutsi population in 1994, when up to a million people were murdered in 100 days - a rate of slaughter that was faster than the Holocaust in the Second World War . Disputed: Official accounts hold that the Hutu-led government allowed and sanctioned its militias to conduct these atrocities, wiping out 20 per cent of the country's entire population in the process . Militia: Official accounts hold that the Hutu-led government allowed and sanctioned its militias to conduct these atrocities, wiping out 20 per cent of the country's entire population in the process. But the BBC documentary suggested many more Hutus may have been killed by Tutsi militia (pictured) Belgian historian Prof Filip Reyntjens even tells the programme that Kagame could be one of the 'most important war criminals still in office today'. Now furious lawmakers in parliament have now called for the FM licence the BBC uses to broadcast across the country — in English, Kinyarwanda and French — to be pulled and the programme's producer and presenter be charged with genocide denial, a punishable crime in Rwanda. 'We must stand and fight against these deniers,' Senate President Bernard Makuza said, according to the New Times newspaper. 'Among the decisions we should consider is taking a legal action against the deniers, be it internally or externally,' 'We should as well consider revising the agreements Rwanda has with BBC. This is an open struggle that cannot be taken lightly and should be taken on by everyone collectively.' 'Genocide denial'? Earlier this month, president Paul Kagame (pictured with British prime minister David Cameron in 2007)  told parliament that the BBC had chosen to 'tarnish Rwandans, dehumanise them' and accused it of 'genocide denial' Horror: Ethnic Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front troops look over a pile of skulls dug up to be reburied in a memorial for approximately 12,000 Tutsi massacred by Hutu militia in and around the western town of Kaduha . MP Julienne Uwacu said Rwandans should 'switch it off completely', the New Times added. Earlier this month, Kagame told parliament  that the BBC had chosen to 'tarnish Rwandans, dehumanise them' and accused it of 'genocide denial'. Marie Bamutese was one of hundreds of thousands of Hutu refugees brutalized and chased across Rwanda and into the Congo by forces that the BBC claimed were allied to President Paul Kagame. She told the programme how she witnessed the repeated bombing of Hutu refugee camps allegedly by Kagame's artillery and the remains of Hutu refugees piled up like a moutai. She told how she saw her own grandmother die of physical exhaustion before her own seven-year-old cousin, Elodie, died on her back as she carried her though the forests to escape the massacres. Perhaps most shockingly, she even described how her mother was forced to cut a deal with a local family, allowing Marie to be raped in exchange for safe passage out of the country. She told the programme: 'I can not explain what it is like to see children die like flies. One day I sat next to two dead children. I felt nothing. I felt dead with them in the forest.' Later she adds: '[The Tutsi militia] killed all the refugees ... it was necessary to kill the greatest number of Hutu refugees ... and they were killed because they were  so many. ' Prominent international academics, experts and diplomats have echoed his comments, accusing the BBC of being 'recklessly irresponsible' by allegedly promoting a revisionist account of the genocide in the documentary. 'We urge the BBC to apologize for the offence this program has caused for all victims and survivors of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda,' they said in a statement. The documentary producers are accused of attempting to acquit the Hutu militia and reduce the number of Tutsi victims. According to the experts, the film-producers tried to decrease the number of Tutsi killed from 1 million to 200,000 and raise the number of Hutu victims. 'They even claim that in 1994 more Hutu than Tutsi were murdered – an absurd suggestion and contrary to all the widely available research reported by Amnesty International, UNICEF, the UN Human Rights Commission, Oxfam, Human Rights Watch, Africa Rights, a UN Security Council mandated Commission of Experts and evidence submitted to the ICTR and other European courts who have successfully put on trial several perpetrators,' the experts claimed. Kagame was himself asked about the programme during an appearance at the thinktank Chatham House in London this week. 'For me as a Rwandan and the leader of Rwanda, I just wish we could concentrate on development of our country and being the best for our people,' he said. 'The BBC can say whatever they want to say. They don't have to say or do, whatever they do or say, because that is right. They say or do whatever they say and do because they can.' The documentary suggested that President Paul Kagame ordered the downing of the plane of former President Juvenal Habyarimana, the act that is believed to have sparked the genocide. But Rwandan Minister of Foreign Affairs Louise Mushikiwabo branded the documentary  an 'attack on Rwanda and its people' and said that her government is contemplating taking action against the BBC. Carnage: A Rwandan worker lays the remains of humans in Kigali in 2000.   Authorities said at least 200,000 human remains were found in pit latrines, construction sites and behind churches. Most of these Tutsi victims were either shot or hacked to death . 'My government reserves the right to respond, on its own timing, in a manner commensurate with the weight of the offense,' she told The Associated Press. April 6 1994: President Juvenal Habyarimana dies when his plane is shot down en route home from peace talks with Tutsi RPF rebels . April 7: It is not clear who is behind the shooting but it sparks the systematic mass killing of mainly Tutsis by extremist Hutu militia and military elements . April-July: An estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus are slaughtered . RPF denies accusations they killed thousands of Hutus as they march through the country . July: RPF captures the capital, Kigali . July: Two million Hutus flee to Zaire, now DR Congo . The BBC, one of the country's most popular broadcasters, said the programme in 'no way' sought 'to downplay or conceal the horrifying events of 1994' and subsequent events and denied that any part of the programme constitutes a 'denial of the genocide against the Tutsi'. It said: 'There are repeated references to the mass killings of Tutsis by Hutus in 1994 and that this constituted genocide. The programme also includes an interview with the director of the Genocide Museum at Murambi, a Tutsi and genocide survivor, and a convicted Hutu genocidaire who spoke of his part in the killing of thousands of Tutsis. 'The BBC has a duty to investigate difficult and challenging subjects and we believe the programme is a valuable contribution to the understanding of the tragic history of the country and the region, and of the governance of Rwanda over the last 20 years.' The corporation also said there had been several attempts to ask the Rwandan government to respond to the allegations but in vain. Students also marched through Kigali on Wednesday demonstrating against the BBC. In 2009, Rwanda temporarily banned the BBC's Kinyarwanda broadcasts over comments also concerning the genocide. David Mepham of Human Rights Watch wrote this week: 'These admirers – and others – seem to be willfully ignoring the darker side of Kagame's record in office. Rwanda under Kagame has no tolerance for dissent or political opposition … Scores of Rwandan journalists have fled the country, unable to report freely and fearful for their safety.'","1994 genocide saw 800,000, mostly minority Tutsis, killed in just 100 days .

"A 30-year-old cyclist has died after being crushed to death by tipper truck during rush hour in central London, Scotland Yard said. The  truck had been driving along a one-way street close to Victoria tube station in south west London at 8am this morning when it struck the woman on the inside lane at a set of traffic lights. The woman  was found unresponsive at the scene on Victoria Street, which has been covered by a makeshift tent by officers, and she was pronounced dead on arrival. A 30-year-old female cyclist was killed after she was hit by a tipper truck in south west London this morning . Witnesses described seeing the bicycle being crushed under the second set of wheels of the Gordon Plant Hire truck as it attempted to turn left at the junction. Another cyclist is said to have jumped in front of the lorry to stop it moving further, but the woman had already suffered fatal injuries. Carnel Jarca, a 42-year-old Big Issue seller, was stood opposite the crash when it happened. He said he saw the driver - a man he believes to be in his fifties - get out the truck wearing a hi vis jacket and looking 'devastated'. He said: 'I heard this horrible metal on metal sound and then I saw this other cyclist come in front of the lorry and wave at the driver. Witnesses described seeing the cyclist trapped under the second set of wheels of Gordon Plant Hire truck . She was pronounced dead on arrival and police have put up a make shift tent as investigations continue . 'He had already stopped, but he stopped it moving any more. He had been sat at the red light and he had only just moved off. The corner is just too tight for a bike and a lorry together. 'The driver came out of the lorry and asked the cyclist what had happened. He looked under the lorry and just put his head in his hands. This morning's fatal accident on Victoria Street is the fourth involving a cyclist in 2015. Stephanie Turner, 29, was killed in an accident with a lorry in Stamford Hill, north London on January 20. Almost a fortnight later, on February 2, music producer and sound engineer Akis Kollaros, 34, died in a collision with a lorry in Homerton, east London. Four days after his death, 26-year-old fashion designer Federica Baldassa was killed in London's Bloomsbury square following an accident with a lorry. The spate of deaths so far this year is already above the average number nationally - a normal January would see 9.8 cyclist deaths across the country. The total London cyclist death figure for 2013 was 14. 'He looked totally devastated and astonished. He was in complete shock, I think he was horrified. 'He just went and sat at the side of the road with his head in his hands. There was nothing anyone could do. 'The other cyclist went to help as well but it was too late, she was under the wheels I think. The police, ambulance and fire brigade all turned up very quickly and started shutting off the road.' Des Dacosta, a maintenance engineer who approached the junction shortly after the accident, said: 'I could see the bike all mangled under the wheels. 'I didn't want to look at the cyclist because I could tell it was a really serious accident. 'I work around here a lot and it's a very busy junction, all day and all night, it is relentless. It's just tragic, another cyclist killed in London.' Metropolitan Police said the driver was stopped at the scene but no arrests have been made. Next of kin are in the process of being informed and a post-mortem will be scheduled in due course, they said. The incident is being investigated by the Serious Collision Investigation Unit and officers are now appealing for witnesses. Roadworks at the site have been in place since May 2011 as Victoria station undergoes extensive improvement works, with the project due for completion in 2018. The crash is the fourth fatal incident to involve a cyclist in London so far this year and highlights the danger for those hoping to get around the capital on a bike. On January 20, 29-year-old Stephanie Turner, a physiotherapist, was killed in an accident with a lorry in Stamford Hill in north London. Then on February 2, music producer and sound engineer Akis Kollaros, 34, died after a collision with a lorry in Homerton in east London. The crash is the fourth fatal incident to involve a cyclist in London so far this year as figures are said to be above average . Four days later, 26-year-old fashion designer Federica Baldassa was killed after an accident with a lorry in London's Bloomsbury Square. AA president Edmund King said: 'Sadly, this tragic death bears all the hallmarks of the 'typical' London cycle death - a female cyclist killed by a tipper truck turning left. 'These cases continue despite the AA's Think Bikes Campaign, the Metropolitan Police 'changing places' initiative and other Transport for London and Department for London campaigns. 'We have distributed more than six million Think Bikes stickers to drivers to put on their side mirrors to remind them to think bikes but obviously much more needs to be done to stop this carnage.' The spate of deaths is already above the national average - a normal January would see an average of 9.8 cyclist deaths nationally. Cycle safety in London came to the fore in the autumn of 2013 when there were six cyclist deaths in the capital in just two weeks. But the total London cyclist death figure for 2013 was 14. Carnel Jarca, a Big Issue seller, who was stood opposite the crash when it happened, said: 'I just heard this big sound, a crash, the sound of crushed metal' Overall in 2013 nationally, there were 109 cyclist deaths, including six children, 3,143 serious injuries to cyclists and 16,186 slight injuries, making a total of 19,438 casualties, including 1,958 children. Figures from Transport for London last month showed that cycling in the capital is now at record levels, having grown by 10 per cent in the last year. Bicycles now make up 16 per cent of traffic in central London and 25 per cent at peak times on key routes.","Truck was driving along a one-way street near Victoria underground station .

"PC David Woods is currently under investigation as part of a professional standards review over his business, Military Mart, which sells Nazi mugs . A police officer is under investigation over his lucrative sideline – selling guns, machetes and Nazi memorabilia. PC David Woods is a director of the firm Military Mart, which sells lethal weaponry from an army surplus warehouse. It boasts a wide variety of weapons, including replicas of AK-47s and Uzi sub-machines guns – all capable of firing air rifle ammunition – as well as bayonets and axes, mugs bearing the Nazi swastika and SS skull and a gas chamber sign, described as being ‘ideal for kids’ bedrooms’. While it is not illegal to sell knives, machetes or air-powered imitation firearms to those over 18, police chiefs have mounted an investigation in the officer’s activities. PC Woods, 34, has declared Military Mart, which claims it is one of the best stocked stores of its kind, as a business interest to his bosses at Merseyside Police. But they are now examining whether Woods’ business meets policing standards as some officers complain his activities are an ‘embarrassment’ to the force. A senior source said: ‘Machetes, long-bladed knives and replica guns are all regularly used in committing crime, so he could effectively be arming the criminal fraternity. ‘Selling Nazi memorabilia is completely abhorrent in a serving police officer. This is a major embarrassment to the force and senior officers will want to put an end to it.’ Woods was based within the force’s Matrix unit – the specialist unit set up to tackle gun and knife crime on Merseyside – before being moved out after ‘serious concerns’ over his integrity arose. Since 2011, he has continued to be employed under a Service Confidence Plan - which means he is monitored under a scheme to ‘restore confidence’ in officers whose integrity is called into question when serious concerns arise but criminal or misconduct proceedings are not possible. He carries out front-line police duties in Knowsley, in Merseyside, including executing drug warrants and tackling organised gangs. Companies House lists Mr Woods, his brother Paul Woods and his 18-year-old nephew Andrew Woods as co-directors of Military Mart, which operates from a warehouse in Ormskirk, Lancashire. Merseyside Police says it will now investigate whether ‘a serving police officer has registered a business interest that may not be appropriate’. A force spokesman said: ‘All declared registered business interests are considered on a case-by-case basis by management and either approved or declined. Military Mart is selling a 'Nazi Eagle Mug' for £3.99 which is describes is 'popular among rifle enthusiasts' 'This matter has now been referred to the force’s Professional Standards Department and this particular business interest is to be reviewed.’ Cllr Simon Shaw, of Merseyside’s Police and Crime Panel, said: ‘Although I understand that this business interest was declared, was the nature of some of the items reportedly on sale made clear? ‘Maintaining full public confidence in the police is obviously vital, and that is why outside business interests have to be declared and sometimes can be a problem.’ PC Woods and Military Mart refused to comment. The online store is also selling a t-shirt with slogan 'Uzi does it' and a Nazi skull mug stating 'Since 1933' The shop stocks 20 different kind of air rifles, including this replica Uzi. Some of the guns retail for £175 . A set of three throwing knives are available from the shop co-directed by PC David Woods, who formerly worked for Merseyside Police's anti-gun crime Matrix unit . An axe like this one is one of the many weapons on sale.

"Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond today warned European leaders to urgently  stump up extra money to fight the Ebola crisis - as figures revealed the founders of Facebook and Microsoft alone had given almost as much as France. Mr Hammond, in Luxembourg for a crisis summit on the epidemic sweeping West Africa, said world leaders had ‘a short window’ to beat the disease. European Union governments are working to raise £800 million in aid by the end of the week to fight the deadly virus - with Britain and the US having so far picked up the bulk of the costs of fighting the outbreak. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond arrived at today's European Union foreign affairs council summit in Luxembough to hammer out a rescue package to combat the Ebola outbreak . Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg had contributed £15million - more money  than India – while Microsoft founder Bill Gates had stumped £30million, which is more than half as much as the French government. EU foreign ministers are holding a week of talks today to agree better measures to fight Ebola. Mr Hammond said: ‘We've got a very short window to get on top of it and prevent the uncontrollable spread of the disease,’ British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said. ‘We do need this billion-euro fund.’ So far, the overall anti-Ebola total for the EU, including EU national contributions, stands now at nearly £395 million, with Britain contributing £125 million and Germany some £80 million. The Netherlands also promised to send a frigate to West Africa to help, matching a similar contribution from Britain. ‘Money is very important, equipment is very important, staff is very important,’ said EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton. The EU's incoming Foreign affairs head Federica Mogherini and Mr Hammond spoke before the start of the summit today . The World Health Organization's representative to the EU, Roberto Bertollini, was relieved to hear EU promises of action. ‘It's time to act now ... if we want to limit the amount of cases to an amount that is controllable,’ he said. In Spain, officials said nursing assistant Teresa Romero now appears to have beaten Ebola but she won't be considered virus-free until she is tested Tuesday for a second time. She was among those treating a Spanish missionary who died of Ebola on Sept. 25. ‘The first good news is that the evolution of Teresa Romero is positive,’ said Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo. ‘The second is that the 15 others (linked to her) did not present any symptoms.’ Bystanders look at a health worker in protective clothing after he and his colleagues removed the body of a woman suspected of having died after contracting the Ebola virus in Bomi county, on the outskirts of Monrovia, Liberia . Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said Ebola has killed more than 2,000 people in her country and has brought it to 'a standstill' It comes after David Cameron warned last week that Ebola was 'the biggest health problem facing our world in a generation'. The Prime Minister warned other countries to 'look to their responsibilities' to help tackle the epidemic ravaging parts of West Africa amid growing anger at the lack of international support in the fight against the deadly virus. Mr Cameron said Britain was 'leading the way' in providing assistance to the region and called for other countries to match the UK effort. The Royal Navy medical ship RFA Argus, which has a fully-equipped 100-bed hospital on board, set sail from Cornwall to Sierra Leone last week to join the humanitarian effort and is due to reach the area by the end of the month . But its facilities will not be used to treat Ebola patients themselves but will be there in case any of the UK military and civilian personnel working in the region become ill or are injured during the course of the operation. The RAF Argus left Britain for the West Coast of Africa last week as the Government ramped up its efforts to combat the outbreak of the disease . Britain has taken on responsibility for fighting the outbreak in Sierra Leone, while the US are leading in Liberia. The French government has agreed to take on the lead role combating the disease in its former colony of Guinea. Mr Cameron said: 'I think it is time for other countries to look at their responsibilities and their resources and act in a similar way to what Britain is doing in Sierra Leone, America is doing in Liberia, France is doing in Guinea. Other countries now need to step forward with resources and action because taking action at source in West Africa is the best way to protect all of us here in Europe.'","Philip Hammond tells foreign ministers to contribute more to £800m fund .

"A young mother told she was 'too young' for cancer is now fighting for her life after a delay in diagnosis allowed the disease to spread around her body. Ashley Daly, 27, now faces a double mastectomy if she is to see her young daughter grow up. The 27-year-old, of Cumnock, Ayrshire, has already begun chemotherapy treatment to beat the cancer, and has to wear a wig after losing her hair. She is now urging other young women to be aware of the disease - and believes they should demand further tests from doctors who dismiss their concerns due to age. Experts say rates of breast cancer have more than doubled in the last 30 years, blaming the rise on lifestyle factors such as obesity,  alcohol consumption and lack of exercise. However it is known that genetics also play a big role. Ashley Daly was told she was too young for breast cancer when she found a lump in May 2014. Now, the 27-year-old, with daughter Sophie, faces a double mastectomy to save her life after being diagnosed . Ms Daly is currently undergoing chemotherapy to beat the cancer, which has spread to her lymph nodes. She is pictured in hospital (left and right) receiving treatment and wearing a wig as it causes hair loss . When Ms Daly first went to the GP, she was referred for an ultrasound test but doctors said the lump was due to hormones. Six months later the lump was visible, her nipple was inverted, and she was diagnosed with stage three cancer. She is pictured with her partner Adam, 29 and daughter Sophie . When Miss Daly, a supermarket worker, first noticed the lump in May 2014, she thought that, at just 26, she was too young to get breast cancer. She only went to the GP after her partner Adam, 29, convinced her to go. She said: 'After the first appointment, the doctor recommended that I go to the hospital and get an ultrasound. 'They reassured that because of my young age, it was probably just fatty tissue and not cancer. 'They said it was perfectly common.' Breast cancer is extremely rare in women in their teens or early twenties and uncommon in women under 35. After this, age the risk begins to increase, and the majority of women diagnosed are over 50. Having a family history of breast cancer increases the risk of a woman developing the condition. Miss Daly's mother had been treated for a pre-cancerous breast condition, and has to be monitored by doctors in case it leads to cancer in future. The first symptom of breast cancer most women notice is a lump or an area of thickened tissue in their breast. Most breast lumps (90 per cent) aren't cancerous, but it's always best to have them checked by a doctor. Breast pain isn't usually a symptom of breast cancer. Source: NHS Choices . Her grandmother also had ovarian cancer, and a women's risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer is greatly increased she inherits a harmful mutation in the BRCA1 gene or the BRCA2 gene. However, Miss Daly was discharged after being told the lump had been caused by her hormones, and left the appointment feeling relieved. But six months later she found that her lump was not only still there, but had become bigger and more visible. She said: 'I got out of the shower and grabbed a hair-band to tie my hair up when I stopped in my tracks. 'My breast had completely changed. The lump had grown so big, it was visible and my nipples looked inverted.' Fearing the worst, she made an appointment with the GP again and was quickly referred for an emergency appointment to discover if it was cancer. After another scan and biopsy on the lump, doctors confirmed that it was cancer and that it had progressed to stage three. This meant that the cancer had spread from her breasts and had invaded her lymph nodes. She is currently undergoing intensive chemotherapy in preparation for having a double mastectomy. Now Miss Daly needs more tests to find out if she is a carrier of the BRCA gene, which would make her daughter more likely to develop cancer. She said: 'I've told Sophie that I am sick in a way that she understands. I told her that the medicine mummy is taking will make me feel poorly and that my hair would fall out.' 'Every time I wear my wig, she tells me to take it off because she likes my head without it. 'She will joke about it every once in a while, saying things like I don't need need to wash my hair any more. 'She's absolutely brilliant. I want to make sure I tell her everything and she doesn't feel left out or feel she's done something wrong.' Breast cancer is extremely rare in women in their teens or early twenties and uncommon in women under 35. Miss Daly was just 26 when she first noticed the lump . Now, Miss Daly writes about her experiences on Facebook, hoping that more young women will get themselves checked regularly. She said: 'I'm disappointed that I was initially dismissed because of my age. A more comprehensive test might have shown the lump for what it was. 'It just shows that you are never too young. 'You need to keep checking regularly, and don't accept age as an excuse for a lump. If you're not sure, always get a second opinion.' U.S. research has shown nearly twice as many young women are being diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer compared to 30 years ago. A study found that the rate of metastatic breast cancer - which has spread to other parts of the body - rose around two per cent each year between 1976 and 2009 among women aged 25 to 39. This is the most dangerous kind, with fewer than one-third of women surviving at least five years after diagnosis. Study author Dr Rebecca Johnson said the increased number of cases of the aggressive form of the disease could be linked to the rising rate of obesity as women eat more and exercise less. She added that hormonal birth control may play a role. In the UK, a 2011 study found one in eight women will now develop breast cancer in their lifetime and the rate is rising. Scientists blame obesity, alcohol and the growing tendency to delay motherhood for record levels of the disease. Up to 47,700 women are being diagnosed every year, equal to 130 a day - double the number 30 years ago.","Ashley Daly, 27, found a lump in her breast in May 2014 and went to the GP .

"Stoke chairman Peter Coates does not feel Tim Sherwood's appointment as Aston Villa manager will suddenly transform the club into winners. City head to Villa on Saturday for Sherwood's first official match in charge following back-to-back 4-1 defeats to Manchester City and Blackburn in the Barclays Premier League and FA Cup respectively. With manager Mark Hughes' side also struggling defensively due to a spate of injuries, and with Villa buoyed by their 2-1 FA Cup win over Leicester which Sherwood watched from the stands, many observers may feel a home victory is on the cards. Tim Sherwood was unveiled as Aston Villa's new manager on Monday following Paul Lambert's sacking . Sherwood faces the media for the first time since he was appointed as Villa's new boss . Sherwood watches with delight as Villa beat Leicester to progress to the sixth round FA Cup . Despite that, speaking to the Evening Sentinel, Coates said: 'The appointment of a new manager doesn't mean they have won the game already. 'The idea the world is suddenly transformed after bringing in a new manager doesn't ring true. 'I think it's about 50-50 statistically over whether you win or lose that first match. 'I remember going to Crystal Palace some years ago and people fearing the worst because Neil Warnock had just been appointed, but we came away with all three points.' Coates, meanwhile, has defended Hughes' decision to send defender Robert Huth on loan to Leicester despite the club's injury woes. Huth, only recently returning from his own long-term injury problems, joined the Foxes last month for the remainder of the campaign. Ryan Shawcross (left) and Marc Muniesa (right) have both suffered injuries at Stoke . Stoke allowed Robert Huth to join Leicester on loan in January but are now short of centre backs . Hughes, however, has suddenly lost Ryan Shawcross, Marc Wilson and Marc Muniesa, with little else available via way of cover. Coates said: 'Yes, I can understand why supporters would be asking 'why did you let him go?', but equally I can understand the management team's reasons for doing so. 'They wanted to give him games after his long-term knee injury and it was felt reserve games weren't suitable. 'We had also brought in Philipp Wollscheid to add to the centre-halves we had here. 'The timing was then very unfortunate with the injuries that followed the decision to let Robert go. 'Ryan has a wonderful appearance record, for instance, but then came that bad run of injuries which included him, Marc Wilson and now Marc Muniesa.'","Tim Sherwood was appointed as Aston Villa's new manager on Monday .

"The current Ebola crisis in West Africa is on pace to sicken more people than all other previous outbreaks of the disease combined, the health official leading the U.S. response said Thursday. The next few weeks will be critical, said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is sending more workers into the affected countries to help. 'It will be a long and hard fight,' Frieden told a congressional committee on Thursday. In his prepared testimony, he estimated it would take at least three to six months to end the outbreak, under what he called a best-case scenario. CDC Director Tom Frieden testifies before a subcommittee hearing on 'Combating the Ebola Threat' in DC on Thursday. He said quelling the spread of the deadly disease will be a 'long and hard fight' Frieden said the outbreak, which began in March, is unprecedented in part because it's in a region of Africa that never has dealt with Ebola before and has particularly weak health systems. He said the outbreak's two main drivers are lack of infection control as both health workers and families care for the sick and risky burial practices. More than 1,700 people have been sickened in the current outbreak, in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. Nearly 1,000 have died, according to the World Health Organization, or WHO. On Thursday Frieden said there's no way to know exactly how accurate that count is, or whether some cases are going unreported. 'The data coming out is kind of a fog-of-war situation,' he said. A medical charity told the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee that the world was too slow to react to the crisis, until recent headlines about two American aid workers who became infected in Liberia and were flown to the U.S. for care. Liberian nurses spraying disinfectant around a house after loading the body of an Ebola victim on a truck for burial on the outskirts of Monrovia on Wednesday. Liberia's president has declared a state of emergency in an attempt to stop the Ebola outbreak, which continues to spread across West Africa . An Ebola treatment center is constructed on Thursday in the village of Lakka on the outskirts of Freetown, Sierra Leone. While the Ebola virus outbreak has now reached four countries, Liberia and Sierra Leone account for more than 60 per cent of the deaths, according to the World Health Organization . 'Ebola is out of control in West Africa, and we are starting to see panic now around the world,' said Ken Isaacs, vice president at Samaritan's Purse. The two American aid workers, who were flown to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, 'seem to get a little better every day,' Isaacs said. Frieden didn't rule out the possibility that a traveler could arrive in the U.S. unknowingly infected with Ebola. But he said he is confident there will not be a large Ebola outbreak here. The CDC has put hospitals on alert for symptoms and to check whether people are recent travelers so that they can promptly isolate any suspected cases until proper testing can be done. Frieden said it is possible to stop the outbreak in West Africa using tried-and-true public health measures: find and isolate all possible patients, track down everyone they could have exposed, educate the public about risks and ensure health workers follow proper infection control. The virus is spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids of someone who is sick. Any case missed or exposed person lost to follow-up could keep the outbreak going. 'If you leave behind even a single burning ember, it's like a forest fire,' he said. 'It flares back up.' An ambulance arrives with American Ebola patient Dr Kent Brantly, right, to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia on Saturday. He was able to walk into the special quarantine wing with help . Medical workers roll patient Nancy Writebol into Emory University Hospital in Atlanta on Tuesday. Doctors said both the American aid workers, who had been in Liberia, were 'getting a little better every day' Isaacs of Samaritan's Purse said that a huge problem will be persuading African communities to abandon the traditional practice of washing the body and kissing the corpse immediately after death, when the body is most infectious. He said aid workers have been attacked when trying to intervene, and that some physicians in Liberia even mocked the existence of the Ebola virus, shunning protection around patients. The State Department said Thursday night it was ordering all eligible family members of U.S. personnel to leave the American Embassy in Monrovia, Liberia's capital, because of the Ebola outbreak. The department's medical office determined that there was a lack of options for routine health care services at major medical facilities due to the outbreak, a spokeswoman said. Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf declared a national state of emergency this week, and officials said Thursday that no one with a fever would be allowed in or out of the country. In the capital, there were reports of bodies abandoned in the streets. Relatives have been hiding feverish patients at home for fear that if they are brought to isolation centers and don't have Ebola, they will catch it. Troops were deployed there and in Sierra Leone to stem movement of possibly infected people. According to the WHO, Liberia and Sierra Leone account for more than 60 percent of the deaths so far. On Thursday, Frieden said Guinea was furthest along in responding to the outbreak although it is still spread there. The World Bank Group on Monday pledged as much as $200 million in emergency funding to fight the outbreak, including paying for urgently needed medical supplies, medical staff salaries and lab networks. On Thursday, the U.S. Agency for International Development said it was sending tens of thousands of protective suits for health care workers. At least one of the affected countries, Nigeria, has requested access to the experimental drug ZMapp, used on the two American aid workers. U.S. health officials have stressed that only extremely limited doses exist, the drug hasn't ever been tested in people and there's no proof it helped the two Americans. They have said it would take several months to make enough even for a small study. 'The plain fact is that we don't know whether that treatment is helpful, harmful or doesn't have any impact,' Frieden told the congressional subcommittee. He added, 'I don't want any false hopes out there.'","CDC director Dr Tom Frieden estimated it would take at least three to six months to end the outbreak, under what he called 'a best-case scenario'

"American soldiers in Afghanistan have been warned they may not be paid after President Obama failed in an 11th-hour attempt to reach a settlement over the U.S. deficit. In a crisis that has potentially devastating consequences for the world economy, the U.S. will run out of money to pay its bills next Wednesday unless squabbling Washington legislators raise the country's $14.3 trillion (£8.7tn) debt ceiling. Troops fighting in Afghanistan have been told that the Obama administration is expected to make their salaries a lower priority than interest payments to foreign bond-holders. Defeated: U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Saturday after the House rejected a Democratic proposal to raise the nation's debt ceiling . More than $1.2 trillion of America's vast debt is owned by China and another $328bn is owned by UK private investors and pension funds. The Obama administration is expected to continue to pay them next month, along with pensioners. Other social programmes, including medical care for the poor and help for the country's unemployed, also will be fully funded, according to insiders. But that will leave no money to pay federal employees, including troops. America's top military official, Admiral Mike Mullen, delivered the stunning news to soldiers at a meeting at Kandahar air base in southern Afghanistan. Asked if they will be paid if Mr Obama is unable to resolve the deadlock, he said: 'I honestly can't answer that question. 'I have confidence that at some point in time, whatever compensation you are owed, you will be given.' Troops will be ordered to continue to work, the admiral said. Economists say the U.S. could be plunged into recession if the Republican-controlled House and the Democratic Senate cannot agree on legislation. After weeks of intense partisanship, talks went late into the night at the White House on Saturday as leaders made a desperate, last-minute stab at compromise to avoid a government default. Some reports suggested 'significant progress' was being made. 'There is very little time,' declared President Barack Obama. Mr Obama met with top Democrats at the White House and spoke by phone with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. Tension: Even if the U.S. continues to make interest payments to creditors, it will unnerve the markets, said city analysts . Q: When will the U.S. officially run out of money?A: Wednesday. Q: Why is it broke?A: The U.S. government has reached its maximum debt level of $14.3 trillion. Q: Why doesn't it raise the debt ceiling? A: Because Tea Party militants have vetoed it. Q: Why?A: Because they want big spending cuts and refuse to back tax rises. Q: What is the official Republican position?A: Lift the debt limit in return for $1 trillion spending cuts. Q: What is President Obama's position?A: A bigger rise in the debt ceiling to avoid another crisis before the U.S. elections next year. Q: What if the U.S. defaults?A: It could suffer the humiliation of losing its triple A credit rating. Q. What is a triple A rating?A. The highest rate of credit worthiness a government can achieve. Q. What happens if the U.S. loses it?A. The government could have to pay more to borrow money. Q: How will that affect ordinary Americans?A: More firms will go bust, interest rates on credit cards and home loans will rise. 'He needs to indicate what he will sign, and we are in those discussions,' McConnell said of the President. He added he had also spoken with Vice . President Joe Biden, who played a prominent role in earlier attempts to . break the gridlock that has pushed the country to the verge of an . unprecedented default. A day after the Republican-controlled . House of Representatives passed a bill to cut the deficit and raise the . ceiling on government borrowing, the debt saga shifted to the . Democratic-led Senate where lawmakers scrambled for a deal. Senate Democrats pushed ahead with . their own plan, but sought to attract bipartisan support by adding some . elements of a proposal offered by Senate Republican leader Mitch . McConnell. But Senate Republicans appeared to . have the votes to block that bill and the House quickly crushed the . Democrats' proposal before the Senate acted on it, rejecting the measure . 246 to 173 in a fast-tracked vote set by the Republican leadership. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid postponed a closure vote on his debt plan, originally expected to happen at 1am on Sunday to 1pm. 'There are many elements to be finalized.  Many elements to be finalised. There is still a distance to go before any arrangement can be completed. 'But I believe we should give everyone as much room as possible to do their work,' he said. 'No one believes this will really happen,' a City financial expert told The Mail on Sunday, 'so no one has thought through the consequences. Even if the U.S. continues to make interest payments to creditors, it will unnerve markets and probably lead to a lowering of its credit rating. 'That means the value of U.S. bonds held by banks will fall and they will have to raise more capital in order to meet their required asset levels and that in turn could force up interest rates, causing a recession.' Senate Democrats killed a bill passed by the Republican-controlled House late on Friday. Democrats opposed it as 'extremist' while Right-wingers said it did not go far enough. And all 43 Republicans in the Senate have signed a letter, saying they will not vote for a rival Democrat plan to raise the debt limit. Mr Obama pleaded for compromise, saying: 'There is very little time.' As the warring continued, Mr Obama was described by The New York Times, as 'largely a bystander'.","Soldiers told their salaries are lower priority than interest payments to foreign bond-holders .

"Millions of GM mosquitoes created in British laboratories are about to be released into the jungles of Panama to tackle the spread of Dengue Fever to humans. The idea is that the male insects are on a suicide mission which involves mating with wild females before they and their offspring die. This, in theory, will reduce the number of wild mosquitoes which carry and spread Dengue Fever, which causes serious symptoms ranging from high temperatures and muscle pain to bleeding. The latest initiative follows a similar project earlier this year in which genetically modified mosquitoes were created to combat the fever . However, British campaigners warn that proper safeguards have not been established with the result that unintended consequences could make the disease situation even worse. The UK company Oxitec, has developed the technology to create genetically modified insects which, it claims, can also be used instead of chemicals to protect food crops from pests. The firm has held preliminary talks with UK authorities about releasing GM insects into UK fields or greenhouses to reduce pest numbers. The GM mosquito trials are due to start on February 15 in Nuevo Chorillo, in the Arraiján district of Panama. Scientists have used Mosquitoes for researching the spread of disease for years, often using themselves as human guinea pigs in the experiments . Oxitec conducted its first experiments of GM mosquitoes in the Cayman Islands in 2009 and 2010, followed by a smaller experiment in Malaysia in 2010 and 11. In several trials, successive releases of the Oxitec males have been shown to reduce substantially the wild population of dengue mosquitoes in the treated area . They have been approved by the Ministry of Health but critics claim no information about the possible downsides have been provided to members of the public. Oxitec conducted its first open release experiments of GM mosquitoes in the Cayman Islands in 2009-10 followed by a smaller experiment in Malaysia in 2010-11. Both countries have halted further releases. Larger-scale experiments began in Brazil in February 2011 and are still on-going. Director of GeneWatch UK, Dr Helen Wallace, said: ‘Local people should be aware that releasing large numbers of GM mosquitoes can pose risks to their health and the environment. 'They also need to know who will be liable if anything goes wrong. Will Oxitec take responsibility for any problems, or just walk away?’ GeneWatch said changes could be introduced into the wild population which means the Dengue Fever they spread becomes more dangerous to humans. There is currently no vaccine for dengue fever so authorities advise the best way to prevent catching the infection is to take precautions when travelling in high-risk areas, such as wearing protective clothing or using a mosquito repellent, stock image pictured, throughout the day and night . It claims that if the numbers of one type of mosquito - Aedes aegypti – is reduced as result of the release of GM versions, others, such as the Asian Tiger mosquito, which also carry the virus, could come in and thrive. It said there is no evidence from experiments conducted to date that human cases of Dengue Fever fall as a result of releasing the GM insects. The release of GM insects is supposed to involve only males, however it has emerged that a large number of biting female mosquitoes have also been released during experiments. ‘Local people should be aware that releasing large numbers of GM mosquitoes can pose risks to their health and the environment. 'They . also need to know who will be liable if anything goes wrong. Will . Oxitec take responsibility for any problems, or just walk away?’ Oxitec’s chief executive, Hadyn Parry, insisted the release of the insects is being properly policed. He said: ‘Panama have been through a rigorous regulatory review of Oxitec’s GM mosquitoes. 'Approval for the evaluation has been given by  Panama’s National Biosafety Committee, the Ministries of Agricultural Development and Commerce and Industry. ‘Over the last five years there has also been  considerable public engagement within Panama at national and local levels, in which GeneWatch has been involved, and no doubt this consultation process will continue. ‘The evaluation will be conducted by the Gorgas Institute, an institute with a worldwide reputation in developing approaches to combat disease carrying mosquitoes. ‘We believe GeneWatch should respect the sovereignty, expertise and authority of Panama in making decisions for the benefit of their own people.’","Male mosquitoes to be sent on suicide mission to mate with wild females .

"A heart-warming video that shows homeless people in Los Angeles receiving incredible makeovers has emerged online. The black and white clip features a series of homeless men sat outside under a canopy  before and after voluntary barbers cut their hair and shave their beards. The resulting reactions from the men are moving – one cradles his hands with a smile while another, seemingly lost for words after looking at himself in the mirror, hugs the barber appreciatively. The video – the brainchild of filmmaker Tyler Bridges – is in an attempt to challenge certain misconceptions regarding homelessness, and proves that the people featured are no different to anyone else. It also highlights the shocking statistic that there are currently over 600,000 people experiencing homelessness in the United States. The campaigning video states that it is not the differences in our age, wealth, ability or social standing that defines us as we are all the same inside. Wonderful gesture: Volunteering barbers cut the hair of a number of homeless people from the Union Rescue Mission in Los Angeles . The moving footage was taken at the Union Rescue Mission and concludes by calling for its viewers to get involved with their local shelter or mission.

"An orphaned black boy, growing up in Victorian Britain, becomes a hero on the football pitch for Tottenham Hotspur, despite suffering abuse from the terraces. Then he goes on to become the first black officer in the British Army, mentioned in Dispatches and recommended for the Military Cross for heroism in the First World War. It ought to be the most inspiring story. But at the same time, it is one of the most heartbreaking. Because at 29 Second Lieutenant Walter Tull was killed in action in France, and due to the colour of his skin he was never officially recognised for his gallantry. And although he died a hero’s death in 1918, to this day no one knows where his body lies: his name is among the 30,000 soldiers with no known grave, remembered on the war memorial at Arras. Role model: Walter Tull, pictured in his Tottenham Hotspurs kit during his football days, broke barriers . But now, with the help of War Horse . author Michael Morpurgo, there is a chance that these omissions will be . rectified. Morpurgo says his latest novel was inspired by Tull’s story, . and has called for him to be officially recognised with a posthumous . medal and a statue outside the Imperial War Museum in London. Such honours would be a far cry from Tull’s humble origins. His father, Daniel, the son of slaves, came to Britain from Barbados to work as a carpenter, settling in Kent and marrying a local woman. Walter was born in Folkestone in 1888. But by 1897 both Walter’s parents had died and Walter and his brother Edward were moved to a children’s home in London’s East End. Edward was quickly adopted, leaving Walter alone. Every morning before lessons he would have to wash in freezing cold water, clean at least 15 pairs of boots and scrub floors on his knees. War hero: Walter Tull with fellow officers after being promoted to second lieutenant in 1917, a year before he died in battle at the age of 29 . Then he started playing football and was soon signed by local team Clapton FC, who promptly won every cup available to them in 1908. Next season he was taken on as an inside forward by Spurs for a transfer fee of £10. He was paid £4 a week, the top wage at the time. He became the first black outfield player at a First Division club. The only black professional footballer in Britain before him was goalkeeper Arthur Wharton. But, at a time when there were very few black faces in Britain, Tull was to endure racial abuse from the terraces. In October 1909, after a match against . Bristol City, a reporter wrote of the City fans: ‘They made a cowardly . attack upon him in language lower than Billingsgate. Tull is so clean in . mind and method as to be a model for all white men.’ However, Tull was soon dropped from the . Spurs first team, never to regain a regular spot. When war was declared . in 1914, he volunteered and joined the Football Battalion 17th Middlesex . Regiment. He was promoted three times during training and was sent to France, close to the front line. In 1916, despite having suffered severely from shell shock, he fought so courageously on the Somme that his commanding officers recommended promotion, and in 1917 he was made a second lieutenant. After leading a raiding party across enemy lines on the Alpine Italian Front in the harsh winter of 1917-18, he was put forward for the Military Cross for his outstanding bravery and leadership and was mentioned in Dispatches for his ‘gallantry and coolness’ under fire. In memoriam: Walter Tull is remembered among 30,000 other soldiers with no grave at Arras, France . But two months later, while crossing No Man’s Land on the Western Front in France, he was shot and killed. The fighting was so severe that his body was never recovered. In those days, Army officers had to be ‘of pure European descent’. By making him an officer, Tull’s superiors had thrown away the rule book. But after the war, the colour of his skin meant he was never awarded his Military Cross. Now, the campaign to reverse this decision is gathering steam. As well as Morpurgo’s efforts, Northampton MP Brian Binley is supporting an online Number 10 petition calling for Tull to be posthumously awarded the medal. Binley, Tory MP for Northampton South, also says Tull’s departure from Tottenham was more about the racism Tull encountered than football: ‘I believe Spurs were embarrassed by what happened and wanted to get rid of him.’ The MP says his fight has recently hit a ‘brick wall’ at the Ministry of Defence: ‘They gave me the excuse that a soldier couldn’t be awarded a Military Cross posthumously in those days. I found one who had but they weren’t interested.’ The campaign has coincided with a new book for children: Walter Tull’s Scrapbook by Michaela Morgan, and on Thursday a play, simply called Tull, opened at Bolton’s Octagon Theatre. The Morpurgo novel inspired by Tull is A Medal For Leroy. Aimed at children, it is dedicated to Walter’s memory and tells of a boy finding out about his black RAF pilot father, who died in the war. Morpurgo says he wants a Tull statue in London ‘so the children of today, black and white, can see how long and how honourably black people have been serving in the Armed Forces. I simply felt more people should know about this remarkable man’. Walter Tull’s Scrapbook, by Michaela Morgan, is published by Frances Lincoln for £11.99.

"Brit: Mohammed Hadi is believed to have travelled to Syria to join ISIS, an increasingly-powerful Islamic militant group causing chaos in the Middle East . A British teenager has joined the fanatical band of Islamic terrorists rampaging across Syria and Iraq and killing thousands, it has been reported. Mohammed Hadi, 18, from Coventry in the West Midlands, is believed to have joined ISIS, an increasingly-powerful Islamic militant group leaving a trail   of dead in the troubled region. The youngster, of Iraqi Kurdish extraction, is known as 'Osama Bin Bieber' after the Canadian pop star because his youthful appearance. Hadi is said to have been radicalised by extremist clerics at a madrassa (religious school) in the city and travelled to the Middle east with three   other men. He has posted pictures of himself on Instagram holding guns, and posted tweets claiming to be in Syria with ‘Dawla’, another name for ISIS. His parents are believed to have reported him missing to police back in March. It has . also been reported that police were previously warned about his growing extremist . outlook. The Sun On Sunday spoke to Mahir Hadi, 38, the father of the teenager. He said: 'We can't talk about it - I don't know anything about it. The police   know better than me.' Twitter users have reported that Hadi, also known as Abu Yahya Al Kurdy, is currently near the northern Syrian town of Sarrin with a group of Chechens. Reso Bistuyek posted: 'Abu Yahya Al Kurdy (also known as Osama Bin Bieber) hangs out w/ Chechens of the Jarablus/Sarrin crowd'. Scroll down for video . Some Twitter users have dubbed the teenager 'Osama Bin Bieber' because he looks so young. He also calls himself Abu Yahya Al Kurdy . Meanwhile, Nova K. Doski, a London-based . Kurd, posted: 'I'm still laughing at this toddler. I said from the . start he will become a terrorist.' A Coventry local said he saw the teenager's father in tears after discovering what he had done. He said: 'He was so frightened that he would die out there and was furious his on had   persuaded his son to do something crazy.' An Imam at the madrassa said Hadi did attend but when he discovered his plans to travel to the strife-hit region he called West Midlands Police. Recruitment: Isis posted a video showing British men urging others to take up arms and join them . Joining the extremists: This picture is understood to be Aseel Muthana, the 17-year-old younger brother of Nasser, who has travelled to the Middle East to fight . A video purporting to show the execution of Iraqi soldiers by ISIS extremists in the Salaheddin province, Iraq . A spokeswoman said: 'Police are investigating the whereabouts of an 18-year-old man from the Stoke Heath area of Coventry as a result of concerns raised by family members. The man was last seen on 26 March. 'Officers are keeping an open mind as to the man’s whereabouts; however the investigation is being led by officers from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit and one line of enquiry is that he has travelled to Syria.' Dr Abdullah Shehu, who chairs the Coventry Muslim Forum, told the Coventry Telegraph he did not know of any local people who have travelled to Syria to join ISIS. He said: 'This is something that the Coventry Muslim Forum have morally condemned. We advise people never to engage in such a practice at all. 'We work closely with the police and with the council in order to prevent these actions.' Hadi is a . former pupil of the city's Sidney Stringer Academy, which hit the . national headlines in 2010 when a 13-year-old pupil was threatened by . other pupils after   praising British troops in Afghanistan. Taking no prisoners: Footage posted on YouTube appears to show ISIS militants carrying out summary executions on dozens of captured soldiers in Syria . Police . became involved and two boys were excluded from the school. The news about Hadi comes soon after two Britons were seen in an ISIS recruitment video urging other British Islamists to join their holy war. Reyaad Khan, 20, sits with a Kalashnikov assault rifle against his shoulder alongside 20-year-old gap-year student Nasser Muthana – also seen in the video urging Britons to join ISIS militants in Iraq and Syria. Nasser had taken £100 from his father to go on an Islamic seminar in Shrewsbury in November, but instead went to Syria.

Police across the UK have made 65 Syria-related arrests over the last 18 months, including 40 in the first three months of this year alone. Yesterday it emerged that around 500 Britons had travelled to Syria and Iraq - a higher estimate than the 400 claimed by Foreign Secretary William   Hague. Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan Police's assistant commissioner and head of specialist operations, warned that Britain would feel the long-term   consequences of the conflict for 'many years to come'. She said it represented a terrorist threat to the UK, and that young British Muslims who have travelled to the war-torn country to fight might commit   violence when they return. 'I'm afraid I believe that we will be living with the consequences of Syria - from a terrorist point of view, let alone the world, geopolitical   consequences - for many, many, many years to come,' Ms Dick told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend.","Mohammed Hadi, 18, believed to have travelled to war-torn region to fight .

"Campaign: Demi Bowers wants the law to change to give victims better protection from their sexual attackers . A teenager who has been forced to move out of her family home because a paedophile who molested her lives across the road is calling for a change in the law. Demi Bowers, 18, said it's 'disgusting and appalling' that her attacker, John Breckon, is permitted to reside so close to her in Bridlington. As reported in the MailOnline earlier this week, Breckon, 51, was as jailed in 2010 at Hull Crown Court after he admitted sexual activity with a child. He was released in 2012 after serving half his two-and-a-half-year sentence and was initially banned from Bridlington. However, the restriction ended in February last year. As he owns the house opposite where Demi lived with her family, he was allowed to resume living there. Demi recalled on today's This Morning how she was shocked and scared to see him outside his house gardening a year after his release from prison. 'Why only a year? A year doesn't do anything,' she told presenters Rochelle and Marvin Humes. As a result, she is now campaigning for the law to be changed with a change.org petition called 'Demi's Law' which has currently gained 390 signatures. The teenager said it's unfair that victims like her seem to have less rights than their attackers. Ordeal: This Morning presenter Rochelle Humes hands Demi a tissue as she becomes emotional sharing her story on today's show . She said: 'What I am asking is pretty small - just . for zones to be out in place for a longer period. How are you supposed . to re-build your life? Not everyone has to have them living across the . road but it's still a life sentence, no one should have to live with . this.' Demi explained on the ITV show how her ordeal began when she started babysitting for John and his wife when she was 13. She explained: 'Before I met John I had a loving family home, school life was good, everything was just normal. I wasn't very outgoing, I was very family orientated. 'He was left the house opposite ours when his mother died. He and his wife were doing it up so they could move in and I would help babysitting his little girl. I would look after her after school and in the holidays.' Demi said she loved babysitting the little girl and refused to be paid for it by John and his wife. So she didn't think anything of it when John began lavishing her with expensive gifts. She thought it was his way of repaying her for babysitting but now she realises he had been grooming her. Demi was joined on the sofa by Fay Maxted, far right, CEO of the Survivors Trust who are supporting her and her petition for change . After enduring sexual abuse at his hands, she eventually found the courage to tell a teacher what was happening and Breckon was jailed. But now he is a free man again, Demi feels too scared to live near him in her family home. As a result, she has moved away with her partner, Natalia Bowers, 25. Demi said: 'We hit a brick wall, no-one was prepared to do anything. They said it's his home, he can go where he wants.' Demi wept on This Morning when she viewed a video interview of her mother, Angela Kingston, who explained how the family had been torn apart thanks to Breckon living across the street. Family torn apart: Demi wept when she saw a video message from her mother, who is upset that her daughter has had to move away from the family thanks to her attacker living on their street . Action: The change.org petition Demi and her family have started calling for a change to the law . Angela said: 'We decided to move here because Bridlington is a small town with a close-knit community. 'We thought it would be a safe place to bring Demi and our children up. We never thought we would be living this nightmare.' She added: 'Every day I think about what I would like to do to my daughter's attacker, they are very disturbing thoughts but what gets me through is the welfare of my children. 'I miss Demi every single day. She's missing out on her siblings growing up. I feel guilty that Demi isn't part of that and that's the most difficult thing.'

"Cristiano Ronaldo scored a record 35th goal in the Champions League knockout stages with a nod of the head against Schalke on Wednesday night. Ronaldo's 58th goal in as many games for Real Madrid was his first ever scored with his head away from the Bernabeu in Europe's elite competition. Ronaldo continues to make fools of the best defenders in the world and not just in his own backyard, having scored in seven different countries - Spain, Italy, England, Portugal, Russia, Turkey and Germany - and 11 different cities since 2007. Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 35th goal in the Champions League knockout stages and he has netted in 11 different cities in the process . Ronaldo's first-half header sent Madrid on their way to a 10th successive Champions League victory . The ball goes into the back of the net as Ronaldo scores and breaks yet more records in the Champions League for Real . Portugal superstar Ronaldo has now scored 58 Champions League goals in as many games for Real with his latest against Schalke . Ronaldo leaps into his trademark celebration following his opening goal in Gelsenkirchen against Schalke . The 2-0 victory over Schalke was also saw Ronaldo grab his 12th consecutive away goal in Europe . Right foot: 43 . Left foot: 11 . Headed: 4 . Penalty: 7 . Home goals: 26 . Away goals: 32 . His first goal of the 35 came for Manchester United against Roma at Old Trafford on April 10, 2007, before his header  a year later against Chelsea on neutral ground in Moscow helped Sir Alex Ferguson win the Champions League final. He's since swapped England for Spain, and Real's 2-0 victory over Schalke became his 28th win in the knockout stages - yet another record, overtaking Edwin van der Sar and Victor Valdes on 27. The Portugal international was under pressure to perform in Germany. His run of three games without scoring was unheard of, given he had not went through such a drought since February 2011. Yet the fact that such a fuss was kicked up over Ronaldo not scoring against Cordoba, Atletico Madrid or Deportivo in La Liga is testament to his talent, and the expectations that follow. Thankfully the Bernabeu boo boys were not given ammunition to scrutinise him for long. Not when Ronaldo's track record on German territory has seen him score in three different cities against Borussia Dortmund, Bayern Munich and Schalke. The three-time Ballon d'Or winner netted against Schalke at the Veltins-Arena in February 2014, and doing so again a year later on Wednesday night meant he scored in his 12th consecutive Champions League away match. Another record. It helped Real win their 10th consecutive Champions League game - a record on par with Bayern Munich, which was set in December 2013. That run was ended by Manchester City, but Ronaldo will be looking to go one further. Beat Schalke at the Bernabeu on March 10, and it's theirs. As long as Lionel Messi is around, there will  be the debate as who's better. The race is on with Ronaldo, Messi and Raul level on 76 goals in European competitions. Yet Cristiano has an added incentive. The 30-year-old is now responsible for more than a quarter (72 of 274) of  goals scored by Portuguese players in the history of the Champions League, and won't want to give that up without a fight. So, can Real become the first European champions to retain the title? The way the records are tumbling for Ronaldo, you wouldn't bet against it.

Footage from Tuesday showed Souleymane S, a 33-year-old born in Paris, twice being shoved back on to the platform at Richelieu-Drouot station before a group of Chelsea fans chant: 'We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it.'

'I didn't know I was being filmed, speaking about it has now given me the confidence to go and complain to the police,' Souleymane told French newspaper Le Parisien. 'I'm going to try and do it tomorrow (Thursday), if I have the time, because I have to work. 'These people, these English fans, must be found, punished and locked up. They can't be allowed to get away with it.' The supporters were travelling to Chelsea's Champions League last 16 tie with Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes when their vile chants were filmed at about 7.30pm. Souleymane lives in the Val-d'Oise department to the north of Paris and was returning home from work when Paul Nolan, a British expat, caught the altercation on camera. 'I wanted to get into the carriage but a group of English fans blocked me and pushed me away,' Souleymane continued. 'I tried to force my way on, I kept trying to get back on. In the scramble, I lost my phone. They told me things in English but I did not really understand the meaning of their words. 'I don't speak a word of English. I understood that they were Chelsea fans, and I made the connection with the PSG match, which was taking place the same evening. 'I also understood that they were attacking me because of the colour of my skin. 'You know, I live with racism, I was not really surprised by what happened to me, even if it was a first in the Metro. 'I stood in front of them for a long time. Someone came up to me afterwards and said I'd been brave to stand up to such people. I think the whole thing lasted about six or seven minutes.' The Paris prosecutor's office opened an investigation on Wednesday into 'voluntary racial violence on public transport', which is punishable by up to three years in prison and a £33,000 fine. Scotland Yard confirmed they would 'examine the footage with a view to seeing if we can apply for football banning orders', while the Metropolitan Police added they would 'assist French authorities'.

"The Arctic Star: This new medal with honour the heroes of the 'Russian Run' convoys . They have waited for their sacrifice to be recognised for 70 years. But next month the 200 frail veterans of the Arctic Convoys will finally have campaign medals pinned to their chests. Today the Daily Mail can reveal the design of the award that will be worn proudly by the dwindling band of survivors of the ‘Russian Run’ during the Second World War. The 4cm by 4cm medal will hang from a ribbon incorporating colours that represent the three Armed Services, red for the Merchant Navy and a central white stripe, emphasised by black edging, marking the Arctic. It will be embossed with King George VI’s cipher - the letters G, R and I - and carry the words ‘The Arctic Star’. Designs were submitted by the Ministry of Defence to the Royal Mint Advisory Committee and their recommendation was submitted to The Queen for approval. The awarding of the medal is a victory for the Daily Mail’s campaign to win recognition for the veterans of the convoys. As many as 250,000 veterans or their families could be eligible for the new award. Defence Minister Mark Francois will announce today the details of the Arctic Star to mark the ‘heroism and bravery’ of those who served on ships keeping Russia supplied and fighting in the war. Production of the medals will begin this week and the first ones will be awarded to survivors ‘as a matter of priority’ within a month. Medals will also be awarded posthumously, meaning widows and families of those Arctic Convoy veterans who died during the Second World War or since can collect one on their behalf. The family of Commander Eddie Grenfell, 93, the leader of the 16-year campaign for justice, said he would be ‘extremely proud and relieved’. Frozen hell: Sailors chipping away the ice and snow from the deck of H.M.S. Vansittart while on convoy escort duty in the Arctic in February 1943 . Appalling cold: Snow and ice covered the upper works of all ships. Some 3,000 servicemen were awarded bravery medals for taking part in the daring campaign . Cdr Grenfell, who miraculously survived ten minutes in the icy Arctic waters before he was rescued after his ship SS Empire Lawrence was bombed in May 1942, is in hospital in Portsmouth after suffered a near-fatal heart attack. His daughter Trudie Grenfell, 64, said: ‘This is absolutely wonderful news. I know he can’t wait to hold the medal in his own hand and wear it on his chest.’ More than 3,000 British naval and merchant seaman died between 1941 and 1945 on the convoys, risking their lives braving sub-zero temperatures, ferocious seas and a gauntlet of German warplanes and U-boats. The ice-covered convoys carried four million tonnes of cargo including tanks, warplanes, fuel and food to slow Germany’s advances on the Eastern front. Brave veterans of the Arctic Convoy, pictured last year . More than 66,000 Royal Navy sailors and merchant seamen took part in what Winston Churchill described as the ‘worst journey in the world’. Eighty-seven merchant ships and 18 Royal Navy warships were sunk. However, the onset of the Cold War meant it was politically difficult to give them a medal for assisting the Soviet Union and it only now their sacrifice has been properly recognised. Those eligible for the new Arctic Star are all those who served for any length of time north of the Arctic Circle. Hero: In perilous conditions a sailor frees chains, wires and bollards from the ice . Unsung: One of 78 convoys that braved frozen seas to help win the war . But David Cameron was accused of dragging his feet after promising to act two years ago amid concerns veterans would die before the medals are actually awarded. In a linked announcement, the design of a campaign clasp for the airmen of Bomber Command will be unveiled. It will match the Battle of Britain clasp given to Fighter Command personnel. Mr Cameron acted after accepting the recommendations of a review of military medals carried out by former diplomat Sir John Holmes. People can apply for the medal on the website www.veterans-uk.info or by telephoning 0845 780 0900.

At a previous hearing, a court was told that the schoolboy had stabbed a male teacher and injured a girl in the classroom because he had 'wanted to hurt someone' 'He has never done it before and, although I accept completely your concerns, to lock someone up you have to have more than concerns that he will do it again. 'It is quite clear that if dealt with firmly, he does not pose any further problems. Last night, he was very upset.' The school carried out a review after the incident and said it was satisfied with its security procedures. At the time headteacher Richard Jacobs said: 'It was a very distressing day for everyone at the school. 'Our thoughts and prayers have been with everyone who was directly involved in the incident and we are relieved that they are able to join us as we return to normal school life.

Today, Detective Inspector Andy Price, of West Mercia Police, said: 'We acknowledge the decision of the youth court and the support that will be put in place for the defendant. 'I'd like to thank the victims, witnesses and staff and pupils at the school for their support in what has been a challenging investigation for everyone concerned.' Superintendent Mark Travis added: 'I think the school did an excellent job in the way it reacted in a very professional way considering what was a confused and stressful situation. 'They did the best they could to give information but it clearly takes time. 'I think parents and pupils conducted themselves with real control.'","Boy launched attack at Chase Technology College in Malvern in September .

The 26-year-old, who spent 12 years with Saints, became the subject of a protracted and high-profile transfer saga last summer with the Reds making three separate bids before they were successful. In between those offers there was speculation Lallana had tried to force Southampton's hand by issuing an ultimatum but the player denies that. A deal in the region of £25m was finally agreed but the acrimonious manner of his departure still rankles with fans, who were not assuaged by a full page advert Lallana placed in the local newspaper offering his thanks. Adam Lallana is given instructions by manager Brendan Rodgers during Liverpool training on Wednesday . Lallana (right) regrets the acrimonious circumstances under which he left former club Southampton . He returns to St Mary's on Sunday where he expects to get a less-than-warm welcome. 'I'm not stupid enough to think the way I left didn't leave a sour taste in a few people's mouths,' he told BBC Radio Solent . 'I regret the way I left. I regret bits and pieces of how it happened and it got nasty. It was sad the way it happened. 'What is true is that when I knew of Liverpool's interest and that they had put a bid in, I did say to the club it would be my wish if they could negotiate a fee for me to move on. 'Not for one second did I say I wouldn't play for the club again. I'm man enough to say it was my choice and my decision for me to move on. Lallana celebrates after netting the winning goal in Liverpool's FA Cup fifth round win over Crystal Palace . The midfielder slides on his knees after helping Liverpool book their place in the quarter-finals . 'Deep down I hope Saints fans appreciate the times we had at the club together. 'Football is a fickle game - if I do get the jeers and the boos I'm just going to take it as them missing me playing down there because I miss Southampton. 'I miss the fans and I miss the good times we had down there. Of course I do.' Lallana missed the game at Anfield through injury and he admits it will be a strange feeling lining up against his former side this weekend. 'It's still not sunk in that I'm going to be playing against Southampton,' he added. Lallana joined Liverpool from Southampton last summer for a fee in the region of £25m . 'I think it was a blessing in disguise that I was injured for the first game. 'Even being in the crowd watching that day I just felt really emotional so to have been out there would have been way too soon. 'The rawness of it all has got easier over the past six months. 'I've got huge respect for the club; part of me doesn't even know how I'm going to play. It's all a bit surreal. 'I just have to be professional and play well for Liverpool. I've got too much respect to celebrate (if he scores).'","Liverpool face Besiktas in the Europa League at Anfield on Thursday .

"Writing a journal has been one small factor in Danny Cipriani’s career revival and, after his try-scoring return for England at Twickenham on Saturday, he knew what the next entry would be. ‘Probably about the reaction I got, which was very humbling,’ said the Sale fly-half, after his first appearance at HQ since 2008. The 27-year-old was touched by the hearty ovation from the capacity crowd when he came on as a last-quarter replacement and he responded by scoring seconds later, as England put Italy to the sword. Danny Cipriani vowed that he has learnt his lessons after England return on Saturday . The Sale fly-half scored in a substitute appearance for England in their 47-17 victory over Italy . The 27-year-old said he was touched by the hearty ovation he received from the Twickenham crowd . ‘I did feel like I had been away for a while and it was one of the highlights of my career to get back out there,’ said Cipriani. ‘The reaction I got from the crowd filled me with confidence. I saw Jonny (May) going down the wing and he gave me the pass. He did all the work to be honest. It was a fast start for me, but it was all down to Jonny. I was on the receiving end for once, which was nice.’ Almost seven years ago, the then Wasps No 10 illuminated the national stadium with a breathtaking playmaker’s display on his full Test debut — orchestrating an emphatic victory over Ireland. Yet his cameo against the Azzurri was his first outing in the RBS 6 Nations since that heady day, as injury, a stint in Australia and misgivings about his attitude checked the rise of a stellar talent. But he has knuckled down at Sale — aided by Jonny Wilkinson’s mentor, Steve Black — and forced his way into Stuart Lancaster’s World Cup plans, as back-up to first-choice fly-half George Ford. The Sale fly-half said his return to Twickenham Stadium was one of the highlights of his career . Cipriani (right) enjoyed his return to Twickenham as he tackles Italy's Francesco Minto on Saturday (left) Asked how he had changed since he ran amok at Twickenham as a 20-year-old rookie, Cipriani said: ‘I’m just a bit older and uglier I guess! ‘I’ve learned a lot of lessons in the last seven years. If someone had told me to meet Steve Black when I was 20, I would probably have politely declined. You don’t think about those things at that age, but as you get older you mature and see things in a different light. You grow up and gaps in your life get filled. I just feel like I’m in a much wiser position and more stable. But I’m only 27, so I’m a good three or four years off my peak — and I can still shift about a bit!’ Back in 2008, rugby seemed to come easily to Cipriani, even at Test level, but he admits that he didn’t savour the honours that came his way. In that regard, he is making up for lost time. ‘I probably took it for granted a bit back then,’ he said. ‘You don’t really appreciate the moments as they come along. That’s what I’m doing now, appreciating every moment and experience and there’s no way I want to be out of this England side ever again for as long as I’m playing. I’m very focused on making the best of my ability.’ Cipriani (right) has said he is determined to be patient and seize any opportunities that come his way . When the national team beat Wales at the start of their championship campaign in Cardiff, Cipriani was an unused replacement. At Twickenham last weekend he was brought on 17 minutes from the end but made his presence felt. He knows that Owen Farrell will be back from injury and on the coaches’ radar again long before the World Cup but Cipriani is determined to be patient and seize any opportunities that come his way. ‘Any chance I get to get on the field, I try to take it,’ he said. ‘Everyone on the bench is like that . . . I am not going to wish anyone else to slip up. I am just going to keep working on what I am doing and at some point the opportunity may come. ‘It’s all building blocks and moving forward. If I have to come on for 18 or 19 minutes and put my hand up in that time, that’s what I’m going to have to do. ‘If I have to come on for the last five minutes and kick the leather off the ball or whatever it is, I will keep doing it.’ These are the selfless sentiments which have helped Cipriani regain an England place and prove that he is indeed wiser now.","Danny Cipriani scored on his return to Twickenham on Saturday .

"Angela Brower made the brave move of breaking up with her boyfriend of six months after he started becoming physically and verbally abusive. But on May 18, when Walter Bradley came over to collect his things, the 37-year-old Tennessee woman was allegedly viciously attacked. Brower says she was punched so hard she was knocked out and woke to still find the man beating her. She managed to plead with him to spare her life, The Huffington Post reports. Scroll down for video . Appalling: Angela Brower, 37, of Memphis, Tennessee, says that on May 18, her ex-boyfriend, Walter Bradley, came to her house and attacked her, smashing the orbital bone around her eye, breaking her nose, and leaving her with extensive bruising . Aggravated assault: Walter Bradley (left) has been charged with allegedly attacking ex-girlfriend Angela Brower (right), leaving her with injuries so bad she required serious surgery . The Memphis mom said she not trying to offend anyone with the pictures, but raise awareness for an issue that needs more support . On-the-mend: Angela Brower posted this selfie before undergoing surgery . Her ex-boyfriend has been charged with aggravated assault, according to WREG News Channel 3, and Brower has taken it upon herself to spread awareness about domestic violence. The Memphis mom has posted pictures of her injuries and subsequent recovery on her Facebook page since the attack, first writing:'Does this look like LOVE TO ANYONE OF YOU?' 'I just want everyone to be aware that I'm NOT posting pics to hurt anyone, nor make them relive any abuse they've been through!' Brower wrote. 'I am posting them to make people (especially women) aware of domestic abuse! 'To let them know this is NOT OK & it's also NOT THEIR FAULT! 'The abuse only gets worse EVERYTIME it reoccurs! Ladies, you may not always be able to walk away the next time! 'I want EVERYONE of you to know if you need someone to talk to about anything I would love to talk with you! 'I Love all of you & just want to be the example for abused/battered women!' Her ex-husband is standing by her through the abusive former relationship. 'She is lucky to be alive,' Jason Brower told WREG. 'She finally came to the realization that it’s time for women to start standing up and not being scared.'. Brower said she feels she could understand the situations many women found themselves in. She regretfully took her boyfriend back after he hit her the first time. But she's making sure the second time will definitely be the last. Brower said she wrongly accepted her ex back into her life after he hit her the first time, and said that it is a mistake many women make. She is trying to help other victims . 'I made a mistake and I took him back, and everything was OK for a little while,' she told The Huffington Post. 'If you have never been there, you can’t understand why people go back. 'Women follow their heart, they love them, they want to believe them when they say they will change, they lose their friends and family and don’t feel like they have anyone.' Doctors have placed a metal ring around her eye to stop it from collapsing, according to her posts. Late last month, Angela Brower underwent surgery to remove bone fragments from her face and to place a metal ring around her eye to stop it from collapsing . Healing: Doctors say it will take two to three months for Brower to be fully recovered . 'This isn't Love, nor is it how you show your Love for anyone!!!! No one deserves this!!!' Brower posted on her Facebook . Graphic: Brower posted this photo to show how much blood had come out of her eye, which was seriously injured in the attack . 'I have health insurance, but it only covers half the costs,' she continued. 'I don’t want to lose everything I have because I fell in love with the wrong person.'

"A computer programmer bragged on Facebook that he was the first person in the world to pirate a copy of the movie Fast & Furious 6 – but was caught after he used his hacker name on his dating profile. Philip Danks, 25, secretly filmed the sixth installment of the Hollywood action movie at a cinema in Walsall, West Midlands, on its UK release date and illegally uploaded it on the internet, costing Universal Pictures an estimated £2.3million. Fraud investigators quickly traced him after they noticed his online ‘Thecod3r’ tag attached to the video was identical to his profile on dating site Plenty of Fish. Philip Danks, 25, bragged on Facebook he was the first person to pirate a copy of the Fast and Furious 6 movie . He was arrested by police after a special ‘webwatch’ team was set up by LA-based Universal Pictures, who raided his home in Bloxwich, Walsall on May 23 – less than a week after the video surfaced online. Danks even took to Facebook two days later to brag: ‘Seven billion people and I was the first. F*** you Universal Pictures.’ And while on police bail, he continued to sell dozens of illegal films – including the Fast and Furious 6 – for £1.50 each. He pleaded guilty to three charges of distributing pirate copies of films and was jailed for 33 months at Wolverhampton Crown Court yesterday. The court heard he made £1,000 from selling copies of the film but his dealings cost Universal Pictures an estimated £2.3million after 779,000 people were able to download it for free. Sentencing Recorder Keith Raynor said: ‘This was bold, arrogant and cocksure offending. ‘You approach to the film industry was made clear in the posting you made on Facebook two days after your arrest. ‘I accept the personal profit was modest but the real seriousness of this case is the loss caused to the film industry as a whole.’ Ari Alibhai, prosecuting on behalf of the Federation Against Copyright Theft, said Danks had recorded the film at a Showcase Cinema in Walsall on May 17, 2013. He then uploaded it onto the internet via his personal website Bit Buddy the following day after converting the pirated camcorder version into a digital copy. Danks (pictured with a sports car similar to those in the film) was caught after investigators found he had used his tag name 'thecod3r' on dating site Plenty of Fish, which listed his real details, and they raided his home . Mr Alibhaid said: ‘The film was Universal Picture's most significant release of that year with both the biggest production costs and expected revenue. ‘The estimated loss to the industry caused by the defendant's actions is conservatively estimated at £2.3m but he did not receive money from the on line distribution.’ The court heard that despite making some money from sales of the film on Facebook and by personal delivery his real motive was ‘street cred’. He added: ‘The first person with a pirated version attracts much kudos. ‘He wanted recognition from the community.’ Danks, who has given lessons on computer programming on YouTube, had to watch the film twice at the cinema on the same day because the camcorder battery ran out on the first visit. He used his Facebook page to brag just two days after his arrest saying that he was the first to pirate the movie - and was still openly posting comments on social media about his conviction up until last month (above) Danks advertised his services through his Facebook page, selling illegal movies individually or in bundles and is said to have made £1,000 from the Fast and Furious movie, costing Universal Pictures an estimated £2.3million . His copy had been picked up by ExtraTorrent – one of the world’s largest pirate film sites – and it was spotted by Universal’s webwatch team. Investigators put his distinctive 'tag' into an internet search engine and discovered he had also used it on Plenty of Fish where his proper name and age were also recorded. In his dating profile he describes himself as ‘smokes often with average body type’ and says his personality is a ‘techie’. He also says he is 5ft 10, non-religious and works as a member of bar staff and his longest relationship was less than a year. He was found by investigators on dating site Plenty of Fish where he described himself as a non-smoker of average build, with a 'techie' personality and having worked as a member of bar staff . He uploaded pictures to the site including him singing karaoke with a friend (left) and holding a baby (right) Denks (pictured with orange hair) playing a poker tournament - another one of the pictures on his dating profile . It states: ‘I like to go fishing and play poker when I can. I drive, I work (most of the time). I like listening to R&B, Garage, Bassline, Pop and anything in-between. I like watching comedies and romance films mainly but will watch pretty much anything.’ His computer and three rack servers - needed to download films faster - were seized and taken away for analysis when police raided his home. Mr Christopher Loach, defending, said: ‘He has no real qualifications and is not a man of means. Philip Danks home in Livingstone Road, Bloxwich, Walsall, which was raided by police after they were able to trace him to the address from his dating profile Plenty Of Fish. He had used the same tag 'thecod3r' on both . Showcase Cinema in Walsall where Danks secretly filmed the film before uploading it to his website Bit Buddy . Danks had to visit twice on the same day after the camera he was using ran out of battery the first time round . ‘He has no substantial assets of any sort and his financial gain has been extremely limited but he was obviously aware that it was a popular film that would be of interest.’ A second version of his copy was also uploaded onto the internet under his direction by a friend, Michael Bell. Bell, from Aldridge, West Midlands, pleaded guilty to one offence of distributing a pirate copy of a film and was given a 12 month community order with 120 hours unpaid work . Danks kept people posted on the case through Facebook - where he is seen pictured with fast sport cars similar to those in the film, which starred Paul Walker and Vin Diesel. Scenes in the Fast and Furious 6, starring Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, were filmed on the streets of Glasgow . On the day before the hearing he posted: ‘Going to try and get some sleep now, 2 important events tomorrow! 1 is to determine my fate and find out if I am going to prison, the other (if court goes well) will be playing in the biggest tournament of my life, a $700 & hopefully a $2100 tournament to fight for a spot in the EPT 11 London Main Event on October 8th! #Nervous’. Makers of the Fast & Furious 6, Universal Pictures, say his actions cos them £2.3million after he filmed the movie on its opening day in UK cinemas . But while awaiting sentence, he conceded in another post: ‘Not loking (sic) good’. After the case Kieron Sharp, director general of FACT said: ‘Thousands of people are employed making some of the world's most famous and popular films. ‘Their livelihoods are at risk if a film is unable to create the profits needed to fund future films. ‘This is an important case and an important sentence. ‘Danks was responsible for recording, uploading and distributing the film and was clearly unconcerned at the time about the consequences of his actions, perhaps believing that the internet gave him anonymity.’ Chris Marcich form the The Motion Picture Association of America said: ‘Online copyright infringement represents a significant threat to the continued success of the UK's creative industries and to the continued development of legal sources of film and TV content. ‘It is important that those making money on the back of other people's hard work and creativity, paying nothing back into the creative economy, are held accountable.’ Detective Sergeant Rod Rose, from West Midlands Police's Economic Crime Unit, added: ‘Fraud comes in many guises and ultimately affects all of us. ‘There are lots of agencies involved in stopping offenders and when they identify potential criminal offences we will always try to offer our support.’","Philip Danks, 25, secretly filmed movie at cinema and put it online for free .

"The Slender Man stabbing victim is back at school, doing well and enjoying life despite her horrific ordeal barely one year ago. Speaking to Daily Mail Online family spokesman, Steve Lyons, has shared details of Payton Leutner’s remarkable recovery and revealed how her parents have sat through every minute of the preliminary court hearing currently under way to determine whether or not their daughter’s assailants will face trial as adults. He said: ‘Payton’s mother and father have been attending court. They’re doing so because they felt they need to to move forward. ‘As difficult as it is to hear these horrific acts, they’ve worked so closely with the District Attorney that there’s very little they weren’t aware of. To hear it and see it at the proceedings is horrific but it’s helping them with the healing process.’ SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Smiling again: Payton Leutner is working hard at school and enjoyed celebrating her 13th birthday despite being stabbed repeatedly by the girls she thought were her best friends . Birthday girl: Payron celebrated her 13th birthday with a visit to a cat shelter . He continued, ‘Payton is doing very well at school. She’s working hard and enjoying her studies. Physically her wounds have healed and she’s strong. Emotionally it’s going to be a lifelong process and they’re taking it one day at a time.’ It is almost a year since Payton Leutner, then 12, was lured into woods near her home in Waukesha, Wisconsin in late May and brutally stabbed 19 times by friends hoping to win the approval of sinister fictional character, the Slender Man. Just one day earlier Payton had excitedly gone to a sleep-over with Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier, both 12 at the time of the attack, unaware of what police have described as the five month plan concocted by her best friends intent on murdering her. The slumber party was to celebrate Geyser’s twelfth birthday. Stabbed in the chest, abdomen and arms, doctors later stated that the knife allegedly wielded by Morgan Geyser passed less than a millimetre from a major artery, leaving Payton ‘the width of a human hair’ away from death. She was found by a cyclist having crawled to the edge of the wood in which her friends had left her to bleed to death. Parents: Joe and Stacey Leutner have been at court to see what will happen next to the two girls accused of their daughter's attempted murder . June court appearance: Morgan Geyser was led into a Wisconsin court room in shackles in June where she was arraigned for the attempted murder of her friend . Accused: Morgan Geyser, 12, (left), and Anissa Weier, 13, (right), face a collective 60 years in prison if tried as adults and found guilty . Checklist: This hand written note from Morgan Geyser's sketchbook shows a list of 'supplies necessary' before she and Anissa Weier stabbed their friend, Payton Leutner, in the woods last year. Noticeable is the reminder to bring a 'kitchen knife', a 'map of forest' and 'the will to live' This week her parents Stacie and Joe Leutner have relived something of that horror in court each day as a judge decides whether Geyser and Weier will face murder in the first degree as adults – a charge which carries a possible penalty of 60 years in jail. According to Mr Lyons, speaking for the couple, ‘They have faith that justice will prevail. They have worked so closely with the DA but they haven’t commented on whether they believe the girls should be tried as adults.’ Yesterday they heard how Geyser – a girl whom they had welcomed into their home as their daughter’s best friend – filled sketchbooks with grotesque and violent cartoons. Page after page of the books, seen by the court, revealed images including a young cat-like girl armed with a scythe standing over a dead girl with a speech bubble that says, ‘I love killing people.’ Elsewhere the 12-year-old wrote of her admiration of the Slender Man, whom she allegedly sincerely believed to live in a mythical Mansion in the woods. As well as the disturbing sketches the court saw Geyser’s mutilated Barbie doll and a list of ‘supplies necessary’ for the crime which included a map of the forest and ‘weapons (kitchen knife).’ Payton was stabbed with a five inch blade. They also heard psychologist Deborah Collins who has interviewed Geyser several times, give testimony that the girl appeared to genuinely believe in the existence of the macabre Slender Man. She allegedly believed that he would kill her family if she did not kill Payton. Eerie and prescient sketches: This is one of Morgan Geyser's sketches. The 12-year-old is one of two girls accused of stabbing her friend Payton Leutner and leaving her in the woods in May 2014. In this frightening picture a girl who appears to be a cat-like and armed with a scythe stands over a dead girl while saying 'I love killing people' According to Ms Collins, ‘[Her belief] hasn’t wavered and it’s been unyielding to a rational perspective.’ Questioned by Geyser’s attorney, Antony Cotton, who is forwarding the argument that she is not mentally competent to stand trial as an adult, Ms Collins also told the court that Geyser claimed to use Vulcan mind control to fight depression and that Harry Potter villain Lord Voldermort visited her. Mr and Mrs Leutner have not, Mr Lyons disclosed, spoken with Payton about the court proceedings. He said: ‘I don’t think they discuss it with her. If there’s anything she wants to discuss they will talk about it but their focus is on their little girl. ‘They are an amazing mid-Western family with mid-Western values. They feel that if they let what Payton’s assailants did to her dictate their future it will eat them up. ‘Their focus is purely on getting Payton better emotionally.’ Family: In a picture posted on their official website, Payton's parents show the girl enjoying crafts at home . As she was: Payton pictured before she came within a 'hair's breadth' of death when she was stabbed by the two girls who had invited her for a sleepover, in pictures posted by her family to mark her 13th birthday . And according to Mr Lyons, though that is a long and difficult road, Payton’s recovery – both physical and mental – is nothing short of remarkable. On Friday the girl who came a whisper from death celebrated her thirteenth birthday. Mr Lyons said, ‘She loves animals and so she went to her favourite animal shelter and hung out there. She’s a huge cat lover so she had a wonderful, fun day. ‘She really is an amazing young lady.’ Immediately after her attack Payton’s family established Hearts for Healing, a fund with a target of $250,000 to foot her medical bills. They also asked people to send hearts in purple fabric (her favourite color) with the aim of covering the walls of her bedroom with the symbols of support. They have been, Mr Lyons said, overwhelmed with gratitude at the outpouring of generosity with which their appeal was met. He said ‘The one thing they have shared with me again and again is their gratitude for all the people around the world that have been so gracious and loving with their prayers and their gifts for this amazing little girl.’ The judge is expected to reach his verdict by early March. Unnerving: The Slender Man with one of his 'chosen victims' as depicted in a popular online meme . The Slender Man is a fictional character prevalent on the internet after originating as a meme in 2009. The mythical creature is often depicted as an unnaturally tall, thin figure with a blank, featureless face, wearing a black suit. The character is said to have long, tentacle-like arms, which can be extended to capture prey. It is said to stalk, abduct and traumatize children and, depending on interpretations of the myth, can cause memory loss, insomnia and paranoia. It is also said to be able to create distortions in photographs and teleport. It is understood to have originated in a Photoshop contest on the Something Awful Forums in 2009. It then went viral with numerous works of fan art and short scary stories published online known as 'creepypasta'. The character has developed its own life online, with two feature-length films funded in part by Kickstarter appearing in 2012. The meme that appears most is that of a tall malevolent figure, who silently stalks down his prey.","Payton Leutner came close to death when she was stabbed 19 times by her two 12-year-old friends who had invited her to a sleepover .

"Wales defence coach Shaun Edwards has claimed his players are the best in the world at competing for turnovers. The former rugby league star, whose side beat Scotland on Sunday, believes the likes of Sam Warburton and Jonathan Davies are more potent at the breakdown than Richie McCaw’s All Blacks. The tackle area is a fundamental part of Test rugby and Edwards was full of praise for his side’s efforts after their victory at Murrayfield. ‘I was very impressed with our post-tackle work,’ said Edwards. ‘We turned them over six or seven times and it’s something we excel at. I think we are the most proficient side in the world at turning teams over on the floor.’ Wales defence coach Shaun Edwards (left) believes they are best in the world at turnovers . Edwards believes Sam Warburton (left) and Jonathan Davies (right) are better than likes of Richie McCaw . Edwards’ claims may seem punchy, however Wales have topped the turnover statistics in their recent Tests against England, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia. Much of the breakdown work comes down to the referee’s interpretation and Wales got on the right side of New Zealand official Glen Jackson in Edinburgh. ‘The best part of our game was Dan Biggar, Jamie Roberts and Leigh Halfpenny being fearless and leaping in the air,’ said Edwards. ‘Dan Biggar has got such guts. He is fearless.’ Biggar is Wales’s first-choice No 10, with Gareth Anscombe and Rhys Priestland his main rivals. There have been strong calls for the inclusion of Leicester’s Owen Williams ahead of the World Cup but the 22-year-old was yesterday ruled out for nine months after knee surgery. ‘It’s massively disappointing news for Owen,’ said Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill.

"It may sound like something from a science fiction film, but scientists say they have created 'zombie cells' - that continue to work after they are dead. But unlike the walking dead of Hollywood, these cells actually perform some functions better than when they were alive. Scientists say by coating organic cells in silicic acid they are able to withstand far greater temperatures and pressures than flesh. The cells are coated in silicic acid and it 'embalms' the living cell and can survive greater temperatures than flesh . The technique means scientists can preserve valuable biological material by 'converting it into a fossil.' The process was developed by researchers from Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque and the University of New Mexico. Scientists used silicic acid to 'embalm' the mammalian cells and create a near-perfect replica of its structure. They believe the zombie cells could be . used in commercial manufacturing, including fuel cells or sensor . technology and may be the future of nanotechnology. 'It's very challenging for . researchers to build structures at a nanometer scale. We can make . particles and wires, but 3-D arbitrary structures haven't been achieved . yet,' lead researcher Bryan Kaehr was quoted as saying in The Huffington . Post. He added: 'With this technique, we don't need to build those structures - nature does it for us.' The process was developed by researchers from Sandia National Laboratories and University of New Mexico . Silica has been known for its hard properties since ancient times and is found in sand and quartz. The living cells are painted with the . acid in a petri dish and the silica solution then forms a replica down . to the most minute detail. By being able to survive extreme . pressures and temperatures, the zombie cells can 'perform some functions . better than when they were alive', says Michael Hess at the American . Office of Public Affairs. He said by heating the silica to 400C, . the organic part of the cell is evaporated and the solution is kept as a . 'three-dimensional Madame Tussauds wax replica of a formerly living . being.' Mr Kaehr said the process means the cells can carry on 'working' even after they are dead. He said: 'King Tut was mummified to . approximately resemble his living self, but the process took place . without mineralisation [a process of fossilisation].

"For most of his special day, His Royal Highness Prince George Alexander Louis of Cambridge viewed proceedings with a kind of calm approval. Those present expressed relief – and surprise – he remained serene. It was too much to dare to hope the future king would bless them with a smile. But when the christening was over, when the group photographs were done, his mother cradled him inches from her adoring face for his official portrait and it was then that three-month-old George, saving the best until last, returned her gaze with a beam, then a little burst of giggles. Adorable: Prince George beams at Kate as their eyes meet, and William looks on proudly . Unity: For the first time in more than 100 years four generations of the Royal Family gathered for the christening . Family: Celebrity photographer Jason Bell was called upon to capture these stunning images from Prince George's christening . Completing the charming image, a quietly composed Prince William looked down proudly upon his son’s smiling face. In the picture, taken in the Morning Room of Clarence House, William leans against Kate, unsmiling but protective, forcing the eye to focus first on the joyous expressions of his wife and child. By far the most intimate of the christening portraits, it also exemplifies the bond between mother and child in a way that is rare for official Royal photographs, which can often seem stilted. Heir: The Queen posed with three generations of male heirs in the Morning Room of Clarence House . It is in marked contrast, for instance, to a picture taken the same day of  the Windsor and Middleton dynasties grouped around a Chippendale sofa. For Kate, her son’s exemplary behaviour at his baptism on Wednesday was an unexpected joy. Speaking at a Kensington Palace State Apartments reception and dinner on Friday night, she told a guest: ‘He’s not always like that but I think he enjoys all the different people and I think there was lots of action going on. He gets slightly distracted. ‘He was such a good boy – actually we’re very lucky.’ The relaxed tone for the christening was set from the off when, as he  carried George into the chapel at  St James’s Palace, William quipped: ‘Perfect timing. He’s just gone quiet.’ And so he remained. There was the tiniest suggestion of  a regal wave at one point and later a frown, but for the most part George appeared surprisingly peaceful. This was the baby whose father had warned has a ‘voice to match any lion’s roar’. It made life easier for 44-year-old celebrity photographer Jason Bell. Normally Bell doesn’t have to worry about eliciting a smile from his subjects – he has previously worked with Scarlett Johansson, Kate Winslet and David Beckham. But with George, his most high-profile commission to date, he had his work cut out. Until, that is, the Duchess of Cambridge stepped in with her own winning smile. For the first time in more than 100 years, four generations of the Royal Family were gathered for the christening. And Bell captured the Queen with her three male heirs, posing formally. It echoes an 1894 image from the future Edward VIII’s christening, showing him with his father, grandfather and great-grandmother – George V, Edward VII and Queen Victoria. Calm: The Prince behaved throughout his christening and was described as an 'amazing gift' by the Archbishop of Canterbury . Low-key: The christening, at the Chapel Royal in St James's Palace on Wednesday, was attended by just five senior Royals: the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall and Prince Harry . Earlier the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby told the parents and godparents that they had a  ‘simple task’ – to ‘make sure he knows who this Jesus is’. The Duchess carried her newly christened son out of the chapel after the ceremony, and the guests then left for tea hosted by the Prince of Wales at Clarence House. Attending a reception at Buckingham Palace after the event, the Queen told guests how much she had enjoyed the ceremony. ‘It was very nice though, wasn’t it?’ she told the Bishop of London, the Right Reverend Richard Chartres. The Duke and Duchess surprised many by choosing seven godparents for Prince George, with Zara Tindall, Princess Anne’s daughter, the only Royal among them. Auntie: Supporting her sister during the ceremony was Pippa Middleton, pictured leaving Kensington Palace after the celebrations ended . Keepsake: However her £7,000 gift for George, a solid silver copy of his hands and feet, has raised eyebrows . By tradition, members of the Royal Family have six godparents, but the couple opted for one more so that they could accommodate a broad mix of aristocrats, family, and school and university friends. The Duke, whose late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, is never far from his thoughts, also included one of her close friends, Julia Samuel. The godparents were among just 22 guests at the ceremony. Meanwhile yesterday, speaking ahead of a dinner to mark the Football Association’s 150th anniversary, Prince William said he will be taking Prince George to see his favourite team, Aston Villa. ‘When Villa thrash Manchester United at Villa Park, my son will be there!’ he said.","Image was the last one taken after the christening had finished .

"It was a scout at Derby County and a former tennis coach who were among the first people to notice Jonathan Joseph’s dazzling footwork. His dribbling skills and his speed between the tramlines suggested the new prince of Twickenham could have been equally at home at Wembley or Wimbledon. ‘So long as there was light, Jonathan would be out in the garden with a rugby ball, tennis ball or a football,’ said his father Ivan, who played at outside centre for Northampton between 1982 and 1986. ‘He was one of those kids who could turn his hand to any sport, although there were a few broken windows along the way!’ Jonathan Joseph scored two tries in England's RBS 6 Nations win against Italy . The 23-year-old has been recalled to England's set up after impressing for Bath . As a schoolboy in Derbyshire, Joseph’s first passion was tennis. He was offered funding to join the national futures scheme and his mentor, Ashley Broomhead, spotted footwork he believes was superior to a young Andy Murray. ‘Jon would be running lengths of a hard court and he had the ability to slide like Novak Djokovic or Roger Federer,’ said Broomhead. ‘I knew Andy Murray when he was 12 and Jon was the better athlete of the two.’ Joseph’s introduction to rugby came when his father went to pick up his car from Derby Rugby Club on a Sunday morning and discovered an Under 9s team. They went along to training the following week and Ivan began to coach alongside Roxy Fearon and Frank Toman, who was also in charge of Allestree Juniors football club. ‘He took to rugby like a duck to water,’ said Joseph Snr. ‘He was a winger in football on Saturdays and fly-half in rugby on Sundays. With football, Frank always said JJ played better when I was on the touchline. There were occasions when he was a bit lazy unless I gave him a verbal kick up the backside.’ In his early teens, Joseph was offered a place at the Pride Park academy before the family relocated from Derby to Newbury for his father’s work commitments. His younger sister, Hannah, played age-group netball for England, while Jonathan eventually joined the London Irish development team. Joseph, pictured with his sister, was a fine tennis player during his early years . A young Joseph pictured playing for Newbury Under 15s at a rugby tournament in Cork, Ireland . Football and rugby took a back seat while Joseph completed GCSEs at Park House School, where the mother of England’s Tom Croft taught IT. He also studied dance, becoming a grade A student. ‘The dance helped him with his rugby,’ said Joseph Snr. ‘Even though he managed to get it all choreographed by a friend who became a professional performer!’ A lack of confidence spotted by both Broomhead and Joseph Snr prompted the family to decide that a private sixth-form education at Millfield School would be best for his sporting talents. He continued to work closely with London Irish youth coach Justin Bishop amid the realisation that if he was not offered an academy contract he would need a full-time job or to go to university. ‘To start with he wasn’t mentally tough,’ said Bishop. ‘He wasn’t the guy who put his head where it hurts when it was cold or raining. If the lads didn’t perform they would empty the kit out of the freight container, clean it with a toothbrush, and then load it back up. JJ was quite scrawny with a swagger and arrogance that I quite liked. ‘Himself, Marland Yarde and the Watson brothers (Marcus and Anthony) would turn up with their baseball caps on back to front.’ Joseph shared an academy house with Marcus Watson and they were subjected to military-style inspections to ensure cleanliness and discipline. Strict rules were in place after Delon Armitage, a previous academy member, set fire to his billets. Joseph (2nd right) poses for a picture with his two brothers Alex and Will, sister Hannah and girlfriend Eloise . Joseph shared an academy house with England Sevens star Marcus Watson . ‘We eventually had to split Marcus and JJ up,’ said Bishop. ‘They were good friends but they were both quite laid-back and it was always a case of, “We’ll be there in five minutes, don’t worry”. We had to sit him down and say, “What do you want to do, JJ? Do you want to excel?” We were quite strict with the houses, especially after the incident with Delon! ‘They left some fat in the frying pan and, at training, Delon looked up and said, “That’s our house — it’s on fire!” ’ Joseph eventually settled down and, as well as England age-group honours, went on to break into the senior set-up with London Irish. The footwork spotted by dance teachers began to catch the eye again. ‘If you had to single out one outstanding attribute it was his feet,’ said Bishop. ‘He could double step you and you wouldn’t know which way he was going to go. He also had enormous fingers — we used to call him ET Hands because he could grip the ball in one hand.’ He won six England caps in 2012 and 2013 before he was lured to Bath but his progress slowed and he had to wait almost 20 months before he was recalled for this year’s RBS 6 Nations. ‘Parts of his first season at Bath were mediocre,’ said Joseph Snr. ‘I said, “It looks like six caps are your lot, then?” He said to me, “Dad, it’s all about timing”. With a World Cup coming up maybe he knew what he was talking about.’","Jonathan Joseph's first passion was tennis before focusing on rugby .

"Pop star Lady Gaga visited WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange  in the Ecuadorean embassy as nine people who acted as his bail sureties were ordered to hand over a total of £93,500. The singer emerged just after midnight yesterday after spending five hours in Assange's refuge in west London. She had arrived at 7pm and it's believed she had dinner with the 41-year-old. Assange has been staying in the embassy in Knightsbridge since June after going there to avoid extradition to Sweden to face questioning over allegations of rape and sexual assault made by two women. Scroll down for video . Meeting: Lady Gaga poses with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorean embassy during her late-night visit . Helping hand: Lady Gaga leaves the Ecuadorean Embassy at midnight, having spent five hours inside visiting Julian Assange . He fears that if he is extradited to . Sweden, he will be sent to the U.S. to face interrogation over the . whistle-blowing website, which has published secret military files and . diplomatic cables. Assange has been granted political asylum by Ecuador but faces arrest if he leaves the embassy after breaking bail conditions. Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle has ruled Assange's nine backers have to pay the cash by November 6. Vaughan Smith, a friend who is one of . the sureties, addressed Westminster Magistrates’ Court last week on . behalf of the nine, who put up £140,000 between them. He said all those who offered sureties of varying amounts are ‘convinced that they have done and are doing the right thing’. At the court yesterday, the Chief Magistrate said he accepted that they had all acted in good faith. ‘I accept that they trusted Mr Assange . to surrender himself as required,’ he said. ‘However, they failed in . their basic duty, to ensure his surrender. They must have understood the . risk and the concerns of the courts.’ He ruled that each of the sureties had . to pay part of the sum originally pledged, as follows: retired . professor Tricia David £10,000, Lady Evans (the literary agent Caroline . Michel) £15,000, Joseph Farrell £3,500, Sarah Harrison £3,500 and journalist Phillip Knightley £15,000. Also having to pay money were Sarah Saunders £12,000, journalist . Vaughan Smith £12,000, Nobel prize-winning biologist Sir John Sulston . £15,000, and the Marchioness of Worcester (the former actress Tracy . Ward) £7,500. It was revealed last week that the police bill for staking out the Ecuadorian embassy has reached more than £1million. Scotland Yard confirmed it is costing . £11,000 every day to ensure the Australian does not flee his bolthole at . the Ecuadorean Embassy. The final bill will be much more as Assange continues to defy extradition to Sweden. Officers have been watching the . property in Knightsbridge, west London, since Assange breached his . bail and claimed asylum in June. They have been told to arrest him if he . puts 'one toe' outside. Ecuadorean foreign minister Ricardo . Pinto has warned Mr Assange he could be in the embassy for a decade if . he is not allowed to leave Britain. Queen Of Pop pops round: Lady Gaga arrived had dinner with Assange before leaving just after midnight . WikiLeaks founder: Julian Assange has been in Ecuador's London embassy since June as part of his bid to avoid extradition to Sweden . Critics have called on the Metropolitan Police to end the costly stakeout. Last week, Foreign Secretary William . Hague admitted there is 'no sign of any breakthrough' after meeting Mr . Pinto at the United Nations in New York. The comments came after the hacking . activist accused the U.S. of persecuting WikiLeaks and torturing Bradley . Manning, the soldier accused of leaking classified documents. At least four Met officers guard the . embassy, on the second floor of a block of flats behind Harrods in . Knightsbridge, west London, around the clock. They have set up a £250,000 mobile . command station on the doorstep of the building and occupy positions . outside and in surrounding properties. Officers from every London borough, . specialist police units and undercover squads have been brought in to . join the open-ended stakeout. One colleague said: 'The officers are being moved around every three or four days to stop the boredom setting in. 'There are certainly plenty of other things these officers could be doing than standing there around the clock.' Holed up: The Ecuadorean Embassy in London where WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been staying since June 19 . Involved: Vaughan Smith (left), a friend who is one of the sureties, addressed a court last week on behalf of the nine. The Marchioness of Worcester (right), the former actress Tracy Ward, was also a backer . London Mayor Boris Johnson confirmed the policing bill between June 20 and September 10 was £905,000. If the costs continued at the average of £11,000 a day the total would now be over £1.1million. Critics called on the Met to end the stand-off but sources said the force cannot step back from its responsibilities to arrest Mr Assange for breaching his bail. Jenny Jones, a Green politician in the capital who sits on a committee that oversees the Met’s work, called for the officers to go back on the beat. She said: ‘It is ridiculous at a time when the Met is stretched as never before that so many officers are waiting around the Ecuadorean Embassy for Assange to attempt an escape.’ Lib Dem Caroline Pidgeon, who also sits on the London Assembly, added: ‘For 100 days Assange has been evading an arrest warrant for the alleged offence of rape and trying to escape the fair judicial process of Sweden. ‘At a time when police counters are closing across London his actions are a gross waste of valuable resources.’ VIDEO: Lady Gaga leaves the embassy after her visit...

"Manchester City signed Wilfried Bony hoping he can help fire them towards Premier League and Champions League glory, but it could have turned out very differently for the striker. The £28million January signing from Swansea has been a sensation since arriving in the Premier League in 2013, but the Ivory Coast international's career could have easily been based on preventing goals rather than scoring them. The 26-year-old revealed in a Google chat with Manchester City supporters that he in fact used to be a defender, a centre-half no less, as he admitted that legendary Brazil striker Ronaldo was his biggest inspiration growing up. Wilfried Bony took questions from Manchester City fans on Google ahead of his potential debut for the club . Ronaldo celebrates scoring against Germany in the 2002 World Cup final, with the former Brazil striker an inspiration to Wilfried Bony in converting from a defender to a striker . 'Ronaldo from Brazil,' Bony told fans about his childhood inspiration. 'Because I was a defender, then I loved him because he had everything. He was a complex player and I just think I wanted to be a striker and I am now, he gave me motivation to be a striker. As well as revealing how he changed positions in his youth, Bony also confirmed that new Manchester City and Ivory Coast team-mate Yaya Toure played a big part in helping him join the Premier League champions, and that he hopes to secure a trophy double this term. 'Always [in contact]. Even before they [City] ask for me we were in constant contact. Toure is a good guy,' Bony continued. Bony revealed Ivory Coast team-mate and Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure helped him join the club .

We need supporters to support us. We will do our best on the pitch and play to our strengths.

"Nevada Assemblywoman Michele Fiore has drawn criticism over a comment about concealed weapon permits. The Las Vegas Republican came under fire from Assembly leaders and women's groups after she was quoted in the New York Times as saying 'hot little girls' need concealed weapons to defend themselves from rapists. 'If these young, hot little girls on campus have a firearm, I wonder how many men will want to assault them,' Fiore told the newspaper. ' Speaking her mind: Assembly woman Michele Fiore, a conservative Las Vegas Republican, talked about her bill that would allow people with concealed weapons permits to carry firearms on Nevada campuses . Firey: Fiore is the main sponsor of a bill introduced last week that would allow people with concealed weapons permits to take their firearms onto the state's college campuses . Blunt: Fiore said assaults would decrease once sexual predators got bullets in their heads . 'The sexual assaults that are occurring would go down once these sexual predators get a bullet in their head.' The Nevada Women's Lobby and Democratic Assembly Minority Leader Marilyn Kirkpatrick issued statements against Fiore's comments, calling them unrepresentative of rape victims and objectifying of women. Fiore didn't back down from her statement and said on her website that the quote was not the most 'eloquent' but she still stood by the sentiment behind it. 'That may not be the most eloquent way to phrase it,' she acknowledged in a statement released on Wednesday afternoon. 'However, I stand wholeheartedly by that sentiment because I want every citizen, whether they're on a college campus or not, to have the right to defend him or herself from sexual assault.' Different approach: Gun control advocates have linked the push to allow concealed carry based on a sexual assault prevention justification with the firearms industry's recent attempts to appeal more broadly to women . Outspoken: Ms. Fiore of Nevada, predicts the Republican-controlled Nevada Legislature and Republican governor would enact her bill which will allow guns to be carried on campus . Fiore is a fierce supporter of gun rights who has referred to herself as a 'conservative, Catholic, gun-toting, second amendment, strong-ass woman' and as 'someone that carries a firearm on me like my panties and bra.' She has acknowledged that she carries her firearm even in gun-free zones. Gun enthusiasts recently attempted to capitalize on the recent attention over the numbers of sexual assaults on college campuses to push their agenda. The gun lobby is increasingly trying to appeal to women and one of the ways they have been doing so recently is by telling women to take steps to prevent their own rapes. 'The gun lobby has seized on this tactic, this subject of sexual assault. It resonates with lawmakers,' Andy Pelosi, the executive director of the Campaign to Keep Guns Off Campus, told the New York Times in the same article that included Fiore's comments. University presidents, college students, and domestic violence experts are all opposed to the idea of allowing concealed weapons on school grounds.","Calls for Michele Fiore to apologize for comments she made  about rape, concealed weapons and women on college campuses .

"Sunderland striker Danny Graham is refusing to hide as he attempts to end his goal drought. The 29-year-old frontman is yet to open his account in 20 appearances for the club, but has forced his way back into contention in recent weeks and is desperate to address that situation. Graham told the Sunderland Echo: 'It would be massive [to get that first goal]. Obviously, as a striker you want to be scoring goals and doing well for your football club, but that's not been the case so far for me. Danny Graham is desperate to end his goal drought at Sunderland now he is back in the first-team picture . Graham (left) was part of the Sunderland side that lost 2-0 to League One Bradford City in the FA Cup . 'I know that, I'm not going to hide. It's up to me to work hard and make sure I get in the positions and not shy away from an opportunity when it comes my way. 'Once one goes in, I'm sure a lot more will follow. The first goal would be nice, but the most important thing is the team - we need to pick up points and make sure we're not going to struggle come the end of the season.' Former Middlesbrough trainee Graham arrived at the Stadium of Light in a £5million switch from Swansea in January 2013 under then-manager Martin O'Neill, but having failed to find the back of the net in 13 appearances at the end of that campaign, during which the Northern Irish boss was relieved of his duties, he became surplus to requirements. The former Swansea striker's £5million move hasn't worked out so far, with no goals to show . Indeed, he spent the whole of last season on loan, initially at Hull and then Boro, and joined Wolves on a similar basis for two months earlier in the current campaign. However, his return in January and the subsequent arrival of Jermain Defoe have given him a new lease of life on Wearside, and he is relishing the prospect of competing with Steven Fletcher and Connor Wickham to partner the England international once the newcomer shakes of a calf injury. Steven Fletcher is in direct competition with Graham for a place in Gus Poyet's starting line-up . Connor Wickham is another Sunderland striker that stands in the way of Graham's first-team hopes . Graham said: 'We're all starting from the same place. All four strikers will be playing at different times and we all bring different things to the team. 'But Jermain has given everyone around the place a lift. You can see that if he gets one chance, he will more than likely put it away and that's what we've been missing. 'To have a player of his calibre at the football club is massive and it's going to help us. Everyone wants to play up front with him and help him and the team do well.'

"Injured Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard will watch his side take on Besiktas in the final 32 of the Europa League as a pundit for ITV, and it could be a good sign for his team. Brendan Rodgers' side will undoubtedly miss Gerrard's experience in Europe but when the Liverpool midfielder was a Sky Sports pundit for his team's game against Tottenham at White Hart Lane  last season, they won 5-0. Gerrard was ruled out that day with a hamstring problem and the same injury means he will miss out on Thursday.

"Brutal regime: Guantanamo Bay interrogator Richard Zuley is accused of using brutal methods to extract confessions from suspects during 30 years as a Chicago detective . A Guantanamo Bay interrogator responsible for implementing brutal methods at the prison allegedly used similar tactics to extract murder confessions from non-white citizens during his 30-year spell as a Chicago detective. Richard Zuley is accused of shackling suspects to police precinct walls for hours on end, threatening to harm their families and pressurizing them into implicating themselves and others. Apparently targeting minority Americans, the detective's brutal regime resulted in at least one wrongful conviction - and other cases being thrown into doubt following accusations of abuse. The shocking details, uncovered in an investigation by the Guardian, further damage the reputation of a country still reeling from recent revelations of wartime torture by the CIA. Zuley was a detective on Chicago's north side from 1977 to 2007 and allegedly spent years engaging in brutal interrogation tactics, which are said to have included threatening subjects with the death penalty if they failed to cooperate. He was also accused of planting evidence in one high-profile murder case where there was pressure to gain a speedy conviction. As a Navy reserve lieutenant, he also carried out work for the military, telling a Chicago court in the mid 1990s that he did counter-terrorism work for Naval intelligence while continuing his role as a detective. He was recruited to the Guantanamo Bay operation in 2002 - with U.S. military commanders believing he was just the man they had been searching for - having spent three decades cleaning up the streets of Chicago. He says he was sent to  Cuba as the 'liaison officer for the European Command' and was assigned to the prison's intelligence collection task force. Recruited: The Navy reserve lieutenant was recruited to the Guantanamo Bay operation in 2002 - with US military commanders believing he was just the man they had been looking for to get results . Zuley was said to have made an immediate impression on Major General Geoffrey Miller, who had been given command of Joint Task Force-Guantanamo in November 2002. The detective took charge of the interrogation of Mohamedou Ould Slahi, described in official government reports and a best-selling memoir as one of the most brutal ever conducted at the US prison. Slahi was seen as a priority interrogation target upon arriving at the wartime jail in August 2002. He was a veteran of the anti-Soviet jihad in Afghanistan, and US officials suspected he would have information on al-Qaida’s recruitment of the 9/11 hijackers in Europe. Brutally treated: Zuley took charge of the interrogation of Mohamedou Ould Slahi (above) at Guantanamo, described in official government reports as one of the most brutal ever conducted at the US prison . Stuart Couch, a former Marine lieutenant colonel and military commissions prosecutor, described Slahi's treatment as 'unconscionable'. He said: 'I've never seen anyone stoop to those levels,' Stuart Couch, a former Marine lieutenant colonel and military commissions prosecutor, said according to the Guardian. 'It's unconscionable, from a perspective of a criminal prosecution – or an interrogation, for that matter.' Memoir: Mohamedou Ould Slahi's harrowing account of his treatment as a prisoner of Guantanamo Bay . Mark Fallon, deputy commander of the now-shuttered Criminal Investigative Task Force at Guantánamo, called Zuley’s interrogation of Slahi 'illegal, immoral and ineffective'. While his methods at Guantanamo soon came to light, his shameful tactics, honed over years behind closed doors in Chicago police stations, have not received the same public scrutiny. Several people in Illinois say they were wrongly convicted of crimes following coerced confessions extracted by Zuley and his teams. An investigation into his methods and conviction records was launched following the 2013 state-attorney's decision to free an innocent man Zuley had helped send to prison for 23 years. Lathieral Boyd, who was convicted of murder in 1990, has filed a federal civil-rights lawsuit against him after spending half his life in prison. On Tuesday, papers filed in federal court showed that the conviction-integrity unit of the Cook County state's attorney now wants to look at civilian complaints against Zuley relating to another wrongful-conviction case. Another case highlighted by the Guardian includes that of Benita Johnson and Andre Griggs. Griggs was a heroin addict and petty criminal who was accused of murder in 1994 after an informant claimed he boasted about it. Griggs says he was handcuffed to a station wall for 'maybe 30 hours' - an ordeal he claims led him to sign a false confession. Allegedly coerced: Andre Griggs (L) and Benita johnson said they signed false murder confessions in 1994 after Zuley and his colleagues handcuffed them to the wall for up to 30 hours and threatened them . Murder victim: Griggs and Johnson were both convicted for the killing of Renée Rondeau . Benita Johnson says she was also handcuffed to a precinct wall and implicated herself and former boyfriend Griggs after Zuley and his colleagues threatened to take away her children and seek the death penalty. Describing her interrogation, Johnson said: 'Basically they just tortured me, mentally, and somewhat physically, with the cuffs, and screamed and hollered. I went through a lot.' Zuley received praise from Chicago mayor Richard Daley for his successful interrogation of the two suspects. So far he has not responded to the allegations. Wrongly jailed: Lathieral Boyd spent 23 years in prison as a result of the faulty police work of Zuley .","Richard Zuley was a detective in Chicago's north side from 1977 to 2007 .

"Melissa Dohme agreed to meet her ex-boyfriend outside her Clearwater, Florida, home for one final embrace. In a split second after they clinched, Robert Burton unleashed a frenzied stabbing attack on her face and body, cracking her skull, knocking out her teeth and slicing through her neck and back. The pretty college student flat-lined four times that night in January 2012, as doctor's battled to stem the flow of blood from her 32 stabs wounds. Scroll Down for Video . Shocking: Melissa Dohme, appears in a picture in the weeks after she was stabbed 32-times by her ex-boyfriend Robert Burton outside her home in Clearwater, Florida on January 24, 2012 . She suffered a stroke that rendered the left side of her face paralyzed and caused her disfigurement she has admitted was 'hard to accept'. But amazingly she survived against all odds and as violence against women dominates the headlines, Dohme has released an image of her wounds in her role as a campaigner for victims of domestic abuse. In the two years since she desperately clambered onto the sidewalk to escape her crazed boyfriend running her over as he fled in his car, Dohme, now 22, has undergone 10 reconstructive procedures as part of her recovery. Incredibly, she has forgiven Burton, who is currently serving a life sentence without parole for his cowardly and brutal attack. Now: Melissa Dohme's recovery is apparent in this grab from her appearance on Sunday night for CBS show 48-Hours - in which she discussed her campaign against domestic violence . Close to death: Melissa nearly died four times as doctors battled to save her after she suffered 32 stab wounds and her recovery proceeded slowly .

Brutal: Police gather evidence pictures of the wounds that Robert Burton inflicted on his former girlfriend that almost ended her life . Crazed: Robert Burton is pictured here with Melissa Dohme before he unleashed his horrifying assault on her in January 2012 . Video Source YouTube . And in an incredible turn of fate, Dohme is now in a loving relationship with one of the first paramedics on the scene who responded to the 911 call. In an interview with CBS News to highlight the recent spate of violent attacks on women inlcuding the stoning death of a woman in Pakistan and the rape and hanging of two women in India, Dohme recounted the terrible evening of January 24, 2012. 'I went outside to meet Robert Burton ... in the hopes that he would really leave me alone forever,' said Dohme. 'He said that he just ... wanted a hug. It's all he wanted. ... A final goodbye, all he wanted was closure and I basically, you know, walked outside to my murder. 'And, you know, I ... walked up to him. ...He looked kind of empty, no emotion ... absolutely nothing in his eyes. Just soulless ... I mean he was just blank face. 'I heard a click ... I didn't know what the sound was, he just started just stabbing me with that knife ... he just kept coming at my face. 'I knew my face was completely covered in blood, and my hair felt soaking wet. I mean, it was seriously, like, dripping wet, like I just got outta the shower. 'I was trying to scream and I'm trying to crawl and I wasn't getting anywhere. 'I felt myself dying so ... I couldn't really breathe. .... I felt myself I really was not going to make it. I really said 'this is it.' Survivor: Melissa Dohme was stabbed in the face and neck more than 32 times, but her scars are quickly fading; the picture on the right shows how her scars have healed in a two-month span . Remarkable recovery: Melissa posted this montage of photographs that documented her recovery from a near fatal stabbing in 2012 . Dohme and Burton had been together for two years before she ended their relationship after he throttled her one evening in 2011. In her impact statement at his sentencing in March, 2013, Dohme reminded the judge exactly what Burton did to her and what he wanted to do to her. 'He was just stabbing over and over with the switch blade knife and that's when I was leaving my hands up because I knew he was trying to stab me in the eyes and heart,' she said. A trauma surgeon told the judge it was a miracle Dohme survived as she was seconds away from dying, the Tampa Bay Times reports. Found love: Melissa Dohme with her boyfriend Cameron Hill last year - who was one of the paramedics who responded to her 911 call when she was stabbed 32 times in the face and neck . Justice served: Melissa Dohme in court last year . with her mom and sister, left, and the surgeon she credits with saving . her life, right . She suffered a stroke from the blood loss and had cuts across her arms, neck, head and face. Her teeth were knocked out, and her skull was cracked. 'It is all like a blur, I remember pieces of it,' said Dohme to CBS News. 'He immediately stabbed me right here in the back of my shoulder and then right here in the back of my neck. 'The knife just kept coming down at me. 'I remember hearing ... my skull crack. Over all of my -- he kept coming at my face. 'And then my mouth filled with blood ... ""Oh, my God, you know, he's going to kill me. ... This is a fight for my life ... I have to scream. I have to run. 'I was losing blood everywhere. I kept trying to like crawl away from him... 'I was so weak ... I felt like I was going to die right there.' Burton pleaded guilty to attempted first-degree murder and domestic abuse in the stabbing of his ex-girlfriend. At her court appearance, Dohme was accompanied by her now-boyfriend, Clearwater firefighter, Cameron Hill, 39, who responded to the 911 call. Happy outcome: Cameron Hill and Melissa Dohme met for the first time that awful night - but are now together . Mr Hill said the sight of the young woman drenched in blood with stab wounds to her hands, arms, face and head was the most gruesome he had seen in his 17-year career. Though he couldn't see her face, couldn't tell if she was blond because of the blood and didn't know her name, a strange feeling came over him and he said he knew in his heart he was going to see her again. 'Usually with a person that has been stabbed that many times, you don't think that they are gonna make it ... But as the helicopter was lifting off that night, I had this crazy little feeling in my head that I would see Melissa again,' said Hill to CBS News. Melissa ended up being in the hospital for three weeks. She flat lined four times, received 12 units of blood and suffered a stroke that affected her balance, according to The Tampa Bay Times. A severed nerve partially paralyzed the left side of her face. Though doctors did not know if she would speak smile or walk again, she made a remarkable recovery and left rehab without a cane. Head over heels: Cameron did not know what to do but . could not get the young woman he rescued out of his head. He . eventually asked her out and ever since their first date the pair have . been inseparable . 'When Melissa showed up to our trauma center here in St. Petersburg, she ... was dying before our eyes. ... And without a rapid intervention it would be over quick,' said Dr. Jeffery Johnson of the Bayfront Health Medical Center. 'So the moment she hit the door we started resuscitation, we started CPR, we started replacing her blood volume. And then our next point of attack was to stop the bleeding. 'Melissa died twice in our emergency room-- and each time we were able to get back. I wasn't giving up and she wasn't giving up. And so, if she wasn't gonna give up, our team wasn't gonna give up.' She became determined to reach out to all those who helped save her and to tell her story to others. After a trip to Europe with her girlfriends, she returned determined to become a nurse. She now travels the country speaking as an advocate for abused women. 'I don't want to hear of another girl on the news who was killed or another girl who was permanently disfigured. I don't want to hear these things,' she said to CBS News. 'One of the main things I tell new girls is never meet up with an abusive ex of yours, it's not safe and I didn't know that.'","Melissa Dohme nearly died on the evening of January 24, 2012 when Robert Burton attacked her outside her home .

"Could you live on just £1 a day for a week? A supermarket chain has created a menu of recipes to help families eat on just £1 a day. Aldi has teamed up with nutritionist Angela Dowden and put together a week-long menu of 'nutritional and tasty breakfasts, lunches and dinners all for under £1', to run alongside the Live Below The Line challenge, an initiative of the Global Poverty Project. The menu includes meals such as pea soup, ham bagels, baked potatoes with mushrooms, sardine fishcakes and turkey chilli. Most recipes serve three to four people, which means singletons might struggle unless they don't mind eating the same thing for lunch and dinner, then leftovers every other day. High-profile celebrities including Ben Affleck, . Hugh Jackman and cast members from TOWIE have accepted the challenge of living . below the poverty line - spending under £1 per day on food for one whole . week - in order to raise awareness of extreme poverty across the world. With their menu, Aldi hope to inspire the nation to get behind the challenge. Angela Dowden said: 'Eating for less doesn’t have to mean existing entirely on a diet of beans, rice and pasta. 'Buying versatile ingredients helps to create a combination of tasty dishes, as well as cutting costs. Once you know how, eating for £1-a-day can be easier than you'd think.' Using ingredients that can all be bought at Aldi - though variations are available at all good food outlets - Angela has created a range of recipes 'to appeal to every palate', all for under £1.

"Nick Easter was quickly dragged down to earth after his memorable England comeback earlier this month – with a fine for failing to practise what he preaches at Wimbledon RFC. The 36-year-old Harlequins No 8 has taken on the role of first-team coach at the London & South East Division One club this season. A return to Test rugby in Cardiff – where he made his first international appearance since the 2011 World Cup – was not about to stop him being on hand to shout orders to his players the next day. After a dash back from the Welsh capital to England’s Surrey HQ, Easter made it in time to oversee a resounding home win over Havant. ‘I arrived just in time for the warm-up,’ he said. ‘We got the coach back to Pennyhill Park and I drove into the rugby club just as they were starting the warm-up. Nick Easter, pictured during an England training session, is hoping to be involved against Ireland . The 36-year-old has been gearing up for England's next RBS 6 Nations match against Ireland . ‘I don’t think they expected to see me, but the manager said it was a little bit of a lift for them for me to turn up. I was barking orders straight away! They won 45-0. ‘I really enjoy it down there. It is a good group of lads and they are willing to learn. It reminds you of what rugby is all about. None of the players are paid, obviously. There is a club house and muddy pitches that you go and coach on, on a Tuesday and Thursday. You try and get the best out of them and we are enjoying a successful year. Everyone is enjoying themselves.’ On Easter’s watch, Wimbledon are on a roll – currently top of their league table with 16 wins from 19 matches. But his positive impact didn’t stop him from facing the music, after his accidental obstruction had denied England a late try in Cardiff. ‘I got fined,’ he said. ‘We had a fining session last week and the 2nd-team coach said, “Everyone has been drilled to make sure they time their decoy runs right and make sure they’re an option”. Obviously I got penalised for that for Dave Attwood’s disallowed try in Cardiff, so I was up before the beak.’ Easter was part of the England side which lost 24-8 to Ireland at the Aviva Stadium back in March 2011 . Now that Easter has become the oldest try-scorer in RBS Six Nations history and proved to himself that he can withstand the ferocity of Test rugby at the age of 36, he has a score to settle in Dublin. Four years ago, the Harlequins No 8 was the last Englishman to lift the championship trophy – but it was a surreal ceremony in the lobby of a hotel, after Martin Johnson’s team had been beaten 24-8 by Ireland, to dash their Grand Slam hopes. Easter is back in the Red Rose ranks and he is desperate for another shot at the title-chasing Irish on March 1. ‘Hopefully, I will be involved against Ireland because there are a few wrongs to put right after 2011,’ he said. ‘Wig (Graham Rowntree, England forwards coach) was around then, as well as a few other guys – Dylan, Coley, Ben Youngs. It was a long time ago. The important thing this week is it will be a cracking game, with a big build-up, but we have two weeks’ preparation. ‘Back then – and I’m not using this as an excuse – I think we played Scotland the previous Sunday and then had six days to prepare. We just didn’t do it in 2011. It wasn’t because of the six-day turn-around, I think it's because we forgot what it takes to get a result in tough places like that. ‘But this time we have two weeks to prepare, so we can get back up to the same level we were at going to Cardiff. Training will be pretty intense.’ England's Easter, pictured driving with the ball, has said he wants to put things right after previous defeat . That intensity will suit Easter just fine. Since his recall to the England squad last month, he has felt at home as the senior player. Asked if he feels his body can cope with taking part in another World Cup, he said: ‘I’m even more convinced now. I only played 10 minutes in Cardiff and 25 against Italy. It is very different if you start a game, but I have no issues whatsoever.’ His try against Italy was his first for the national team since he touched down on November 15, 2008, against Australia. ‘It was a long time ago,’ he said. Easter has spoken of having ‘unfinished business’ in Test rugby, but admitted that the satisfaction of returning to the England fold would be tempered by poor results. So far, however, he has played a cameo role in back-to-back wins. Now he will prepare for the next trip to Dublin, full of hope and expectation. ‘It is about winning,’ he said. ‘There is no reason we shouldn’t if we get everything right, with the resources we have got and the players we have.’","Nick Easter is hoping to be involved against Ireland on March 1 .

"Micah Richards claims he had chances to move to Chelsea and Manchester United earlier in his career - but he's now loving life in Italy's Serie A with loan-club Fiorentina. The 26-year-old Manchester City youth product faces English opposition on Thursday evening in the form of Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League and has expressed regret at the way his City career seems to have ended. Richards made 236 appearances for City after breaking into the first team in 2005 but was only seen 10 times last season under Manuel Pellegrini - mostly in the domestic cup competitions - before moving to Serie A. Micah Richards trains at White Hart Lane with Fiorentina ahead of their Europa League clash with Tottenham . Richards is enjoying life in Serie A after deciding to leave City due to the lack of first-team football available . Richards (right) posted this image with his Fiorentina team-mates on the plane to London . 'If we didn’t get the investment we did (at City), I’d probably be captain now,' Richards told The Telegraph. 'I probably wouldn’t have left. I had a chance to go to Chelsea five years ago, and Manchester United but I didn’t feel it was right. 'I always enjoyed City. They gave me a chance at such a young age (17). I’ve been a bit unfortunate because whenever I picked up some form I got a niggling injury. With City, if you get an injury you can find yourself out of the team for months.' Richards celebrates scoring an FA Cup equaliser at Villa Park for City back in February 2006 . The England international was a regular for City and came up against the likes of Chelsea winger Arjen Robben . Richards, who says he has no hard feeling against Pellegrini or first-choice right back Pablo Zabaleta, still believes it will be tough for young players to get through at City despite the big investment in their £200million new training complex. 'If a manager comes in and the owner says ""we want five trophies in five years"", can he afford to risk bringing young players through when you need results?' said Richards. 'Patrick Vieira’s doing an amazing job [as City’s Elite Development Squad coach] in getting the best he possibly can out of the kids. But ultimately it is the manager’s decision whether he puts them in or not. If you’ve got Yaya Toure and Fernandinho, who do you leave out to bring a young midfielder through?' A rare first-team appearance under Manuel Pellegrini saw Richards face Wigan in City's defeat last season . Pellegrini appeared to view Richards as surplus to requirements, preferring Pablo Zabaleta and Bacary Sagna . Richards fears that it will be continue for City youngsters to break through despite the club's huge investment .","Manchester City youth product is on loan at Serie A side Fiorentina .

"For most of its working life it was most commonly seen thousands of feet in the air, transporting jet-setters to all corners of the world. But this decommissioned Boeing 747 jumbo jet ended up causing travel misery today as it crawled down the motorway behind a police escort. The front section and cockpit of the 'Queen of the Skies' made its way from Cotswold Airport in Kemble, Gloucestershire, down the A419 dual carriageway between Cirencester and Swindon. The disused plane will eventually be put back together on a site in Staffordshire to provide a studio for interior design university students.

The aircraft left the Cotswold Airport at 7am today and will head north to Cirencester, then south east heading north up the M5 through Gloucestershire. It will then be driven to Hereford, before arriving at the Staffordshire site where it will be converted into a unique studio for interior design students . Helen Keighley, director of quality and business at the academy, said the old plane had deliberately been chosen for a venue for the students to work in because it would provide a challenging and creative environment for them. She said: 'It's much cheaper than putting up a building. We are really going to prepare them for the world of work. 'They're not going to sit in a lecture theatre, they're going to be totally in the design practice. 'They will work there for 45 weeks a year and learn how to design venues.' Police warned the abnormally large loads were likely to cause considerable disruption to motorists. A spokesman for Wiltshire police said. 'Due to the size of these transporters they will be slow moving and will have the potential to create congestion. 'Wherever possible disruption will be kept to a minimum but hauliers and motorists are asked to please be patient if they come across this load. 'Anyone travelling over this period to catch a flight or meet appointments should allow sufficient additional time. 'Please be aware that once on the A419 these loads will be slow moving and take up the entire southbound carriageways. 'Regular updates and travel information in respect of this abnormal load will be passed from our control room at Devizes when appropriate to help motorists plan their journey.' The transfer of the aircraft will add to the travel misery this Valentine's Day. It comes as two major crashes, on the M40 near Bicester in Oxfordshire and the M1 near Flitwick in Bedfordshire, caused long tailbacks. The Boeing 747 is a wide-body commercial airliner and cargo transport aircraft, often referred to by its original nickname, Jumbo Jet, or Queen of the Skies. Its iconic 'hump' upper deck along the forward part of the aircraft make it among the world's most recognizable aircraft. First flown commercially in 1970, the 747 held the passenger capacity record for 37 years. The 747 is to be replaced by the Boeing Y3 (part of the Boeing Yellowstone Project) in the future.","Decommissioned Boeing 747 jumbo jet made its way from Cotswold Airport in Gloucestershire to Staffordshire .

"Candles lit up the plaza of a central Arizona courthouse yesterday as hundreds gathered to hear Eric Mueller offer a heart wrenching tribute to his sister Kayla, who died last month after being taken hostage by ISIS militants. The 26-year-old aid worker's death earlier this month was confirmed by her family and U.S. officials following her capture by the jihadis in Syria in August 2013. Before the crowd, her brother offered a poignant message to his sister when he told her: 'You can rest in peace knowing you have changed the world.' Mr Mueller encouraged those in attendance to live as his best friend and sister had, by reaching out to others who were suffering.

Friends said 26-year-old Kayla Mueller (pictured left and right) was tireless in her efforts to improve others' lives and said she represented the best of humanity . In the first public comments he has made since her death, he said: 'Only now will you be able to see how much you truly did for this world by looking down on it. You can rest in peace knowing you have changed the world,' USA Today reported. He went on to implore the crowd to help those who are struggling - a belief his sister had dedicated her life to. 'If you see someone struggling, see somebody upset, go give them a hug. It will make the community stronger. That's all it's going to do.' His father, Carl Mueller, stood up immediately after his son finished speaking and hugged him tightly at the bottom of the stage. Friends, family and strangers wore pink ribbons on their shirts as they listened to speakers reflect on her life and work. Strangers and friends dropped off cards and wrote messages for a scrapbook, calling her an angel and saying she represented the best of humanity. Miss Mueller's friends set up tables to accept canned goods and money for the needy, saying that was what she would have wanted. 'She was a saint,' said Rebecca Dunn, who attended high school with her. 'I'm hoping someone can take on her legacy. There was nothing she couldn't do.'

Churches and community groups in her hometown of Prescott, the former territorial capital of Arizona, organized the candlelight memorial. As it opened, a live band sang 'He Who Began A Good Work in You,' a song that Miss Mueller's mother, Marsha, used to sing to her as a child. Her family sat in the front row, clasping hands and wiping tears from their eyes. In the crowd, people raised their hands, closed their eyes and sang along. Pastor Ron Merrell said he was hopeful the community that gathered would give hope and love to Miss Mueller's family, and bring light into darkness - 'something that Kayla Mueller was good at.' From Prescott, she helped raise awareness of HIV and AIDS, and she volunteered for the overnight shift at a women's shelter. Her father Carl holds a candle during the ceremony.

"Millions of cricket fans will never again trust what they see on the field because of the match-fixing scandal, a judge said yesterday. Three corrupt Pakistan players were savaged for tainting cricket by taking bungs as part of a shadowy international gambling scam. The men were told they had irrevocably damaged the name of a sport which was once a byword for ‘fair dealing’. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO OF HOW THE SCAM WAS UNCOVERED . Sentence: Pakistan cricketer Mohammed Aamer arrives at Southwark Crown court, where he was jailed for six months . Jailed: Former world number two Test bowler . Mohammad Asif, left, was jailed for one year while Pakistan Test cricket . captain Salman Butt, right, was jailed for 30 months. Both are . pictured entering court . Mr Justice Cooke said former Test . captain Salman Butt and bowlers Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer . betrayed legions of fans for greed. Jailing the men at Southwark Crown . Court yesterday, he said people watching cricket will be ‘left to . wonder’ whether surprising results were genuine. Mr Justice Cooke said: ‘It is the . insidious effect of your actions on professional cricket and the . followers of it that make the offences so serious. ‘The image and integrity of what was . once a game but is now a business is damaged in the eyes of all, . including the many youngsters who regarded you as heroes and would have . given their eye teeth to play at the levels and with the skills that you . had. ‘You procured the bowling of three . no-balls for money, to the detriment of your national cricket team, with . the object of enabling others to cheat at gambling. ‘Now whenever people look back on a . surprising event in a game or a surprising result, or whenever in the . future there are surprising events or results, followers of the game . will be left to wonder whether there has been fixing and whether what . they have been watching is a genuine contest between bat and ball. What . ought to be honest sporting competition may not be such at all.’ In the dock: (left to right) Majeed, Butt, Asif, and Amir hear they are to be jailed by Justice Cooke . Struggle: Salman Butt had to fight his way through the media as he arrived at Southwark Crown Court and was given the heaviest sentence for his role in the scam . The three players were jailed . alongside agent Mazhar Majeed, who was caught orchestrating the scandal . in an undercover sting by the News of the World. Mr Justice Cooke, yesterday . They agreed to bowl three no-balls at specified points during a Lord’s Test match last August in return for £150,000. The jail sentences closed one chapter in an extraordinary scandal that has rocked the international game. But questions remain over how far the . corruption had spread and whether other Pakistan players were involved. Butt, 27, dubbed the ‘architect’ of the lucrative betting scam, was . jailed for two and a half years just two days after his wife gave birth . to a second son in Pakistan. The world’s former No 2-ranked Test . bowler Asif, 28, received a 12-month term. Aamer, 19, once tipped to . become one of the all-time great fast bowlers, was jailed for six . months. Former Croydon Athletic FC owner . Majeed, 36, who boasted he had made ‘masses and masses of money’, was . jailed for two years and eight months. Pleading his innocence: the sisters of cricketer Salman Butt talk to journalists in Lahore, Pakistan, after hearing that their brother had been jailed . Distress: Mohamma Ijaz, the brother of Mohammed Aamer, reacts as he hears the verdict at the family home in Changa Bangial village . Anger: Pakistani cricket fans gather and burnt posters depicting the three players after hearing the verdicts . He was secretly videoed counting huge sums of money and bragging that he could fix an entire Test match for a million dollars. The four defendants sat impassively in . a courtroom packed with journalists and cricket fans as they learned . their fates. They will be released on licence after serving half their . sentences and are almost certain to be deported. Butt, Asif and Majeed were sent to . Wandsworth prison in south-west London. Aamer, who is appealing his . sentence, was sent to Feltham young offenders’ institution. The judge said Butt was responsible for involving the ‘impressionable’ Aamer, then aged only 18. Cheat: Teenager Amir is shown performing one of the no-balls that were found to be pre-determined when Pakistan played England at Lord's in August 2010 . No ball: Asif deliberately oversteps the line with the last delivery of the tenth over during the test match . He said: ‘It appears that the . corruption may have been more widespread than the defendants here before . me, and may have permeated the team in earlier days. ‘If that is the case, you, as captain, . perpetuated such an atmosphere of corruption and would be responsible . for it and for the desire to use Majeed and his contacts to make money . for yourself and others in the team.’ All three players were banned from playing for five years by the International Cricket Council in February. The Pakistan Cricket Board said the conviction of the players was ‘a sad day for Pakistan cricket’.","Salman Butt jailed for 30 months for his involvement .

"She might be one of the world's longest serving heads of state but it seems that not even the Queen is exempt from getting stuck in a traffic jam. The 88-year-old monarch was en route to a reception at Canada House in London, when her official Bentley got stuck in the notoriously heavy traffic in Trafalgar Square. Luckily for the Queen, who was travelling with the Duke of Edinburgh, her driver managed to extricate the car and get her to the event on schedule. Scroll down for video . One is not amused: The Queen looks less than impressed after battling traffic en route to the event . Made it! The Queen steps out of her official car after arriving at Canada House in London . Stuck: A few moments earlier, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh had been stuck in heavy traffic . Her Majesty was visiting Canada House, the  home of the Canadian High Commission, to reopen it following extensive renovations. Resplendent in a turquoise tweed coat and a matching dress and hat, the Queen appeared none the worse for her lengthy journey and beamed broadly as she spied a pair of Mounties [Royal Canadian Mounted Police] waiting for her outside. Accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, Her Majesty was then ushered indoors, where she was presented with a ceremonial set of keys. Made from gold, silver and nickel, they are an updated version of the set presented to King George V, who opened the building shortly after it was completed in 1925. Afterwards, the Queen and Prince Philip were given a tour of the newly refurbished building and were introduced to High Commission staff. The Queen was also presented with a pair of posies by eight-year-old Alexandra Yepez and her sister Natalia, five, the daughters of Canadian Consul-General, Lisa Almond. Not impressed: Sitting in the front seat of the car, the Queen's protection officer looked glum . Big arrival: After the car was extricated from the jam, it eventually pulled up outside Canada House . None the worse: When the royal couple emerged, they looked none the worse for the experience . Of particular interest to Her Majesty was the atrium, which has been renamed in her honour and features Canadian hemlock cladding and a swathe of red oak flooring. The atrium, although the newest addition to the list, is by no means the only place named after the monarch. In Canada alone, no fewer than 62 schools, roads, hospitals and parks are named after Her Majesty, among them an observatory, an island chain and two different mountain ranges. Elsewhere, the list of places named after the Queen includes a city in South Australia, British and Australian Antarctica and Queen Elizabeth National Park, which is famous for its beauty and tree-climbing lions, in Uganda. We're here! The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are all smiles as they walk up the red carpet . Warm welcome: The Queen and the Duke got a warm welcome from High Commission staff . Shake on it: Prince Philip shakes hands with Canadian High Commissioner Gordon Campbell (left) All smiles: The Queen looked cheerful and wore a pretty turquoise tweed coat and a matching hat . Friendly chat: The Queen chats to artist Charles Pachter from Pachter Hall and Moose Factory in Toronto . While the new atrium isn't on quite the same scale, the Queen certainly appeared to enjoy the visit and looked animated as she spoke to the construction team behind it. Before she and the Duke of Edinburgh braved the traffic for a second time on their way home, Her Majesty found time to unveil a plaque and add her name to the visitors book. 'We are honoured that Her Majesty and His Royal Highness were able to join us to celebrate the opening of a high commission that is very dear to Canadians and that reflects the depth of our friendship with the United Kingdom,' said High Commissioner Campbell afterwards. 'It is our pleasure to name such a distinctly Canadian feature of this building in Her Majesty’s honour. Nice view! The Queen inspects the view from one of the windows at the newly refurbished Canada House . Is that for me? The Queen accepts posies from eight-year-old Alexandra Yepez and her sister Natalia, five . Nicely done! The two little girls then showed Her Majesty their very best curtsies, much to her delight . Big day: The two little girls completed their task with aplomb, watched by their mother Lisa Almond . Lovely: The Queen prepares to return to her car, clutching the two very pretty posies . 'Canada House serves as our country’s front door to the United Kingdom. This revitalisation project offered us an ideal opportunity to bring the best of Canada straight to the heart of one of the world’s great cities.' Today's visit comes towards the end of a busy week for the Queen, who has spent much of it conducting official business at Buckingham Palace. Much has focused on her diplomatic work, with the Queen receiving new ambassadors from Egypt, Kazakhstan and Eritrea, as well as entertaining Maltese president, Marie Louise Coleiro Preca, who is making an official visit to the UK. She also attended a reception held to mark the 80th birthday of Diabetes UK at St James's Palace on Tuesday evening. Royal salute: The Mounties gave Her Majesty a sharp salute as she made her way out . Job done: During the visit, the Queen saw the new Queen Elizabeth II Atrium and unveiled a plaque . Traditional: The Queen was greeted by a pair of Canada's iconic Mounties [Royal Canadian Mounted Police] .

"Disgusting: A chewing gum ban could be introduced in Milton Keynes . Milton Keynes is set to become the first town in Britain to introduce a Singapore-style ban on chewing gum. Anyone caught chewing gum would face an on-the-spot fine under the proposal, which was drawn up after 22 pieces of discarded gum were found in just one square foot of pavement. Those in favour of introducing the ban point to the cost of removing gum, the nuisance caused by it sticking to people's shoes and the eyesore it creates. The proposal has been put forward by After8, a group of businesses in the Buckinghamshire town, which plans to lobby the council to adopt it as policy. The group wants resident to give their views on the plans as it looks to boost its case with the local authority. After8 spokeswoman Carmel Blyth said it can cost up to 10p to remove a single piece of gum trodden into the pavement, which includes paying for the chemicals and manpower. She said it is also unsightly, and added: 'Cleaning this mess up is an impossible task, it is costly and takes time, not to mention unpleasant. 'We are also trying to get the message across the people to be considerate. I is a problem in central Milton Keynes but I also think it is a nationwide problem.' Chewing gum has been banned in Singapore for around 20 years, but the authorities made an exception for those with doctors prescriptions in 2004. Clean: The pavements of Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire could soon be chewing gum free . The strict ban on selling, importing . or manufacturing gum was brought in by the city state's founding father, . Lee Kuan Yew, who was fed-up with the litter. Vandals were also reported to have been leaving used gum in keyholes and mail boxes as well as on buttons inside lifts. Anyone caught breaking the ban by chewing gum can be fined but not, as has often been claimed, sentenced to corporal punishment. Smugglers face a stiffer penalty, up to a year in prison and a fine equivalent to around £10,000. Lee Kuan Yew once responded to criticism . that banning gum stifled creativity because people could not . concentrate,by saying: 'If you can't think because you can't chew, try a . banana.' Costly: Removing a single piece of chewing gum trodden into the pavement can cost up to 10p . Milton Keynes council leader, Andrew Geary, said the borough could not make any commitments on bringing in such a ban in the town but was open to suggestions. He added: 'This is the kind of thing where we say if people want to come to us with proposal then we are quite prepared to listen. The difficulty with this will be how easy is it to enforce. 'I don't perceive gum to be a massive problem from what I have seen but if other people do and there are areas where evidence clearly shows that it is, then we are quite prepared to listen.' But Sian O'Keefe, corporate affairs manager for Wrigley UK, said such a ban would be unfair. She added: 'The only effective and sustainable solution to littered gum is to encourage people to dispose of their used gum responsibly. Outlawed: The city state of Singapore where chewing gum has been made for more than 20 years . 'Tackling the problem of littered gum . is something that we take extremely seriously. We promote good gum . disposal messages via packaging, point of sale and other communication . materials  which are regularly seen by millions of our consumers every . day. 'We also fund a number of great . campaigns that aim to encourage responsible litter disposal including . our Bin it! schools programme and the annual Chewing Gum Action Group . campaign, which has seen significant reductions in gum litter in the . areas where it has been in place. 'We believe these campaigns are a . more effective way to address the issue rather than imposing bans or . taxes that would unfairly punish regular chewers, the vast majority of . whom dispose of their gum responsibly.' Last year, painter Ben Wilson found a novel way of dealing with the unsightly come covering the streets of east London. The . artists spent hours at a time painting around 8,000 blots of gum, with . his subjects including everything from the Eiffel tower to Arsenal . Football Club.","Anyone caught chewing gum in the town would face an on-the-spot fine .

"The son of British rock star Jim McCarty has been jailed for 30 years after posing as a charity worker to sexually abuse children as young as six. Simon Jasper McCarty, son of the Yardbirds drummer Jim, filmed himself abusing young children while pretending to be volunteering for their well being. Surrey-based McCarty - a musician like his father - is chairman of a charity which campaigns to protect street children in third world countries. Simon McCarty with his famous father, Yardbirds drummer Jim. McCarty has just been given a 30-year jail term for abusing children . Ulterior motive: Simon McCarty with orphans in Nepal. He set up a charity campaigning to protect street children in third world countries . He helped to set up an orphanage in Nepal and travelled the world offering 'drum therapy' to children, claiming it would boost self-confidence and team building. However, there was a more sinister motive behind his altruism. His position allowed him access to hundreds of children in the UK and aboard, who he photographed while he abused them. McCarty was only caught when, while on a trip to Hawaii, TSA officials searched his laptop bag and discovered pictures of the abused children. Hundreds more images and video clips of child porn were uncovered when they took a closer look at files on his laptop. A further investigation revealed the 40-year-old had used his position of trust to abuse children, including a six-year-old from Nepal and a schoolboy from the West Midlands. Around 400 indecent images and 200 video clips were found on McCarty’s laptop computer and hard-drive as he tried to enter Hawaii in 2008 for a percussion seminar. Some of the home-made videos showed him committing serious sexual assaults on a boy in woodland and in a hotel room. Specialist officers from West Midlands Police’s child online safeguarding team (Cost) identified the victim as a 10-year-old boy from the region. About 400 indecent images and 200 video clips were found on McCarty's laptop computer and hard-drive as he tried to enter Hawaii in 2008 for a percussion seminar . McCarty helped to set up an orphanage in Nepal and travelled the world offering 'drum therapy' to children, claiming it would boost self-confidence and team building . McCarty’s defence had earlier moved to suppress the evidence, saying it was the result of an unlawful search and violated the Fourth Amendment. In his court filing, defence attorney William Harrison noted that 'airport screenings are considered to be administrative searches... where the essential administrative purpose is to prevent the carrying of weapons and explosives aboard aircraft. 'We believed that the TSA agents didn’t have to go through the photographs in order to look for safety concerns in the bag. They did so.' Harrison added: 'All the production did happen outside the US - the UK and other places. 'The problem is you can’t under US law actually bring or transport those photographs and/or videos into the US and possess them.' As part of his McCarty's defence, his attorney also claimed the encounters 'were all consensual, although at that age you can’t consent to it', and that, 'there was nothing that was any type of physical type of duress'. The legal fight went from U.S. District Court in Honolulu up to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and back, before the government prevailed. Two weeks before the long-awaited trial, McCarty pleaded guilty to the charges. His father, Jim McCarty, played drums with the legendary rock and roll band famous for hits such as 'For Your Love' and 'Heartful Of Soul', but who were more famous for launching the guitar careers of Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page. As part of a plea deal, prosecutors did not pursue charges relating to other minors that appeared in the clips. Through a painstaking and delicate interview process the youngster from the West Midlands eventually confided in officers and detailed a catalogue of rape and sexual assaults over a 14-month period between 2005 and 2006. Rock stars: Simon's father Jim (second from right) with his fellow Yardbirds (from left to right) Keith Relf, Chris Droja and Jimmy Page . McCarty admitted to having sexual relations with three children aged 11, 10 and 6. Two of the victims were from the UK and the third was from Nepal. McCarthy, from Surrey, admitted rape, sexual assault and making child pornography before a court in Honolulu today and was sentenced to spend the next 30 years in a federal detention centre. Detective Inspector Kay Wallace, from the West Midlands Police Cost team, said: 'This was a very challenging case and involved international co-operation with U.S. authorities, working across different jurisdictions, over several years. 'At one stage McCarthy lodged an appeal saying customs officials had abused their position by checking his possessions in such detail at the airport - but all the parties worked together to oppose the appeal and ultimately secure his prison sentence. 'Much of the evidence in the case centred on the testimony of the West Midlands boy we identified as being among his victims. 'Officers from our Cost team are trained to interview young, potentially traumatised victims in a sensitive way. Over a period of several days the boy, who initially denied being abused, eventually felt comfortable enough to open up to officers and reveal the extent of McCarthy’s offending.' McCarthy - who founded a company called Talking Drums - was travelling through Hilo airport, Hawaii, on August 5, 2008, when a screener discovered nude photographs of children inside his laptop case. He was detained on suspicion of 'transporting child pornography' - a specific U.S. offence - and his computer equipment seized and forensically examined to reveal the stash of indecent images. Officers at the UK Child Exploitation Online Protection centre traced one of his victims - a six-year-old boy - to the Kathmandu orphanage set up by McCarthy’s charity and an 11-year-old to an address in London. They contacted West Midlands Police when a Trust charity worker recognised a further 10-year-old victim as being a boy living in the region. Det Insp Wallace, said: 'McCarthy used his charitable position to ingratiate himself into the boy’s family. He then shattered the family’s trust by abusing the victim. When the boy began realising the situation was abusive he refused to comply with McCarthy’s requests. McCarthy then disassociated himself from the family. 'I’d like to praise the bravery of the young boy by revealing the abuse and confiding in our officers - his evidence was crucial in placing this sexual predator behind bars for most of his remaining life.' McCarty senior made no comment at the time of his son’s guilty plea.","Son of British rock star Jim McCarty filmed himself abusing young children .

"A measles outbreak believed to have started when an overseas tourist visited Disneyland is sweeping California with the total number of people diagnosed as carrying the virus now at 119. Public health authorities have now revealed the particular strain of the virus which many have tested positive for is the same as that which is linked to an outbreak in the Philippines. The Disneyland resort, located in Anaheim in Southern California, receives millions of visitors a year, many of them coming from overseas. Scroll down for video . The strain of measles found in many of those who caught the virus is the same as that currently afflicting the Philippines . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, measles is a highly contagious virus that lives in an infected person's nose and throat mucus and spreads through coughing and sneezing. The CDCP warned: Measles virus can live for up to two hours on a surface or in an airspace where the infected person coughed or sneezed. 'If other people breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected surface, then touch their eyes, noses, or mouths, they can become infected.' Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes and a red rash that usually first appears on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. The CDPH warned medics to ask patients if they have either travelled to areas with a measles problem or locations domestically with a large number of foreign tourists from infected areas. A report by California Department of Public Health (CDPH) researchers said that specimens from 30 of the state's measles patients had been genotyped and that all were of the same strain which caused the Philippines outbreak. That same genotype has been detected in at least 14 . countries and six other U.S. states in the last six months, the . researchers said, and the source of the illness that sickened . visitors at the  theme park has not been identified. The report was posted on the website of the federal Centers for . Disease Control and Prevention and stated the outbreak illustrates the . need for high measles vaccine rates in the U.S. The outbreak of measles is thought to have started when a person from outside the country carrying the virus visiting Disneyland California (pictured) The outbreak has renewed a debate over the so-called . anti-vaccination movement, in which fears about potential side . effects of vaccines, fueled by now-debunked research suggesting . a link to autism, have prompted a small minority of parents to . refuse inoculations for their children. Some parents also opt not to have their children vaccinated . for religious or other reasons. According to the CDPH, 39 of the 119 people who contracted . measles in the state were believed to have been exposed while . visiting Disneyland. An additional 35 had contacts with those . people in a household or community setting. The state health department said another 45 cases have an . unknown exposure source but are presumed linked to the . Disneyland outbreak based on a combination of descriptive . epidemiology or strain type. Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 . after decades of intensive childhood vaccine efforts. But in . 2014, the country had its highest number of cases in two decades. Most people recover from measles within a few weeks, . although it can be fatal in some cases.","Public health authorities have confirmed 119th measles case in California .

"Ministers will announce a major climbdown on fracking today as they bring in strict controls to protect vast swathes of the British countryside. Shale gas development will be all but banned in National Parks and other protected countryside – and permitted only in ‘exceptional circumstances’. The move from the Department for Energy and Climate Change is likely to be seen as an attempt to head off a potential revolt in Middle England over fracking in the run up to next year’s election. Carried away: Police remove a protester from a fracking site. Today ti will be announced the controversial process is to be curbed . It was welcomed by countryside protection groups yesterday – but will cause dismay among industry and pro-fracking groups, who say the controversial method will cut energy bills, create jobs and deliver decades of energy security. The move tears up bolder suggestions from ministers last year that more than 40 per cent of Britain could be opened up for fracking – as the restricted areas cover huge parts of the county, especially in the Tory heartlands of Southern England. The announcement is in sharp contrast to the rhetoric of former Energy Minister Michael Fallon, who was moved to Defence Secretary in this month’s reshuffle. Last year he said fracking would take place in vast swathes of ‘Dorset all the way along Hampshire, Sussex, East Sussex, West Sussex, all the way perhaps a bit into Surrey and even into my county of Kent. It’s right there.’ Unrest: Pressure groups have fought vociferously against fracking. Pictured above is a protest in Balcombe, West Sussex . He added: ‘We are going to see how thick their rectory walls are, whether they like the flaring at the end of the drive!’ Last night new Energy Minister Matthew Hancock said: ‘The new guidance published today will protect Britain’s great national parks and outstanding landscapes.’ The rules will apply to all National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, World Heritage sites and the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads. Natural Beauty areas make up one fifth of Britain’s countryside, and National Parks 10 per cent of the land area in England. In these areas fracking would only be allowed in ‘exceptional circumstances’ and when it was clearly in the public interest, DECC said. If, as it appears, fracking is severely limited in these areas, it would put a new focus on development in Northern England. A report last year suggested Bowland Shale in Lancashire could contain 1,300trillion cubic feet of gas which could provide for Britain’s energy needs for decades. Drilling: Proponents of fracking claim is will slash bills, create jobs and deliver energy security . Fracking has already proved to be hugely controversial, sparking protests in Balcombe in West Sussex. Ministers also said that planning appeals would be called in by the Communities Secretary Eric Pickles to ensure the rules are being closely observed over the next year. Applications for licences to develop onshore oil and gas in or near the sensitive areas will also have to include new environmental awareness studies. Gung-ho: Former Energy Minister Michael Fallon was in favour of fracking more widely . Whitehall sources insisted the rules did not amount to a ban on fracking in National Parks. One said it would put fracking on the same footing as onshore wind farms. The industry is expected to react badly to the announcement, which is made today as ministers invite new bids for licences to develop shale gas. Around 150 licences are expected to be granted. Once it is approved, a developer will also have to secure local planning permission before drilling can start. Energy investors are likely to see the Whitehall guidance as a tide of red tape which could slow or inhibit shale development. But local communities and some Tory activists will welcome the shift away from fracking in their areas. Shaun Spiers, of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said ‘change in rhetoric is very welcome’, adding: ‘The Government has previously stoked opposition by giving the impression that it is committed to fracking whatever the consequence and however sensitive the location. ‘If fracking is to happen, we need to proceed with great caution and with the highest possible safeguards.’ A National Trust spokesman said: ‘We hope it will reflect a much more cautious approach that recognises the risks of turning some of the most special places in the country over to industrial scale extraction of shale gas and oil.’","Shale gas development will be banned in protected countryside .

"It may be difficult to believe, but according to research published next month a world without war may be getting nearer. Futurologists from the University of Oslo in Norway and the Peace Research Institute Oslo have predicted that global conflict will halve in the next 40 years. Their study claims the combination of . higher education, lower infant mortality, smaller youth cohorts, and . lower population growth are a few of the reasons why the world can . expect a more peaceful future. World at war: Soldiers who support Guinea-Bissau's breakaway military leaders known as The Junta fire at a position held by Senegalese soldiers . Conflict zone: Palestinians burn a U.S. flag near the United Nations office in Gaza City earlier this month. The on-going tension in the region will die down by 2050, research suggests . Professor Håvard Hegre predicts conflict will be on the wane by 2050. Here's how the war map will change . That will mean in the next five years the current conflicts in Libya, Tajikistan, Syria, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Mauritania and Iraq will probably be over, the research suggests. As the risk of war decreases worldwide, by 2017 it will be greatest in India, Ethiopia, the Philippines, Uganda and Burma. And by 2050, as the number of countries at war falls from one in six to one in 12, the risk of conflict will be greatest in India, Nigeria, Sudan, Ethiopia and Tanzania. The conclusions were made by Håvard Hegre, a professor in the university's department of political science, who has devised a statistical model in collaboration with Oslo's Peace Research Institute. The model, it is claimed, is capable of telling us what is likely to happen in the future. 'The number of conflicts is falling,' said Professor Hegre. 'We expect this fall to continue. We predict a steady fall in the number of conflicts in the next 40 years. Futurologist: Research by Professor Håvard Hegre suggests conflict will halve by 2050 . 'Conflicts that involve a high degree of violence, such as Syria, are becoming increasingly rare. 'We put a lot of work into developing statistical methods that enable us, with a reasonable degree of certainty, to predict conflicts in the future. 'A conflict is defined as a conflict between governments and political organisations that use violence and in which at least 25 people die. This means that the model does not cover either tribal wars or solo terrorists like Anders Behring Breivik. 'In the 1700s it was normal to go to war to expand your country's territory. This strategy has passed its sell by date. But, demands for democracy may be suppressed with violence and result in more violence in the short term. As in Libya.' His research has found there has been a decrease in armed conflicts and the number of people killed since World War II and this trend will continue. 'War has become less acceptable, just like duelling, torture and the death penalty.' Infant mortality, calculated by the UN up to 2050, is one of the key factors in Professor Hegre's model. 'Countries with a high infant mortality rate have a high probability of conflict. Infant mortality is now decreasing everywhere.' The UN has also estimated population structure up to 2050. The population is expected to grow, but at a slower pace than today, and the proportion of young people will decrease in most countries, with the exception of countries in Africa. The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Vienna has extrapolated the level of education up to 2050. The . simulation model is also based on the last 40 years' history of . conflicts, of all countries and their neighbours in the world, oil . resources and ethnicity. The conflict data were collated by the Uppsala . University . 'Economic . changes in society have resulted in both education and human capital . becoming important. A complex economy makes political violence less . attractive. Kurdish soldiers patrol the mountainous Iraq-Turkey border region where conflict has raged . Nigeria is one of the countries where the risk of war will be greatest in 2050. Here Nigerian soldiers march towards protestors during a demonstration against spiraling fuel prices in Lagos earlier this year . Risk of war: An armed man waves his rifle as buildings and cars are engulfed in flames after being set on fire inside the US consulate compound in Benghazi, Libya, last month . 'It has become too expensive to kill people. Modern society is dependent on economic development. It is too expensive to use violence to destroy this network. It has also become harder to take financial capital by force. 'It is easy to move capital across national borders. Therefore, a cynical leader will be less likely to choose violence as a strategy.' It is hard to discern the most important reason why the future will be more peaceful, but some studies suggest that education is the crucial factor. 'Education may be a fundamental causal explanation, but this is difficult to show with our methods. Demographers believe that more education leads to fewer children. There are fewer mouths to feed.' Another explanation is the UN's peacekeeping operations. The world has become better at employing means of preventing states using violence. 'The UN operations in Bosnia and Somalia failed. But the UN's operations have been more successful since 2000. Of course, the UN cannot prevent conflicts, but fewer die and the intensity is lower when they intervene.' Drawing to an end? Anti-government fighters celebrate the fall of Sirte in Syria in October last year . Tension continues: An unidentified U.S. soldier stands in front of the blast-shattered Khobar Towers building in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia . Prof Hegre used data from 1970 to 2000 to check whether or not the conflict model works as intended. He wanted to see if the model could predict the actual conflicts between 2001 and 2009 . 'For 2009 we estimated that the likelihood of a conflict was more than 50 per cent in 20 countries. 16 of these countries ended up in a real conflict. We missed by four countries.' The simulation programme, which for statistical reasons must be run 18,000 times, was programmed by Joakim Karlsen, a research fellow at Østfold University College. But changes had to be made as the on-going instability in the Middle East impacted the model. 'Prior to the Arabian spring, we expected 5 per cent of the countries in the world to be involved in a conflict in 2050. This percentage has now risen to 7 per cent. 'The conflicts in the Middle East weaken the clear correlation between socio-economic development and the absence of civil war. The conflicts in Syria and Libya show that we also have to include democratisation processes in the model. 'To achieve this, we are now working on projecting democratic systems of government and regime changes,' explains Prof Hegre. The study is due to be published in the periodical International Studies Quarterly next month.","University of Oslo research suggests number of countries at war will fall from one in six to one in 12 .

"Authorities have repeatedly refused to reveal any information about the circumstances in which Poppi Worthington (pictured) died . The facts surrounding the suspicious death of a 13-month-old girl remain shrouded in official secrecy nearly two years on. Judges have imposed a draconian order preventing details of the death of Poppi Worthington from being revealed. Authorities have repeatedly refused to reveal any information about the circumstances in which Poppi died, despite a long-running police investigation. During an inquest this week that lasted a mere seven minutes, a coroner simply ruled that the cause of her death was ‘unascertained’ and failed to disclose any other information. The police investigation has led to the arrest of two people, including Poppi’s father Paul Worthington, 46, who was questioned on suspicion of sexually abusing his child. No one has yet been charged as a result of the Cumbria Police inquiry, which continues. But it can be revealed that the force itself is being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) over its response to the death. An officer has been suspended after concerns that the force did not respond ‘properly and appropriately’. At the inquest on Tuesday, the coroner merely referred to a family court hearing held in private earlier this year and opted to rely on its findings. A far-reaching injunction means that the media has been prevented from revealing various details about the case, including where Poppi lived or the hospital in which she died. Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming, who campaigns for open justice in the family courts, said that the injunction could prevent wrongdoing by public bodies from coming to light. ‘The strict injunctions that sometimes apply in family court proceedings often act to protect public officials from allegations that they have not done their job properly rather than protecting a child,’ he said. ‘In this case, anonymity for the family may be reasonable – but why can we not know any more? A lot of these injunctions just protect people who receive a salary from being questioned.’ A serious case review, begun by the Cumbria Local Safeguarding Board in April, may eventually be made public. Cumbria County Council said it had no involvement in Poppi’s life before her death on December 12, 2012. During the inquest at Cumbria Coroner’s Court, coroner Ian Smith recorded an open conclusion. He acknowledged that the circumstances around the death were ‘unusual and strange’ but failed to elaborate on any aspects of Poppi’s brief life or death. Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming (pictured), who campaigns for open justice in the family courts, said that the injunction could prevent wrongdoing by public bodies from coming to light . The inquest also appeared to be veiled in secrecy, with a listing for the hearing omitting Poppi’s name and instead referring to ‘a child aged 13 months’. The opening of the inquest in February 2013 also took place in private, with no recording or transcript available. According to coroners’ rules, inquests should always be held in public unless exceptional matters of national security are involved. Mr Smith said he was happy to rely on the findings of a judge in the High Court’s family division in June and did not need to go over the same ground. The Daily Mail has joined other media organisations in arguing that there is a public interest in revealing how Poppi died and how authorities dealt with her. Cumbria Police confirmed that a 30-year-old woman and 46-year-old man have been arrested and remain on police bail. In a statement the force said: ‘Cumbria Police can confirm that an investigation is still ongoing into the death of a one-year-old girl who died in Cumbria on Wednesday, December 12, 2012.’ ‘We can confirm that the constabulary has made a referral to the IPCC and they are conducting an investigation. ‘Currently a number of officers are subject of the investigation and one officer has been suspended.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Judges impose orders stopping details of baby's death from being revealed .

"Utah is more religious than any other American state with more than half its residents claiming to attend church services every week, a study shows. It beats the entire 'Bible Belt' of the South, and far outstrips the Northeast, where church attendance is the lowest in the country. Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana and Arkansas complete the top five, as Vermont trails last. Religious map of America: This is a visualization of data showing how many people attend church once a week . According to a survey by Gallup, 51 per cent of Utahns attend church at least once a week. The figures are likely a result of the fact that 59percent of the state self-identifies as Mormon, the faith that boasts higher levels of church attendance than any other religion in the US. The South owes its high level of church attendance to sizable black and Protestant populations, the study authors report. With just 17percent of self-proclaimed weekly churchgoers, Vermont came last in the list, closely followed by New Hampshire (20 per cent), Maine (20 per cent), and Massachusetts (22 per cent). Mormon: Utah owes its high level of regular church attendance to the fact that most residents are Mormon (Salt Lake City pictured) Connecticut is also in the bottom 10, along with Washington, Alaska, Colorado, and Hawaii, where less than a quarter of residents go to church regularly. Gallup interviewed 177,030 American adults between January and December 2014, asking: 'How often do you attend church, synagogue or mosque -- at least once a week, almost every week, about once a month, seldom or never?' According to the report, the question was chosen as a barometer to reflect each person's 'underlying religiosity'.","More than half of Utah's residents say they attend church once a week .

"When Wayne Hart, 44, was warned that he only had five years to live if he failed to lose weight, he envisaged a life spent munching salads while watching wife Helen eating whatever she liked. But his wife had other ideas and now both halves of the couple, who hail from Caerphilly in Wales, getting his and hers gastric bands. Since the operation, the heavyweight couple have lost an astonishing 23st between them and say the surgery was the best thing they ever did. Wayne and Helen Hart got joint gastric bands after he was told he would die within five years and she was told she couldn't have hip surgery if she didn't lose six stone . The 2010 operation came after their £200-a-week takeaway habit left both severely overweight and tipping the scales at a combined 55st. Mrs Hart, 43, who met her husband while on a rugby tour, says they were eating around 7,000 calories a day but doing nothing to burn it off. 'We were having takeaway every night of the week,' added Mr Hart. 'Sometimes we'd even have it two or three times in a day.' Mr Hart's problems began after he had knee surgery, which stopped him exercising and left him struggling to beat the bulge. Tipping the scales at nearly 32 stone, he was told he only had five years to live if he didn't take drastic action. ''I knew I had to do something,' he recalls. 'I went to the NHS but I couldn't get the surgery there so we decided to go private.' At his biggest, Wayne weighed 32st and said he struggled to keep the weight off after a knee operation . Helen needed to have a hip operation but was told she wouldn't be able to have it until she had lost five stone . The joint operation cost the couple their £19,000 life savings, although they did receive a £1,000 discount for booking two procedures. Although Mrs Hart's life wasn't in danger, she wanted to have the operation for health reasons and to help her lose 6st. In the event, the couple had their operations in the same day with Mrs Hart booked in at 9am and her husband going in two hours later at 11am. Following the joint operation, the couple were forced to cut their calories from nearly 7000 a day to just 500. As a result, Mrs Hart now weighs a relatively slimline 16st, while operations manager Mr Hart weighs 17st 5lb. It took just one month for the couple to each lose 3st, although Mr Hart says slimming down wasn't always easy. 'It really helped having each other,' he explains. 'I definitely don't think we could have done it on our own. It must be really hard for people doing it on their own. Helen is now happy with her weight and the couple have no plans to have their bands removed . Wayne says he wouldn't mind losing another stone but he is happy with what he has achieved so far . 'For the first six to eight months we really struggled and for the first three, I really suffered from depression. 'It was really tough and I didn't know if I was going to get through it but I had a great team of doctors who really helped me.' 'I had my procedure at the same time as Wayne so we have been on the weight loss journey together,' added his wife. 'I have lost around 5st and Wayne has lost 16st – or the equivalent of more than 100 bags of sugar as I like to remind him.' The couple have lost nearly 23 stone between them and are now happy with their weight . Mrs Hart says she also found her reduced diet a struggle at times but says having her husband going through the same thing with her made all the difference. 'You have to get used to what you can and can't eat we were going from around 7000 calories a day to about 1000,' adds her husband. 'It's things like going out for dinner with your family - you can't just order a big meal, you have to have a starter. 'Even then it takes you as long to eat as it takes everyone else to get through a three course meal.' But despite the reduced diets, Mr Hart says he wouldn't have the gastric band removed. 'It is hard but I wouldn't have it removed,' he confirms. 'I got to have a check up every month just to make sure everything is ok. I'm hoping to lose one more stone but I feel happy I've already lost so much.'","Wayne and Helen Hart lost 23st between them after surgery .

"When BBC documentary Reinventing the Royals was first listed on TV schedules in Iate December, few paid it much attention. But when claims that Clarence House  had refused to release archive footage and had tried to stop it from being aired emerged in the Radio Times, the programme suddenly became front page news. Tonight, Reinventing the Royals, a two-part series written and presented by Panorama journalist Steve Hewlett will finally air, while Clarence House has denied ever trying to prevent it. Scroll down for video . Royal row: The Prince of Wales will feature in Reinventing the Royals, the BBC documentary airing tonight . So is it really as damaging as some have claimed? The series opens with the death of Princess Diana in 1997, with the first episode focusing on the brickbats hurled at Prince Charles in its wake. With his personal popularity in the doldrums, Charles asked PR guru Mark Bolland, who was hired in 1996, to give his public image a makeover - and integrate Camilla Parker Bowles into palace life. Dubbed 'Operation Mrs PB', the campaign is the source of one of the most embarrassing allegations aired in the programme - namely that Bolland leaked news of Prince William's first meeting with Camilla to the media. Bolland has denied this incident ever happened, but the Duke of Cambridge was reportedly left angry and upset by the leak and is said to have nicknamed the PR supremo 'Blackadder'. But even that has been overshadowed by the controversy over the programme itself, which Clarence House insists it never tried to interfere with. 'The original broadcast of the programme was delayed by mutual agreement (BBC and Clarence House) whilst permissions were sought,' said a Clarence House spokesman. Investigation: The series, fronted by Steve Hewlett (c), delves into the media's relationship with the royals . Controversial: Hewlett was editor of Panorama when it broadcast the infamous 1995 Princess Diana interview . 'All permissions were subsequently granted. We have not seen the programme yet and have no comment to make.' Nevertheless, the ensuing row reportedly left Prince Charles 'furious' - all the more so when lurid claims of spats between the Buckingham Palace and Clarence House press teams emerged. Worse still, the row overshadowed what had been, until then, a successful year, with the royal widely praised for his hard work and the positive headlines generated by overseas tours to Colombia and Jordan among others. For its part, the BBC says the documentary was always going to be aired, with a spokesman telling MailOnline that coverage is going ahead 'as planned'. 'Before Christmas it became clear that there were issues relating to the clearance of archive footage in the forthcoming programme Reinventing The Royals,' continued the BBC spokesman. Campaign: Much of the controversy focuses on Mark Bolland (l) and Sandy Henney (r) also features . Unimpressed: The Duke of Cambridge (l) reportedly referred to Bolland as 'Blackadder' 'These issues have now been resolved and all the archive material we planned to use is included in the finished programme. 'The first episode of Reinventing The Royals will be broadcast on 19 February and it will be the one that we always intended to show.' The footage includes the first-ever television interview with Sandy Henney, who was press secretary to Prince Charles at the time of Princess Diana's death. Even before the accident, the Prince was worried his image was 'in tatters' while the Royal family were also alarmed by the anti-monarchist feeling following the Diana's death in Paris. '(Charles) was getting some pretty virulent criticism - bad father, unloving husband,' Ms Henney said in the documentary. Furious: Charles was reportedly unhappy about the way the row overshadowed his work . Success: 2014 had been a successful year but ended on a sour note because of the controversy . 'I think he was pretty hurt... if you've got a middle-aged balding man and a beautiful princess, it's a no-brainer as to who is going to get the media coverage.' Steve Hewlett, the editor of Panorama at the time of the infamous 1995 interview with Princess Diana, presents the show and describes how Prince Charles hired Mark Bolland from the Press Complaints Commission to act as a spin doctor for the Royal family following Diana's death. The younger royals also make an appearance in the documentary, among them Prince Harry who at one point opines: 'I don't believe there is any such thing as privacy anymore.' Testament, if nothing else, to the sometimes troubled relationship between the royals and the Press.","Charles was reportedly left fuming over controversy caused by the row .

"Two Orthodox rabbis have been arrested for allegedly plotting to kidnap and beat Jewish men - using cattle prods and karate moves - so that they would divorce their wives. Mendel Epstein and Martin Wolmark were arrested following a sting operation with an undercover agent posing as unhappily married woman in New Jersey, the FBI announced on Thursday. Orthodox rules allow only a man to initiate a divorce, but the rabbis allegedly told the woman they would torture her husband into agreeing to one - if she paid tens of thousands of dollars. Accused: Rabbi Mendel Epstein, pictured, was arrested with another rabbi and two other men for allegedly offering to kidnap and torture husbands so they'd grant their wives divorces . They allegedly said they would use . electric cattle prods, karate and handcuffs and put plastic bags over . the heads of reluctant husbands, and found warehouses to hold the men . hostage. The men allegedly told the agent that they carried out similar jobs every 18 months in the community. Sources . told WCBS that the alleged scheme has been in place for as long as 20 . years, and 1010 WINS reported that there have been more than a dozen . kidnappings tied to it. In . August, the rabbis allegedly met to authorize the plot, telling the . woman they wanted $10,000 for the kidnapping and between $50,000 to . $60,000 to pay a 'tough guy' to carry out the beatings. In Jewish law, in order to be granted a . religious divorce, a husband must provide his wife with a document . known as a 'get'. Only a husband can initiate divorce by issuing the . 'get'. Probe: An FBI agent stands guard as evidence sits in the trunk of a vehicle at the Brooklyn residence of Rabbi Mendel Epstein during an investigation early Thursday morning following his arrest . Seized: Several defendants, including Epstein and another rabbi, (none pictured) were arrested in an overnight sting . After the agent . contacted Wolmark, he allegedly said in a recorded phone call: 'You have . to, we have to, convene a special beth din and see if there are grounds . to, to, to coerce him on the ""get"".' He said that she needed to make sure he could get to New York, where someone could harass him. A week later, the agents met with Epstein in New Jersey and he talked about kidnapping and torturing the husbands. 'Basically . what we are going to be doing is kidnapping a guy for a couple of hours . and beating him up and torturing him and then getting him to give the . ""get"",' Epstein allegedly said. 'I . guarantee you that if you’re in the van, you’d give a ""get"" to your . wife. You probably love your wife, but you’d give a ""get"" when they . finish with you.'

"A former Fortune 500 executive has admitted that he killed a pregnant woman and her fiancé when he tried to kill himself by driving his pickup truck across a highway median into oncoming traffic. Robert Dellinger, 54, pleaded guilty on Thursday to negligent homicide for the deaths of 24-year-old Amanda Murphy and 29-year-old Jason Timmons, of Wilder, Vermont. He also pleaded guilty to assault for the death of their fetus. Murphy was eight months pregnant. Dellinger, of Sunapee, New Hampshire, was initially charged with manslaughter, but that was later upgraded to second-degree murder. Pleaded guilty: Robert Dellinger, 54, has admitted to killing two people as he tried to kill himself on a highway . Tragic: John Timmons, 29, and Amanda Murphy, 24, were killed instantly in the crash on December 7, 2013 . 'I’m extremely remorseful to the families, and to my own family, as well. I wish I could have that day over,' Dellinger said in court. Negligent homicide is a lesser charge. Dellinger will be sentenced in April. Dellinger, who held high-level posts at PPG Industries Inc., Sprint Corp., Delphi Corp. and General Electric Co., told investigators he was trying to kill himself on December 7, 2013, when he steered his pickup across a highway median in Lebanon, New Hampshire. His truck became airborne and sheared the top off of the victims' SUV, causing injuries so severe that the medical examiner said the couple looked like they had been in a plane crash. The Vermont couple, who had met while working at a home for the elderly, were killed instantly. Pregnant: This is an ultrasound of the couple's unborn baby who they were going to call Reagan Elizabeth . Crushed: This is a picture of the scene of the crash after Dellinger careered over the central median . Dellinger, who suffered cuts on his head and face, was initially charged with two counts of reckless manslaughter. Miss Murphy, 24, was excited to be a mother for the first time, and the couple had already named their unborn baby girl Reagan Elizabeth. A week before the crash, the residential center where the couple worked together hosted a baby shower for them. Catherine Amarante, executive director at the facility, described the couple as 'very loving'. Arraignment: Robert J. Dellinger, was is arraigned by video at Lebanon District Court in Lebanon, New Hampshire, on December 11, 2013, a few days after the crash . Excited: Amanda Murphy and Jason Timmons, pictured with one of his three children from a previous relationship, were looking forward to the arrival of their baby girl . Mr Timmons, 29, was also a father to three children from a previous relationship. According to prosecution, the former executive had argued with his wife over his . medications on the morning of the crash, WMUR reported. 'He was driving around, depressed and loopy,' senior assistant attorney general for New Hampshire Susan Morrell said. 'He saw the median and decided to turn into it.' Dellinger's lawyer, R. Peter Decato, . however called the state's comments 'over the top' and said Dellinger had led a . 'productive and exemplary life.' The married father had served as senior vice president and chief financial officer at Fortune 500 company PPG Industries Inc. He . took a severance package worth more than $1 million in cash plus stocks . when he left in 2011 because of health reasons, according to documents . filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. After . his earlier arraignment, Dellinger had been freed on $250,000 cash bond . and ordered to wear an electronic tag and undergo a psychiatric . evaluation.

"By his own exorbitantly high standards, Cristiano Ronaldo had been in something of a rut as of late. The three-time Ballon d'Or winner had failed to score in his past three games for Real Madrid and was under scrutiny from some sections of the Spanish press ahead of Los Blancos' round of 16 Champions League tie with Schalke. But in the 26th minute, Ronaldo proved his doubters wrong, thumping a powerful header past third-choice keeper Timon Wellenreuther from Daniel Carvajal's cross to give Real a 1-0 lead. Cristiano Ronaldo has ended his three-game goal drought against Schalke in the Champions League . Ronaldo scored with a powerful header from Daniel Carvajal's cross to give his side the lead . It was refreshing to see that the media's cynicism had not spilled over into Real's fanbase and several supporters brought banners of well-wishes for Ronaldo. To the casual observer, three games without a goal might not seem that big a deal, especially considering that Ronaldo had already netted 36 times beforehand. But the mini-drought came as a sub-plot to a wider concern about the player's form or rather his attitude. Ronaldo was recently criticised for going ahead with his birthday celebrations in a nightclub just hours after Real had lost 4-0 to city rivals Atletico in the Madrid derby. The goal against Schalke, incidentally, was Ronaldo's 464th for club and country since starting his career in 2002. One Real Madrid fan reveals her unwavering support for Cristiano Ronaldo .

"British voters have been urged not to vote for far-right anti-immigration parties - by the grandson of a leading Nazi war criminal. Rainer Hoss, whose grandfather Rudolf Hoss was the infamous commandant of Auschwitz, warned that he fears the rise of neo-Nazi extremists all across Europe. His warning comes just days after Nigel Farage was criticised for a 'racial slur' on Romanian immigrants and was accused of repeatedly using the n-word. One of the party's candidates was also photographed naked showing off a series of Third Reich-themed tattoos. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Rainer Hoss is determined to fight against the legacy of his grandfather Rudolf, whose war crimes at Auschwitz led to the deaths of more than a million Jews and other minorities . Mr Farage was attacked for claiming that he would be 'uncomfortable' if a group of Romanians moved next door to him. When asked why there was a difference between Romanians and Germans he said: 'You know the difference.' Labour leader Ed Miliband, whose Jewish father Ralf fled the Nazis for Britain in 1940, this morning said the remarks were 'completely out of order'. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I think it was deeply offensive, I think it was wrong what he said. 'I don't know Nigel Farage very well, I think he made one remark which was completely wrong, completely out of order, and was a slur.' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said that Mr Farage's remarks had revealed his 'divisive, nasty approach' to politics. And David Cameron this morning said the Ukip leader had said some 'really pretty unpleasant things'. The Prime Minister added: 'He has even himself had to admit he got it wrong. 'I will leave others to judge but what I have heard from some of the candidates, some of the donors to the party is a succession of pretty appalling things. 'I would just say to people look, what we need in Britain is not the politics of anger, we need the politics of the answer - how do we get migration better under control, how do we reform our welfare, how do we get the relationship right with Europe. 'I am offering solutions, I am offering a plan, a plan that is working with our economy, and people should veer away from some of these statements.' Nigel Farage admitted that he made a mistake in his remarks about Romanians. But has come under increasing fire over his party's extremists candidates - including one from Hastings who has a series of Third Reich tattoos on his arms . The anti neo-Nazi campaign video features a number of close up shots of Rainer Hoss, who reveals that he is haunted by his grandfather's crimes . The remarks came after Ukip's Kevin O’Doherty, who is standing for a seat in Hastings, East Sussex, was photographed with a series of offensive images tattooed on his left arm. They included a German eagle, used by Hitler during the Second World War, and two German Stuka planes diving towards a Jewish Star of David, coloured in yellow — the same colour as the badge Jews were forced to wear during the Holocaust. Mr O'Doherty contacted MailOnline, admitting that the the Stuka 'was an instrument of death', but insisting that he was not a Nazi. Mr Farage has also been accused of repeatedly using the n-word when referring to black voters. Ukip founder Professor Alan Sked said the storm of controversy provoked by Mr Farage’s remarks about Romanians ‘backs up what I have always said’ about the Ukip leader’s private views on race. ‘He told me, “We needn’t worry about the n****r vote”,’ Professor Sked said. ‘He added: “The n**-n**s will never vote for us.”’ Mr Farage last night insisted the 'vast majority' of Romanians in the UK would make 'good neighbours' as he sought to limit the damage caused by his controversial suggestion he would be concerned if a group of people from the eastern European country moved in next door. The party took out a full-page advertisement in a national newspaper to insist Ukip was not racist but repeated its warning about the risk posed by organised criminal gangs from Romania. Mr Farage said his comments about people being right to be concerned if a group of Romanian men moved in next door had caused a 'predictable storm of protest and accusations of racism'. UKIP leader Nigel Farage has predicted that his party will win Thursday's European elections after accusing the other parties of being in hock to the EU . The Ukip leader initially stood by his remarks, which came during a bruising interview with LBC, but last night he said: 'Do you know what, in life sometimes people get things wrong.' He told BBC News: 'I regret the fact that I was completely tired out and I didn't use the form of words in response that I would have liked to have used. Ed Miliband accused Nigel Farage of a 'racial slur' by claiming there was a 'difference' between a group of Romanian men moving next door and a German family. But Mr Miliband said he did not believe the Ukip leader was a racist . 'I should have just hit back immediately and said: 'Look, understand there is a real problem here - you can't deny it - too much criminality from these gangs has come to London"".' But Nazi grandson Mr Hoss claimed voters are in danger of letting history repeat itself and urges people to get out and vote for mainstream parties. More than a million people were butchered . at Auschwitz under Rudolf Hoss. His grandson Rainer only became aware . of his family's role in the war as a 12 twelve-year old boy. In the viral campaign video, Mr Höss says: 'I know more than most people about the desire to forget. 'There have been times when I have wanted to deny my past - pretend I was someone else. 'But we must never forget our past, no matter how much it hurts. Because, when we forget history will repeat itself. 'I fear that this is happening right now. All over Europe, far-right political parties are gaining ground and if we do nothing we have learned nothing. 'My name is Rainer Höss, my grandfather was Rudolf Höss, the Nazi commandant of the Auschwitz extermination camp. 'My history taught me democracy, equality and human rights never can be taken for granted. Never forget to vote.' The video, which has been backed by TV star Stephen Fry, was the brainchild of the Swedish Social Democratic Youth League, which has launched a European campaign to get people to vote in this Thursday's European elections.","Rainer Hoss's grandfather was infamous commandant of Auschwitz .

"A potentially deadly 'superbug' resistant to antibiotics infected seven patients, including two who died, and nearly 200 others were exposed at a Southern California hospital through contaminated medical instruments, UCLA reported Wednesday. A total of 179 patients at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center were exposed to CRE during endoscopic procedures between October and January, University of California, Los Angeles spokeswoman Dale Tate said. The bacteria may have been a 'contributing factor' in the deaths of two patients, a university statement said. Scroll down for video . A total of 179 patients at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center were exposed to CRE during endoscopic procedures between October and January, University of California, Los Angeles spokeswoman Dale Tate said . Similar outbreaks of Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) have been reported around the nation. They are difficult to treat because some varieties are resistant to most known antibiotics.  By one estimate, CRE can contribute to death in up to half of seriously infected patients, according to the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The bacteria can cause infections of the bladder or lungs, leading to coughing, fever or chills. CRE infections have been reported in every state except Idaho, Alaska and Maine, according to the CDC. The CDC says on its website 'Healthy people usually do not get CRE infections – they usually happen to patients in hospitals, nursing homes, and other healthcare settings. 'Patients whose care requires devices like ventilators (breathing machines), urinary (bladder) catheters, or intravenous (vein) catheters, and patients who are taking long courses of certain antibiotics are most at risk for CRE infections.' UCLA said infections may have been transmitted through two endoscopes used during the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic and bile-duct problems. 'We notified all patients who had this type of procedure, and we were using seven different scopes. Only two of them were found to be infected. In an abundance of caution, we notified everybody,' Tate said. Fatal: The bacteria may have been a 'contributing factor' in the deaths of two patients, a UCLA statement said .

The bacteria can cause infections of the bladder or lungs, leading to coughing, fever or chills. CRE infections have been reported in every state except Idaho, Alaska and Maine, according to the CDC . The two medical devices carried the bacteria even though they were sterilized according to the manufacturer's specifications, UCLA said. 'We removed the infected instruments, and we have heightened the sterilization process,' Tate said. Potentially infected patients are being sent free home-testing kits that UCLA will analyze, the university said. Preventative measures for patients include frequent hand washing, taking antibiotic medications only as prescribed, and asking questions, according to the CDC. 'Expect all doctors, nurses, and other healthcare providers wash their hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub before and after touching your body or tubes going into your body,' the agency says on its website. 'If they do not, ask them to do so.' A similar outbreak occurred in Illinois in 2013. Dozens of patients were exposed to CRE, with some cases apparently linked to a tainted endoscope used at Advocate Lutheran General Hospital. The hospital later changed its sterilization procedures. A Seattle hospital, Virginia Mason Medical Center, reported in January that CRE linked to an endoscope sickened at least 35 patients, and 11 died, although it was unclear whether the infection played a role in their deaths.","A total of 179 patients at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center were exposed to CRE during endoscopic procedures between October and January .

"Sunderland manager Gus Poyet has urged supporters to 'make sure that we don’t let anyone break our relationship' with the club just two points above relegation and out of both cup competitions. During Sunday's 2-0 FA Cup defeat to League One Bradford City, chants of 'Gus Poyet, it's always our fault' were directed at the manager, who promptly accused the media of misleading fans by misquoting him. But now Poyet has attempted to clear the air with angry supporters by writing an impassioned open letter published on Sunderland's website. You can read the message in full below: . Gus Poyet hit out at the media for misleading fans at Bradford - and has now written to the supporters . Sunderland supporters chanted 'Gus Poyet, it's always our fault' when the team went down 2-0 to Bradford . For the first time in my life I think is time for me to write this letter to you, the fans. When I had the opportunity to become the head coach of Sunderland AFC, I just closed my eyes and remember me sitting at the away dressing room at the Stadium of Light at half time, 4-0 down, Sunderland 4 Chelsea 0, incredible atmosphere, one of the best I ever felt, so the decision was easy, yes I would love the possibility of coaching Sunderland with those fans. Luckily I got the job. I was brought into the club to stay in the Premier League first and most, then get stability and then progress with an identity in our game. The first goal was the most difficult task of my life but we not only stayed up in a miraculous way, we went to Wembley for the first time in years, plus successful games against our biggest rivals and enjoyed some incredible victories away from home. What we achieved last year was achieved by all of us together: club (chairman, directors, staff and players) and fans, nobody and I mean nobody from outside helped us a bit, it was only us together. Then my second aim was to achieve stability, progression and then slowly start bringing a special way of playing football to make you very proud of our team. This takes time, but even if the aim is clear during the process, we need to keep competing and winning games somehow. During my career as a player, coach or manager, I have always had a fantastic relationship with the fans, from my time in Uruguay going through every team in Europe, always the relationship was strong, one of mutual respect and understanding, I showed from inside or from outside the pitch, my commitment, passion and dedication in achieving what every club deserved. Of course I went through good and bad times, successful and not so good ones, winning or losing finals, but I left every single club having a recognition from the fans for my honesty, passion and professional work. So let's make sure that we don’t let anyone to break our relationship, I promise you that I care and want to win as much as you do and no one thinks more time every day about the team than I do, so I invite all of you to stay positive, to be strong, closer to each other and keep believing in what we started together last year, working harder to make it better this season. To finish I would like to clarify once more: the main responsible of the results of our team is me, I always said it and I will always accept my responsibility. I am really looking forward to see the Stadium of Light packed on Saturday, pushing the team to what could be a very important victory. Thank you and regards to all . Gus Poyet .

"'A huge hero': Nadezhda Tolokonnikova has been refusing food for two weeks to protest at the harsh conditions where she was being held . Pussy Riot hunger striker Nadezhda Tolokonnikova has been moved to a new prison after a climbdown by the Russian authorities. The 23-year-old punk group singer is serving a two-year sentence for ‘hooliganism’ after performing a protest song against President Vladimir Putin in a Russian Orthodox cathedral. Feminist activist Nadezhda has been refusing food for two weeks in protest at the harsh conditions in her Soviet-era gulag, 300 miles east of Moscow. It was her second hunger strike – started after she sent a letter to a news website revealing abuses of prisoners at the Mordovia penal colony. She spoke of death threats from senior prison officers, slave-like labour conditions, female inmates being forced to strip naked as they sew uniforms, the banning of toilet breaks and punishment beatings. ‘Inmates are afraid of their own shadows,’ she wrote in the letter. On Friday, officials at the Federal Penitentiary Service bowed to her demand to be transferred to another prison. They said it was ‘for her personal safety’ – but would not reveal where she had been moved to. Her husband Pyotr Verzilov, 26, said: ‘Nadezhda is a huge hero after what she has gone through. I am so very proud of her. She stood up for what she believed in. But we’ve got no information as to where she might be now and she’s so weak.’","Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 23, has been refusing food for two weeks as part of a protest at the harsh conditions at the Mordovia penal colony .

"Holidaymakers who were returning from a getaway in sunny Spain were stranded at City of Derry Airport for two hours yesterday because no one was there to check their passports. The delay affected dozens of passengers who landed on a Ryanair flight from the tourist resort of Alicante and others who flew in from Birmingham. They were forced to wait until an employee arrived to staff the passport control checkpoint and clear the backlog at the airport northeast of Derry, Northern Ireland. Passengers were stranded at City of Derry Airport because no one was there to check their passports . Irish singer-songwriter Mickey Joe Harte was stuck in the queue after returning from a Spanish holiday with his family. He described the situation in an interview with Highland Radio while a UK Border Force member was en route to the airport: ‘There’s a planeload of people waiting here patiently to get through passport control. ‘Everybody’s just a wee bit frustrated here.’ Airport staff gave the stranded passengers tea and sandwiches while they waited in the baggage area, and some travellers were feeling anxious because they had booked taxis or train tickets to travel home or continue their journey. He said: ‘Staff have been doing what they can top appease everybody here. I suppose they can’t let us go any further until we’re all checked.’ Everyone remained calm while most people stood or sat on the floor because of a lack of seats: ‘I think everybody’s chilled out after their holidays.’ Britain's Home Office has launched an investigation to find out why passport control was unmanned . The British Home Office apologised for the delay and launched an investigation to find out why no one was there to receive the passengers. A Home Office spokesperson told MailOnline Travel: ‘Officers were deployed as usual from Belfast International Airport as soon as they became aware of the issue and all passengers were subsequently cleared. ‘Security of the border is our priority and we have to carry out the necessary passport checks. We are investigating the circumstances of this incident.’ City of Derry Airport also extended an apology to the passengers. It said the travellers were kept on the plane but were eventually allowed to disembark and wait in the terminal due to the length of the delay. In addition to food and refreshments, complimentary car parking was provided to the passengers, the airport said.","Passengers were forced to wait in a baggage area at City of Derry Airport .

"An inventor whose life was saved thanks to his cycling helmet has developed the world's first flat-folding hat so people no longer have an excuse not to carry the protective headgear. Thanks to the introduction of Boris Bikes in London and people inspired by Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome's victories in the Tour De France, cycling is a booming sport. But while it's good for your health and can help commuters get to work faster on gridlocked roads, many are risking a serious injury - or death - by hopping onto the saddle without wearing a helmet. Ingenious: Inventor Jeff Woolf OBE has created the Morpher Helmet that can fold in half . Flattened: The helmet offers a solution for people who find the traditional headgear too bulky to carry around . It's a lesson inventor Jeff Woolf learnt the hard way after he was involved in a hit and run whilst cycling in West Hampstead, London, in his thirties. The 54-year-old from London told MailOnline: 'If I wasn't wearing a helmet than I might not still be here today. A car smashed into me while I was cycling and I hit the kerb. I broke my shoulder and ribs but my helmet took the brunt of the fall. If I hadn't been wearing it, I could have been brain-damaged or killed.' The accident made Woolf realise how important wearing a helmet is - yet he's been shocked to see so many people hiring Boris Bikes across the capital and riding off without wearing a protective hat. Portable: When folded in half, the helmet can easily fit into handbags and laptop cases . He researched the matter and discovered that almost 20,000 cycling accidents occur every year in the UK, yet a huge percentage of cyclists still don't wear helmets. In London alone, 93 per cent of people who hire bicycles don't wear helmets and, of those with their own bicycles, more than a quarter (26 per cent) don't wear them. He also found a report from the U.S. that discovered more than 90 per cent of cycling fatalities there happened to riders who are not wearing a helmet. Many of those who ride without one say they do so because they find traditional cycling helmets are too bulky to carry around. Step-by-step: The helmet flattens down so people have no excuse not to take it with them . So Woolf, who has an OBE for his services to innovation and has twice been named British Inventor of the Year, has come up with an ingenious solution. He has invented the Morpher Helmet that can be flattened and folded in half so it fits into your bag. Woolf said the product, that weighs around 250g, can easily fit into a handbag, rucksack or laptop case. The helmet is made from EPS - expanded polystyrene - that's rigid and tough enough to make it strong to protect heads from impact. But the inclusion of other plastics and nylon hinges means it can also be folded up. Dangerous: Woolf was alarmed by the number of people he's seen riding around London on Boris bikes without wearing a helmet . The technology has been patented worldwide and is currently in production with the aim of going on sale next Spring. A number of leading cycling retailers in Britain and the U.S. have expressed an interest in selling the product, that is estimated to cost around £60. Woolf said he's delighted his vision for a life-saving helmet is coming to fruition citing it as the 'best invention' he's had in his long and successful career. He explained: 'Some years ago, I survived a horrific cycling accident. My helmet saved my life. Since then I have been aware of the increasingly large number of cyclists taking to the streets without helmets and, with my experience in inventing, I wanted to see if I could help to reverse this trend. 'With more and more people riding every day, Morpher helmets will help to protect cyclists and save lives around the world.'

"From Miranda Kerr and Gisele Bundchen to Hilaria Baldwin, celebrity yoga selfies have become as commonplace as controversial tweets and paparazzi upskirt shots. But this new cultural stalwart is drawing ire from the yoga community, which claims that these celebrity yoga snaps are nothing more than a publicity stunt and do little to promote the ideals of the ancient practice. Jennilyn Carson, a New York-based yogi who runs a site called Yoga-Dork, told the New York Post: ‘In a sense it mocks what yoga is.’ Dangerous message? Hilaria Baldwin posted this controversial image on Instagram on Friday afternoon, writing: 'My intention is to promote health and encourage you to care for your body. #yogapostureoftheday' Supermodel devotee: The fastest yoga participation growth period in the U.S. was between 2008 and 2013, which saw a 29per cent increase, and today, an estimated 20.4 Americans practice yoga.

Striking controvery: Hilaria Baldwin's shalabhasana is one of the many celebrity yoga pose photos to draw ire from the yoga community . Mrs . Baldwin has spoken out in defence of her yoga photos, arguing that such . 'harsh judgments' make for the most un-yogic behavior possible. She . wrote on Twitter: 'True yogis dont make harsh judgements. So my advice . to the haters: get on your yoga mat & breath & feel, until you . make peace with diversity. [sic]' Mrs Baldwin, however, is not alone in fielding criticism from the yoga community. Taking flight: Lea Michele (pictured) is a serious yogi too and is pictured here in an acroyoga position .

"Just five months after giving birth to her first child, a girl named Mary-Jane, Catherine Tyler stepped onto the stage at one of Australia's biggest bodybuilding competitions. With washboard abs and a muscular physique that turned heads there were no signs that the 31-year-old had only ten weeks to prepare for the event many others spent the year training for. 'It was so rewarding and so empowering that I was in control of my body and control of my appearance,' Ms Tyler told Daily Mail Australia. Sydney mum Catherine Tyler (pictured left a few days before giving birth) competed in a bodybuilding competition just five months after the arrival of her first child (she is pictured right four weeks after birth) Ms Tyler trained with weights until she was eight-and-a-half months pregnant and did cardio until the day before she gave birth . The 31-year-old was trained by her partner Kevin (centre), a bodybuilder and personal trainer, and the pair originally met on a blind date at the gym . An avid lover of all things health and fitness, the 31-year-old from Sydney trained with weights until she was eight-and-a-half months pregnant, and was doing cardio up until the day before she gave birth. Also during her pregnancy, which left her with severe morning sickness, Ms Tyler made the decision that once she gave birth she would be 'back better than ever'. 'I've always had an interest in health and fitness but once I became pregnant I had this crazy idea that I could bounce back and I could come back better than ever,' she said. With her partner Kevin as her trainer, Ms Tyler got moving from the moment she gave birth - walking up to 5 kilometres most days while pushing her baby in the pram. 'Because I had kept training through the pregnancy my body just pinged back,' she revealed. The 31-year-old (second from right) said she's always had an interest in health and fitness . During her pregnancy she made the decision she would be 'back and better than ever' after giving birth . Ms Tyler said because she trained throughout her pregnancy, her body simply 'pinged' back into shape . In just ten weeks the first-time mum was at her fittest ever and competition ready, competing in the  IFBB NSW and National championships in the novice bikini division. But her transformation didn't come without a barrage of criticism. 'It’s been horrible,' Ms Tyler revealed. 'A lot of women are very defensive or negative and they often imply that I leave my baby to spend all my time in the gym, when I actually do a lot of my exercise with my baby. 'Or that I’m self-obsessed. I think a lot of women take it as a personal attack on them. 'It’s a bit hurtful but mothering is so competitive and there’s often a lot of conflict with other women over what you should feed your baby and things like that,' she continued. 'I’m just so proud of what I've achieved.' Ms Tyler also revealed she didn't want to take any shortcuts when she decided to enter a competition, and insists the program she followed and continues to live by is totally achievable for anyone. She insists the program she followed and continues to live by is totally achievable for anyone . She only visits the gym a few times a week and incorporates cardio into her week . Ms Tyler credits her strict diet for most of her success . 'I competed in an open division in bikini novice; I didn't want to do one of those bikini mother competitions,' she said. Breakfast: Water and 1 scoop of low carb protein shake with 3 weetabix . Post training: Protein shake or 1 serve of Gentec Cassein custard (perfect for sweet cravings). 270 calories . 4 meals a day consisting of: 50g protein which was either lean cuts of lamb, chicken or steak. 100g carbohydrates (dropping to 80g for the 2 remaining weeks before the comp) with can be a choice of sweet potato, brown rice or quinoa. 120g raw veggies (increasing to 150g for the 2 weeks prior to competing) consisting of finely chopped broccoli, red and white cabbage, baby spinach, celery and carrot. 'It was important to me that I didn't get any special consideration because I had just given birth.' 'I was just so proud and to be able to take part and to be competitive against other girls who had been training for a year, really I only had ten weeks to get ready,' she added. Another reason she was so insistent on keeping incredibly fit and healthy both during and after her pregnancy was because she's 'seen the toll pregnancy has taken on other women's bodies.' As a cosmetic nurse she has treated 'stretch marks and sagging skin' on many women whose bodies were irreversibly changed by child birth. 'Stretch marks are caused by rapid weight gain, some people are just more predisposed to it,' Ms Tyler said. 'But certainly for me it was just a matter of prioritising my time. She insists that the results she achieved under the guidance of partner Kevin - who has been a bodybuilder for 20 years and a personal trainer for 15 - are achievable for anyone. The 31-year-old (second from left) achieved the results under her partner Kevin, a person trainer . 'It was 90 per cent diet, people eat so much processed food it’s so detrimental to your health,' Ms Tyler said . 'I wasn't in the gym for like 20 hours a week... Two or three hours a week was all I spent in the gym,' she revealed. 'It was 90 per cent diet, people eat so much processed food it’s so detrimental to your health,' Ms Tyler added. Cardio: Walking five kilometres with the pram each day. And additional three cardio sessions are done at the gym each week. Weights: Four times a week at the gym alternating between a session of legs and glutes, and arms and back . Her top tips for mums who want to keep in shape both during and after pregnancy is not to eat for two the entire way through. 'The main thing is to be sensible with your eating during pregnancy,' Ms Tyler advised. 'Once you’ve caused the damage you can’t fix it and a lot of women go crazy with food. 'I mean I had some terrible cravings but really you just need to eat sensibly,' she added. Speaking to people who criticise her thinking she has a strict routine and neglects her child for exercise, Ms Tyler said she simply knows how to manage her time better. She juggled a masters degree with work and placement at a hospital two hours from her house while she was pregnant.

The fit mum has now set her sights on more competitions, and hopes that other mums can take what she's learned and incorporate it into their own lives. 'I generally manage three visits a week to the gym for cardio last thing at night when Kevin comes home from work,' she said. 'I alternate my training sessions between legs and glutes one session then arms and back. 'During the day I will normally walk for at least an hour a day with the pram. 'The key to my training is to focus on what you can do rather than compare yourself to others. My diet, whilst strict is very easy to follow and affordable,' Ms Tyler said.","Catherine Tyler competed in a bodybuilding competition last October .

"Warning: Dame Julie, the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, claimed some elderly patients are starving on wards and are being treated without dignity . Tens of thousands of elderly patients are enduring appalling NHS care because they are too frightened – or too polite – to complain. They suffer in silence fearing even worse treatment if they dare to raise criticism, England’s health watchdog Dame Julie Mellor warned. She said she had investigated cases of pensioners being effectively starved on wards and treated without a shred of dignity. But these, she believes, are just the tip of the iceberg because many over-65s are reluctant to complain. She said: ‘Often older people fear negative repercussions when they make a complaint, or they simply don’t like to “make a fuss”.’ Dame Julie, the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, said this fear prevents the health service learning from mistakes. While pensioners receive around half of all NHS care, just a third of complaints to her office come from the elderly – indicating their voices are not being heard. The damning comments from such a high-profile figure are significant because they indicate that, despite all the reforms announced after the Mid Staffordshire scandal, little has changed. The Daily Mail has highlighted the failure of the health service to listen effectively  to patients as part of its Dignity for the Elderly campaign. Now the ombudsman has demanded a ‘significant cultural shift’ in the way complaints are handled. She believes a single body should handle all complaints about health, social care and other services. She said: ‘Only with a significant changein attitudes towards complaints and a drive to reforming the complaints system will the NHS make the improvements it needs.’ Under the present system, people must complain to the offending trust first, and only if they are dissatisfied can they contact the ombudsman. Despite being the last port of call for complaints, Dame Julie receives around 16,000 every year. Of 904 NHS cases she investigated between April and December last year, 222 concerned the elderly. No fuss: While pensioners receive around half of all NHS care, just a third of complaints to her office come from the elderly - indicating their voices are not being heard (file picture) She said: ‘There are common themes running through complaints about the care of older people. Misdiagnosis, staff attitudes, poor communication with patients and families, substandard nutrition, and patients not being treated with  dignity, just to name a few.’ One older man with Alzheimer’s and diabetes was prevented from going home to die beside the brother he had lived with his whole life. This, she said, was the result of a ‘string of errors by five organisations across health and social care’. ‘They left it a month before they had a meeting about his care, by which time he’d passed away without his dying wish being honoured.’ In another case, a hospital did not consult the family on a decision not to resuscitate and in a third, staff switched off a patient’s life support against a family’s express wishes.  Research by Dame Julie’s organisation found that a quarter of older people don’t know how to complain. ‘Complaints are a gift to the NHS because that is how improvements are achieved,’ she said. Reform: She believes a single body should handle all complaints about the NHS, social care and other services . ‘Older people should be encouraged to complain and should be taken seriously when they do. But my fear is that too many older people are suffering in silence.’ We may be ‘seeing the tip of the iceberg’, she said, calling for a new  single Public Ombudsman Service. ‘People need and deserve a joined-up complaints system so they only need to raise their complaint once and so it can be dealt with by the same person,’ she said. Caroline Abrahams, director of the charity Age UK, said: ‘It is not acceptable for any patient not to receive adequate nutrition or hydration, not to have their personal hygiene attended to, and not to be treated with basic dignity and respect. ‘Preventing abuse and neglectful care must be a priority for the NHS . . . We see some moves to improve complaints processes and listen to feedback from older people, but we need to go much further and faster.’ If you feel your complaint has been dealt with unfairly by the NHS in England, contact www.ombudsman.org.uk. By JULIE MELLOR, HEALTH SERVICE OMBUDSMAN . Older people are some of the most frequent users of the NHS but they are less likely to complain about treatment and care when standards slip to unacceptable levels. Our research shows that a quarter of older people don’t know where to go to complain about the NHS, despite using the service more often than people under 65. Complaints are a gift to the NHS because that is how improvements are achieved. Older people should be encouraged to complain and taken seriously when they do. Problems: Many elderly patients do not complain about conditions because they do not want to make a fuss (file picture) But my fear is that too many older people are suffering in silence. Almost 80 per cent of all the investigations we carry out are about NHS services. Even though nearly half of NHS care and services are given to older people, only a third of the health complaints we investigate are about the care of older people. The Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman is the final step for people who have been treated unfairly or received a poor service from the NHS in England, or a government department or agency. Our role is to investigate complaints without taking sides and make recommendations to put things right. But older people’s reluctance to complain, coupled with their not knowing where to go to make a complaint, could mean we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg of serious failings in the care of people who are 65 and over. Of the cases we do see, there are common themes running through complaints about the care of older people. Misdiagnosis, staff attitudes, poor communication with patients and families, substandard nutrition, and patients not being treated with dignity, just to name a few. Small proportion: Of 904 NHS cases Dame Julie  investigated between April and December last year, 222 concerned the elderly . We believe there still needs to be a significant cultural shift in the way complaints are handled across the health and social care  system. More needs to be done to tackle the toxic cocktail of reluctance by patients, carers and families to complain, and a defensive response from the NHS when they do. Making a complaint should be easy and transparent. Often older people fear negative repercussions when they make a complaint, or they simply don’t like to ‘make a fuss’. But complaining can make a difference and often people tell us they made a complaint because they don’t want the same thing happening to somebody else. If people aren’t satisfied with the way the complaint has been handled by the NHS, then they can make a complaint to us, the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman. We know older people often rely on both NHS and social services and our joint investigations of treatment and care failings, with the Local Government Ombudsman, have highlighted the heartbreaking consequences when older people fall through the gaps between health and social care services. People deserve a joined-up complaints system so they only need to raise their complaint once and so it can be dealt with by the same  person throughout. And that’s why we want a single Public Ombudsman Service for England and the United Kingdom, which puts people at the centre of the complaints process, to be responsible for all complaints concerning public services, including health and social care. Only with a significant change in attitudes towards complaints and a drive to reform will the NHS make the improvements it needs to ensure all older people are treated with dignity and respect.","Dame Julie Mellor said elderly patients were starving on wards .

"Eddie Ray Routh shot dead Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle and his friend because he thought they were pig-human hybrids who were going to assassinate him, a mental health expert has testified. On Thursday, Mitchell H. Dunn, a forensic psychiatrist for the defense, testified in Routh's murder trial in Stephenville, Texas that the former Marine had shown 'significant signs of psychosis' before the killings at a shooting range in February 2013. Routh feared pig-human hybrids were taking over the world - and when he climbed into Kyle's car on the day of the shootings, he feared they were also pigs, Dunn said. He believed he was climbing inside the vehicle for a 'one-way trip', the court heard. Accused: Eddie Ray Routh, pictured on Thursday, is accused of killing Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle and his friend at a shooting range in 2013, but his attorneys say he was in a state of psychosis at the time . His fear intensified when the men did not speak to him in the car and when Kyle's friend, Chad Littlefield, did not shoot at the gun range. Thinking he was acting in self-defense, he shot the two men and felt relief afterwards, Dunn said. 'He said he thought he had neutralized the threat,' Dunn said, but added that Routh told him: 'As soon as I did it, I realized I made a mistake.' Dunn said that he does not think Routh knew what he was doing was wrong at the time because he was suffering from schizophrenia. Routh's defense team is trying to prove the 27-year-old was in a psychotic state when he gunned down Kyle and Littlefield after they took him to the gun range in 2013. He has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity - but the prosecution claims he acted knowingly after smoking marijuana and consuming alcohol on the morning of the killings. Expert: Psychiatrist Dr Mitchell H. Dunn testified on Thursday that Routh was having delusions, including that his colleagues were going to eat him and that his neighbor was in the Mexican mafia . Dunn, a forensic psychiatrist at Terrell State Hospital who interviewed Routh for more than six hours last April, explained that tests revealed the former Marine was showing signs of psychosis, including delusions, before the murders, and that he does not think it was related to substance abuse. He described Routh's belief that he was surrounded by half-pig, half-human hybrids. He 'believed pigs were taking over the earth,' before the killings, Dunn said. Among them were his colleagues at a cabinet shop, who he believed wanted to roast him with the space heater at work and then eat him, he said. He also believed his girlfriend, Jennifer Weed, was also becoming a pig-human hybrid, the psychiatrist added. When he saw her eat bacon, he was shocked. 'He was thinking she was a pig hybrid. Why would you eat the flesh of your people?' Dunn explained, according to the Dallas Morning News. And after he arrived in jail, he believed people were going to cook him and eat him, Dunn said. Dunn also listed Routh's multiple stints to psychiatric hospitals, starting in July 2011. 'It was clear that he was psychotic,' Dunn told the court. 'There was no question about that.' Questioning: Eddie Ray Routh's former girlfriend Jennifer Weed, pictured, testified on Wednesday. She recalled his increasingly erratic behavior in the months before the killings and how she would care for him . Together: The former couple, who became engaged the night before the slayings, are seen together in an evidence photo shown in court on Thursday. They met on a dating website in 2012 . Fear: Laura Blevins, the sister of Eddie Ray Routh, is pictured on the stand in his murder trial on Wednesday. She recounted how he came to her home in February 2013 and admitted to killing two men . When he was hospitalized again the following year, he had bipolar disorder and a major depressive disorder with major psychotic features, and heavily used alcohol and cannabis. His testimony came after state district Judge Jason Cashon agreed to prosecutors' request to disqualify Dr Charles Overstreet as an expert witness for the defense after he said he does not have a physician's license. Earlier this week, the jury heard Routh's mother, sister, brother-in-law and ex-girlfriend recall his fragile mental state after returning from service in Haiti and Iraq. On the witness stand, his former girlfriend Jennifer Weed recalled how he once grabbed a ninja sword to protect them from people who 'were out to get them' and accused her of being a demon and trying to steal his soul. On another occasion, she went to see him at the request of his concerned uncle. 'He was visibly upset,' she said of Routh. 'Staring at the wall most of the time, then would break into tears and then laughter. Then he would go back to staring.' Weed described how she would take care of Routh, helping him take his medication and even bathing him because he would refuse to wash himself for weeks . Victims: Chris Kyle, left, and Chad Littlefield, right, were both shot multiple times on February 2, 2013 . Former life: Routh, pictured with his mother, was a Marine who served in Iraq and Haiti after the earthquake . On the night before he murdered the two men, she went to get his medication when he knelt down and proposed to her. She said yes and they hugged and cried, she said. But the next morning, they fought over his smoking, she said. 'F*** you, go eat a peanut and die,' he told his girlfriend, who is allergic to peanuts. She left, but called his uncle to come over because she did not want him to be alone. His sister and brother-in-law testified about similarly bizarre behavior on Wednesday. Laura Blevins said her brother drove to her house in Kyle's stolen truck after killing him and Littlefield at a shooting range in 2013 but was 'not all there'. 'The man who was my brother was not at my house,' Mrs Blevins told the court. 'When I was looking at him, he kind of looked like he was out of it, almost in a daze or something.' Her husband Gaines Blevins added: 'He said he took their souls before they could take his. I asked him what he meant by that, and he said they were out to get him.' Kyle, whose story has appeared across movie theaters in 'American Sniper', had taken Routh to the shooting range after Routh's mother contacted him, asking him to help her son, who had PTSD. The court has also heard how he smoked marijuana and may have consumed whiskey before heading to the shooting range with Kyle and Littlefield, but voluntary intoxication is not a defense. In court: Chris Kyle's widow, Taya Kyle, can be seen wearing his dog tags to court on Thursday . A Texas Ranger testified that authorities also found anti-psychotic medication for schizophrenia while searching Routh's home after the shooting. Last week, a former deputy testified that he overheard Routh after he'd been taken into custody say that he shot the men because they wouldn't talk to him as the three drove together to the shooting range. The court also heard this week how Routh became irritated when Littlefield was not shooting. 'Are you gonna shoot? Are you gonna shoot? It's a shooting sport. You shoot,' Routh said in a phone call to a New Yorker reporter after the killings. 'That's what got me all riled up.' In his taped confession, he also said he was fearful that if he didn't shoot the men, whom he called 'headhunters', then they would turn on him. 'If I didn't take out his soul, he was going to take my soul next,' Routh said. The trial has drawn intense interest, partly because of an Oscar-nominated film based on Kyle's memoir.","Eddie Ray Routh, 27, is on trial for shooting dead Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield at a Texas gun range in February 2013 .

"A bevy of celebrities are hosting a pricey fundraiser for President Obama Monday night at the Connecticut home of famed producer Harvey Weinstein and his fashion designer wife Georgina Chapman. Though the President is often criticised over his close connections to Hollywood, he is facing more of a firestorm over the location of the dinner. Two popular Westport, Connecticut beaches will be closed this evening so that the President's helicopter can park on the grounds when it arrives for the fundraiser. Commotion over closing: The Sherwood Island Beach in Westport, Connecticut was closed Monday night because the President's helicopter was due to land there so he could attend a fundraiser nearby . En route: President Obama landed at New York's JFK airport before flying to Connecticut by helicopter for the evening . Presidential parking: Mr Obama's motorcade is seen arriving at Weinstein's house . FoxNews.com reports that both the 238-acre Sherwood Island State Park and the 2-acre Burying Hill Beach will be closed to accommodate the White House's needs. Burying Hill Beach is directly next to the Weinstein property. 'This is the height of hypocrisy,' Republican Connecticut state legislator Lawrence F. Cafero Jr. told the site. 'Can you imagine if George W. Bush in 2004 had requested that our Republican governor shut down the park? It would have made national news. This is wrong in so many ways.' The closure of the park- while likely based on security issues- angered a number of Tea Party supporters gathered in protest of the President's visit. Famous friends: Producer Harvey Weinstein and his fashion designer wife Georgina Chapman, seen here at a White House event in March, are hosting the expensive dinner at their Connecticut home Monday night . Fashionable funder: Vogue editor Anna Wintour, seen here at White House event in January, is a co-host of the dinner . 'It was a little bit selfish of the . President. Big ego, ""I need this park."" He couldn't find a better place . to park? Maybe he needs to drive a little farther?' protester Mark . Conrad told The Hartford Courant. 'There's very little tourism in Connecticut and this is one of the big locations, and he says ""It's mine today.""' In addition to Weinstein and Chapman, Bloomberg News reports that the dinner for 60 people will be co-hosted by actress Anne Hathaway, screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, and Vogue editor Anna Wintour. While the entire guest list is not known explicitly, legendary actor Paul Newman's widow Joanne Woodward- who lives in Westport- is expected to be one of the attendees who ponied up $38,500 for a ticket. Before tucking into the dinner, Mr Obama will be speaking at a larger fundraiser at the Stamford, Connecticut Marriott. Up to 500 people will be in attendance and those tickets begin at $500-per-person. In total, the evening is expected to bring in $2.5million for the President's re-election campaign, which comes the same day as July fundraising totals were released to show that Mr Obama is trailing his Republican opponent by a significant margin. For the third month in a row, Mitt Romney raised more money than the sitting President, bringing in $101million last month. Mr Obama's campaign and the Democratic National Committee raised $75milion. Though such sums are nothing to be laughed at, the pace at which Mr Romney is outraising Mr Obama comes as a surprise given his success during the 2008 campaign. Star support: Actress Anne Hathaway (left) and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (right), seen at two different Democratic events, are also headlining the dinner . The Associated Press reports that Mr . Romney's fundraising success this summer was the first time that Mr . Obama was outraised by a competitor since 2007. In spite of emailed pleas for continued . donations by the President himself, Democratic advisors and supporters . are not overly concerned about the spending differentials. Consultants told the newswire that if anything, the fact that Mr Romney's camp is outraising Mr Obama's campaign simply means that Mr Obama will have to rely more heavily on the fundraising powers of surrogates while he continues the daily work at the White House. In the final monts before the election, he will likely focus more time on large events and rallies where his presence can be more easily viewed. Raking it in: Mitt Romney, who is currently at his home in New Hampshire, outraised Mr Obama for the third month in a row, bringing in $101million in July . Bumpy ride: In spite of the public outrage over the event, Mr Obama's campaign is expected to raise $2.5million from the evening's line up . Former President Bill Clinton, also known for his fundraising finesse, will host a campaign event in New York next week, and First Lady Michelle Obama will host a number of fundraisers on behalf of her husband including one this weekend at the Hollywood home of No Doubt lead singer Gwen Stefani. While Mr Obama has significantly more famous friends than Mr Romney- Bloomberg reports that $3.2million has been raised for the President by donors in the film and music industries- Mr Romney did get verbal endorsement by actor Clint Eastwood and former porn star Jenna Jameson over the weekend. No word yet on how much those two endorsements raised for the Republican campaign. During the dinner, President Obama took a moment to thank the various hosts who headlined the Connecticut dinner. These are his remarks: . Thank you, everybody. Well, it is wonderful to be here. And there are just a couple of people I want to acknowledge. First of all, obviously Harvey and Georgina have just been great friends and have done so much for us -- not just in this election, but in the previous one. A couple of other people who I want to mention -- your Governor, Dan Malloy, is here, who's doing outstanding work here in Connecticut. I want to thank Anne Hathaway for taking the time to host us. She's spectacular. And I did get a chance to see Batman. And she was the best thing in it. That's just my personal opinion. Aaron Sorkin, who writes the way every Democrat in Washington wished they spoke. Aaron, thank you. And Joanne Woodward -- what a treat this is. Joanne and Paul were not only I think what was best about American film, but also just embodied the American spirit in so many ways. And their love story and the way they took so many people under their wing and helped so many people I think made them something more important than just folks in film. And for her to be here, what a great treat that is. So thank you so much for taking the time. Thank you.","Famed Hollywood producer scheduled a 60-person dinner at his Westport, Connecticut home for the President that cost $38,500-per-plate .

"Three state troopers have testified in the murder trial of former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez about evidence they recovered. The former NFL star is charged in the June 2013 death of Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancée. Trooper Zachary Johnson testified on Thursday about going to Lloyd's home in Massachusetts on the evening his body was found and alerting his family that he was dead. He also spoke about a safe that police found in the closet of Hernandez's master bedroom at his home in North Attlenoro. Inside, he said, was a digital scale and a dish with what he said was marijuana residue. Scroll down for video . Former NFL player Aaron Hernandez looks back at the gallery during his murder trial at the Bristol County Superior Court in Fall River, Massachusetts on Thursday . Azia Jenkins, uncle to Shaneah and Shayanna Jenkins, points to the defendant during the murder trial for former NFL player Aaron Hernandez on Wednesday. Mr Jenkins said Hernandez was worried about his endorsement deals following his arrest in connection to Odin Lloyd's murder . Another trooper spoke at length about how he recovered video surveillance from Hernandez's home. Hernandez's lawyers have tried to poke holes in the state's case by going after how police handled evidence. On Wednesday, jurors heard from Azia Jenkins, uncle of Hernandez's fiancée Shayanna Jenkins, who said the football player matter-of-factly told people that his endorsement days were over a day after Odin Lloyd's killing. Mr Jenkins was called to the stand in Hernandez's murder trial by prosecutor William McCauley, who asked him what happened on June 18, 2013. Odin Lloyd's body had been found the day before in an industrial park not far from Hernandez's home in North Attleboro. Lloyd had been dating Shaneah Jenkins, the sister of Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna. Azia Jenkins testified that Shayanna had called him that morning asking him to come from Connecticut to pick up another uncle, Donnie Smith. Smith and Shaneah Jenkins had gone to Hernandez's home that morning after Shaneah had been told by police that Lloyd was dead. Azia Jenkins said he had arrived at the Hernandez home that afternoon and was preparing to leave when police arrived and spoke with him in the driveway. He said he went to the police station, then returned to the Hernandez home. Upon his return, he said, Hernandez wanted to know what police had asked him. After a brief conversation, Jenkins, Hernandez and Smith went to the basement to play pool and watch Game 6 of the NBA Finals. A commercial came on, Jenkins said. 'Aaron said, ''My endorsements are gone,''' Mr Jenkins testified. He said that Hernandez didn't elaborate and that he appeared 'cool, calm, collected'. At the time of the slaying, Hernandez had a $40 million contract with the Patriots and an endorsement deal with CytoSport, the company that makes Muscle Milk. He also had a two-year contract with the sportswear company Puma. He was arrested in Lloyd's murder on June 26 and cut by the Patriots soon after. Enterprise worker Keelia Smyth told Bristol County Superior Court on Wednesday about allegedly finding a bullet in the car . 'Evidence': This is a picture shown to the court on Wednesday of the casing police recovered on June 20 . Also Wednesday, Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh ruled that prosecutors may not call to the stand Hernandez's high school friend Robert Paradis. Paradis testified when the jury was out of the courtroom that he had visited Hernandez in April 2013 at his condo in Los Angeles. He said Hernandez told him he kept 'fire' or 'heat' under the seat of his car and indicated it was a .45-caliber weapon, the same as the murder weapon, which has never been found. Paradis said that after Hernandez left the condo, Hernandez called back to ask him to check whether he had left 'it' in his bedroom. Paradis opened a drawer, saw a black shirt wrapped around an object and lifted it up but never opened it. He said it felt like a gun. The judge said Paradis' statements were inconsistent and would be prejudicial. The court also heard on Wednesday from Keelia Smyth, former manager of an Enterprise rental car branch in North Attleboro. Ms Smyth told the court that Hernandez returned a damaged Nissan Altima on the afternoon of June 17, 2013. In it, she said, was something she believed to be a bullet stuck to a piece of chewed blue gum and a child's drawing. Hernandez had offered her a piece of blue gum before he left, she said. Enterprise worker Keelia Smyth said Hernandez returned a damaged Nissan Altima asking for an SUV on June 18, 2013 .","The former Pats player is charged in the June 2013 death of Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancée .

"The Health and Human Services Department is considering the launch of a special enrollment period for an estimated six million people who did not sign up for health care insurance coverage by the 2015 deadline. 'We're going to analyze it, we're going to think about it,and we'll be back. And we will be back quickly on it,' HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell told reporters on Wednesday and said she'd make a decision by next Friday. Democratic lawmakers and their allies have been lobbying HHS to give Americans without healthcare insurance until the end of the April tax season to submit their applications, arguing that many Americans are unaware of the consequences of not signing up. Obamacare enrollees receive assistance applying for medical coverage at a health insurance marketplace enrollment center in Orlando, Florida, on Sunday, which was to be the last day to sign up for 2015 coverage under the Affordable Care Act, until the Health and Human Services department delayed the deadline for some Americans on Monday . And now HHS is considering the launch of a special enrollment period for the estimated six million people who did not sign up for health care insurance coverage by the Feb. 15 deadline . For the 2014 tax year, residents without health insurance will have to pay $95 to get out of the requirement, or 1 percent of their income, when they file their returns. The fine will increase to the greater of $395 or 2 percent of a household's income next year at filing time for anyone who missed the open enrollment period this month. 'Millions upon millions of people are unaware about these penalties,' Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a left-aligned group that advocated for Obamacare, said Wednesday, per the Hill. HHS has already extended the deadline to enroll for approximately 150,000 people 'in line' to sign up but were prevented from completing their applications by a computer glitch or long wait times at call centers last weekend. Those enrollees will have until Feb. 22 to fill out their forms, HHS said Monday. Some states have postponed the close of the 2015 open enrollment for a variety of reasons, and several others have indicated that they are considering the authorization of a special enrollment period that would extend until the end of April. Washington and Minnesota have announced grace periods. California, New York and Kentucky may do the same. Congressional Democrats say all Americans should be afforded the opportunity to sign up for Obamcare late, and they urged HHS this week to grant their request for a nationwide special enrollment period. Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin and nine other Democratic senators sent a letter to the administration asking for leniency while House Democrats  Sandy Levin of Michigan, the ranking member on the Ways and Means Committee, Jim McDermott of Washington and Lloyd Doggett of Texas co-authored another. 'We're going to analyze it, we're going to think about it,and we'll be back. And we will be back quickly on it,' Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia  Burwell said of the possibility of a special enrollment period on Wednesday . The Treasury Department in January estimated that as many as six million Americans without health coverage would not meet the government-mandated Feb. 15 to sign up for Obamacare. That was before HHS announced on Tuesday that it had vastly exceeded its own expectations and signed up 11.4 million Americans for health insurance from Nov. 15 through Sunday. 'Sunday, February 15 was the biggest enrollment day ever: more new consumers signed up for health coverage than on any day this open enrollment period or the last,' the White House said in a statement, noting that one million Americans enrolled in the final nine days. HHS had predicted that 9.9 million people would meet the deadline. The Congressional Budget Office was far more aggressive with its assessment. The non-partisan agency said it expected 13 million Americans to come forward in that amount of time. If HHS reopens the federal exchange, it could reach that mark.","The end of the open enrollment period was Feb. 15 - anyone without out health insurance who didn't sign up then will slapped with a tax next year .

"Starting from humble beginnings in a building with just five pupils, City Montessori school in India is now the world's largest - with a staggering 47,000 attendees. It is so large a packed Anfield football stadium could comfortably attend - with room to spare. The school, known as CMS, employs an army of 3,800 staff, including teachers, support staff, cleaners, rickshaw drivers, and even electricians, carpenters and gardeners. Scroll down for video . Record breaking: City Montessori School, in India is the world's largest with 47,0000 students, but they still have room to congregate outside for morning prayers . It has over 1,000 classrooms, 3,700 computers and goes through thousands of pounds worth of stationary and books each year. Based in the city of Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh, CMS was set up by Dr Jagdish Gandhi, 75, and his wife Bharti in 1959 with just five pupils. Today, it sprawls over 20 campuses across the city - and is still growing despite more than doubling in size during the last 14-years alone. Dr. Gandhi said: 'I founded this school . with great difficulty back in 1959. I was beating the drum all around . the part of Lucknow that I live for 15 days but no one came. Dr Ghandi said: 'I believe that we should not deny children the right to education.' Dr Jagdish Gandhi, right, the co-founder of City Montessori School began in 1959 with just five pupils. Now, on average, classes contain 40 to 50 students and teachers say lessons work well with that number . 'It was only when me and my wife persuaded a woman to send the children from her extended family that it all started, and even then it was only five children. 'We started from very humble beginnings and back then we only had a loan of 300 rupees (£3 at current rates) to fund our school. 'But from word of mouth it slowly spread and children started coming. Year after year the numbers swelled. 'I never thought that one day we would have the world's biggest school. There are over 20 campuses around Lucknow and we are bigger than the population of many towns.' Dr. Jagdish Gandhi, 75, and his wife Bharti in 1959 with just five pupils. Today, it sprawls over 20 campuses across the city - and is still growing . The school's rapid growth saw it officially recognised by the 2013 Guinness Book of Records as the world's largest, taking the crown from Rizal High School in Manila, Philippines, which had just 19,738 pupils. Dr. Gandhi added: 'It was a proud moment for us when we were included in the record book. 'But since then we have kept growing - in the last 14 years the number has more than doubled from 22,000 . 'I believe that we should not deny children the right to education.' Workforce: CMS employs an army of 3,800 staff, including teachers, support staff, cleaners, rickshaw drivers, and even electricians, carpenters and gardeners . CMS's sheer size means it has never convened for an assembly - because there is no venue large enough to house them all. Geeta Kingdon, the current head teacher and daughter of founder Dr. Gandhi, said: 'The whole of Lucknow would be jammed if we tried because one bus holds 50 children, so we'd need 1,000 buses to bring them together.' The school receives no government funding, instead charging a relatively modest 1,000 rupees (£12) a month in fees for younger pupils, rising to £2,500 (£30) a month for seniors. Some of its past alumni have gone on to work for the United Nations, studied at Harvard and worked for Goldman Sachs. Current pupil Kanika Gupta, 14, of Class 9J, said: 'I could not imagine going to a smaller school. 'Being at the world's largest school means you get to make lots of friends and meet many different people, with different interests and tastes. Some of its past alumni have gone on to work for the United Nations, studied at Harvard and worked for Goldman Sachs . The school prides itself on its high values and ethics and teaches children how to be good citizens within the community . 'But there are challenges too - standing out ahead of your peers is difficult. You have to work twice as hard to make sure you get noticed, otherwise you are just another student among thousands of others.' Fellow pupil Harsh Rai, also 14, added: 'It is definitely competitive, particularly to get into the school teams. 'But if you make one then you can certainly feel proud of that because you are the creme of the crop.' He added: 'We are taught not only traditional subjects but good values. Dr. Gandhi is an inspiration for us all to be good citizens.' Class sizes range from 25 pupils all the way up to 50 in a single room. Each pupil is also assigned a teacher who is responsible for his or her pastoral care, something staff believe means no one gets neglected or forgotten. The school receives no government funding; children's parents are charged a low fee for their children to attend . Getting into a school team is a challenge with so many pupils but also means that they strive harder to achieve, one student said. Worship, right, is also an important part of daily school life . Miss Archana Mishra, who has taught English at CMS for the past six years, said: 'There is a good rapport between the students and the teachers. It is very easy to teach them and there are not many problems with them. 'We try and keep classes below 50 pupils, and generally they are usually around 40 to 45 pupils on average. We find this is a manageable number and everyone gets enough attention.' And with so many pupils, she admits it can be difficult avoiding students outside of school hours. Miss Mishra added: 'There are so many of them, particularly who live around my area, it can be difficult not to bump into them at the mall or in the street. 'Usually if we see each other, we both tend to ignore one another. We see enough of each other at school.' The world's largest school is in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. The school's population is greater than many towns in the country . Alongside traditional subjects such as Geography, Maths and English, students also learn about world peace. CMS is also the only school in the world to be awarded a UNESCO prize for its efforts in this field. Dr. Gandhi said: 'The education that we provide here at CMS is totally different from that of any other school in the world. 'We are not just teaching subjects but also the love of the world. The people of Lucknow have shown that they like our philosophy - that's why there is no space left and admissions are so sought after.'","Dr Jagdish Gandhi started the school in 1959 with only five pupils .

"A couple who took their children on a term-time holiday to Corfu after a 'traumatic' year have been dragged into court and fined £240. Roy and Jenny Davies pulled son Alistair, 14, and daughter Rhiannon, 13, out of school for a week so they could enjoy some much-needed 'quality time'. The holiday followed a stressful year in which a family member died and Mrs Davies underwent emergency surgery which left her unable to walk. While the family deemed their circumstances 'exceptional', Alistair's school did not agree, fining the parents £60. Roy and Jenny Davies were fined £240 for taking their children Alistair, 14, and Rhiannon, 13, out of school for a holiday to Corfu after a 'traumatic year' Mr and Mrs Davies, from Cheddar, refused to pay, leading Somerset County Council to prosecute the pair. Magistrates in Taunton, Somerset, said they 'sympathised' with the couple but imposed a fine of £240 plus costs - a total of £290. The true cost is likely to be far higher, with self-employed welder Mr Davies missing out on an estimated further £300 from two full days of work spent in court thanks to their original hearing being adjourned. The couple say they are furious at the way they have been treated by Alistair's school - Kings of Wessex Academy, in Cheddar - particularly as Rhiannon's school took no action over her absence. They decided to take the holiday after a traumatic 15 months. Three days after the funeral of Mr Davies' father, Mrs Davies was rushed to hospital with a cyst on one of her ovaries. An operation to remove it forced the mother-of-two to stop working as she spent 10 months on heavy painkillers - before having a further operation on her toe because of arthritis. Alistair's school imposed a fine on the Davies family for taking the holiday, which came after a death in the family and Mrs Davies undergoing emergency surgery . Mr Davies said: 'We needed quality time as a family as the children had a very dramatic 18 months. The children spent their summer holidays running around and fetching things for their mum. 'If we had been worried about their education, we would not have taken them out of school.' As a result of the crackdown on term-time absences imposed by former Education Secretary Michael Gove in September 2013, headteachers can no longer grant up to 10 days’ holiday a year. Instead, they can allow leave only in ‘exceptional circumstances’ Each parent who ignores a ban faces a £60 fine per child, rising to £120 if it is not paid within 21 days. Failure to pay the fine can result in prosecution, with a maximum fine – if convicted – of £2,500 or a jail sentence of up to three months. The move was intended to stop families damaging their children’s education by taking them away when holiday firms offer cheaper holidays. A quarter of primary schools have punished parents for ignoring bans. The couple booked a holiday to Corfu for October last year, which involved taking the children out of school for a week. Mrs Davies, 47, said: 'We wanted to take the holiday with the half term holidays, but it doubles in price. It's crazy.' Rhiannon's school, Fairlands Middle School in Cheddar,  raised no objection but Alistair's school warned they could face a fine. Alistair has good grades so the family thought his absence would not affect his long-term prospects. Mrs Davies said: 'My son was getting so stressed out on the holiday, worrying that he'd have so much work to catch up on. 'I told him we'd figure it out together. But he didn't get any extra homework or any work to help him to catch up.' When they returned home they were each slapped with £60 fines, which doubled to £120 each when they failed to pay within 21 days. Last week they appeared in the dock at Taunton Magistrates' Court in Somerset, where they both pleaded guilty. Mr Davies, 42, showed the court letters and postcards praising Alistair for his grades and hard work at the school. Magistrate Charis Cavaghan-Pack said she 'sympathised' with the family but it 'would not be in the interest of justice' to let them off. Alistair's school - Kings of Wessex Academy - imposed a £60 fine on the parents, who refused to pay . Rhiannon's school - Fairlands Middle School - accepted the family's exceptional circumstances and allowed the 13-year-old to have a week off . They were fined £240 - £120 per adult per child per week of absence - plus £30 costs and a £20 victim surcharge. After the hearing, Mrs Davies said: 'We think there were exceptional circumstances and while the school argued that it affected Alistair's grades, we proved it wasn't the case with several postcards and letters from the school. 'The court hasn't taken into consideration that Roy has lost two days of work as a self-employed welder and fabricator and work has been quiet the last few months. It's difficult.' A spokesman for Somerset County Council defended the decision to bring the case to court. 'When a case like this ends up in court it is the bench who decides on a verdict and appropriate sentence after considering all the evidence and any mitigating circumstances. 'We believe every child deserves the very best education and this is why we work closely with schools on attendance which in a small number of cases results in penalty notices being issued.' Neither school was available for comment this afternoon. Parents have campaigned for holiday prices to be slashed now legislation stops families from taking time off during term time. More than 170,000 people have signed a petition calling on the Government to force holiday companies to cut their prices, meaning it could be debated in Parliament. As many as two-fifths of parents would flout the rules so they can get a cheaper summer holiday, a poll found last year. One frustrated father Paul Cookson, 41, was inspired to speak out after trying to book a trip to Center Parcs with his seven-year-old daughter Phoebe. His Facebook rant  about perceived 'rip-off' prices went viral, with outraged parents sharing the post more than 143,000 times. ‘I think I’ve touched a nerve with this one,’ he said. ‘I don’t see why I should be penalised for sticking to the rules.’ Martin Dalby, from Centre Parcs, said: ‘What we are doing is flexible pricing,’ he says. ‘In the summer I could sell the place twice over and the prices reflect the high level of demand.’ He adds: ‘It’s best to see it as me dropping prices off-peak to stimulate demand.’","Roy and Jenny Davies took children out of school for a week's holiday .

"Even he admitted it was a dumb idea. But how Shaun Harrington escaped with his life after tackling a tiger shark with a $50 bird cage remains a mystery. In a heartstopping video, the 27-year-old is seen bobbing in the water clad just in bright green board shorts and holding the flimsy defence. Scroll down for video . Dumb: Shaun Harrington comes alarmingly close to the tiger shark which he attempted to fend off with a bird cage . He holds the bird cage to camera when an eight foot shark comes out of nowhere and charges right at him, narrowly missing the adrenalin junkie as he shields himself with the bird cage. ‘I just thought, “I gotta get out of here”,’ Mr Harrington said of the experience in an interview with Channel Nine’s Today. ‘I saw the shark coming and threw the budgie cage in front of it and it just bounced off it. I thought I would just jump in, get a couple of shots and hop out but the thing just went crazy. ‘It wigged out and came at me. It's probably one of the dumbest things I've ever done.’ Twin brothers Shaun and Dean were sitting in 1km deep waters off Snapper Rocks in Coolangatta when they decided to shoot the stunt. Mr Harrington jumped into the water with the shark that had been caught by a professional fisherman. He had originally intended to wear the bird cage on his head. Defence: The daredevil brandishes a $50 bird cage he hoped to use to fend off the creature . Attack: He hurls the flimsy cage at the shark as it moves in at ferocious speed, creating a splash . Close encounter: The swimmer looks deeply shocked as the shark passes alongside . No defence: Shaun seems proud of his impromptu shield as he prepares to tackle the challenge . The extreme video was shot for the brothers' surfing and fishing clothing label, The Mad Hueys, and mad they proved themselves to be as Mr Harrington came frightfully close to the giant man-eater just moments after diving in. In hindsight, Mr Harrington has admitted the stunt was, ‘not the smartest thing’ and said he now finds himself in trouble with his wife. ‘I'm pretty much in the dog house', he said. ‘I'm thinking of renovating (it) at the moment and putting a pool table in there,’ he said. The Harrington brothers bragged about their near miss in a comment posted below their YouTube video.

"A German nurse has expressed regret for killing up to 30 patients by giving them an overdose of heart medication. Nils H, 38, reportedly told Oldenburg regional court he brought about cardiac arrests in some 90 patients because he enjoyed the feeling of being able to resuscitate them. H, whose full name is withheld under German privacy laws, used Gilurytmal, a medication which should only be used by doctors under strict supervision, it was said. He claimed 30 of these patients died. Nils. H. (pictured left concealing his face as he arrives for his trial) is being tried for just three specimen murders by injecting patients with a dangerous medicine . Though H is facing charges in three murders and two attempted murders, the state prosecutor has said he could be involved in more than 150 deaths. Prosecutors in the district court of Oldenburg said he was bored and wanted to practice his 'excellent' resuscitation skills. They are seeking a life-sentence for the defendant. According to the prosecution, if the first attempt at resuscitation was a success, H. would sometimes make a second attempt. Side effects include an irregular heartbeat, a drop in blood pressure and uncoordinated functioning of the heart muscle. In cooperation with the police, the state prosecutor is currently investigating the deaths of 174 patients who died during H's shifts from 2003 to 2005 at a clinic in Delmenhorst, near Bremen. Prosecutors in the district court of Oldenburg said Nils. H. (pictured) was bored and wanted to practice his 'excellent' resuscitation skills. He reportedly 'expressed regret' for killing up to 30 patients . The investigators will also look into deaths at H.'s previous jobs in Oldenburg and Wilhelmshaven and dozens of bodies will have to be exhumed. In 2008, Nils H was previously sentenced to seven-and-a-half years for the attempted murder of another patient. He gave his patient an overdose of heart medication, though the man narrowly escaped death. The death rate in the Delmenhorst clinic nearly doubled in the time H. worked there, and use of the heart medication also increased dramatically. But it took nearly a decade before an investigation was launched, angering relatives of the dead who are demanding information. Though H. is facing charges in three murders and two attempted murders, the state prosecutor has said he could be involved in more than 150 deaths . A senior doctor who gave evidence in September said H was a 'passionate medic' who made a good impression on staff at the clinic. But the doctor added: 'I found it strange that he was always on hand when patients were being resuscitated, often helping younger doctors with intubation - inserting a breathing tube into a patient's airways.' 'No one wants to believe that a colleague would rather kill patients, instead of helping them,' said Erich Joester, a lawyer for the clinic. He said that the increased death rate had been attributed to a number of causes rather than a rogue individual.","Nils. H. told court he brought about cardiac arrests in 90 patients .

"In an effort to ensure global food security, 10,000 new varieties of crops from around the world are being added to the 'doomsday' seed vault in the Arctic. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault, on an island off Norway's northern coast, already stores 825,000 samples of seeds, which represent 13,000 years of agricultural history. The vault provides a back-up to the network of seed banks around the world, which store seeds but can be threatened by war, accidents and natural disasters. Scroll down for video . 10,000 varieties of crops are being added to the 'doomsday' seed vault in the Arctic to protect humanity . Protecting the diversity of the world's crops is 'fundamental' for ensuring food security in the face of climate change, warned the Global Crop Diversity Trust (GCDT), which manages the vault. A series of deliveries of seeds to Svalbard this month will help in that fight, the GCDT said. Four shipments from major genebanks based in Bulgaria, Colombia, India and Taiwan are delivering varieties from more than 100 countries. The shipments include types of wheat, barley, corn, sorghum, peal millet, chickpea, groundnut, Asian and African aubergine. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault, on an island off Norway's northern coast, already stores 825,000 samples of seeds which represent 13,000 years of agricultural history . The shipments include types of wheat (pictured), barley, corn,  peal millet, chickpea and groundnut . Seeds of a number of indigenous African vegetables, including okra, amaranth, spider plant and jute mallow are also being deposited. Preserving different food plant varieties will help breed and develop crops that can withstand a changing climate, for example, by being more drought resistant or able to cope with higher temperatures, the trust said. The Fertile Crescent is an ancient area of fertile soil arcing around the Arabian desert . Violent turmoil in the Middle East could indirectly lead to millions of people starving from food shortages, research suggests. Scientists have found that the highest concentration of wild crop plants needed to produce new food varieties lie in an area known as the Fertile Crescent. However, this area is also at the centre of a number of civil wars that are placing valuable crop species at risk of extinction. The Fertile Crescent is an ancient area of fertile soil arcing around the Arabian desert from Jordan, Palestine, Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey and ending in Iraq and Iran. It has the largest diversity of 'crop wild relatives' (CWRs) - species closely related to our crops which are needed to create future 'super crop' varieties. Given that the human population is set to expand from the 7.26 billion to 9.6 billion by 2050, CWRs will be needed to improve crop yields and feed the extra people. But researchers at Birmingham have shown that 12 per cent of CWRs are threatened with extinction and all are likely to be already suffering a loss of genetic diversity. Marie Haga, executive director of the Global Crop Diversity Trust, said: 'The Svalbard Global Seed Vault symbolises how we can create a long-term, sustainable and positive solution to feed the world forever. 'The issue of hunger is global, and increasingly urgent. If we continue as we are, food production will be reduced and food prices will rise. Even more people will go hungry. 'Crop diversity is essential if we are to provide more food, more nutritious food and affordable food for the poor. 'Maintaining crop diversity, and the genetic wealth it provides to current and future generations, is beneficial not just to crop breeders, but to the farmers that feed all of us on this planet.'

"Selfie lovers with a head for heights can now enjoy taking a hair-raising snap from the Eiffel Tower thanks to a new see-through floor. Paris’ top attraction officially unveiled the glass floor today as part of a £24m refit that allows visitors to feel as if they are walking on air nearly 200 feet above ground.

"Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino was disappointed with his side's 1-1 draw with Fiorentina in the Europa League and believes Spurs deserved more from their first-leg display at White Hart Lane. Roberto Soldado gave the hosts a dream start when he volleyed home a corner in the sixth minute but Jose Maria Basanta's equaliser secured Fiorentina a draw and a crucial away goal.

Today we were better than Fiorentina, especially in the first-half. 'We created a lot of chances but this is football. I think in the first-half we controlled the game but we had more of the ball in the second-half. 'In general, over the 90 minutes we were better.

"The pitch may have been artificial but there was nothing plastic about the performance. This was a show of real character by Everton, fighting back from a goal down to plant one foot firmly in the last 16 of the Europa League. They even played the last half hour a man down after John Stones was sent off. Romelu Lukaku led magnificently from the front with a hat-trick. The big Belgian striker has struggled to justify his £28million price tag from Chelsea last summer, but here he was almost unplayable. It was the perfect hat-trick — header, right foot, left foot — and his first since gatecrashing Sir Alex Ferguson’s farewell game, a potty 5-5 draw between West Bromwich and Manchester United at The Hawthorns two years ago.

He’s a complete striker who can play with his back to the play or get in behind.’ The Everton boss was at pains to point out that this was a team performance, however, and he was right; one arguably even better than the victories home and away against Wolfsburg. Young Boys had won all seven European ties at the Stade de Suisse since reverting to an artificial surface after a 5-3 loss to Liverpool three years ago. But they came up against an Everton team whose form in Europe has been in stark contrast to their struggles in the Premier League. Since qualifying for the knockout stage back in November, they had won only two of their 16 games in all competitions. ‘When you see us play we get back to the memories of last season — a real enjoyment, bravery and energy to what we do,’ added Martinez. ‘There’s no expectation or weight on our shoulders. I do feel that in the league this season we’ve felt a little bit cagey at times and we haven’t been able to express ourselves. The Europa League is completely different. It feels like a fresh competition, a fresh challenge. ‘It was a team performance. To come away and concede the first goal, it becomes a big mountain to climb, a real test of character. The response was incredible.’ Young Boys went ahead in the 10th minute when top-scorer Guillaume Hoarau, once coveted by former Everton boss David Moyes, scooped a shot just inside the post with Tim Howard well beaten. Everton continued to press, however, and stunned the Swiss with two goals in four minutes. Both were the result of crosses from the left. Gareth Barry sent over the first, picking out Lukaku who made no mistake as he guided a header past goalkeeper Yvon Mvogo. Then in the 28th minute, Steven Naismith drifted back from what looked like an offside position and drilled the ball to the far post where Seamus Coleman was waiting to poke in. And Everton took a real grip on the tie when Lukaku claimed his second goal and their third six minutes before half-time. Young Boys took an unexpected lead, when Guillaume Hoarau curled a wonderful effort past Tim Howard and into the bottom corner . John Stones (left) and Phil Jagielka (second right) can only watch on as Hoarau strikes home to give Young Boys a 1-0 lead . Hoarau celebrated by sprinting to the bench and jumping on his Young Boys team-mates, who were covered in blankets to keep warm . Again it was fashioned on the left, and again it came from Barry, whose low cross was deflected into the path of the Belgian who could hardly miss from a couple of yards out. There was still plenty of work left to do, however, and Sekou Sanogo Junior rifled a shot against the foot of the post before Lukaku completed his hat-trick. The striker showed great pace to race away on to Ross Barkley’s through ball, and then real class to dink the ball over Mvogo as he raced out to try to smother. Everton were reduced to 10 men two minutes later when Stones was shown a straight red card for bringing down Hoarau, who spooned the resulting penalty horribly over the bar. It might have made little difference, but Everton’s passage should be even more comfortable when the two teams meet again at Goodison Park next week.

"A couple whose saucy emails went viral on Twitter have both resigned from their jobs in humiliation. Receptionist Melanie Anderson wrote a string of graphic emails to her partner Eric Knisz about their love-life - and then accidentally forwarded them to all her workmates. The emails, which went to 89 members of staff of the oil services firm where they both work, quickly circulated around the world with Twitter users spreading the messages via the hashtag £sandwichvan. The couple have now both resigned from their positions over the embarrassment of the mistake. 'Mortified': Melanie Anderson exchanged saucy emails with her partner Eric Knisz while working on the desk of the oil services firm where they both work . Bruce Webster, HR director for Aberdeen firm Integrated Subsea Services, said: 'While the couple involved made a silly mistake, they did not do anything malicious or unlawful and have therefore not been disciplined. 'Regrettably they have chosen to resign. 'We are however dealing seriously with the issue of the email going out of our organisation and reinforcing our policies in relation to this.' The receptionist sent a brief message to colleagues at Integrated Subsea Services Ltd to let them know the sandwich van was outside. That sinking feeling: Melanie Anderson was trying to be helpful and alert everyone to the sandwich van - but revealed a lot more than she would have liked .

She replied: 'Good because I totally fancy you.' A short time later Eric states: 'I loved our s****** last night...it was ace.' Email perils: The receptionist emailed her colleagues - but accidentally sent them all a trail of private messages . And Melanie replied: 'As I do you handsome, sexy husband.' The emails were then accidentally sent to other colleagues at the harbour office. ISS said the couple were 'mortified' and had apologised for any offence it caused. The couple were not available to speak yesterday and could not be tracked down. Eric is believed to have proposed to his girlfriend last year, and their email discussed how they would wed in 310 days. One . member of staff, Deborah Bowman, sent out an email after receiving it . herself saying: 'Our receptionist is having a productive morning! Ha . Ha...' Melanie Anderson sent saucy emails to her partner Eric Knisz - before accidentally forwarding them on to the rest of her colleagues . And within an hour the email trail had found its way into the inboxes of other oil staff working at completely different firms and the email has become a viral sensation. One Twitter user, known as VJ, seemed unimpressed by the content, mocking the pair for their way of expressing themselves. She wrote: '#sandwichvan is pure gold. ""I love making love to you, it's ace"" - Aberdonians - rivaling the French in the language of love since 2013.' Another Twitter user, called Kayleigh Ross, clearly enjoyed the mistake though.

"Malaysia Airlines has slashed its prices for long-haul routes and is giving away flights as it struggles to hold onto customers and crew following two air tragedies that killed hundreds of people. The beleaguered airline is offering a sale from London Heathrow Airport to Kuala Lumpur and nine other destinations in Malaysia, with return economy class flights selling for as little as £570 on select dates. It is also offering cut-price deals to customers in Australia and New Zealand, and is reportedly giving away 12 return flights to Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, as part of a competition called ‘My Ultimate Bucket List’. Scroll down for video . Struggling: Malaysia Airlines is giving away flights in a competition called 'My Ultimate Bucket List' Malaysia Airlines is cutting its prices amid reports that its passenger numbers have dropped and nearly 200 cabin crew have resigned, causing crew shortages, in the wake of this year’s disasters. Customers appear to be deserting the airline as photos posted on social media show nearly empty cabins. In July, 298 passengers and crew were killed when Flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine – in an area controlled by pro-Russia separatists – while it was en route to Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam. And 239 passengers and crew are missing and presumed dead after Flight MH370, travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, veered far off course and disappeared over the Indian Ocean in March. No wreckage has been found. Tragedy: Flight attendants look on as hearses carry the remains of Flight MH17 victims in Sepang, Malaysia . The Australian and Malaysian governments have agreed to share the £28m price tag for the new phase of the search for Flight MH370, which is thought to have crashed 1,100 miles off Australia's west coast. Meanwhile, the state-owned airline is set for a shakeup, with analysts predicting that it will slash jobs, drop money-losing routes to Europe and China and replace top management in an announcement that is expected tomorrow. It was already struggling when the twin disasters occurred, losing nearly £1bn since 2011. Malaysia Airlines regional senior vice president Lee Poh Kait told news.com.au that the sale aimed to help rebuild trust. He said: ‘We would like to thank our passengers for their support during what has been a difficult period. ‘We are committed to regaining the confidence of our customers and sending them on memorable holiday experiences as a trusted five-star carrier. ‘With unbelievable savings these deals are a very competitive offering as we build a stronger Malaysia Airlines.’","State-owned airline giving away flights in 'My Ultimate Bucket List' promotion .

"Roberto Martinez said Romelu Lukaku had demonstrated he 'loves playing for Everton' with his performance in the 4-1 victory at Young Boys in the Europa League. Lukaku delivered a stand-out individual display as part of what was an impressive team effort by the Toffees in the Europa League last 32 first leg in Switzerland, notching three of their goals to register his first Toffees hat-trick. The 21-year-old Belgium striker, who Everton paid a club record £28 million for last summer to recruit him from Chelsea after having him on loan for the previous season, was quoted last week following a 1-0 loss to his former employers as saying he would like to 'eventually arrive at a top club again.' Everton forward Romelu Lukaku put in a dazzling performance against Young Boys in the Europa League . Everton boss Roberto Martinez says that Lukaku's performance demonstrates his commitment to the club . Lukaku was quoted saying he wanted to play for a 'top club' again, implying Everton were not one . But Martinez played down that matter after the Young Boys match, saying: 'There has been a lot written about that - there was a conversation taken a little bit out of context after the Chelsea game. 'It was clearly someone looking for a headline about if Rom wanted to perform in order to come back to Chelsea, and his answer probably didn't reflect what he meant. 'It's never an issue. Rom was delighted to commit himself to Everton. 'He loves playing for Everton, and I think he showed that today. 'A footballer needs to be measured by the way he talks on the pitch. Sometimes a microphone can be put in front of you and people then dissect everything you say and highlight a word or line which is not appropriate. 'It's not an issue. He's a special footballer who we love seeing developing, and he's just enjoying being an important player for Everton.' Martinez added of Lukaku, who now has 13 goals this season: 'He's the complete striker, but he's only 21 and people forget about that. 'Our desire and work we put in over the summer was to show we are the perfect place for him to develop. 'We saw today he really makes a difference in front of goal and he's someone who is going to have a really strong ending to the season.' The Toffees paid a club-record £28 million transfer fee to sign Lukaku from Chelsea last summer . The Belgian has scored 13 goals in 34 appearances in all competitions for Everton so far this season . Although Everton, 12th in the Barclays Premier League, have struggled for momentum domestically this season, they have flourished in what is their first continental campaign since 2009-10. That continued to be the case at the Stade de Suisse, despite the fact they were playing on an artificial pitch - they had prepared by training on a similar surface at home - and fell behind early on to Guillaume Hoarau's curler. The Toffees stormed back, with two Lukaku efforts either side of a Seamus Coleman finish, as well as some Tim Howard heroics and a goal-line block from James McCarthy, seeing them go in at half time 3-1 up. Lukaku subsequently completed his treble just before the hour, and Everton soon after had John Stones sent off for pulling back Hoarau, who missed the resulting penalty. Martinez said: 'I was extremely delighted with the reaction, because coming away from home and conceding the first goal, it becomes a big mountain to climb and a real test of character. 'I thought it was incredible the way we took responsibility and got on the ball - some of our attacking play was electric. 'The amount of chances we created was testament to the performance, and remember Young Boys have a fantastic home record (five Europa League victories out of five this season prior to the Everton game). That makes it an even more special result. 'It was a team performance that deserves incredible credit, also because we went down to 10 men. 'John Stones will learn massively from today's moment. We had to dig deep and defend with 10 men but we still looked like the team with most threat. That says a lot about the tactical awareness the players have developed. 'When you see us play (in Europe this season) it seems we get back to the memories of last season (when Everton finished fifth in the Premier League) - a real enjoyment, bravery and energy in everything we do.' Everton defender John Stones was shown a red card during his side's 4-1 win over Young Boys . The victory at Young Boys sees Roberto Martinez' men take a commanding lead into the tie's second leg . Both Bryan Oviedo and McCarthy came off injured, but Martinez dismissed the idea that had been down to the pitch. Young Boys boss Uli Forte claimed Everton's second and third goals should have been disallowed for offside. He said: 'That was a tough night for us. 'We had a good start, were very dynamic and scored the first goal, but then we lost control of the game. 'We were too passive and then we had the two goals against us which were offside, which made it even harder for us. 'We tried to come back after the break, but the fourth goal was it for us. It was a very unlucky evening, but we have to accept that - that's football. Toffees midfielder James McCarthy came off injured in the 70th minute against Young Boys .

"He is a magnet for drama, isn’t he? Life with Mario Balotelli is never dull and so it proved again. There is a reason it is always him. A coolly dispatched 84th-minute penalty gives Liverpool a slender advantage to protect in Istanbul but that only tells a fragment of the story of how this most mercurial of strikers delivered for Brendan Rodgers when it mattered most. When Jordon Ibe was bundled over by Ramon Motta, Jordan Henderson seemed certain to take the captain’s role and assume responsibility for the spot-kick. Daniel Sturridge also wanted to take it. But then up popped Balotelli, who took the ball off Henderson and put it on the spot. Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli struck a late penalty as the Reds beat Besiktas 1-0 in the Europa League .

Subs not used: Fidayeo, Pektemek, Arslan, Uysal, Opare . Booked: Gulum, Kurtulus, Motta, Franco . Referee: Szymon Marciniak (Poland) From the scenes that followed, that decision was anything but popular. But as some squabbled and manager Rodgers looked on stone-faced, Balotelli barely flickered. He simply tapped Henderson on the arm, told him he was fine and then casual sent Cenk Goken the wrong way. This was his third big contribution in a week, following on from a goal against Tottenham and a free-kick that led to Adam Lallana’s winner at Crystal Palace, and how it was needed. This tie, as Besiktas manager Slaven Bilic noted, is far from over and another test of character awaits in Istanbul. Finally, however, Liverpool are winning again in Europe. Rodgers message before this contest was a hope and desire that they would play with verve and dash and show Europe a glimpse of the dynamic brand that almost carried them to the title. The Champions League campaign, after all, had been a washout. Liverpool’s performances in those six games with Real Madrid, Ludogorets and Basle were miserable and never threatened to take them to the latter stages. Having won their opening contest in September with a late penalty, Liverpool then lurched from bad to worse and did not win any of their remaining five fixtures. A failure to beat Besiktas, then, would have seen them set an unwanted club record of most games without a victory in Europe. In the first attack, you could see the difference between the Liverpool of then and now as a slick move, which involved Joe Allen and Ibe, ended with Sturridge hoodwinking Ersan Gulum with a deft back heel but goalkeeper Cenk Gonen parried his shot. Stood in his technical area, Rodgers acknowledged the passage of passing with a thumbs up but the period of domination he might have expected to follow did not arrive, as Besiktas showed themselves to be obdurate opponents.They frustrated Tottenham at White Hart Lane in this competition last October and it was easy to see why they have been so proficient, as they worked relentlessly and had menace on the break.

They almost took the lead in the 32nd minute when, from Jose Sosa’s corner, Veli Kavlak wriggled free of Emre Can but his header lacked the direction to bother Simon Mignolet and it whistled over the bar. In the next attack, memories of how the Premier League crown slipped away in April were evoked as Demba Ba was sent scuttling through towards The Kop. We had been here before, former Chelsea striker Ba with the ball at his feet, defenders trying to catch up with him but this time Mignolet was equal to the task. That jolted a response from Liverpool and, as some hefty tackles were traded, they finished an intriguing first 45 minutes on the front foot, with first the impressive Alberto Moreno, from fully 35 yards, and then Henderson testing Gonen. When Besiktas were last at Anfield in November 2007, they saw a 2-0 interval deficit become an 8-0 full-time mauling and the way Liverpool started the second period suggested they were in the mood to do something similar. They really should have broken the deadlock in the 48th minute. Besiktas striker Ba has a shot in goal during the first half which is saved by the Liverpool goalkeeper .

Henderson, once again a figure of perpetual motion in the heart of Liverpool’s midfield, scampered down the right flank and managed to fire in a cross that caused all sorts of confusion between Gonen, Besiktas second choice keeper, and defender Pedro Franco. Comically colliding together, they succeeded to present Adam Lallana with a glorious chance but the England international lost his composure and carelessly hoisted the opening above the bar. Not long after, Rodgers took decisive action. Off came Joe Allen and Philippe Coutinho and they were replaced by Dejan Lovren and Balotelli, allowing Can to move into midfield alongside Henderson and keep Liverpool pressing up the pitch. Eventually the move reaped dividends. Whether Balotelli was given hearty support in the dressing room is open to debate but that should not matter. He made a difference. Winning is all that counts.

"Ex-footballer Stan Collymore says he has been dropped as a pundit by BT Sport. The former Liverpool and England striker tweeted: 'Just had a call from @btsportfootball. I'm taken off tomorrow's show. Absolutely fine. Better to be right than bury my head. Enjoy! 'I can hold my head high and say i did the right thing to challenge hypocrisy amongst Rangers fans. BT show £RFC games, so inevitable.' Former Liverpool striker Stan Collymore has been dropped as a pundit by BT Sport . The outspoken broadcaster had called for Rangers to be pulled off the television if their fans continue to sing sectarian songs. After announcing the news on the internet, Collymore became locked in a fiery online exchange with some sports fans, many of whom brought up his own history of domestic violence. It had been triggered after Collymore backed a petition which said: 'Boycott sponsors Sectarian chanting is illegal. Demeaning.' He urged his online followers to show their support and said if they signed the petition, he would 'take it to every sponsor and tv/radio station i know.' Collymore had called for Rangers games to stop being broadcast as long as fans used sectarian chants . Collymore hit back at his critics and wrote: 'All @btsportfootball have done tonight is empower right wing mob rule. Nothing else. 8 friends and i have cancelled already. Hypocrisy.' He also wrote: 'You can get sectarian, racist, threats from Rangers fans but can't tell truths. Censorship & fascism alive and well in 2015 Britain.' A BT Sport spokesman said: 'BT Sport does not agree with any form of racism and believes that it should not be tolerated in Sport. It is a subject which should be tackled and discussed in the correct manner. 'We did not agree with the nature of the debate on twitter, and which BT Sport was brought into without prior agreement. BT Sport will raise and discuss the issue within its programming when relevant and in an appropriate manner.'

"A pensioner was stunned when he stepped outside his front door and almost walked into a six-foot wide spider web spread across his drive. Russell Harding, 74, was horrified to find the giant web, which stretched from his car’s wing mirror to his shed, had a huge inch-and-a-half spider sat in the middle. Mr Harding, of Colerne, Wiltshire, said he was 'mystified' by the creation and how the spider managed to span such a distance. 'I don't understand how the spider did it, it was incredible,' he said. 'I'm just mystified. Scroll down for video . 'Mystified': The pensioner couldn't believe his eyes when he stepped outside and saw the six-foot web, which appears even bigger in the angle of this photograph . Huge: This spider, measuring an inch-and-half, sat in the middle of a giant web in front of  Rusell Harding's garage door . 'It was right across the path way, I had to move it to walk through, I managed to detach it from my wing mirror and move it 90 degrees to a bin so it was still in tact but we could leave our house. 'The spider itself was about an inch-and-a-half wide, we think it was a she because of the size, she was very big. 'I have never seen a web that big before. 'My wife would have actually passed out if she had walked into the web. There would have been a lot of screaming. Mr Harding took the web, which stretched from his car’s wing mirror to his shed, and moved it 90 degrees . 'Fortunately it had been a very dewy morning which highlighted the web so I saw it before I walked into it.' The web, which appeared overnight last Thursday, disappeared after three days. Lawrence Bee, of the British Arachnological Society, said: 'It’s almost certainly a garden spider (Araneus diadematus) which are extremely common throughout the UK at this time of year, spinning its large orb web in amongst shrubs and bushes in gardens and the wider countryside.' False widows: Britain's most venomous spider . While garden spiders are completely harmless, there has been a spate of serious spider attacks in recent weeks, predominantly from false widows - Britain's most venomous spider. Much of their reputation is thought to be thanks to the black widow, which although similarly named is far more dangerous and has been known to kill children, ill or elderly people. Although its bites can be intensely uncomfortable - swelling hugely when infected - the false widow (above) is not known to have caused any deaths in Britain. By comparison, around four Britons each year are though to die from bee or wasp stings when they have an allergic reaction. False widow spiders are distinctive with their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns. Millions of false widows, Britain's most venomous spider, are found across the UK and the population is growing. Also known by its Latin name Steatoda Nobilis, its first British sighting was in Torquay, Devon, in 1879 and is thought to have remained largely in southern England. But the Natural History Museum says warmer summers mean the spider is spreading north, a theory backed by wildlife sightings. Eugene Murphy, from Dublin, was bitten three times on the shoulder and soon stopped breathing and went into cardiac arrest. And Shireen Larson, 33, from Enfield, Middlesex, was bitten in pub garden and rushed to hospital after her leg turned black, yellow and blistered.","Russell Harding, 74, found the web when he went to work in his garage .

"A woman who was bullied at school and only had ferrets for friends has had the last laugh after launching a successful modelling career. Sophie Roper, 20, took her pet animals on long walks in the hills whenever she was feeling lonely during her teenage years. She said she had been bullied relentlessly during her formative years but that her four beloved pet ferrets had always kept her good company. Scroll down for video . Sophie Roper, from Roseneath, Scotland, was bullied at school and only had ferrets for friends. But now, the budding catwalk queen has launched a successful modelling career . It all started when her family moved to Scotland from Southend, Essex, at the age of 13 and she struggled to fit in with the girls at her new school. Ferrets Sasha, Sunny, Mr Blister, and Baby, helped Sophie through the hard years when she found it difficult to make firm friends and boosted her confidence. And now, the wannabe Victoria's Secret Angel hopes to take first prize at the Top Model UK competition in March and bag a place on the catwalk at London Fashion Week. Speaking about her difficult school years, Sophie, from Rosneath, Argyll and Bute, said: 'I had a lot of trouble trying to fit in with different friendship groups. 'A lot of the time I would be deceived into thinking they were my friend but I was just being used as a prop in their schemes.' Sophie, pictured at the age of 14, took her pet ferrets on long walks in the hills near her home when she was growing up to avoid looking alone . The bullying started when Sophie's family moved to Scotland from Southend, England, at the age of 13 and she struggled to fit in with the girls at her new school . She continued: 'I would get a lot of grief for trying to get along with people and would get slagged off a lot for what I was wearing because I didn't care at the time. I'd get used and spoken down to. 'I still have trust issues today because of the way I was treated. I would always try to help people not expecting anything in return but hoping for it.' Explaining how she became so close to her furry pets, Sophie said: 'The ferrets were my excuse to leave the house and not seem as alone as I was. I took them for quite long walks in the hills near my home. 'It might sound sad but they were my friends. For a long time, along with my sister, they were the only friends that I had. 'The ferrets wouldn't judge me and were always there for me when I had a bad day. They were a big responsibility. 'At school, I couldn't bring the ferrets with me so I always felt lonelier than usual. I would wander the corridors on my own or chat to teachers just to look as though I was busy. 'I was very shy and quiet at school. I would keep to myself but sometimes just break out in tears. I would always be embarrassed to be seen alone.' The 20 year-old   had been bullied relentlessly during her formative years but her pets kept her company. Now, the wannabe Victoria's Secret Angel hopes to take first prize at the Top Model UK competition in March . When she was 15, Sophie entered her first pageant and finished in fourth place at Miss Caledonia Scotland . The ferrets sadly died two years ago, but at that point Sophie had managed to make some human friends who encouraged her as she entered her first pageants. Her first foray into pageantry came when she was 15 when she finished in fourth place at Miss Caledonia Scotland. Speaking about her success, Sophie said: 'That was my first pageant and I managed to finish fourth out of everyone in Scotland. I've stuck at it since then. For now, the sky is the limit. 'My family have always been really close and encouraging. That helped me to get over my problems. 'Gradually I managed to find some friends who weren't ferrets and they have encouraged me to get out of my shell a bit.' Explaining how she became so close to her furry pets, Sophie said: 'The ferrets were my excuse to leave the house and not seem as alone as I was. I took them for quite long walks in the hills near my home' Sophie says her family have always been 'really close and encouraging', which helped her through the tough school years she endured . And now, the fledgling model has grand plans for the future and hopes her appearance at the Top Model UK competition will lead to great things. 'I am obsessed with the Victoria's Secret Angels,' she said. 'It's my dream to become one of them - though I might be about 84 by the time I manage it. 'I've even managed to swear off of chocolate, crisps and everything bad to give me the best chance of winning.' Ferrets Sasha, Sunny, Mr Blister, and Baby, who died two years ago, helped Sophie overcome her shyness .

"There were reasons beyond the 211 runs he scored in South Africa last month that convinced Jonathan Trott he was back. There was his success in batting all day in the blistering heat during that unbeaten innings in Paarl. And the fact he was unfazed by the short ball that was seen as his Achilles heel after his sudden exit from the last Ashes tour. But, more important to Trott and the reason why he now hopes to return to the England side as an opening batsman alongside Alastair Cook, was how he felt in himself. Jonathan Trott (centre) performed admirably for the England Lions in South Africa last month . Captain Trott relaxes during England Lions training at Chevrolet Park in Bloemfontein back in January . He was so calm and composed; a result, in his words, of being a ‘more rounded person’ than ever before. ‘On and off the pitch,’ he says. This feeling of contentment, this renewed confidence, is something that has come from working through the anxiety issues he endured before he started working with Dr Steve Peters last year. And on Friday, after a brilliant tour of South Africa as captain of the England Lions, Trott thinks he can return to his very best. That would be something when it was only in 2011 that he was named ICC Cricketer of the Year. But the 33-year-old is oozing positivity and enjoying cricket in a way that was not always possible in the past. ‘I already felt I was well on the way back when I was playing for Warwickshire in the summer,’ he says. ‘But when I batted a whole day in Paarl, where it was probably 42 degrees in the middle, it felt like a good achievement. ‘It was a good checkpoint for myself, and the selectors and coaches. And I was pleased because that’s what you train for. To be able to do that was very satisfying.’ Australia's Mitchell Johnson celebrates taking wicket of Trott  during the 2013 Ashes series . Trott returned home soon after that first Ashes Test in Brisbane due to his anxiety issues . It was satisfying because it was proof that he was right to back himself when so many feared he would never return to first-class cricket — when even he feared his career might be over when he took a second break away from the game last year. ‘I’m pleased that the hard work has paid off, because I had to work hard to get back,’ Trott adds. ‘South Africa has shown that my belief is not unfounded; that I can still do well, wherever it is in the order for the full England side.’ Before he left that Ashes tour he was secure batting at No 3. Now, however, the slot alongside Cook is where he might be required when England head to the West Indies next month. ‘I played at No 5 in my first Test and was happy there, but was then moved to No 3,’ he says. ‘I’ve always been happy to do what I am asked to do, and I’d be more than happy to open. ‘I’d love to play in the Tests and one-dayers in the West Indies. ‘It’s the next step for me. My thought process when I was playing second-team cricket at Warwickshire was the need to earn a place in the first team. Now I’m back on the Lions team and my focus has been to try to earn a place in the England team. I’m not saying I’ve done that, but I’ve put a pretty good case forward. Trott hopes to return to the England side as an opening batsman alongside Alastair Cook (above) ‘I feel good. I’m clear in my head, if I get the chance to play for England again, how I’d play and how I’d approach it. I think I’d be right back to my best, because I feel a more rounded person than when I played for England before. ‘On and off the field I’m a better person, in the way I handle stuff.’ Trott handled all aspects of the Lions tour well. From captaincy to the challenges he faced. ‘I really enjoyed it,’ he says. ‘Captaining was a new challenge, which was nice. It was important I threw myself into the tour. ‘The Lions is a window of opportunity for players to get into the full England side and be ready for Test cricket. It was important I treated it like a full Test tour because it was exactly what I needed. They offered me the captaincy but they also asked me if I’d prefer to concentrate on my batting on my first tour back. ‘But it had already dawned on me that I might be asked when I looked at the squad and the ages of the players, so I’d thought about it already. And I told them I really wanted to do it, even if I did have more in common with the coaches than some of the lads I was playing with. I was the oldest guy there by quite a few years! ‘But it was good. And it was nice seeing these young guys; all so excited about their careers, some of them making the kind of mistakes I used to make. Trott has worked closely with Dr Steve Peters (above), who has helped him employ a new approach to batting . ‘But these guys are 23 and a lot further down the line than I was at their age. The future’s looking bright for England.’ His work with Peters has enabled Trott to employ a new approach to his batting. ‘They tried the short ball in South Africa,’ he says. ‘I was expecting it and I actually don’t mind it. As a batsman it gives you the opportunity to get your eye in because they’re not really trying to get you out. ‘It also makes the ball a lot softer when they are banging it into the wicket, so it can work for me in a couple of ways. ‘But it was an opportunity to work on my all-round game. And recognise the fact that this is where I’d get stuck in the past, trying to attack people’s perceptions of me, trying to please everybody, rather than simply playing to my strengths. ‘I’d try and play all over the wicket when most players don’t. ‘Most players focus on the areas where they are strongest. That is what makes them successful. ‘It’s about sticking to your gameplan. A footballer who can’t dribble doesn’t try to run with the ball through the opposition. He sticks to his strengths. It was not doing that where I came up short in the past, and where I’m now better.’ So what about The Ashes this summer? ‘I’ve not been selected for the next tour yet,’ he says. ‘But I can only take it one series at a time. If I get selected for the West Indies, then great. If I don’t, then I’ll keep working. But I’m a good team man.’ Trott is back in Australia now, working in the media at the Cricket World Cup. ‘I just want to see if I like it and if I’m any good at it,’ he says. He thinks it might be something for the future. But not until he’s done playing the game he has grown to love again.","Jonathan Trott captained the England Lions on tour in South Africa .

"Military fighter jets were called in to escort a passenger plane to Toronto airport after two women caused so much disruption that the Sunwing flight bound for Cuba was forced to turn back. A spokesman for the airline claimed the passengers had consumed a 'significant quantity' of their duty-free alcohol - and also lit a cigarette in the toilet, triggering the smoke alarm. It is also alleged the women, who were arrested when the plane landed, got into a fight with each other and 'made a threat against the aircraft'. Under threat: The pilot of the flight from Toronto to Cuba said the women were disruptive in a 'serious manner' The pilot of the 737 aircraft, who described the passengers as being disorderly 'in a serious manner,' reported to NORAD (North American Aerospace Defence Command) while the plane was in US airspace that the aircraft was 'under threat'. Police officers were called to the airport around 8pm and the two passengers were arrested when the plane landed, said George Tudos with Peel Regional Police. 'At 7.15pm we received a call that there was a Sunwing flight that was being diverted back to Pearson due to two female parties on board that were quite disruptive,' Tudos told CBC News. 'It was escorted by military planes back to Pearson, where it was met by our airport officers. 'We are continuing the investigation to find out what happened and are speaking to witnesses who were on the flight. We take all situations seriously and we are going to make sure that plane is safe before it leaves the gate.' Two CF-18 fighter jets  escorted the plane on its way back to Canada. The Sunwing flight was escorted by military planes back to Toronto's Pearson International Airport . The women, who face charges of smoking on board and endangering safety on an aircraft, have been identified as 25-year-old Lilia Ratmanski from Whitby and 26-year-old Milana Muzikante from Vaughan. A spokesman for Sunwing said that the plane was diverted after a smoke alarm was triggered. 'It is reported that the passengers consumed a significant quantity of their duty-free alcohol purchase in the lavatory and lit a cigarette, triggering the smoke detector alarm,' she said. 'These passengers proceeded to get into a physical altercation with each other and made a threat against the aircraft, which was considered non-credible given their condition. 'Our flight crew followed the appropriate procedures and the aircraft was diverted back to Toronto where it has now landed.' 'We are very apologetic for the inconvenience experienced by our customers and thankful to our flight crew for their efforts to safely manage the situation.' The flight was expected to take off again at around 11pm and customers will be provided with complimentary meal vouchers, a statement said.","Plane to Cuba forced to return to Toronto's Pearson International airport .

"A Leeds United executive who emailed pornographic images of women naked in the shower to a female receptionist at the club was rightly sacked, a judge has ruled. Gwyn Williams, 66, was summarily dismissed for gross misconduct in July 2013, but had asked the High Court to award him up to £250,000 in compensation for breach of contract. Mr Williams, who joined Leeds in August 2006 as technical director on a £200,000-a-year salary, plus benefits, claimed the email he sent to former Leeds manager Dennis Wise, Gus Poyet - now head coach of Sunderland - and receptionist Carol Lamb was part of a 'dirty Leeds' joke, referring to the club's reputation for heavy tackling in the 1970s. Former Leeds United executive Gwyn Williams (pictured) was rightly sacked after he emailed pornographic images of women naked in the shower to a female receptionist, a judge has ruled . The former scout, who  had discovered John Terry while he was working at Chelsea, had agreed that his conduct was inappropriate but argued it was not sufficiently serious to amount to a repudiatory breach of contract. The email was sent in March 2008, the same year that Mr Williams spent one game as caretaker manager after Wise left the club in January of that year. Mr Poyet, who had been Mr Wise's assistant had left the previous October to take up a coaching role with Tottenham Hotspur. But the message was not discovered for another five years and eight months, when the club was allegedly conducting a forensic examination to find a reason to justify not paying him his notice, Mr Williams told Mr Justice Lewis. The message was discovered when Leeds were allegedly conducting a forensic examination to find a reason to justify not paying him his notice, Mr Williams told Mr Justice Lewis . On Thursday, the judge said that, taken as a whole, the images in the email were 'obscene and pornographic', and not common in professional football at the time. 'The photographs do more than than depict a group of muddy women showering,' Mr Justice Lewis said. 'They involve displays of female genitalia and breasts and scenes of simulated sexual activity between women. 'It is also difficult to understand why, if forwarding the email and attachments was intended to do no more than share a verbal joke about Leeds, he should choose to send the email to only one employee, a junior female employee.' The judge added that the photos had gone far beyond a play on words and it was more likely that Mr Williams had sent them to Mr Wise and Mr Poyet as he considered, rightly or wrongly, that they would appreciate being sent such material. In his judgement, Mr Justice Lewis said the forwarding of the email to the trio amounted to a sufficiently serious breach of the implied duty of mutual trust and confidence as to entitle the club to dismiss Mr Williams without notice. Mr Williams had also sent the email to former Leeds manager Dennis Wise (left), and his ex-assistant Gus Poyet, who is now head coach at  Sunderland . It was simply incompatible with his role and duties as a senior manager at the club, the judge added. He also ruled that the sending of the images to a junior female employee might well have caused offence, and left the club vulnerable to a claim for sexual harassment. And forwarding the images via an email address containing the phrase 'leedsunited' might have led to negative press coverage and affected the club's ability to find or retain sponsors and supporters, according to the ruling. It was also not compatible with Mr Williams's role of providing advice and guidance, and acting as an example, to those young people whose football career he was nurturing. Mr Williams was refused permission to appeal although he can renew his application directly to the Court of Appeal. He was ordered to make a payment to the club of £45,000 on account of legal costs. His lawyers said that he would be pursuing a claim for unfair dismissal at an employment tribunal.","Former technical director dismissed for gross misconduct in July 2013 .

"New uncovered photos reveal a smiling former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez as he  parties with friends just days after he's accused to gunning down two men in Boston. The 24-year-old now faces charges he pulled the trigger in the chilling July 2012 double homicide, but photos snapped days later in posh Newport, Rhode Island do not show a man riddled with guilt for his alleged crimes. Instead, the fallen football star is seen beaming as he gladly posed for pictures with employees at a shop where he rented scooters and jet skis during a weeklong seaside holiday. Seaside escape: Aaron Hernandez took these carefree pictures with employees of a Newport, Rhode Island jet ski rental shop just days after he allegedly gunned down two men in Boston from the window of his SUV . Chilling: Hernandez partied with friends in Newport while showing no obvious signs of regret. However, according to witnesses, he and his group were 'acting weird, laughing and goofing around then punching each other in the face' More charges: Aaron Hernandez has been charged with two additional counts of first-degree murder in connection with a 2012 double murder in Boston . While he appears to be having a good time, witnesses say his behavior while on holiday wasn't completely normal. A source told MyFoxBoston that the former tight end and his group were 'acting weird, laughing and goofing around then punching each other in the face.' Hernandez has been linked to a total . of three killings and is already being held without bail after pleading . not guilty to murder in the death of 27-year-old Odin Lloyd last year. In the 2012 case, victims Daniel Abreu, 29, and Safiro Furtado, 28, were shot as they sat in a car in the city's South End. A grand jury moved forward Friday morning with the indictment for the July 16, 2012 killing of the the lifelong friends shot to death as they sat waiting at a red light. Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley said during a Friday morning press conference that he expects the former Patriot to be arraigned on the additional murder charges early next week. Investigators believe that Hernandez was driving the SUV used in the shooting and likely fired the shots that killed Abreu and Furtado. Hernandez is seen in surveillance footage with friend Alexander Bradley entering the nightclub Cure at about 12.30 a.m. on July 16, 2012 and quickly guzzling two drinks, according to an affidavit cited by WCVB. Abreu and Furtado entered just before him. He and Bradley leave after about 10 minutes and exit a nearby parking garage in a Toyota 4Runner, the affidavit says. Abreu and Furtado leave the club at about 2.10 a.m. Hernandez's SUV is seen driving slowly past the two men twice as they walked to the parking garage, the document says. He is believed to have followed them down Shawmut Avenue to the light where they were eventually shot to death. 'Aaron Hernandez fired a .38-caliber revolver multiple times from the driver’s side of his vehicle in to the passenger side of the other vehicle,' Conley explained, adding the victims were 'stalked and ambushed in the city they call home.' Both men were shot multiple times - Abreu died from a bullet to the chest, Furtado was killed by a shot to the head. The six shots fired from the SUV with Rhode Island plates, according to witnesses, were not caught on camera. A third person was wounded in the attack but survived, according to reports.That person is said to be key to the prosecution's case and may even testify in court. 'Things happened so fast,' the passenger told Fox 25. 'I was trying to defend myself. They were shooting everywhere inside the car, front to back. They just came to kill. That's it.' The witness said he recognized Hernandez's face after he was arrested last year for Lloyd's death. Gunned down: Daniel Abreu (left) and Safir Furtado (right) were shot dead by Aaron Hernandez, authorities said . Investigators initially believed the drive-by shooting was gang-related, sources told the Boston Globe. Initial reports suggested Abreu and Furtado were gang members, but Conley made it clear that they were not. Aldo quashed were rumors they knew Hernandez prior to the night they were killed. 'These men were ambushed and executed as they drove home,' said Conley. 'Neither of [the victims] were involved in gangs, guns or violence of any kind. 'Their chance encounter inside a club triggered a series of events that culminated in these murders.' Neither had a criminal record, they both worked for a cleaning company, family told Fox 25. The case . remained unsolved until recently, but they believe evidence links . Hernandez to those murders after they observed him on nearby surveillance footage and a nightclub bouncer contacted police saying he had knowledge that the two incidents... were related,' according to the Boston Herald. Last year, Abreu's sister lamented the lack of leads in the investigation to WBZ. Victim: Odin Llloyd was shot dead in June last year . 'It’s really frustrating, I think about it a lot and I cry. The only thing I can do is pray to God,' said Neusa Abreu. 'I don’t know if [Hernandez] was abused as a child or had a rough life. I’m not sure what the issue is and why this had to happen,' she added. Investigators' focus shifted towards the former All-Pro after he was linked to the murder of Odin Lloyd. It is believed Hernandez may have killed Lloyd because he was concerned the semi-pro football player was talking about the double murders, law enforcement sources have said. Investigators told the Globe that they believe Hernandez enlisted the help of two childhood friends from Bristol, Connecticut, to help kill Lloyd in an effort to keep word of the star player's involvement in the other two murders from spreading. Friday morning's indictment brings full circle investigators' suspicions Hernandez was involved in the two deaths, whispers first made public earlier this year when court documents in the Lloyd case were unsealed. 'There is ... probable cause to believe that Aaron Hernandez was operating the suspect vehicle used in the shooting homicides ... and may have been the shooter,' a 2013 warrant made public by WCVB reads. Investigators have since located the handgun used to kill both men and the silver Toyota Hernandez was driving the night they were killed. The SUV was discovered in the garage of a Bristol home owned by one of Hernandez's uncles. The double murder occurred only one week before the start of the Patriots training camp for the 2012-2013 season. Hernandez played in 10 games that season, scoring five touchdowns while catching 51 passes for 483 yards, raising the possibility that he played after shooting two people dead. His contract with the team was terminated after he was arrested at his home in suburban North Attleboro in June 2013 on live television. Ernest Hernandez, believed to be one of Hernandez's accomplices in the murder of Lloyd, is expected to be arraigned for the murder Friday afternoon. Carlos Ortiz will be arraigned May 27 on murder charges for Lloyd's death, the Globe reported. Lloyd's body was discovered by a runner in an industrial park not far from Hernandez's home. It is believed by prosecutors that Hernandez and his accomplices drove Lloyd to the park and killed him. Hernandez's legal team has not made any comments on the additional charges. He is being held in Bristol County Jail without bail.","Former football star is pictured partying in Rhode Island in newly revealed photos from days after he's accused of slaying two in Massachusetts .

A 30-year-old swimmer claims she was barred from two Philadelphia, Pennsylvania public pools because security guards thought her tiny American Apparel bikini looked like underwear. Lisa Conn said male employees 'harassed' and 'ridiculed' her when she showed up wearing a watermelon-print, ruched front tube top with skimpy yellow bottoms. 'I am flat-chested. My two-piece reveals . nothing. I don't know if this is a bullying thing, a race thing, or . humiliating women for the sake of it,' Conn opined. 'But I pay my taxes and I love my . pool. I don't want any woman to be made to feel the way that I feel.' Denied: Philadelphia barista Lisa Conn, 30, said two public pools denied her access because they claimed her American Apparel swimwear looked like underwear . What she was wearing: Lisa Conn said she was 'harassed' by male staff at two Philadelphia public pools for wearing this swimsuit from American Apparel . Conn, a barista, told Philly Mag she was rejected from a Hunting Park pool on Sunday because of her swimsuit. 'The large male security guard refused to let me swim,' she claimed. 'He said I could not get in wearing a 'bra and panties.' Those were his words. I insisted it was an American Apparel swimsuit.' Conn claimed the guard then told a male lifeguard to check the tag on the inside of her bottoms. Although she was eventually allowed to swim, she claimed a guard 'ridiculed' her in front of other swimmers. 'He told everyone that I was swimming in a bra and panties. I finally left, asking for his name, which he refused to give me. I came in smiling and happy and left on the verge of tears,' she said. She said she called to complain but the pool's voice mail was full. But her troubles didn't end there. Conn claims she was harassed at a different pool the next day. 'There . was a male supervisor present, and the scenario was almost identical,' she said. 'I was not allowed to swim at all. He also used the term 'bra and . panties'.' She said she called to complain about the supervisor on Tuesday, but workers said no-one with the name he gave her worked there. Customer service: After hearing about Lisa Conn's alleged ordeal, American Apparel contacted her through Twitter and offered her a range of free merchandise . Conn told Philly Mag some of her female friends have experienced similar issues. Philadelphia Parks & Recreation aquatics coordinator, Lisa Whittle, described Conn's experience as 'unfortunate'. She said swimmers are banned from wearing underwear at public pools, which would violate the Pennsylvania health code, before adding, 'We certainly don't want anyone to feel uncomfortable in our pools.' Meanwhile, American Apparel reached out to Conn on Twitter yesterday, offering her a range of free merchandise for her troubles. 'Hey Lisa, glad we got in touch. Keep an eye out—you'll be swimming in AA gifts soon!' the company tweeted.","Lisa Conn claims security guards told swimmers she was wearing 'bra and panties' and refused her access this week .

"A top U.S. general responsible for shaping the military of the future has revealed that robots could make up a quarter of the army within the next few decades. General Robert Cone said the hi-tech machines will fight alongside soldiers on the battlefield by 2030 or 2040, in a bid to make the army 'a smaller, more lethal, deployable and agile force'. Speaking at an Army Aviation symposium, in Arlington, Virginia, the head of U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) gave his vision of sci-fi made reality. Attack force: The army of the future could be made of autonomous robots fighting alongside soldiers, a top U.S. general revealed . He said modern health and safety concerns designed to keeping soldiers safe - adding armour and protection to vehicles and personnel - had caused the army to lose some of its lethal edge. He hinted that robots could revitalise the U.S. army's killing force. But he cautioned that the machinery required would demand a major revolution in robotic technology. General Cone said: 'I’ve got clear guidance to think about what if you could robotically perform some of the tasks in terms of maneuverability, in terms of the future of the force, 'according to Defense News. Put through its paces: A strikingly human-like robot undergoes testing in a laboratory which could help produce mechanical soldiers by 2030 . The Army is under pressure to cut the . number of soldiers, from 540,000 soldiers to about 490,000 by the end . of 2015, and down to 420,000 by 2019, according to some reports. One . of the major factors driving the pursuit of robotic battlefield . technology is the need to drive down the cost of the conventional army. In . 2012, 25 per cent of the near $130 billion plus Pentagon budget went on . serving and retired members of the military, according to Popular Science. Future today: Robots, such as this one known as PETMAN, are currently in use by the U.S. army . The increased reliance on robots would help slash the huge expense used to train, equip, accommodate, nurse and retire regular troops. The U.S. Army has had a long-running mission to create autonomous robots - machines capable of making decisions, in real time, on the frontline to changing circumstances. More than a decade of war in Afghanistan and Iraq allowed the public to see the huge resources already dedicated to unmanned systems; from the high-flying Global Hawk to the lethal Predator drones to hand-launched Raven. Revolution: Autonomous vehicles and remote controlled aircraft are no longer a thing from science fiction but a battlefield reality - now the next generation of military robots is being designed . But on the ground, thousands of small, remotely operated robots also have proven their value in dealing with roadside bombs, a lethal threat to U.S. troops in both wars. The army has already been trailing remote controlled vehicles, such as the Black Night Transformer, a specially made truck that comes complete with eight rotors - four on each side - that spring out for take off and then fold in while driving. The machine was built as part of a U.S. military desire for a 'multi-mission medical and casualty evacuation unmanned air vehicle/unmanned ground vehicle'.","General Robert Cone is head of U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command .

"Steven Gerrard accused Mario Balotelli of showing 'disrespect' for taking the penalty which earned Liverpool a 1-0 Europa League win over Besiktas ahead of Reds captain Jordan Henderson. Balotelli tucked away the spot-kick to earn the hosts' a narrow first-leg lead, but only after an apparent disagreement with Henderson, the captain on the night, and Daniel Sturridge over who would take it. Gerrard, who is injured, was working as a pundit for ITV for the match, and criticised Balotelli for his behaviour.

The 24-year-old watches on as his penalty sends the Besiktas goalkeeper the wrong to put Liverpool ahead . 'Jordan should have taken the penalty. Rules are rules. It should have been Henderson. Mario has been a bit mischievous,' the former England captain said on ITV. 'Credit to Mario, he's scored, but it's not nice to see when footballers are arguing. I think Jordan has handled the situation very well. He can see that Mario really wanted to score. Jordan walked away at the right moment and handled his post-match interview very well. 'Jordan is the captain and Mario showed Jordan a bit of disrespect there, but he's scored a very important goal. I think six or seven players would have wanted to take that penalty so if they all say they are taking it, what happens then? Rules are in place for a reason.' Henderson tried to play down the disagreement after the match, saying: 'I wanted the penalty, Mario felt confident and he has taken big penalties before. Everyone wants to take them. I felt confident in Mario, he has taken big penalties before and he got the nod.' After the match Balotelli took to social media to diffuse the situation and thank Henderson for letting him take the spot kick.

Speaking shortly after his £16million summer acquisition's arrival, Reds boss Brendan Rodgers insisted that he made it clear to Balotelli that he would not be taking penalties when Gerrard was in the team. 'He's brilliant at them - and he knows it,' Rodgers said on the situation in August. 'But Steven Gerrard's the penalty taker. Simple.' The 24-year-old has a formidable record from the spot, not having missed one in 26 attempts for club and country until last September.","Liverpool beat Besiktas 1-0 in their Europa League last 32 first leg tie .

"Roberto Martinez spoke on the eve of this match about his squad 'embracing' the Europa League, the often-maligned competition presenting an opportunity to reboot what has been an underwhelming season. Such European occasions were 'in the club's DNA', said the Spaniard, and they would be doing everything to triumph in the Warsaw final on May 27. Romelu Lukaku, the £28million man who has so often embodied their travails this season, has clearly bought into his vision. Romelu Lukaku (right) gets past Steve von Bergen to head Everton in front after 24 minutes of play . Lukaku celebrates after he opened the scoring for Everton in their Europa League round of 32 first-leg tie . Lukaku taps in Gareth Barry's low fizzed cross to grab his second goal and put Everton 3-1 ahead . The Belgian striker is congratulated by his Toffees team-mate Steven Naismith following his brace . Magnificent last season, when his 15 goals in 31 league matches powered Everton's tilt at the Champions League places, Lukaku hasn't been able to scale the same heights this term. His goals have been fewer and further between, his form patchy on too many occasions. Put bluntly, the Belgian had not played like a club record striker. Not even close. But here, on a freezing cold evening in the Swiss capital of Bern, he was just magnificent. With a splendid hat-trick, plus many other important contributions, Lukaku inspired Everton to the kind of assured European away performance Martinez needs if they are to claim the second European trophy of their grand old history, 30 years after the first. He made light of all the pre-match angst and anxiety - the plastic pitch, the in-form Swiss opposition, the injured troops who hadn't made the trip - with a performance that lifted his team-mates too. Lukaku looks to the heavens after he completes his first hat-trick in Everton colours . Lukaku, of course, has a Champions League winners' medal from his Chelsea days but their 2012 triumph was not one he wished to be associated with. He had not played a minute in their winning run and didn't want to touch the trophy, feeling he had no right to. This is a 21-year-old who wants to write his own history and, who knows, he might sooner that expected. Wearing pristine white moulds on the artificial surface, he was alert and involved right from the first whistle, running off the defenders and generally making a nuisance of himself. On three minutes, he directed a firm header towards the bottom corner from Bryan Oviedo's cross but goalkeeper Yvon Mvogo did very well to tip it around the post. Everton had started brightly and didn't deserve to fall behind through Guillaume Hoarau. But Lukaku led the fightback. His fierce effort from the edge of the box again forced Mvogo into reflex action but he wouldn't be denied a third time. Again Lukaku met an Oviedo cross from the left wing. This time it found the bottom corner, his 11th goal of the season. Seamus Coleman fires in a 28th minute strike to give Everton the lead after Guillaume Hoarau's equaliser . Every time the ball was in his vicinity, he was demanding it, stretching out his arms before him demanding another touch. In the air, he didn't lose a duel all night. And after Seamus Coleman had given Everton the lead, Lukaku added a third before the break. He gravitated to the back post and tapped in after Gareth Barry's low cross fizzed cross. There was an accusation of offside, but the linesman wasn't moved. Out in the Twittersphere, Jamie Carragher joked at half-time: 'Looks like Lukaku will get that move to a big club now.' It was a form of praise for his performance from across the Mersey divide. Early in the second-half, the striker showed his maturity by dragging Ross Barkley away from a flare-up after a late tackle. And the England man soon repaid the favour. Spotting Lukaku's burst, Barkley placed a slide-rule pass and the striker's long legs did the rest. Scorching clear, he deftly lifted the ball past the keeper for his first hat-trick since scoring three past Manchester United for West Brom in Sir Alex Ferguson's last game in May 2013. Lukaku (left) shakes hands with Everton manager Roberto Martinez following his superb display in Bern . He celebrated on his knees, pointing to the heavens, knowing this was a display that would electrify his campaign at last. Everton then threatened to self-destruct, as John Stones saw red for hauling down Hoarau in the box. Fortunately for the English guests, his penalty was high, wide and woeful. With his team down to 10 men, Lukaku inevitably became more peripheral but the work ethic was still there. He earned an ovation from the travelling fans after haring 40 yards to chase what many strikers would deem a lost cause. There was one blot on the copybook, a poor miscue right in front of goal after Luke Garbutt had crossed. When three goals ahead, it's far easier to forgive a miss like that. Likewise with another one-on-one opportunity late on, which drew a flying save from Mvogo. He was replaced seconds later, earning another standing ovation. And how he deserved it after Everton's Swiss roll.","Everton defeated BSC Young Boys 4-1 in Bern .

"Adults who watched a lot of television when they were children are more likely to be overweight, new research has found. For every extra hour a child spends watching TV each day, their weight in adulthood increases by about half a pound. The researchers believe this could be . because when children are watching television their hands are free so . they are able to eat whatever they want - meaning they form bad habits. Adults who watched a lot of television when they were children are more likely to be overweight . ‘The weight of the evidence is pretty strong that television viewing is related to unhealthy changes in weight among youth,’ Jennifer Falbe, who led the research at the Harvard School of Public Health, in Boston, said. She added: ‘It's important for parents to be aware of all the potentially obesogenic screens that they should really be limiting in their children's lives.’ The researchers used data from a long-term study of children who filled in surveys every other year. The surveys included questions about their height and weight as well as how much time they spent watching TV and playing computer games. Out of about 4,300 girls in the study, 17 per cent were overweight or obese. Of the 3,500 boys, 24 per cent were above a healthy weight. For every extra hour a child spends watching TV each day, their weight in adulthood increases by about half a pound . From one survey to the next, each one-hour increase in children's daily TV watching was tied to an increase of about 0.1 points on the body mass index (BMI) scale. Dr Mark Tremblay, director of Healthy Active Living and Obesity Research at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute in Ottawa, Canada, told Reuters Health: ‘[When children watch TV] there is more purposeful, deliberate exposure to eating options, commercials that come on that might cue you to go off to the pantry and grab a cookie or a soft drink. ‘Typically your hands are free when you're watching TV, so should that temptation capture you, you're able to sit there and munch on whether it's a healthy or an unhealthy snack.’ Dr Tremblay, who was not involved in the study, added that even playing computer games could be better than watching TV as it makes children a little bit more active and distracted from eating. Many parents believe their children are getting a reasonable amount of recreational screen time, Dr Tremblay said. But he added that most U.S. and Canadian children exceed the recommended two-hour maximum per day. ‘We don't pay attention to the fact that it's half an hour here, half an hour there, an hour here, an hour there,’ Dr Tremblay said.","For every extra hour a child spends watching TV each day, their weight in adulthood increases by about half a pound - or 0.1 points on the BMI scale .
Could be because when people are watching TV their hands are unoccupied, so they get into the habit of mindless and unnecessary eating, say experts .

"Mario Balotelli was engulfed in another controversy as he became Liverpool’s match-winner in the most dramatic fashion. The Italy striker grabbed the ball from captain Jordan Henderson to take an 84th-minute penalty — a decision that led the injured Steven Gerrard, who was working as a pundit for ITV, to accuse Balotelli of being ‘a bit disrespectful’ to Henderson. Henderson and Daniel Sturridge both appeared to be angry as Balotelli took the ball but he stepped up to score — the 27th successful conversion of his career — and ensure Liverpool have a 1-0 lead to take Istanbul for the second leg of their round of the 32 tie. Mario Balotelli (right) was in disagreement with Liverpool team-mates Jordan Henderson and Daniel Sturridge . Henderson and Sturridge were unhappy that Balotelli took the ball for the late penalty against Besiktas . In an attempt to defuse the row which millions watched on television, Balotelli later said on Instagram: ‘Thank you hendo for let me take the penalty. Stop drama now. We won that’s what counts.’ The incident echoed what happened at Goodison Park on January 19 when Kevin Mirallas took the ball from Leighton Baines but missed from 12 yards against West Bromwich. Brendan Rodgers would not clarify whether Henderson was the designated penalty-taker but Gerrard said: ‘Mario’s been a bit mischievous by going against what the manager has planned. ‘Credit to him — he’s finished the penalty off but it would’ve been very interesting in that dressing room if he had missed. I think we would have had a similar situation to what we had at Everton a couple of weeks ago. But Balotelli scored from the spot to give Liverpool a 1-0 win late on in the Europa League tie . Steven Gerrard said that Balotelli was 'disrespectful' towards Henderson in the ITV Studio . ‘Rules are rules and codes are codes inside a dressing room and when a manager selects a penalty-taker, that penalty-taker should take it. It should’ve been Henderson but fair play to Mario, who was terrific when he came on. ‘With the pressure on his shoulders he slotted it away very well and it’s a big goal for us. ‘Jordan has handled the situation very well. He’s known Mario wants the penalty really badly and is desperate to get on the scoresheet and he’s stepped away at the right time.’ Rodgers said of the penalty, which was won by Jordon Ibe when he was taken down by Ramon Motta: ‘Steven should have taken it! We got the win. We have a number of outstanding penalty-takers.’","Steven Gerrard says Mario Balotelli was 'disrespectul' in taking penalty .

"Falling wages may delay any rise in interest rates, the Bank of England Governor Mark Carney suggested today. Mr Carney revealed he would place ‘particular importance’ on workers’ wages picking up when considering whether or not to increase rates from their historic low of 0.5 per cent. The remarks, which came after the Office for National Statistics revealed wages had fallen for the first time in five years in the three months to June, suggest there may not be any interest rate increase until just before the next election. Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney suggested interest rates would not rise in the near future following disappointing wage growth . The Bank of England this morning downgraded its forecast for average wage increases this year - from 2.5% to just 1.25%. Mr Carney said ‘pay growth has been remarkably weak’ in Britain, but insisted there was ‘no magic number’ that would trigger an interest rate rise. When the Bank does start increasing its interest rates, it will do so in a ‘small, slow’ manner, said Mr Carney added. Despite stagnating wages, the Bank upped its forecast for economic growth this year 3.4 per cent to 3.5 per cent. ‘Sustained economic momentum is looking more assured’, Mr Carney said. ‘The economy is returning to a semblance of normality.’ Chancellor George Osborne has claimed any interest rate rise would illustrate the strength of the economy . Mr Carney also revealed that the Bank of England is making contingency plans in the event of a Scottish vote to leave the United Kingdom. He told reporters that the Bank had plans in place for ‘various possibilities’ and conceded that questions about the future for Scotland's currency could affect financial stability. He said: ‘It is never a good idea to talk about contingency plans in public other than to assure people we have contingency plans."" But he added: ""We don't get a vote on this and we don't want a vote on this.’ Labour said Mr Carney’s remarks showed the people were still struggling despite the economic recovery. Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Chris Leslie said: ‘This report shows why this is no time for complacent and out-of-touch claims from ministers that the economy is fixed and people are better off. ‘While the economy is finally growing again and unemployment is falling, working people are still seeing their living standards squeezed. ‘Pay growth is at a record low and lagging behind inflation and the Bank of England has halved its forecasts for wage growth this year.’ Economists now expect the first interest rate rise to come in February next year, just a few months before the general election. Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said: ‘The report and recent rhetoric from policy-makers gives the impression that rates will not rise until wage growth is showing clear signs of picking up.’","Bank of England halves its wage growth forecast in 2014 to just 1.25% .

"Ligue 1 side Montpellier face a huge bill after its Stade de la Mosson stadium was flooded due to heavy weather in the area. Last week the city was pictured underwater as devastating flash floods created a 'natural disaster' across the south of France. The effects of this have resulted in Montpellier having to cancel their 40-year anniversary party as their ground is submerged with water that has damaged the pitch, gym, changing rooms and offices. French club Montpellier's Stade de la Mosson is badly in need of repairs after the city was hit by mass flooding last week . The effects of the 'natural disaster' has seen the Ligue 1's football ground resemble a mud bath with the football pitch destroyed . Workers are now in force to try and repair the ground, with the club's next home game against Lyon on October 19 . Images from the club's official Twitter account show the full extent of the destruction with the football pitch in particular resembling a mud bath after water rose up to the fifth rank of the stands - about three metres high. At the start of the downpour  up to 12 inches of rain had fallen – almost 50 per cent of Montpellier's average rainfall for the entire year. Montpellier's next game is at home against Lyon on October 19 but that fixture could be in doubt due to the state of their pitch with the club potentially having to look for a new venue while their stadium is being repaired. 'We could play our games elsewhere for a moment,' club president Laurent Nicollin admitted.

First she won style plaudits for her polka dot dress – a £38 number from Topshop, which was a stark contrast to the £1,065 Erdem design she wore in Manchester on Tuesday. Then she, and her ever growing bump, successfully took on husband William in a ‘wand duel’. The couple, accompanied by Prince Harry, were on a visit to the new Warner Bros Studios in Leavesden, Hertfordshire. Kate and William were invited to take a wand each before being shown a few ‘spell techniques’ and being invited to duel. Earlier the party, who were accompanied by 500 guests and children associated with the charities they support, had visited another part of the studios where they were shown props from Batman film The Dark Knight Rises.

When William finally emerged from the . Batmobile after a long while he said, 'I'm a very happy man' but when he . spotted his wife the royal apologised saying, 'sorry, sorry'.

Across the hall the trio met Harry Potter author JK Rowling and producer of all eight movies David Heyman. He said of meeting the royals: 'They all asked about the films -- they really like the films.' He said that Kate was enthusiastic about how the movies attract continue to attract all ages.

"'Deeply shocked': Australian Prime minister Julia Gillard was likened to a quail with 'small breasts, huge thighs and a big red box' on a menu drawn up by the opposition Liberal Party . Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard was said to be 'deeply shocked' today by a sexist dinner menu drawn up by the opposition Liberal Party in which she was likened to a quail with 'small breasts, huge thighs and a big red box'. Details of the menu at a fundraising event in Brisbane were revealed after Miss Gillard's warning that if her Labour Party lost the general election in September, the incoming Liberals would be 'dominated by men in blue ties' and women would be given only minor roles. But her remarks paled into insignificance with the new row over the dinner menu which former Labour Prime Minister Kevin Rudd described as a 'snide, dirty and sexist trick.' Former Liberal government minister Mal Brough who was involved with organising the dinner apologised for what he said was a 'deeply offensive and sexist description' of the Prime Minister. Political observers said the dinner menu's contents had blunted the Liberal Party's attack on Miss Gillard's campaign to warn about about the threat of male dominance in government if the Liberals won the election, as the opinion polls are suggesting. The dinner menu made its unsubtle attack on British-born Miss Gillard under the title of Moroccan Quail. It described the dish as: 'Julia Gillard Kentucky Fried Quail - Small Breasts, Huge Thighs and a Big Red Box.' Mr Rudd, the former Labour Prime Minister who was pushed aside by Miss Gillard in a party room coup in June 2010 but who is rumoured to be planning a fight-back for the top job, was also targeted on the menu. His name was linked to a dish called 'Rudd's a Goose Foie Gras.' Hitting out today, Mr Rudd, who by coincidence was wearing a bright blue tie, savaged Mr Brough for the stunt. 'He's a former minister in the Howard government, number two he's a highly experienced politician, number three he organised the fundraiser which used all these menus, four it wasn't a mistake - he knew it was being used - five he's apologised because he's been found out,' said Mr Rudd. Stunt: The Liberals have apologised for the reference to Miss Gillard on the fundraiser menu (above) Furious: Former Labour Prime Minister Kevin Rudd (right), who was also targeted n the menu, described the stunt as a 'snide, dirty and sexist trick' He suggested that every dollar raised at the fundraising event should now be donated to the RSPCA as a mark of contrition. Liberal leader Tony Abbott was also quick to condemn the menu, calling it 'tawdry'. 'I think we should all be bigger and better than that,' he said. Mr Rudd is being regularly touted as the man preparing himself to challenge Miss Gillard for the Labour leadership and get his old job back as Prime Minister before the September election. He has constantly denied the rumours and he insisted that his decision to wear a blue tie just 24 hours after Miss Gillard had spoken out against 'men in blue ties' was not a declaration of war on Miss Gillard. 'Like most blokes in the country, I have no sense of fashion,' he said. He said he relied on his wife Therese and daughter Jessica to choose his ties and 'this was the one packed for this particular occasion. 'If I had to get ride of all my blue ties I'd lose about a third of them.'","Labour Prime Minister said to be 'deeply shocked' by Liberal Party stunt .

"Six cult members have been arrested over the beating death of a woman a McDonald's restaurant in eastern China on Wednesday night. Only known as Miss Wu, the alleged victim was having dinner at the fast-food outlet when an unknown man, identified as Mr Zhang, asked for her phone number. Once she refused, that's when a very tragic and violent conflict unfolded over a brief 20-minute period. The bashing of Miss Wu took place at a McDonald's in eastern China after she refused to give a cult member her number . Upon the rejection, Mr Zhang used an iron bar to beat Miss Wu to death right in the middle of the eatery. Witnesses told thenanfang.com that Mr Zhang was also having dinner with his friends at Zhaoyuan, in China's Shandong province, when an argument broke out with Miss Wu followed by a physical dispute. The website reported Mr Zhang's friends joined in and also beat Miss Wu, kicking her in the head and she was lying on the ground in a pool of her own blood. They then proceeded to use an iron-handled mop to strike her in the head and continued to do so until the handle broke. Graphic images and a three-minute clip of the beating is circulating online. Mr Zhang was eating dinner with friends before he allegedly beat Ms Wu to death . With Mr Zhang's friends joining in on the alleged assault, kicking her in the head, she was left lying in a pool of her own blood on the ground . Another news site, ecns.cn, reported that Mr Zhang was encouraged by a woman shouting 'beat her to death'. The accused six were arrested on Saturday and police believe they are part of a religious cult. Zhaoyuan police said on their microblog that the members, four of which are from the same family,  belonged to a group calling itself the 'All-powerful spirit' or 'Almighty God' and had been collecting numbers in an effort to recruit new people. The six people allegedly involved in the incident are believed to be cult members and were arrested on Saturday . Emergency crew confirmed that Miss Wu, who has children, died at the scene which occurred between 9.10pm to 9.30pm. No one was reported to have tried to help the victim as video footage of the incident caused an uproar as it showed customers watch the woman scream in agony as she was beaten to death. The McDonald's is located across the street from a local police station. Zhaoyuan is in Shandong province, a traditional hotbed for religious cults. The region gave birth to the violent anti-Christian Boxer movement that laid siege to Western interests in Beijing and elsewhere during the waning years of the Qing dynasty in 1900. It has been reported no one raised the alarm while Ms Wu was being beaten to death with an iron rod . State broadcaster CCTV said religious material had been found at a location linked to the sect but gave no further details. A clerk who answered the phone at Zhaoyuan police headquarters said no one was available to comment on the case. All-powerful spirit, or 'Quannengshen' in Chinese, was founded in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang in the early 1990s and later spread to the country's eastern provinces, the newspaper Southern Metropolis Daily reported. Video and images of the attack are circulating the internet where people can see McDonald's patrons stood idly by as Ms Wu is heard screaming . It said the group promoted a philosophy based on a distorted reading of the Christian Bible and had been banned as an 'evil cult' by the government in 1995, although that could not be immediately confirmed. Another paper, the Beijing Morning News, said 17 members of the group had been arrested in Beijing in December 2012 for harassing people in a public park with claims that the world was coming to an end. China has struggled at times to control grassroots religious movements based on Christian or Buddhist ideology, most notably the Falungong meditation movement that attracted millions of adherents before being brutally repressed in 1999.

"A giant ‘birdcage’ built on top of an apartment block has been ordered to be pulled down. The structure, which includes a giant hook, perch and a fake rock wall, wraps around the fourth storey of the building in the Chinese city of Guangzhou. Built by nature lover Feng Lin, the odd construction has caused outcry from city officials and residents alike. Birdcage banished: The giant 'birdcage' structure built on the fourth storey of an apartment building has been ordered to be pulled down for breaching building permits and causing an outcry from residents . Local officials in the Bantang district have ordered it to be demolished because the structure breached the building’s authorised height of three storeys and residents had complained of falling stones according to reports media. Mr Lin said: ‘I love animals, birds and nature and I was looking for a way of showing it. ‘I got the idea of the cage into my head and I wanted to make it as authentic as possible. It even has perches.’ Fly away home: Nature lover Feng Lin has been ordered to demolish the strange structure which includes a giant hook, perch and a fake rock wall . For the love of birds: Mr Lin said he loved birds and nature so much that he wanted to 'make it as authentic as possible' but neighbours complained that the birdcage was an eyesore and have begged him to take it down . Bye bye birdy: According to media reports, the structure breached the building's authorised height of three storeys and residents complained of falling rocks . One neighbour said: ‘We've begged him to take it down. It is an eyesore. He'll have a giant bell, a mirror and a ladder in there next.’ The owner of the ground floor teahouse said that the enclosure had been built by the landlord according to the Nanfang Daily newspaper. In China, keeping birds is a popular hobby especially among the older population. The ruling comes as other similar rooftop structures sparked a public outcry. In Beijing, eccentric Professor Zhang Lin spent six years building his dream mountaintop villa - on top of a 26-storey Beijing apartment block. He shifted tons of rubble and rock onto the roof of the building to construct the outrageous home which looks like it has been carved from a mountainside. Strange structures: Other odd structures have been seen in China including this 'mountaintop' penthouse which took Professor Zhang Lin six years to build, shifting rocks and rubble to the roof of this 26-storey building . The property even has a rocky mountain garden, complete with rubble and shrubbery. The rooftop home, which never received planning approval, has caused cracks to appear in his neighbours' ceilings and walls while some have had to put up with leaks from broken pipes and drains. They have also been forced to live with the noise and disturbance caused from the building work. One resident said their apartment is constantly flooded while another described the academic as a 'menace'. 'This was originally a small attic when he bought it. But he tore that down and built this mountain on top of us,' said one. Sky high structure: The rooftop home has never received planning approval and has caused cracks to appear in neighbours' ceilings and walls while others have had to put up with leaks from broken pipes and drains . 'He's broken drains so we're always being flooded when it rains and there are huge structural cracks in our ceiling and walls,' they added. Also on a rooftop in Guangdong province, a temple on top of a 21-storey apartment block caused a mixture of reactions. The authorities' decision came after a series of rooftop structures provoked reactions from humour to anger in China, among them a temple on top of a 21-storey apartment block elsewhere in Guangdong province.","Built by nature lover Feng Lin, the 'cage' includes a giant hook and perch .

"Clint Eastwood wowed Republicans with a sardonic, humourous routine on the convention stage in which he interrogated an imaginary Barack Obama  and then declared: 'Politicians are employees of ours...When somebody does not do the job we’ve gotta let them go.' At 82, the Hollywood movie star, director and former mayor of Carmel, California showed he still had an actor’s sense of timing and a wry wit. Recalling the 2008 election, he said: ‘I just thought this was great. Everyone was crying. Oprah was crying . Even I was crying.' But three and a half years later, he said, there were 23 million unemployed. 'That is something to cry for. That is a disgrace. A national disgrace.' Scroll down for video .

Talking to the imaginary Obama, he said: ‘Possibly now it may be time for someone else to come along and solve the problem.' He then mocked him for promising to close Guantanamo Bay and then changing his mind and for having 'the stupid idea of trying terrorists in downtown New York city.' There were guffaws as he told the phantom president: ‘I’m not going to shut up - it's my turn…I can’t tell him [Romney] to do that. He can’t do that to himself.'

Showing his allegiance: Eastwood has publicly talked about his Republicanism in the past, and first dabbled in politics as the mayor of Carmel, California . Within ten minutes, the account had over 4,700 followers. Beyond the jokes, Eastwood did include a . slightly more serious message, criticizing the high unemployment rate . under Obama, and the war in Afghanistan. He assured the crowd that while it . may seem like Hollywood is filled solely with Democrats, that is not the . case. Instead, he said that it was just the modesty of Republicans that . keep them out of the spotlight. 'Conservative people by the nature of . the word itself, play a little closer to the vest they just don't go . around hot dogging it,' Eastwood said.

Comedic chops: For much of the short speech, he had a fake conversation with the empty chair next to him, pretending that Mr Obama was sitting next to him . He went on to give Jon Voight a shout out, as the Academy Award winning actor has been working the convention floor for days. Eastwood spoke quietly and his address, made without notes or a teleprompter, brought down the energy level of the evening after a series of upbeat videos and testimonials from those who know Romney best and before Senator Marco Rubio, 41, of Florida, one of the party’s new generations of stars. Describing Romney as 'a stellar businessman' Eastwood said: 'When somebody does not do the job we've gotta let them go... We don’t have to be masochists and vote for someone we don't like just because they seem to be nice.'

"These remarkable shots reveal just how easy it is to fake dramatic weight loss in just 15 minutes. Australian personal trainer Melanie Ventura recreated her own inspirational weight loss images, posted to her blog MelVFitness.blogspot.com.au, using some clever tricks used by the billion-dollar diet and fitness industries in before-and-after photos. Inspired by personal trainer Andrew Dixon's step-by-step guide to faking a dramatic transformation, Ventura posted two pictures of herself showing the difference a change of lighting and bigger underpants can make in just 15 minutes. Myth busting: Melanie Ventura's 'before' and 'after' pictures were taken within 15 minutes of each other, with the personal trainer using tricks of the trade to give the impression she lost weight . Ventura then explained on her blog how she did it. For her first unflattering picture (left), the trainer ate a big breakfast, wore her tight bather bottoms and let her body sag. But within 15 minutes, Ventura transformed herself into a lean and fit glamazon just by employing these tricks (right). She changed her bather bottoms from red to black, 'cause they're a size bigger . & black is slimming', and 'smothered on some fake tan'. She clipped in long hair . extensions, stood up a bit taller, sucked in her stomach, stood with legs wide and her hand on her 'popped' hip, pulled back her shoulders and wore a 'cheeky' grin. 'Zoomed . in on the before pic- zoomed out on the after & added a filter. Cause filters make everything awesome,' Ventura wrote. 'What's my point? Don't be . deceived by what you see in magazines & on Instagram.You never see . the dozens of other pics they took that wernt [sic] as flattering. Photoshop . can make a pig look hotter then Beyonce. 'I feel like these '2 week progress' pictures set people up with unrealistic expectations of how fast they should be getting results. What a before and after shot doesn’t tell you how the person achieved it.' Illusion: Melanie Ventura transformed herself in 15 minutes using body glow, make up, hair extensions, large black underpants and ditched the phone wallet . Concerned the before and after pictures often used in advertisements don't take account of how people lost weight, Ventura also posted 'a real life transformation photo that took a whole lot more effort than a few hair extensions and some fake tan'. The first picture of Ventura (left) was taken in 2010 on a family holiday after a trip to America where she gained 17 pounds. 'I went to Vegas twice, I tried all the food, I drank almost every night, I went out dancing, I had desserts, and really had the most amazing time,' she wrote. 'Although i remember feeling sh***y about my body in that photo, to be honest I didn’t really care that much- I knew I would lose the weight eventually. 'I had lots of friends, I was confident, I went out all the time and people just gathered around me to soak up my awesomeness.. haha ok ok, maybe not, but I was pretty carefree!' The incredible 'after' photo was taken three years later, when Ventura had 'become obsessed with fitness', teaching eight classes a week as a fitness instructor and then becoming a personal trainer. Over six months, she overhauled her diet, socially isolated herself, stopped weekend drinking and left parties early to gain a six-pack. 'I become totally obsessed with my progress, I had my skin folds done weekly, I trained like a dog and rescheduled my photo shoot 2 times so that I would have ‘more time’ to get leaner,' she wrote. 'By the time the photo shoot finally happened It was almost 6 months later, I was exhausted, Yeah i looked good on the outside- but I was a mess on the inside. I was tired, moody, i'd tainted good friendships and I actually really hated the person I had become [sic].' Real before and after: The picture to the left was taken while Melanie Ventura was on a gluttonous vacation in 2010, while the picture to the right was shot in 2012 when Ventura had lost 15 pounds through disciplined training . Ventura said the best way to change your body is not by buying into the misleading 'two week progress' weight loss shots, but to 'learn about food, come up with an achievable plan and most importantly enjoy how you exercise and live your life.' 'Oh and transformation shots are great, but let it be clear- that being thinner doesnt always mean youll be happier, transformations take time, and good lighting can make buddah have a 6 pack [sic],' she advised.","Australian personal trainer Melanie Ventura shows in pictures how to look skinnier in 15 minutes .

"Taliban militants in Afghanistan have warned ISIS insurgents fighting in Iraq to 'avoid extremism' in a plea for unity among jihadists. It urged the Sunni faction, which has been waging a bloody insurgency against Shi'ite Muslim groups in Iraq, to avoid 'distrusting' other Islamist groups. Commanders of the al-Qaeda-linked group also pleaded with the fighters of ISIS, which recently declared an Islamic 'Caliphate' in its captured territory, to respect the rule of law. Warned: ISIS fighters (pictured parading through Raqqa in Syria) were told to 'avoid extremism' by members of the Afghan Taliban . Fractious: The militant group was urged to join a council with other jihadist factions and not to 'distrust' them . ISIS began life as an offshoot of al-Qaeda, but was disowned by the global terror network after bolstering its strength by merging with other groups in Syria. The call for unity was uploaded to the Afghan Taliban's website this week. It did not name ISIS directly, but clearly referred to the group, who are now thought to be the world's most powerful jihadists. The message, originally in Arabic, said: 'It is worthy for a shurah (consultation) council to be formed from the leaders of all the jihadi factions and the distinguished people among the experts and the scholars in Sham (Syria) in order to solve their conflicts.' 'Muslims also should avoid extremism in religion, and judging others without evidence, and distrusting one another,' it said. 'They should avoid conflict and dispute, and not think their opinions are better than others. Mercy and compassion should prevail.' On June 29, ISIS announced that it had renamed itself the Islamic State and proclaimed its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi their 'Caliph', or head of state. The group had fallen out with al-Qaeda over its expansion into Syria, where it has carried out beheadings, crucifixions, and mass executions. In recent weeks, ISIS has overrun the Iraqi city of Mosul and advanced towards the capital Baghdad. In Syria they have captured territory in the north and east, along the border with Iraq. Taliban spokesmen in both Pakistan and Afghanistan declined to comment on al-Baghdadi's claim to be the global leader of all Muslims. The Afghan and Pakistani Taliban are separate but allied. Armed and dangerous: The well-financed militants of ISIS are the world's most powerful jihadist force . Privately, some commanders said that they did not want to anger al-Qaeda, whom they considered a long-time ally in the fight against NATO troops in the region. Some Taliban, including some of the younger commanders, were enthusiastic about ISIS. Pakistan's own insurgency is on the back foot after the military launched an offensive against the Taliban's key stronghold last month. Most senior commanders are in hiding. Drone strikes have depleted many of the Taliban's and al-Qaeda's most experienced and charismatic commanders. One Pakistani militant commander in his thirties told reporters: 'We are happy with the great efforts of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Dozens of my colleagues from here are with them. Soon Sham and Iraq will be Islamic states'. 'I like the way of fighting ... it is very effective. We need that here in Pakistan. Many of our fighters have gone there.' Another, younger man added: 'We like the modern way of there fighting, it is really a holy war, God send us there.'","Terrorists in Afghanistan posted message urging ISIS to calm down .

"The last Boston bombing victim still in the hospital has finally been discharged - exactly 100 days after the devastating blast left him needing 49 surgical procedures. Marc Fucarile grinned as he left Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital on crutches on Wednesday morning with his fiancee and their son, while doctors and therapists gathered to say goodbye. The 34-year-old roofer lost his right leg, broke his left, suffered severe burns and still has shrapnel lodged near his heart after the second of two bombs exploded near him on April 15. He spent 45 days at Massachusetts General Hospital before transferring to . Spaulding for 55 . days. He has gone to the operating room 16 times, where he has undergone 49 surgical procedures. Scroll down for video . Relief: Marc Fucarile, followed by his fiancee and their son, left hospital on Wednesday - 100 days after the bombs detonated in Boston, claiming one of his legs and leaving him with shrapnel near his heart . Strength: He used crutches as he spoke to the media with his fiancee Jen and their son Gavin . But despite his immense battle and life-changing injuries, he was upbeat as he left the hospital. 'What's the first thing I'm looking forward to doing? Just sit down because my foot's hurting,' he joked as he spoke to the press before he left on Wednesday. 'Just to be with my boy,' he added. 'I know I have the rest of my life - thank you to the people that were there that day. I'd go through 100 more procedures just to be able to go home with him.' His fiancée, Jen Regan, said she was looking forward to having him back home after everything they've missed together. 'Just . the simple things you brush aside, like family dinners,' he said. 'Gavin hasn't . had his dad home for dinner in 100 days. Movie nights, cuddling… I'm . excited, it's really good.' Grateful: Speaking before he left, he thanked those who saved his life on the day of the bombings . Joy: He said he was looking forward to being home for his son, Gavin, whom he is seen touching on the head . Back home: Fucarile hugs Gavin after they returned to their Stoneham, Massachusetts home . Road to recovery: He sits with his fiancee back at his home as he shows his amputated leg . Fucarile still faces further procedures but has been undergoing physical therapy to strengthen his arms, and was able to leave the hospital on crutches. 'Just because I’m going home today, . by no means is that road over,' Fucarile said. 'Boston, please do not . forget about that day, or the people who need you.' Mr Fucarile was watching a friend take part in the marathon with four boyhood buddies from Stoneham, Massachusetts when the bombs went off. After the first . bomb detonated, brothers Paul . and J.P. Norden huddled with Jarrod Clowery, James 'Bim' Costello and Fucraile, not realizing they were inches away . from the second device.

Life changing: Fucarile, pictured with his fiancee Jen Regan in May, lost a leg and broke the other in the blast . Loved: He makes a sad face at his grandmother Mabel Callahan as she visits his bedside in May . When it exploded, both brothers and Fucarile . lost a leg, while Clowery suffered burns and shrapnel wounds and . Costello was hospitalized with serious injuries. Spaulding officials say Fucarile is the last person injured in the explosions to leave a hospital. A firefighter rushed to put a tourniquet on his leg and he was taken to  hospital in a detainee van because no ambulance was . immediately available. In an interview with NBC News in May, he recalled how he pleaded with the firefighter. Relief: He is finally returning to his son Gavin, left, and his fiance Jen, right, for the first time since April 15 . Strong: Fucarile has undergone weeks of physical therapy at Spaulding and faces further procedures . 'I'm like, 'I don't want to die,""' he recounted. '""I . got a little boy and I got my fiancée. I don't want to die."" He's like, ""Just think of them. Just think of them. Keep them on your . mind. Just hang in there"".' It wasn't until a week after the April 15 attack that Mr Fucarile opened his eyes for the first time. He has been constantly surrounded by family - including his fiancée Jen Regan and their son Gavin - who have taken off whole weeks from work to be by his side. Despite their support, Fucarile has previously said his injuries kept him isolated. In . an interview from his hospital bed in May, Mr Fucarile said he . struggles with anxiety and paranoia, aside from the physical pain. Support: His step mother Andrea and father Edward, who have spent weeks in the hospital with him, are pictured after updating the media about his condition just a week after the blasts . Emotional: Jen is surrounded by relatives as she reads a statement at Massachusetts General Hospital in April detailing his injuries, including the amputation, broken leg, burns and shrapnel near his heart . He told the Globe: 'I haven’t really talked to anybody because I don’t want to say the wrong thing being on medication like I am. To heal all the wounds I have. It’s pretty crazy.' His father, Ed Fucarile, was among those who attended the arraignment of bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on July 11, and wore a Boston Strong T-shirt with his son's name on it. The suspect has pleaded not guilty to 30 counts - including killing four people - in connection to the bombings that he allegedly carried out with his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Tamerlan was killed after a shootout with police in Watertown, Masachusettes on April 19, after their images were released to the public. Dzhokhar was captured later that day.","Marc Fucarile was standing with four friends when he was hit by bomb .

"The chief prosecutor in the murder trial of Oscar Pistorius today asked the court to place the double-amputee athlete under psychiatric observation after an expert said he had an anxiety disorder. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel said he had no . other option but to ask for a study of Pistorius' mental health . following testimony by a psychiatrist, who said the Olympic runner's . anxiety could have shaped the way he responded to perceived threats. Judge Thokozile Masipa has not yet ruled on the request. It came after psychiatrist Dr. Merryll Vorster said . events during Pistorius' life, including the amputation of his lower . legs as a baby and his late mother's habit of sleeping with a gun under . her pillow, contributed to his 'increasing stress.' Scroll down for video . 'Traumatic assault': Pistorius was born without fibulas in his lower legs, leading to amputation at the age of 11 months . 'No option': Prosecutor Gerrie Nel said he had no other option but to ask for a study of Pistorius' mental health following testimony by a psychiatrist, who said the Olympic runner's anxiety could have shaped the way he responded to perceived threats . 'Overall, Mr. Pistorius appears to be a mistrustful and guarded person,' Vorster told the court. Testifying . for the defence about his . mental state, Dr Vorster said that because Pistorius had his legs . amputated at such a young age, it would have been impossible to . reason with the baby, making the pyschological scars much deeper. Pistorius was born without fibulas in his lower legs, leading to amputation at the age of 11 months. 'He was too young to understand why,' Vorster told the court. 'His mother could not have comforted him because . he was pre-language phase. It would been perceived as traumatic . assault. Alone: A forensic psychiatrist said that because the surgery was at such a young age, it would have been impossible to reason with the baby, making the pyschological scars much deeper . Tragic: Pistorius is on trial for murder after shooting and killing his girlfriend, 29-year-old law graduate and model, Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year . Pistorius has said . he killed girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp by mistake last year, fearing that . there was an intruder in his home when he fired through a closed toilet . door in the early hours of Feb. 14, 2013. The prosecution says he . killed her intentionally after an argument. But . Dr Vorster said the Olympic athlete displayed 'escalating levels of . anxiety' through his life when she interviewed him this month. She said . she also spoke to members of Pistorius' family, some of his friends and . his agent. Pistorius' defense said at the outset of its case that it would show his feelings . of 'vulnerability' and his disability contributed to him shooting . Steenkamp. Pistorius is charged with premeditated murder and faces 25 . years to life in prison if convicted. Vorster's . testimony also dealt with what she said was Pistorius' fear of crime . and how, because he was a double amputee, he reacted to perceived . threats in a different way to other people. She noted Pistorius' mother, . who died when he was a teenager, slept with a gun in her bed and also . had a fear of being attacked in her home. Insecurity: The psychiatrist also said his parents' divorce when he was a child would have added to the 27-year-old's general feelings of anxiety and insecurity . Cross-examining . Vorster at the start of the eighth week of the trial, prosecutor Nel . asked if she was saying Pistorius had a mental illness and should . undergo a 30-day period of observation, and if he was changing his . defense to one of 'diminished responsibility.' Nel . also asked the psychiatrist if someone who was suffering from an . anxiety order of the kind that she had diagnosed in Pistorius, and also . had access to guns, would be a danger to society. Vorster said the . person would, indeed, be a danger. Talking . specifically about the shooting of Steenkamp, Vorster said Pistorius . was more likely to try and 'fight' what he thought was an intruder than . run away, because his disability meant it was harder for him to flee. Pistorius was on his stumps when he fired four times through the toilet . stall door with his licensed 9mm pistol, killing Steenkamp. Vorster . also said his parents' divorce when he was a child would have added to . the 27-year-old's general feelings of anxiety and insecurity. After . his parents split, Pistorius was brought up by his mother, who died of . cancer when he was aged 15. Pistorius has frequently spoken of his love . for his mother and the difficulty her death caused him. Pistorius competed against able-bodied spinters on carbon-fibre prosthetics, becoming one of the most recognised names in athletics. Besides a clutch of Paralympic medals, he reached the semi-finals of the 400m at the London 2012 Olympics.","Gerrie Nel says 'no option' but to ask for study into Pistorius' mental health .

"Mexican troops have rescued 165 people, mostly Central Americans including children and pregnant women, who were kidnapped by a gunman in Mexico's northeast and held captive less than a mile from the U.S. border, the government said on Thursday. The group of would-be immigrants, primarily from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, had hoped to cross into the United States from the volatile northern state of Tamaulipas. They were captured in batches near the border two to three weeks ago and held in a house in the municipality of Gustavo Diaz Ordaz. Scroll down for video . Mexican troops have rescued 165  migrants that were being held against their will in precarious, dirty, overcrowded conditions in Gustavo Diaz Ordaz . There was also an Indian national among the group. ‘Everything indicates that these migrants were contacted by human traffickers... and these criminals handed them over to criminal gangs instead of taking them to the border,’ government security spokesman Eduardo Sanchez said. ‘They were found kidnapped by an armed individual and held against their will in precarious, dirty, overcrowded conditions,’ he added. The group was rescued on Tuesday. Tamaulipas has been plagued by kidnappings and violence in recent years, and it has long been the site of a turf war between two major drug cartels. The group of would-be immigrants, primarily from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, had hoped to cross into the United States from the volatile northern state of Tamaulipas . Amongst the people rescued were children and pregnant women, who had been kidnapped by a gunman in Mexico's northeast and held captive less than a mile from the U.S. border . In 2010, Mexican Marines found 72 corpses in a ranch near the border in the same state, thought to be the remains of migrant workers. It was the biggest single discovery of its kind during a bloody drug war that has killed an estimated nearly 75,000 people since 2006. Mexican cartels have moved into human smuggling in recent years, kidnapping migrants and extorting money from them or forcing them to carry drugs across the border.","The would-be immigrants had hoped to cross into the U.S. from the northern Mexico state of Tamaulipas .

"A Russian man killed a drinking partner after he and his friends ran out of snacks at a vodka party - then sold the leftovers as pork at a market. The 35-year-old admitted stabbing his fellow drinker, 41, to death before slicing flesh off the corpse, which he cooked and ate, police said. The next day, the cannibal took more meat to a local market on Russky Island, Vladivostok, saying it was pork. Gruesome: After snacking on his victim, the cannibal took more meat to a local market on Russky Island, near Vladivostok, pictured, saying it was pork . A local man bought the meat - but was sickened by the smell as he cooked it. 'He purchased some 'pork', but noticed as he cooked it, the smell was strange,' said investigative police spokeswoman Avrora Rimskaya. 'Despite this he ate the meat, and it tasted strange, too. 'The man then took the meat to the experts, who confirmed that it wasn't from an animal. Hearing this, the buyer immediately took it to the police.' Officers went to his house where the suspect confessed to both murder and cannibalism, she said. 'We got short of snacks to eat with our vodka,' he told police. In his fridge, police found a human head. The remains of the rest of the body were in a garden shed. 'The man is now in detention,' said Rimskaya. She added that two other customers bought the human meat but did not complain to police. In a completely separate incident, also in Russia, a cannibal serial killer who ate his victims' livers has confessed to a string of murders while being interviewed by police as a robbery suspect. Twisted Aleksandr Bychkov, 24 - from Penza in central Russia - has originally been detained over a hardware store hold-up. But as police quizzed him he confessed to at least six grisly murders where he chopped his victims into small pieces and ate their livers before burying their remains near his home. 'We can confirm that cannibalism took place,' one senior local police source told local media. Penza police investigation chief Maria Orlova added: 'At this point we have found six people buried, recovered their remains from the ground, and sent them for examination.'","Local man buys meat, but sickened by smell when cooked .

"This November, mother-of-two Emma Styles and her husband, Paul, are planning a weekend away in Paris to celebrate 30 years of marriage. While for some British couples this would mean a romantic stroll along the Seine and a candle lit dinner for two, for Emma 49, and Paul, 50, it will involve a visit to a Parisian swingers club where anything goes. The couple, from Kew, London, have frequented such sexually liberated establishments for years - and Emma said it has done wonders for their marriage. Open relationship: Emma and her husband Paul enjoy swinging in Paris . She told the MailOnline of their sexcapades: 'Our . marriage has been enhanced greatly by fully enjoying our weekends away. 'In the early days it was a great talking point between us - especially in . the bedroom, where without embarrassment or fear of what either would . think - we could relive moments we'd enjoyed or moments we'd like to enjoy . in the future. Mutual understanding: The couple have been married for nearly 30 years and don't get jealous seeing their partner with someone else . 'I suppose we looked upon it as a kind of hobby, people . would go on gastronomic weekends, cultural weekends (we did many of . those also) we just went on slightly more gratifying weekends.' While Emma said she and her husband always had a happy sex life, it was after a weekend to Paris when she was 29 and they had been married for seven years that they truly had a sexual awakening - after dabbling in sex shows and venues famed for swinging. Since then she has had numerous sexual encounters with married men, women, a distinguished French diplomat and - what she rates among her favourite experiences - a team of French firefighters. As previously reported in the MailOnline, Emma has written about their sexual liberation in a self-published erotic memoir called First Tango In Paris. The book has been climbing up the best-sellers lists on Amazon and Emma has been approached by publishers seeking to produce a hardback version. Tell all: Emma said her sexual awakening began when she was 29 and she had since written a memoir of her sexcapades . She is also working on a sequel that will bring readers up-to-date with the couples more recent experiences. When it comes to her dalliances with other men - and her husband's with other women - Emma said there has never been any jealously or arguments. She said they went into situations with 'their eyes wide open' and always with one another's consent. She explained that at first they established ground rules of 'look but don't touch' but these quickly went out the window when they realised how much seeing their partner with someone else turned them on. Emma writes in her book how this unfolded for the first time when they were approached by another couple in a French club. She writes: 'The atmosphere was electric... and soon a very attractive couple came and stood beside us, very quickly it became apparent that they fancied having some fun with us, right there and then. Frisson: Emma said she and her husband enjoy knowing other people are attracted to them (posed by models) 'She started to run her hand up and down my thigh and whispered something in my ear, I looked at Paul and he whispered ""what about our ground rules?"" I grinned and said ""I'm about to break them... just a tiny bit?"" A look of pure ecstasy instantly crossed his face, and in a blur I found myself being gently kissed by her partner.' Emma explained to the MailOnline that 'jealousy was never an issue' between her and Paul, with whom she two grown up children. She said: 'I feel this is because we had married so young and had grown up and grown into the marriage together and there was never really a his and hers agenda, we simply did things together as one unit.' Speaking of that first encounter that led to many more, she said: 'I enjoyed seeing other attractive women sexually attracted to Paul, safe in the knowledge that he was mine. 'It was a boost to both our ego's that after seven years of marriage, we were both still attracted to and desired by others. In the elegant club environment of Paris, it was the perfect situation to let go of any inhibitions and to act out your wildest fantasies and fulfill any desires you might wish at the time. It was all available and possible.' Explicit: The writer said her book is an honest account of her experiences . Emma said that her double life over the years - juggling being a mother at home and a swinger in Paris - has added frisson to her sexual encounters and marriage. She said: 'The fact it's on foreign soil gave us a sense of bravado as the chance of bumping into anyone you may have had an inappropriate moment with on the Monday morning back in Waitrose was minute to say the least. 'Also we adore the elegance in which the Parisians do things, it's all had a little 'je ne sais quoi'. They seem to have a different attitude to Britain.' Emma admits her book is not 'for the faint-hearted' but she insists every word is true and while some readers may not condone her behaviour, she hopes others may find it inspiring. She said: 'I don't in any way class . my book as pornography but pure and simple factual erotica written for . today's modern woman by a woman who is real and has lived it. 'I hope it inspires women from wherever and whatever age you are, to . embrace your sexuality, and explore fully the deep dark erotic side that . we all have (some hidden deeper than others).'","Emma Styles and her husband started swinging after 7 years of marriage .

"Controversial wannabe glamour model Josie Cunningham has pledged to bid on Katie Price’s silicone breast implants if they go up for auction. The 24-year-old, who had a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS, said she would bid on the star’s implants because she wants to have both the first and second ‘most famous’ boobs in the country. The unemployed mother of three’s vow came after Miss Price said she wanted to sell the implants from her six boob jobs in an attempt to raise money for breast cancer charities. Scroll down for video . Wannabe glamour model Josie Cunningham (left) has pledged to bid on model Katie Price’s silicone breast implants if they go up for auction because she wants to own the 'most famous' boobs in the UK, after her own . The 24-year-old took to Twitter to reveal she would be bidding on Miss Price's old implants if they went on sale . Miss Cunningham, from Leeds, who recently gave birth to her third child, took to her Twitter page to reveal her intentions to bid on the model’s assets. She wrote: ‘OMG I’m deffo going to be bidding on @MissKatiePrice boobs! I’ve got the most famous t*ts in the country. Only fair I have the 2nd as well. (sic) She later added: ‘I’ll be the first one bidding.’ Yesterday, The Sun revealed how Miss Price was considering selling her silicone implants as she prepares to undergo her seventh boob job. The 36-year-old mother of five, who wants another operation to ‘perk’ up her boobs after having her recent daughter Bunny, told the newspaper: ‘I love them but I’d sell them in The Sun for a breast cancer charity. 'You could have these very breasts right from inside me in a few weeks. ‘I can even sign them with a marker pen.’ She also revealed how she keeps her silicone implants in a safe at her home in West Sussex. Miss Cunningham, from Leeds, recently gave birth to her third child (pictured leaving hospital with the newborn) Ms Cunningham shot to notoriety last year when she had an NHS-funded operation to increase her bust from size 32A to 36DD, claiming she had been bullied since she was 14 for having a flat chest. She has since gone on to make a name for herself over the past 12 months by selling a number of stories, including how she received Botox on the NHS for a 'sweat problem' and debated aborting her baby for the chance to appear on Big Brother. She has previously admitted to not knowing who the father of her newborn child is, claiming she fell pregnant while working as a £1,000-a-night escort. At one point, the former escort tried to placate public opinion by promising to pay back the cost of her NHS-funded breast augmentation but admitted she could not uphold her pledge when she fell pregnant. She continued to soak up public funds for some time afterwards, by receiving state-funded transport to take her children to school because of the 'negative attention' she receives on public transport. However, Leeds City Council eventually decided to axe the service, prompting Miss Cunningham to Tweet: ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones but taxpayers will always fund me.’ Josie Cunningham became a household name when she admitted undergoing £4,800 worth of breast enhancement surgery paid for by the NHS to increase her bust from a 32A to 36DD. She claimed she needed the surgery because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested. Later it also emerged that she received Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'. Miss Cunningham's most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting her child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother. The mother of three later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school. She made headlines again when she said she wanted a nose job - funded by the public. She set up a website called fundmynose.co.uk to encourage people to donate towards the £3,000 cosmetic operation. The 24-year-old claimed she was fed up of people comparing her to The Muppets’ Miss Piggy and now wants a brand new nose which is a ‘cross between Michelle Keegan and Jennifer Aniston’. It came after the former escort, who previously worked a stint as a £1,000-a-night prostitute, told female students 'not to worry' if their exam results were not quite what they were hoping for. The former escort made headlines after having £4,800 breast enlargement surgery paid for by the NHS . Ahead of A-level exam results being released in August, she tweeted: 'Good luck to everyone getting your A-level results today. Girls don't worry if ur results are poor - you can always (cont). 'have a career getting your t***s out or escorting. (Obviously if your over 18!). #Josie'sCareerAdvice.' During her pregnancy, the former escort stepped out with a Girl Power painting sprawled over her bump before announcing she would be setting up a trust fund to pay for her daughter's boob job. She had previously suggested she would reimburse the NHS for the cost of her own controversial breast enhancement surgery. Using the hashtag #BritishPublic0JosieCunningham1, she said she made the decision because '80% of the country are against' her. It came after she had earlier spoken of her devastation when doctors told her she was having a third boy. She admitted she smoked a whole packet of cigarettes and drank one glass of wine after the other because she felt 'genuinely gutted'. Afterwards, she decided to sell tickets to the live birth of her child. Four tickets to the home birth sold out in just 14 minutes - netting her £30,000. It is thought that three of the four tickets were purchased by journalists while the fourth is believed to have been bought by somebody described as 'a super-fan'. She later said that 50 fans would be able to log on to the video chat service Skype and watch the former prostitute's delivery via videolink. But, earlier this month, despite saying some of the money would go back to the NHS, she had a change of heart when she found out she was having a girl.","Wannabe glamour model has vowed to bid on Katie Price's silicone implants .

"Customers have complained to clothing giant Matalan after the chain used two black children to model monkey outfits. The apparent slip-up features in the popular out-of-town retailer's new catalogue on a page advertising children's animal onesies. It prompted one Twitter user to accuse the firm of racism, while another customer complained the image was extremely unfortunate, deliberate or not. Unfortunate: Customers complained over a Matalan catalogue which featured two boys (one of whom is pictured) in monkey onesies. Both boys were black, while the other six children wore rabbit and ladybird outfits . The two youngsters - both in ape suits - were pictured alongside six white boys and girls dressed as rabbits, a ladybird and a character from the smartphone game Angry Birds. A 40-year-old father reported the image to The Sun, complaining: 'We're living in a sensitive time and you'd have thought someone would have realised how bad this is.' The image also did not go unnoticed on Twitter. One user, @FlyyBlkGrl, wrote: 'Flicking through my @Matalan book & I come across this...they really put the Black kids in the Monkey Onesies?! #Rude'. Another, Andrew Sneddon, tweeted to the firm: 'I'm finding it quite racist'. The retailer however said it was disappointed the photograph had been perceived in this way. 'We regularly work with the two boys and they chose the outfits they wanted to wear, as did all the other children on the shoot. 'Their parents were with them the whole time and they all really enjoyed the day. It is very sad that some people have turned this into a race issue,' a spokesman said. 'Rude': One Twitter user uploaded an image of the catalogue to express her disbelief at the image . Racist caricatures of black people as monkeys date back more than 100 years, when they were used in cartoons and postcards to dehumanise the people they mocked. Earlier this year the Belgian newspaper De Morgen apologised for running a digitally altered photo of U.S. President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle, which was designed to make them look like monkeys. Matalan has more than 200 stores, most of which are large and outside town centres, and made sales of £1.12billion last year.","Photograph in new catalogue showed eight children in animal costumes .

"It does not get any worse than this. It simply could not. This was one of the worst days in the history of English one-day cricket. It is impossible to exaggerate the size and multitude of England’s defeat at the hands of New Zealand here. If England’s humiliation at the hands of Australia last week was bad then this was much, much worse. Within seven days they have been systematically dismantled by not one but two World Cup hosts playing a completely different game. And however good the Aussies and Kiwis have been that is unacceptable. It is hard to remember a more one-sided game than this.

Okay, at times like this it can be easy to resort to hyperbole and think of the latest woeful capitulation as being the worst you have seen. But can anything have been as bad as this for England? Ever? The grim statistics tell you all you need to know – England were brushed aside for 123 in 33.2 overs having been 102 for three after 25 and then overtaken by New Zealand in just 12.2 overs. If it were not so embarrassing it would be laughable and it is hard to see how England can recover from this. They play Scotland in Christchurch on Monday and can afford no further slip-ups if they are to reach the quarter-finals, let alone compete in this World Cup. And the damage done to some of the England players, not to mention the regime who have been trying to pick up the broken pieces of English cricket for over a year since the Ashes, could be irreparable. England were always going to struggle against Australia and New Zealand in their opening two games. It would be unrealistic to think anything otherwise with a team playing catch-up in the demands of modern one-day cricket. But to lose so emphatically, so gruesomely and without any glimmers of encouragement was almost cruel. More than cruel, it was obscene. And it left English cricket squirming in disbelief. Credit where it is due. New Zealand were magnificent here in their capital city and Tim Southee produced a truly great spell of fast bowling to rip the heart out of the feeble English batting. It was close to the perfect performance. This is not the New Zealand we have become accustomed to in recent years. They are no longer the dark horses or the gallant, but not quite top class, triers. They are one of the best, most aggressive and potent teams in this tournament. England's captain Eoin Morgan walks off the ground with his team-mates after losing to New Zealand . Joe Root gets to his feet after diving to make his ground as the only England player to emerge with any credit . In Brendon McCullum they have the best, most aggressive and most imaginative captain in world cricket and an awesome presence at the top of the order, as he showed with a spectacular display of hitting when he had England on the floor. This was a special day for New Zealand cricket and their hugely impressive captain who thrashed England for 77 in just 25 balls with seven sixes and eight fours. Yes that’s right. He hit 77 off 25 balls whereas the best England could muster was Joe Root’s 46 as everything fell apart around him. Men against boys. But no England side should be beaten as comprehensively as this. Not by any side in the world game. Not with all their money and resources, all the expertise at their disposal and all the tradition and history of their cricket. We had to sit through last year’s Ashes for heaven’s sake so that the calendar could be changed and England could have an unprecedented run of one-day cricket to try to make sure they were as thoroughly prepared as possible to compete in this World Cup. Please do not laugh when you read that. Eoin Morgan is lost for words in the field. Steven Finn went for 24.50-an-over during his time with the ball . Yorkshireman Joe Root was yet again the only batsman to show any sort of application . James Anderson didn't know where to turn as he was being carted to all corners of the ground . Gary Ballance checks his bat after a dismal display out in the middle for England . New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum later hit the World Cup's fastest half-century in history . How pathetic that seems now. It has meant nothing. Not unless England can somehow rise from the canvas and begin their World Cup all over again now the spectre of facing up to the big two has been taken away from them. For now they have much, much to contemplate. They had no answer to the brilliance of Southee after Eoin Morgan had gone against his instincts and decided to bat first even though the ball was swinging round corners in practice. Four of Southee’s seven wickets were clean bowled, at least two of them in Ian Bell and Moeen Ali dismissed by absolute beauties, and when he had finished he had the best one-day international figures in New Zealand history and the third best of any side in any World Cup. The game was over then as a contest but the humiliation was only just starting. For McCullum absolutely murdered them with an eye on New Zealand’s run-rate, showing no mercy to his close friend Morgan and inflicting every ounce of damage possible on Steven Finn in particular who went for 49 off two overs. McCullum powered his way to a stunning 77 off just 25 balls in a blistering 40-minute spell . Opener Martin Guptill congratulates McCullum after he reached his half-century in double-quick time . Adam Milne took a stunning catch to dismiss captain Morgan after a stuttering display . Stuart Broad was given a lesson by McCullum in his first over . It was all over by 6.30pm even though, absurdly, the match had to stop for supper when New Zealand needed just 12 runs for victory. At least those spectators in the 30,000 sell-out crowd at this rugby stadium who had decided to come to the match after work had a little more cricket to see. New Zealand will take some beating in this tournament but that is no consolation for England. They head south to Christchurch with their reputations on the line and with Peter Moores having to show more than ever in his troubled two spells as England coach that he belongs at this level. A game against Scotland, with England’s World Twenty20 winning captain in Paul Collingwood in their ranks, suddenly becomes the most important game in the lives of this England side and their coaches. They cannot afford to fail now.","England were bowled out for just 123 batting first in Wellington .

"A US oil boom is set to push America past Saudi Arabia to become the world’s top producer. Driven by high prices and new drilling methods, the US production of crude oil is on track for the biggest single-year gain for more than 60 years. Analysts claimed yesterday that, if the growth in domestic drilling continues, America will soon overtake Russia and Saudi Arabia – and possibly become ‘the new Middle East’ in another decade. The boom has surprised even the experts. Scroll down for video . On the up: The U.S. is set to become the world's biggest oil producer following a recent boom in output . ‘Five years ago, if I or anyone had . predicted today’s production growth, people would have thought we were . crazy,’ said Jim Burkhard, head of oil markets research at US energy . consulting firm IHS CERA. Production is expected to rise by 7 . per cent to hit an average of 10.9million barrels a day this year. Energy Department officials say it will average 11.4million next year, . just below the current Saudi output of 11.6million. This will be the fourth straight year of crude increases and the biggest single-year gain since 1951. And Citibank forecasts it could reach 13million to 15million barrels per day by 2020. But it has not led to cheaper petrol. Prices are expected to stay relatively high for the next few years . because of growing demand in developing nations and political . instability in the Middle East and North Africa. The last year the US was the world's largest producer was 2002, after the Saudis drastically cut production because of low oil prices in the aftermath of 9/11. Cost: The oil boom is, however, not expected to ease the cost of gasoline for hard-pressed U.S. motorists . Boom: US oil production has increased for four years in a row and is expected to rise to 11.4 million barrels a day in 2013. On current trends it could soon overtake Saudi Arabia's output . Since then, the Saudis and the Russians have been the world leaders. Americans currently use around 18.7 million barrels per day - but thanks to the growth in domestic production and the improving fuel efficiency of the nation's cars and trucks, imports could fall by half by the end of the decade. The increase in production has not translated to cheaper gasoline at the pump, and prices are expected to stay relatively high for the next few years because of growing demand for oil in developing nations and political instability in the Middle East and North Africa. Still, producing more oil domestically, and importing less, gives the economy a significant boost. Increased drilling is driving economic growth in states such as North Dakota, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Montana and Texas, all of which have unemployment rates far below the national average. Businesses that serve the oil industry, such as steel companies that supply drilling pipe and railroads that transport oil, are not the only ones benefiting from the boom in production. Homebuilders, auto dealers and retailers in energy-producing states are also getting a lift. The oil and gas drilling boom, which already supports 1.7 million jobs, is expected to lead to the creation of 1.3 million jobs across the U.S. economy by the end of the decade. 'It's the most important change to the economy since the advent of personal computers pushed up productivity in the 1990s,' says economist Philip Verleger, a visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics. The major factor driving domestic production higher is a new found ability to squeeze oil out of rock once thought too difficult and expensive to tap. Engineers have learned how to drill horizontally into long, thin seams of shale and other rock that holds oil, instead of searching for rare underground pools of hydrocarbons that have accumulated over millions of years. Competition: Saudi Arabia and Russia have led world oil production in recent years (file picture) To free the oil and gas from the rock, drillers crack it open by pumping water, sand and chemicals into the ground at high pressure, in a process known as hydraulic fracturing, or 'fracking.' The US oil boom has also been influenced by a long period of high oil prices and the recovery of production in the Gulf of Mexico following the 2010 BP well disaster and oil spill. The most prolific of the new shale formations are in North Dakota and Texas. Activity is also rising in Oklahoma, Colorado, Ohio and other states. Production from shale formations is expected to grow from 1.6 million barrels per day this year to 4.2 million barrels per day by 2020. That means these new formations will yield more oil by 2020 than major oil suppliers such as Iran and Canada produce today. From 1986 to 2008, crude production in the US fell every year but one - dropping by 44 percent over that period. The United States imported nearly 60 percent of the oil it burned in 2006. By the end of this year, US crude output will be at its highest level since 1998 and oil imports will be lower than at any time since 1992, at 41 percent of consumption. Whether the US supplants Saudi Arabia as the world's biggest producer will depend on the price of oil and Saudi production in the years ahead.","U.S. production to rise 7 per cent this year to nearly 11 million barrels a day .

"The mother of James Foley, the American journalist beheaded by ISIS, spoke tonight of her deep disappointment felt towards the Obama administration for their handling of his time as a prisoner of the terror group, saying, 'I really feel our country let Jim down.' On the 13th anniversary of 9/11 and the day after President Obama addressed the nation and finally offered a strategy to defeat ISIS, Diane Foley told CNN that 'as an American', she was 'embarrassed and appalled' at the efforts to rescue her son from captivity. Articulate and thoughtful throughout her interview, Mrs. Foley made the startling claim that US officials threatened her family with prosecution if they tried to raise a ransom for Foley, 40, and said 'Jim was sacrificed because of a lack of communication and prioritization.' And in a thinly veiled attack on Obama's new strategy to 'degrade and destroy' ISIS she said that meeting violence with more violence may not be the answer and said, 'bombing caused Jim's death.' 'Jim was killed in the most horrific way. He was sacrificed because of just a lack of coordination, lack of communication, lack of prioritization,' said Diane Foley. 'As a family, we had to find our way through this on our own.' Scroll down for video . Failure: Diane Foley told CNN that she felt extremely let down by the US government's handling of her son's capture and rescue . Still grieving, Diane Foley also said US officials told her they would not exchange prisoners or carry out any military action to try and rescue her son. At times withering in her assessment of the Obama administration's co-ordination with her family, Mrs. Foley poured scorn on the Pentagon's claim they tried to rescue Foley on July 4, only to raid the wrong base. Speaking to CNN's Anderson Cooper, Mrs. Foley said her family knew where James Foley was being held on two separate occasions in Syria, and that each time he was there for months following his capture on Thanksgiving, 2012. She bemoaned the fact that a military option took so long to put together and felt the whole disastrous operation, which Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel surprisingly labeled 'Flawless', was in fact 'awful'. In a damning indictment of the effort at home and abroad to rescue Foley, who was kidnapped in northern Syria while working for GlobalPost, Mrs. Foley said that the FBI were asking her family for information on her eldest son. 'We tended to know everything before the FBI or anyone else. .... Everyone was kind and supportive, but the FBI used us for information,' she said. Devastated: Diane and John Foley talk to reporters, on Wednesday August 20, 2014 outside their home in Rochester, New Hampshire. The day before shocking footage of their son's execution was posted online . Asked why this was, Mrs. Foley said, 'Because we did everything we could.' Throughout the 20 month ordeal, Mrs. Foley said she came to regard her and her family's efforts to rescue James as 'an annoyance' to the administration and began to feel that their desperation to bring James Foley home did not 'seem to be in the strategic interest, if you will.' White House spokesman Josh Earnest said during his daily briefing with reporters on Friday that Foley's rescue was indeed a 'priority' to the administration as evidenced by the 'high-risk mission' carried out by the administration to find recover him. Earnest claimed that the mission 'was successfully executed' even though it did not bring about the release of Mrs. Foley's son. The Obama spokesman said he was not in 'a position to detail the kinds of conversations' that took place between the Obama administration that the Foley family, however, and directed questions about the threat of prosecution to the Department of Justice. Speaking generally, Earnest confirmed that it is the policy of the administration not to pay ransoms. That policy stops terrorist organizations from having a stream of funds and it keeps Americans safe, he said. The State Department's Deputy spokesman Marie Harf was a more forthcoming during a briefing with reporters that afternoon, explaining that it is 'part of our job' at State to help families understand the laws about paying ransom to terrorists. She confirmed that the Foley family asked questions about those laws while their son was being held hostage and that the government provided them answers. 'But this department would never and did not not ever intend to, nor do think we ever did anything that we would consider threatening,' she said. She later said that 'everything that we do is driven by what would be best for the hostages. Period. Full stop. Absolutely.' Captured and executed: James Foley was taken hostage on Thanksgiving, 2012, while working for GlobalPost in northern Syria and executed - video of the brutal act was released online on August 19 . US freelance reporter James Foley was kidnapped in war-torn Syria in November, 2012 and executed by his ISIS captors in a video posted online on August 19 of this year . Strategy: President Barack Obama addresses the nation from the Cross Hall in the White House in Washington on Wednesday and said he had authorized U.S. airstrikes inside Syria for the first time, along with expanded strikes in Iraq, as part of ""a steady, relentless effort"" to root out Islamic State extremists . On August 19, ISIS released a gruesome video online which showed the beheading of Foley by a masked ISIS militant, who told the camera in a British accent, that his 'real killer' was the United States. Exactly two weeks later, another American journalist, Stephen Sotloff, was beheaded, apparently by the same man, who tells the camera, 'I'm back Obama'. During the efforts to get James home, Mrs. Foley said she met good people, people who wanted to help, but was adamant that she didn't want to single anyone out and lay 'blame'. Mrs. Foley said it was important to remember that ISIS is the enemy and not the United States. However, ultimately, she 'didn't feel that Jim was a priority.' 'We were just told to trust that he would be freed somehow, miraculously,' said Foley's mother to CNN. 'And he wasn't, was he?' Speaking to CNN's Anderson Cooper, Diane Foley said that she felt cut off at every avenue by US officials and were threatened with prosecution should they try to pay for her son's return - a move that left her feeling 'horrified'. Still startled by this aggressive enforcement of official US policy, Mrs. Foley said she couldn't believe it because 'no one has ever been prosecuted for trying to get their child back.' Mrs. Foley said that of course she had watched the president's address to the nation on Wednesday night, but said that the US needs to reconsider its position on negotiating with terrorists. 'I pray that our government will be willing to learn from the mistakes that were made,' she said to CNN, 'and to acknowledge that there are better ways for American citizens to be treated.' 'This whole strategy to eliminate ISIS and the terror threat is important, obviously, so perhaps part of the strategic way of doing that is to bomb them, and to engage in force. But that only caused Jim's death,' she said. 'I guess all I'm trying to say is that our government needs to be shrewder, smarter, willing to negotiate with these people who hate us, so that we can find better ways to rid ourselves of terror.' On Wednesday night from the White House, the president said of ISIS, 'They enslave, rape, and force women into marriage. They threatened a religious minority with genocide. In acts of barbarism, they took the lives of two American journalists -- Jim Foley and Steven Sotloff.' Three weeks after Foley's death, the president finally outlined his strategy to defeat ISIS, after weeks of mixed messages, including admitting at one point that he had 'no strategy' for the militant group. In response, US National Security Adviser Susan Rice said that she felt the Foley family had done an 'amazing job....to bring Jim home safely' and that she 'and others in the US government worked very hard with Diane Foley and her family to try to be supportive, to try to provide what information we could.' She denied the mission to rescue him was a failure, despite the special forces team assaulting completly the wrong ISIS camp. 'Unfortunately, they were no longer there,' said Rice. 'But I think that effort ... underscores the importance that we attach to doing everything that we possibly can to bring Americans in captivity back home.'

"Not for the first time Roy Keane has crossed a line that leaves him in extremely dangerous territory. If he offended the fair-minded majority in his first autobiography with the admission that it was his intention to severely injure Alf-Inge Haaland in 2001, his reflections in his latest book, The Second Half, will spark yet more controversy. Roy Keane (left) has released his new autobiography, The Second Half, and it has some explosive content . Keane revisits a lot of the things he talks about in his first autobiography but he also deals with new incidents . I wouldn't have missed a drug test like Rio . How I headbutted Schmeichel and gave him a black eye . I don't regret the tackle on Haaland . He didn't even own the bloody thing - Keane on the Rock of Gibraltar dispute . I knew Ronaldo would rule the world . On Clive Clarke’s heart attack . He admits to an ‘evil thought’ about the former Sunderland player, whose career was cut short by a heart attack when he was on loan at Leicester in 2007. He admits to using news of Clarke’s sudden illness to deflect the attention away from the 3-0 defeat his Sunderland side had just suffered against Luton. ‘I said that football results didn’t really matter,’ he writes. ‘And I had the evil thought, “I’m glad he had it tonight,” because it would deflect from our woeful performance.’ He also concedes that, having once joked that he was surprised ‘they’d found a heart’, he ‘sometimes forgot’ he ‘wasn’t the only person with parents and children’. The darkness of Keane’s thoughts are no less shocking however well we already thought we knew the volatile former Manchester United captain. Talented and intelligent Keane undoubtedly is. But this second book, skilfully ghosted by Roddy Doyle, offers the kind of insight that will disturb as much as it fascinates. Some might say he is simply being honest, but here is yet another example of nobody being there to save Keane from himself. The Haaland passage was apparently missed by his advisers all those years ago and here, now, is the result of Keane handling all aspects of the latest book himself. This follows his split from Michael Kennedy, a lawyer he once said he trusted with his life. Clive Clarke  suffered a heart attack while on loan at Leicester City against Nottingham Forest in 2007 . Keane was managing Sunderland at the time and they were humbled 3-0 at Luton Town on the same night . Revisiting that Alf-Inge Haaland tackle . The Haaland episode was every bit as shocking; not least because of Keane’s warped sense of justice. He said he was still angry with Haaland for accusing him of play-acting when he was writhing in agony - with what was actually a cruciate injury - after kicking out at the then Leeds midfielder in 1997. So four years later, with Haaland playing for Manchester City, Keane plants his studs on Haaland’s knee. ‘I’d waited long enough,’ wrote Keane in that first book. ‘I f****** hit him hard. The ball was there (I think). Take that you c***. And don’t ever stand over me sneering about fake injuries.’ The FA responded by banning Keane for five matches and fining him £150,000. In the latest book he insists he is not the least bit sorry. Manchester United midfielder Roy Keane (right) lunges towards Manchester City's Alfe-Inge Haaland (left) Keane's right boot smashes into the knee of Haaland during the Manchester derby in 2001 . Keane stands over Haaland and shouts at him following his thigh-high lunge on the defender . ‘There are things I regret in my life and he’s not one of them,’ writes Keane, and how depressing an attitude that is. He might have the ability to inspire, and we might sometimes admire him for his fearlessness. For instance, Keane was still the United captain when he used a newspaper column to suggest his employers had treated Jaap Stam like a ‘piece of meat’ when the defender was sold to Lazio. Keane suffered a cruciate injury against Haaland's Leeds  in 1997 and the defender accused him of play-acting . Keane's first book (left) was controversial but his second has gone even further . But it is the thought processes that are as alarming as they are intriguing. Take this one, for instance, on the club car he returned when he left Old Trafford. ‘I’d given back the (club) car,’ he writes. ‘I drove some f****** miles in that car. Every little victory is vital.’ Anyone who has had an acrimonious split with an employer will relate to that. They will probably find it funny, too. But coming from Keane it just offers us further evidence of how angry and aggressive an individual he can be. He offers strong opinions on anyone of note he has encountered. The Class of 2014 . Now here is a group who don’t impress Keane. ‘I wonder about the current United dressing room,’ he writes. ‘I look at the current players and they should be doing a lot better. ‘Not liking a manager can never be an excuse for not going out and doing your best. Looking at what happened to David Moyes, I can only conclude that he didn’t have a strong dressing room. He had a weak dressing room.’ Ouch. The current crop of Manchester United players 'should be doing a lot better' than they are in Keane's opinion . Peter Schmeichel scrap . The Danish goalkeeper was significantly bigger than Keane but that did not stop the Irishman leaving his colleague with a black eye after headbutting him during a drink-fuelled clash on tour. ‘Peter had grabbed me, I’d headbutted him - we’d been fighting for ages,’ Keane reveals, nevertheless saying that he ‘admired’ the goalkeeper. He explains: ‘I had a bust-up with Peter when we were on a pre-season tour of Asia. There was drink involved. The manager had a go at us as we were getting on the bus, and people were going on about a fight in the hotel the night before. It started coming back to me - the fight between me and Peter.’ Roy Keane (right), pictured here arguing with his team-mate Peter Schmeichel (third from right) in 1995, has admitted leaving the goalkeeper with a black eye after a fight during a pre-season tour to Asia .

He admires the former Arsenal captain too, and admits the towering Frenchman ‘would have killed me in a fight’ when they clashed in that infamous tunnel incident at Highbury in 2005. Angered by the sight of Vieira apparently ‘trying to bully’ Gary Neville, Keane exploded with rage. ‘I just thought: “The f******”. They were trying to bully him. They were a big team and, in the tunnel, they were even bigger. So I said to myself “Alright, let’s go”.’ Keane had an infamous tunnel bust-up with then Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira at Highbury in 2005 . Vieira (right) is someone who Keane admits he does respect though, and he thought he would get beaten up . Rio Ferdinand’s missed drugs test . As a player Keane rated Ferdinand. But he was less impressed with the then United centre half when he received an eight-month ban and a £50,000 fine for missing a drug test at the club’s training ground in 2003. ‘He suffered for it and so did the team,’ recalls Keane on Ferdinand. ‘If it had been me, and the doctor had said I had to do a drugs test, I’d have gone and done it. It wasn’t something I’d have forgotten. ‘It wouldn’t have been like collecting a letter at the office, or remembering your boots. When a doctor says you’ve got to do a drugs test, it’s not an everyday thing.’ Keane also says he cried in the car when he drove away from United one last time. But he has kind words for some too: . Rio Ferdinand (right) congratulates Roy Keane after his goal against Leeds United at Elland Road in 2003 . Rio Ferdinand pictured in 2004 after failing in his appeal against an eight-month ban for a missed drugs test . Cristiano Ronaldo the grafter . He recalls with some amusement how United’s first encounter with a then 17-year-old Ronaldo in a friendly against Sporting Lisbon left John O’Shea needing medical attention for ‘dizzy spells’. ‘We always joked with Sheasy he had actually sealed the deal by playing like a f****** clown,’ writes Keane of Ronaldo, who was signed after the game. But he admired Ronaldo enormously. ‘I liked Ronaldo straight away,’ he writes. ‘He was 17 but he was immediately one of the hardest working players at United. He was good looking and he knew it. Looking at some of the other players in front of the mirror I would think: “You f****** nugget”. But Ronaldo had an innocence to him.’ Cristiano Ronaldo caused John O'Shea to have 'dizzy spells' when Sporting Lisbon faced Manchester United in a friendly, claims Roy Keane in his autobiography 'The Second Half' Keane (centre) and Ronaldo (right) became team-mates after United signed Ronaldo . TV’s such an easy gig . Keane once said he did not have the phone numbers of his United team-mates. He also said he was not comfortable having visitors at his house, that view having been expressed after a surprise visit from then Republic of Ireland manager Mick McCarthy. But Keane says he enjoyed the company of Lee Dixon and Adrian Chiles when he was working for television. Not that he considers such work terribly challenging. ‘It’s an easy gig,’ he writes. ‘I don’t like easy gigs. When I heard: “I liked your commentary last night”, I knew I was only talking bull**** like the rest of them. Hopefully my bull**** was a bit better.’ His latest offering will certainly have an impact.

"An early morning wake-up call prank went horribly wrong for a couple of bumbling CNN anchors when they had phoned a total stranger. Ashleigh Banfield and Zoraida Sambolin, the co-hosts of CNN’s new morning show Early Start orchestrated the prank to pull on comedian Chuck Nice in California, where it was 3:40am. But it wasn’t Chuck Nice. It was someone else who was speaking Spanish and was extremely confused by the call. Scroll down for video . And it was all going so well ...: The frown on the face of Early Start co-host Zoraida Sambolin (right) indicates she sensed from the get-go that something was wrong, but Ashleigh Banfield kept the joke going . As Ms Sambolin suspected that they were not speaking with Mr Nice at all, Ms Banfield kept going. When the bumbling pair reached Chuck Nice, pictured, he revealed he had been watching CNN all along and saw the prank fall flat . 'Chuck this is the FBI calling,' she said, before erupting in a fit of chuckles. But her laughter was cut short as she finally realized they were not speaking with the comedian. Ms Banfield asked: 'Is this Chuck Nice?' but got only silence. Red in the face, she got up from her chair, saying: 'Know what, Zoraida, you're taking this one'. Ms Sambolin tried to smooth things over. She said: 'Disculpe! We didn't mean to call you so early in the morning. We apologise, whoever you are.' Ms Banfield eventually returned to her seat in a state of disbelief. 'I totally don’t believe we just got a wrong number. Poor guy has no idea he was just on CNN'.

"They're the bane of A-listers everywhere thanks to their long lenses and gift for catching a celebrity during moments they would rather the public didn't see but the origin of the paparazzi are more glamorous than the modern incarnation would suggest. Now a new exhibition is to turn the lens on some of the first paparazzo, who documented the golden age of Italian cinema, provoking outrage from their A-list subjects and adoration from the public who devoured their work. But it's not all Bieber-style paparazzi dust-ups: The 80 photos set to go on display at the Estorick Collection from 30th April also offer a glimpse of the dolce vita or 'sweet life' enjoyed by Italian movie stars and Hollywood royalty working in Rome during the 1950s and '60s. Public holiday: Brigitte Bardot surrounded by paparazzi during a holiday in Spoleto, June 1961 . The two decades were a golden era in Italian film when directors such as Michelangelo Antonioni, Pier Paolo Pasolini and Federico Fellini produced some of their most famous films, including the latter’s iconic La Dolce Vita (1960). So successful was the Italian film making industry, Hollywood stars such as John Wayne, Charlton Heston, Lauren Bacall and Liz Taylor flocked to Rome, along with directors lured by the comparatively inexpensive Cinecittà studios. In the Roman studios, some of the biggest films of the age, among them Ben-Hur (1959) and Cleopatra (1963) were shot. In the evenings, however, a different type of camera lens took over, with photojournalists with an eye on the bottom line unable to resist the lure of the A-lister packed bars and restaurants that lined the city’s exclusive Via Veneto. Private moment: Richard Burton and Liz Taylor kissing in Ischia, June 1962 and photographed by Geppetti . Arrival: A Geppetti shot of Carlo Ponti, Sophia Loren and Vittorio De Sica, arriving at a Rome restaurant in 1961 . One of the most skillful was Marcello Geppetti, whose photos vividly evoke an era of extraordinary glamour, creativity and decadence. Geppetti, who died in 1998, eventually amassed an archive of more than a million images, many featuring period heavyweights such as Brigitte Bardot, Elizabeth Taylor and Audrey Hepburn. And Geppetti was unique in another way too, making the decision early in his career to sell his work to press agencies rather than direct to papers in much the same way that paparazzi do today. Initially, he was employed by the Meldolesi-Canestrelli-Bozzer agency, then one of the most high-profile of its kind, where he earned a a reputation both for the technical quality of his images and his talent for capturing dramatic, eye-catching moments, before going freelance. Ironically, Geppetti made his name with harrowing images of a fire at the Hotel Ambasciatori on Via Veneto: the very street that would later provide him with arresting imagery of a quite different nature, as he travelled along it on his scooter on the lookout for celebrities. Portrait of a film star: Audrey Hepburn (left) and Raquel Welch and Marcello Mastroianni on set (right) Intimate: Jane Mansfield and Mike Hargitay papped enjoying their supper in Rome, September 1960 . Ready to work: Rock Hudson and Cary Grant at photographed outside the Cinecittà Studios, June 1961 . Suppertime: Richard Burton dining with friends at a restaurant in Trastevere, Rome, June 1963 . Many capture moments when, as he put it, 'the ordinary coexisted with the extraordinary’, as in his image of Liz Taylor wandering with a friend through the streets of Cinecittà dressed as Cleopatra, or the actor Mickey Hargitay riding down the Via Veneto on horseback. One of his most famous shots is that of Richard Burton kissing Liz Taylor while holidaying in Ischia, a photograph recently listed among the 30 most famous images in history, alongside works by Andy Warhol and Cecil Beaton. Yet despite the loveliness of his work, the celebrities he photographed considered the behaviour of the paparazzi as intrusive then as they do today. Glamorous: Swedish actress Anita Ekberg driving a Mercedes through the streets of Rome in May 1962 . Romance: Jane Mansfield and Mike Hargitay leaving Piccola Budapest, Rome, October 1962 . Attack: Like Bieber, Franco Nero, seen here hitting Rino Barillari at the Trevi Fountain, was no fan of the paps . One photograph captures the actor Franco Nero in the act of assaulting Geppetti’s fellow paparazzo, Rino Barillari, at the Trevi Fountain, while another series of images show Anita Ekberg in her stockinged feet confronting another paparazzo with a bow and arrow before attacking him with her fists. While the A-listers they followed loathed them, Geppetti and his ilk produced some of the most iconic images of the 1950s; cementing Hollywood's place in popular culture in the process. Love them or loathe them, there's no denying that the paparazzo - and the public who adored them - changed the face of photojournalism forever. The Years of La Dolce Vita begins on the 30th April and runs until the 29th June at the Estorick Collection of Modern Italian Art. For more information, see estorickcollection.com .

"Five years after TV and film actress Mo'Nique won an Academy Award for her tour-de-force performance in the drama Precious, she finally found out why she wasn't being inundated with attractive offers like other Oscar winners. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, which appears in the magazine's February 27 issue dedicated to Gone With The Wind actress Hattie McDaniel's historic Oscar win in 1940, Mo'Nique revealed that it was director Lee Daniels who finally explained to her why her career went in the direction that it did. The actress said she's learned that she was being punished for refusing to lobby the members of the Academy for votes and for not playing by Hollywood's rules. 'I got a phone call from Lee Daniels maybe six or seven months ago. And he said to me, ""Mo'Nique, you've been blackballed,""' the former star of the sitcom The Parkers recalled. Scroll down for video .

Sidelined: Mo'Nique said she got a call from Precious director Lee Daniel (left) last year, who told her that the Hollywood community was not happy with her . Speaking out: Mo'Nique took to Twitter to address the 'blackballing' comment in The Hollywood Reporter story . 'And I said, ""I've been blackballed? Why have I been blackballed?"" And he said, ""Because you didn't play the game.""' When the 47-year-old comedian and actress asked the Oscar-winning director of Precious what game he was speaking off, Daniels reportedly declined to elaborate. In a statement to the magazine, Lee Daniels later clarified his 'blackballed’ comment, explaining that Mo'Nique's unwillingness to actively participate in the Precious campaign in the run-up to the Academy Awards ceremony 'soured her relationship with the Hollywood community.' Mo'Nique also said in the lengthy interview with the magazine that she got an undeserved reputation in Hollywood for being 'difficult.'

According to the Baltimore native, she's been labelled ‘tactless’ and ‘tacky’ by some in the film industry, but she said that's only because as someone who grew up in a blue-collar family, she refuses to let anyone take advantage of her. On Thursday, she took to Twitter writing: ‘To be BLACKBALLED or ostracized 4 ur views is a scary thought, however to say silent about what u see is scarier. #faceyourfears’ Over the past five years, Mo'Nique said she's been passed up for a number of plum roles in major TV and film projects, including Lee Daniel's The Butler, his prime-time Fox drama Empire and the upcoming Richard Pryor biopic, in which she was slated to play the ground-breaking comedian's grandmother. ‘Each of those things that he offered me was taken off the table,’ she said. ‘They all just went away.’ In 2009, Daniels cast Mo'Nique in the family drama Precious, based on the book Push by Sapphire. A year later, she won a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for her heart-wrenching and terrifying portrayal of the title character's abusive mother.

"While many parents turn to toys and lullabies to soothe their babies, the latest parenting trend forbids these crutches, instead encouraging us to treat children like adults. Resources for Infant Educarers, also known as RIE and pronounced 'wry', was founded in 1978 by early childhood educator Magda Gerber, who advocated respect between a parent and child and said adults should allow their children to solve problems without interference. The parenting trend - which promises more competent and self-aware children in the long run - has already taken hold among celebrities including Jamie Lee Curtis, Tobey Maguire and Penelope Cruz, but some experts warn it could do more harm than good. Mini grown-ups: The latest trend in parenting is Resources for Infant Educarers, also known as RIE and pronounced 'wry', which advocates treating babies and children like adults . RIE teaches that instead of artificial . and constant distractions like toys and sports classes, babies need . relaxation and natural stimulation to fully develop. Deborah . Carlisle Solomon's new book, Baby Knows Best, is the most recent . incarnation of the RIE parenting guide based on Gerber's teachings. According to an Amazon description, . the book explores 'babies' natural abilities to develop at their own . pace, without coaxing from helicoptering or hovering parents'. The . list of typically baby-related things banned according to orthodox RIE . followers is extensive, from baby bouncers, sippy cups and high chairs . to rattles, pacifiers, baby talk and toys. 'Children don’t need toys,' Ms Solomon writes in her book. 'Almost all of the toys at RIE can be found in somebody's cupboard.' Enthusiast: Tobey Maguire (pictured in November 2013 with daughter Ruby) is one of the many celebrity believers in RIE, which discourages the use of high chairs, toys, pacifiers and baby talk . Pacifiers are also looked down on since, as Gerber once wrote, 'the pacifier is a plug. It does stop a child from crying, but the question is, Does an infant have a right to cry?' Instead of trying to soothe a baby with tickling, lullabies or rocking them to sleep, RIE dictates that parents should let them cry as long as they want. The idea is that babies and children . know much more than we give them credit for, and they should . therefore be treated with respect as fully-functioning humans. As such, it advocates that baby talk . should be replaced with long, adult conversations - a concept that goes . against a recent study by researchers at the University of Washington . and the University of Connecticut. Good advice: William H Macy and wife Felicity Huffman (pictured with daughters in March 2013) are also proponents of the parenting method, which was originally developed in the 1940s by Magda Gerber . Understanding your kids: Penelope Cruz (pictured in June 2012), who, with husband Javier Bardem, practices RIE, has said: 'Children perceive everything. They are really smart' According to the study's co-author Dr Patricia Juhl, it . found that 'the prevalence of baby talk in one-on-one conversations with . children is linked to better language development, both concurrent and . future.' 'The pacifier is a plug. It stops a child from crying, but doesn't an infant have a right to cry?' Indeed, the more parents exaggerated . vowels - for example 'How are youuuuu?' - and raised the pitch of their . voices, the more the one-year-olds babbled, which is a forerunner of . word production. Despite this conflicting theory, many proponents of RIE - including . Penelope Cruz - say its teachings are the key to successful parenting. The 39-year-old actress, who has two children with her husband Javier Bardem, told the Wall Street Journal in December that she is a devoted follower of the parenting technique. Self-improvement: And according to Jamie Lee Curtis (with daughter Annie in 2010): 'RIE takes you back to basics. RIE makes us all better. Better parents. Better partners. Better people' 'Children perceive everything,' she said. 'They are really smart.' And Jamie Lee Curtis, whose two adopted children are now 17 and 27, told Vanity Fair: 'RIE takes you back to basics. RIE makes us all better. Better parents. Better partners. Better people.' How-to: Deborah Carlisle Solomon's book, Baby Knows Best, published on December 17, is the most recent RIE parenting guide . Nevertheless, problems can arise in that RIE doesn't allow a parent to interfere with their child, even if he or she is in a fight. Author Annabelle Gurtwich told Vanity Fair about a time that her child was attending an RIE snack time with other children, one of whom 'started shoving huge tables at the babies on the floor'. At first, the mothers, though panicked, simply sat back and watched since they were supposed to never interfere. 'Finally, I stood up and said, ""Are you f****** kidding me? This is dangerous,""' explained Ms Gurtwich. 'I picked my kid up and took him out of the circle, and all the other mothers followed.' Still, it's not just trend-concious celebrities who have sung RIE's praises; all five reviews of Ms Solomon's book on Amazon are gushing. 'Parenting is the hardest job there is,' wrote one enthusiast. 'And this book has the antidote to so many of the traps and dysfunctional patterns that families get stuck in because of lack of awareness.' Another said the book is 'an interesting comment on how each of us can simplify and improve our relationships by assuming all individuals, as well as babies, are competent and can make good decisions.'","Resources for Infant Educarers, also known as RIE, promises more competent and self-aware children in the long run .

"Eddie Williams (pictured) was kicked out of the college earlier this year after being arrested for a series of robberies . A former Alabama University football star allegedly admitted to having sex with his former high school teacher, who wanted to have his baby. Top rated defensive back Eddie Williams, 20, is said to have admitted the affair with his high school athletic director Karissa Wesley, 35, after they became close when she tutored him. Williams said he had sex with Wesley 'about 10 times' when he visited her house. Another student, who was present and heard them having sex, told police he ended the affair when Wesley talked about having Williams' baby. Williams, who was kicked off the Alabama squad earlier this year after being accused of taking part in a robbery on campus, said the affair took place in his senior year. Williams at first denied the affair - but later confessed, according to Major Tommy Ford with Bay County Sheriff's Office. Details of the alleged affair emerged as Wesley was suspended from her job as Athletic Director at Arnold High School in Bay County, Florida. A former coach at the school is reported to have told school board members about the affair while school chiefs received an email from a former teacher Peggy Dawson. Authorities said Dawson's email included a hand written letter from former football player Andre Allen who alleged that Wesley and Williams had sex. Allen was referred to as student B while Williams was student A in a subsequent investigation. The e-mail said that Williams smoked marijuana with Wesley on multiple occasions, stayed the night and drank alcohol with them. Williams' confession to the affair was released by police to TV station WMBB. The statement from Allen was also released along with an investigation by school chiefs. Police said they plan to take no further action as Williams was aged over 18 at the time of the offence. The allegations of drug use are past the statute of limitations for prosecution. Wesley has strenuously denied the affair and issued a statement to WMBB TV. She said:'I deny all allegations in the letter. I want to thank the Arnold students, especially the volleyball players, administration and faculty, parents and community for the outpouring of prayers, love and support.' The school district investigation found that Wesley is in a relationship with the school's Football and Basketball Coach, Bobby Britton.

Wesley also admitted to the affair. The District said the relationship is in violation of the district's supervisor-subordinate relationship policy. Superintendent Bill Husfelt is recommending Wesley's termination at board meeting on Tuesday. Williams was considered the top player in Florida when he chose to join Alabama University, known as Crimson Tide. The Defensive Back was kicked out of the college earlier this year after being arrested for a series of robberies. He was also charged with possession of a firearm. He is currently awaiting trial.

"It's a country known for it's relaxed way of life - so much so, that citizens fiercely treasure the siesta tradition of napping during the day. And now researchers believe that they have found a reason for Spain's sleepy stereotype - the country is in the wrong timezone, forcing its residents to rise an hour earlier than they they should. A new parliamentary report blames the fact that Spain is stuck in Central European time - which means running one hour ahead of daylight - for everything from low work productivity to gender gaps. The document by a parliamentary commission said that 'Spain for more than 71 years has not been in the correct time zone' The time zone is unusual because the Mediterranean country sits in the middle of the Western European time zone, the one that Portugal, Morocco and Britain belong to, the BBC reported. The report argues that Spaniards' sleeping patterns are based around the 'artificial' time zone, but their work hours follow the daylight time. So citizens will work until the daylight begins to end, despite going to work an hour earlier, the Washington Post reported. The report's authors recommend that the government move Spain's daylight hours to accord with the Western European time zone - which could see an improvement in work productivity and stress levels. The report argues that Spaniards' sleeping patterns are based around the 'artificial' time zone, but their work hours follow the daylight time . The document by a parliamentary . commission said that 'Spain for more than 71 years has not been in the . correct time zone', the BBC reported. The reason for the country's peculiar time zone compared to their neighbours occured in 1942, the Spanish dictator General Franco moved Spain onto Central European Time to follow Nazi Germany. Unlike the UK, which changes its clocks twice a year, Spain sticks to one time. In the past American researchers have studied the impact of daylight saving on a person's health - and discovered that moving the clocks backwards and forwards can wreak havoc on the body. In 2012 they found that the abrupt change to a person's daily schedule increased the risk of having a heart attack by 10 per cent. This impact isn't felt on the Sunday morning as most people adapt their weekend schedule and rise a little later. However, the risk peaks on Monday when workers have to get up at a set time to get to the office. When the clocks go back in October the risk of heart attack decreases by 10 per cent. 'Exactly why this happens is not known but there are several theories,' said Professor Martin Young at the time. 'Sleep deprivation, the body's circadian clock and immune responses all can come into play when considering reasons that changing the time by an hour can be detrimental to someone's health.'","Spain is in Western European time zone but follows Central European zone .

Researchers believe this could lead to people taking the compound like a daily vitamin to stop the condition from developing. Type 2 diabetes affects more than two million Britons and is linked to lifestyle (picture posed by model performing diabetes test) The findings have huge implications for the UK where there are at least 2.5million Britons who suffer from the disease. The compound, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), plays a vital role in the way cells use energy. Scientists in the US were able to normalise blood sugar levels in diabetic mice by injecting them with the chemical. At the same time the jabs lowered raised levels of cholesterol and triglyceride blood fats. The researchers are now working on a way of administering NMN to mice in drinking water. 'Once we can get a grade of NMN that humans can take, we would really like to launch a pilot human study,' said study leader Dr Shin-ichiro Imai, from Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis. RISK FACTORSIf you have two or more of the following, see your GP for a simple blood test... CLASSIC WARNING SIGNS . For many, the first signs of diabetes are symptoms caused by complications. So also watch out for the following... Type 2 diabetes, the most common form of the disease, is linked to an unhealthy lifestyle. The U.S. scientists triggered the condition in young, healthy mice by feeding them a high-fat diet. All had reduced levels of a molecule called NAD that harvests energy from nutrients and turns it into a form cells can use. In both mice and humans, NAD is derived from NMN made by cells via a chain of biological reactions. One of NAD's effects is activation of SIRT1, a protein that has been shown to promote healthy metabolism throughout the body. Although NAD is too toxic to be administered directly, the scientists were able to raise its levels in mice by injecting them with NMN. After the treatment, the animals showed dramatically improved responses to glucose. In the case of female mice, tests showed their ability to move glucose from the blood to organs and tissues had returned to normal. Male mice also showed an improvement, but were not completely normalised. The gender difference might be explained by hormonal effects, the scientists believe. Dr Jun Yoshino, also from Washington University, who co-authored the research published in the journal Cell Metabolism, said: 'I'm very excited to see these results because the effect of NMN is much bigger than other known compounds or chemicals. 'Plus, the fact that the body naturally makes NMN is promising for translating these findings into humans.' In older mice, around 15 per cent of healthy males fed a normal diet also developed diabetes. Glucose response improved in these animals after just one injection of NMN. The same treatment had no adverse effects on older mice not suffering from diabetes. Few elderly female mice developed the disease unless they were switched to a high-fat diet. 'Again, when we injected these females with NMN, we came up with a completely normal glucose tolerance curve,' said Dr Kathryn Mills, another member of the Washington University team. 'We can also see that the NMN has completely reversed and normalised the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and free fatty acids.' People with a good supply of vitamin D have a lower risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, a study has found. Researchers at the Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, in Germany, said the vitamin could have an anti-inflammatory effect. Study author Dr Barbara Thorand, said: 'In the winter months people often do no receive adequate supplies of the vitamin because of a lack of sunlight. 'If follow-up studies confirm out results, a targeted improvement in the supply of vitamin D to the public could also reduce the risk of developing diabetes.' Oily fish, eggs and milk products all contain vitamin D. The results will be published in the journal Diabetes Care.",More than 2.5million Britons suffer from Type 2 diabetes .

"Michael Vick is in the dog house again after a series of . shocking revelations made public this week in a tell-all book written by his . former mistress. ‘Quarterback Keeper’ details the secret 10 year relationship . between the former stripper and the Philadelphia Eagles quarterback, including . revelations about group sex parties in his home, flights around the country for . clandestine hook-ups and even a surprising card he sent her from prison. First reported by RadarOnline, which obtained a copy of the final manuscript, the book even dishes on an STD . scare and the crushing end to their hush-hush relationship. Tell-all: Michael Vick's former mistress spilled the details on the decade-long affair in a book she is shopping to publishers . The book’s author has refused to reveal her real name, going . under the pen name Bella Escritor, but the seemingly innocent puppy faced card . sent from Mr Vick is addressed to a Kiana. The front is adorned with two huggable puppies and the words . ‘Thinking about our friendship.’ Mr Vick and the woman saw each other under the table while . he was publicly dating now-wife Kijafa Frink. The former Atlanta Falcons franchise player asks her about . pictures and tells the mistress the two puppies on the front are she and him – . he was in prison for running a brutally violent dog fighting operation. He then tells her he . wants ‘a bag full of candy and some eye candy’ when he finishes his prison . sentence. He repeatedly refers to her as family despite their . relationship being a secret, and then tells the exotic dancer he has her  heart and to keep the card for future . memories. ‘You my girl for life no fakin [sic],’ he wrote. Little did he know the card would be added to a collection . of memories woven into a tell-all treasure trove of debauchery and heartache. Surprising: Mr Vick sent his mistress a card with two puppies on it while serving a prison sentence for running a dog fighting operation . Back on the gridiron: Mr Vick was cut by the Atlanta Falcons after the dog fighting accusations were made public, but he soon found a home with the Philadelphia Eagles after being released from prison . A call placed by MailOnline to Mr Vick’s agent seeking comment . was not immediately returned. The book also details the star-crossed couple’s first . encounter at the Atlanta club where she stripped. ‘He said only one word, ‘dance,’ and that’s exactly what I . did … Vick appeared to take it all in like a child in a candy store for the . very first time,’ she recalled, according to RadarOnline. That night would be the first time they slept together in . his Atlanta home. They continued to see each other for the next decade. He . always insisted she use flavoured condoms, she recalled. Despite using protection, she became concerned for her own . health while the former Virginia Tech standout was sued in 2010 for allegedly . giving a woman herpes. Back on top: Mr Vick was briefly back on top of the world as a starting quarterback with another $100million contract signed only two years ago with the Eagles . On the outs: Mr Vick struggled mightily this year and was benched in favor of a backup quarterback who appears to have taken the starting role from him . The mistress tested negative, and Mr Vick denied having the . STD despite settling with the woman out of court. He hinted at the time that he . threw money at the accuser to keep her quiet because he had much bigger fish to . fry. The Bad Newz Kennels dog fighting operation would bring him . crashing down to earth only two years later. The mistress also detailed group sex parties that saw the . star player bring hordes of women to his home to have sex with friends – with . him and Bella Escritor watching. ‘Once we returned to his house, we would separate and watch . the others partake in sex sessions throughout the mansion,’ she wrote, . according to RadarOnline. ‘Vick and I would sometimes crawl on the floors and sneak . into people’s bedrooms together and watch them having sex’ until they were . caught and would run out. The relationship came to a dramatic ending when the former . first overall pick’s wife contacted Bella, she immediately confessed to . everything. ‘I knew it was over for Vick and me the moment I decided to . talk woman-to-woman with [his other girl],’ she wrote. ‘Somehow I felt a sense . of relief.’ The former mistress said she doesn’t regret meeting the . polarizing player, but doubts she’d do it all over . again.","'Quarterback Keeper' dishes all the dirty details on the pair's decade-long affair .

"Do you wish that your weekend was longer than just Saturday and Sunday? According to the world's richest man, it should be. Carlos Slim Helú, the Mexican telecommunications mogul worth approximately $79.6 billion, told attendees to a business conference in Paraguay on Friday that it was time for 'a radical overhaul' in people's working lives. As of July 15, 2014, Forbes announced that Slim was the richest man in the world, edging out Bill Gates' $79.1 billion fortune. According to Slim, 74, people should take more time off in the course of their professional lives, working only three days a week instead of the standard full-time five days per week. Carlos Slim, 74, advocated for three-day work weeks for workers, claiming that the extra to pursue hobbies and other activities would be beneficial to peoples' quality of life . 'People are going to have to work for more years, until they are 70 or . 75, and just work three days a week – perhaps 11 hours a day,' Slim told the conference, including the catch that not only would workers have to work longer days (11 hours instead of the usual eight), but would have to continue to work well into their 70s, an age many opt to retire before reaching. However, according to Slim, the benefits for such a short work week are plentiful. 'With three work days a week, we would have more time to relax; for quality of life. Having four days [off] would be very important to generate new entertainment activities and other ways of being occupied,' he told the conference. To a certain degree, Slim has been applying this train of thought to his own businesses. According to the Financial Times, Slim's phone company Telmex has implemented a system where workers on a collective labor contract who joined the company in their late teens can retire before they reach 50, and can continue to work for full pay four days per week. Slim (pictured standing) is the richest man in the world, surpassing Bill Gates with a fortunate of $79.6 million . Slim also applies this philosophy to his own work life. He is still active as a businessman at his age, 74. He also maintains a life full of hobbies, such as art collecting. He opened the Museo Soumaya, an art museum dedicated to both his love for art and religious relics as well as the memory of his late wife, Soumaya Domit. At the same meeting, Slim also commented on the state of education, saying that education should 'not be boring, but should be fun' and that students should learn 'not to memorize but to reason; not to domesticate but to train'.","Carlos Slim, worth $79.6 billion, told a business conference in Paraguay that workers should work three days per week, 11 hours a day, and retire later .

"In a crime described by authorities as 'vile' and 'inhuman,' a New Jersey woman was buried alive in a shallow grave by her landscaper after he offered to drive her to buy a new car, police said Thursday as he and another man were arraigned on murder charges. Fatima Perez was reported missing on Monday evening, the same day she left her Camden home to buy the car. The body of the 41-year-old woman was found Wednesday in Monroe Township, about 20 miles away. Perez's mouth and eyes were covered with duct tape before she was buried, authorities said. An autopsy determined she died of asphyxiation. Scroll down for video . Buried alive: New Jersey woman Fatima Perez was buried alive in a shallow grave by her landscaper after he offered to drive her to buy a new car . Landscaper Carlos Alicea-Antonetti, of Camden, and one of his employees, Ramon Ortiz of Pennsauken, told investigators they buried her alive, according to authorities. Both men applied for public defenders at their arraignment, where they were ordered held on $5 million bail each. Investigators said Alicea-Antonetti, the owner of Villa Coamo Landscaping and General Maintenance, picked up Perez on Monday in his van to drive her to buy the car. As Camden County Assistant Prosecutor Christine Shah described the horrific crime, Perez's family wept openly in court, The Courier-Post reported. Perez had about $8,000 on her for the purchase. She accepted a lift from Alicea-Antonetti, who was known to her family and had done landscaping work at her home. Speaking to investigators later, he claimed she fell out of his van during an argument then got back in regardless of the injury. He admitted to then picking up Ortiz, and said the two men later bound Perez and taped her ears and mouth shut. Ramon Ortiz, left, 57, of Pennsauken, and Carlos Alicea-Antonetti, 36, are arraigned on murder charges in the slaying of Camden resident Fatima Perez . Oritz's statement differed, claiming that Perez was already tied up when he entered the van. He also claimed she begged him for help while they headed to the rural area where she'd be buried. He further said that Alicea-Antonetti directed him to take a shovel and dig the gave off of Clayton Road. 'Ortiz stated that Ms. Perez was placed in the grave, covered with lime and buried,' according to the court record. Both men agreed she was alive when they buried her, according to police. They covered the grave with branches and debris to try and hide it, then left. They were arrested Wednesday when police received a tip they were hiding in an Express Inn. Alicea-Antonetti had $7,000 on him when he was arrested. Ortiz allegedly took police to the grave later that Wednesday morning. Both men have criminal histories. Alicea-Antonetti pled guilty to aggravated assault in an April 2006 domestic violence case involving choking his wife while Ortiz was convicted of drug-distribution charges in 1993 and 1995 with each case resulting in a three-year prison sentence. He was convicted on two more drug-related crimes in 1999 and 2002. Each man faces life without parole in Perez's death. Grieving: Family members of Fatima Perez weep as they listen to the arraignment of Ramon Ortiz and Carlos Alicea-Antonetti . Perez's family declined to address reporters after the hearing, though her mother's cries could be heard filling the hallway outside the courtroom. Camden City Council President Frank Moran called it 'a time of hurt for the whole community.' And Camden County Police Chief Scott Thomson said the nightmarish homicide has touched his department's men as well. 'As . with all our missing person cases, the detectives' mission is to return . the person to their loved ones as quickly as possible' he said. 'It's . probably not mentally healthy how emotionally invested the detectives . become with their cases, but that's what makes them . exceptional.' He later said detectives worked on the case 20 hours straight, allowing themselves only four hours for sleep. 'I . know that upon the finding of Fatima's body, it cast a pall over the . entire investigative bureau, as hearts were very heavy for the family,' he said.","The body of Fatima Perez, 41, was discovered buried Wednesday .

"A man who survived without a heart for a record two years has described how ‘incredibly lucky’ he feels after undergoing a successful transplant. Matthew Green, 42, was the first Briton to be discharged from hospital with a completely artificial heart. It meant the pharmaceutical consultant had to carry around a rucksack containing a battery-powered pump attached by tubes to his chest everywhere he went. Life-saving: Matthew Green was the first person in the UK to receive a total artificial heart implant and be able to go home thanks to a portable pump, right . Cutting-edge technology: Matthew leaving Papworth Hospital, Cambridge with son Dylan and wife Gill, seen carrying his heart pump . The pioneering operation was his only hope of surviving after he was hours from death through pressures on his fatally diseased organ. But now after almost two years, he has received a donor heart and is recovering in hospital. Mr Green, who lives with his wife Gill and seven-year-old son Dylan in London, said he has been granted a ‘third lease of life’. Speaking from Papworth Hospital in Cambridgeshire where he is expected to be discharged soon, he said: ‘I feel incredibly lucky that I have been given a third lease of life as a result of my heart transplant. ‘It’s hard to put into words the gratitude I feel to my donor and their family. They have helped me turn my life around again. Pioneering: Matthew's rucksack allowed him to leave the house for three-hour periods at a time . Innovative: Papworth Hospital, Cambridge is the UK's leading heart and lung transplant centre and fitted Matthew's artificial heart in a £100,000 operation . Miraculous: The device Matthew used is generally in service for around three years, during which it beat more than 200million times . ‘I want to thank all the amazing . staff at Papworth Hospital who have cared for me and I want to urge . anyone who is thinking of registering on the NHS organ donor register to . do it.’ Mr Green had . been in a critical condition after the main chambers of his heart failed . and no suitable donors could be found in July 2011. With his health deteriorating fast, specialist surgeons at Papworth decided to fit him with the device in a £100,000 operation. Some . parts of the Total Artificial Heart have a 50-year working life, . although patients are generally expected to use it for up to two years - . during which it will ‘beat’ more than 200million times. The . rucksack contained a 14-pound battery powered pump that allowed him to . leave the house for three-hour periods at a time. It costs . £20,000-a-year to maintain. Its US makers warn that using it more than two years because of the risk of blood clots building up. Dr Denton Cooley implanted the first experimental device in Haskell Carp at St Luke's Hospital in Houston in 1969. The patient died three days later.Following animal testing in the 1970s, the next operation took place in 1982 when the Jarvik 7artificial heart was transplanted into a dentist called Barney Clark. 198 operations followed.By 2001 the first completely self-contained total artificial heart was implanted in Robert Tools at the Jewish Hospital in Louisville.And in 2008, Charles Okeke was implanted with the SynCardia Total Artificial Heart, becoming the the first patient to leave hospital with an artificial heart in May 2010.Since then the SynCardia Total Artificial Heart has been used in more than 900 implants in 65 hospitals. There had been trouble finding a . heart donor large enough to power Mr Green’s 6ft3in frame, but one was . found last month - just before the two-year period ended. It means Mr Green has the record for the longest time living outside of hospital with a completely artificial heart. Steven Tsui, clinical director of . transplant services at Papworth, said: ‘I am delighted that we were able . to find a suitable donor heart for Matthew to have a heart transplant . and I expect him to go home very soon.’ Before the initial operation to fit an artificial heart, Mr Green spoke of how the external pump would transform his life. He . was diagnosed with Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy, a . disease of the heart muscle that can cause arrhythmia, heart failure, . and sudden death. The . exact cause of the condition - the second most common reason for sudden . death in the young - is unknown, although it appears to be passed on . genetically. He said in . 2011: ‘It feels very different - before the operation my heartbeat was . very weak and I could hardly feel my pulse. Now it’s a very strong . heartbeat. ‘Two years . ago I was cycling nine miles to work and nine miles back every day but . by the time I was admitted to hospital I was struggling to walk even a . few yards. 'I am really . excited about going home and just being able to do the everyday things . that I haven’t been able to do for such a long time - such as playing in . the garden with my son and cooking a meal for my family.’ There . are 214 people waiting for donor hearts in Britain, 15 of whom are . children. Many more are not even put on the transplant list because . their chances of surviving are so slim.","Matthew Green had a completely artificial heart powered by a pump that he had to carry around to keep it beating .

"An illegal immigrant who gave a face to the crime 'total identity theft' has plea guilty for federal prosecutors in a plea deal on charges of stealing the persona of a Houston elementary teacher. Benita Cardona-Gonzalez, 32, pled guilty Monday in a Kansas courthouse to reduced charges of possessing fradulent identification documents. Prosecutors agreed to recommend an 18-month prison term when the Mexican national who resides in Topeka is sentenced in March. Defrauded: Houston school teacher Candida Gutierrez, pictured had her identity stolen several years ago and has been battling with the government since . Gutierrez learned her identity had been hijacked when she was turned down for a mortgage more than a decade ago. Now she trudges to the Social Security Administration with her birth certificate, driver's license, passport  to prove her identity . She has agreed not to contest deportation once her sentence is complete. Booked: Cardona-Gonzale will likely be sentenced to 18 months in prison before being deported for her crimes . Defense attorney Matthew Works told reporters after the hearing that  Cardona-Gonzale was sorry for her actions and didn't wish to hurt Gutierrez. Cardona-Gonzale didn't limit herself to opening fraudulent credit . and bank accounts. She assumed Gutierrez's persona completely, using it . to get a job, a driver's license, a mortgage and even medical care for . the birth of two children. All the while, the crook claimed the . real Gutierrez was the one who had stolen her identity. The women's . kafkaesque nightmare puts a face on 'total identity theft,' a brazen . form of the crime in which con artists go far beyond financial fraud to . assume many other aspects of another person's life. The . scheme has been linked to illegal immigrants who use stolen Social . Security numbers to get paid at their jobs, and authorities fear the . problem could soon grow to ensnare more unsuspecting Americans. 'When she claimed my identity and I claimed it back, she was informed that I was claiming it too,' said Gutierrez, a 31-year-old Houston elementary school teacher. 'She knew I was aware and that I was trying to fight, and yet she would keep fighting. It is not like she realized and she stopped. No, she kept going, and she kept going harder.' Cardona-Gonzalez used Gutierrez's identity during a 10-year period when she worked at a Topeka company that packages refrigerated foods. For years, large numbers of illegal immigrants have filled out payroll forms using their real names but stolen Social Security numbers. However, as electronic employment verification systems such as E-Verify become more common, the use of fake numbers is increasingly difficult. Now prosecutors worry that more people will try to fool the systems by assuming full identities rather than stealing the numbers alone. For victims, total identity theft can also have serious health consequences if electronic medical records linked to Social Security numbers get mixed up, putting at risk the accuracy of important patient information such as blood types or life-threatening allergies. When Gutierrez's identity was stolen, the thief didn't limit herself to opening fraudulent credit and bank accounts. She assumed her persona completely, using it to get a job, a license, a mortgage and even medical care for the birth of two children . Nationwide, employment-related fraud accounted for 8 percent of identity theft complaints last year. But in states with large immigrant populations, employment-related identity fraud was much higher: 25 percent in Arizona, 15 percent in Texas, 16 percent in New Mexico, 12 percent in California. Prosecutors say that the longer a person uses someone else's identity, the more confident the thief becomes using that identity for purposes other than just working. 'It is such a horrible nightmare. You get really angry, and then you start realizing anger is not going to help. But when you have so much on your plate and you keep such a busy life, it is really such a big inconvenience.' Once they have become established in a community, identity thieves don't want to live in the shadows and they seek a normal life like everybody else. That's when they take the next step and get a driver's license, a home loan and health insurance. 'And so that is a natural progression, and that is what we are seeing,' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Brent Anderson, who is prosecuting the case against Gutierrez's alleged impostor. Gutierrez first learned her identity had been hijacked when she was turned down for a mortgage more than a decade ago. Now each year she trudges to the Social Security Administration with her birth certificate, driver's license, passport and even school yearbooks to prove her identity and clear her employment record. She spends hours on the phone with creditors and credit bureaus, fills out affidavits and has yet to clean up her credit history. Her tax records are a mess. She even once phoned the impostor's Kansas employer in a futile effort to find some relief. Both women claimed they were identity theft victims and sought to get new Social Security numbers. The Social Security Administration turned down the request from Gutierrez, instead issuing a new number to the woman impersonating her. Federal Trade Commission statistics show that Americans reported more than 279,000 instances of identity theft in 2011, up from 251,100 a year earlier . And in another ironic twist, Gutierrez was forced to file her federal income tax forms using a special identification number usually reserved for illegal immigrants. 'It is such a horrible nightmare,' Gutierrez said. 'You get really angry, and then you start realizing anger is not going to help. ... But when you have so much on your plate and you keep such a busy life, it is really such a super big inconvenience. You have to find the time for someone who is abusing you.' When Gutierrez recently got married, her husband began researching identity theft on the Internet and stumbled across identity theft cases filed against other illegal immigrants working at Reser's Fine Foods, the same manufacturer where Cardona-Gonzalez worked. He contacted federal authorities in Kansas and asked them to investigate the employee working there who had stolen his wife's identity. The alleged impostor was arrested in August, and her fingerprints confirmed that immigration agents had encountered Cardona-Gonzalez in 1996 in Harlingen, Texas, and sent her back to Mexico.","Candida Gutierrez's identity allegedly stolen by Benita Cardona-Gonzalez .

"Self-service checkouts have the ability to create irrational rage and frustration. But these machines could be about to get a lot smarter – and soon it won’t be just your basket they’re checking out. A patent for a system that can both profile customers while also catching thieves has just been filed by New York-based Symbol Technologies. A patent for a self-service checkout that can both profile customers while also catching thieves has just been filed by New York-based Symbol Technologies . Recent research found that . self-service tills have turned shoppers into thieves with one in five admitting they fail to pay for some items. Shoppers . said the most common reason for failing to pay was simply because they . found it difficult to get the scanners to work properly. Consequently, . rather than spend an age trying to get the scanner to work or hunting . around for a member of staff to help, they just put the item in their . bag. Some 19 per cent of shoppers said they take items every month with a typical value of £15 ($25). If these figures are correct, total losses via these tills runs to a £1.6 billion ($2.7 billion) a year. The group, which helped develop self-scan checkouts for Tesco and Asda, is currently designing 'statistical-based' software for its smart self-scan checkout. The technology can determine whether the shop is in a high-crime area; the time of day; shopping history and queue length, according to a report by Sarah Knapton in the Telegraph. All these factors are plugged into an algorithm that can determine if it is likely a shopper has stolen items. The system will only work if a shopper is identified through a store card. It could also highlight products that are more likely to be stolen, such as batteries and razors, according to the patent. It is unclear how the shop assistants will be alerted to a high-risk shopper, but the group suggests it could help improve random checks 'in areas with a high risk of pilferage’ as well as on new customers.

Some 19 per cent of shoppers said they take items every month with a typical value of £15 ($25), according to recent by VoucherCodesPro.co.uk. Recent research found that self-service tills have turned shoppers into thieves with one in five admitting they fail to pay for some items. Shoppers said the most common reason for failing to pay was simply because they found it difficult to get the scanners to work properly . If these figures are correct, total . losses via these tills runs to a £1.6 billion ($2.7 billion) a . year. A separate study last year found that shoppers are abandoning their purchases in supermarkets as they become increasingly frustrated at being pushed to use self-service tills. One in three of people has walked out of a store because of a bad experience with a self-service till, according to a study. However, many customers disagree and find using the technology difficult, not least because they fear being accused of theft by failing to scan items correctly. Analysts at the retail technology company Tensator said stores seem to be pushing ahead with the self-scan tills because it suits them rather than their customers. In a survey, 84 per cent of respondents admitted to needing staff assistance when using a self-service checkout, while 60 per cent preferred using traditional staffed tills.","Patent for system has been filed by New .

He was last seen on camera on the apartment's driveway at 4.20am before wandering off, according to CTV News. At 4.20 am, the temperature in the area was -2F, and with windchill it felt more like -18F. The boy was found with no vital signs 'tucked away in the corner' in the backyard of a home at 10.20am, Police Inspector Frank Barredo told CBC News. He was discovered by two volunteer searchers just a few hundred yards from where his family thought he was sleeping. He was taken to North York General Hospital in life-threatening condition and later died. There is no indication as to why the boy left his apartment or where he was trying to go, police said.

"She took a nasty tumble just five weeks ago when she was filming The Jump TV ski show for Channel 4, breaking two ribs and having to be flown home from filming early. Now Sally Bercow’s skiing days may be over – at least for a while – after a horrific downhill accident this week that left her with a leg shattered in nine different pieces and saw her winched off the slope by helicopter. The 45-year-old colourful wife of Commons Speaker John Bercow was on a skiing holiday with her three children when she tumbled on a red route at the Austrian alpine resort of Lienz on Tuesday - just a couple of days into her holiday. Scroll down for video . Hospital: A horrific downhill skiing accident has left Sally Bercow with a leg shattered in nine different pieces . Taken away: The Speaker's wife was winched off the slope at the Austrian alpine resort of Lienz by helicopter . Airlifted: The 45-year-old was just a couple of days into her skiing holiday when the accident happened . Up she goes: It was more than ten minutes before a medical evacuation helicopter arrived to winch her away . ‘I don’t really know what happened but I had just switched to racing skis and they are a bit faster than I am used to,' said Mrs Bercow. ‘I knew immediately it was bad. It felt like my leg was hanging off.’ Companions called for help by mobile phone but it was more than ten minutes before a medical evacuation helicopter arrived to winch her off the mountainside. ‘They were very quick but it seemed like an age to me,’ said Mrs Bercow. ‘I was in total agony. As soon as the paramedics arrived I told them to hit me with some morphine. Revealing the damage: Doctors X-rayed her leg and found both bones below the left knee had been broken . Injuries: Mrs Bercow's shin bone had shattered into eight pieces and her fibula had sheared right through . Recovery: Mrs Bercow had been on a skiing holiday with her three children when she tumbled on a red route . 'I don’t really remember much about it after that.’ Couple: House of Commons Speaker John Bercow (left) was alerted immediately and has been monitoring the condition of his wife (right) by phone . Once at the local hospital doctors X-rayed her leg and discovered both bones below the left knee had been broken. Her shin bone had shattered into eight pieces and her fibula had sheared right through. Mrs Bercow said: ‘They told me they were going to operate and insert screws and a metal plate – if they could find one big enough. 'I will probably have it in me for the rest of my life, which will make things fun at airport security. ‘The surgeon told me that if he has done his job properly I should not have a limp and if there’s anywhere you want to break a leg I guess it’s at a ski resort – they are the experts.’ Her husband John, who had not accompanied his family on the half-term ski-break because he was preparing for the General Election campaign, was alerted immediately and has been monitoring his wife’s condition by phone. Mrs Bercow has been told she will be free to leave hospital on Sunday and fly back to Britain but it will be 12 weeks before she is back on her feet properly. In the meantime she is grateful the Speaker’s House is one of the parts of the Palace of Westminster that has disabled access with a lift and a ramp. And there’s one last bright spot. ‘At least I should be able to get out of General Election canvassing for a while,’ joked Mrs Bercow.

"Reading ended their desperate run of poor form in the Championship with a comprehensive 3-0 victory over Rotherham at the Madejski Stadium. Jamie Mackie gave Reading the lead midway through the first half with a precise finish and a second-half brace from top scorer Simon Cox finished off Rotherham, who offered very little all match. Reading manager Nigel Adkins made five changes from the side that lost 3-0 at Blackburn on Saturday, desperate to inject life into a side who had won only once in eight league matches and taken five points from a possible 24. Simon Cox celebrates with  team mate Jamie Mackie after he scores his second and his side's third goal . Reading: Federici, Gunter, Ferdinand (Hector 46), Pearce, Stephen Kelly, Mackie, Norwood, Williams (Akpan 68), Obita, Cox (Taylor 90), Murray. Subs not used: Robson-Kanu, Blackman, Andersen, Cooper. Booked: Akpan,Gunter. Goals: Mackie 29, Cox 55, 64. Rotherham: Collin, Richardson, Morgan, Arnason (Milsom 76), Skarz (Broadfoot 67), Pringle, Green, Frecklington (Bowery 67), Smallwood, Revell, Derbyshire. Subs not used: Loach, Swift, Taylor, Clarke-Harris. Booked: Morgan, Arnason. Attendance: 13,775 . Referee: Pat Miller . Adkins brought in Anton Ferdinand, the former QPR centre-back, for his debut. Ferdinand had not featured, due to a hamstring injury, since signing from Turkish club Antalyaspor on a free transfer during the summer. Ferdinand had little to do in a tame opening to the game, in which neither side were able to muster any clear opportunities. Rotherham, beaten 3-0 at home by Middlesbrough on Saturday, probed constantly but without any serious threat. Reading finally created the first chance when Jordan Obita sped away down the left flank and crossed low into the Rotherham area. However, the onrushing Glenn Murray narrowly failed to make contact with it. Rotherham, unbeaten in five matches prior to losing against Middlesbrough, replied quickly, with Matt Derbyshire testing home goalkeeper Adam Federici with a firm header from a Paul Green cross. Green also drove straight at Federici from 25 yards soon after. Reading soon upped the tempo and went ahead in the 29th minute. Stephen Kelly crossed from the right and Mackie, after a heavy first touch, recovered well to turn smartly and curve a fine shot past Rotherham keeper Adam Collin. It was Mackie's first goal for the club, having signed on a season-long loan from Nottingham Forest during the summer. Cox fires in his second goal as Reading ended their poor run of form . It signalled concerted home pressure up until half-time, with Cox forcing an agile save from Collin with a fierce shot from a Kelly cross. Mackie almost added a second, only to be denied by Collin's flying save, and a powerful Oliver Norwood free-kick from wide out on the left thudded against the Rotherham crossbar with Collin beaten. Reading continued to dominate after the break, with Cox having a shot blocked from close range. Rotherham responded briefly, when Federici saved a direct header from Kari Arnason, but Reading settled the game with two goals in nine minutes. Jamie Mackie celebrates giving Reading the lead in the first half . Mackie ran through the tiring Rotherham defence to set up Cox, who finished precisely past Collin in the 55th minute. Then Mackie again played the provider, in the 64th minute, for Cox to swivel and fire home a clever cross-shot for his seventh goal of the season. Reading ran down the clock thereafter, with Rotherham unable to pose any problems in a poor display.","Jamie Mackie opened the scoring for Reading in the first half .

"Agatha Christie, pictured above, used a Belgian policeman as the inspiration behind her famous detective Hercule Poirot . It is a mystery almost as great as those that he solves. It seems the inspiration behind Agatha Christie's Poirot may have been unveiled as a policeman from Belgium. Little-known gendarme Jacques Hornais is the man who the author turned into her famous detective Hercule, according to the descendant of a wartime fundraiser. Christie introduced the sleuth in her 1920 novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, and he went on to 'exercise his little grey cells' in 33 novels. Although the author never revealed any particular person as her inspiration an amateur researcher says he has now uncovered evidence Hornias could have been the real-life Poirot. New details have emerged of a meeting between a young Hornais and Christie - when she played the piano for him in her home town of Torquay. Hornais fled his country in the face of advancing German troops in 1914,  and made his way to England -  just as the fictional character did. The 57-year-old and his son Lucian, 17, travelled to Exeter, Devon, to meet local volunteer called Alice Graham Clapp, who logs their names in her diary. Mrs Clapp, a married mother-of-four, helped around 500 Belgians find places to stay during the Great War and was later honoured by its Government. She was also involved in wartime fundraising events, hosting one at the home of a friend, a Mrs Potts-Chatto, who was putting up Hornais and his son at her house in Torquay. Newspaper records reveal that locals laid on entertainment on January 6, 1915, with 24-year-old Agatha Christie playing the piano for the Belgian guests. Christie later claimed she 'found' the characters for The Mysterious Affair at Styles while travelling around Torquay. Alice Clapp’s grandson Michael was . researching his relative’s exploits with the help of the Torquay Museum . when he uncovered the chance meeting between Hornais and Christie. 'Jacques Hornais' - now revealed as Jacques Hamoir - fled his country in the face of advancing German troops in 1914,  and made his way to England, just as the fictional character did. The 57-year-old and his son Lucian, 17, travelled to Exeter, Devon, to meet local volunteer called Alice Graham Clapp, who logged their names in her diary . Mr Clapp, a retired Navy Captain, . said: 'Alice kept a black notebook listing some 500 Belgian refugees of . all classes who passed through Exeter. 'The . first lot included this retired gendarme, Jacques Hornais, and his son. The names of many of the families who received them are recorded. 'He eventually went to stay with a Mrs Potts Chatto who lived in a house called the Daisons in Torquay. 'It’s been knocked down now and there’s a housing estate in its place. Christie introduced the sleuth in her 1920 novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, and he went on to 'exercise his little grey cells' in 33 novels . According to her official website, Christie never revealed who inspired the character which in turn became a TV hit - but 'during the First World War there were Belgian refugees in most parts of the English countryside, Torquay being no exception' 'But the Torquay museum has confirmed however that the Potts Chattos held a meeting in their house to raise money and gather clothing for the refugees. 'A young girl played the piano at the event. This young lady later became the crime writer Agatha Christie - so there is a very strong circumstantial link to Poirot.' Mrs Clapp, who was married to Cecil Robert Mainwaring Clapp, a solicitor and Sheriff of Exeter, died in the 1920s just as Christie’s writing career was taking off. For her services to the refugees Mrs Clapp was awarded a Belgian medal, la Medaille de la Reine Elisabeth, which the family still have. Mrs Clapp, a married mother-of-four, helped around 500 Belgians find places to stay during the Great War and was later honoured by its Government . The youngest of the refugees are said to have nicknamed her Moei, pronounced Moy, which is Flemish for Mother. Mr Clapp said his grandmother has personally gone to the train station to meet all 500, including Hornais and his son Lucian, in person. Hornais would have been a similar age to his fictional counterpart, although little else is known about him and there is no mention of whether he had a moustache like Poirot. Mr Clapp said: 'All of us now think of Hercule Poirot as rather a fat chap waddling along with a distinct character but that doesn’t mean to say he was like that in real life. ''All we know about Hornais is that he was gendarme and he had a son. He was married but he didn’t bring along his wife his wife at the time. 'It’s seems quite plausible that Christie met him at the event and may have been intrigued by his stories. 'We don’t know any of this for sure, but then its seems quite fitting that the real life Poirot should remains as mysterious as the books themselves.' According to her official website, Christie never revealed who inspired the character - but 'during the First World War there were Belgian refugees in most parts of the English countryside, Torquay being no exception'. David Brawn, publisher for the Agatha Christie Estate, said: 'Agatha always claimed she was inspired by the Belgian refugees she met. 'It’s quite plausible that she played the piano for them at a social event as she was quite an accomplished pianist. 'As far as I’m aware she never said that Poirot was based on any one person, he’s very much a composite character. 'So whether this event was one of those occasions when she thought about him, I don’t know - but it certainly makes for a great little story.'","It's claimed Jacques Hornais is man who author turned into famous detective .

"Researchers believe that a low dose of the Necator americanus - commonly known as the hookworm - may help relieve symptoms  of MS . Parasitic worms could offer hope to millions suffering from multiple sclerosis, say scientists. Currently there is no cure for the neurological condition, but now researchers believe that a low dose of the Necator americanus - commonly known as the hookworm - may help relieve symptoms. MS sufferers often experience blurred vision, muscle weakness and problems with mobility as the disease attacks the central nervous system. To test the theory, doctors have started recruiting patients for a trial that will see them infected with a harmless dose of the . hookworm. It is thought the presence of the parasite in the body can stop the immune . system from becoming overactive - the main cause of MS - reducing both . the severity of symptoms and the number of relapses. Lead researcher professor . David Pritchard, from . Nottingham University, first noted the health benefits of parasitic worms while in Papua New Guinea during the late 1980s. He observed that patients infected with the hookworm were rarely subject to a range of autoimmune-related illnesses, . including hay fever and asthma. Commenting on the latest study, he said: 'This study appears counter-intuitive - we . are introducing a parasite which is by definition harmful, to act as a . stimulus to moderate disease. 'As a safeguard the hookworms are . being used in carefully controlled and monitored conditions, and if . successful could herald a much-needed therapy for MS patients. 'Currently, there are many MS . patients for whom conventional medicines are ineffective or are . associated with unwanted side effects. 'Hookworms have an innate ability to . moderate the immune system to allow them to survive in the body for . years. This moderation may have a bystander effect on the progression of . MS.' During the trial patients will receive a low dose of the hookworms on a plaster applied to the arm . Prof Pritchard is in the process of . recruiting more than 70 patients from the Nottingham and Derby areas who . suffer from relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) - the most common type in . which vision problems, dizziness and fatigue appear and disappear - and . secondary progressive MS. Half of the patients on the trial will receive a low dose of the hookworms - 25 of the microscopic larvae - on a plaster applied to the arm while the others will receive a placebo. Once the larvae come into contact with . the skin they work their way through into the blood stream until they . reach the lungs where they are coughed up and swallowed to get to their . final destination, the gut, where they survive by latching on to the gut . lining and feeding on the host’s blood. They can  grow up to one centimeter in length as they burrow into blood vessels. The worms do not multiply in the host . but reproduce by producing fertile eggs, which are expelled in human . faeces. These hatch into infective larvae outside the body, which go on . to infect other patients. At the end of the trial, the results . of the two patient groups will be compared to establish whether the . hookworms have been successful in damping down the immune system of the . patients, keeping their symptoms in check and preventing relapses. Multiple sclerosis is the most common neurological condition in young adults in the UK, affecting around 100,000 people. It can occur at any age, but symptoms are mostly first seen between the ages of 20 and 40.","Hookworm thought to relieve symptoms .

Scared campus: Now, San Diego State University (above) wants to test up to 400 students who had contact with the girl . Eerie remark: The teen complained of sick students on her Twitter just two weeks ago . Now, the university is looking to test 300 to 400 people who may have had contact with the young woman, who appears to have spent her weekend doing pledge activities at her new sorority, Kappa Delta. 'This coming weekend might possibly be the best weekend of my life,' she wrote on Twitter early last week. She attended two fraternity parties over the weekend it seems, one at Alpha Epsilon Pion October 8 and one on Octeber 9 at Delta Sigma Phi house. Now, the school is trying to put students at ease. 'This bacteria, it's not easily transmitted, particularly through the air,'said Dr. Gregg Lichtenstein, director of SDSU Student Health Services and director of clinical services. 'This is what we call a droplet infection, so that means people have to have close contact with respiratory secretions.' According to ABC 10, campus wide emails were sent to let students know about the situation, what symptoms to watch for and where to get help. It is believed that Stelzer may have exposed others through close contact from October 5-14. Remembering Sara: 'It doesn't feel real to lose such a vibrant, beautiful person this fast.' one friend wrote of Stelzer's passing . Happy and healthy: Stelzer (seen above with her parents at her high school graduation) had been vaccinated for meningitis . Oddly, on September 29, the teen complained about the number of sick students on campus on her Twitter, writing, 'I would be shocked to meet a freshman at state who doesn't at least have a cold.'

"It was the decade of Dynasty, Dallas, shoulder pads and excess in all forms. Big was beautiful, greed was good, and beauty was bold. Popular television series', films and music reflected the 1980s trend for beautiful people living extraordinary lives. And cult photographer Mario Casilli captured those mesmerising subjects at their best, defining forever the look of 80s pop culture through his soft focus lens. Joan Collins is the cover star of a new book dedicated to 1980s photographer Mario Casilli. She writes in the forword: 'Mario captured absolute glamour' Stars like Joan Collins adored him for making them look fabulous, and his amazing photography is now immortalised in a spectacular coffee table book. Joan, now 80, even wrote the foreword for the tome: 'I . don't think any photographer today has managed to capture a decade in . the way that Mario captured the absolute glamour and decadence in his . 1980s photographs.' As a young photographer working for Paul Hesse at his legendary . Sunset Strip photographic studios, Mario Casilli mixed with the biggest . names in Hollywood. His ease with high profile subjects and beautiful . women would come to define his career. Rebecca Holden in a fuchsia boiler suit and matching blusher with Knight Rider David Hasselhoff in 1983 . Dallas star Morgan Fairchild pictured in 1983 wearing a silver headpiece by Casilli . Between . 1957 and 1981 Casilli became one of the most prolific photographers for . Playboy magazine, shooting no fewer than 57 Playmates, countless other . pictorials and several covers. He even persuaded Barbara Streisand to pose in her underwear. The lensman was given key card #2 to Playboy's legendary chain of clubs; #1 being reserved for the magazine's boss, Hugh Hefner. During the 1980s Casilli began shooting the most high profile TV and music stars in America, capturing the excess, the glamour and decadence of the decade through its most flamboyant household names. The Golden Girls, pretty in pastel. L-R: Estelle Getty, Beatrice Arthur, Betty White, Rue McClanahan in 1985 . Country star Dolly Parton captured in one of her now-iconic outfits in 1987 . Hollywood Wives' Mary Crosby with bouffant hair, a liquid gunmetal dress and soft focus, shot in 1985 . The biggest shows on TV were to . define the decade. Shows making the cover of TV Guide would likely gain 3 . or 4 ratings points so portraits of the stars were big business. Casilli turned them into an art form and his soft focus, high-gloss vision would come to embody the 1980s American dream. From Moonlighting, Miami Vice, Knight Rider and Baywatch to Fresno and The Golden Girls, the master photographer turned his lens to popular culture and redefined it. Casilli's style was also a natural fit for rock and pop stars of the 1980 and the greatest musicians in the world queued up to be his subjects, including Lionel Richie, Dolly Parton and the Bee Gees. Mario passed away in 2001 at the age of 71. Now his work is being published as a collection for the first time by Reel Art Press.

"It may look like a work of art at first glance, but this is the amazing image that reveals the past 170 of hurricanes around the globe. Produced by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, it reveals exactly where in the world is worst hit. The image charts 11,967 tropical cyclones that have occurred on Earth since the NOAA began keeping a record in 1842, when data was supplied by ships and lighthouses rather than today’s advanced satellite detection systems. Interactive map: Using the map on the right hand-side, zoom in on a particular location or zoom out to see a global view. You can then click on the 'Hurricanes' or 'Country Strikes' tabs on the top right to view the frequency and path of all hurricanes in that particular area. The key on the top right corresponds to hurricane strength and the number of hits in that area since 1842. ‘Before the advent of the satellite era, hurricane tracks were constructed from ship reports – and although reliable, some storms were probably missed, the NOAA admits. ‘Geostationary satellites, such as NOAA’s GOES, revolutionised the ability of meteorologists to track cyclones,’ the map-makers explain. ‘Not a single storm is missed as these eyes in the sky provide consistent scans of the globe every few minutes.’ The group has also released an interactive map that allows you to zoom in on specific areas in the world and view hurricanes based on their frequency and path in the area. The team used colours to make patterns in the storms more obvious.

Last month, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration charted the 11,967 tropical cyclones that have occurred on Earth since records began.

Cyclone tracks overlapped the most in the western Pacific and Bay of Bengal. The frequency of track overlaps is much lower in the Western Hemisphere . Cyclone tracks overlapped the most in the western Pacific and Bay of Bengal (India), where typhoon season never ends since waters are always warm enough to sustain cyclone formation. The frequency of track overlaps is much lower in the Western Hemisphere than in the Eastern Hemisphere. They also produced a second map showing storm intensity. In contrast to the first image of frequency, the Northwestern Atlantic shows a much greater spread of strong storms, whereas in the Pacific the strongest cyclones seem to group near the Philippines.

"David Cameron has dubbed Ed Miliband ‘the new Neil Kinnock’ in the wake of the Labour leader’s pledge to bring back 1970s-style energy price freezes. And he mocked Mr Miliband’s 8,000-word speech – made without notes – saying sarcastically: ‘He did well to remember Labour’s entire 1983 Election manifesto.’ The Prime Minister’s private prediction that the next Election, now just 18 months away, will be a re-run of the 1992 contest in which John Major defeated Neil Kinnock, came on the eve of the Tory Party conference in Manchester. Visiting time: David Cameron, the Prime . Minister, and his wife Samantha gear up for the Conservative conference . with a trip to the children's cancer ward at the John Radcliffe Hospital . in Oxford yesterday . Mr Major’s victory came after Labour’s lead in the polls was undermined by claims that their economic policy was too Left-wing and lacked credibility. Mr Miliband’s ‘war on big business,’ as the Prime Minister sees it, has convinced him that he will be able to portray the Labour leader as the new Kinnock. Mr Kinnock led the cheers at the conclusion of Mr Miliband’s Brighton speech last week. The Prime Minister also compared Mr Miliband’s policies with the controversial Election manifesto of Labour’s Michael Foot in 1983. That was dubbed the ‘longest suicide note in history’ and included a vow to scrap Britain’s nuclear weapons. It led to Margaret Thatcher winning a landslide majority of 144 when the country went to the polls in June that year. Leading the cheers: Labour leader Ed Miliband clasps hands with his predecessor Neil Kinnock, who famously lost to John Major's Tories in 1992 despite going into the general election with a healthy lead in the polls . The second longest suicide note in history? The PM mocked Mr Miliband¿s 8,000-word speech to his party conference, saying sarcastically: 'He did well to remember Labour¿s entire 1983 Election manifesto' Mr Cameron made his remarks as he announced plans for some married couples to get tax breaks worth up to £200 a year. A total of four million couples in marriages and civil partnerships, where both parties are basic-rate taxpayers, will benefit from a £1,000 transferable tax allowance from April 2015. Labour critics said that an incentive that worked out at £3.85 a week was unlikely to persuade many  people to tie the knot. Mr Cameron greets the Tory faithful in Manchester: Mr Cameron made his remarks as he announced plans for couples in marriages and civil partnerships who pay basic-rate tax to get breaks worth up to £200 a year . Questions to answer: Mr Cameron was, on the eve of the conference, challenged by a leading Conservative MP to break free from the party¿s 'Stockholm syndrome' of pandering to Left-wing opinion for approval . David Cameron’s pledge of tax breaks for marriage was last night branded ‘social engineering’ by one of his own Tory MPs. The Prime Minister this weekend unveiled a £600million plan to  give millions of couples tax  relief to prove the party believed  in marriage. But embarrassingly for the Prime Minister, the new flagship policy was under open attack from one ‘happily married’ Tory MP within 24 hours of the announcement. In a scathing response, Wycombe MP Steve Baker dismissed the idea as a misuse of the tax system. He said: ‘Fiddling with the tax code to promote a policy of social engineering is not where I would go. I am a big supporter of marriage but I don’t think we should be using the tax system to promote the things that we like.’ Mr Cameron was also challenged by a . leading Conservative MP to break free from the party’s ‘Stockholm . syndrome’ of pandering to Left-wing opinion for approval. Rising star Kwasi Kwarteng  said the Tories should now stop concentrating on ‘detoxifying’ its image and being ‘apologetic’ for  the faults of previous Conservative governments. Rising star: Kwasi . Kwarteng said he was not afraid to back a ‘less intrusive, smaller state’ and mocked colleagues ‘terrified’ of being that labelled that way . Backbench MP Mr Kwarteng, who, like the Prime Minister went to Eton, also admitted he would ‘love’ to get a ministerial job. In an interview for Total Politics magazine, Mr Kwarteng invoked the so-called Stockholm syndrome – in which a hostage takes the side of his captors – to suggest his party was still in hock to Left-wing opinion. He said: ‘For too long . . . we’ve been captured by the Left and we’re apologetic about some of the positions we hold, on things like the economy, or welfare, or immigration. ‘If you believe you’ve lost the battle and you have this sort of Stockholm syndrome, it limits your ability to win big majorities.’ Mr Kwarteng said he was not afraid to back policies for a ‘less intrusive, smaller state’ and mocked Tory colleagues ‘who go nuts’ and were ‘terrified’ of being that labelled that way. He also appeared to suggest that Mr Cameron’s famous project to detoxify his party’s image had run its course. Mr Kwarteng, a leading member of the party’s Free Enterprise Group,  said: ‘The whole notion of detoxification of the Conservative brand, I accept the idea, but people are sick of politicians trying to appear to be things they’re not. ‘Your first question should be, “What is right?” – not “What do I think is going to get me elected?’’ ’ Rapists and knife-wielding thugs will no longer be let off with a warning under tough new laws to be announced this week. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, writing in today’s Mail on Sunday, pledges: ‘There will be no more cautions for rape, for burglary, for possession of a firearm. 'And there will be no more cautions for an adult caught carrying a knife. I want to see those people in court facing charges. ‘If someone out in the town centre is carrying a knife in their pocket with no plausible excuse, a slap on the wrist seems like soft justice in the extreme. Knife crime is a blight on our society.’ More than 500,000 people have been let off with cautions for serious offences in the past 15 years, including more than 400 sex offenders. The out-of-court penalty does not count as a conviction and does not have to be disclosed to employers. They are popular with police as they count towards solved crimes and are quick. Mr Grayling’s move is likely to please delegates at the Tory conference looking for ‘red meat’ law and order policies in the run-up to the next election. More than one in five Tory councillors think David Cameron should form a pact with UKIP at the next election, to avoid splitting the vote and handing victory to Labour. The poll, for BBC Sunday Politics, comes as Nigel Farage prepares to appear at the Tory conference. The UKIP leader, who is barred from inside the secure zone, will address three fringe meetings, one titled ‘Conservative and UKIP: enemies or allies?’, and organised by the Bruges Group, whose previous president was the late Baroness Thatcher. He will speak alongside Tory MP Bill Cash who will argue that UKIP candidates should not run against ‘avowed eurosceptics’ in the 2015 election. The event is expected to be attended by Tory members of the Better Off Out group. There is growing speculation UKIP might agree not to run candidates against such MPs at the next election. Last night, arch-Eurosceptic Tory MP Peter Bone suggested an ‘understanding’ where UKIP did not field candidates against like-minded Tories and in return, Tories gave Ukip a free run in Liberal Democrat-held seats. He added: ‘If we end up replacing Lib Dems with Ukip MPs, then hallelujah!’ But Tory colleague Conor Burns dismissed talk of any pact, saying UKIP was too ‘disparate’ to work with. A UKIP spokesman ruled out a ‘formal deal’, but said local branches had ‘independence’ over the issue.","PM predicts the next election will be re-run of '92 when Major beat Kinnock .

"A man who ordered a sausage biscuit from McDonald's almost bit off more than he would have liked after discovering the snack had already been half-eaten. Don Richardson was on his way to a football game to see Mississippi State play Texas A&M and was about to take a bite out of what he thought was a sausage biscuit when he discovered someone else had beaten him to it. His biscuit was actually an English muffin, buttered and covered in jelly, but worse was the fact someone had already taken several bites taken out of it. Unwanted surprise: Don Richardson ordered a sausage biscuit but what he received was an English muffin, buttered and covered in jelly — with several bites taken out of it . 'I was driving, hurrying  and nearly bit into it before I looked down and saw it,' said Mr Richardson to the Clarion Ledger. 'Marie (his wife) wanted me to take it back, but we were already several miles down the road by then and didn't want to miss kickoff.' Mr Richardson made a number of phone calls to the fast food giant and even went back to the same McDonald's store to tell them about his unwelcome surprise, however so far he has not heard anything from the chain. 'I still haven't gotten as much as a 'We're sorry this happened' or 'We'll check the videotape and see how this happened.' They act like they don't care that I received an order that somebody else — I'm assuming one of their employees — had been eating.' Mr Richardson bought the offending items at the McDonald's at 1806 Spillway Road at the Reservoir in Rankin County as he was on on his way to see Mississippi State play Texas A&M. He says he just wants an apology . McDonald's reported Tuesday its profits dropped 30 percent over the last quarter from a year ago, from $1.52 billion to $1.07 billion. It would appear that after this latest debacle McDonald's has lost at least one more customer. Richardson said he is upset about the situation because he was worried the person who ate the muffin before him may have had some sort of disease. 'I talked with a very nice young lady at the register, but the manager was no help whatsoever,' he said. 'She told me she couldn't replace my order because they were 'now on the lunch menu.' I told her I didn't want it replaced, I wanted an explanation. She then told me if I didn't get out of her line they would call 911. There wasn't even a line to get out of. She was rude and never even offered an 'I'm sorry.' I was astounded.' 'I'm not out to get McDonald's, I'm not out to sue them. But I would like an apology. And I would like for them to care enough to go back and look at the videotape and try to find out how it happened so that it doesn't happen to somebody else. And then call me and tell me what happened. They have my number.'","Don Richards ordered a sausage biscuit but was instead given a McMuffin covered in jelly at a McDonald's in Rankin County, Mississippi .

"A new ‘cyber strike force’ costing up to £500 million is being secretly built by Britain to wage war with a regiment of computer geeks instead of bombs and bullets. Fighter planes, warships and regiments face being replaced by futuristic cyber assaults using lethal computer worms and viruses to wipe out enemy targets. And the Army’s tough fitness tests are to be lowered to allow weedy or overweight ‘computer geniuses’ to join the new front line of ‘keyboard commandoes’. Keyboard commando: Defence Secretary Philip . Hammond in the top-secret bunker beneath the Ministry of Defence, from . where the cyber wars of the future will be fought and won by weedy 'computer geniuses' Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, who will announce the new plans at the Tory conference today, has hailed the changes as the biggest military revolution since tanks replaced cavalry brigades in the First World War a century ago. He told The Mail on Sunday that Britain is the first nation in the world to announce publicly that it has a ‘cyber strike capability’. And he revealed work on developing the ‘laptop army’ is already under way. Future wars would be fought by ‘IT geeks in rooms like this rather than soldiers marching down the streets, or tanks or fighter aircraft’, he said. ‘More and more, modern warfare will be about people sitting in bunkers in front of computer screens, whether remotely piloted aircraft or cyber weapons.’ It is believed Israel, the United States and Iran have already developed such weapons, though no country has admitted to it. Mr Hammond said clinical ‘cyber strikes’ could disable enemy communications, nuclear and chemical weapons, planes, ships and other hardware. And, in contrast with bloody, dangerous and inaccurate bombing raids, entire cities could be conquered without a single loss of life, helping Britain to avoid a military war – and a public relations battle. ‘People think of military as land, sea and air,’ he said. ‘We long ago recognised a fourth domain – space. Now there’s a fifth – cyber. ‘This is the new frontier of defence. For years, we have been building a defensive capability to protect ourselves against these cyber attacks. That is no longer enough. ‘You deter people by having an offensive capability. We will build in Britain a cyber strike capability so we can strike back in cyber space against enemies who attack us, putting cyber alongside land, sea, air and space as a mainstream military activity. Our commanders can use cyber weapons alongside conventional weapons in future conflicts.’ Britain already has a defensive cyber military force to fend off cyber attacks by terrorists and others. It will now develop an attack force in conjunction with GCHQ spy chiefs. Mr Hammond admitted this expansion is already under way. GCHQ Headquarters: The controversial signals intelligence agency is to help develop Hammond's cyber attack force . The significance of the announcement was underlined by his decision to deliver it in an interview with this newspaper conducted in the Ministry of Defence’s vast Pindar nuclear bunker, or ‘Current Contingencies Task Room,’ situated way below Whitehall. It is the first time any Defence Secretary has been photographed or interviewed there. Appropriately for a quantum leap in the Armed Forces, the bunker is crammed with modern technology, including the ability to take over Britain’s entire communications network. More than 100 top politicians, generals and others will live in the bunker, built on the orders of Margaret Thatcher in the Eighties, in the event of nuclear war, a chemical weapons onslaught or other major attack. The Prime Minister is the only person provided with a bunker for his wife and children – so their welfare does not affect his judgment in deciding whether to press the nuclear button. The new face of British special forces: A new . 'Cyber National Guard' will be open to whizzkids who cannot pass Territorial Army . fitness tests. (Stock image) The room is named after Greek lyric poet, Pindar. When Alexander the Great devastated Thebes in 335 BC, he spared the house of Pindar. Mr Hammond says Britain will spend ‘hundreds of millions of pounds’ on the new strike force. The Mail on Sunday understands the figure could be as high as £500 million in the next few years. It will change the appearance of the Army in more ways than one. A new ‘Cyber National Guard’ of part-time reservists will be open to computer whizzkids who cannot pass the current Territorial Army fitness tests, on the basis that press-ups do not aid computer skills. ‘A TA for computer geniuses’, as Mr Hammond called it. He poured scorn on ‘crude and bonkers attacks by armchair generals’ who have criticised him for cutting the number of soldiers – and made it clear conventional forces faced more cuts in the switch. ‘Military capability doesn’t stand still. You cannot fossilise it. ‘As much as we love and cherish our military traditions, the defence of the nation means we must spend money on the capabilities of tomorrow, not yesterday. ‘I’m sure a healthy debate raged 100 years ago about whether to invest in new-fangled tanks and stop buying hay for the horses. Some will have said, “Buy more hay, not tanks.” ‘Those who think they are defending our military capability by defending the shape of the military of last year or the last decade aren’t defending  it at all.’ He spelled out the advantages of cyber warfare: ‘Years ago, you’d go into a target area and bomb it with freefall bombs. Western public opinion increasingly demands precision attack – no civilian casualties, no collateral damage. ‘Cyber weapons provide the tantalising possibility of being able to cripple the enemy without inflicting lasting damage on them. ‘No cities to rebuild, no infrastructure to reconstruct. One of my American counterparts put it to me like this: “Why would you want to bomb someone’s airfield if you could just switch it off with a cyber attack?” ’ It will mean further cuts in soldiers, airmen, sailors, tanks, ships, fighter planes and more – though Mr Hammond refused to say where the axe will fall. ‘We only have one pot of money and if we going to invest hundreds of millions of pounds in cyber capabilities, we have to stop doing something else. ‘That is the tough message. As our cyber capability builds, we will look at how the military would be likely to use it and where that allows us to reduce other capabilities. ‘Where we can tackle a target with cyber weapons, we may need fewer conventional weapons in that area but I can’t say yet where those areas will be. It will be a constant evolution. ‘The trigger of the gun, bomb or missile will always have a role but as the world becomes more dependent on IT systems, one way of delivering incapacitating blow to the enemy will be by delivering a blow to his IT systems.’ Facing further cuts: Hammond admitted that the funds for his cyber army would lead to less for other forces . Unlike soldiers marching in the street, the Armed Forces’ computer geeks would be invisible, but no less effective, said Mr Hammond, clearly worried that the move may be seen as an attempt to conceal cuts in conventional weapons. However, he added: ‘A man with a rifle is not state-of-the-art modern warfare. ‘A modern infantryman has more firepower than an entire platoon in Wellington’s army at Waterloo.’ The cyber strike force was  a further leap forward, he stressed. ‘Looking at nations in terms of how many servicemen and women they have is completely bonkers. ‘It would tell you North Korea is second most powerful nation on earth after China, and the US about number ten.’","Hammond gives interview from MoD's top-secret Pindar nuclear bunker .

"Supermarket chain Morrisons has been forced to apologise for turning the Angel of the North into a giant advert for French stick. The store, which is desperate to claw back customers from budget competitors Lidl and Aldi, used a projector to beam a 175ft-long baguette onto the famous artwork. But the piece of bread, which had a the phrase 'I'm cheaper' beamed on to it to reflect recent price cuts, angered many people, who thought it devalued the artwork. 'Defiled': Morrisons has apologised for projected a 175ft baguette onto the Angel of the North in Gateshead, Tyneside . The response to the stunt - which was set up without permission - was led by sculptor Anthony Gormley, who designed the huge, steel statue, which has stood in by the A1 in Gateshead, Tyneside, since 1998. He told the Guardian: 'I'd rather the Angel is not used for such purposes, but it's out there'. Meanwhile, hundreds of social media users who had seen an image posted by Morrisons on Saturday evening, formed a chorus of disapproval. One tweeted that the supermarket had 'defiled' the angel, while others described the move as 'philistine and disgraceful'. Many threatened to boycott the supermarket as a response. Gateshead . council, which maintains the sculpture, said that it was 'disappointed' by the advert, which did not follow its usual procedures for product . placement. Original: The Angel of the North has stood next to the A1 since 1998 . Permission: Gateshead council has said it was 'disappointed' that the stunt took place . A spokesman said: 'Many goods and services have and want to be profiled alongside it, and there is a filming process in place to work with organisations to do this, although this does not include lighting the Angel in any way. 'It is disappointing this process does not appear to have been followed.' In light of the backlash from the gimmick, Morrisons apologised for the tactic, which it hoped would be 'something different'. He said: 'We’re sorry if people thought we got carried away by shining a baguette on the Angel of the North and apologise unreservedly to those to whom we have caused offence. 'We were trying something different which was meant to put a smile on people’s faces but clearly it wasn’t to everybody’s tastes. 'We’re so proud of our northern roots and the last thing we want to do is offend anybody.' When it is not being commandeered to advertise baguettes, the Angel of the North is celebrated as one of Britain's best-known pieces of public art. The sculpture, designed by Anthony Gormley, stands not far from the A1 in Gateshead, Tyneside. It was built between 1994 and 1998. At 175ft wide, its wingspan exceeds that of a Boeing 757. The steel statue weighs 208 tonnes and is 65ft high. Its structure is so stable that it only needs to be inspected once every seven years. The statue - which Gateshead council claims is the largest representation of an angel in the world - stands on top of a disused mine. Mr Gormley said that its location helped evoke the region's industrial past, commemorating the hard work and struggles of two centuries of miners, but that it was also meant to mark Britain's transition into the future.","Supermarket chain projected 175ft baguette onto the public artwork .

Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha talk to Scarlett Clarkson (left) during a visit to the children's cancer ward at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford . The PM met with Chase Howie (right) who could benefit from the fund along with thousands of other sufferers . The fund was set up for patients in England after . shocking stories of patients being refused life-saving drugs by the National . Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) because they were too expensive . or unproven. It meant that wealthy people with cancer were able to . receive the drugs by laying for it themselves but less well-off patients were . barred. Mr Cameron said the fund, which has already been used by . 35,000 patients, was saving lives. Speaking after meeting cancer patients young and old at . The John Radcliffe Hospital, in Oxford, the PM said: ’People have lived longer . and in some cases it has saved people's lives. ’I just met one man from Hampshire who wouldn't be here . were it not for the Cancer Drugs Fund and the treatments that he got. He is now . cancer free.’ The scheme was set to run until 2014 and campaigners . raised concerns about where patients will turn to when the funding ceased. But Mr Cameron said that the funding programme will run . for an extra two years to March 2016. While praised cancer charities, some doctors have raised . concerns about the fund. The medical journal The Lancet called the fund ’the . product of political opportunism and intellectual incoherence’. David Cameron and his wife met with patients who said they would not be alive if it weren't for the fund . As many as 35,000 patients could benefit as a result of extra funding announced by the PM . The Rarer Cancers Foundation campaigned for the fund's extension and welcomed the move . Mr Cameron insisted: ’Thousands of people have already . been helped and this will mean many more people can access it in the years to . come.’ Mr Cameron and his wife Samantha were taken around the . children's cancer ward by senior clinical staff where they met youngsters of . all ages being treated for the disease. Later he met people who were in remission from cancer and . talked with them about their experiences on the NHS. The Rarer Cancers Foundation, which campaigned for the . fund to be extended, welcomed the announcement of the fund's extension. Andrew Wilson, chief executive of the charity, said: ’The . Cancer Drugs Fund has made a huge difference to cancer patients in England, . significantly improving the quality of treatment available to people with . advanced forms of cancer. ’It has also addressed some of the historic inequities . that have existed for people with rarer cancers, ensuring that access to . treatment is not denied simply because you are unlucky enough to have a rare . form of cancer.’ Not everyone is pleased with the fund and with one journal calling it 'the product of political opportunism and intellectual incoherence' So far about 35,000 patients have benefited from the fund . and the charity estimates that 16,500 extra patients will benefit each year as . a result of the extension of the funding programme. Dr Andrew Protheroe, consultant in medical oncology at . The Churchill Hospital in Oxford, added: ’The more treatment options that are . available to me, the better job I feel I can do for my patients. ’There is nothing more frustrating than knowing there is . an effective, licensed, evidence-based treatment available which I am not . allowed to use. ’It is like trying to do your job with one hand tied . behind your back. ’Before the Cancer Drugs Fund, doctors were not able to . use a whole range of drugs which were part of standard practice in other . countries.’ Dr Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, . said: ’New treatments targeting the genetic changes in cancer are being . developed all the time, and the Cancer Drugs Fund is a vital way for patients . to get them as soon as they've been properly tested and shown to work.’ Alongside plans to extend the fund, Mr Cameron also . announced that Genomics England - a Government-owned organisation tasked with . mapping the DNA of 100,000 patients with cancer and rare diseases - will begin . a partnership with Cancer Research UK. But Labour’s shadow health minister Liz Kendall said: . ’The reality is that David Cameron is letting down cancer patients. ’A recent report for Cancer Research UK found NHS staff . were worried that the Government's NHS reorganisation was fragmenting cancer . services and stalling the dramatic improvements in cancer treatment seen over . the last decade.’","Drugs fund set up after patients being refused treatment on .

"Nazi concentration camp bosses, such as Adolf Eichmann, who claimed they were just 'following orders' truly believed in what they were doing, researchers have claimed . Nazi concentration camp bosses who claimed they were just 'following orders' truly believed and took pride in what they were doing, researchers have claimed. Landmark studies on human behaviour in the 1960s and 1970s had founded the theory that people carried out evil act because they naturally follow orders from figures of authority. And Nazi war criminals  famously tried the defence at the Nuremberg trials. But Scottish psychologists have challenged the fifty-year-old findings after going back and re-examining the original experiments. Professor Stephen Reicher of the University of St Andrews and Prof Alex Haslam of the University of Queensland, Australia, began their research ten years ago with a prison study which was broadcast on the BBC. They found that volunteers given the role of 'guards' only acted brutally when they identified with their role and believed their actions were necessary to maintain control. In a series of more recent experiments, they found that people will only bow to authority if they believe it is necessary to serve a greater good. Professor Haslam said: 'Our own . research shows that tyranny does not result from blind conformity to . rules and roles, it is a creative act of followership that flows from . identification with authorities who represent vicious acts as virtuous.' The researchers both add: 'A series . of thoroughgoing historical examinations have challenged the idea that . Nazi bureaucrats were ever simply following orders. 'This may have been the defence they . relied upon when seeking to minimize their culpability, but evidence . suggests that functionaries like Eichmann (hanged in 1962 for his role . in organising the Holocaust) had a very good understanding of what they . were doing and took pride in the energy and application that they . brought to their work. Nazi war criminals tried the defence that they were 'following orders'.  Pictured are concentration camp prisoners as US troops liberate the Nazi concentration camp in Dachau, Germany, 30 April 1945 . In Stanley Milgram’s research on obedience to . authority, carried out in the 1960s and 1970s, volunteers found themselves cast in the role of a 'teacher' with the task of administering shocks of increasing magnitude to another man - the learner - every time he failed to recall a correct word. Unbeknown to the 'teacher', the 'learner' was an actor, and the shocks were not real. But to Milgram’s and everyone else’s dismay, all participants proved willing to administer shocks of 300 volts and 65 per cent went all the way to 450 volts. This appeared to provide compelling evidence that normal well-adjusted men would be willing to kill a complete stranger simply because they were ordered to do so by an authority figure. Zimbardo’s Stanford Prison Experiment took these ideas further by exploring the destructive behaviour of groups of men over an extended period. Students were randomly assigned to be either guards or prisoners within a mock prison that had been constructed in the Stanford Psychology Department. In contrast to Milgram’s studies, the objective was to observe the interaction within and between the two groups in the absence of an obviously malevolent authority. Once again, the results proved shocking - and the abuse handed out to the prisoners by the guards was so brutal that the study had to be terminated after just six days. 'Typically too, roles and orders were . vague, and hence for those who wanted to advance the Nazi cause - and . not all did - creativity and imagination were required in order to work . towards the regime’s assumed goals and to overcome the challenges . associated with any given task.' 'Emblematic of this, the practical . details of ‘the final solution’ were not handed down from on high, but . had to be elaborated by Eichmann himself. ' Today's understanding of the psychology of tyranny is dominated by two classic . studies from the 60s and 70s: Stanley Milgram’s research on obedience to . authority and Philip Zimbardo’s Stanford Prison Experiment, which found people tended to simply follow orders. But the new study of these findings, headed by Professor Reicher suggests zealousness is the key to such acts of violence. Reicher and Haslam say that there is a 'believed morality' behind people’s actions. Professor Reicher said: 'In short, . people do harm not because they are unaware that they are doing wrong, . but because they believe that they are doing right. 'The fundamental point is that tyranny does not flourish because perpetrators are helpless and ignorant of their actions. 'It flourishes because they actively identify with those who promote vicious acts as virtuous. 'It is this conviction that steels . participants to do their dirty work and that makes them work . energetically and creatively to ensure its success. 'Moreover, this work is something for . which they actively wish to be held accountable - so long as it secures . the approbation of those in power.'","People do not just carry out evil acts because they naturally follow orders, say experts .
Scottish psychologists instead found they must 'believe in what they are doing'"

"With its formidable 5ft fences, the Hickstead Derby is a challenge for any horse. So for 14-year-old Addy, who had his right eye removed after an infection, the event looked like an insurmountable task. But the showjumper didn’t bat an eyelid – and became the first one-eyed horse in the derby’s 54-year history to win the coveted trophy. The one-eyed winner of the Hickstead Derby, Adventure de Kannan (known as Addy ) with rider , Trevor Breen's daughter, Mia ( 20 months) Addy – full name Adventure de Kannan – had his eye removed last year, following six years of painful ulcers. Since then, he hasn’t looked back. ‘If anything, it’s made him better,’ said his rider Trevor Breen. ‘He’s got a great attitude and a big heart... which is why I think he has been able to overcome adversity so well. Whatever you ask him to do, he gives everything.’ Taking everything in his stride, Addy is rarely spooked by people approaching on his blind side, and has honed his hearing to compensate. Cheered by a 15,000-strong crowd, the fiercely determined bay gelding overcame what many believed would be an insurmountable handicap to be garlanded as the first one-eyed champion in the event’s 54-year history. Yesterday, strutting around a paddock and chomping carrots at home on a Buckinghamshire farm, you could hardly blame him for resting on his laurels a little. (Especially as he shares it with a one-eyed dog, and, until recently, the family’s one-eyed goldfish, RIP). But as triumphant rider Mr Breen and his 26-year-old wife Caroline explained, the equestrian one-eyed wonder can still see a bright future ahead of him in what has turned out to be a remarkable showjumping career. The story of Addy began when Trevor, a championship rider and leading equestrian figure, borrowed the horse from owner Karen Swann, then a neighbour in his native Ireland. ‘I liked him straight away,’ he told me yesterday. ‘So basically I never gave him back. We kind of struck up a relationship. He’s got a great attitude and a big heart… which is why I think he has been able to overcome adversity so well. Whatever you ask him to do, he gives everything.’ Addy had his eye removed last year, following six years of painful ulcers. Cheered by a 15,000-strong crowd, the fiercely determined bay gelding overcame what many believed would be an insurmountable handicap to be garlanded as the first one-eyed champion in the event's 54-year history . Addy’s eye condition was first noticed when he was eight. Despite being able to compete in major events, he needed constant monitoring by vets and years of treatment. Instead of looking forward to a pat and a Polo when someone came into the stable, he would usually have to undergo some sort of treatment or medication. Being such an obliging horse, however, Addy would tip is head to one side to make it easier to apply eye drops. Then, to the distress of everyone around him, things changed. ‘Addy effectively told me it was over,’ said Trevor, 35. ‘Instead of tilting his head, it took two grooms to hold him just to get the drops in. He was obviously in pain and we didn’t know how much, or for how long he’d been putting up with it. Last year the infected right eye was removed by a specialist surgeon, leaving only the socket. No-one knew then what effect it would have on Addy or on his showjumping career. Because of the position of eyes on a horse’s head, they do not have peripheral vision anyway. So to approach and jump fences with only one eye would be an enormous feat. Except, that is, if you’re a trooper like Addy, a giant at 17.1 hands tall and a horse that doesn’t like to say no. Trevor Breen celebrates with his wife Caroline and Adventure De Kannan after winning the Hickstead Derby . 'He changed instantly,’ said Trevor. ‘It was like we’d wound the clock back three years. His character came back… he got a little bit cheeky… we had almost forgotten how he was before. It was the best decision we ever made.’ And his performance? ‘If anything, it’s made him better,’ said Trevor. ‘I think I started off by riding him a little bit differently and over-compensating for him. In the end I just rode normally and let him get on with it. It seems to have worked.’ Perhaps surprisingly, he is rarely spooked by people approaching on his blind side. Addy resides at the family farm and equestrian business in Gerrards Cross along with a stable of other sporting horses. Since the operation he has become a firm friend of Caroline and Trevor’s 20-month-old daughter Mia, keeping perfectly still to enable her to sit on his back. Soon, however, there will be work to do - his competition calendar is full for the next several months. And of course, he has a keen eye on some more trophies.","Addy – full name Adventure de Kannan – had his eye removed last year .

"It is named after the Celtic god of thunder, can fly faster than the speed of sound and evades enemy radar with its single-wing stealth design. This is Taranis, Britain’s latest pilotless combat aircraft, which is even capable of selecting its own targets. The revolutionary superdrone is due to make its maiden flight in the next few weeks and could spearhead the fight against  terrorism in Africa. Taranis (graphic pictured) is named after the Celtic god of thunder and designed to fly faster than the speed of sound and evade enemy radar with its single-wing stealth design. During tests, Taranis also used latest stealth communications systems to stay in touch with its commander without revealing its position . Military chiefs believe Taranis’s ground-breaking technology will allow a powerful new generation of drones equipped with deadly payloads to fly from British bases to attack targets worldwide. But the new developments in pilotless aircraft are controversial as they allow the possibility of autonomous computers  targeting and killing enemy combatants outside human  control. Experts even warned last night that the new technology raised the nightmare spectre of out-of-control robots waging war on humans – and called for a global ban on autonomous technology. Britain’s armed drones are currently piloted remotely by aircrews on the ground. But Taranis will follow a set flightpath using on-board computers to perform manoeuvres, avoid threats and identify targets. Only when it needs to attack a target will it seek authorisation from a human controller. Professor Noel Sharkey, a robotics engineer specialising in autonomous military systems at Sheffield University, said last night:  ‘This is a very dangerous move. Once it has been developed, who knows what new governments who inherit the technology will do with it.’ Last week, Prime Minister David Cameron warned that the fight against terrorism in North Africa could last decades, meaning futuristic drones could dominate counter-terrorism strategy in the region. Military technology: A US Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone  takes off from Kandahar Air Base, Afghanistan. A proliferation in mainly US military technology has sparked a drone arms race . The controversy surrounding their use was highlighted last week when the United Nations launched an investigation into the deaths caused by conventional drone attacks. British Forces currently operate armed drones only in Afghanistan, where they target Taliban insurgents. However, a proliferation in mainly US military technology has sparked a drone arms race. To compete, the UK Government has committed itself to a new generation of pilotless aircraft which can fly distances of more than  2,000 miles. A defence source said that Taranis’s long-anticipated maiden test flight has been delayed by technological setbacks as well as UK aviation safety laws which restrict the flight of drones in this country. But the source added that the aircraft, which weighs eight tons and is about the size of an RAF Hawk jet, will make its first flight in Australia in the next few weeks, where its progress will be closely monitored by  Ministry of Defence chiefs. Prof Sharkey said: ‘Taranis is a concept prototype – so it is really the beta version of an intercontinental attack plane. With the proliferation of pilotless combat aircraft that is certainly going to happen, it wasn’t going to be long before the person was taken out of the loop. Competition: A US K-MAX pilotless freight helicopter in Helmand province in Afghanistan. To compete, the UK Government has committed itself to a new generation of pilotless aircraft . ‘It would be very difficult for a human to keep control of teams of these moving at such speed. It could put ours at a disadvantage to others that did not have a human supervisor. This is why we need a global ban on autonomous drones before proliferation begins in earnest.’ But the MoD says the programme is designed so that a human will make the final decision on the firing of weapons and that as a ‘demonstrator’ it was far too early to say what role Taranis would have in future combat missions. The superdrone, manufactured by BAE, is the product of a 2006 MoD decision to develop and fly an uncrewed aircraft that goes one better than current US systems by using a customised Rolls-Royce jet engine rather than a propeller. When its sleek design was first unveiled in 2010 at an  airfield in Warton, Lancashire, it was accompanied by boasts from its designers that Taranis could strike at the heart of  Britain’s enemies without risking British lives. BAE chiefs said Taranis would be an ‘autonomous stealthy Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle [UCAV] ultimately capable of precisely striking targets at long range, even in another continent’. An MoD spokesman said: ‘Taranis is a trailblazing project that reflects the very best of our nation’s advanced design and technology skills and is  a leading programme on the global stage. ‘Unmanned Air Vehicles play an important role in operations, helping reduce the risks faced by military personnel on the front line. ‘Forthcoming Taranis trials will provide further information about the potential capabilities of Unmanned Combat Air Systems.’ A spokesman for BAE said: ‘Taranis is a joint BAE-MoD programme and we are not at liberty to confirm any details of the forthcoming flight, including the location, timing or who may be present.’","Revolutionary superdrone could spearhead fight against terrorism in Africa .

"Human traffickers are forcing illegal immigrant children to cut off the ears and fingers of other kids traveling into the U.S. in order to extort money from their families, a Texas senator claimed on Monday. Lashing out at President Barack Obama for a 2012 policy shift that he said encourages Central American parents to send their children northward, Sen. Ted Cruz said the children are being placed in 'unspeakable' peril when the traffickers,known as 'coyotes,' take over. 'We just heard stories . of little boys and little girls, forced by these drug dealers to cut . off the fingers or cut off the ears of other little boys and little . girls, in order to extort money from their families,' Cruz said after he toured the temporary holding facility for 'unaccompanied alien children' at Lackland Air Force Base along with Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott and Rep. Michael Burgess. 'And these children . are told, ""If you don't cut off the fingers or ears of another child, . you'll be shot"".' Cruz was relating accounts he heard from officials at the Lackland facility in San Antonio, according to a spokesperson in his office. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sen. Ted Cruz, right, with Attorney General and Republican gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbott, talked to reporters on Monday outside a temporary shelter for unaccompanied illegal immigrant children at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas . Heartbreak: More than 1,000 children -- a tiny fraction of the national total this year -- wait at Lackland AFB while health care professionals and caseworkers figure out how to reunite them with family members -- who may not be in the U.S. legally themselves . The coyotes, Cruz said, 'are not well-meaning . social workers trying to care for these kids. These are hardened, cold . criminals. These are transnational, global criminal cartels. And they . are vicious, violent murderers.' 'These children are being subjected to . physical abuse, to sexual abuse. Some of them are losing their lives.' 'When the President of the United States . prevents the Border Patrol from following the law and enforcing our . immigration laws,' Cruz declared, 'when the President of the United States announces to . the world, ""Amnesty for those who have broken the law,"" the consequence is . that people respond to that.' 'And the way they've responded to that is . handing over their children to drug dealers and vicious cartels.' Abbott, who is running to succeed Republican Rick Perry as governor of Texas, confirmed the accounts they heard and agreed that the White House deserves the blame. 'We are dealing with a human-made crisis. The . challenges  these children are going through are unprecedented,' he said, 'and it . is unacceptable to have children housed in facilities like this.' 'Equally . unacceptable, though, is to have a president promoting policies that . entice children to navigate more than 1,000 miles away from home, going . through the most treacherous conditions, facing things like human . trafficking and sexual assault.' 'We were told of remarkable stories, . stories about children having their ears cut off, of having fingers cut . off in the pathway, on the way here. A story about a quadriplegic child . who was left on the banks of the Rio Grande River on the United States . side, showing the way that these cartels and gangs and smugglers . operate.' Both men pegged Obama's 2012 policy shift – his Rose garden announcement of a 'deferred action' program to stop the deportation of people brought into the country as minors before June 2007 – sa the starting gun for the flood of children across America's southern border. 'We are witnessing a humanitarian crisis unfolding that is a direct consequence of President Obama's lawlessness,' Cruz said. 'Obama . lawlessly granted amnesty to some 800,000 people here illegally who . entered as children. And the direct consequence of that lawlessness, of . that amnesty, is that we have seen the number of children taking the . incredible risks that are entailed with coming across the border grow . exponentially.' 'It has gone from 6,000 in 2011,' he said, 'to this year – it is . expected to be 90,000 .... next year the estimates are 145,000.' Unspeakable horror: The lawmakers heard about sexual and physical assaults, including some cases where children were threatened with death if they refused to cut of other kids' body parts to use as extortion bait with their parents . Abbott has ordered Texas law enforcement officers to plug the holes that he says Obama has left in U.S. border security as Border Patrol agents are transformed into glorified day care workers. And he's demanding that the Department of Homeland Security cough up the funds needed to pay them. 'While we have border control agents who . are spending time taking care of the health care needs of these . children, border control agents who are literally changing diapers and . making baby formula,' Abbott told reporters, 'at that time we have the cartels who are engaging . in their international trafficking operations, cartels who are importing . crime into the United States, importing into the United States some of . the most dangerous gang members around the globe.' Drug cartels taking advantage of the diversion of federal law enforcement personnel, he claimed, 'may be making well over $100 million because of this operation.' 'The state of Texas is going to put the boots on the ground,' Abbot said, 'but we expect the federal government to foot the bill.' 'We are demanding that the federal government pay for the operations by the Texas Department of Public Safety to keep this state safe.' Cruz shot back against the administration's claim that regional violence, and not the president's policies, are to blame for the avalanche of young people pouring into Texas, New Mexico and Arizona. 'That is an explanation that makes no sense,' Cruz said. More help coming: Texas has put its own public safety personnel on the border, working alongside U.S. Border Patrol agents and guided by National Guard troops in Lakota helicopters, in order to find illegal immigrants crossing into the US . 'Violence in Central America explains the increase in immigrants from those countries, but there's no reason why violence in Central America would cause more parents to send their kids alone.' 'You would expect to see more families coming to flee violence,' he said. 'We've always seen that: Whenever a region of the world is suffering under significant violence, we've always seen an increase in immigration from those areas. But the shift here is dramatic. The shift here in particular focuses on unaccompanied minors. And the reason it does is not difficult to ascertain.' Parents in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, he insisted, 'have been led to believe that all their child has to do is get to America and they will receive amnesty.' 'And as long as they believe that, we will see thousands upon thousands more little boys and little girls physically violated, sexually violated, subjected to unspeakable horrors.' In 2013 the U.S. Border Patrol recorded 2,346 rescues, 461 assaults, and 445 deaths along the border, mostly crimes in which illegal immigrants were the victims.","Sen.

"Cyber criminals can make ten times more money hacking someone's medical information rather than their credit card details, new research has shown. The FBI has warned US health care providers of the new threat after a group of Chinese hackers stole personal information from 4.5 million patients after targeting the computer network of Community Health Systems Inc. Internet security experts believe the $3 trillion US healthcare industry is a ripe target for cyber criminals because many health care providers use older computers with inadequate tools to protect the confidential information. Scroll down for video . Dave Kennedy, CEO of TrustedSEC said hospitals have low security so it is easy for hackers to get lots of data . Cyber criminals have discovered that stolen healthcare details are ten times more valuable than credit cards . Dave Kennedy, healthcare security expert and chief executive officer of TrustedSEC warned that too many providers underestimate the scale of the problem. He said: 'As attackers discover new methods to make money, the healthcare industry is becoming a much riper target because of the ability to sell large batches of personal data for profit. 'Hospitals have low security, so it's relatively easy for these hackers to get a large amount of personal data for medical fraud.' Interviews with nearly a dozen healthcare executives, cybersecurity investigators and fraud experts provide a detailed account of the underground market for stolen patient data. The data for sale includes names, birth dates, policy numbers, diagnosis codes and billing information. Fraudsters use this data to create fake IDs to buy medical equipment or drugs that can be resold, or they combine a patient number with a false provider number and file made-up claims with insurers, according to experts who have investigated cyber attacks on healthcare organizations. Medical identity theft is often not immediately identified by a patient or their provider, giving criminals years to milk such credentials. That makes medical data more valuable than credit cards, which tend to be quickly canceled by banks once fraud is detected. Stolen health credentials can go for $10 each, about 10 or 20 times the value of a US credit card number, according to Don Jackson, director of threat intelligence at PhishLabs, a cyber crime protection company. He obtained the data by monitoring underground exchanges where hackers sell the information. The percentage of healthcare organizations that have reported a criminal cyber attack has risen to 40 per cent in 2013 from 20 per cent in 2009, according to an annual survey by the Ponemon Institute think tank on data protection policy. The hacker access medical records and use the details to make fraudulent claims against insurance policies . Founder Larry Ponemon, who is privy to details of attacks on healthcare firms that have not been made public, said he has seen an increase this year in both the number of cyber attacks and number of records stolen in those breaches. Fueling that increase is a shift to electronic medical records by a majority of US healthcare providers. Marc Probst, chief information officer of Intermountain Healthcare in Salt Lake City, said his hospital system fends off thousands of attempts to penetrate its network each week. So far it is not aware of a successful attack. He said: 'The only reason to buy that data is so they can fraudulently bill.' Healthcare providers and insurers must publicly disclose data breaches affecting more than 500 people, but there are no laws requiring criminal prosecution. As a result, the total cost of cyber attacks on the healthcare system is difficult to pin down. Insurance industry experts say they are one of many expenses ultimately passed onto Americans as part of rising health insurance premiums. Consumers sometimes discover their credentials have been stolen only after fraudsters use their personal medical ID to impersonate them and obtain health services. When the unpaid bills are sent on to debt collectors, they track down the fraud victims and seek payment. Ponemon cited a case last year in which one patient learned that his records at a major hospital chain were compromised after he started receiving bills related to a heart procedure he had not undergone. The man's credentials were also used to buy a mobility scooter and several pieces of medical equipment, racking up tens of thousands of dollars in total fraud. The government's efforts to combat Medicare fraud have focused on traditional types of scams that involve provider billing and over billing. Fraud involving the Medicare program for seniors and the disabled totaled more than $6 billion in the last two years, according to a database maintained by Medical Identity Fraud Alliance. Jeff Horne, vice president at cyber security firm Accuvant said: 'Healthcare providers and hospitals are just some of the easiest networks to break into. 'When I've looked at hospitals, and when I've talked to other people inside of a breach, they are using very old legacy systems - Windows systems that are 10 plus years old that have not seen a patch.' KPMG partner Michael Ebert said security has been an afterthought for many medical providers - whether it is building encryption into software used to create electronic patient records or in setting budgets. He said: 'Are you going to put money into a brand new MRI machine or laser surgery or are you going to put money into a new firewall?'","Hospitals and health care providers are 'easy targets' according to experts .

"More than a dozen CIA spies have reportedly been caught in Iran and Lebanon and the U.S. government now fears they have been executed. The spies were paid informants who were targeting Iran - which is feared to be producing nuclear weapons - and the Hezbollah group in Beirut. Their discovery is a big hindrance to U.S. attempts to track Iran’s nuclear activities and discover if Hezbollah is plotting any attacks against Israel. Past explosions: In 1983 more than 300 people - including 260 Americans - were killed in an attack on the U.S. embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut . ‘Espionage is a risky business,’ a . U.S. official told ABC News. ‘Many risks lead to wins but some result in . occasional setbacks.’ Former . senior CIA officer Robert Baer worked against Hezbollah in the 1980s . and said the group will often execute those it believes to be spies. ‘If they were genuine spies, spying against Hezbollah, I don't think we'll ever see them again,’ Mr Baer told ABC News. Other officials pointed out Hezbollah killed more Americans than any other terrorist organisation before the 9/11 attacks. In 1983 more than 300 people - including 260 Americans - were killed in an attack on the U.S. embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut. Spying: The discovery damages U.S. attempts to track the activities of Iran and its president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, right, and Hezbollah's Sheik Hassan Nasrallah . Some officials speaking to ABC News . credited Iran and Hezbollah with their detection of spies, but others . blamed sloppy CIA operations. Hezbollah and Iran are among the CIA's toughest adversaries and have been improving their ability to hunt spies by relying on patience and guile to exploit holes. The number of CIA agents in Iran and Lebanon countries is classified - but Iran claimed in May it arrested at least 30 people allegedly linked to a CIA-run spy network. Hezbollah - backed by Iran - has built a professional counter-intelligence operation they proudly describe as the 'spy combat unit'. But the U.S. has had no diplomatic presence in Iran for 30 years and this makes the CIA's job of finding out what is happening on the ground all the more important. One case came when two Hezbollah agents pretended to work for the U.S. and the group found out where CIA officers were meeting with agents. Two former officials told ABC News the CIA used the code-word ‘Pizza’ and the location was a Beirut Pizza Hut - but a current official denied this. Hezbollah's longtime leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah boasted in June he had rooted out at least two CIA spies who had infiltrated his group’s ranks. The damage to the Lebanon spy network has been greater than usual and the crisis is the latest mishap involving CIA counterintelligence. Two years ago a suicide bomber posed as an informant and killed seven CIA employees and wounded six others in Afghanistan in December 2009. 'It all depends on who these guys were and what they have to say. Hezbollah has disappeared people before. Others they have kept around' Matthew Levitt . The U.S. State Department last year described Hezbollah as ‘the most technically capable terrorist group in the world’.

"Hair dyes used by millions of women contain chemicals linked to cancer, British scientists have warned. They say that both home hair colouring kits and the dyes used at expensive salons pose a potential risk to health. Writing in a respected scientific journal, they say chemicals in permanent hair dyes can react with tobacco smoke and other pollutants in the air to form one of the most powerful cancer-causing compounds known to man. High risk beauty: The hair dye chemicals could react with tobacco smoke and exhaust fumes, to form highly poisonous chemicals called N-nitrosamines . With more than a third of women and one in ten men regularly colouring their hair, the researchers say it is ‘imperative’ that the risk to health is quantified. However, the cosmetics industry has strongly disputed the claim. The warning comes from scientists at Leeds-based company Green Chemicals who conducted a review of the chemistry surrounding hair dye. They said that all the information was already available and they simply ‘joined the dots’ to make the link with cancer. They warn that chemicals called secondary amines, which are either found in all permanent hair dyes or are formed in them, can penetrate the skin and stay on the hair for weeks, months or even years after the dye is applied. Over time, they could react with tobacco smoke and exhaust fumes, to form highly poisonous chemicals called N-nitrosamines. Unsafe: Even dyes used at expensive salons can contain the dangerous chemicals . Known to cause cancer, these are banned from use in cosmetics. But the Leeds researchers argue that they can still be generated via a simple chemical reaction. Hair dye has previously been linked to a range of cancers, including tumours of the breast, bladder, ovaries and brain and leukaemia. There are also concerns that increasing numbers of people are becoming allergic to their contents, sometimes with fatal results. The sale of home hair dye kits alone is worth an estimated £321million a year and the figure is expected to rise as the population ages. Professor David Lewis, one of the authors of the study, and an expert in the chemistry of various dyes, said: ‘At this stage, we can’t be sure of the amount of N-nitrosamines produced or the level of risk these compounds pose but it is clear a potential hazard exists. ‘In the interest of consumer safety, it is imperative that a thorough and independent investigation is conducted to establish the levels of toxicity of these compounds and the potential risks.’ A spokesman for Green Chemicals, which is about to launch its own ‘ultra-safe’ range of hair dyes, said that despite numerous studies of the subject the danger posed by the chemicals in hair dye reacting with the air has been missed or ignored until now. But manufacturers insisted that the possibility of the chemical reaction has been long known. Dr Emma Meredith, of the Cosmetic, Toiletry & Perfumery Association, said the law forbids using secondary amines in a form that can react in this way. George Hammer, the owner of Urban Retreat at Harrods, the world’s largest hair and beauty salon, said: ‘Chemical companies have a huge vested interest in keeping this under wraps.’ The warning is set out in the journal Materials. In 2009 the Mail revealed that women who use hair dyes more than nine times a year have a 60 per cent greater risk of contracting blood cancer. A year later the European Commission banned 22 hair dyes which put long term users at risk of bladder cancer.","Secondary amines can be found in hair dyes used by millions of Britons .

"It sounds like the plot for a new Indiana Jones film. Archaeologists say they have discovered the 'Gates of Hell', the mythical portal to the underworld in Greek and Roman legend. The site, in the ancient Phrygian city of Hierapolis, now Pamukkale in southwestern Turkey, is said to closely match historical descriptions of what was known as Ploutonion in Greek and Plutonium in Latin. Gates of Hell: A digital reconstruction of the site in Southern Turkey that has just been discovered by a team of architects from Italy . In its heyday, a small temple with traditional Greco-Roman pillars was said to have stood next to wall with steps leading down to a cave doorway filled with foul and noxious gasses. Describing the site, the Greek geographer Strabo (64/63 BC -- about 24 A.D.) said: 'This space is full of a vapor so misty and dense that one can scarcely see the ground. 'Any animal that passes inside meets instant death. I threw in sparrows and they immediately breathed their last and fell.' The site, in the ancient Phrygian city of Hierapolis, now Pamukkale in southwestern Turkey, is said to closely match historical descriptions . Just like in the historic texts, birds that flew to close to the opening were killed by the carbon dioxide fumes . Spectators: The steps next to the temple from where people were believed to watch  the sacred rites . But now a team led by Italian Archaeologist Francesco D'Andria, professor of classic archaeology at the University of Salento, has discovered what they believe to be the ruins of the site. Announcing the discovery at a conference on Italian archaeology in Istanbul, Mr D'Andria said he and his team had managed to pinpoint the location by reconstructing the route of a thermal springs. Archaeologists now believe that a large statue found at the site, . previously believed to depict Apollo, is  actually of Hades, Greek god of the underworld . Among the ruins the archaeologists found a cave with Ionic semi columns upon which were inscriptions with dedications to the gods of the underworld -- Pluto and Kore. Mr D'Andria told Discovery News: 'We could see the cave's lethal properties during the excavation. 'Several birds died as they tried to get close to the warm opening, instantly killed by the carbon dioxide fumes.' The archaeologist, who famously claimed to have found the tomb of Saint Philip, one of the 12 apostles of Jesus Christ, in Hierapolis, in 2011. The ancient city was founded around 190BC by Eumenes II, King of Pergamum. It was taken over by the Romans in 133 B.C.. Under Roman rule the city flourished. There were temples, a theater and people flocked to bathe in the hot springs which were believed to have healing properties. Today Pamukkale is well known for the stunning white travertine terraces which are the result of the hot springs. Mr D'Andria has conducted extensive archaeological research at Hierapolis and two years ago he claimed to discover there the tomb of Saint Philip, one of the 12 apostles of Jesus Christ. D'Andria also found the remains of a . pool and the steps placed above the cave which match the descriptions of . the site in ancient sources. Among the ruins the archaeologists discovered Ionic semi-columns with inscription to gods of the underworld  Pluto and Kore . The network of thermal springs that led archaeologists to the site is also responsible for the creation of the stunning White Travertine Terraces of Pamukkale . Speaking to Discovery TV channel he gave a fascinating description of what life might have been like around the cave in ancient times. He . said: 'People could watch the sacred rites from these steps, but they . could not get to the area near the opening. Only the priests could stand . in front of the portal. According . to the archaeologist, pilgrims arriving at the site were given small . birds to test the deadly effects of the cave, while priests sacrificed . bulls to Pluto hallucinating madly from the toxic fumes. The site remained fully functional until the 4th century A.D. and  became an important pilgrimage destination for the last pagan intellectuals.

"Two 'untrained' sailors who bought their yacht on eBay smashed their boat onto rocks after getting lost just 400 yards into what was believed to be one of their first voyages. The hapless pair went out in their £3,000 24ft vessel but were soon left teetering on a reef near the entrance to St Peter Port harbour in Guernsey. These unnamed sailors had 'little or no knowledge' of the area or sailing and were attempting to move the yacht from one marina to another - only 700 metres away - when they ran it aground in the dark. Unaware of the rocks until their pale blue boat Ardel crashed into them, they were forced into a Mayday emergency call to the coastguard and a lifeboat was sent to rescue them. Lost: The pair of rookie sailors were on a 700 metre night-time cruise in the yacht they bought off eBay but smashed into rocks . But it could not get near the rocks so the local harbour master organised for the bungling seamen to be rescued by a dinghy at 2am yesterday. The stranded yacht is now drawing crowds to Goubeau Reef off the Channel Island. Subsequent tides have not been as big as the one that deposited the boat on the rocks and the yacht will remain there until a larger tide comes, or waves smash her to pieces. Richard Poat, 52, a plumbing inspector who lives near the harbour entrance, said he awoke yesterday morning to see the stranded yacht. He said: 'I woke up and saw the boat on the rocks that is only about 100 metres from the harbour. Mystery: The two men managed to run aground just short of St Peters port harbour in Guernsey at the weekend in their £3,000 yacht Ardel . 'I heard that the people on board were two Sikh gentlemen who had clearly not been aware of the reef. 'They were probably on the high tide at about 1am or 2am because that would have been the best time to move. 'They were between the Queen Elizabeth II marina and the harbour entrance and there is the reef between them. 'I went out on my boat to have a closer look and I’d be surprised if it survived when it comes off. 'There are quite a few people going out to have a look.” Captain Peter Gill, the Guernsey harbour master, said: 'It happened just outside St Peter Port and the yacht was attempting to move from the QE II marina to another marina inside the harbour. Error: The boat will not be dislodged unless there is a very high tide, meaning that it is more likely to be smashed to pieces by the waves and rocks . 'They were doing it in the middle of the night and the distance is about 700 metres. They were about 400 metres into the journey. 'The people on board had little or no knowledge of the area and were not local. They were two men and were uninjured. 'In the end a harbour dinghy took them off because the lifeboat couldn’t reach them. 'They had been on the top of the tide and it deposited them on the rocks. 'Subsequent tides have not been as big so the yacht hasn’t floated off yet. The next tide that might do it is this afternoon. 'If that doesn’t do it then it might be lucky to survive because the weather forecast doesn’t look good. 'I heard that the men had bought the yacht off eBay. 'A similar thing happened last year with a French yacht, but before that it was several years before we had another incident.'","The hapless men got caught on the tide in St Peter Port Guernsey and were dumped on a reef .

"A woman left heartbroken by seven miscarriages has finally achieved her dream of becoming a mother - thanks to a stitch in her cervix and daily doses of aspirin. Samantha Bourner had spent a traumatic 12 years trying to start a family since meeting her husband, David, in 2003. The 33-year-old initially became pregnant after two years, but was devastated when she lost the baby - whom she had named after her grandfather Alfie - at just 22 weeks. Over the next decade she suffered another five miscarriages and almost gave up hope of ever having a child. Samantha Bourner, 33, suffered seven miscarriages and she and her husband David, 35, nearly gave up on ever having a child. On December 3 2014 she gave birth to Noel Arthur Paul - thanks to a stitch in her cervix . Mrs Bourner said Noel had a personality straight away. She said: 'He likes lots and lots of cuddles and attention and doesn't like going down in his bed' She was diagnosed with Antiphospholipid syndrome, which causes an increased risk of blood clots and raises the risk of miscarriage in pregnant women. Doctors said the condition – which causes the blood to be 'too sticky' - could be causing her recurring miscarriages. They prescribed aspirin, which helps thin the blood, and another drug called Clexane which stops blood clots forming. Last March Mrs Bourner became pregnant for a seventh time and was delighted when doctors told her she would be having twins. But she lost one of the babies at just nine weeks, and she and her husband David, 35, feared the other child would not survive. However, doctors inserted a stitch into her cervix, which stops it opening too early, reducing the chance of a miscarriage. On December 3 Mrs Bourner gave birth to Noel Arthur Paul four weeks early by emergency Caesarean section. Mrs Bourner, from Hamstreet, Kent, said: 'It's been a long time coming but nothing prepares you for being a mum. 'It's a lot harder than I thought it would be and I'm always tired. 'But it's really exciting, watching every stage he goes through. Just seeing him every day is amazing. 'I never felt safe during the pregnancy. 'Everyone was getting really excited but right up until the point I was holding him I thought it was going to go wrong.' Mrs Bourner, who runs a craft company, added: 'Noel had a personality pretty much straight away. A cervical stitch is also known as a cervical suture or cervical cerclage. It involves 'stitching' a tape around the cervix to support it. This aims to keep the cervix closed and therefore to help prevent a baby being born too early. Doctors might advise a cervical stitch because they believe the woman has a weakness in the cervix – they call this ‘cervical incompetence’. This means the cervix runs the risk of opening before the end of a 40-week pregnancy, and maybe even very early on in pregnancy. If the cervix opens, there is an increased risk of the baby being born early and not surviving, or surviving with a serious risk of long-term problems. Source: Miscarriage Association . 'He likes lots and lots of cuddles and attention and doesn't like going down in his bed. 'He can be fast asleep in your arms and as soon as you put him down he's wide awake. He also loves being in the bath.' Noel was born at St Mary's Hospital in London weighing 5lb14oz - but Mrs Bourner still had worries right to the last minute. During her pregnancy, Mrs Bourner had suffered from gestational diabetes – a condition affecting pregnant women where there is too much glucose in the blood - and had to go on a strict low sugar diet. Then, one morning she woke up to discover she had been bleeding overnight and dialled 999 in tears. She told the operator she thought she had lost another baby and was rushed to hospital, where doctors performed an emergency Caesarean immediately. When Noel was born, Mrs Bourner said his first cry sounded 'amazing'. She believes her son's twin, whom she lost at nine weeks old, may actually have helped Noel to survive. The twin was absorbed into the womb rather than being miscarried in the normal way, a condition known as a 'vanishing twin' which sometimes occurs when more than one baby develops in the womb. Mrs Bourner said: 'Noel was always on one side of my tummy to begin with but when his twin died he moved over to where they had been. 'I think he was looking for him or her. The sibling was a vanishing twin, I never miscarried, it was reabsorbed into the womb. 'I believe that second twin meant there were extra hormones from that brief little life to help keep the other going.' Research suggests that vanishing twin syndrome occurs in roughly a third of pregnancies in which an early ultrasound detects two or more developing babies. After years of heartbreak, Mrs Bourner and her husband are delighted to be parents. Mrs Bourner said: 'We are over the moon with Noel, he really is a miracle and I adore him.' While Mrs Bourner says she is thrilled to finally be a mother, she currently has no plans to try for another baby. 'People keep saying now we've done it once we could do it again. 'But I would have to have to have that exact combination of hormones, supplements and diets - and even then it might not happen,' she said. 'It puts a strain on your body and doctors have said it might be dangerous for me to have another child. 'We are over the moon with Noel, he really is a miracle and I adore him.' Experts say just one per cent of couples suffer three or more miscarriages, so Mrs Bourner's success after seven was remarkable. Ruth Bender Atik, national director of the Miscarriage Association, said: 'Random miscarriages are horribly common and one in four women will have at least one. 'It is a far smaller group that have one after another, after another. It is only one per cent of couples trying to conceive who will have three or more.' She added: 'When it happens again and again it becomes really hard to bear - for more than half of those people they will never find out why they are miscarrying. 'Some couples will keep trying and some of them just feel like they need to stop because they can't cope anymore. 'I am really happy to hear Samantha has had success but I'm sure that it won't stop her feeling the grief for the babies that she has lost.'","Samantha Bourner suffered six miscarriages and was left heartbroken .

"Morrisons is slashing the price of 1,200 everyday food essentials by up to 60 per cent, triggering a bloody price war that will force rivals to follow suit. The move by Britain’s fourth biggest supermarket is part of a £1billion plan to permanently reduce prices in a bid to see off the threat posed by budget rivals Aldi and Lidl. However, the price re-set will also drag the other members of the grocery big four – Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s – into the fray. The move by Britain's fourth biggest supermarket is part of a £1billion plan to permanently reduce prices in a bid to see off the threat posed by budget rivals Aldi and Lidl . All these rivals have price pledges which means they will have to match – or beat – the reductions offered by Morrisons if they want to keep their promises to shoppers. The price cuts represent a huge gamble for Morrisons, however bosses see a permanent shift to discount prices as the only way to reverse a long running fall in shopper numbers, sales and profits. The fall-out of the battle for customers means that millions are in line to see significant savings which should hasten the end of a five year cost of living squeeze that has brought real hardship. The average price cut on the 1,200 lines is 17per cent, however a number of high profile products are down by between 25per cent and 60per cent. Morrisons British butter is down by a third from £1.49 to £1, its 500g packs of beef mince are down by 20per cent, bacon by 15per cent, Huggies wipes by 60per cent and an eight-pack of Diet Coke by 40per cent. One former executive has warned that the change in strategy is so serious for Morrisons’ finances and future that it has become a ‘supertanker headed towards an iceberg’. If that is the case, it may well also drag down its much bigger rivals by forcing them to accept lower prices and profits for years to come. The chief executive, Dalton Philips first announced a shift to permanent low prices in March, however the chain is now putting flesh on to the bones of its initiative. Morrisons chief executive Dalton Philips, pictured, said: 'We're serious about getting cheaper and setting new standards in transparency of pricing' He said: ‘Morrisons is now cheaper.  We are cutting prices not corners.  We are making great food even more affordable and, in doing so, giving more reasons for customers to shop with us.’ In the past, all the major supermarkets have launched price cut promotions, boasting of bigger and better offers. However, these have often not offered the savings claimed, leaving shoppers sceptical and confused. Morrisons is to challenge this problem by launching a website in May that will show the price history of products on its shelves to offer reassurances that they are showing genuine reductions. Mr Philips said: ‘We’re serious about getting cheaper and setting new standards in transparency of pricing. 'We are cutting prices not corners' - Chief executive Dalton Philips . 'We want our customers to be proud of the products they buy and be reassured that they are cheaper.  We have nothing to hide.’ The chain will back up the cuts by a new marketing campaign under the strapline ‘I’m Your New Cheaper Morrisons’. The first TV commercials will run tonight around Coronation Street and Emmerdale. Morrisons has an advantage over some of its big name rivals in that it processes and manufacturers a lot of food it sells, rather than relying on third party suppliers. The firm said: ‘We will be leveraging this vertically integrated structure to control to quality of products and to keep prices down, cost which competitors will find it hard to match.’ City analysts have long predicted that only significant price cuts by the ‘big four’ stores will allow them to fend off the challenge of the German budget chains Aldi and Lidl. Recent industry figures show Aldi sales rising at 35.3per cent a year, while those at Lidl are up 17.2per cent as both make a concerted effort to expand and move into Middle Britain towns . By contrast, sales at Morrisons were down by 3.8per cent on a year ago, Tesco by 3per cent, Sainsbury’s by 1.7per cent and Asda, which is owned by Wal-Mart of the USA by 0.5per cent. The price cuts represent a huge gamble for Morrisons, however bosses see a permanent shift to discount prices as the only way to reverse a long running fall in shopper numbers, sales and profits . Earlier this year, Morrisons dismayed City analysts with a report of a pre-tax loss of £176million for the year to February 2, compared with a pre-tax profit of . £879m the year before. Turnover fell by 2per cent to £17.7bn. The firm has suffered because it was late to follow rivals and open smaller convenience stores, while it delayed launching an internet grocery service. It is now addressing these, while it has also signed an expensive advertising deal featuring Ant and Dec. The Morrisons change to prices is enormously risky and controversial. Former executive, Roger Owen, a property director with the supermarket for 22 years until 2009, recently claimed that the chief executive, Mr Philips, was ‘out of his depth’, while he said the chairman, Sir Ian Gibson, should stand down. It has emerged that he wrote a letter to Sir Ian spelling out his ‘increasing sadness at the unarguable decline of the company I helped build’, while he suggested it was a supertanker heading for an iceberg. The chain described his attacks as ‘unhelpful’ and ‘unwelcome’ and suggested Mr Owen should take some responsibility for the problems the current management are wrestling with. A source said: ‘He might be better served taking more of a thoughtful view of his role as a director of a board that left Morrisons, uniquely amongst the big grocers, with no online and no convenience offer.’","Prices of 1,200 everyday food essentials to be slashed by up to 60 per cent .

"Tesco is launching a massive counter-offensive against pound shop stores as it battles to stem the loss of customers to budget outlets. The nation’s biggest retailer has begun opening heavily-promoted 'pound shop' areas within its stores in a bid to take on thriving Poundland and other low-cost chains. The new zones have so far been introduced to more than 60 Tesco stores, and the retailer plans to increase this figure to nearly 300 over the next few weeks. Discounts: Tesco has announced that it is rolling out hundreds of new 'Pound Shop' areas (file picture) Pugh . A range of products will be sold for as little as 50p, including items such as health products, kitchen tissues, washing-up liquid, pet food and detergents. The Tesco launch highlights just how . severely the success of the pound shops is hitting the profits of . established supermarket giants in Britain. In recent years the no-frills budget shops have become a dominant force in UK retailing, with cash-strapped shoppers flocking to them on a regular basis. Poundland was founded in 1990 and has 450 stores countrywide, while Poundworld launched in 2004 and has 200 stores. In addition, 99p Stores has more than 200 outlets. Tesco Pound Shop buying manager Paul . Bangs said it wanted to ensure shoppers had access to a ‘vastly improved . range’ of discount products. Competition: The new zones have so far been introduced to more than 60 Tesco stores, as it aims to capture shoppers from Poundland (pictured) He said in a letter to suppliers: ‘This . is a project that Tesco is taking very seriously. As a new concept, . implementation will be absolutely key to success.’ Mr Bangs also told trade magazine The Grocer that the retailer would launch new point-of-sale marketing materials including header boards, hanging banners and other signs to encourage people to visit the new areas of the shops. The magazine added that Tesco has previously attempted to take on pound shops. A ‘pound shop’ strategy for food and non-food items was implemented in 2009, with an aisle in larger stores just for the lines. A £1 section was then rolled in about 50 stores in 2012. But one supplier told The Grocer: ‘Tesco are chasing their own shadow at the moment and this could just end with them just creating even more redundant space. ‘ . And Steve Dresser from Grocery Insight analysts said: ‘Tesco had to do something about the likes of Poundland but I think shoppers would rather find deals through the normal course of their shop than go down a couple of separate aisles.’ Aldi’s sales growth has accelerated to 34 per cent a year, while takings through the tills at Lidl are rising by an impressive 17 per cent. The budget chains have made a concerted effort to target middle Britain shoppers who have seen prices rise faster than incomes for the last five years. They have become known for produce, cheap dairy products and top European food and wine. Current British market share of the major supermarkets shows Tesco is still dominant but cheaper options are on the rise . Aldi and Lidl are targeting people with everything from fresh Aberbeen Angus fillet steaks at £5 each to award winning wine, coffee and cheese. And own-label tablets from Lidl and Aldi came second and third respectively in recent tests for the best dishwasher tablets by consumer watchdog Which? – and they were among the cheapest at 10p per wash. But while the German chains open shops at the rate of one a week, Tesco continues to lose sales despite a £1billion turnaround plan. Its sales in the 12 weeks to April were down by 3 per cent on a year ago. Last month it was revealed that Tesco's profits had fallen for the second year running as its rivals continue to eat into its market share, which is at a ten-year low. Britain's biggest supermarket posted a six per cent fall in its pre-tax profits to £3.3billion in the past 12 months, down from £3.45billion a year earlier. Tesco is still by far the biggest UK supermarket with 28.6 per of market share, but this is down from 29.7 per cent a year ago. Asda had 17.4 per cent, Sainsbury's had 16.5 per cent and Morrisons had 11.1 per cent in the year ending March 30. But all have faced a surge from competitors gobbling up customers, with Aldi's share of the market up from 3.4 per cent to 4.6 per cent in the past 12 months. Waitrose had 5 per cent compared with 4.8 per cent last year, and Lidl also experienced strong growth in a record-breaking month and now accounts for 3.4 per cent of the market. There is also a perception that with stores such as Waitrose clearly high-end, and Lidl and Aldi clearly low-end, Tesco is losing out on shoppers because it is sitting in the middle ground. Meanwhile in January, Steve Smith, who founded Poundland in 1990, revealed plans for an online store where everything costs £1. The minimum order value is likely to be £23, and a 'click-and-collect' system is being considered, which would allow customers to pick up their goods at other stores and shopping centres.","Tesco has introduced areas to 60 stores and wants them in total of 300 .

"Faye Walters, 29, eventually had a perfect smile for her wedding day - after five months of corrective treatment for a set of botched veneers . A young woman was devastated to be left with shattered black teeth just months before her wedding due to a botched set of veneers. Faye Walters, 28, had worn veneers since she was 15 after being bullied throughout her childhood for having discoloured teeth. She hoped a new set before her wedding would boost her self-confidence and was initially delighted with her new white smile. But she was horrified when her two of her teeth shattered when she bit into a bagel - and closer inspection revealed all the other veneers had turned grey. She discovered her gums and teeth had been badly damaged due to the botched veneers, fitted by a dentist she had known since she was a child. A veneer is a thin layer of porcelain made to fit over the front surface of a tooth, like a false fingernail fits over a nail. To make matters worse, she was then left with a £7,000 bill to fix her smile – along with five months' worth of corrective treatment. Miss Walters had not realised that her dentist, whom she had been visiting for years, had no extra qualifications or training for fitting veneers. After finding a dentist who specialised in veneers, her teeth were saved and she had a perfect smile for her wedding. She is now sharing her story in the hope that others will do their research before having veneers fitted. Miss Walters, from Buckingham, said: 'It was only after my veneer completely shattered when I was eating a bagel that I discovered the full extent of the problem. 'It was disgusting, I could see my tooth was black. It was something I was so conscious of because of the bullying I'd suffered at school. 'Playground bullies picked on me for having large front teeth that were discoloured due to mineral imbalances. 'I was so upset that my mum decided I needed veneers.' After being fitted with her first set at 15, she had no problems until they were replaced in 2010 at a cost of around £2,000. Miss Walters added: 'After my tooth shattered and the other veneer cracked, I lost faith in my old dentist so I went online to do some research to try and understand what sort of qualifications people should have to fit them. 'I discovered there were courses for dentists to make sure they have all the information they need to fit veneers properly, and that my original dentist didn't have those. Miss Walters had six veneers fitted by her local, trusted dentist in July 2010. Initially she was happy with the result, but they later shattered as she was biting into a bagel. It emerged her teeth had cracked, turned black and grey and her gums had been damaged . 'I found one who did and when he saw my teeth he was horrified. 'He said it was the worst case of its kind he had seen in his 25-year career. 'The new dentist told me the veneers had not been fitted correctly and there was a gap between my gums and the veneers. 'This meant bacteria was getting in and eating away at the bond which holds everything together.' A veneer is a thin layer of porcelain made to fit over the front surface of a tooth, like a false fingernail fits over a nail. Veneers can improve the colour, shape and position of teeth. A precise shade of porcelain can be chosen to give the right colour to improve a single discoloured tooth or to lighten the front teeth. A veneer can make a chipped tooth look intact again. The porcelain covers the whole of the front of the tooth with a thicker section replacing the broken part. Veneers can also be used to close small gaps, when braces are not suitable. If one tooth is slightly out of position, a veneer can sometimes be fitted to bring it into line with the others. Veneers should last for many years; but they can chip or break, just as teeth can. Small chips can be repaired, or a new veneer fitted if necessary. Porcelain veneers should last between five and twenty years, while composite veneers last a year or two at most. The costs for this treatment can vary from practice to practice so it is important to discuss charges and treatment options with the dentist before starting treatment. All six of Miss Walters' veneers needed replacing and she also had to undergo painful treatment on her gums, as well as ongoing treatment to tackle the gum disease she was left with. The treatment cost £7,366.20 and had to be carried out over a five-month period, but was thankfully complete before her wedding to fiancé Matthew, 35, in September 2014. Miss Walters said: 'I was planning my wedding and all I could think about was how grey my teeth would look in the photographs, or the possibility of having a veneer falling out.' She took legal action against her old dentist who had fitted her six veneers so poorly. She was eventually paid £10,000 in compensation, covering the cost of her new set, and also helping to compensate for her pain and suffering. Now, with her teeth fully repaired and her gums healed, she has a nice set of wedding pictures in which include plenty of smiles. But Miss Walters says she will never forget her ordeal and is calling for much tighter regulation of dentists. 'I don't think dentists should be allowed to perform cosmetic dental procedures without having gone through additional training,' she said. 'My first dentist had lots of certificates in his waiting room and I always felt as though I could trust him as he was a professional. 'I didn't know there was anything drastically wrong and because I trusted him I never questioned it. 'He had been my dentist since I was a little girl and I had known him all my life. 'Thankfully my new dentist cleaned my teeth and managed to save them before fitting my new veneers. They are great now and everything has healed.' Sarah Smith, litigation assistant at Neil Hudgell Solicitors, represented Miss Walters in her compensation claim. Miss Walters found a new dentist who was able to restore her teeth in time for her wedding to Matthew, 35, in September 2014. She is now calling for cosmetic dentists to be regulated . She believes the case is a good example of the need for greater regulation of industries such as cosmetic surgery and dentistry. She said: 'All too often we represent clients who have suffered as a result of dental or cosmetic surgery negligence and, as in this case, patients can suffer both financially and emotionally. 'Having veneers fitted is a very costly procedure and we were very pleased to have secured a positive outcome for Faye. 'However, we hope her case sends out a clear message to others that cosmetic dentistry, and any form of cosmetic surgery, is not something people should rush into.' Before seeking treatment, check the dentist is registered with the General Dental Council . In the UK, the General Dental Council has lists of all registered dentists. Before you seek treatment, check the dentist is registered. Some dentists with special training or experience will also be on the Specialist Lists and can call themselves a ‘specialist’. These include areas such as orthodontists - who prevent or correct irregularities in the teeth, bite and jaw and prosthodontics - who are qualified to replace missing teeth by crowns, bridges, dentures which may be fixed or removable.

"Scientists have sent a ‘mental message’ from one person to another 4,000 miles away in what they claim is the world’s first successful telepathy experiment. They connected one person in Mumbai, India, to a wireless headset linked to the internet, and another person to a similar device in Paris. When the first person merely thought of a greeting such as ‘ciao’, Italian for ‘hello’, the recipient in France was aware of the thought occurring, according to a report in the journal PLOS One. Scroll down for video . Telepathic breakthrough: Scientists believe they have sent signals from one brain to another (file photo) The subject receiving the message could not comprehend the word itself, but could report flashes of light in their brain that corresponded to the exact moment when the word ‘ciao’ was being thought. The experiment was carried out by experts from Harvard University, who claim it shows technology can be used to transmit information from one person’s brain to another. Giulio Ruffini, a theoretical physicist and co-author of the research, said: ‘It is kind of technological realization of the dream of telepathy, but it is definitely not magical. ‘We are using technology to interact electromagnetically with the brain.’ Harvard neurology professor and research co-author Alvaro Pascual-Leone said they wanted to see if they could use ‘existing pathways’ to find out if ‘one could communicate directly between two people by reading out the brain activity from one person and injecting brain activity into the second person’. Science or science fiction? Telepathy is common in fantasy characters including X-Men's Prof Xavier (centre) ‘One such pathway is, of course, the internet, so our question became, “Could we develop an experiment that would bypass the talking or typing part of internet and establish direct brain-to-brain communication?”.’ Extra care was taken to make sure no sensory information got in the way that could have influenced the interpretation of the message, the researchers said. Dr Ruffini added: ‘We hope that in the longer term this could radically change the way we communicate with each other.’ The concept is being developed to help create prosthetic limbs that can be controlled by the mind.","Study in journal PLOS One connected people in Mumbai, India, and Paris .

"The U.S. is adding 350 more troops to help protect the American Embassy in Baghdad and its support facilities in the capital, amid growing fears of an ISIS attack. President Barack Obama approved the additional troops for protection of American personnel following a request by the State Department and a review and recommendation by the Defense Department, the White House said in a statement. The buildup of U.S. troops in Baghdad follows the growing threat from Islamic State militants in northern Iraq. Earlier on Tuesday, ISIS had released a video showing the beheading of captured American journalist Steven Sotloff. President Barack Obama waves as he boards Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base on Tuesday, the same day that he authorized 350 more troops to be assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad . In the video entitled 'A Second Message to America,' Sotloff appears in a orange jumpsuit before he is beheaded by an Islamic State fighter. The executioner  – known as ‘Jihadi John’ - tells the camera: 'I’m back, Obama, and I’m back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State.' Sotloff is the second American journalist to be killed by ISIS, and his death comes two weeks after James Foley was executed in a similar video. Since early August the U.S. has carried out 114 airstrikes against the militants, the latest taking place near Mosul Dam on Monday. In the video released of Sotloff's execution, 'Jihadi John' tells the camera that his death is due to 'your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State . The decision raises the number of U.S. forces in the country to over 1,000. The additional troops will not serve in a combat role, the White House said. Most are from the Army and some are Marines, the Pentagon said in a statement. Approximately 820 troops have now been assigned to augment diplomatic security in Iraq, said Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon's spokesman. The additional troops will come from within the U.S. Central Command area of operations and will include a headquarters element, medical personnel, associated helicopters and an air liaison team, Kirby said. Fifty-five troops in Baghdad since June will be redeployed outside of Iraq and replaced by 405 newly deployed troops, he said. The airstrike on Monday near Mosul Dam involved fighters and attack aircraft that damaged or destroyed 16 armed vehicles, Central Command said in a statement late on Tuesday.","Troops - Army and some Marines - will have a mission to protect the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad rather than serve in a combat role .

"The number of men taking their own lives has reached its highest rate in more than a decade, with those aged 45 to 59 most at risk. New figures published today reveal men are three times more likely to commit suicide than women. Experts warn the trend is down to the fact men are more likely to drink heavily, self-harm and are often more reluctant to seek help. Moreover for those aged 45 to 59 suicide rates are likely to be higher because they are typically the 'hardest hit by redundancy and unemployment' and see no way out. Meanwhile leading charity the Samaritans said the figures are 'unsurprising' in light of the still challenging economic climate. The number of men committing suicide has reached its highest rate in more than a decade with those aged 45 to 59 most at risk, new figures published by the Office for National Statistics revealed (file picture) The Office for National Statistics figures show a total of 6,233 suicides in people aged 15 or over in 2013, up 252 deaths or four per cent on the previous year. The suicide rate in the UK was 11.9 deaths per 100,000 of the population, with the male suicide rate reaching its highest level since 2001, at 19 male deaths per 100,000. Of the total number of suicides, 78 per cent were male (4,858 deaths), and 22 per cent (1,375 deaths) were female, the ONS said. From 1995 to 2012 records show men aged 30 to 44 were most likely to take their own lives. But in 2013, suicide rates among those aged 45 to 59 were highest, at 25 deaths per 100,000 - the highest for that age group since 1981, and the first time the age group has recorded the highest overall male rate. In 2013 the only age group were male suicides fell was the 15 to 29 year olds age range. The Samaritans today called for greater focus on suicide prevention policies, particularly in areas with higher levels of deprivation. Offering insight into why men are more prone to killing themselves, Professor Louis Appleby, chair of the National Suicide Prevention Advisory Group, said: 'Men are more at risk of suicide because they are more likely to drink heavily, use self-harm methods that are more often fatal and are reluctant to seek help. 'Fifteen years ago the rates among men under 35 were brought down sharply by tackling these problems and we need to use this success to address the problems of the new highest risk group, middle aged men. 'We need to make it easier for men to find help without shame or stigma.' Urging health bodies to see the figures as a 'wake-up call' Professor Shirley Reynolds, from Reading University, said one of the reasons for the rise in suicides is the fact only around '15 per cent of those with depression and anxiety seek help'. She said: 'It's a damning statistic. 'Effective treatment for depression exists but in general men are a minority of those seeking treatment for depression in the NHS. 'This could be because they are less willing or able to identify problems such as depression - or that they are less willing to ask for help. 'We know that men, on average, do not use the NHS for physical health problems as readily as women. Professor Louis Appleby, chair of the National Suicide Prevention Advisory Group, said: 'Men are more at risk of suicide because they are more likely to drink heavily, use self-harm methods that are more often fatal and are reluctant to seek help.' (File picture posed by a model) 'Mental health and psychological therapy services need to be made more attractive and accessible to men. 'Unemployment, depression and suicide go hand in hand. Suicide rates may also reflect local economic conditions which could explain some of the regional variation.' She said it is possible those aged 45 to 59 are more prone to suicide because they have been 'hardest hit by redundancy and unemployment, and see no plausible improvement for themselves'. She added they may also find it 'particularly hard' to help. She said as a whole mental health needs to be taken more seriously by society and called for a 'significant investment' in research. In addition Professor Reynolds said there must be a complete 're-think' on how treatment is offered, if society is to tackle depression and suicide. Women aged 45 to 59 had highest female suicide rate with seven deaths per 100,000 . Total female suicide rate was 5.1 deaths per 100,000 across the UK . In England the suicide rate was 10.7 deaths per 100,000 . In Wales the rate was 15.9 deaths per 100,000 . Suicide remains leading cause of death in England and Wales for men aged 20 to 34 - accounting for 24 per cent of all deaths in 2013 . Also leading cause of death for men aged 35 to 49 years, accounting for 13 per cent of all deaths . Men aged 15 to 29 were the only age group to record a decrease in the rate of suicides in 2013 to 12.5 deaths per 100,000 from 13.6 in 2012 . Suicide also leading cause of death among women aged 20 to 34 in England and Wales, accounting for 12 per cent of all deaths . Reacting to the figures, Joe Ferns, Samaritans executive director of policy, research and development, said: 'The excessive risk of suicide in men at mid-life continues to be a concern. 'The rate for this group has now reached its highest level for more than 30 years. 'These figures cannot be ignored.' The charity's Men and Suicides report concludes that men from lower socio-economic backgrounds, living in deprived areas are around 10 times more likely to take their own lives than those living in affluent areas. Mr Ferns noted the suicide rate in men varies dramatically across geographic regions. In the North East rates were highest in 2013, while London had the lowest suicide rate across the UK. He added: 'Sadly, we know that suicide is an inequality affecting people in the most deprived areas from the most disadvantaged backgrounds. 'The All Party Parliamentary Group on Suicide Prevention and Self Harm recently reported on how varied local suicide prevention activity can be. 'It found that around a third of local authorities do not collect information about suicide, do not have a suicide prevention action plan, or a multi-agency suicide prevention group. 'This is an issue which needs to be urgently addressed in the context of rising rates.' Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the mental health charity Sane, said: 'It is really shocking that men who are or could be in their prime of life should feel driven to such a state of hopelessness and despair for the future that they are taking their own lives. 'Our concern is the number of suicides which are preventable and the fact that when people with mental illness hit crisis point, there are no available beds or units and they are sent home from A&E and left to suffer in silence.' A Department of Health spokeswoman said: 'Losing a loved one to suicide is a tragedy and one life taken by suicide is one too many. 'Our Suicide Prevention Strategy is backed by £1.5 million funding for research and we've set a zero suicide ambition to tackle the assumption that some suicides are inevitable. 'We're also introducing the first ever waiting time standards for mental health, backed by £120 million investment. 'And we're taking action to improve crisis support across the country, with new standards set out in the Crisis Care Concordat and investment in liaison psychiatry.'
