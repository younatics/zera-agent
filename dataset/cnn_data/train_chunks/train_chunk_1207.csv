"Boris Johnson has admitted to being pursued by the U.S. authorities for an unpaid tax demand. The Conservative mayor of London - who was born in New York and holds an American passport -  revealed that he is refusing to pay a demand issued to him for capital gains tax. The demand reportedly relates to his first home in the UK, which he said was not subject to capital gains tax in England. Boris Johnson has admitted to being pursued by the U.S. authorities for an unpaid tax demand . According to U.S. tax law all citizens are required to file a tax return and pay U.S. taxes, even those with dual citizenship and those who earned income abroad. Mr Johnson revealed he was being chased for the payment during an interview with National Public Radio during his visit to the country to promote his book about Winston Churchill, The Churchill Factor. His initially unremarked upon claims, made on November 13, came after he was asked about renouncing his US citizenship, which the caller said was 'very hard'. Mr Johnson said: 'I have to confess to you, that you're right, it is a very - it is very hard, but I will say this, the great United States of America does have some pretty tough rules, you know. 'You may not believe this but if you're an American citizen, America exercises this incredible doctrine of global taxation, so that even though tax rates in the UK are far higher and I'm Mayor of London, I pay all my tax in the UK and so I pay a much higher proportion of my income in tax than I would if I lived in America. 'The United States comes after me, would you believe it, for the - for capital gains tax on the sale of your first residence which is not taxable in Britain, but they're trying to hit me with some bill, can you believe it?' Presenter Susan Page then pressed him whether he would pay the bill, to which he said: 'I think it's outrageous. 'Well, I'm - no is the answer. Why should I? I haven't lived in the United States for, you know, well, since I was five years old. 'I could but I pay - I pay the lion's share of my tax, I pay my taxes to the full in the United Kingdom where I live and work.' The Telegraph reports the home, in Islington, north London, wa bought by Mr Johnson and his barrister wife  in 1999 for £470,000. They sold the house for £1.2million in 2009. While in the UK he would not have been liable for capital gains tax as residents do not pay it on the sale of their first home, Diane Gelon, a US tax and immigration lawyer told the paper he could be facing a bill of over £100,000 in the States. Mr Johnson revealed he was being chased for the payment during an interview with National Public Radio during his visit to the country to promote his book about Winston Churchill, The Churchill Factor . Despite his reluctance to pay his own US tax bill, he has previously criticised the US embassy in London for not paying its unpaid congestion charge fine, the Guardian reports, which amounts to £7million. According to U.S. income tax laws, the foreign-earned income exclusion threshold was set at $97,600 (£62,000) last year, which Mr Johnson would be liable to pay as he earns well above this. His mayoral salary is £144,000 and he is reportedly paid £250,000 a year for his Telegraph column. The mayor's spokesman said he would not be commenting further. The Internal Revenue Service, the US government agency responsible for tax affairs, states on its website: 'If you are a US citizen or resident alien, the rules for filing income, estate, and gift tax returns and paying estimated tax are generally the same whether you are in the United States or abroad. 'Your worldwide income is subject to US income tax, regardless of where you reside.'","The demand relates to his first home in UK, Mr Johnson said in interview .

He posted dozens of pictures of his three children on his Facebook page. 'She was a precious little girl. I usually just saw her on her scooter,' neighbor Kay Stief told the Dallas Morning News. Many neighbors say they often saw her playing alone - either in her yard or on the neighborhood streets near her house. However, in the quiet suburban neighborhood, they said they usually didn't think too much of it. Police and the FBI searched the girl's home for several hours on Tuesday, carrying out boxes of documents and computers.

'I . said, ""Well, let’s pick it up, let’s put it in the trash can,"" you . know, because we’re a clean community,' he told the Morning News. What he found shocked him to his core. He ran back home and told his mother: 'Mom, it’s a little girl.' Whiddon's friend Josh Smith, 18, told KXAS-TV that he is will never be the same after seeing the girl dead. 'At first, I just thought it was some . rubber stuff at first, and then I got a closer look and all I saw was a . bag and I saw some hair sticking out and so, I was like, ""Oh my God! It’s a girl!""' he said. 'And that’s when I dropped to my knees and just started crying.' The girl's body was found in Saginaw, Texas, a city of 20,000 outside Forth Worth . Coping: Neighbors quickly set up a makeshift memorial on the curb for the little girl. It was torched along with the family's car Friday . Katie Whiddon, Owen's mother, told KTVT-TV that she didn't believe her son at first. When he convinced her he was telling the truth, she called 911. 'I was panicking. I was freaked out. How can somebody hurt a little girl?' she said. Ms Whiddon told KDFW-TV . that the girl was naked except for a bear of purple underwear and her . hands and feet were bound. She had a plastic grocery bag over her head. Police . say they are still not sure when the girl's body was dumped. Some . neighbors said they noticed the tarp in the road about noon. Others say . they didn't see it until about 7pm. Neighbors . said her father started looking for her about 9pm Tuesday - an hour and . a half after he body was found. They recalled him going door-to-door . asking if anyone had seen his daughter. 'You could tell on his face, he didn’t know what to do,' Mr Janus, the neighbor, told the Star-Telegram. 'It was like he was in shock and that he didn’t know where else to look.' Another . neighbor, Derinda, told the Morning News that she saw Alanna's mother . around that time, too.

About . 9.15pm, Mr Janus said he saw Alanna's father walk over to two police . cruisers that had parked on his street. He believes that is when the . parents reported their young daughter missing. Alanna's two other siblings are staying with family friends while their parents are being questioned by police. Neighbors say they noticed a red . pickup truck with a green splotch on the rear passenger-side panel in . the neighborhood shortly before the body was found.

"I'm not invincible: Lizzie says giving up drinking has been tough but she has learnt a harsh lesson . For a woman famous for commentating on the pampered existence of footballers' wives, Lizzie Cundy's own life is a cautionary tale for any aspiring WAG. We meet at lunchtime in a West London cafe, yet she is dressed up as if ready for a night out, in drainpipe jeans, thigh-high leather boots and a black leather biker jacket. Tumbling mahogany hair frames her heavily made-up face, which is prettier, softer and less severely Botoxed in real life than photographs frequently suggest. I've often bumped into Lizzie at celebrity parties where she's a fixture, dolled up and teetering on vertiginous heels, a glass of champagne permanently clamped in her expensively manicured hand. She is warm and quick to laugh. Yet I often thinks she looks sad – and never more so than during our lunchtime meeting. At 46, Lizzie's alarmingly slender frame seems out of proportion with her surgically enhanced breasts, and she quickly admits: 'I have suffered periods of depression, to be honest.' Her weight is low, she says, because 'when I'm unhappy I find it hard to eat'. Last month, Lizzie revealed the shocking news that she is suffering from the pre-cancerous condition Barrett's Oesophagus, which she believes has been brought on by her 'out-of-control drinking'. 'I was never like my old friend George Best, but the truth is drink had become a problem for me,' she admits. 'I think it can happen for a lot of women who watch their calorie intake. I forget to eat and not even notice if I'd just had a banana or the odd canape. But a glass of fizz would give me a lift and keep me going while rushing around.' While she may once have 'had it all' – her ostentatious white wedding in 1994 to former Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur footballer Jason Cundy was, of course, covered in depth in Hello! magazine – Lizzie concedes that she turned to alcohol as a means of coping with the couple's bitter divorce, which was finalised in December 2012. She was brought up in leafy Richmond upon Thames. Her late father was art director at the Saatchi advertising agency, and her mother ran the Jaeger shop in Regent Street, Central London. Convent school-educated Lizzie abandoned her plans for university and began modelling after being discovered by legendary photographer Norman Parkinson when she was 18. She met Jason the following year, and the couple went on to have two sons – Josh, now 19, and James, 12. She nursed Jason through two bouts of testicular cancer, but he left her for opera singer Hannah Pedley in 2010. When their marriage ended, it was Lizzie who had to pay her unfaithful ex-husband a substantial settlement because he claimed to be 'broke'. With two children to raise, the pressure on Lizzie was intense. And drink became a solace. Scroll down for video . White wedding: Lizzie and footballer Jason Cundy on their big day in 1994. The couple divorced in 2012 . 'I wasn't staggering around drunk or behaving giddily,' she admits. 'But I was gradually drinking more and more. Nobody on the showbiz circuit wants to see a sad, moaning person – they want a happy Lizzie who is good for a laugh, and I have always tried to be.' Lizzie realised all was not well with her health when she began to experience severe heartburn last year. 'At the time, I was working on Wag! The Musical, doing TV and radio shows [London Style on Sky, and online radio station Fubar] and writing my magazine columns as well as doing the school run,' she recalls. 'So when I developed a few symptoms – recurrent heartburn and a lump in my throat that made it hard to swallow – I did something I would never recommend and I put off seeing my doctor.' When she finally did visit her GP, it was after a night of 'agony' that kept her from sleeping. 'I was having stabbing stomach pains and crawling around the floor of my house in the middle of the night,' she says. 'I thought I was having a heart attack, so I called the GP.' The doctor carried out a gastroscopy, which involved feeding a camera on a wire down her throat and into the stomach. He discovered that Lizzie had stomach ulcers. She was advised to cut down on drinking and was prescribed antibiotics. However, the pain and lump in her throat continued to be a problem, and last Christmas Lizzie returned to the clinic for a second round of tests. They revealed she was suffering from chronic acid reflux and pre-cancerous changes. Out on the town: With Tamara Ecclestone at a showbiz party last year . 'It's frightening. My doctor warned me, 'Carry on drinking, and you will die.' ' Barrett's Oesophagus can develop in one in ten patients who suffer recurrent bouts of heartburn, where digestive acids rise up from the stomach into the oesophagus (the tube that runs from the stomach to the throat), causing a burning sensation. A valve at the bottom of the oesophagus opens to allow food to pass through into the stomach when we swallow. In some people this valve is faulty and can lead to acid reflux or heartburn. Barrett's Oesophagus is usually treated simply with lifestyle changes, such as eliminating caffeine, alcohol and spicy foods, and eating smaller meals, but some patients will need to take medications that stop acid production. If a biopsy shows that there are continuing changes in the cells lining the gullet, a procedure called radiofrequency ablation is offered – a probe called an electrode is used to kill the abnormal cells with an electrical current. About one in 200 people with Barrett's Oesophagus go on to develop cancer of the oesophagus, Britain's fifth-biggest cause of cancer deaths – 7,000 people die of the disease every year. Lizzie has none of the usual risk factors for the condition – it is most common in men, the over-50s, smokers and those who are overweight. But she believes her case was triggered by her 'champagne lifestyle', and the diagnosis has been a wake-up call. 'It would be fair to say that there are a number of factors that can make acid reflux worse, including being overweight, certain foods, smoking and excessive alcohol,' says Professor Rebecca Fitzgerald, a consultant gastroenterologist at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. 'If ignored, long-term and persistent acid and bile exposure of the oesophagus can cause Barrett's Oesophagus.' Since her diagnosis, Lizzie avoids large meals, and has cut out spicy meals and acidic foods such as citrus fruits. She also takes the antacid medication Omeprazole, and has to return to her gastroenterologist for check-ups every three months. Dealing with her drinking has been a harder challenge. Despite being advised to cut out alcohol by her doctors, over the months, as her symptoms alleviated, Lizzie told herself she could have 'the odd one' but her heartburn returned with a vengeance. 'Maybe it's more to do with the fact I was not eating enough, so the acid from the drink was going straight into my throat and stomach lining without any food to soak it up,' she says. 'Little did I know the damage I was doing to my insides.' While Lizzie still attends A-list events – earlier this month she mingled with heart-throb actor Gerard Butler at the Hunger Games after-party at the Chiltern Firehouse – her glass will now contain sparkling elderflower juice. 'I have to abstain from alcohol completely because of the damage the booze has done to my throat. If I carry on, I risk losing my voice, then I will have no radio show, no career, and no income. I'm a single mother with two sons who depend on me,' she says. 'I don't mind admitting giving up drink is hard. I get cravings. But I know I can do it. All this has taught me something: I'm tough, but I'm not invincible.' MONDAY . Urinetown The Musical gala event . DRINKS: 4 glasses of champagne . CALS: 360 UNITS: 4 . TUESDAY .

Does unwinding with a couple of glasses of wine every night really mean you have a problem? If you admit to doing so, and don't stop within a couple of weeks, your GP might soon be suggesting you take anti-addiction drug nalmefene – once reserved for serious drinkers to help them get over the physical shock of going cold turkey. The reason is financial. It may save the NHS billions in the long run by averting treatment for alcohol-induced illnesses such as obesity (look at how many extra calories Lizzie consumed in a week), diabetes and liver disease. Yes, we may know someone who lived to be 104 while drinking a gin and tonic every lunchtime, but they're the lucky ones. Whether or not Lizzie's cancer scare was the result of drinking, it was a wake-up call to the fact that she was papering over emotional problems in her life with drink. The first step in tackling addiction is admitting you are out of control. But the key to overcoming it is recognising the reason you got there in the first place.","Lizzie is suffering from pre-cancerous condition Barrett's Oesophagus .

"Nancy Stowe was one of the few female officers on the tough streets of Belmont, North Carolina, in the 1970s. The 75-year-old grandmother has been retired for years, but she hasn't forgotten her skills and definitely hasn't lost her nerve. Stowe was sitting in the car at a gas station in Glastonia on Thursday night when her 22-year-old grandson was robbed by two men. They forced him to the ground and tried to steal his wallet, when his father, Doug Stowe, jumped out of the car and went to save his son, according to The Palm Beach Post. Then and now: Nancy Stowe was one of the few female officers on the tough streets of Belmont, North Carolina, in the 1970s. Now 75, this week she proved she's still got it . Scene: Nancy Stowe's son and grandson were attacked at this gas station Thursday night in Gastonia . However the bandits, much younger than Mr Stowe, pummeled him too. Thats when Nancy knew it was up to her. As a cop she was taught to stand tall and speak with authority. And so she did just that, getting out of the car and going straight up to the thugs. 'I didn’t have a weapon at all,' Nancy Stowe told The Palm Beach Post. 'I just got in between them. I said, ''Oh, no you don’t''. 'I said, ''That’s enough of this''.' Battered: Doug Stowe was beaten up when he tried to help his son, who was being robbed . Fearless: Nancy Stowe said she immediately knew what she had to do after witnessing the robbery . She had left her cellphone in the car, but raised her arm to make it seem as if it were in her hand. She pointed to her hand and said she had called 911 and that the robbers should leave. They then ran away. As they took off, Stowe hollered: 'And don’t try it no more tonight!’ Her son and grandson are both bruised but are fine. Police are hoping they will find the men using the surveilance footage from the gas station. Stowe also worked with the county Sheriff’s Department and the Police Department in Coats, North Carolina.","Nancy Stowe witnessed her son and grandson being robbed at a gas station in Gastonia, North Carolina, on Thursday night .

"Victims groups are outraged by a United Nations finding that life sentences being served by two of Australia's most notorious rapist-murderers are 'cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment'. Bronson Blessington and Matthew Elliott were 14 and 16 respectively when they murdered  20-year-old Janine Balding at Minchinbury, in Sydney's west in 1998. They were sentenced to life in jail two years later. The crime was one of the most notorious in Australian history, coming just two years after the rape and murder of nurse Anita Cobby  at Prospect, also in western Sydney, by five men who are also serving life sentences without the possibility of parole. In response to a complaint by lawyers on behalf of Blessington and Elliott, the United Nations Human Rights Committee has found their sentences are in breach of Australia's obligations under the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Matthew James Elliott, who was 16 when he raped and murdered Janine Balding in 1988. Janine Balding was 20 when kidnapped, raped and murdered by a gang including Bronson Blessington and Matthew Elliott in 1988. Murder victim Janine Balding was a bank teller who had recently moved to Sydney from Wagga Wagga when she was kidnapped, raped and murdered in 1988. Stephen 'Shorty' Jamieson was 22 when he, along with Bronson Blessington and Matthew Elliott, raped and murdered bank teller Janine Balding. Blessington and Elliott, along with three others, kidnapped Ms Balding at knifepoint from Sutherland train station, in Sydney's south, on September 8, 1988. She was driven to a park near Minchinbury where she was repeatedly raped then dumped in a lake and drowned. Ms Balding, a bank teller who had only recently moved to Sydney from Wagga Wagga, in the state's south, was engaged to be married. In sentencing, Justice Peter Newman said the crimes against Ms Balding were so barbaric that Blessington, Elliott and Stephen 'Shorty' Jamieson, who was 22 at the time of the murder, should die in jail. 'To sentence people so young to a long term of imprisonment is of course a heavy task,' Justice Newman said. 'However, the facts surrounding the commission of these crimes are so barbaric that I believe I have no alternative other than to impose upon (these) young prisoners, even despite their age, a life sentence. 'So grave is the nature of this case that I recommend that none of the prisoners in the matter should ever be released.' Almost a decade after Blessington, Elliott and Jamieson were sentenced, legislation was passed in NSW to keep them and seven other killers behind bars for the rest of their lives. The legislation also covered Ms Cobby's killers: John Travers, Michael Murdoch and Gary, Les and Michael Murphy. None of them can ever be released unless they are dying or incapacitated to a point they could not commit a crime. John Travers was one of five men who raped and murdered Anita Cobby in 1986. He is serving a life sentence and never to be released. Michael Murdoch is serving a life sentence for the murder of Anita Cobby in 1986. Michael Murphy was one of three brothers who along with two others raped and murdered nurse Anita Cobby. Leslie Murphy is serving a life sentence for the rape and murder of Anita Cobby. Gary Murphy, his brothers Les and Michael, as well as John Travers and Michael Murdoch raped and killed Anita Cobby in 1986. None of them will ever be released. The United Nations committee found that because the Blessington and Elliott sentences allowed no genuine chance of release, even with full rehabilitation, Australia was in was in breach of the pair's human rights. The committee found sentences imposed on children must allow for 'the possibility of review and a prospect of release, notwithstanding the gravity of the crime and the circumstances around it'. ""This does not mean that release should necessarily be granted. It rather means that release should not be a mere theoretical possibility and that the review procedure should be a thorough one.' The Sydney Morning Herald reported Janine Balding's family was horrified by the decision, which is not enforceable. The family wants Blessington, Elliott and Jamieson to die in jail. 'They knew what they were doing,"" David Balding said of his sister's killers. 'They should stay where they are. They have nothing to offer society. 'There have been a ridiculous amount of appeals already, including to the High Court. Each one has been rejected and each one has caused this family a huge amount of pain. 'Just when you think it's over, it's on again.' Peter Rolfe, president of the Support After Murder group, said it was 'absurd' that the UN would interfere in the punishment handed to murderers in Australia. 'Janine Balding was a completely innocent person who had the misfortune to be picked up and indescribably raped and tortured by these low lives,' Mr Rolfe told Daily Mail Australia. 'And yet they are crying out for help now when they made sure that Janine was in no position to receive any help at any stage.' Mr Rolfe said Janine's mother Bev, who died last year, would be horrifed by the findings. 'Bev, who was a lovely, lovely lady, would be absolutely mortified at (outside interference) into the punishment of the low lives that took away her daughter's life.' Human Rights Law Centre senior lawyer Ruth Barson, who represented Blessington and Elliott before the UN, said the decision questioned the legality of a system that did allow for consideration of rehabilitation. 'No one is questioning the terrible nature of the crimes committed, but an effective and lawful response to children committing such crimes requires more than simply locking them up and throwing away the key,' she said.","Janine Balding was raped and murdered in Sydney's west in 1988 .

"They had tried flashing signs, neon signs and staggered signs. But when lorry drivers continued to keep on driving their over-sized trucks though low tunnels, Australian authorities took the extreme measure of warning drivers with water signs. Drivers are greeted with a curtain of water falling from the entrance of tunnels with a huge 'stop' sign projected on to them. Scroll down for video . Eyecatching! The curtain of water means that drivers cannot fail to notice the instruction . For those who disregard the standard warning signs, the virtual barrier can prevent them damaging their vehicle - and the tunnel . Officials used the drastic methods to stop drivers continuously smashing into the roads and causing delays and damage . The ghostly mirages have been adopted in Sydney after officials and motorist tired of drivers repeatedly driving into low-overhead tunnels that are too small for their vehicles. The drastic measure was enforced after a string of incidents where lorry drivers caused huge traffic delays and damaged the structure of the bridges. Drivers ignoring conventional signs now sit up and take notice of the Softstop virtual barriers created by Laservision, Jalopnik reported. Clever technology creates the illusion . of a solid sign, forcing the drivers to stop - but if they cannot halt . in time, it won't have any physical impact on the vehicle. A string of incidents forced frustrated officials to come up with a new way to avoid accidents . Tailbacks caused by tunnel-related accidents can affect up to 12,000 motorists during peak time . Authorities in Sydney hope devastating incidents like this will be avoided by the curtain - which will not damage vehicles if they do not stop in time . Laservision said that the Sydney Harbour Tunnel has experienced more than 10,000 incidents of vehicles hitting the structure since it opened. The damage caused by too large vehicles crashing into the overhead of the tunnel affected up to 12,000 motorists at peak time, the company said. This method means that the drivers avoid damaging their vehicles, cargo and road infrastructure, MSN reported. A video shows just how effective the virtual barrier is. A lorry can be seen heading towards a tunnel too low for it to be able to pass through. The motorists passes by numerous overhead and roadside signs - some flashing, some simple neon signs - but all urging the driver to 'stop'. It is only with metres to spare that the curtain of water descends, with a huge 'stop' sign beamed on to it - and the lorry finally stops.","High-tech wall of water falls and 'stop' sign projected on to it .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has warned of a long, hot summer as he opened a Sydney swimming pool, but steered clear of mentioning climate change.

In that speech Mr Obama raised concerns about the impact of climate change on the Great Barrier Reef, but Ms Bishop said there was an 'issue' regarding the president's statement. ‘I can understand the Queensland Government’s concern because the Queensland government and Australia have committed significant resources, funding and effort to preserving and conserving the Great Barrier Reef,’ she told host Leigh Sales. ‘Indeed, I believe that we are demonstrating world’s best practise in working with the World Heritage Committee to ensure that the Great Barrier Reef is preserved for generations to come. ‘And I think that president Obama might have overlooked that aspect of our commitment to conserving the Great Barrier Reef.’ Prime Minister Tony Abbott during House of Representatives question time at Parliament House in Canberra .

"A three-meter shark forced swimmers out of the water at Sydney's iconic Bondi Beach on Saturday afternoon, sparking panic and bringing the whole beach to their feet. Beachgoers were evacuated from the packed water in the early afternoon, after lifeguards spotted the huge shark in the water, setting the beach's shark alarm off. The alert comes just hours after a second great white shark was found dead in nets 400m off the coast of Bondi Beach in Sydney, sparking fears for swimmers as the temperatures began to heat up. Jetskis were deployed to check out the water and ward off the shark, and people on the beach were prevented from re-entering the ocean. Scroll down for video .

Karl Hayes, editor for TriZone, was down at a packed Bondi Beach covering the first Bondi Splash and Dash race, when the alarm went off. 'The shark came in and just cleared the beach. The photos I took shows it was a big one, at least three meters long,' Mr Hayes said. 'Everyone got out of the water pretty quickly and the lifeguards launched the inflatables and jetskis and head off into the ocean,' he said. The shark alarm continually sounded, and Mr Hayes said that many beachgoers appeared panicked. 'The lifeguards found the shark and were trying to herd it away from the beach, trying hard to get it to leave out of the north end,' Mr Hayes said.

Mr Hayes said that people were eventually allowed back in the water, and seemed to have recovered from the shock of the shark sighting pretty quickly. 'People were back in the water and already swimming out near the rocks where the shark was,' he said. 'I had been out doing some underwater photography earlier in the day for the site and kept looking around, keeping an eye out,' he said. He said that those who were competing in the Splash and Dash Race were aware of the sharks that had been caught in the nets during the week, including former Olympian Courtney Atkinson and Commonwealth Games Bronze medalist Aaron Royle. 'Everyone was a bit nervous but they did the race anyway without too many dramas,' Mr Hayes said. 'It was a fantastic event, and I think it'll become an institution,' he said. Mr Hayes said that people were eventually allowed back in the water, and seemed to have recovered from the shock of the shark sighting pretty quickly . 'The shark came in and just cleared the beach. The photos I took shows it was a big one, at least three meters long,' Mr Hayes said . The sighting comes just hours after the second great white shark in a week was found near Bondi Beach. Ian Puckeridge, who works as a spear fisherman, spotted the shark lying dead in the net on Friday morning, Channel Seven reports. He told 7News said: 'It's quite awesome to see them in the water when they're alive, not so great when they're dead and laying on the bottom in a net.' It is estimated the shark had been trapped in the net for about two days. The Department for Primary Industries reportedly told 7News that inspectors had not found the shark on Friday morning and could not confirm it was caught in the nets. The first shark is thought to have died in the nets and was picked up by a contractor boat on behalf of the Fisheries department at around 11.30 am on Wednesday. It was taken from Bondi to the Fisheries wharf in Sydney harbour where it was unloaded into a container to be taken for testing and an autopsy. Photos taken by a witness on a nearby boat show the shark, hung from its mouth, being winched in the air by men in hard hats and high-vis jackets at the wharf. This second 2.5m great white shark was found dead at Bondi Beach on Friday morning . A spokesperson for the Department of Primary Industries told Daily Mail Australia: 'A male great white shark of approximately 2.5m in length was found in a shark net off Bondi Beach.' 'The shark was found during routine inspections by specialist contractors who carry out operations as part of the NSW Shark Meshing Program,' the Department confirmed. 'DPI research staff will conduct a necropsy (or autopsy) for research purposes, as is practice for some sharks caught in our shark nets as part of national and international research projects. This will be carried out by DPI research staff.' Witness Nick Wenham told Daily Mail Australia: 'It was definitely from Bondi Beach. It's a 2.5-3m great white that needed to be taken to the Fisheries for testing because it's a protected species.' The shark is thought to have died in the nets and was picked up by a Fisheries department boat . 'The shark was found during routine inspections,' the Department confirmed . Shark nets are on 51 beaches in New South Wales and are maintained by the Department of Primary Industries . 'It was dead with its tail removed. We followed the boat from Bradley's head in the harbour up to the fisheries where I took the pictures. 'The shark went into the container behind and they shut the doors as soon as it was in,' Mr Wenham added. 'The tail was on the back deck,' he pointed out. Michael Kennedy, director of the Humane Society International Australia, said shark nets 'are old fashioned and cruel and should be to be taken out'. A dog onboard the boat inspected the dead great white . Animal welfare campaigners believe shark nets are cruel and inhumane . 'DPI research staff will conduct a necropsy (or autopsy) for research purposes,' a Department spokesperson said . 'In theory if it is alive they are supposed to release them but if it died it should be used for research so it didn't die in vain,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'Groups like ours are totally opposed to shark nets … research recognises that they are a key threat to a whole range of species… but they are scared of what would happen if they are remove the nets,' Mr Kennedy said. 'Even people whose sons and parents have been killed in the surf don't want revenge killings … I think that is the attitude today in Australia.' Shark nets are on 51 beaches in New South Wales and are maintained by the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries. The nets are generally 150 metres long and 6m wide and can be established 500 metres from the beach. 'The program protects around two million people who swim at these beaches each year,' a Department spokesperson said. 'The nets do not stretch from one end of a beach to the other. They are not designed to create a total barrier between bathers and sharks. They are designed to deter sharks from establishing territories, thereby reducing the odds of a shark encounter,' they added.

Naked chef: The prints will be sold to raise money for Jamie Oliver's Food Foundation charity. Mr Shieff regularly appears on the chef's YouTube channel as he is a leading figure in the vegan and raw food movements . The parkour athlete came up with the idea after holding a similar shoot in Greece, the London Evening Standard reported. It took four days last November for fellow free running expert Jason Paul to take the pictures. 'These shots would not have been possible for a normal photographer,' Mr Shieff, 26, said. 'Not only did he need to climb too, but he also understands body positioning and posture. 'It was dangerous at times. We couldn't get permission from a lot of the buildings, so while the reaction was great from people who spotted us, some security guards were not happy. 'There were moments when you learn you are stronger than you think. Many situations were life or death.' The photographs were taken by fellow free running expert Jason Paul, who had to clamber up the buildings himself to take the pictures . Mr Shieff did not have permission to climb some of the buildings, angering security guards but entertaining members of the public who spotted him climbing up some of London's finest architecture . Naked ambition: 2009 World Freerun Championship winner Mr Shieff came up with the idea after holding a similar naked shoot in Greece . The images can be purchased for between £100 and £600, with a proportion of the money going to the Jamie Oliver Food Foundation . The project aimed to compare the 'rigid and linear' structure of London's architecture with the 'curves' of the human form, Mr Paul said.

Black Friday is predicted to be the UK's biggest shopping day, but, despite the name, Amazon is already offering cut-price deals on Christmas gifts. On Friday, high street shops and malls will open early as they battle with online retailers slashing prices, with Visa Europe predicting that £360,000 will be spent every minute, or £6,000 a second, on its cards. John Lewis has promised that its Never Knowingly Undersold commitment will remain in place on Friday where possible, with stores opening their doors to hordes of shoppers at 8am. John Lewis director of online Mark Lewis said: 'Black Friday has definitely become one of the key dates in the UK's shopping calendar.

VoucherCodes.co.uk said it would have a team of 50 people tracking and uploading codes, deals and flash sales from across the web on to a dedicated page for consumers navigating the sales. Experts behind a retail report which will be published next week believe the upward trend is linked to the rise of smartphones and tablets, which make it easier to shop online. But stores and shopping centres will see their share of festive spending fall  to 76.6 per cent, the equivalent to £56.8bn, the report will warn. That accounts for a 4.2 per cent drop in sales, compared to last year. The Centre for Retail Research, which compiled the report by talking to retail chains and shoppers, said websites are attracting customers mainly due to low prices and convenience. Experts also say households are expected to spend a record average of £775 on Christmas this year, up £17 from 2013. That includes an average spend of £459 on gifts, while £216 is expected to be spent on food and drink. Each household will spend £77 on travel and £23 on decorations. Meanwhile, the British Retail Consortium said shoppers had 'held back' on autumn spending in order to splash out over Christmas. The BRC said  non-food retail sales for the past three months had grown by 2.8 per cent, compared to 3.5 per cent last year. A spokesman said: 'Sales data suggests many people have held back on spending ahead of Christmas, economising to leave room for a little luxury during the Christmas period.' Scenes at Oxford Street last year. Credit card companies and retailers expect even more money to be spent this year as festive spending hits £74bn .

John Lewis' fashion sales fell 13 per cent year-on-year earlier in autumn. Professor Joshua Bamfield, director of the Centre for Retail Research, said: 'Christmas period year-on-year sales growth is good - and much better than a year ago. 'Consumer confidence has grown steadily since 2013. But recent months' growth have been below peak mid-year growth partly due to the long summer keeping shoppers away from stores.' He added: 'Online's proportion of sales will increase. Websites often provide a greater variety of goods than a high street store, with cheaper prices and more convenience for customers. 'This is particularly true for casual customers buying electronic goods and tablets for Christmas.'","British shoppers will spend £6,000 every second this Black Friday .

"Long before Cara and her power brows took the modelling world by storm, there was another member of the Delevingne clan rocking the catwalk. Poppy, 28, began modelling in 2008 after being spotted by the same model scout as sister Cara and has since worked for  Burberry, Louis Vuitton and Mango, among others. Now, the Chanel brand ambassador has used her fashion expertise to design a range of swimwear - and has modelled everything herself. Scroll down for video . Designer: Poppy Delevingne shot to fame as a model but now she has turned swimwear designer . Poppy has teamed up with swimwear label Solid & Striped to create the preppy range of bikinis and swimming costumes. Poppy, who is also 'Young Ambassador' for the British Fashion Council, was already a  fan of the brand and wore the designs during her Popchella hen weekend at the Coachella festival. Speaking to Style.com about her efforts, which are being sold through Net-a-Porter, she said: 'I was instantly drawn to the suits because they were sexy and fun and you didn't feel uncomfortable in them. 'I could run around and do cartwheels in them!' The pieces are, said the model, designed to reflect her 'active' lifestyle and come with fun prints, among them flamingo motifs, and bold block colours. Activewear: Poppy, who has a busy schedule, says she wanted her designs to reflect that and cater to active women . Lithe: Poppy was spotted back in 2008 and has built a huge name for herself in the modelling world ever since, so it was only a matter of time before she turned to designing . Collaboration: The newlywed's range for Solid & Striped came off the back of her wearing and loving the range . Something for everyone: As well as skimpy bikinis, there's also plenty of more modest swimsuits in the new range, which is available on Net-a-Porter . 'I have an active schedule and life - this is for the active girl,' she added. It has certainly been an active few weeks for the model and muse, who put in a stylish appearance at the Museum of Modern Art's 2014 Film Benefit honouring director Alfonso Cuaron on Monday. Dressed in a colourful Chanel dress, the model ensured that all eyes were on her as she arrived at the New York event. But one man who wasn't there to witness her dramatic dress sense was Poppy's husband James Cook, who remained behind in London. The pair married six months ago in a lavish two-part wedding, which began in the British capital and continued in the Moroccan city of Marrakech. Cara, who? Her little sister is focusing more on her acting career in the New Year and it looks like Poppy is getting ready to take her place in the fashion world . Fun prints: Poppy wanted the designs to reflect her personality and lifestyle so opted for colourful prints such as this flamingo one .

"A hero Marine who was left paralyzed by a sniper's bullet in Afghanistan defied the odds and  walked again using robotic leg braces in a moving ceremony at Camp Pendleton. Captain Derek Herrera saluted proudly as he took part in the ceremony in California, where he was awarded the much coveted Bronze Star. The special operations officer was given the award for his actions on June 14, 2012, when the patrol he was leading came under heavy fire in Afghanistan. Scroll down for video . Honor: U.S. Marine Captain Derek Herrera, center, 1st Marine Special Operations Battalion, salutes during his awards and retirement ceremony at Camp Pendleton, California on November 21 . Decorated: Herrera, proudly wore his Bronze Star during his retirement ceremony in California . Despite being wounded, brave Herrera continued coordinating efforts while receiving treatment for his own spinal injury and collapsed left lung. On Friday, he was watched by a crowd of 300 Marines who fell silent as the Captain received the honor and all that could be heard was the faint whirring of electric motors from the device. Herrera stood, holding onto one crutch. With his other hand, he saluted his commanding officer, who presented him with the award. Lieutenant Colonel John J. Lynch, commanding officer of the Marine Corps Special Operations Command, said: 'Your drive and determination are great and you will continue to do great things.' In a show of grit and determination, Herrera had vowed to walk at the event that also marked his retirement after 8 and a half years in the military. He said he wanted to leave the Marine Corps the same way he joined and has gone from fighting on the battlefield to becoming a strong advocate for veterans. 'I'm not out of the fight and I'll continue on,' he told his battalion, adding that it was 'truly an honor and a pleasure to stand before you today.' Bronze star: Herrera, center, looks reflective as he is awarded a Bronze Star at Camp Pendleton . Speech: Herrera spoke movingly during his awards and retirement ceremony at Camp Pendleton . Robotic legs: Herrera, center, was left paralyzed by a sniper's bullet in Afghanistan but walked again using robotic leg braces at the ceremony, where he was awarded a Bronze Star . He was recommended for the accolade by Major Gen. M.A. Clark. He wrote: 'The bravery and fortitude he displayed inspired his men to heroic feats as they valiantly fought to save the lives of their wounded team members and repel the enemy assault. Left paralyzed from the chest down, the 30-year-old Marine sought to be allowed to remain on active duty and has pushed himself to get back to walking. His last day on active-duty is November 30. Paralyzed:  Herrera is pictured here on the road to recovery, he wanted to remain on active duty after a sniper's bullet in Afghanistan left him paralyzed two years ago but soon decided to retire . Herrera was the first person in the United States to purchase the ReWalk system recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, according to the company, ReWalk Robotics Ltd. The ReWalk is a robotic exoskeleton system that allows people with spinal cord injuries to stand and walk. Several competing products that use the technology — nicknamed 'electronic legs' or 'powered exoskeletons' — are also being used and tested in U.S. rehab hospitals. None so far are fast enough to entirely replace wheelchairs. Support: Herrera is pictured here with his wife, he vowed to retire while standing . ReWalk was cleared by the FDA for personal use, although it has been on the market outside the United States since 2012. The device consists of leg braces with motion sensors and motorized joints that respond to subtle changes in upper-body movement and shifts in balance. A supportive belt around the patient's waist keeps the suit in place, and a backpack holds the computer and rechargeable battery. Marines: The special operations officer, center, was the first American to purchase the ReWalk system recently approved by the Federal Drug Administration . Crutches are used for stability, and the FDA requires an assistant be nearby. Herrera's wife assists him. The MARSOC Foundation, a charitable fund for members of the Marine Corps Special Operations Command, raised the money for Herrera to buy the $69,500 device. Today, Herrera is working on a master's degree in business administration at the University of California, Los Angeles and plans to start his own business. 'Every day is a choice to live, love, inspire, honor the fallen, make the world a better place and walk in the footsteps of giants,' Herrera wrote in a column for UT San Diego in 2013.","Captain Derek Herrera saluted as he took part in the ceremony in California .

"A British scientist suffered serious hand and face injuries when a Taliban booby-trap bomb exploded inside a top-security laboratory in Afghanistan. Military police are investigating why the device wasn’t detected by stringent security checks it should have gone through before it was given to the expert to examine. The scientist, having been assured the device was safe, was not wearing protective equipment. But it blew up in his hand. SERIOUS ERROR: A Taliban booby-trap bomb went off at Kandahar airfield, above, causing the British scientist who was handling it to suffer serious hand and face injuries . The incident happened at Kandahar airfield last December but has only just been confirmed by the Ministry of Defence. The Mail on Sunday understands that the device, which may have been hidden inside a mobile phone case, was picked up by a British soldier after a battle in southern Afghanistan. It should have been thoroughly tested and given the all-clear before being passed to the scientist, who was responsible for gathering forensic evidence. The MoS further understands that, had it not detonated in the lab, the device may have been put on a plane back to UK – for further testing here. A mid-air explosion aboard a military aircraft could have killed many British personnel. The scientist lost several fingers in the blast and his face was severely burned. He was the only casualty and received emergency first aid at the scene before being driven to a military hospital. He has since returned to Britain and is receiving further treatment for his injuries. The scientist has also been questioned as part of the Royal Military Police (RMP) investigation into the incident but he is not believed to be in any way responsible for the blast. CONFLICT: The explosive device was found after British troops clashed with the Taliban . Because the inquiry is being carried out by the RMP, its conclusions will not be made public. But last night the Shadow Defence Secretary demanded that Parliament be given a full explanation. Vernon Coaker MP said: ‘There is no civilian scrutiny of these procedures and therefore the Ministry of Defence must work doubly hard to ensure public confidence. The Government should also explain why this incident was not made public before now, as the details will cause shock and concern. ‘This incident resulted in tragic circumstances for the scientist involved but, had this device been in transit to the UK, the situation could have been much worse.’ The scientist was working for the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), an agency of the MoD which is responsible for providing scientific research to support military operations. His injuries are understood to have prevented him from returning to work and, following the RMP probe, he is expected to be offered a financial settlement by the MoD. The DSTL provided scientific advisers to work alongside British forces throughout the campaign against the Taliban in Afghanistan where they advised commanders on the technology used by the enemy to make roadside bombs. The incident is believed to be the only example of a Taliban booby-trapped device detonating inside a British base. DSTL confirmed the incident. A spokesman said: ‘We recognise the invaluable contribution of all our people and are committed to supporting anyone injured through their employment with us. An investigation into this incident continues.’","Military police are investigating why the device wasn't detected sooner .

The feature is being added as part of an update to the hotel’s existing Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) app. This app is already available for iOS and Android devices. It lets guests browse and book rooms, learn more about the hotels, see photos and receive exclusive offers. If the trials are successful, Starwood Hotels and Resorts said it plans to add the feature to the rest of its 123 hotels by the end of 2015. The scheme is being trialled at Starwood's Aloft Hotels in Manhattan, pictured, and Silicon Valley. If the trials are successful, the U.S-based firm said it plans to add the feature to the rest of its 123 hotels worldwide by the end of 2015 . The SPG app, pictured, is available for iOS and Android devices and lets guests browse and book rooms, plus receive exclusive offers . Starwood’s CEO Frits Van Paasschen told the Wall Street Journal: ‘It may be a novelty at first, but we think it will become table stakes for managing a hotel. ‘We believe this will become the new standard for how people will want to enter a hotel.’ As a precursor to the digital keys, Starwood launched its keycard-by-post scheme in 2010. Under this scheme, loyalty club members in the U.S. are sent a keycard that can be used time and time again, once they have spent at least one night at any of the Starwood hotels. The keycard is only activated on the first day of each stay. Marriott hotels recently introduced online check-in to loyalty program members at 350 of its flagship resorts. However, once the guests arrive at the hotel, they still need to collect a room key - albeit from a separate reception desk.","Starwood Hotels and Resorts is planning to launch the feature in its hotels .

"An immigrant who suffered a stroke in a New Jersey hospital has woken up from a coma in Poland after being carted 'like a sack of potatoes' to his homeland while unconscious. Wladyslaw Haniszewski is receiving treatment at a hospital in the town of Boleslawiec, despite having lived in the U.S. for the past 30 years. Polish officials are furious after Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick deported the 69-year-old, who had been living in America illegally, because he had no medical insurance. Meanwhile, the Boleslawiec hospital claims Mr Haniszewski also lacks health insurance in Poland and his care is costing the medical facility 'a few hundred dollars' a day. Its director said the patient was 'dumped on the doorstep' before they had even agreed to the transfer. Patient: Wladyslaw Haniszewski, pictured, woke up from a coma in Poland after losing consciousness in New Jersey . Poor treatment: Wladyslaw Haniszewski, 69, whose arm is pictured, is receiving treatment at a hospital in Poland, after he was sent to his home country after almost three decades in the U.S. Deported: Mr Haniszewski was deported from Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in the US after it was discovered he was living in America illegally and had no medical insurance . Polish . Consul General, Ewa Junczyk-Ziomecka, said she and other diplomats were . trying to help Mr Haniszewski, after the hospital suddenly shipped him . overseas without informing his friends or family. They learned only last week that he was gone, Ms Junczyk-Ziomecka told the New York Daily News. 'Imagine being carted around like a sack of potatoes,' she said. Mr . Haniszewski is awake but unable to speak with doctors, the consul said. 'He can smile from time to time, but he is unable to communicate,' she . added. The 69-year-old suffers from a blood disease and lived for . many years in Perth Amboy, near Staten Island in New Jersey. He had lost his job in recent years, which, in turn, saw him lose his apartment. When he became sick, he was living in a local shelter, according to his friend, Jerzy Jedra. 'This is a very good man who I saw on a daily basis for some 12 years,' Mr Jedra told the Daily News. Mr Jedra took Mr Haniszewski to the New Brunswick hospital earlier this month and it was while he was in hospital that he suffered the stroke. Polish hospital: Mr Haniszewski is now in a hospital, pictured, in the Polish town of Boleslawiec . No sign off: Family and Friends say they knew nothing of the man's deportation until later and the Polish hospital, pictured, said he wasn't in a fit state to agree to it himself . U.S. hospitals are legally bound to give emergency care to all, but can ship 'undocumented patients' back to their homeland through a process called 'medical repatriation.' In order to do so the patient must be 'stabilized,' which is not the equivalent of 'stable condition.' In many cases, the patient has an ongoing critical illness. The hospital must also get consent either from the patient, family or a court guardian. In . Mr Haniszewski’s case — first reported in the Polish-language paper . Nowy Dziennik — consular officials say this did not happen. 'It's an . incredibly disturbing case,' Lori Nessel, director of the Centre . for Social Justice at Seton Hall University School of Law told the Daily News. Medical repatriation is a practice by which U.S. hospitals deport critically ill or injured immigrant patients to, often inferior, hospitals in their home country. In many cases, the immigrant has been living in America for years, if not decades. In order to send them home, the hospital is required to get consent either from the patient, family or a court guardian. However, as in Mr Haniszewski's case, this doesn't always happen. Deportations are often carried out without the consent or knowledge of the courts. The hospitals generally use private planes and ambulances to carry the sick, who are often too ill, or scared, to object. The Center for Social Justice at Seton Hall Law School and New York Lawyers for the Public Interest recently revealed that more than 800 immigrants have been medically repatriation, or the hospital has at least tried to deport them, across the United States since 2006. Hospitals are only required to care for the sick immigrant until the patient is 'stabilized.' This is not equivalent to 'stable condition.' As such, many hospitals transfer patients in critical condition to free up beds and save money. But the immigrant generally ends up in an inferior hospital in their home country, putting their health at risk. With the standard procedure for deportation known as an order of removal, immigrants retain the right to appeal their ousting to the courts. But, with medical repatriation, patients have no recourse. 'This kind of action seems clearly illegal and . also not ethical, but it's hard to bring a legal action.' A . spokesman for the hospital . said it had followed proper procedures — but refused to discuss the specific . details of the case. 'The individual was informed regarding his . discharge plan and care. As the hospital's understanding of the facts . differs from the published reports, we are conducting a thorough review . of the procedures and communications surrounding this gentleman's care,' said the spokesman. He said the hospital only repatriates patients if . they are satisfied a health care provider in the patient's home country . will provide treatment. U.S. Immigration and Customs plays no role in . medical repatriations, which are paid for by hospitals themselves as way . of ridding themselves patients that need costly, long term care. The Centre for Social Justice says U.S. hospitals from at least 15 States have sent or attempted to send more . than 800 immigrants back home since 2006. Hospitals generally use private planes and ambulances to carry the sick who are often too ill to object. Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital reportedly transported Mr Haniszewski to Boleslawiec using a specially hired Air Escort Medical Flight and ambulance, after tracing his last known address to the town. Air Escort said such a flight could cost anywhere from $5,000 to $100,000 depending on the number of personel and the type of equipment needed. The Boleslawiec hospital has confirmed the 69-year-old was not in a fit state to sign off on the transfer. Its deputy director, Nikolaj Lambrinow, told a local TV station that the U.S. hospital had contacted him regarding the transfer but before he agreed Mr Haniszewski was dumped on their doorstep. 'His status in Poland is the same as in the United States. He is a Polish citizen without an address, without certification, pension and insurance,' Lambrinow told TVN. He said that his care at the hospital is costing a few hundred dollars a day. Officials are trying to find out from the New Brunswick hospital the legal basis for sending the patient back to Poland. 'Behind our backs they transported the unconscious man to Poland,' Ewa Junczyk-Ziomecka told TVN. 'I cannot imagine such a situation that the decision about transporting an unconscious person could be made without agreement. Between the two institutions must be a contract, there must be documents. You cannot simply leave a patient at the door and drive away,' she said. In another example of medical repatriation, the . Adventist La Grange Memorial Hospital last year obtained legal . permission to deport Chicago resident Barbara Latasiewicz to Poland . after she suffered a stroke in 2009 that left her paralysed. Flight: The hospital reportedly transported Mr Haniszewski to Boleslawiec using a specially hired Air Escort Medical Flight, though sometimes they use commercial flights, like that pictured . The cleaner . had originally come to the US in 1990 but stayed on after her original . visa expired. She became paralysed as a result of the stroke and . required 24-hour care. The hospital asked around 30 other U.S. medical . facilities to take her in, but their request was denied each time. The hospital continued to treat her for two years despite her lack of medical insurance at a cost of $1million (£650,000). Eventually . the hospital applied to the courts to force her to return to Poland, a . country she had not seen for 22 years, leaving her son and grandchildren . in the U.S.. 'It's hard to document how often it happens because it . happens in the shadows,' said Shena Elrington, director of the Health . Justice Program told the Daily News. 'We have been doing some outreach to consulates and are hearing that it happens with increasing frequency.' Advocates . fear repatriations will become more common from 2014, when the US . government, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, begins . to reduce payments to hospitals that care for a disproportionate number . of the uninsured.","Wladyslaw Haniszewsk was sent to Poland after living in US for 30 years .

"David Owen has accused Tony Blair and David Cameron of striking a secret deal to prevent the Chilcot Inquiry publishing key documents about the Iraq war. The former Foreign Secretary said extracts of letters between Mr Blair and President George W Bush have been held back to save the ex-Prime Minister’s reputation. It is believed the documents may shed light on the allegation that Mr Blair had already agreed to go to war up to a year before the 2003 invasion. Accusations: David Owen has accused Tony Blair and David Cameron of striking a secret deal to prevent the Chilcot Inquiry publishing key documents about the Iraq war. In a speech, Lord Owen made the  astonishing claim that Mr Cameron had backed Mr Blair’s decision to block the publication of the letters in return for his ‘neutrality or tacit support’ at the next general election. The peer also pointed the finger of blame at Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, accusing him too of blocking the publication of the documents. The Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq conflict was set up four years ago but has yet to report. While Sir John Chilcot and his panel have been given access to all the documents, they have been denied the right to publish some of those which they regard as key to their conclusions. In a speech at the 'How the light gets in' literary festival in Hay last week, Lord Owen said: ‘It is almost beyond belief that the inquiry is being prevented from revealing extracts that they believe relevant from exchanges between President Bush and Prime Minister Blair. ‘By whom is the inquiry being prevented from printing those extracts? We are told by the  Cabinet Secretary. That is like a rerun of Yes Prime Minister. ‘Publication of the Bush extracts would not be blocked if Tony Blair had not objected, nor if that  objection had not been supported by the present Prime Minister, David Cameron. Claims: Former Foreign Secretary David Owen, pictured, said extracts of letters between Mr Blair and President George W Bush have been held back to save the ex-Prime Minister's reputation . ‘Both men are hiding behind conventions that are totally inappropriate given the nature of the inquiry.’ He then levelled an extraordinary charge – denied by both the Blair and Cameron camps – that the two leaders had struck a private deal. Lord Owen said: ‘No 10 reveals that they are in constant contact on many issues with Tony Blair and Blair’s own people confirm this. Not for nothing does Cameron see himself still as the “heir to Blair”. ‘It is hard to escape the conclusion that No 10 hopes to … win the neutrality or possibly tacit support of Blair by the general election.’ Lord Owen pointed out that elements of Mr Blair’s communications with Mr Bush have already been revealed by the former Prime Minister ‘and his close associates’ in their memoirs, which were also approved by past Cabinet Secretaries. Sir Jeremy’s predecessor, Sir Gus O’Donnell, has informed the inquiry that it cannot publish the Bush-Blair letters because they represented ‘particularly privileged channels of communication’, the exposure of which would ‘prejudice the UK’s relations with the US’. But Lord Owen said that was not acceptable: ‘The conventions and Freedom of Information Act covering such conversations were never intended to be used to block a major inquiry held into a political and military fiasco of a dimension we have not seen since the Dardanelles in the First World War.’ Lord Owen, who has written a book accusing Mr Blair of ‘hubristic lying’ over his role in the war, said: ‘Clarifying whether Parliament was lied to will be a test of nerve for the Chilcot Report. ‘It will not be sufficient to duck out and let its readers determine who, if anyone, lied. ‘We all recognise there are different types of lies. White lies, grey lies, sexual lies, necessary lies. ‘Yet there are black lies, lies that debauch the standards of public life and they must be treated with the utmost seriousness. Many believe politics is the art of lying. If lies are allowed to become the currency of political debate on the floor of the House of Commons then our democracy is gravely endangered.’ Attack: A petrol bomb hits a British soldier in Basra in 2005. The soldier survived . Both Mr Blair’s office and Downing Street vociferously denied that they had struck any kind of deal over the documents. A spokesman for Mr Blair said: ‘This is categorically untrue and completely absurd. The inquiry has had unprecedented access to all relevant government papers throughout, including these ones.’ A Downing Street spokesman called the claims of collusion ‘total nonsense’. ‘The idea of any kind of deal is categorically untrue,’ he added. But the Cabinet Office admitted that while all the documents had been shown to the inquiry team, permission to publish letters between Mr Blair and Mr Bush had been rejected. A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘Any suggestion that the Government is attempting to influence the work of the inquiry is wrong. ‘At the outset the Government assured the inquiry of its full cooperation. It continues to fully support the inquiry.’ A senior source said Sir John had ‘yet to begin’ a dialogue with the Cabinet Office about some unresolved issues, including the Bush-Blair notes.","David Owen  said extracts of letters between Mr .

"Hopes that Libya's new democratic regime would agree to re-open the investigation into the Lockerbie bombing have been dashed after officials declared that the case was 'over'. However, Britain tonight insisted that the probe into the terrorist atrocity that killed 270 people in 1988 remains open. The Foreign Office disclosed that members of the Lockerbie investigation team, including officers from Dumfries and Galloway Police, had visited the north African state this week to look into possible leads which could result in further convictions for the attack. But Libyan authorities now say they do not want to 'dig into the past' amid fears they could be forced to pay out further compensation to the families of the victims. Atrocity: The remains of Pan Am flight 103, brought down over Lockerbie, Scotland, in a 1988 terrorist attack . Destruction: The scene in the village of Lockerbie, where houses were destroyed by the plane . In a statement tonight, the Foreign Office said that it expected a follow-up to the investigation team’s visit 'very soon'. 'The Lockerbie investigation team, including Dumfries and Galloway Police, were able to visit Tripoli earlier this week, after the Government helped to secure visas for them,' the statement said. 'They held initial discussions with Libyan ministers and senior officials on future cooperation on the Lockerbie case and we expect to see follow-up on this visit very soon. 'The investigation into the Lockerbie case remains open and the Government continues to discuss cooperation on this case with the Libyan government.' The country's dictator Muammar Gaddafi had long been suspected of ordering the attack on Pan Am flight 103 from London to New York, but Libya did not admit responsibility for the killings until 2003. That year, Gaddafi apologised for the bombing and agreed to pay out $2.2billion (£1.4billion) in compensation in return for the lifting of UN sanctions. Abdelbaset Al Megrahi was convicted of involvement with the attack in 2001, though he was released from prison on compassionate grounds and died last year. British and American officials have never believed that Megrahi, who always proclaimed his innocence, acted alone and have long been keen to get their hands on the Libran intelligence chiefs whom they hold responsible for the bombing. Culprit: Abdelbaset Al Megrahi, pictured with Said Gaddafi on his return to Libya in 2009, is the only person who has ever been convicted over the bombing . The fall of Gaddafi's regime in 2011 raised the prospect that the bombers could finally be brought to justice - officers from Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary have visited Tripoli to try and investigate the case afresh. But senior officials from Libya's new democratic government are reluctant to re-open old wounds by looking into the historic atrocity once more, according to the Daily Telegraph. 'The matter was settled with the Gaddafi regime,' justice minister Salah Al Marghani said. 'I am trying to work on the current situation rather than dig into the past.' His deputy Hameda Al Magery added: 'Britain and America are asking us to reopen this file. But this is something of the past. This is over. We want to move forward to build a new future and not to look back at Gaddafi's black history.' Confession: Dictator Muammar Gaddafi admitted in 2003 that Libya was responsible for the attack . Revolution: A crowd in Tripoli this week celebrating protests which led to Gaddafi's downfall . It is believed that one reason the government is unwilling to re-open the Lockerbie investigation is that it is worried the families of the victims, who were mostly from the UK and U.S., might demand further compensation. An anonymous official told the Telegraph: 'We know they want more money from Libya and that is why we are being very careful.' If Libyan authorities did agree to investigate the case again they could face a backlash from within the country - Gaddafi's decision to pay out in 2003 sparked massive street protests. British police are particularly anxious to talk to Abdullah Senussi, a former head of Libyan intelligence who is currently being held in prison in Tripoli, but they are considered unlikely to be granted access to him. Gaddafi's downfall after 42 years in power was welcomed by Western leaders as a landmark moment in the Arab Spring, but Libya's transition to democracy has sometimes been troubled. A particularly black moment came in September last year, when terrorists over-ran the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, killing ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.","Officials from new regime reject calls to hunt down remaining suspects .

"UKIP candidate Anna-Marie Crampton is alleged to have said World War Two was engineered by Zionists and bankers to create the state of Israel . The UK Independence Party today suffered a string of damaging revelations about its election candidates, including one who reportedly claimed Jews murdered each other in the Holocaust. UKIP leader Nigel Farage was forced to admit the party had not properly checked all 1,700 candidates it is fielding in next week’s council elections, raising the prospect of more embarrassments to come. The row threatens to undermine the party’s hopes of making a major breakthrough in May 2’s elections. Anna-Marie Crampton, a UKIP candidate in East Sussex, was suspended by the party over reports she posted extreme views on a conspiracy theorist website called 'Secrets of The Fed'. Crampton, 57, is allegedly quoted as saying: ’Holocaust means a sacrifice by fire. Only the Zionists could sacrifice their own in the gas chambers. ’The Second World Wide War was engineered by the Zionist jews and financed by the bankers to make the general public all over the world to feel so guilty and outraged by the Holocaust that a treaty would be signed to create the State of Israel as we know it today.’ Just two weeks ago Mrs Crampton posed with Mr Farage at a rally in Tunbridge Wells, Kent. A spokesman said: ’These comments are really way out there and really hard-core anti-Zionism.’ A spokesman for British Influence, which is campaigning against UKIP policies on Europe said: ’This sort of holocaust denial from a UKIP candidate is further evidence of the toxic mix of anti-semitism and cuckoo conspiracy theories that run rife in UKIP and she should be expelled from the party and not simply suspended. ’The fact is that UKIP has more than . 1,700 candidates being fielded in next Thursday's local elections  - almost as many as the Lib Dems – and one has to ask oneself how many more of . them have skeletons in the cupboard.’ Anti-Zionist comments made from the Facebook account of Anna-Marie Crampton. She was later suspended . Anna-Marie Crampton pictured left with UKIP leader Nigel Farage at a rally in Tunbridge Wells, Kent. Mr Farage admitted that not all candidates have been properly vetted to ensure they do not hold extreme views . Yesterday, Susan Bowen, from Boscastle in Cornwall, was dropped as a candidate in elections to the county’s unitary council after it emerged she was once a member of the BNP. In county council elections UKIP is fielding more candidates than the Lib Dems. But the dramatic election push could come at a cost, after Mr Farage admitted that not all of them have been properly vetted to ensure they do not hold extreme views. He said that a ’rigorous testing procedure’ was in place to choose candidates for next years’s elections to the European Parliament, and the 2015 general election. This tested ’people’s knowledge, their ability with media - you know, full credit checks, police checks and all the rest of it’. But he told BBC Radio 4’s World at One: ’I’ll be honest with you, we don’t have the party apparatus in a very short space of time to fully vet 1,700 people. ’We have made people sign declaration forms, expressing the fact that they’ve never been part of political parties that we consider to be wholly undesirable. By that I mean the BNP. ’And, you know, we ask people if there is a problem with a criminal record or whatever else it may be, please tell us. ’I have no doubt that amongst those 1,700 one or two people will have slipped through the net that we’d rather not have had.’ Mr Farage has previously criticised Tory leader David Cameron for his 2006 claim that ’Ukip is sort of a bunch of ... fruit cakes and loonies and closet racists mostly’.","Anna-Marie Crampton, a UKIP candidate in .

"Passengers on an aircraft flying out of JFK had to deal with the scariest of sights just after take off. The cabin of a Delta Airlines plane began to fill with smoke as the aircraft began its climb on one of the hottest days of the year. Soon afterwards, the plane began to shake violently as it encountered turbulence. Passengers were told to stay in their seats, but it didn't stop some travelers from taking pictures of the troubling sight. Glow sticks required: Smoke began to fill the cabin of this Delta Airlines plane and it didn't dissipate until the aircraft had reached cruising altitude . One Reddit user Ficcolo posted the picture stating: 'Last night flying out of JFK....this happened and freaked us out. Disco rave flight!' The fog in the cabin began to appear whilst the aircraft was on the ground and remained until the plane had reached cruising altitude. Once the plane hit rough air on an otherwise clear summers evening, the worry that some passengers felt can be seen from the picture Ficcolo snapped. Feeling their concern, the Captain decided to offer the entire planeload of passengers free alcoholic drinks. The airline normally charges up to $7 for such luxuries. 'I was grateful for my tiny bottles of vodka and juice. Worst turbulence ever after such a long Tarmac stay and fogging,' Ficcolo wrote. Smoke on a plane: The fog seemed to form on takeoff from JFK on one of the hottest days of the year . Although the fog in the cabin appeared to rise up to the chest level of many passengers, it became apparent that it was due to the hot 90 degree weather New York has been experiencing, coupled with an air conditioning system malfunction. However, basic science is able to explain the appearance of the fog in the cabin: hot humid air outside mixing with cool conditioned air from inside the plane, and the mist begins to form. As the plane takes off, the air pressure in the cabin decreases. The temperature of the air also decreases and if it is rapid enough the air will cool enough for the water in the air to condense instantaneously, forming the fog that the passengers witnessed. Nothing dangerous, but still unnerving when flying at 35,000 ft.","Cabin of a Delta Airlines flight began to fill with fog soon after takeoff .

"When Jewish schoolgirl Helga Weiss was ordered off the train at Auschwitz in 1944, she was destined for death in the gas chambers - along with all the others considered too young or too old to work. But instead of being killed, Helga, not long in her teens, managed to convince 'Angel of Death' doctor Josef Mengele she was older and fit to work. Almost 70 years after she gave one of the most reviled Nazis the slip, the story of the Czech teenager - now a celebrated artist - . is to be told for the first time in a new book. Helga Weiss, pictured here during the war, was given hard labour instead of being gassed at Auschwitz after convincing Josef Mengele - the 'Angel of Death' - that she was 'fit to work' Helga Weissova-Hoskova, as she is now known, went on to become a famous artist in the Czech Republic . Mengele would hold the power of life and death over the Jews sent to the camp - sending the weakest off to the left and unwittingly into the gas chambers where they would meet their end. The strongest would go to the right for forced labour but survival. Although the other children were killed, Helga was spared by the SS officer, who sent her to a work camp. His snap decision saved her life, and at the end of the war she was freed. Miss Weiss, who went on to become a . famous artist in the Czech Republic, and is now in her 80s, will have her war memoirs . published around the world. She kept a diary jotted down in school . exercise books of her time spent in concentration camps during the war. Death camp: The main entrance to Auschwitz. Schoolgirl Helga Weiss managed to persuade Mengele to save her. The writing over the gate 'Arbeit macht frei' says 'work sets you free' As prisoners arrived at Auschwitz, notorious doctor Josef Mengele (pictured) would sort them - ushering the strongest to the right and the weakest to the left to their deaths. Those who were not fit for work - because they were not physically fit, were too young or too old - were sent to the gas chambers immediately. Historians have told harrowing stories of how he sentenced a block of 750 people to death when he discovered there was an outbreak of lice in their block. But although Mengele had the power of life and death over all the new arrivals, it was his grim experiments that gave him notoriety. He would amputate limbs, sterilise prisoners and give them shock therapy. Those who didn't die during surgery would be killed by infection or put to death. The sheer barbarity of his actions has made him one of the most infamous characters in Nazi Germany. But when the Third Reich fell in 1945 he escaped to South America and lived on until 1979. The book, Helga's Diary - sold to publishers at the Frankfurt book fair - has been likened to the diary of Anne Frank. It will come out in Britain next year. After persuading the death camp officer to save her, Miss Weiss moved back to her home city of Prague after the war. Although she found fame with her artwork, her war diaries were little known. Helga was sent to live in a ghetto by the Nazis in Terezin, Czechoslovakia, at the start of the diary which begins in 1939. She tells the story of her grim life - and how freedom was gradually curtailed before she was shipped off to Auschwitz with her mother in 1944. Helga - who is now married and uses the surname Weissova-Hoskova - told the Observer during a visit to London last year that life under the Nazis got progressively worse before she was shipped off to the death camp. 'One thing after another was forbidden: employees lost their jobs, we were banned from the parks, swimming pools, sports clubs. 'I was banned from going to school when I was 10,' she said. 'I was always asking my parents, ""What's happening?"", and became angry at them if I thought they were trying to hide something, to protect me.' She arrived at Auschwitz on October 4, 1944, where Dr Mengele was deciding who to kill and who should be given labour. After tricking the reviled doctor into thinking she was old enough to work, Helga was sent to Flossenbürg where she was forced to work. Of around 15,000 children from Terezin sent to Auschwitz, it is believe between 150 and 1,500 survived. Although Helga has admitted in the past that she kept a war journal, it had never been published before. Helga's Diary (published by Viking) is out on June 7 next year.

"A girl thrown from a plane that crashed at San Francisco International Airport died before she was twice run over by fire trucks, according to a report issued by the city. It directly contradicts a coroner's finding that the teen survived the crash and was killed by the fire vehicles. Instead, the city said in a report obtained Wednesday that 16-year-old Ye Meng Yuan died when she hit the ground after she was thrown from the back of an Asiana jet that had its tail ripped off. Killed: Ye Meng Yuan, left, 16, was hit by at least oner fire truck after the Asiana plane crash. She died along with her schoolfriend Wang Linjia, right . The conclusion was contained in a report the city filed with the National Transportation Safety Board. City officials say it is based on NTSB reports and interviews by federal investigators; the city did not conduct an autopsy or consult with medical experts. ‘We did our examination and we determined that the young lady was alive when she was struck by the fire trucks,’ said San Mateo County coroner Robert Foucrault. ‘The death certificate says what it says. If someone wants to put a spin on something, they can do that.’ No one disputes that Ye Meng Yuan, 16, was found dead on the ground after being thrown out the back of an Asiana Airlines jet airliner that crashed at San Francisco International Airport last summer. And there's agreement she was hit, twice, by fire trucks rushing to the scene. But a few weeks after the accident, Foucrault announced that the autopsy was complete and that she had been alive when she was hit, saying there was internal hemorrhaging that indicated her heart was still beating when the truck struck her. A dashboard camera aboard a San Francisco Fire Department rig shows crash victim Ye Meng Yuan, in the foreground and partially obscured by foam. The rig ran over Miss Yuan seconds later . Only three of the 307 people aboard . the jet died in the dramatic crash that sent the Boeing 777 tumbling . across the tarmac with its tail torn off. The . conclusion that she did not survive the initial crash was contained in a . report the city filed with the National Transportation Safety Board in . January. City officials say they based their findings solely on NTSB . reports and interviews by federal investigators; the city did not . conduct an autopsy or consult with medical experts. The . city said in its document that neither of two NTSB reports noted dust, . dirt, debris or firefighting foam in Meng Yuan's trachea or lung . tissues. The city also said that NTSB investigators found she had not . buckled her seatbelt for the landing, based on interviews with survivors . and an inspection that found her seatbelt attached and unbuckled. Families of Meng Yuan and the two other victims have filed a claim against the city saying emergency workers were incompetent. Highlighted: A camera aboard 'Rescue Truck 10' shows a firefighter directing the truck around Ye on the ground - 15 minutes later he would run her over . Miss Yuan's body lies covered in foam as firefighters battle to put out the flames from the crashed Asiana Airlines plane on July 6 last year . Their attorney Gretchen Nelson said lawyers reviewed the city's findings about the death ‘and we do not agree.’ The . city's report, prepared by airport and fire department officials, is . one of hundreds of documents the NTSB will review before concluding its . accident investigation. Some . of those NTSB documents describe how after the crash, Meng Yuan was . struck twice by emergency vehicles on the runway — once by a fire rig . spraying foam and again 11 minutes later by a second truck that was . turning around to fetch water. Firefighters . told authorities she appeared to be dead — she was covered with dust, . silent, not moving — so they raced on toward the fire. The NTSB records . included some excerpts from the coroner's report but no information . about when or how the girl died. San . Francisco airport spokesman Doug Yakel said officials with the facility . didn't intend to dispute the coroner's conclusion but had depended . solely on NTSB records to conclude the girl had died when she hit the . ground. Crash landing: An aerial view of an Asiana Airlines Boeing 777 plane is seen after it crashed while landing at San Francisco International Airport in California in July . Best . of friend: Ye Meng Yuan and Yuan Linjia, both 16, died when the Boeing . 777 passenger jet slammed into a seawall while attempting to land . NTSB spokesman . Keith Holloway said agency officials do not put personal information . such as causes of death in their public files, but San Francisco . officials could have looked at the coroner's reports. Aviation . attorney Ron Goldman, whose firm is suing the airline and aircraft . manufacturer on behalf of 14 survivors, said city officials are trying . to avoid hefty payouts and are not going to admit anything in public . records that could later be used against them. ‘The . city has an ax to grind here because their liability could hang in the . balance of whether she was already dead or whether she was alive and . they failed to move her to a safe place,’ Goldman said.David Levine, . a law professor at University of California's Hastings College of the . Law, said the city attorney's document is one party's version of what . happened. The city says two . things, Levine said: The girl was dead when she was run over. And even . if she wasn't dead, it's not the city's fault because things were so . chaotic and dangerous when she was struck that no reasonable jury or . judge could blame the city. ‘If . you believe the city's report, damages are going to be zero,’ Levine . said. ‘If you believe the coroner, the family is entitled to millions.’ Levine . said there's no surprise the city would try to cast the best possible . light on itself and its performance that day and not concede any . liability. From afar, Levine thinks it will be difficult to prove where . the girl's fatal injuries came from — the plane or fire trucks. The . way she died doesn't ease the emotional trauma at the San Francisco . Fire Department, where firefighters were shaken after rescuers drove . over Meng Yuan two times, spokeswoman Mindy Talmadge said Wednesday. ‘It doesn't make it better or worse, really,’ she said. ‘It's just psychologically, it's a difficult thing. Period.’","City report: Girl died when she hit the ground after she was thrown from the back of an Asiana jet .

"Former Vice President Dick Cheney cautioned on Sunday that the next attack on the homeland will be 'far deadlier' than the last one. 'We're in a very dangerous period,' Cheney told the Weekly Standard's Bill Kristol in a video interview released on Sunday. 'I think it's more threatening than the period before 9/11. 'I think 9/11 will turn out to be not nearly as bad as the next mass casualty attack against the United States, which, if and when it comes, will be with something far deadlier than airline tickets and box cutters,' he continued. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . If and when the U.S. is attacked again, it 'will be with something far deadlier than airline tickets and box cutters' former Vice President Dick Cheney said in an interview released on Sunday . Cheney credited the increased odds of an attack to 'the dramatic spread of terrorist organizations' over the last several years and the 'proliferation' of areas where terrorists can find safe haven. All the U.S. had to worry about before 9/11 was Afghanistan, he said. Now the U.S. faces significant threats from terrorist cells in Mali, Nigeria, and all of North Africa up through the middle East to Indonesia. The former George W. Bush administration official acknowledged that 'some of the decisions' his boss made were controversial and still are now, six years later, the administration's methods were effective at 'preventing another mass casualty attack on the U.S.' 'I don't think we have any apologies to make,' Cheney said. 'I think in a similar situation today, I would do exactly the same thing,' he stated. Sorry I'm not sorry: Cheney told Weekly Standard founder Bill Kristol he has no regrets about the way he and George W. Bush's administration aggressively combated terrorist threats . Not citing the sitting president, Barack Obama, by name, Cheney suggested that his unwillingness to engage Middle Eastern countries militarily could prove detrimental to the U.S. and the international community. 'For us to look at that part of the world and think we can hide behind our ocean, everything's fine, that's crazy,' he said. 'You gotta be a fool to believe isolationist strategy is the way to go. 'We have no choice to be involved in that part of the world, and if we're not actively involved, some very bad things are gonna happen,' he added. Cheney also listed a nuclear Iran, cuts to the military and Chinese hackers as worrisome threats to the U.S. 'I think we're entering a period of considerable danger with the United States that relative to other nations is weaker than we oughta be,' he said. 'What we need is strong leadership. We need a president and a Congress who understand the nature of the threat. The retired politician expressed hope that the U.S. 'will rise to the occasion now as we did in the past' during World War I and World War II and warned that it's 'very important that we do so.' 'This is not the time for us to rest on our laurels' or cut defense budget he said, referring to Obama's reduction in the military's size and scope. Cheney did not indicate who he thought would make a good replacement for Obama once he leaves office in early 2017, but he said America needs 'somebody who will step up and remind the world what the United States is capable of and demonstrate the ability and willingness to do that.'","'I think 9/11 will turn out to be not nearly as bad as the next mass casualty attack against the United States,' Cheney said .

"A Christmas tree that might make Charlie Brown think twice is getting kicked to the curb a little early after residents of a Pennsylvania town complained it was too ugly. Reading's spindly 50-foot spruce drew the ire of residents who said it was ruining their holiday spirit. Now a group led by the city council president is raising money to buy and decorate a more impressive replacement. The current tree is topped with a lighted pretzel, a nod to the area's many bakeries. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . That's no tree!: Pennsylvania residents look on during the Christmas the tree lighting but can't help but be disturbed by the tree's lackluster look . Outraged: 'It’s nasty, it’s pathetic and they shouldn't have it here,' resident Martin McNeil told reporters . The puny pine was a last-minute stand-in taken from a city park. The city had planned to get its tree from a farm, but the owner wouldn't let the crews drive on the wet ground when they went to pick it up. Officials are hoping to have a do-over tree lighting ceremony next weekend. 'It’s nasty, it’s pathetic and they shouldn't have it here,' resident Martin McNeil told Fox. McNeil said not even a squirrel would climb in the tree whose leaves have already begun falling. Another angered resident spoke her mind in Spanish with a fiery fervor that could be understood by anyone. A community has raised about $1,000 to pay for a spiffier Christmas pine. They’re looking for a total of $5,000 to pay for the decorations and other expenses. Dying: Leaves of the unpopular Christmas tree in Pennsylvania have already begun falling on the ground .

"They nicknamed her Lusty, the grand old dame of the sea. She was fast in her day, shapely, ever eager to serve. But yesterday, after 32 years as a loyal sweetheart of the Royal Navy, HMS Illustrious sailed slowly into an uncertain future. The long-outdated warship came home to Portsmouth for the last time – an aircraft carrier with no aircraft; a ship without a mission. What they couldn’t take away from one of Britain’s most celebrated warships, however, was her proud history. So there to greet her were bikini-clad sunbathers who took to the water, former sailors who had spent much on their lives on board, families who had cheered when she was hurriedly brought into service in the Falklands three decades ago, and spectators who had come simply to witness the end of an era. Scroll down for video . In the water: Women and men wave to HMS Illustrious from the beach at Old Portsmouth in Hampshire, on her way to Portsmouth Naval Base . Watching on: The Royal Navy's helicopter carrier arrived at Portsmouth Naval Base in Hampshire for the final time ahead of her being retired next month . Watching it arrive: Illustrious was rushed into service for the Falklands War, and has served in areas including Bosnia, Sierra Leone and Lebanon . Final push: Illustrious is the last of the Invincible class of aircraft carriers which included the Ark Royal and Invincible which were introduced into the navy in the 1980s . Hats off: Illustrious' entry into service was brought forward so she could assist in the Falklands War effort in 1982 . On top: Crew members line the deck of HMS Illustrious as she sails into her home port of Portsmouth for the final time . Crew: HMS Illustrious has 1,400 compartments and 15 lifts, and has a top speed in excess of 30 knots . Illustrious is the last survivor of the Royal Navy’s trio of celebrated aircraft carriers, alongside HMS Ark Royal and Invincible. And the question on the lips of those who applauded, waved Union flags or wept yesterday was universal. What now for dear old Lusty? The Ministry of Defence must decide whether to preserve her for the nation she served or send her to her doom in the wake of her sister ships. Both endured the humiliation of being towed to a scrap yard in Turkey to be converted into tin cans and razor blades. It’s a fair guess that nobody who turned out yesterday to pay their respects – not even those bronzed bathers cooling down in the shallows off Portsmouth’s ‘hot rocks’ shingle beach as Illustrious passed by – would wish her such an undignified end. Elsewhere glowing tributes were paid to a warship that had sailed the equivalent of 36 times around the equator, not counting the final few hundred yards under tow into Pompey yesterday. A formal decommissioning ceremony is due to be held later this year, and Vice Admiral Sir Philip Jones, the Navy’s fleet commander, promised that her departure would be marked ‘with all the pride she deserves’. Ideas are now being invited on how best to preserve her legacy. One plan is to turn her into a UK-based floating museum, a proposal for which private bids are being canvassed. Music: The band of The Royal Marines perform next to HMS Illustrious as she sails into her home port of Portsmouth for the final time .

In the air: Two Apache Helicopters perform a fly by as HMS Illustrious sails into her home port of Portsmouth for the final time ahead of being retired next month . Last journey: A Royal Navy handout photograph of HMS Illustrious sailing into its home port for the final time ahead of it being retired . Without enough money from investors, charities or trusts, however, there are fears she could eventually embark on the solemn, 3,500-mile trip to that Turkish graveyard. ‘It’s emotional but the old girl has done a good job and it’s time for her to retire,’ said Tracey Thyer, reunited yesterday with her petty officer husband Russ and rating son Richard as they returned from service on Illustrious. ‘I just hope she’s retained with dignity in the future and not left on the scrapheap.’ Also there yesterday was Warrant Officer Steve Barr, 51, of Fareham, Hants, who spent nearly half his 34-year Navy career on Illustrious. He even delayed his retirement to witness what he called ‘this sad day’. Illustrious is to be replaced in the short term by the ‘younger and more capable’ HMS Ocean – which recently underwent a £65million refit – before the new Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers come into service in 2020.

"Correspondence: Convicted killer Mark David Chapman wrote several chilling letters to his arresting officer . The chilling contents of letters written by John Lennon’s killer have been revealed, showing his deep obsession with ‘Catcher on the Rye’ and his desire to be friends with his arresting officer. In a series of never-before-seen letters obtained by Page Six, Mark David Chapman details to NYPD officer Steve Spiro his deranged mind. He first wrote in 1983 that he ‘wanted to be friends’ with Officer Spiro, and asked if the cop would locate Chapman’s copy of ‘The Catcher in the Rye,’ which he had on him during the murder and was lost during Chapman’s arrest. The letters, which are being sold by Gary Zimet’s Moments in Time, which sells rare or historic documents, are valued at around $75,000. According to Page Six, Chapman sent three typed letters to the NYPD officer. At the end of one, he mused that Mr Spiro was ‘still the best d*** cop in New York City.’ Chapman also eerily said: ‘We were all part of something big, Steve,’ adding that something ‘phenomenal’ was all going to ‘come out.’ In one of his letters, Chapman compared a self-immolating woman in Saigon to his belief in J.D. Salinger’s influential novel, saying that the poems found on her body were her legacy. ‘The Catcher in the Rye’ is my statement,’ Chapman wrote. Scroll down for video . New York's finest: Police direct traffic outside the Dakota the morning after Lennon was shot to death in front of the building; the arresting officer, Steve Spiro, received letters from Chapman . Moment in time: The 'Double Fantasy' album that John Lennon autographed for Mark David Chapman hours before the former postal delivery man shot the singer . The convicted murderer also chillingly told Officer Spiro: ‘Lennon was a phony of the highest degree, but there were others who could – and would- have served the same purpose.’ Mr Spiro, who was the first officer on the scene of the shooting, said that he first thought the shots were fireworks over Central Park. ‘I grabbed the guy, Mark David Chapman,’ Mr Spiro said at the time. ‘I wheeled him around. I’m cuffing him…I turn to my right, and see John Lennon being carried out of the building.’ The two had no more interaction than that. According to a hearing transcript released last August, Chapman, 57, a former security guard from Hawaii, said during an August 22 parole hearing that he's been offered lodging and a farm job by Stanley Thurber in Medina, a village between Rochester and Buffalo. He also said that if he was granted parole, he would ‘probably stay right where I’m at’ – in prison. The convicted killer added: ‘I’m so bonded that I could probably assure you that, if released, I’d probably stay right where I’m at. ‘You know, once you stand on a rock for 20 years and feel the waves on you and you don’t go anywhere because you’re on a rock, you don’t want to move.’ Chapman, who was again denied parole last August, shot Lennon in December 1980 outside the Manhattan apartment building where the former Beatle lived. He was sentenced in 1981 to 20 years to life in prison after pleading guilty to second-degree murder. Speaking about Mr Thuber in the hearing, Chapman told the parole board: 'He's a minister and he's an older fellow and he has a lot of contacts in the area and he has agreed to refurbish his upstairs apartment for me and offered me two jobs.’ Fated meeting: John Lennon signs Mark Chapman's copy of Double Fantasy outside the Dakota Building in 1980, hours before Chapman opened fire on the former Beatle and killed him . Scene of the crime: Lennon lived at the Dakota Apartments on Manhattan's Upper West Side; there is now a plaque commemorating where the musician was shot . He said his wife, Gloria Hiroko . Chapman, met Thurber at a church function and was 'impressed by his deep . commitment to Christ.' After corresponding with Mr Thurber, Chapman . said, they met for the first time on August 20. Young: Chapman was 25 when he murdered Lennon, and is seen in a December 9, 1980 booking photo . During his latest hearing, Chapman remembered Lennon as a 'very cordial and very decent man' who stopped to sign an autograph hours before the murder. 'He was very kind to me,' Chapman said. 'Ironically, very kind and was very patient with me. The limousine was waiting, his wife was waiting in the limousine, and he took his time with me and he got the pen going and he signed my album. He asked me if I needed anything else. I said, no. No, sir and he walked way.' Chapman, who said his motivation for killing Lennon was instant notoriety, also told the parole board he was surprised more celebrities haven't been the targets of violence and said he has thought about someone trying to kill him as a way to gain fame as the person who avenged Lennon. 'To do something like that against another person, it's something that would keep me alive and boost me,' he said. 'That's ludicrous and I'm actually glad that that's not done more. I thought maybe more people would do that and I'm glad that they have not. 'I'm surprised that they have not because this society is just geared toward celebrity like crazy.' Concealed: A day after the 1980 murder, Mark David Chapman, centre, is escorted out of police station with a jacket covering his face and head . Weapon of choice: The .38 calibre handgun used by Mark David Chapman to kill John Lennon, seen on the 25th anniversary of Lennon's death, and stored by the NYPD . Chapman, who has said he considered killing several other celebrities, told the parole board he wanted Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, to know that he felt no anger toward Lennon. 'It wasn't anything against her husband as a person, only as a famous person,' he said. 'If he was less famous than three or four other people on the list, he would not have been shot. And that's the truth.' At his previous hearing, he recalled that he had considered shooting Johnny Carson or Elizabeth Taylor instead, and said again that he chose Lennon because the ex-Beatle was more accessible. He said that his century-old Upper West Side apartment building by Central Park 'wasn't quite as cloistered.' Reaction: Lennon's distraught fans gathered outside his apartment building on December 8, after he was gunned down . Scottish holiday: John Lennon and Yoko Ono, with their children Julian Lennon and Kyoko Cox, on holiday at Durness, in Sutherland, Scotland . Widow's grief: Yoko Ono, centre, pictured in 2005 visiting Strawberry Fields, has requested that Chapman not be granted parole in an email to the New York Department of Corrections . Chapman fired five shots outside the . Dakota apartment house on December 8, 1980, hitting Lennon four times in . front of his wife, Yoko Ono, and others. The . former security guard from Hawaii said that his motivation was instant . notoriety but that he later realized he made a horrible decision for . selfish reasons. 'I felt that by killing John Lennon I . would become somebody and instead of that I became a murderer and . murderers are not somebodies.' -Mark David Chapman . 'I felt that by killing John Lennon I would become somebody and instead of that I became a murderer and murderers are not somebodies,' Chapman told the board two years ago. Ono, 79, had said two years ago that she was trying to be 'practical' in asking that her husband's killer remain behind bars. She said Chapman might be a danger to her, other family members and perhaps even himself. In . a 1992 interview at Attica, Chapman told Barbara Walters that it was . dark when he shot Lennon in the back with a .38-caliber revolver after . he exited a limousine, headed up the walkway to his apartment building . and looked at Chapman. 'I . heard this voice - not an audible voice, an inaudible voice - saying . over and over, `Do it, do it, do it,'' Chapman said. He explained, 'I . thought that by killing him I would acquire his fame.' He has been in protective custody with a good disciplinary record, according to corrections officials. Chapman was denied parole in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2012.

Miracle baby: Graze Elizabeth Anderson was born by the side of Interstate 285 outside Atlanta on Tuesday . Nick and Amy Anderson had their two older daughters in the back when the third announced she was on her way into the world. Police officer Tim Sheffield was responding to a call regarding an accident nearby when he spotted the family on the side of the road and stopped to check. ‘I asked the dad, ‘Are you all broke down?’’ He goes, ‘No, we’re having a baby”,’ Officer Sheffield told TODAY. ‘That baby was coming no matter what. They were both calm. They were troupers.’ ‘And then the baby came out, it just happened quick.

"This is the shocking moment a paramedic looks on with his hands in his pockets as a man collapses and dies right in front of him. CCTV footage shows the moment Carl Cope falls to the ground in agony - but paramedic Matt Geary simply watches on instead of helping the dying man. Despite confessing he had done nothing to help Mr Cope, Geary, 36, escaped a jail term and instead was sentenced for health and safety offences for failing to examine or resuscitate him. Shock: Heartless paramedic Matt Geary (in white shirt) looks on with his hands in his pockets as Carl Cope lies dying in front of him just yards from Walsall Manor Hospital accident and emergency department . Panic: CCTV footage shows security guards rushing to help Mr Cope, as Geary (in white shirt) can clearly be seen with his hands in his pockets refusing to help . Geary and a colleague were called when Mr Cope, 47, dialled 999 after collapsing on a grass verge suffering chest pains close to his home early on 23 June 2012. Paramedic Geary − who was responsible for determining the course of treatment for Mr Cope − then took him to Walsall Manor Hospital accident and emergency department. Footage from the hospital waiting room shows Mr Cope struggling to make himself comfortable and visibly in a lot of pain. After seven minutes, he leaves to visit a nearby shop to get a drink. But on his way back through the car park shortly after 11.13am, Mr Cope is seen collapsing close to the hospital doors. Geary can clearly be seen watching from the ambulance as Mr Cope remains on the ground for more than 30 seconds. Struggling to his feet, Mr Cope only manages a few steps before fatally collapsing for a second - and final - time. Tragedy: Carl Cope (left) died in agony as paramedic Matt Geary (right) looked on outside Walsall Manor Hospital accident and emergency department and refused to help . Geary, who was fully aware of Mr Cope's condition having brought him to the hospital, is seen looking on from his ambulance before finally going to his patient. But he takes no equipment with him and instead casually stands over Mr Cope with his hands in his pockets, talking to him for two minutes. After taking a closer look at Mr Cope, Geary then asks the hospital security to deal with him, before returning to his ambulance at 11.15am. When the security guard is seen arriving a full five minutes later, Mr Cope did not appear to be showing any signs of life. A post mortem examination later revealed Mr Cope died of a heart attack. Expert evidence indicated that had Mr Cope's chest pain been considered cardiac and had he been monitored properly then his chances of survival would have been significantly higher. Staggering: Mr Cope (circled) is seen stumbling through the hospital car park after leaving accident and emergency to buy himself a drink. Seconds later, he collapses after suffering a heart attack . Collapse: Immediately after Mr Cope falls to the ground at 11.13am, Geary (circled) can be seen looking on calmly from his ambulance to the right of the screen as cars swerve to avoid him . Approach: Reluctantly, Geary (circled) then calmly strolled toward Mr Cope and spoke to him for two minutes before deciding not to help the dying man . Abandoned: But Geary is then seen turning his back on Mr Cope at 11.15am and instead alerts hospital security and asks them to deal with the dying man . Ignored: Geary is then seen calmly strolling back to his ambulance, having deciding not to help Mr Cope. He is left alone and in agony just yards outside the hospital doors . Dying: A full seven minutes after Mr Cope first fell to the ground in agony, Geary (in white shirt) can be seen looking on after security guards finally arrived to help. By now, it was 11.20am and Mr Cope was not showing any sign of life . Geary was handed an eight month suspended sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to complete 240 hours community service. Brian Dean, defending him, said: 'His career as a paramedic is now over.' Sentencing, Judge John Warner described Geary's treatment of Mr Cope as a 'truly lamentable' sequence of events. Detective Inspector Justin Spanner, who led the two-year investigation into Mr Cope's death, said: 'Carl had a serious heart condition - that's why he dialled 999. 'After Carl collapsed outside the hospital, Geary did nothing on that day to care for him and there is a chance that if he had actually done something, then Carl would still be alive today. 'Geary's actions were purely his own, as indicated by the CCTV which shows him with his hands in his pockets while Carl dies in front of him. 'He is no way an example of other ambulance staff, the vast majority of whom do a wonderful job in challenging circumstances. 'The CCTV was handed to us by West Midlands Ambulance Service, who were also concerned about what they had seen.' Devastated: Mr Cope's brother Paul outside Wolverhampton Crown Court tonight. In a statement, the family said: 'It's hard to lose a loved one but to lose a loved one under such tragic circumstances has had a devastating effect on our family' He added: 'We hope this case reassures people that where we find evidence of wrongdoing and if proved, we will work tirelessly to secure a conviction. 'As ever, our condolences remain with Carl's family who continue to grieve for their loss in these tragic circumstances.' Mr Cope, from Bloxwich, near Walsall,  would have celebrated his 50th birthday last year. In a statement, his heartbroken family of four brothers and two sisters, said: 'Nobody should ever have to go through what we have endured for the past two-and-a-half years. 'It's hard to lose a loved one but to lose a loved one under such tragic circumstances has had a devastating effect on our family. 'We still can't understand what happened to him that day and none of us can come to terms with the loss that someone - who was such a big part of our family - was taken from us so unneccesarily.' Scene: Walsall Manor Hospital where Mr Cope died in June 2012. Detective Inspector Justin Spanner, who led the investigation into his death, said: 'Carl had been treated very poorly and we were determined the circumstances surrounding his death were not simply swept under the carpet' Geary was among five ambulance and hospital staff arrested on suspicion of manslaughter in connection with Mr Cope's death in December 2012. However, detectives were unable to proceed with the manslaughter charges as there was a chance Mr Cope may not have survived his heart attack. Det Insp Spanner added: 'We had seen the CCTV footage of Carl collapsing and listened to his 999 call. 'Carl had been treated very poorly and we were determined the circumstances surrounding his death were not simply swept under the carpet. 'We couldn't move forward with a manslaughter prosecution so we began to investigate what other offences may have been committed. 'Three people − Geary, another ambulance worker and a nurse − who were no longer working in their jobs as a result of the initial investigation, were then charged with failing to discharge their duties in taking care of the health and safety of Carl Cope.' Geary, from Great Wyrley, Staffordshire, admitted the charge against him in December 2014 with charges against the other two later being dropped.","Carl Cope died outside A&E as paramedic Matt Geary casually looked on .

Guests will need to buy a table for 10 at a cost of £64,000 to get two VIP tickets to the event and be in with a chance to meet the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Sunday Times reported. The Manhattan gala dinner will raise money for St Andrews as well as raise the profile of the Scottish university. The couple met there in 2002 after they enrolled on the same History of Art course. Other guests at the event are likely to include Olivier Sarkozy, half brother of the former French president, and his fiancee Mary-Kate Olsen. It has been organised by Stanislas de Quercize, chief executive of Cartier. Guests must pay £64,000 to be in with a chance to meet the Duchess, pictured at a private dinner in 2011 . The event at the Metropolitan Museum of Art is almost sold out and tables for 10 cost more than £60,000 .

"Useful and attractive: Research has found the essential oil from rosemary helps long-term memory and alertness . Shakespeare was right in saying rosemary can improve your memory. Researchers have found for the first time that essential oil from the herb when sniffed in advance enables people to remember to do things. It could help patients take their medication on time, it is claimed, or even help the forgetful to post a birthday card. In a series of tests rosemary essential oil from the herb increased the chances of remembering to do things in the future, by 60-75 per cent compared with people who had not been exposed to the oil. Other studies have shown the oil increases alertness and enhances long-term memory. Rosemary has been long been linked to memory, with the most famous literary reference found in Hamlet when Ophelia declares: ‘There’s rosemary, that’s for remembrance: pray, love, remember.’ It is used in modern-day herbal medicine as a mild painkiller and for migraines and digestive problems. A team of psychologists at Northumbria University, Newcastle, tested the effects of essential oils from rosemary. Dr Mark Moss, who will present the findings today at the British Psychology Society conference in Harrogate, said the benefit of aromas was becoming clear through scientific investigation. He said ‘We wanted to build on our previous research that indicated rosemary aroma improved long-term memory and mental arithmetic. ‘In this study we focused on prospective memory, which involves the ability to remember events that will occur in the future and to remember to complete tasks at particular times. This is critical for everyday functioning, for example when someone needs to remember to post a birthday card or to take medication at a particular time.’ Rosemary essential oil was diffused in to a testing room by placing four drops on an aroma stream fan diffuser and switching this on five minutes before people entered the room. Altogether 66 people took part in the study and were randomly allocated to either the rosemary-scented room or another room with no scent. In each room participants completed a test designed to assess their prospective memory functions. Herb lore: William Shakespeare referred to rosemary's power to enhance the memory in Ophelia¿s line in Hamlet . This included tasks such as hiding objects and asking participants to find them at the end of the test and instructing them to pass a specified object to the researcher at a particular time. All the tasks had to be done with no prompting but if the task was not performed then different degrees of prompting were used. The more prompting that was used the lower the score. The volunteers, all healthy adults, also completed questionnaires assessing their mood. Blood was taken from volunteers and analysed to see if performance levels and changes in mood following exposure to the rosemary aroma were related to concentrations of a compound known as 1,8-cineole present in the blood. The compound is also found in the essential oil of rosemary and has previously been shown to act on the biochemical systems that underpin memory. The results showed that participants in the rosemary-scented room performed better on the prospective memory tasks than the participants in the room with no scent. This was the case for remembering events, remembering to complete tasks at particular times, and the speed of recall. The results from the blood analysis found that significantly greater amounts of 1,8-cineole were present in the plasma of those in the rosemary scented room, suggesting that sniffing the aroma led to higher concentrations. Power of herbs: Rosemary is also used as a painkiller and for migraines and digestion . Previous research suggests volatile molecules from essential oils can be absorbed into the bloodstream through the nose. The chemicals also stimulate the olfactory nerve in the nose directly, which could have effects on brain functioning. Researcher Jemma McCready said ‘The difference between the two groups was 60-75 per cent, for example one group would remember to do seven things compared with four tasks completed by those who did not smell the oil, and they were quicker. ‘We deliberately set them a lot of tasks, so it’s possible that people who multi-task could function better after sniffing rosemary oil.’ Miss McCready said ‘There was no link between the participants’ mood and memory. This suggests performance is not influenced as a consequence of changes in alertness or arousal. ‘These findings may have implications for treating individuals with memory impairments. ‘It supports our previous research indicating that the aroma of rosemary essential oil can enhance cognitive functioning in healthy adults, here extending to the ability to remember events and to complete tasks in the future. ‘Remembering when and where to go and for what reasons underpins everything we do, and we all suffer minor failings that can be frustrating and sometimes dangerous. ‘Further research is needed to investigate if this treatment is useful for older adults who have experienced memory decline’ she added.","The Tudors believed rosemary had powers to enhance memory .

"Legal battle: The Fathers4Justice advert that attacked Miss Winslet for suggesting she is against sharing parenting with her ex-husband . With three children by three fathers, Kate Winslet was keen to point out that her offspring weren’t passed ‘from pillar to post’ between parents. In fact, she could not have been clearer, saying in an interview: ‘None of this 50/50 time with the mums and dads – my children live with me; that is it.’ But Miss Winslet’s declaration has plunged her into a legal battle with campaigners Fathers4Justice, after it emerged the group was planning to use her in a new campaign. Miss Winslet’s lawyers have threatened to sue the group after discovering it plans to publish an advert attacking the Oscar-winner for suggesting she is against shared parenting with her ex-husbands. The advert features the comments about her children – given in an interview with Vogue – under a close-up of the actress and a headline saying: ‘Kate, every child deserves their father this Christmas’. Fathers4Justice say they have also been contacted by Miss Winslet’s ex-husband Sam Mendes. The film director told them: ‘It is inappropriate for this organisation to involve my family and I when they know nothing of our personal circumstances. 'Whilst I fully support fathers’ rights, I can happily state this has never been a concern for me or my son.’ Miss Winslet’s solicitors issued the group with a letter on Tuesday claiming the advert, which Fathers4Justice says is due to appear imminently, was ‘misleading and seriously defamatory’. Mother-of-three Kate Winslet targeted by Fathers4Justice advertising campaign for saying 'my children live with me' The mother, pictured here with third husband Ned Rocknroll, allegedly said in an interview that her children weren't passed 'from pillar to post' Fathers4Justice said it initially . agreed to hold off from placing the adverts to give the 38-year-old time . to confirm that her comments were accurate. However, . they said yesterday that no explanation had been forthcoming and they . planned to continue with their attempts to place the advert. Miss Winslet gave birth to her third child, a boy, 11 days ago. It is her first with third husband, Ned RocknRoll. She . also has a 13-year-old daughter, Mia, from her first marriage to . director Jim Threapleton and a nine-year-old son, Joe, from her marriage . to Mr Mendes. Kate Winslet, seen here with first husband Jim Threapleton, defended herself from any suggestion that her children may be victims in her divorces . In a letter to the organisation, Mr Mendes claimed the advert was 'false and damaging', the campaign group alleged . In the Vogue interview, the actress defended herself against accusations that her children were the victims of her divorces. She said: ‘People go, “Oh, my God! Those poor children! They must have gone through so much”. 'Says who? They’ve always been with me. They don’t go from pillar to post; they’re not flown here and there with nannies. 'That’s . never happened. My kids don’t go back and forth; none of this 50/50 . time with the mums and dads – my children live with me; that is it. That . is it!’ Nadine O’Connor of . Fathers4Justice said: ‘We believe the content of the advert is accurate, . balanced and reflective of her comments. Fathers4Justice has not made . any comment in our advert about the personal arrangements of Kate .

"Horrific: Kimberly Lindsey, 49, was found decapitated and missing her fingerprints in a South Florida sugar cane field Thursday . The doctor ex-husband of a beloved South Florida school nurse whose body was found decapitated in a sugar cane field Thursday would have been charged in her death but he killed himself before police caught up to him. Authorities arrived Sunday to a Miami home owned by Dr. Albert Lambert to find his sister and her boyfriend carrying the physician’s corpse outside in a sheet. The blood of his ex-wife Kimberly Lindsey, who had been missing since October 27, was found on his clothing. ‘The bottom line is we were going to . charge him with first-degree murder, no doubt,’ said Sheriff Ric . Bradshaw at a Sunday news conference in which he called the case . ‘closed.’ Lambert had . overdosed after what the state’s attorney called his ‘brutal’ and . ‘premeditated’ slaying of his ex-wife and the mother of his children. He . took off her head and fingerprints and stashed the body. According to . the Palm Beach Post, investigators have yet to find either. An attorney for Lambert denied his client killed himself intentionally. Lindsey's West Palm Beach school reported her missing early last week. Her co-workers feared the worst from the start and a manhunt with 50 officers spanned across four Florida counties. Her body was found days later in Hendry County by maintenance workers. A . cause of death has not been released, but a probable cause affidavit . for Lambert’s arrest indicates that a bullet was found in the mother of . three’s chest. The . sheriff's office said Saturday that there had been a violent . confrontation at Lindsey's Palm Beach Gardens home, ‘after which the . body was removed and taken to the remote area where it was discovered.’ Scroll down for video... Terrible twist: Police arrived at a Miami home to charge Lindsey's doctor ex-husband Albert Lambert--seen here with their three young daughters-- when they found his sister and her boyfriend carrying his corpse in a sheet . Grisly: Lindsey went missing October 27. Her three daughters and fearful co-workers had been pleading for help cracking the case. Unfortunately that break came in an unfathomable way Sunday when police closed the case, fingering Linsdey dead ex . Bradshaw . said his office put Lambert under 24-hour surveillance after Lindsey's . body was found and the missing person case became a homicide . investigation. The U.S. Marshal's Office and 25 detectives worked on the . case, he said. Lindsey and Lambert divorced in February, but tensions continued through a child-support hearing last week. The couple had three daughters, ages 16, 18 and 20. While the search for Lindsey continued, her deeply concerned children and co-workers tried to remain hopeful she would be found. ‘It's . heart-breaking to be away from her. It's harder than anything that . we've ever been through and it's really scary not knowing what's . happening and we will do anything to bring her home,’ Sarah Lindsey, 20, . told ABC News. At a . press conference Thursday, Sarah described her mother as a ‘self-made, . independent woman,’ who was a ‘nurturing’ and ‘loving’ mother. Sarah, 20, the oldest begged the public at a press conference to memorize her mom's face and help find her. Her body was found Thursday in a South Florida sugar cane field missing the head and fingerprints, neither of which have been found . Heartbreaking: Their daughters Sarah, Savannah, 16, left, and Sophia, 18, right, are now left without their parents . ‘Memorize her face,’ she pleaded. ‘Keep her in your head. Look for her. Do anything you can you never where she might be.’ Her co-workers gathered for a vigil Friday, where they prayed for their friend’s safe return. ‘She’s . a fun girl and to think of never hearing her laugh again is . heartbreaking,’ said Laura Hanley, a co-worker who organized the vigil, . where friends lit candles and brought roses. ‘We’re looking for hope and . miracles.’ Unfortunately . that miracle wouldn’t come. And the bizarre end to this already sad . case comes with few, if any, satisfying answers. ‘I . hope that they take some comfort that an entire community grieves for . them and is praying for them,’ said Palm Beach County State's Attorney . Dave Aronberg. Lindsey was last seen last weekend after a trip to Florida's west coast, and a text to one of her daughters gave no indication that anything was wrong, authorities said. Bak Middle School of the Arts reported Lindsey missing. School officials say they will rename their clinic in Lindsey's memory. Grief counselors will be at the West Palm Beach school Monday to ‘help both children and adults cope with this senseless act of violence and loss of life,’ Principal Sally Rozanski wrote in a letter to parents. ‘Our heartfelt sympathy goes out to the entire family,’ Palm Beach County Schools Superintendent Wayne Gent said Saturday. ‘This is such a tragic event for the school and community.’ var nbcLP={};nbcLP.aRandomNumber=Math.floor(Math.random()*10000);nbcLP.currentPageLoc=encodeURIComponent(window.location.href);nbcLP.currentSiteLoc=encodeURIComponent(window.location.host);nbcLP.defaultWidth=634;nbcLP.defaultHeight=367;nbcLP.cmsID=""230423951"";nbcLP.vidPid=""bUZGW2KP8kUz"";nbcLP.vidSec=""news"";nbcLP.vidSubSec=""${nbc.subsection}"";nbcLP.vidFrame=document.getElementById(""nbcLP230423951"");nbcLP.vidFrame.style.border=""none"";nbcLP.vidFrame.width=nbcLP.defaultWidth;nbcLP.vidFrame.height=nbcLP.defaultHeight;nbcLP.vidFrame.scrolling=""no"";nbcLP.vidFrame.src=""http://www.nbcmiami.com/templates/nbc_partner_player?cmsID=""+nbcLP.cmsID+""&videoID=""+nbcLP.vidPid+""&width=""+nbcLP.defaultWidth+""&height=""+nbcLP.defaultHeight+""&sec=""+nbcLP.vidSec+""&subsec=""+nbcLP.vidSubSec+""&turl=""+nbcLP.currentSiteLoc+""&ourl=""+nbcLP.currentPageLoc+""&rand=""+nbcLP.aRandomNumber; .","West Palm Beach school nurse Kimberly Lindsey was missing since October 27 .

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been invited to make an official visit to China early next year, when Kate could be eight months pregnant with the couple's second child. Chinese officials are said to be keen for the Royal couple to visit in a bid to improve political and trade relations between the two countries. However there are concerns that the Duchess could be nearing eight months pregnant by the time of the visit. Clarence House said plans had not yet been made for a visit by the pair and it was too early to confirm whether they would travel to the country. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been invited to visit China early next year, but there are concerns that the Duchess's pregnancy could hamper the trip as she is due to give birth to their second child in April . Officials in China are understood to be hopeful that a visit by the couple could take place before April next year, the Sunday Telegraph reported. Prince George, who turned one in July, is not expected to accompany them. Chinese leaders are likely to view a visit by the Duke and Duchess as a way to improve relations between the two countries, which have been strained by visits to the UK by the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet, and his relationship with Prince Charles and the Prime Minister. In June Li Keqiang, the current Chinese Premier, met the Queen during a visit to Britain. His visit was the first time a Premier had visited the UK since a row in 2012 about David Cameron meeting the Dalai Lama. However, the Duchess of Cambridge's pregnancy could affect the trip going ahead. She is believed to be around four months pregnant and is due to give birth in April 2015. The Queen met Chinese premier Li Keqiang at Windsor Castle in June, the first visit by a Premier since 2012 . This could hamper a possible trip by the couple as most airlines will not transport pregnant women who are more than 36 weeks pregnant. It is hoped a visit by the couple could be more successful that previous royal trips to the country. Prince Charles visited China in 1997 when Hong Kong became part of the country and was rumoured to describe Chinese leaders as 'waxworks.' The last time the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh visited was in 1986 when the Duke was overheard describing Beijing as 'ghastly.' 2011 - Shortly after they were married the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge made an official tour of Canada. It was the third time Prince William had visited the country and the first for Kate. 2012 - The couple visited Singapore, Malaysia, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu in September on behalf of the Queen as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. Their visit took in eight cities. 2014 - The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, accompanied by Prince George who was nine months old, completed a 19 day royal tour of Australia and New Zealand in April. 2014 - The Duchess of Cambridge had to cancel her first solo tour to Malta in September because she was suffering with hyperemesis gravidarum - a severe vomiting condition. Prince went in place of his wife. 2014 - The couple are due to visit New York in December and will attend a fundraiser for St Andrew's University at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Mew York.

"Wrestling to rip-off fiendishly sticky paper airline luggage tags could become a thing of the past. British Airways has begun customer-trials of new re-useable digital bag-tags. The personalised electronic tags eliminate the need for a new paper version every time you fly and are now being tested by passengers flying in and out of Heathrow’s Terminal 5. BA’s electronic bag-tag can be used by passengers who have their booking details sent to their smart-phone using the British Airways app. Demonstration video below... British Airways is trialling new electronic bag-tags, which could replace traditional sticky paper ones . The personalised electronic tags eliminate the need for a new paper version every time you fly and are now being tested by passengers flying in and out of Heathrow¿s Terminal 5 . Guinea-pig passengers will use their smartphone to check in, choose their seat and obtain their mobile boarding pass. The app then automatically updates the digital bag-tag with a unique barcode, containing new flight details and an easy-to-see view of their bag’s destination just by holding the phone over it. Each time the passenger flies, the electronic bar code on the tag changes. Employees from software giant Microsoft using Nokia Lumia Windows Phones have been selected to take part as the first passenger guinea-pigs in the month-long trial. Each electronic bag-tag carries a special computer chip and has two small mini-computer screens on each side, similar to those on an iPhone or Kindle ‘e-reader’ device. At check-in, passengers hold their smartphone, carrying their booking details, over the tag. The phone then transmits these details wirelessly to the tag, which then displays them on the mini-screens in the form of a bar-code and in summary form as written words. The electronic screens ‘fix’ the image on the tag for the duration of the trip – allowing it to be scanned electronically when going through luggage handling at departure, on to the plane, and through to the luggage collection carousel in the arrivals. Only when the customer checks onto a new flight will the bar code be changed and updated for that service. BA said the new system will be quicker and more efficient than the traditional paper tag . BA said the hi-tech tag can be used ‘time and time again’ with a different bar-code programmed for each new flight. The battery switches off once the image is ‘fixed’ and will last around five years. A BA spokesman said: ’Once checked in, customers just need to hold their smartphone over theelectronic tag, which automatically updates with a unique barcode containing their flight details and an easy-to-see view of their bag’s destination.’ The company said the new system will be quicker and more efficient than the old paper tags. ’It means customers save precious time by having their electronic tag quickly scanned at the bag drop, going straight through security to relax before catching their flight,’ the spokesman said. ‘The digital bag tag contains all a customer’s baggage details and could eventually do away with the need for a new paper tag every time you fly. ‘Comprehensive testing of the tag has already taken place to make sure it works in a live airport environment and can stand up to the rigours of airport baggage systems and everyday travel.’ Glenn Morgan, British Airways’ head of services, said: ‘The customer trials take us another step closer to making the personalised digital bag tag a reality for our customers. We’re grateful for Microsoft’s support during the trial, which will help us shape the future of checking in for flights.’ He added: ‘British Airways has a long history of innovation. The digital bag tag is a tangible demonstration of our commitment to developing new technology and holds the promise of making checking in for flights even quicker and smoother’. Guinea-pig passengers will use their smartphone to check in, choose their seat and obtain their mobile boarding pass . British Airways’ managing director for customers, Frank van der Post, said: ‘This is a fantastically simple, yet smart device that gives each customer the choice to have their own personalised electronic baggage tag that changes with the swipe of a smartphone – every time they fly.’ The electronic tags have been developed by British Airways in partnership Densitron Displays, and Designworks Windsor. Heathrow Airport is also helping with the trials. BA said that over the next five years  it is investing more than £5billion in new technology, including  its first new Airbus A380 ‘superjumbo’, which arrives next month.","Electronic tags designed to do away with need for paper labels .

"President Obama's proposed $60.4 billion federal aid for victims of Hurricane Sandy has been revealed stuffed with millions in spending for museums and NASA with portions sent as far from the Northeast’s destruction as Alaska. Now dubbed the 'Sandy scam' by its critics, only a portion of the federal funding goes directly to states and victims hardest hit by superstorm Sandy in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. Instead $150 million is slated to benefit Alaskan fisheries, $8 million to homeland security and the justice departments for new cars, office equipment, furniture and 'mobile X-Ray machines,' and $41 million for eight military bases including Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, the New York Post reports. Direct victims: A homeowner of this Hurricane Sandy damaged home in Belle Harbor in New York walks past his property as one of the millions affected by the storm . A whopping $13 . billion will go to preventing future storm damage, including soil erosion . and tree planting said to 'help reduce flood effects, protect water sources, decrease soil erosion and . improve wildlife habitat.' Preparation against future storms:$13 billion to 'mitigation' projects that prepare for future storms . VA Manhattan Medical Center$207 million . Alaskan fisheries through NOAA:$150 million . Military bases: Eight along the storm’s path, including Guantanamo Bay, Cuba$41 million . Homeland Security and Justice departments for vehicles and equipment:$8 million . Kennedy Space Center, Florida:$4 million to repair sand berms and dunes . Plum Island Animal Disease Center, New York:$3.3 million . Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.:$2 million to repair museum roofs . National cemeteries:$1.1 million for repairs . Other slices of the pie will provide $4 million . to Florida's Kennedy Space Center and $2 million to Washington D.C.'s . Smithsonian Institution for museum roof repairs - damaged reported prior to the late-October storm. Other beneficiaries include $207 million for the VA Manhattan Medical Center, $3.3 million for the Plum Island Animal Disease Center in New York, and $1.1 million for national cemeteries. In all, $47.4 billion is said to go directly to Sandy victims and their rebuilding efforts, reports Fox News. Released on the heels of the looming . ‘Fiscal Cliff,’ the extravagant spending has been . described as nothing but pork by many critics  as politicians continue to grapple to reduce an . exceeding $16 trillion national debt. 'The funding here should be focused on helping the community and the people, not replacing federal assets or federal items,' Matt Mayer of the conservative Heritage Foundation reacted to the Post over the hurricane aid. Others have criticized the package’s number as unnecessarily rushed, with FEMA currently stocked with $5 billion in disaster relief funds set to last until March. Cut of the package: A flattened home in Staten Island is seen after the storm with direct victims approximated to receive $47.4 billion of $60.4 billion proposed for them .

Jeff Sessions from Alaska told the Post. In contrast, senators in the northeast praised the package at the time of its announcement, though some voiced it being perhaps not large enough. 'This supplemental is a very good start, and while $60 billion doesn't cover all of New York and New Jersey's needs, it covers a large percentage,' said Democratic Senators Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Frank Lautenberg and Robert Menendez of New Jersey. Governors Chris Christie (R-NJ), Andrew Cuomo (D-NY) and Dannel Malloy (D-CT) previously pressed for a package of $80 billion. The proposed package will require passage by congress before implemented with it expected to be addressed in the Senate on Monday according to House Homeland Security Chairman Peter King.","$47.4 billion of aid is said to go directly to Sandy victims and their rebuilding efforts .

"A mother-of-two who has fallen into poverty after losing her job has revealed the desperate measures she's had to resort to to avoid selling their home. Care worker Vickie Robins, 31, does not eat for days at a time so she can afford to put food on the table for her sons Blake, three, and Thomas, 18 months. She has shed two-and-a-half stone in the last month and is so weak she recently collapsed at her children’s nursery. Struggling: Vickie Robins and her sons are in for a bleak Christmas now she has lost her job . Doctors warned the mother-of-two that, despite her otherwise good health, she was close to having a heart attack due to the stress she was putting her body under. Mrs Robins, of Quedgeley, Gloucestershire, has also taken the desperate step of hiding her sons’ toys - so they will have something to unwrap on Christmas Day. She said: 'I don’t eat for four days a week just so my children have enough food. 'My husband Matthew and I have had to sell everything we possibly can - our clothes, jewellery, toys. 'We are not putting the heating on at home, we have been close to losing our house. Our relationship has become very strained. 'We won’t be able to do Christmas this year. I have had to hide some of the boys’ toys to use them as Christmas presents. Embarrassed and ashamed: mother of two Vickie Robins was initially shy about accepting Foodbank handouts . 'We can’t afford to go and see Father Christmas, or to take them to their friends’ birthday parties because I can’t afford to buy them presents. 'I am the only one not going to my work Christmas party because I can’t afford it.' The Robins family was plunged into poverty when Vickie lost her £22,000 care job in September last year. Mr Robins, 31, and his wife have a total monthly income of £1,400 from their part-time work - Mr Robins works 40 hours a week as a landscape gardener and Mrs Robins works 30 hours a week as a carer.  They spend £900 a month on the mortgage on their three-bedroom £140,000 home, and the rest is swallowed up by council tax, child care and bills. They are now having to rely on handouts at Gloucester Foodbank, which they began visiting after Mrs Robins' collapse. No present-buying this year: Vickie Robins has resorted to hiding some of the boys' toys to give as Christmas presents as they cannot afford new ones . She said: 'I was embarrassed and ashamed that I had to admit I needed handouts. 'I go without eating for days at a time, just to make the food last. Going to the Foodbank means we can all eat: I have been twice now, and they have been a lifeline to us. 'If we hadn’t had the food parcels we wouldn’t have eaten. I have now learned not to be embarrassed, they do amazing work.' Three million people live below the poverty line in the UK, with many going hungry for reasons ranging from unexpected bills to redundancy. Sold everything: Vickie Robins says she and her husband have sold most of their possessions to raise money for food . Foodbanks, an initiative founded by the Trussell Trust in 2004, provide a minimum of three days emergency food - from tea bags to soup. A staggering 128,687 people in the UK were fed by foodbanks between 2011 and 2012 - a 100 per cent increase on the previous year. Anneliese Sterry, manager of the Gloucester Foodbank, said the centre had seen a 25 per cent rise in demand in the last year. She said: 'We have people coming in because they don’t have enough money to buy food or they have run out of food and can’t afford to get any more. 'We are increasingly seeing people like Vickie, parents not eating so that they can make sure their children are fed. 'The problem is that if the parents become ill because they are not eating, then who will look after the children?'","Vickie Robins, 31, and family ran out of money after she lost her care job .

"From the 5:2 diet to oil pulling (swishing unrefined coconut oil in your mouth for 20 minutes), with each week that passes, there's a new celebrity health craze sweeping Tinseltown. The latest barmy way to shift pounds in Hollywood? Drinking clay. According to Grazia magazine, Zoe Kravitz, Shailene Woodley and even health guru Elle Macpherson have been drinking the volcanic stuff. Tried and tested: A new craze of drinking clay to lose weight is sweeping Hollywood and actress Zoe Kravitz even admitted to trying it out to slim down for her latest movie role . The celebrities are said to be fans of the method because it's highly detoxifying and rids the body of any impurities, making it ideal for weight loss and indigestion. The clay, which the A-listers mix with water, is said to be rich in magnesium, which bonds with toxins and heavy metals in your body before flushing them all out. It is also claimed that the quirky tipple (the celebrities opt for bentonite clay) cleanses your liver and colon and boosts your immune system. Speaking the US Weekly, Zoe Kravitz said: 'I did a cleanse. I tried to do it the healthiest way as possible, even though it’s not healthy to do. Are they fans too? The clay, which the A-listers mix with water, is said to be rich in magnesium, which bonds with toxins and heavy metals in your body and flushes them all out. Grazia claim that Shailene Woodley, left, and Elle Macpherson, right, have tried it out . 'I ended up drinking clay because it cleans out your body and fills you up. I was eating like a Mason jar of pureed vegetables a day and running.' While she lost 20lb to play an anorexic in The Road Within, Zoe admits it left her feeling 'awful'. Would you dare swig it? It claimed that drinking clay cleanses your liver and colon and boosts your immune system . It's hardly surprising, as the Food Standards Agency has issued a warning about it, stating: 'We remind consumers, especially pregnant women, about the dangers of ingesting clay, clay-based detox drinks and supplements. 'The advice is being reissues after high levels of lead and arsenic were discovered in products being distributed by online retailers. Exposure to arsenic can be associated with an increased risk of lung, skin and bladder cancer.' Speaking about the fad, Lorna Driver-Davies,  Nutritionist at the Nutri Centre, said: 'Clay for internal use (montmorillonite and betonite clay), can be used safely if it is from a company which has certified clay for human consumption. 'This is to avoid using clay that is impure (be careful as many of these exist on the market). 'Montmorillonite and bentonite clay has a molecular structure that is negatively charged, so it will attract other components (eg heavy metals) which have a positive charge. Therefore it can be used for cleansing. 'People often assume they can use the clay alone, which we do not recommend, since once the clay has done its work - you do need to make sure it is moved out of the bowel effectively to remove the waste collected within the clay. 'Therefore, use herbs such as cascara or turkey rhubarb that help to encourage a bowel movement, each day that you use clay. 'Clay should just be used for short amounts of time (one to two weeks) a few times a year, but we do not advise more unless working with a professional Naturopath.'","Drinking clay is apparently highly detoxifying and rids body of impurities .

"Authorities stormed an arriving cargo ship believed to have Pakistani stowaways on board - some of which are reportedly dead. The ship came in to New Jersey’s Port Newark this morning to waiting Port Authority police, Customs Enforcement, Border Patrol and Coast Guard officials. By midday Wednesday, all but one ambulance had quietly left the pier. Coast Guard spokesman Charles Rowe said officials have inspected 150 of the 200 containers authorities believe could be carrying people. Scroll down for video . At the ready: Authorities wait for the arriving cargo ship believed to have Pakistani stowaways on board . Alert: Coast Guard spokesman Charles Rowe said that crew members on the Ville D'Aquarius heard what sounded like people in a shipping container on the ship . Out in force: Police vehicles are parked at the entrance of the Port of Newark to investigate reports of stowaways in a container aboard the cargo ship . The New York Post reported that officials have also been using X-ray gear to examine the containers in question and are yet to find any stowaways. The drama began early this morning when a routine inspection aboard the Ville D'Aquarius showed signs of what may be people in a container on the ship. Row told the Post: 'The . boarding team went aboard for a routine inspection. They heard sounds . that were consistent with people being inside a container.' Coast Guard spokeswoman Michelle Krupa told the Star-Ledger: 'The officers were knocking on . containers during a sound check, and they knocked on this one and they . heard a knocking back.' Customs and Border Patrol agents also met the vessel at the port. Crews are now inspecting the shipping containers one-by-one as they are lifted off of the ship by huge mechanical cranes - a process that could take hours. Search: Officials were seen scouring the ship's cargo containers one-by-one . Security: The ship's crew followed protocol by not opening the container believed to contain the stowaways in an effort to control the situation . The ship's manifest said the container in question was carrying machine parts to be unloaded in Norfolk, Virginia. Rowe said the boarding party didn't open the container at sea in an effort to control the situation, following protocol. A Coast Guard team boarded the . 850-foot-long vessel near the Verrazano Bridge outside New York Harbor at about 1am as the ship . prepared to dock at Port Newark. NBC New York reported that about 2,000 shipping containers are on board. The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that officials are conducting a 'thorough investigation of the vessel.' Inspection: Authorities were seen opening and checking the cargo containers as they were lifted off the cargo ship . Waiting: Numerous law enforcement vehicles, including ambulances were seen on the pier as the ship was investigated . Drew Barry, of the Sandy Hook Pilots Association, said he boarded the vessel at 5am, about 20 miles offshore. Barry, who left the ship at around 9am, said he thought it would take several hours, if not much of the . day, to get to the part of the ship, below the hatch cover, where . officials heard banging noises. He said: 'There are at least 30 to 40 containers on top of the hatch cover, and I don't know how many more below it. Stowaway: Asem Haroon was detained after he claimed he had arrived in teh U.S. by stowing away on an Italian vessel . 'If there are people down there, with no food and water for days, they're probably pretty desperate by now.' Customs and Border Protection agents planned to open the container once it was unloaded. Officials told NBC New York that harbours in and around the Empire State get about six stowaways each year. The ship began its voyage May 30 in the United Arab Emirates, then made one stop in Pakistan and two stops in India. Its last port before Newark was in Egypt on June 15. The situation has raised security concerns over a possible new method for terrorists to infiltrate America's borders. Last year, an Egyptian man found living in a New Jersey warehouse claimed he had arrived in the U.S. by stowing away on a ship to Port Newark. The Post reported that the mysterious man, Asem Haroon, was suspected of fighting against U.S. troops in Iraq. It's unclear how he managed to make the journey, or whether or not he came alone.

"Museum Het Domein in the Netherlands. You might not think of frogs as pioneers of environmental activism. But American biologist and artist Brandon Ballengée has used deformities found in wild amphibians to highlight the damage we are inflicting on the planet. By chemically cleaning and staining terminally deformed frogs, Ballengée hopes to show how chemical run-off is harming natural wildlife. These images of deformed frogs by American artist Ballengée show how some animals are unable to grow the correct amount of limbs due to chemicals . As a biologist, Ballengée's research focuses on deformities in amphibians. The frogs were collected across the Americas, Australia, Asia and Europe. Enzymes were then used to make the tissues transparent.Injecting coloured dyes into the bones, tissues and deformities made them stand out. The specimens were then posed and imaged with a high-resolution scanner.Finally, the images were printed with water-based ink. This includes those found with more or less limbs than they should have. These mutations can be caused by chemical run-off from factories, which can wreak havoc on complex ecosystems. The chemicals make the frogs more susceptible to the invasion of violent parasites into their balanced ecosystems. Ballengée took his scientific research and combined it with his artistic talents to create the curious displays of art. 'These abnormalities are most likely caused by predatory injury or parasitic infection while the frogs were still tadpoles,' Ballengée told the Metro. 'Predators and parasites are natural, but environmental degradation appears to be increasing this phenomena.' The artistic works, known as Malamp: Reliquaries, are currently being shown at an exhibition in the Museum Het Domein in Sittard, . the Netherlands until June. Some of the frogs, including this Pacific tree frog from California, US can be seen to have additional limbs rather than missing limbs due to the mutations . Parasites can feed on young tadpoles and alter the growth of their limbs, creating deformed frogs . The entire project has taken Ballengée over 10 years to compile with the help of collaborators including Stanley K. Sessions, Peter R. Warny, Richard . Sunter and David M. Green. To find the deformed amphibians he headed to various wetlands and marshlands across the world including the UK and US. Each inch of every frog was then chemically cleaned and stained with a different colour to produce a beautiful medium for art. This colouring also helped scientists understand the nature of the deformations. From his research he found the culprit for some of the missing or excess limbs were a pair of parasites called dragonfly nymphs. A deformed English toad (left) from Yorkshire, UK and a North American green frog collected in New York, US are both seen to be missing limbs, possibly due to chemical waste . The frogs are thought to become more susceptible to parasites owing to chemical interference . Some of the frogs are seen to have an usually large number of limbs due to the mutations . These parasites feed on young tadpoles and alter the growth of their limbs. Ballengée and his partners, however, are convinced that chemical pollution has been a major contributor to the excessive deformities seen in the amphibians. Colouring the bones with enzymes revealed the unusual structure of the frogs . They believe unsavoury environment elements have increased infections and compromised immune systems, slowly debilitating the natural growth process and making the frogs more . susceptible to harmful parasites. Ultimately, Ballengée considers amphibians to . be biology's answer to the coal mine canary, a corner of life that needs to be . carefully observed to monitor our well-being. By depicting his findings as accessible art, Ballengée hopes he will be able to open the eyes of the world to the environmental issues that . concern us all.","Artist Brandon Ballengée has created art highlighting deformities in frogs .

"It has been called Britain's most vulgar car - and now it could be yours for more than £89,999.00. Student Daria Radionova is selling her bling-on-wheels Mercedes CLS 350 encrusted with one million Swarovski crystals just three weeks after it came to the world's attention. Yet while boasting that the testament to pointless excess would be sold for charity - only ten per cent of the final sale price will support Manchester & Cheshire Dogs' Home which was destroyed by fire, she has revealed. 'The car is now for sale in the eBay charity auction,' said the 21 year old ethnic Russian millionaire whose family live in Moldova, Europe's poorest country. Scroll down for video . Garish: This Mercedes CLS 350 is covered with a million Swarovski crystals costing £20,000. Now its London-based Russian student owner is selling it on eBay with a starting price of £89,999. It has had no bids so far . Bling: The car - an early gift from her parents for her 21st birthday - also has an elite number plate 'BAII BYY' The eBay listing for the sparkly luxury car. It was first unveiled three weeks ago and is now up for grabs . 'A part from the sale will go to support Manchester and Moldova Dog Homes.' The London-based student, who lives 300 feet from her favourite shop Harrods, boasted before putting the silver-coloured coupe on sale: 'When I sell the car I will give the money to charity.' It was not clear last night if any other causes would benefit from the glittering car which was valued at around £25,000. Daria disputed this, stating: 'The car cost at least £50,000, then I spent over £20,000 on the Swarovski crystals for it. 'It cost me another £15,000 to fly in my team from Russia to put them on the car for me. 'They spent 12 hours a day for two months doing it. I'm very happy with it - everywhere I go, people look at it.' The car - an early gift from her parents for her 21st birthday - also has an elite number plate BAII BYY. Magnet for theft: Daria Radionova said: 'It's quite scary to leave it in the street. People try to take the crystals. Every time I come back I have to check if any have gone' The registration was a present from her brother 'to make sure my car was extra-unique'. The eBay site says the starting bid was for £89,999.00 - and the auction will end of 16 October. It has not attracted any bids so far. Daria had also said that any auction profit from her gleaming car would go to a charity 'to help homeless people'. Asked on Facebook why she was helping dogs rather than children, orphans or disabled people, she snapped back: 'Help them yourself.' Any buyers should be ready for unexpected attention with a car that has had two previous owners and 57,000 miles on the clock. 'It's quite scary to leave it in the street,' she said. 'People try to take the crystals. Every time I come back I have to check if any have gone. 'But I enjoy it. I know some people say negative things but I don't care what people think.'

"Scientists have put together the first ever map of how the brain organises the thousands of images that come flooding in through our eyes every day. A team at the University of California, Berkeley, have found that the brain is wired to put in order all the categories of objects and actions that we see. To illustrate their findings, they have created the first map of how the brain organises these categories across the cortex. Click here to open the interactive version of the map in a new window (may take some time to load) The team used fMRI scans of patients to work out which how which regions of their brains process different categories of information (right). They were then able to show the regions on a virtual 3D brain (left) The result — achieved through computational models of brain imaging data collected while test subjects watched hours of video clips — is what researchers call 'a continuous semantic space'. The UC Berkeley team have mapped this data across the human cortex to show which areas of the brain deal with which categories of objects we see in the world around us. Some relationships between categories make sense - for example, that humans and animals share the same 'semantic neighbourhood' - while others - like the apparent link between hallways and buckets - seem less obvious. Nevertheless, the researchers found that different people share a similar semantic layout. The Berkeley team used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to record the brain activity of five researchers as they each watched two hours of film clips. Researchers then analysed the readings to find correlations in data and build a model showing how each of 30,000 subdivisions in the cortex responded to the 1,700 categories of objects and actions shown. Next, they used principal components analysis, a statistical method that can summarize large data sets, to find the 'semantic space' that was common to all the study subjects. The results are presented in multicoloured, multi-dimensional maps showing the more than 1,700 visual categories and their relationships to one another. Categories that activate the same brain areas have similar colours. For example, humans are green, animals are yellow, vehicles are pink and violet and buildings are blue. 'Our methods open a door that will quickly lead to a more complete and detailed understanding of how the brain is organised,' said Alexander Huth, lead author of the study published yesterday in the journal Neuron. 'Already, our online brain viewer appears to provide the most detailed look ever at the visual function and organisation of a single human brain.' His and his colleagues findings show that the brain efficiently represents the diversity of categories in a compact space. Instead of having a distinct brain area devoted to each category, as previous work had identified, for some but not all types of stimuli, the researchers found brain activity is organised by the relationship between categories. 'Humans can recognise thousands of categories. Given the limited size of the human brain, it seems unreasonable to expect that every category is represented in a distinct brain area,' said Mr Huth. A clearer understanding of how the brain organises visual input can help with the diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders. The findings may also be used to create brain-machine interfaces, particularly for facial and other image recognition systems. 'Our discovery suggests that brain scans could soon be used to label an image that someone is seeing, and may also help teach computers how to better recognise images,' said Mr Huth. Semantic map of the brain: This images of . subjects' brains scanned as part of the study shows how which regions of . their brains process different categories of information.  See key below . These three images are the key for the above . brain scans: Different categories are represented in four semantic . dimensions by different colours.  Categories that activate the same brain . areas have similar colours. For example, humans are green, animals are . yellow, vehicles are pink and violet and buildings are blue . He has produced a video and interactive website to explain the science of what the researchers found. It was long believed that each category of object or action humans see — people, animals, vehicles, household appliances and movements — is represented in a separate region of the visual cortex. But this new study shows that these categories are actually represented in highly organised, overlapping maps that cover as much as 20 per cent of the brain, including the somato-sensory and frontal cortices. 'Using the semantic space as a visualisation tool, we immediately saw that categories are represented in these incredibly intricate maps that cover much more of the brain than we expected,' Mr Huth said. Dr Jack Gallant, at whose laboratory the work was carried out, said: 'Discovering the feature space that the brain uses to represent information helps us to recover functional maps across the cortical surface. 'The brain probably uses similar mechanisms to map other kinds of information across the cortical surface, so our approach should be widely applicable to other areas of cognitive neuroscience.'","UC Berkeley team use fMRI to find out where semantically linked concepts are processed in the brain .

"The Spanish nurse who became the first person to contract Ebola outside West Africa appears to have overcome the disease, officials said tonight. Teresa Romero, 44, went into isolation after caring for two infected priests at Carlos III Hospital in central Madrid. Her case prompted a massive public outcry of the Spanish government's handling of the outbreak, which blew up into mass protests when her beloved dog Excalibur was put down despite it being unclear whether the pet had the virus. Scroll down for video . Saved: Teresa Romero, 44, has tested negative for Ebola weeks after contracting the disease, the Spanish government said. But her dog Excalibur (pictured) was put down as a precaution, sparking a national outcry . Innocent: Some 390,000 animal rights activists and protesters called for Excalibur (pictured) to be spared . Death row: Excalibur barking on Ms Romero's Madrid balcony before the pet was put down by the authorities . Ms Romero's husband Javier Limon Romero (pictured with their dog) is being kept in quarantine in Madrid . Thousands of angry protesters marched in the streets of Madrid calling on the government's health minister Ana Mato to resign after the pet's death on October 8. Ms Romero's recovery could prompt further criticism by the protesters, 390,000 of whom signed a petition urging officials to save Excalibur's life. Although Ms Romero's recovery would not have changed the odds of Excalibur contracting the disease, protesters had insisted the animal could have been cared for safely in quarantine. U.S. officials took just that tack when they announced they would be saving Bentley, the spaniel belonging to Ebola patient Nina Pham in Dallas, Texas. Today Ms Romero tested negative for the disease, the government said in a statement. Further tests will be carried out tonight to confirm the result, as patients must be re-tested within 72 hours. The nurse cared for Spanish missionary Manuel Garcia Viejo, 69, who died on September 25 after being infected with Ebola while he treated patients in Sierra Leone. Another Spanish priest, 75-year-old Miguel Pajares, had died in Madrid in August after being flown back from missionary work in Liberia. Anger: There was a mass demonstration in Madrid when Ms Romero's pet dog Excalibur was put down . Thousands of protesters in Madrid including health workers have called on the health minister  to resign . Protests: One activist's dog wore a sign which said Excalibur's death could not be forgotten or forgiven . Ms Romero was treated with a drip of human serum containing antibodies from Ebola sufferers who had survived the disease, and other drugs which a government spokesman declined to name. One was the experimental anti-viral medicine favipiravir, according to the respected national newspaper El Mundo. Romero is the only known sufferer of Ebola in Spain after the death of the two priests. But there are a further 15 people in hospital, including her husband, being kept under observation for signs of the disease. Photographs of them appearing at a window holding up placards to declare they were in perfect health last week were beamed around the world. 'I'm fine': One of the 15 others being kept in quarantine showed his temperature from the hospital window . Protection: Health workers at the window of the Carlos III hospital in Madrid, where 15 people are being held . Wistful: Ms Romero's husband, still in quarantine, watches Spain's national day celebrations from the window . Ebola has killed at least 4,546 people in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea in the recent outbreak. So far only two countries, Spain and the U.S., have had fresh cases confirmed outside West Africa. In both cases they arose after contact with patients who had been flown home for treatment. Outside the three main countries, there were also 20 fresh cases of Ebola in Nigeria and one in Senegal, where the World Health Organisation said the outbreak has been successfully contained. Spain has given its permission for the United States to use U.S. military bases in an operation to send up to 4,000 troops to West Africa to help contain the disease. The bases are at Rota near Cadiz and at Moron de la Frontera near Seville in southern Spain, the Ministry of Defence said in a statement on Saturday. Other protests, including by health workers who wore symbolic white masks, have criticised the Spanish government's response to the outbreak. Back to work: Wiliam Pooley said he was 'delighted' to be returning to Sierra Leone to treat more victims . British nurse William Pooley, who survived Ebola after being given the experimental drug ZMapp, has flown back to the country where he caught the deadly virus. The 29-year-old said he was 'delighted' to return to Sierra Leone's capital Freetown as he attempts to prevent 'as many unnecessary deaths as possible'. There is uncertainty, however, over whether the Suffolk-born nurse is immune to catching Ebola again. Although it is widely assumed the same person cannot develop the disease twice, the assumption has never been proven by scientists. The scale of the current outbreak - with already 16 times more deaths than the previous most fatal outbreak in 1976 - could provide the first test to the theory. Mr Pooley will arrive in Sierra Leone, where 932 people have died of Ebola, tonight and resume work tomorrow in an isolation unit run at Connaught Hospital by British medics. 'I would like to once again thank the team at the Royal Free Hospital and the RAF who provided me with such excellent treatment and support,' he said in a statement. 'But the real emergency is in West Africa, and the teams out there need all the support we can give them. 'I am now looking forward to getting back out there and doing all I can to prevent as many unnecessary deaths as possible.' He became the first confirmed Briton to contract Ebola and was flown home in August to be treated in a specially-adapted unit at the Royal Free Hospital in London. The nurse will join staff from King’s Health Partners team, a partnership between King’s College London and three NHS trusts - Guy’s and St Thomas’, King’s College Hospital and South London and Maudsley.","Teresa Romero, 44, went into isolation after contact with infected missionary .

Dr Fox said: ‘Lady Thatcher used to say that she was born a Conservative, would die a Conservative and would fight for her beliefs inside the Conservative Party. ‘I think she would be disappointed, if not appalled, to see Conservatives switching to UKIP rather than argue their case inside the Conservative Party. ‘But worse, she would be horrified to think that such switching could open the door to power locally and nationally to her mortal enemy, the Labour Party.’ Dr Fox spoke out as UKIP faced embarrassment as it was revealed that one of its local election candidates was a member of the far-right BNP and another blamed Jews for the Holocaust. UKIP . candidate Anna-Marie Crampton is alleged to have said World War Two was . engineered by Zionists and bankers to create the state of Israel . Anna-Marie Crampton the Ukip candidate in Crowborough, East Sussex, was suspended after it was revealed that she has claimed the Second World War was financed by Jewish bankers to help create the state of Israel. She said: ‘It was thanks to them that six million Jews were murdered in the war’. Crampton also encouraged followers to read the Protocols of Zion, a forged anti-Semitic hoax that claims the world is run by a worldwide Jewish conspiracy. Susan Bowen, from Boscastle in Cornwall, was earlier thrown out of the party when it emerged she was in the BNP. Mr Farage yesterday admitted that ‘one or two’ of his party’s candidates in the local elections could be members of the BNP or have criminal records and conceded that candidates that he would ‘rather not have had’ standing in the elections may have ‘slipped through the net’. Dr Fox used a speech to business leaders in Birmingham to argue the Tory party can win an overall majority in 2015 provided it shows ‘political courage’ and ‘intellectual creativity’. But he warned the Conservatives had lost touch with many of the people who had voted for Lady Thatcher. ‘Many people in this country will also have been reminded why they were drawn to the Conservative cause under Margaret Thatcher's leadership,’ he will said. ‘Their values have not changed and neither have ours but we are currently lacking the language to reconnect with them. We are their natural home and they are our natural supporters regardless of what background or part of the country they come.’ Although he does not directly criticise David Cameron, his speech will be seen as offering the party a radical alternative vision for the next election. Despite the reforms of the coalition, he said the country remained ‘over-taxed, over-regulated’ and still spent too much and borrowed too much. The Conservatives now need to come forward with a programme which rewarded risk-takers and fostered a climate where wealth creation was encouraged. He calls for a public spending freeze for at least three years, and a ‘systematic switching’ of universal benefits into tax cuts. There is ‘instinctive support’ among Conservatives, he will say, for reform of inheritance tax, which the Tories promised at the last election but dropped in the coalition negotiations with the Liberal Democrats. ‘We must end the iniquitous multi-taxing of the same money,’ Dr Fox added. ‘It is not right to tax people's income and then their savings on that income; to tax the movement of assets through capital gains tax and stamp duty, and then tax them again through inheritance tax if they have the audacity to die.’ Anna-Marie Crampton pictured left with UKIP . leader Nigel Farage at a rally in Tunbridge Wells, Kent. Mr Farage . admitted that not all candidates have been properly vetted to ensure . they do not hold extreme views . Assets sales he suggests could include Network Rail, Channel 4, and the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland water industries, as well as the Government's stakes in Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds. There should also be a rethink of the size and structure of Whitehall and the Civil Service, as well as a radical programme of deregulation. ‘I believe it is entirely possible for the Conservative party to win an overall majority at the next general election if we show political courage, intellectual creativity and party unity,’ he added . ‘Those of us who were drawn to the Conservative Party by Margaret Thatcher's desire to free people from the pigeon holes that they had historically been put into, able to exploit their own talents in a country that valued opportunity, creativity and hard work, have a duty to make that message heard in the next generation as well.’ In an apparent side-swipe at Mr Cameron's Old Etonian background, he emphasised Lady Thatcher's appeal across the class divide, saying that, as the grandson of a miner, it was ‘unimaginable’ that he could have been attracted to the party before she became leader. ‘She powered into a meritocratic era, determined to ensure that wealth and ownership were not the preserve of a privileged few,’ he said.","Ex-Defence Secretary hits back at idea ex-Prime Minister would back UKIP .

"Around one and a half billion people across the globe are bald or have some form of hair loss. Now a company in California has come up with what it claims to be the solution - a helmet that fires cool lasers at the wearers scalp to stimulate hair growth. The Theradome headgear is said to be the only wearable, clinical-strength laser treatment that people can use at home, but it will set buyers back almost $800 (£475). Scroll down for video . A Californian company has invented a helmet that fires cool lasers at your scalp to stimulate hair growth. The Theradome laser helmet (pictured) claims to be the only wearable clinical-strength laser treatment that people can use at home . The Theradome claims to reverse the shrinking of follicles using lasers with regular use, up to between 18 and 26 weeks. The company promises that such dedication results in cleaner, thicker and more manageable hair that is less oily. Hair shafts are larger and there is less fallout in the shower and on pillows. Between 28 and 52 weeks of use for 20 minutes twice a week, it regrows hair by increasing blood flow to the scalp and hair follicles as well as boosting cell metabolism and reducing the effects of protein blocking enzymes. In this time, the scalp will be healthier, less itchy and less inflamed, the company said. After 100 weeks of treatment, hair will be fuller and thicker. It claims to grow healthy new hair, double the follicle size of existing hair and can even prevent hair loss. ‘Getting your hair back is a convenient and affordable process,’ the company said. Laser light therapy has been proven to improve hair health, but cold laser therapy has only been available at specialist clinics. Theradome lets people use this advanced technology at home, and contains high efficiency lasers that produce virtually no heat but allow the maximum amount of light to be delivered, the company claim. However, the technology comes at a price as the helmet costs $795 (£473 plus shipping). It contains 80 lasers, so that light can reach 90 square inches (582 square centimetres) of the 111 square inch (720 square centimetre) average scalp area. Users of the device are meant to wear it for 20 minutes at a time, twice a week. For the first 18 to 24 weeks of use, it is designed to reverse the shrinking of hair follicles to stop further hair loss. The helmet contains 80 lasers so that light can reach 90 square inches (582 square centimetres) of the 111 square inch (720 square centimetre) average scalp area. It is rechargeable and features proximity sensors (pictured) to ensure that the lasers are in the correct position . The helmet (illustrated) claims to set about regrowing hair by increasing blood flow to the scalp and hair follicles, stimulating microcirculation, improving the metabolism of cells and protein synthesis . ‘You will find you have cleaner, more manageable hair with improved lustre and fuller body, decreased oiliness and larger hair shafts. You'll also find less hair fallen out in the shower and on pillows,’ the company said. After 28 weeks of regular wear, the helmet claims to set about regrowing hair by increasing blood flow to the scalp and hair follicles, stimulating microcirculation and improving the metabolism of cells. It ‘reduces the effects of protein blocking enzymes, promoting thickness and density,’ the company said. Theradome claims that with regular use for up to 50 weeks, wearers of the laser helmet will have thicker and longer hair, plus a healthier scalp that is less itchy and inflamed. Users of the device (pictured) are meant to wear the helmet for 20 minutes at a time, twice a week. For the first 18 to 24 weeks of use it is designed to reverse the shrinking of hair follicles to stop further hair loss . After 52 weeks, ‘the hairs on the top of the head ... will start filling in. After 100 weeks … fuller and thicker hair will result with continued use,’ the company said. The helmet was the brainchild of former Nasa scientist Tamim Hamid, who is the founder and chief executive of Theradome. He wanted to find a way of preventing his own hair loss at the age of 32 without using medication. He explained the laser helmet can be used alongside other hair restoration treatments and after chemotherapy. However, one expert from The London Centre of Trichology said that lotions can be much more effective at stimulating blood flow in the scalp than lasers. While he admitted he had not tried out the Theradome product, he said that he has never seen impressive results from a similar system - whether at home or in a clinic. Dr Bessam Farjo, Medical Director of the Institute of Trichologists, said: 'I do believe that laser technology has validity, but I’m sceptical of the specific claims made by Theradome GB  that this particular headgear has the ability to increase the hair shaft diameter by 200 per cent. I have not seen any scientific evidence to support this. 'It’s great to see businesses putting resources to the development of this technology, but more scientific results are needed to back-up the huge claims that Theradome is making.'","A firm in California created the helmet that fires cool lasers at the scalp .

"Friends of a transgender woman from Idaho who died suddenly have reacted with shock after her family dressed her for an open casket funeral as a man. 32-year-old Jennifer Gable died suddenly of an aneurysm last month. Her friends who attended the service were disgusted to find that she had been prepared like a man with her long hair cut off and dressed in a suit. Activists say the incident shows the importance of having a will which explicitly states provisions. Switched at death: Jennifer Gable, an Idaho customer service coordinator for Wells Fargo, died suddenly in October, aged 32. Her friends were stunned when her family buried her as a man, known as Geoff . Back to his roots: Gable was transgender, born Geoffrey, but living the past few years as Jennifer . Meghan Stabler of the Human Rights Campaign had previously helped Ms Gable as she was undergoing her change. 'There was no mention of the woman she knew she was and had lived as for several years. Just erosion of her identity and an old photograph of how the father perceived her to be. 'She had done what she needed to do legally to be seen as her authentic self. Her father erased her identity either though ignorance or arrogance' she told the Miami Herald. 'I am disgusted,' Stacy Dee Hudson posted on Facebook. Uneasy: At the funeral in Twin Falls, Idaho her friends were shocked to see her in an open casket with short hair and dressed in a suit . 'A great and dear friend's mom went to the funeral today. It was not closed casket. They cut her hair, suit on. 'How can they bury her as Geoff when she legally changed her name? So very sad. 'Jen you will be missed and people who know you know that you are at peace.' Adding to the insult, her obituary also makes no mention of the fact she had been living as a woman for several years. The obituary used the name Geoffrey and the gender specific 'he' and 'his,' and there was no mention of Jennifer. Erased from existence: Gable's friends said that 'her father erased her identity either through ignorance or arrogance,' adding that no mention of her transition was made in her official paid obituary either . Caught: Though funeral directors at the Magic Valley Funeral Home and Crematory in Twin Falls were aware that Jennifer was living as female, they powerless to present her as such against her father's wishes . 'Geoffrey Charles Gable, 32, Boise, passed away suddenly on October 9, 2014 while at his job at Wells Fargo Bank. 'He was married to Ann Arthurs in 2005 in Hawaii. They were later divorced. On her online obituary guestbook, Lisa Becker wrote, 'She was mutilated and disrespected by her family, and even her obituary is a desperate attempt to make her seem as masculine as possible. To her family — shame on you.' Turmoil after death: Activists say the incident shows the importance of having a will which explicitly states provisions . I hope you know what you've done, and I hope you know how many people have now been given the opportunity to educate themselves on transgender rights and ending transphobia. I'm so saddened that it had to happen this way, but I pray that her family someday understands the terrible thing they've done, and that they understand that everyone has the inherent human right to be exactly who they are.' Though funeral directors at the Magic Valley Funeral Home and Crematory in Twin Falls were aware that Jennifer was living as female, they powerless to present her as such against her father's wishes . Mike Parke from the home said Gable's death certificate listed her as male. 'The death certificate says Geoffrey AKA Jennifer Gable,' Mr Parke said. 'The last few years she lived as Jennifer. They buried him as Geoff. A tormented situation for all those involved.'","After her sudden death, Idaho transgender woman was buried by her family as a man called Geoff .

"Dried tomato skins left over from the making of Heinz ketchup are to be used inside Ford cars as a plant-based alternative to plastic. The tinned-food giant known for its '57 varieties' is looking at how it could use its bio-waste to create a 'green' replacement for petroleum-based plastic inside the cars such as the Mondeo, Fiesta, Focus and Galaxy. Ford scientists are testing the durability of tomato fibre – made largely from waste peeled tomato skins, stems and seeds – for potential use in making wiring brackets and storage bins. Innovative: The dried remains of tomatoes from Heinz tomato ketchup factories will be used to develop compartments for the inside of Ford cars in a bid to cut down on petroleum-based materials . The firms say it will reduce the use of . petrochemicals used in the manufacture of plastic and so reduce the . harmful impact on the environment. Ford plastics research specialist Ellen Lee said: ‘Dried tomato skins could become the wiring brackets in a Ford vehicle or the storage bin a customer uses to hold coins and other small objects. ‘We are exploring whether this food processing by-product makes sense for an automotive application. Project: How Ford and Heinz intend to work together . ‘Our goal is to develop a strong, lightweight material that meets our vehicle requirements, while at the same time reducing our overall environmental impact.’ It is part of a project begun nearly two years ago when Ford began collaborating with Heinz, Coca-Cola, sports clothing firm Nike, and Procter & Gamble. The scheme is a bid to accelerate development of a ‘plant-based plastic’ to help reduce use of petroleum-based materials currently in use. Heinz’s research and development associate director Vidhu Nagpal said: ‘Our researchers were looking for innovative ways to recycle peels, stems and seeds from the more than two million tons of tomatoes the company uses annually to produce its best-selling product, Heinz Ketchup. ‘We are delighted that the technology has been validated. 'Although we are in the very early stages of research, and many questions remain, we are excited about the possibilities this could produce for both Heinz and Ford and the advancement of sustainable 100 per cent plant-based plastics.’ Ford said its commitment to ‘reduce, reuse and recycle’ is part of the company’s global ‘green’ strategy to lessen its environmental footprint while accelerating development of fuel-efficient vehicle technology worldwide. A Ford spokesman said: ‘Ford has increased its use of recycled non-metal and bio-based materials. 'Rice is used to make electrical cowl brackets introduced in the last year, Ford’s bio-based portfolio now includes eight materials in production. 'Other examples include coconut-based composite materials, recycled cotton for carpeting and seat fabrics, plus soy foam seat cushions and head restraints.' Ford employs 183,000 employees at 65 plants worldwide, including Britain.","Tinned food company developing car material using dried tomato skins .

"As the Nazi war machine tore through Europe, there was still one way Americans could give Hitler the needle back home... thanks to a novelty pin cushion. With his hands between his knees and bent forward, this 4.5in high figurine from the early 1940s saw the Fuhrer's buttocks covered in a brown tufted fabric - a perfect place to 'stick it' to his Axis of Evil. And President Roosevelt is said to have found it so funny that he had one on his desk, according to Johnson Smith & Co's Mammoth Catalog Of 5,000 Novelties. This novelty Hitler pin cushion was sold in the U.S. during the 1940s for 69 cents . Some of the figurines come with a comedy tag - and the novelties can sell for over $430 . The blurb from Johnson Smith & Co's Mammoth Catalog Of 5,000 Novelties from 1944 read: 'It's a safe place to store pins and needles... and will probably be the only useful thing Adolf Shickelgruber [his father's original surname] did' The novelty mail order company's blurb reads: 'It's a safe place to store pins . and needles... and will probably be the only useful thing Adolf .

"The 'confessed' killer of beauty queen Miss Honduras Maria Jose Alvarado and her sister Sofia has spoken for the first time about the double murders to protest his innocence. Plutarco Antonio Ruiz, who was reportedly Sofia's boyfriend, is accused of shooting dead the two sisters then burying their bodies in a river bank in a barbarous crime which has shocked the world. Beauty queen Maria, 19, was due to have been in London this week competing in the Miss World competition, which starts today. Scroll down for video . Plutarco Antonio Ruiz spoke from his Santa Barbara prison cell to deny killing his mistress, Sofia Alvarado, and her beauty queen sister Maria Jose in a barbarous attack which saw the women shot 22 times . The bodies of Sofia Alvarado, 23,  (left) and 19-year-old Maria Jose (right) were found in a muddy grave . Speaking exclusively with MailOnline from the jail in Santa Barbara, 32-year-old Ruiz denied murdering the sisters and claimed he had been scapegoated by military police commanders desperate to find a culprit for their killings. 'I will not declare myself guilty.This is all a lie,' he said. 'I am also feeling pain, just like anyone would who loses someone they have spent time with. I'm also in mourning for Sofia.' Police revealed they are investigating other crimes believed to have been committed by the man described as a 'dangerous narcotrafficker'. Allegations include rape, murder and dozens of disappearances. It comes as MailOnline can reveal 22 bullets were fired at Miss Alvarado and her sister in the brutal attack. Maria Jose was shot ten times while 23-year-old Sofia was struck by 12. Wearing a green and yellow baseball cap, red T-shirt and a pair of green Crocs, Ruiz seemed relaxed as he sauntered from his cell in the northern Honduras prison, through busy communal areas. Ruiz protested his innocence, adding he was in mourning for the loss of his mistress. The 32-year-old is pictured with MailOnline reporter Matt Roper . Ruiz denied allegations of leading a criminal lifestyle and claimed he was a hardworking cattle farmer . Ruiz was arrested last week before and allegedly led police to the women's lifeless bodies  in a river bank . Denying his guilt, the 32-year-old said he thought he had become a scapegoat for military commanders . Police claim he has already admitted killing the sisters and even led investigators to the muddy grave where he and three other alleged accomplices had buried their bodies. But Ruiz insisted: 'This is all a lie. I have kept my mouth shut since they arrested me. I never confessed or said anything about the murders. Maria Jose was due to appear at the London Miss World pageant this week after being crowned Miss Honduras in April (pictured) 'This is the first time I have made any comment about what happened. I don't know where all these stories are coming from because I haven't said anything to any policeman. 'I will not declare myself guilty. The police needed to find someone to blame so they came after me. I don't know why. 'They arrived at my house with 100 men to arrest me and had no respect for me or my family in our home. 'Now I'm only distraught for my mother who is hearing all these stories about me.' Ruiz admitted he was romantically involved with 23-year-old Sofia, but said the Miss Honduras winner's sister was just his 'mistress'. 'I have a common-law wife back in my village, and we have a young son together. Sofia was my mistress, it's normal here. My wife and my mother didn't know about her. When asked when he last saw the two sisters, who went missing on November 13 after attending Ruiz' birthday party at a spa resort in the hills outside Santa Barbara, he declined to comment. 'I don't want police to find out what I am going to say at my court appearance,' he claimed. But he said: 'I consider myself a quiet, hardworking man. I'm a farmer, I spend my day looking after my cows. What they are saying about me is not true. 'I'm worried for my mother, I was the one paying the bills and buying the food. Now she's living on her own with no-one, I don't know what she will do if I stay here.' At his family home, in the village of San Vicente, ten miles outside Santa Barbara, Ruiz's mother Lucia Rodrigues said her son was a 'daddy's boy' who took care of her after his own father was shot dead six years ago. His elder brother David was also gunned down in February this year, leaving just the two living alone in the large detached home. The sisters had not been seen since attending Ruiz's birthday party at a hillside spa resort on November 13 . The girls' distraught mother earlier revealed childhood photographs of the pair together as she came to terms with their tragic deaths . Relatives grieve at the sisters' wake. They had been missing for five days when their bodies were found . The siblings had another sister, Corina Alvado, pictured with their grieving mother Teresa Munoz this week= . Set back behind large wooden gates and high walls, it is the largest house in the dusty mountainside village by quite some margin. Police have alleged the the family once ruled a powerful drugs cartel, with both Ruiz's father and brother murdered by rival gangs. Lucia Rodrigues said her son was a 'daddy's boy' and could not have carried out the killings . Far from a quiet life of tending cattle, they claimed Ruiz had been give control of the cartel following their deaths. But Ms Rodrigues claimed her son was just a simple, hard-working farmer and said she refused to believe that he could be responsible for the young women's murders. 'It's not just because I'm his mother, but he is a sweetie and I miss him,' she said. 'He would always be calling me to stay he loved me and ask how I was. He'd come home with fruit or food he knew I liked, just so I knew he had thought about me. 'He worried about me and always reminded me to take my medicines for my nerves and high blood pressure. 'He became the man of the house after they killed his father, then his elder brother. He was a mummy's boy. He always preferred to stay at home with me rather than go out.' Ms Rodrigues said she had no idea her son was involved with Miss Honduras' sister Sofia, a primary school teacher. She said: 'He didn't tell me what he did when he wasn't at home. All I knew was that he spent his day looking after the eight cows his father left him. 'He worked so hard, finished building the house his father started and paid all the bills. I never had to worry about anything.' Ms Rodrigues, who also has a 25-year-old daughter who lives in the city of San Pedro Sula, 60 miles away, also believes her son's claim that he was framed for the murders. Ruiz, who lives with his mother in this house in Santa Barbara, was portrayed as a hard working farmer by his relative. Police however allege he lived a crime-ridden life, accusing the man of rape, kidnap and murder . The farmer's mother, Lucia, runs this snack store in the dusty village. Police claim however the family has been involved in organised crime and drug trafficking for years . 'How can someone like that be the monster they are saying he is. I never once saw Plutarco with a gun in his hand. 'I know (he) is not a bad person. But people will say, she is his mother and will always believe in him, so what am I supposed to say? 'On the night after the girls are supposed to have been murdered he arrived back home at around 9.30pm, ate his dinner as normal, changed his clothes and went to bed, no differently than any other day. 'It was a few days later when they came and arrested him. It was a complete shock to me.' Breaking down in tears, Ms Rodrigues sobbed: 'My dream now is to see him set free. The first thing I've been doing every morning since he was arrested is to pray for my son, that God will give him strength to get through this. If he remains a prisoner, I don't know what I'm going to do.' Back at the Santa Barbara jail, prison director Isidor Nunes claimed Ruiz' protests of innocence will not convince a judge or jury to set him free. 'Of course he's not going to testify against himself. Ruiz is a dangerous narcotrafficker and the whole town is frightened of him. Everyone knows what he is capable of,' he said. 'He inherited a drugs empire and a fortune from his father and he is used to getting his own way, because he always had power and money on his side. Police discovered the sisters' lifeless bodies in a muddy grave on a river bank in Santa Barbara five days after they were last seen at Ruiz's birthday party at a spa resort . Examinations revealed the women had been shot 22 times between them before their deaths last week . 'Maybe he thinks he will be able to buy his freedom, but I don't think it will work this time. His case is being dealt with by a federal judge, not by the court here in Santa Barbara, someone who won't be intimidated by threats or bribes.' 'What you hear in the community is that he has raped women, threatened and killed people, and is behind the disappearances of lots of people who have dared to cross him. 'Not only did he confess these latest murders to police, he has already been bragging about his other crimes to fellow inmates in prison. He can't deny them. 'No victims have come forward yet but I believe they are waiting to see if he will stay in prison.'","Plutarco Antonio Ruiz denies killing sisters Maria Jose and Sofia Alvarado .

"Cornell A. McNeal, 26, of Wichita, had been charged with attempted capital murder and rape in the attack . A 36-year-old woman who had been sexually assaulted and set on fire died Saturday morning, police said, just over a week after she was found in a Wichita park with severe burns on more than half her body and cuts on her head. Firefighters were responding to a late-night grass fire when they found the woman on November 14 and took her to a hospital. Police Lt. James Espinoza told The Wichita Eagle that she died around 9:40 a.m. Saturday. Cornell A. McNeal, 26, of Wichita, had been charged Friday with attempted capital murder and rape in the attack, as well as with two counts of arson stemming from fires that were set that day in the park and at a garage. Bond was set at $250,000. Police Lt. James Espinoza told the newspaper that charges against McNeal would be amended following the death of the woman, whose name hasn't been released. Espinoza didn't immediately return a phone message or email from The Associated Press. No attorney is listed for McNeal in online court records, and the Sedgwick County Public Defender's Office said Friday that it had not yet assigned him a lawyer. Police said McNeal was linked to the attack by forensic evidence obtained after the woman was taken to a hospital. Scene: Firefighters were responding to a late-night grass fire in a Wichita park (pictured) when they found the woman on November 14 and took her to a hospital . Authorities have said investigators believe she was attacked following a 'random encounter' with the man, but no details have been released. Sedgwick County District Court records show that a woman whom McNeal had once dated got a protection from abuse order against him in 2007, alleging that after she broke up with him, McNeal had threatened her and had broken windows out at her home and car. That woman is not the same person as the victim in the park case, police said. Court records also indicate McNeal has a criminal history that includes misdemeanor convictions for criminal trespass and theft. He was also charged with battery in a 2009 case that he appealed from municipal court to district court. He eventually pleaded no contest to disorderly conduct and was sentenced to time served.

Troy Livingston said in a press conference 'I think it's everybody's responsibility to come forward and give us some information to find the suspect'","Woman was found on November 14 in a Wichita park and died on Saturday .

"A child dubbed 'turtle boy' because of a giant mole that covered his back like a shell, can now live a normal life thanks to a British surgeon. Didier Montalvo, six, from Colombia, had the rare condition Congenital Melanocytic Nevus. There was a chance the growth could turn malignant but Didier's mother Luz could not raise the money for the operation. Didier looks in wonder after his giant mole is removed from his back (pictured right) The family were also ostracised from their rural village as the superstitious residents said Didier's condition was due to being conceived during an eclipse. They feared he was touched by evil forces which meant he could not attend school or be baptised. 'I want to grow up,' Didier said. 'But the mole won't let me.' But thanks to leading plastic surgeon Neil Bulstrode, who operated on him  free after hearing of his plight, Didier can now grow up as any other child. The story will be told tonight as part of Channel 4's Bodyshock documentary series. Mr Bulstrode removes the growth during surgery in Colombia . Didier and his family was ostracised by their village due to his condition . Mr Bulstrode flew to the Colombian capital Bogotá to help a team of surgeons remove Didier’s birthmark, which had grown so big that it was feared it could become malignant. The doctors then had to carry out a complicated series of skin grafts over several stages. Mr Bulstrode told the Evening Standard: 'Didier’s was the worst case I had ever seen. Effectively three quarters of the circumference of his body was affected. 'Obviously he has had to go through a number of painful operations, but we feel it was worth it. It’s great to see the photos of how Didier is getting on now. I’m really happy with how things have healed.' Smiling again: Didier says he can 'grow up' now his mole has gone . Mr Bulstrode is an expert in treating patients like Didier, who suffer from the rare condition. The cause is not known but experts think there is a change in the development of skin cells in the embryo triggered by a gene mutation. Mr Bulstrode, who carries out about 40 CMN removals a year on patients at Great Ormond Street, said that working with the team in Bogotá had been an amazing experience. Turtle Boy will be broadcast at 10pm on Channel 4 tonight .","Villagers ostracised Didier and his family because they feared dark forces were at work .

The official said the discussion may soon have to shift from trying to reach an agreement to extending negotiations past tomorrow's deadline for the end of this round of negotiations. Western powers had hoped the talks in Vienna could open the door to ending economic sanctions on Iran, an energy-rich nation of 76million people, after decades of hostility with the West. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, front left, former EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, rear second left, and  U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, right, wait for the start nuclear talks in Vienna . But sources have now confirmed what officials close to the talks have been predicting privately for weeks: that a final deal is still too far off to hammer out by the deadline. 'Considering the short time left until the deadline and number of issues that needed to be discussed and resolved, it is impossible to reach a final and comprehensive deal by Nov. 24,' Iran's ISNA news agency quoted an unidentified member of the country's negotiating team in Vienna as saying. 'The issue of extension of the talks is an option on the table and we will start discussing it if no deal is reached by Sunday night,' the official said. A European official who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity said: 'To reach a comprehensive deal seems physically impossible. Even if we were to get a political agreement the technical annexes are not ready.' A European source said on Saturday there was no decision yet on extending the talks: 'It's the ministers' decision, but talks on an extension could begin Sunday or Monday,' he said. Iranian and Western diplomats close to the negotiations have been telling Reuters for weeks the two sides remained deadlocked on the key issues of Iran's uranium enrichment capacity and the pace of lifting sanctions. The Iranian official quoted by ISNA said the sides 'were trying to reach a framework accord on major issues like ... the number of centrifuges, enrichment capacity and the timeframe of lifting sanctions.' The U.S., UK, France, Germany, Russia and China began the final round of talks with Iran on Tuesday to clinch a pact under which Tehran would curb its nuclear work in exchange for lifting economic sanctions. 'The meeting between Zarif, Kerry and Ashton was good,' an unidentified Iranian official was quoted as saying by another Iranian news agency, IRNA. 'However, we still have a lot to work on and it is too early for the final judgement.' National pride: Iranian students hold placards to show their support for Iran's nuclear program in a gathering in front of the headquarters of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization in Tehran . 'We don't accept any limitation': Another student holds a placard to show a support for the nuclear program . The talks aim to end Western suspicions that Iran is seeking an atomic bomb capability, while allowing Iran to have the civilian nuclear programme it says is its right under international treaties. In a breakthrough preliminary deal reached a year ago, the U.S. and European Union agreed to ease some sanctions on Iran while Tehran agreed to some curbs on its nuclear programmes. But a final deal has proved elusive. Sanctions, tightened sharply since 2010, are inflicting severe damage to Iran's economy, while the U.S. and its ally Israel have said they reserve the right to use force to destroy any Iranian nuclear bomb programme. Washington would also have to win acceptance from regional allies Israel, which already has nuclear weapons, and Saudi Arabia, both avowed enemies of Iran. Kerry briefed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone on Saturday and Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal in person at the Vienna airport today. 'Iran must not be allowed to set itself up as a nuclear threshold state,' Mr Netanyahu said about his conversation. 'There is no reason for it to retain thousands of centrifuges which would allow it to enrich uranium for a nuclear bomb in a short period of time.' Officials say an extension of the talks could last from several weeks to several months. Neither side wants negotiations to collapse, but Western officials are afraid extending talks again could make it harder to get a final deal. A section of the Tehran Research Reactor: Iran's nuclear programme first began in the 1950s with the help of the U.S. Iran's secret nuclear programme was revealed in 2002, when an opposition group leaked details of a uranium enrichment plant at Natanz and a heavy-water reactor at Arak. The government subsequently agreed to inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), but the watchdog ruled it was unable to confirm Iran's claims that its nuclear programme was for purely civilian purposes. Enriched uranium can be used for civilian purposes, but if the concentration of the active uranium isotope is 90 per cent or above it can also be used to build nuclear bombs. And a by-product of the nuclear process in heavy water reactors is plutonium, another material useful for making an atom bomb. Ironically enough, Iran's first nuclear programme was launched with aid from the U.S. in the 1950s as part of the Atoms For Peace programme. It was severely hampered after the 1979 Islamic Revolution when international cooperation from Western nuclear powers was all but withdrawn. At the same time the first Ayatollah, Ruhollah Khomeini, disbanded a clandestine research programme because he considered it forbidden under Muslim ethics. Throughout the 80s and 90s Iran's nuclear programme operated in fits and starts with help from Pakistan, China, Argentina and Russia, but continuing opposition from the U.S. IAEA officials visited Iranian nuclear sites and reported that all their observations were consistent with peaceful use of atomic energy. Nevertheless, rumours persisted that the Islamic Republic was seeking to build an atom bomb, suspicions which came to a head when the secret enrichment plant was publicly revealed in 2002. Since then, at the instigation of the IAEA and Western powers, the UN Security Council has passed eight resolutions on Iran, demanding it suspend its uranium enrichment activities. The IAEA has consistently stated it is unable to conclude that Iran's nuclear program is entirely peaceful. Although the Iranian airforce is a hotch potch of various aircraft from all over the world, including the U.S., it is not known to have any strategic-type bombers. However the country has a number of ballistic missiles in service and in development, as well as a space programme that, in a similar way to the U.S.-Russia Cold War space race, could provide it with dual-use rocket technologies. The Shahab 2 and 3 missiles currently operational have a range of up to 2,000km with payloads of 1,200kg and 990kg respectively, making them potent enough to strike Israel and other regional rivals such as Saudi Arabia. Iran also has 12 X-55 long range cruise missiles purchased without nuclear warheads from Ukraine in 2001. They can fly up to 3,000km to their targets. The country's most advanced missile, the Fajr-3, has an unknown range but is estimated to be 2,500 km. The missile is radar evading and can strike targets simultaneously using multiple warheads, but has a payload of only 800kg.","Anonymous Iranian official makes the comments to official news agency .

"A fired employee who had been trying to convert co-workers to Islam stabbed two female colleagues - beheading one of them - before an off-duty officer shot him, police have said. Alton Alexander Nolen, who converted to Islam during a recent stint in prison, was fired from Vaughan Foods, a food processing plant in Moore, Oklahoma, on Thursday before returning to his SUV and smashing it into another vehicle. The 30-year-old then climbed out and entered the building, attacking the first two people he saw with a knife he had used at the plant, Moore Police Sergeant Jeremy Lewis said. After beheading Colleen Hufford, 54, and stabbing Traci Johnson, 43, Nolen was shot and wounded by off-duty sheriff's deputy and company CEO Mark Vaughan. Nolen survived and was hospitalized. Johnson is in stable condition in hospital. The FBI is now investigating Nolen's recent conversion to Islam to determine whether it was connected to the attack. 'Killer': Alton Alexander Nolen, 30, allegedly attacked two women after entering a food distribution center on Thursday - beheading one of them. He was eventually stopped when he was shot by an off-duty officer . The bureau will work in conjunction with the Moore Police Department to chart Nolen's background as his motives are still unclear, Fox News reported. Authorities applauded Vaughan, an Oklahoma County reserve deputy, for his quick-thinking. He owned Vaughan Foods until it was acquired by Reser's Foods in 2011. 'This was not going to stop if he didn't stop it,' Lewis said. 'It could have gotten a lot worse.' Sheriff John Whetsel with the Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office added in a statement: 'These were heinous criminal acts that were ended by the quick response of Oklahoma County Reserve Deputy Sheriff Mark Vaughan. 'I am extremely proud of the actions of Deputy Vaughan and I am convinced those actions saved the lives of several other employees. 'Mr. Vaughan, who serves as CEO of Vaughan Foods, was at work and when he was alerted that a man was attacking employees with a knife, Mark didn't hesitate. He quickly responded. 'Mark put an end to the threat by shooting the suspect and saving the life of a second victim who was being actively attacked by the suspect. Heroic: Mark Vaughan, pictured above, shot the suspect multiple times to put an end to his killing spree. Mr Vaughan is the former president of the company, left, and a reserve sheriff's deputy, right . Scene: Police swarm Vaughan Foods, a food distribution center in Moore, Oklahoma, following the incident . Emotional: Employees and friends wait behind a tape for word of loved ones as police investigate on Thursday . Stopped: Police tape cordons off a black SUV the 30-year-old suspect drove to the store on Thursday . 'There is every reason to believe that the lives of untold others were saved who would have been targeted by the suspect if it hadn't been for Deputy Vaughan's actions.' Sergeant Lewis, who said he does not know why Nolen was fired, added that police are waiting until he was conscious before they move forward with charges. On Friday, Lewis said that Nolen had been trying to convert co-workers to Islam and that local police had contacted the FBI to help investigate the man's background, KFOR reported. Co-workers said Nolen himself had only just converted to Islam, according to News9. It is not yet known if his beliefs played a role in the attack. There were no immediate indications of a link to terrorism, officials said. Announcing the FBI's involvement in the case, police released a statement saying:  'After conducting interviews with Nolen's co-workers, information was obtained that he recently started trying to convert several employees to the Muslim religion. 'Due to the manner of death and the initial statements of co-workers and other initial information, the Moore Police Department requested the assistance of the FBI in conducting a background investigation on Nolan.' Records show Nolen has a long previous criminal record including assault and battery on an officer, possession of a controlled substance and possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute. In 2010 he was charged with assault and battery of a police officer after being pulled over for having a fake license plate. He was discovered to be driving with a suspended license and when the officer tried to cuff him he pushed him hard in the chest and bolted. Update: Speaking at a press conference on Friday, Moore Police Sgt. Jeremy Lewis said that the women weren't targeted - they were just in Nolen's way. He also praised Vaughan for saving other employees . Sadness: Workers stand in silence outside Vaughan Foods as they wait to leave following the grisly attack . Overwhelmed: A worker from Vaughan Foods reacts after her colleague was stabbed to death . Anxious: Employees wait in the parking lot as police continue to look into the incident on Thursday . Evacuation: Around 300 employees were in the plant at the time of the attack on Thursday afternoon . Records show Nolen has a long criminal record. In 2006 he was charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. He was only convicted in April 2011 when he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six years with credit for time served to run concurrent with later sentences. In 2009 he was arrested after an anonymous tip that he was dealing drugs out of his sister, Paige's, apartment at the Langston University Commons complex. He pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana, obstructing an officer and resisting an officer. He was sentenced to five years deferred sentence, fined $1,200 and sentenced to 40 hours community service as well as agreeing to attend drug court. He was repeatedly sanctioned by drug court for failing to stay clean and spent three days in jail the following May and four consecutive weekends in June 2010. Then in 2010 he was charged with assault and battery of a police officer after being pulled over for having a fake license plate. He was discovered to be driving with a suspended license and when the officer tried to cuff him he pushed him hard in the chest and bolted. According to Oklahoma State Court Records, there was 'a massive manhunt involving four law enforcement agencies, two helicopters... and lasted for over 12 hours.' As part of his sentence – five years with all but the first two suspended – he was ordered to attend an anger management course. He was last released from jail in March 2013, according to records. According to Oklahoma State Court Records, there was 'a massive manhunt involving four law enforcement agencies, two helicopters... and lasted for over 12 hours.' As part of his sentence – five years with all but the first two suspended – he was ordered to attend an anger management course. He was last released from jail in March 2013, according to records. Records also reveal he has a tattoo of Jesus on his chest and praying hands on his arm. He also has 'Assalamu Alaikum' - a greeting often used by Muslims meaning 'may peace be on you' - on his abdomen. On Friday, 911 calls revealed the panic after he entered the building on Thursday afternoon. 'They're in the office, front office of the building. Yeah, we can hear a lot of screaming,' the caller tells the dispatcher. 'We don't know where the person went and he went through our front office, went through the shipping office and stabbed a woman in our customer service department.' The suspect can be heard running and then three gun shots are heard, KFOR reported. 'Stay down! Stay down!' the caller tells his fellow employees. Lewis confirmed to KFOR that the type of knife he allegedly used in the attack was the same kind used at the plant. Nolen had worked as a production line employee. He added that the suspect and the victims were apparently not involved with each other outside of their work at the business. 'The victims had no relationship to the suspect. He is just an angry employee that acted out,' Lewis said. Police had been called to the store around 4.15pm following a report about a fight inside Vaughan Foods. While en route, officers were told that there had been a shooting, Lewis said. Long rap sheet: Nolen has a long criminal record including assault and battery on an officer and drug possession. In 2010, he sparked an overnight manhunt when he eluded cops trying to arrest him . Investigation: A Moore police officer helps secure a scene at Vaughan Foods. The FBI are also joining the case . 'When officers arrived they approached the business as an active shooter situation. Once they entered the business they found a female deceased of stab wounds and they had a male with multiple gunshot wounds,' Lewis said. He said the building was evacuated and searched and no other danger was found. Employees returned to work on Friday. 'On behalf of everyone at Vaughan Foods, we are shocked and deeply saddened by the events of today,' the company said it a statement. 'Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and friends of the team member we lost and all those affected.' It added that it will provide support and counselling for those affected.","Alton Nolen, 30, had just been fired when he drove up to Vaughan Foods in Moore, Oklahoma and 'attacked the first two people he saw'

"Curiosity certainly got the better of this Austrian cat who got stuck in the grill of her owner's car and was inadvertently put through a car wash. It was only when owner Reinhold Pratl, 53, stopped to get petrol and switched the engine off that he heard a screeching noise and realised that his cat, Murli, was wedged behind the bumper. But by that time Mr Pratl had already driven 15 miles from his home in the city of Hartberg in east Austria to the nearby town of Oberwart and put his car through a car wash.

"Suicide: Peyton James, 13, committed suicide on after suffering years of verbal and physical abuse from his classmates . A 13-year-old Texas boy committed suicide after years of verbal and physical abuse from his schoolmates. Peyton James was found by his mother in his bedroom at their home on October 8. He had hung himself, but emergency responders were able to restore his heartbeat after nearly half an hour of CPR, The Courier reports. He was taken to a hospital in Austin but he stayed in a coma. Five days later, his parents, who had divorced eight years before, decided to take him off of life support. That day at Round Rock's Hopewell Middle School,  Peyton reportedly endured another round of teasing and ridicule from his peers, according to KVUE. And when he got home, he shut himself in his room. 'I thought he was brooding, being a typical 13-year-old boy, and I found him, and he was hanging' James told KVUE. Heartbeat: James was hanging lifeless but emergency responders were able to restore his heartbeat after nearly half an hour of CPR . Born more than two months early, Peyton spent the first month of his life in the hospital on pure oxygen which discolored his teeth, The Sun reports. This is what school bullies first began to ridicule the freckled, red haired boy in second grade. '[His teeth] were healthy, but the enamel was discolored from the oxygen. That is why the kids started picking on him,' James told The Sun. 'Why don't you brush your teeth? Why are your teeth dirty?' they'd say. In 2010, Jacki and Peyton moved from the Houston area to Round Rock where Jacki hoped her son would have a fresh start. Video Source KVUE . Premature: James was born more than two months early and spent the first month of his life in the hospital on pure oxygen which permanently discolored his teeth . Interests: James had little interest in athletics, instead he preferred reading, Pokemon, anime, Dr. Who and video games . But the insults continued. Peyton's father David James told the Courier that Peyton was continuously targeted by bullies because of his red hair, freckles, and 'sensitive nature.' 'He became frustrated with other students picking on him,' James said. '...he was severely ADHD, so despite his love of learning, school became a struggle for him. He never had much interest in athletics. Instead, he preferred reading, Pokemon, anime, Dr. Who and video games.' Peyton transitioned from Teravista Elementary School to Hopewell Middle School where bullies continued to call him 'loser,' weird, nerd, geek and gay. Mother: James' mother, Jacki, said that if his classmates had simply been kinder to him, James would have had more self esteem and would have recognized his value . Father: James' father, David, said that his son began making comments about how much better off his mother would be if he wasn't there, he even recalled his son saying 'I should just kill myself' Jacki told the Sun that one bully would even throw rocks at Peyton and trip him in the stairwells. Peyton would come home from school every day nearly in tears. Jacki said she made several unsuccessful attempts to help her son by contacting the school's principal and other officials and even giving them a letter for one of the bully's mothers. In 2013, Peyton began making comments to his mother about how much better off she would be if he weren't around. David even recalled his son saying 'I should just kill myself.' David said that, at first, the family did not think too much of these comments, but Jacki soon took him to a local mental health center where Peyton was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. 'I tried to tell him over and over how special he was,' Jacki said of her 'funny and smart and so kind' son. 'But, when you are 13, what your mom says is not as important as what your classmates say.' Diagnosed: Jacki took her son to a local mental health center where he was diagnosed with depression and anxiety . Faith: It was the day a boy ridiculed Peyton for his Christian faith at Round Rock's Hopewell Middle School that the 13-year-old committed suicide . The years of bullying culminated the day Peyton was bullied for his faith. One boy allegedly told him Christianity was stupid and that he was 'dumb' for believing in God, Jacki told the Sun. Peyton reported the boy's bullying to school officials, but, being new to the middle school, he didn't know the boy's name so the boy was never identified. It was after school that day that Peyton shut himself in his room to take his own life. 'I wish he would have come in and screamed or punched the wall or something, so I could help him,' Jacki said. 'I just think he couldn't take it anymore.' Since her son's death, Jacki has started the 'Kindness Matters' initiative to combat school bullying. 'If throughout those years, if these certain people had just been kind to him,' Jacki said, 'he would have had so much more self esteem, and he would have recognized his value.' Round Rock school's spokeswoman JoyLynn Occhiuzzi told the Sun that the schools have an 'anti-bullying and character-building curriculum' to encourage healthy social relationships among the students. She said there is an open-door policy for students and parents to report bullying. To speak to a skilled, trained counselor, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline on 1800 273 8255.

"A British journalist was brutally sexually assaulted in Cairo's Tahrir Square as thousands of Egyptians gathered to celebrate the nation's presidential election results. Natasha Smith, 21, has detailed how she was violently attacked by a 'group of animals' who stripped her naked, scratched and clenched her breasts and 'forced their fingers inside her'. She only escaped by donning men's clothes and a burka and being whisked away to safety by two other men. Assaulted: Natasha Smith has written about her horrific ordeal in Tahrir Square on her blog . Mixed: Tahrir Square was a scene of celebration, but also of a horror, as Natasha Smith was assaulted . Brutal: Smith was attacked as thousands celebrated the victory of the Muslim Brotherhood's candidate as the new president . Writing on her blog, she said: 'All I could see was leering faces, more and more faces sneering and jeering as I was tossed around like fresh meat among starving lions.' The incident occured on Sunday when Egyptians flooded the area celebrating the announcement Mohammed Morsi would be the nation's first democratically elected leader. Smith, who will graduate with an MA in International Journalism from University College Falmouth in August, was in Tahrir to film the crowd for a documentary on women's rights. But the initial 'atmosphere of jubilation, excitement, and happiness', quickly turned against her. She said: 'Just as I realised I had reached the end of the bridge, I noticed the crowd became thicker, and decided immediately to turn around to avoid Tahrir Square. 'My friends and I tried to leave. I tried to put my camera back in my rucksack. But in a split second, everything changed. Accidental leader: Mohammed Morsi waves to the crowd during a presidential campaign rally . Rammed: Tahrir Square has become a focus point for the Arab Spring . 'Men had been groping me for a while, but suddenly, something shifted. I found myself being dragged from my male friend, groped all over, with increasing force and aggression. 'I screamed. I could see what was happening and I saw that I was powerless to stop it. I couldn't believe I had got into this situation.' The former Weymouth College and University of Nottingham student said she was then stripped naked and assaulted. Attacked: CBS reporter Lara Logan moments before she was assaulted in February 2011 . She wrote: 'I began to think, 'maybe this is just it. Maybe this is how I go, how I die. I’ve had a good life. Whether I live or die, this will all be over soon.' A friend eventually reached her and managed to guide her to a medical tent. Local women helped protect her as she put on the burka and clothes. She said: 'The men outside remained thirsty for blood; their prey had been cruelly snatched from their grasp. 'They peered in, so I had to duck down and hide. They attempted to attack the tent, and those inside began making a barricade out of chairs. They wanted my blood.' She then escaped by posing as a stranger's wife and walking out hand-in-hand with the man. She added: 'The women told me the attack was motivated by rumours spread by trouble-making thugs that I was a foreign spy. 'But if that was the cause, it was only really used as a pretext, an excuse, to molest and violate a blonde young Western girl.' Smith is not the first western woman to be assaulted while working in Egypt. CBS News' Lara Logan was attacked during the 2011 revolution. She said 'men in the crowd had raped me with their hands'. Egyptian journalist Mona Eltahawy was also assaulted by Egyptian security forces in November. And Smith has vowed that the abuse would not stop her from exposing the wider issue of sexual assault in the country. Broken and battered: Mona Tahawy was brutally assaulted last year . She said: 'I will overcome this and come back stronger and wiser. My documentary will be fuelled by my passion to help make people aware of just how serious this issue is. 'It's not just a passing news story that briefly gets people’s attention then is forgotten. This is a consistent trend and it has to stop.

"Sony unveiled its Xperia Z3 smartphone in September with the bold claim that its battery lasts an almost unprecedented two days. And while manufacturers have a tendency to exaggerate about such features, reviews of the device suggest Sony wasn’t lying. Initial testing revealed that not only does the device last, on average, for 48 hours before it needs charging again, this is the case even when streaming music, making calls and watching videos. Initial testing revealed that not only does Sony's Xperia Z3 (pictured) last, on average, for 48 hours before it needs charging again, this is the case even when streaming music, making calls and using the phone for an average of five hours over a 24-hour period . Sony’s claims were made using a so-called Typical Smartphone User usage profile. This involved using the device for approximately five hours over a 24-hour period, for a range of ‘typical usage scenarios’. Dimensions: 146 x 72 x 7.3mm . Weight: 152g . Screen size: 5.2"" Screen resolution: 1,920 x 1,080 . Battery: 3,100mAh Li-ion . Internal storage: 16GB (with expandable storage up to 128GB) Rear camera: 20.7MP . Front-facing camera: 2.2MP . They included calling, texting, surfing the web, checking social networks, playing games, using the camera, listening to music and streaming video. In tests, the phone’s default settings were applied, which included setting the display brightness to 100 nits, with battery stamina mode turned off. Nits are used to determine the brightness and readability of a display, and the Xperia ranges from four to 713 – meaning 100 is towards the dimmer end, but not at the minimum. During personal tests, the phone lasted for 45 hours before it ran out of energy completely. A number of other tech sites have also managed up to two-day battery life during tests. Engadget’s James Trew, for example, said: ‘The Xperia Z3 performs well and has epic battery life. 'In my personal usage, I regularly got two days of full use, or so near to two days that I'm loath to mark it down for the odd 10pm finish on the second day.’ In tests, the phone's display brightness was set to 100 nits. Nits are used to determine the brightness of a display, and the Xperia Z3 ranges from four to 713. During personal tests, the phone (pictured) lasted for 45 hours before it ran out of energy completely . By comparison, the battery on Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus (pictured) has been improved to last more than 24 hours on average. Sony's Xperia Z2 typically lasts 1.4 days, based on official tests . While, Michael Sawh from Trusted Reviews added: ‘You can comfortably get a couple of days use out of this and that’s without tapping into the battery saving power management modes. ‘It will push on further if you don’t have that brightness cranked up to the max as well.’ By comparison, the battery on Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus has been improved to last more than 24 hours on average. ‘At Sony Mobile, ""flagship"" now means offering a choice to consumers of enjoying a large screen Xperia Z3 for immersive entertainment or a more compact, lighter Xperia Z3 Compact that doesn't ask you to compromise on features,’ said Kunimasa Suzuki, President and chief executive officer at Sony Mobile Communications. ‘Consumers demand and deserve greatness from their smartphone - in design, camera and battery life. ‘That's precisely what we aim to deliver with Xperia Z3 and Xperia Z3 Compact.’","Official testing revealed the Xperia Z3 lasts, on average, for 48 hours .

"Sharon Minkin says she earns the equivalent of £70,000 a year in benefits because she won't go to work for a low salary . A mother-of-three says she is caught in a 'benefits package trap' equal to a salary of £70,000 a year. Divorcee Sharon Minkin says she cannot afford to work – because it would leave her worse off and her children would no longer qualify for free university places. Ms Minkin, 49 and her three children aged 19, 18 and 14 live in a spacious semi-detached three-bedroom with its own drive and 80ft garden in up-market St Albans, Hertsfordshire. She drives a four-wheel Honda CRV and her 26 ft lounge boasts a 42 inch flatscreen TV. Instead of going out to work, she spends her days writing novels – as yet unpublished – and walking her two pedigree white Samoyed dogs. Her life is funded by the taxpayer, . yet privately educated Ms Minkin – who before her divorce lived in a . £1.6million seven-bedroom house complete with housekeeper – claims every day is a struggle. 'People . might call me a scrounger but I don’t like living like this,' she said. 'So my children don’t have to share a bedroom, I’m forced to sleep in . the lounge. And having lived in a house with five bathrooms, it’s hard . fighting over the one bathroom that we all have to share. 'Then . whereas once I thought nothing of spending £230 on the weekly . supermarket shop at Waitrose and M&S now I find myself having to . choose between petrol and food from Morrisons and Aldi on the table.' But . she blames the government for creating a benefits ‘trap’ that means she . can never earn so much money as she gets in handouts. Ms . Minkin, who recently turned down two jobs because they didn’t pay . enough, says: 'It’s not that I can’t find a job – I went for two last . week and was offered both of them - but myself and the children would be . worse off. 'We couldn’t . afford the rent on the house. And the children would have to take out . student loans to fund their university fees. That means they would start . their working lives in debt, something I wouldn’t want.' A former chartered accountant, Ms . Minkin once earned £120,000 working in the City. But 18 years ago, after . her second child was born she gave it all up to be a stay-at-home . mother. Her ex-husband worked as a financial advisor and the couple had . no money worries. Scroll down for video . Pictured with her two dogs, Ms Minkin said that she did not want to go to work because it means her children would have to do what thousands of others do when they go to university and take out a student loan . 'We lived in a seven-bedroom house . that I personally designed,' she said. 'Five of the bedrooms had their . own ensuite bathrooms. We had a holiday home in Spain. The children went . to private schools and I drove a £35,000 Touraeg car.' Domestic . chores were left to a live-in housekeeper, leaving Ms Minkin, who . worked part-time for her husband, free to lunch with friends and go . horse-riding every day. Ms Minkin's financial 'woes' started after she divorced her husband . But . after growing apart, in November 2007 the couple split and have since . divorced. It was then Ms Minkin’s financial nightmares began. 'By the time we’d paid back our . borrowings and debts, I was left with virtually nothing,' she says. 'My . ex now claims he’s only able to pay me £13 a week maintenance for the . children.' Ms Minkin . intended going back to work as an accountant but couldn’t afford the . £5,000 plus fees necessary to retrain after such a long break, leaving . her with the only option of claiming benefits. She now receives £32,800 in benefits – which per month includes £1,400 housing benefit, £152 in council tax payments, £403 tax credit, £394 in employment and support allowance, £84 for free school meals and £180 for travel to school. Child allowance adds a further £130 a month. On top of that, because she is on benefits, her eldest child qualifies for a grant, which pays for the £3,500 a year fees. There is also an £800 a year bursary towards buying books. Her second child, who is off to university in October, will also have the £9,000 a year fees paid by the taxpayer and will qualify for help towards books. Ms Minkin said: 'I always wanted to be able to put the children through university. I never wanted them to graduate with debts. If I get a job, my children will be forced to take out crippling student loans.' She added: 'Because I’m on benefits the whole family qualifies for free dental care, free eye care and free school trips, which would cost extra £200 a month. I have totted up our benefits package and I would have to earn around £70,000 before tax to be able to live as we do now. 'Just to earn the basic £32,800 we receive in benefits, I would have to get a job paying over £44,000 a year.' Pictured during happier times with her family on holiday at Universal Studios. Ms Minkin drives a 4x4 and lives in a semi-detached home in Hertfordshire . However, Ms Minkin says even a salary of £40,000 a year might not be enough to force her off benefits – because by the time she is taxed she could be left with less than she gets on the dole. 'I already struggle to feed us all and pay the bills. Luckily my retired parents – who are not rich by any means – help as much as they can. 'I’m sure people might say ""oh, what a . sponger she is"" but although I don’t feel guilty for claiming benefits . because for years I was a high rate tax payer, I'd much rather go out to . work and earn that money with a proper job. 'I . feel ashamed telling people I’m on benefits. However, I have to put my . kids first. It’s no good me going out to work if I can’t afford the roof . over their heads, food on the table and they have to go into debt if . they go to university.' She . admits some people have suggested she save money by getting rid of her . beloved dogs, 'But although they do cost around £40 a month to feed and I . recently had to pay a vet’s bill for £300, they are elderly and have . health problems. I don’t think anyone else would take them on.' She also defends her decision to drive . her seven year-old 4X4. 'We live in a rural part of St Albans and need a . car. Following an accident a few years ago, I’m visually impaired in my . left eye. So I need a car that is higher up so I can see the road . properly.' And she is unable . to move to a cheaper property. 'Rents here are expensive. Although the . house has been extended downstairs the bedrooms are really quite tiny. After living in such a big house, we couldn’t imagine being in something . even smaller.' Ms Minkin used to live in a £1.6million house. She now rents a property for £1,400 a month . Ms Minkin says it is also not worth her working part time. 'I can work up to 16 hours a week and still claim but when I looked into it, I would lose so much in benefits, I would end up working for free.' Last week she went for two job interviews – and was offered both jobs. 'One was promoting a gym and the other was selling expensive wines. But the first one paid only £6.35 an hour and although the second said they expected me to earn over £25,000 a year, there was no guarantee. So I was forced to turn both down.' A year ago Ms Minkin tried to set up her own party events business. 'I’d got as far as putting up a website when I was hauled into the benefits office and accused of fraud. After three months investigating they realised I hadn’t made a penny but it was a horrible experience.' Ms Minkin believes the government should allow people to get a job or set up a business and still pay benefits, gradually reducing the amount as they earn more. 'That way I could have taken the job selling wines. Or seen if I could make a go of my business idea.' She would also like to see more done for women like her returning to work after bringing up kids. 'There should be more financial help for women to retrain.' Ms Minkin, who hopes publishing a novel will eventually get her off benefits, added: 'I am sure people will think, how outrageous it is that I get all these benefits. I bet this makes hard working people very angry. 'But anyone can fall on hard times and I’m just telling it as it is. I don’t like the benefits trap I find myself in any more than anyone else.'","Sharon Minkin, 49, says she cannot find a job that pays the same as benefits .

"The most generous Christmas shoppers are men . The most generous Christmas shoppers are, in fact,  men. Those aged between 30-40 years old tend to spend the most - with a third of the age group  happy to spend more than £500. But it may be a matter of 'throwing money at the problem' as they tend to buy fewer, more grand gifts than women do, according to a new study. Female respondents, while they tend to be more careful with their money, seem to enjoy picking up a variety of gifts for loved ones. The survey of 812 shoppers found fewer than half (48 per cent) of thrifty women will spend more than £250. But they will end up buying more gifts than men, with more than two thirds planning to purchase more than 10. The survey also reveals that we're a nation of ultra-efficient Christmas shoppers who don't mess about. Nearly 40 per cent people take two hours or less doing so; only one in five (20 per cent) needs three hours or more. Two thirds (60 per cent) of respondents said that money saved by being a savvy shopper would either go into the savings account or be spent on treating themselves. Christmas shopping for pets seems to be one of the main trends this year, as more than half (53 per cent) said they would be splashing out on a gift for their furry friend. Christmas shopping is on the up overall as people decide to flee the frantic high street. A significant two thirds (77 per cent) of British shoppers will do most of their shopping online this festive season. Cyber Monday, which falls on December 1 this year, is traditionally the busiest online shopping day, as buyers rush to make sure all their orders arrive on time - and websites slash prices to encourage them. A spokesperson for online market place Flubit.com, which commissioned the research, said: 'We discovered some interesting differences in Christmas shopping behaviours between men and women, young and old this year. 'This helps us to make our service more tailored and personal to our individual customers.'","Men will spend an average of £488 this Christmas, £122 more than women .

"Bell-bottom flares and fringed waistcoats may make modern fashionistas wince but it was all the rage in the 1970s. A cartoonish silhouette of fitted tailoring with oversized collars, cuffs and ruffles epitomised the glam disco look while patchwork, suede and peasant tops were the staples of bohemian hippies. These garish combinations earned the seventies the reputation of the 'decade that fashion forgot', but many of these looks continue to influence designers today - SS15 is set to be all about the maxi dress.

"A mother-of-two says she finally found peace after years of being tormented by evil spirits after marrying her exorcist. Cortney Stiles, 33, says she used to feel plagued by demons which taunted her mentally and even, she says, attacked her physically while she slept. It was only after she met Tom, 32, on internet discussion boards that she was able to banish the demons from her life forever. Cortney Stiles, 33, found peace after marrying her exorcist, Tom, pictured here holding their son Joshua while Cortney holds newborn Jacob . Courtney credits Tom with freeing her from the demonic possession that had plagued her for years . The pair fell in love, married and now have two children, Joshua, two, and three-month-old Jacob. She said: 'Exorcisms are not quite what people imagine them to be. Tom gave me information and support - but I, like all victims of demonic oppression and possession, could only be freed through exorcism once I was ready and willing to be freed.' Eventually the couple, pictured here on their wedding day, booked a place on a weekend retreat where a group of people, including Tom, prayed over Mrs Stiles for 15 hours straight . Mrs Stiles, who today raises her two children full-time and supports her husband in his ministry as a pastor and practitioner of exorcism, says she was traumatised by contact with evil presences since childhood. She said: 'I had a very intense experience at my eighth birthday party. I was alone in the church hall before all the other guests had arrived, when I saw a boy sat a table. 'He looked human, but I knew there was something different about him. He promised me everything I always wanted - a happy future with a nice house and freedom to do anything I wanted in life. But there was a condition that I give my soul over to Satan. 'He spoke to me as if he knew all my inner thoughts. He finished my sentences for me. When I spoke to people about it afterwards, no one said they had seen the boy at the party.' By the time she was 24, Mrs Stiles claims she was being attacked by demons at night. She said: 'As I lay in bed, I saw demons appearing in different forms. They had horrifying faces, covered in blood, with sharp teeth and claws. 'They clawed at me, bit me and stabbed me with knives. It was an extremely tangible, physical sensation. 'It happened every night for a year and if I prayed while they attacked, it only got worse. It was terrifying. I'm still suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder because of it.' In 2009, she related her experiences to an online community which included people who were committed to researching and fighting demons. She said: 'I noticed one user who was posting regularly. He was very knowledgeable about how to combat the forces which were attacking me. 'I thought that maybe he would listen to me and not think I was nuts. When I spoke to Tom I didn't get attacked. He had a very powerful protective effect over me. Cortney says she was drawn to Tom as he was very knowledgeable about how to combat the forces which were attacking her . 'I soon told him I could imagine a future where we were married. He told me he felt the same way.' In May 2010, Mrs Stiles moved 2,000 miles from her home in Washington State to Indiana to be with her protector. The pair married two days after she arrived. She said: 'For a whole year, I was still being attacked. I couldn't sleep unless Tom was in the room. If he left, even for a few moments, the demons would come back to taunt me. 'If Tom realised I was being attacked, he would go to where I was, and pray, and was able to fight them off.' Eventually the couple booked a place on a weekend retreat where a group of people, including Tom, prayed over Mrs Stiles for 15 hours straight. Mrs Stiles recalled: 'It was only then that I was freed. I was able to renounce my past life and become a true Christian. Pair now have two sons, Joshua and baby Jacob, but remain vigilant against future deamon attack . 'I had been very reckless in my youth. I had been vain and I had partied a lot. But by giving myself over to God, I was able to defend myself from demons.' Not long after Mr and Mrs Stiles returned from the retreat, Mrs Stiles discovered she was pregnant. She said: 'It was a time of huge change for me, and it was a challenge to adjust to my new life. But it was a joyful challenge too. Joshua is a wonderful little boy. He's very happy and he loves to read."" In October 2013 their family was joined by Jacob, now three months. Mrs Stiles, of Francisco, Indiana, said: 'Me and Tom are still going through a learning process. We spent a long time trying to figure out why the demons came to me - and today we're mindful and vigilant to make sure it never happens again. 'There's still a lot I don't understand. But I've learned to give myself over to God and not try to understand.' Mr Stiles said: 'All I did was channel God's power, not my own. Our goal is to share with as many people as possible the truth of demonic oppression, and the only solution to it, which is faith in Christ.'","Cortney, from Indiana, says she first encountered a demon age eight .

"An elderly Michigan woman has confessed to smothering her infant son in 1961 and may also be responsible for the deaths of her twin daughters in 1969 and 1970, her surviving children say. Janice Summerfield, 77, recently admitted at her Kalamazoo retirement home that 8-month-old William Earl Summerfield died at her hands and not of accidental asphyxiation as his death certificate reads, says her daughter Paula Gastian, 54. Along with her brother Phil, who found William dead in his bed at age 4 and was blamed for the death, Gastian firmly believes her mother also murdered her twin sisters Brenda and Beth while they were still babies. Shock confession: Paula Gastian (left and right at right) says her mother confessed to her to murdering her infant brother 53 years ago . 'I asked if she had told anyone and she said she told my dad,' Gastian told the Battle Creek Enquirer. 'He just told her, ""Well I haven't been there for you and I guess life goes on.""' Gastian said she went to her mother to discuss the deaths of her twin sisters after her father was put in prison in September for sexually assaulting a friend's child. When her mother said she was willing to talk, Gastian assumed she'd finally get to hear about the double murder--or at the very least, willful neglect--of her baby sisters. Instead, she got a surprise confession--her mother said she'd killed her baby daughter Beth in 1969 and then her twin sister Brenda just months later in 1970. Gastian says she was blamed for Brenda's death. 'She was quiet and then she said his name,' Gastian told the Enquirer about the day her mother confessed. 'I don't know how I stayed calm.' After an initial denial, Summerfield told the Battle Creek Enquirer that she had, in fact, killed William all those years ago. 'I didn't know what I was doing,' she said. 'All these years I had forgotten. I am going to die. I hate myself so much. I am ready to die.' Getting closure? Baby William Summerfield's cause of death on his 1961 death certificate was 'aspiration of regurgitated formula' Embattled: Phil Summerfield says his mother blamed him when his baby brother died and he's lived with the trauma, and that of being raised in a violent and alcoholic home, all his life . The tiny box containing the body of William Earl Summerfield has been exhumed. It remained unclear, pending the results of an autopsy, whether or not Summerfield would be charged. No investigation had begun in the death of either twin. His mother's confession was especially bittersweet for Phil Summerfield, who was blamed for William's death at such a young age. 'After she allegedly smothered the baby she put the baby in bed with me,' said the 58-year-old, who's been in and out of therapy his whole life, branded as bipolar and even once suffered through a suicide attempt. 'I was shy of 5 years old. I woke and he was dead. I picked him up and took him downstairs. She told me it was my fault.' Both Phil and Paula recall their home being a violent one, where children were routinely beaten or even tossed down stairs. All of Janice Summerfield's surviving children, even including younger Michael--who has no memory of the events and was raised in a far less tempestuous environment after the parents 'turned to religion'--believe the twins died as a result of their mother's actions or inactions. 'My older brother and I have lived through hell,' Gastian said. 'Now to know so many things will be exposed, it is a relief for my siblings who are gone but in my heart have never ever, been forgotten.' Getting answers: Paula asked her mother about the death of her siblings--thinking she'd get a response about her mother's role in the twins' deaths--after her father William Summerfield was sentenced to prison for sexually assaulting a friend's child .","Janice Summerfield, 77, of Kalamazoo, recently confessed to the 1961 killing of her infant son according to her daughter .

"A furious and sceptical senator has blasted a report by the House Intelligence Committee into the 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, saying it is 'full of crap'. Senator Lindsey Graham (R - South Carolina) said the results of the investigation, which clears the government of wrongdoing in its response to the crisis in Libya, are evidence of a 'lousy job'. The document, released Friday, said the CIA, military, and the White House did their jobs right in the wake of a militant attack on the facility which killed a U.S. ambassador. 'Full of crap': Republican Senator Lindsey Graham lashed out at the report, which he said shows the GOP-led House Intelligence Committee is doing a 'lousy' job . Under attack: A vehicle and the surrounding area are engulfed in flames after being set on fire inside the US consulate compound in Benghazi late on September 11, 2012 . But its analysis, especially the notion that nobody lied or covered anything up, struck the senator as 'complete garbage'. Graham gave his forthright response in an interview on  CNN Sunday, and implied the report was untrustworthy because some of those involved in writing it had misled congressmen in a hearing on the attacks. The fact that the House Intelligence Committee is dominated by Republicans did nothing to dampen his criticism. When asked why the GOP chair of the committee, Michigan Representative Mike Rogers, would accept the report, he answered 'good question'. According to Graham all the report proves is that the group 'is doing a lousy job policing its own'. The two-year investigation of the politically charged incident determined that there was no intelligence failure, no delay in sending a CIA rescue team and no missed opportunity for a military rescue. It also debunked allegations that the CIA was covertly shipping arms from Libya to Syria. The final report: A two-year investigation by the Republican-controlled House Intelligence Committee has found that the CIA and the military acted properly in responding to the 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya . Damage: A burnt house and a car are seen inside the US Embassy compound  following the overnight attack.  It was initially believed the attack was carried out by an angry mob responding to a video but was later determined to have been a terrorist attack . In the immediate aftermath of the attack, intelligence about who carried it out and why was contradictory, the report found. It was that, the report said, which led Susan Rice, then U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, to inaccurately assert that the attack had evolved from a protest which did not exist. But the flaws, the report said, came from intelligence analysts who made mistakes, rather than politicians or an intent to mislead. Many of its findings echo those of six previous investigations by various congressional committees and a State Department panel. The eighth Benghazi investigation is being carried out by a House Select Committee appointed in May. The attacks in Benghazi killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, foreign service officer Sean Smith, and two CIA contractors, Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty. A Libyan extremist, Ahmed Abu Khatalla, is facing trial on murder charges after he was captured in Libya and taken to the U.S. In the aftermath of the attacks, Republicans criticized the Obama administration Hillary Clinton, who was then secretary of state. People in and out of government have alleged that a CIA response team was ordered to 'stand down' after the State Department compound came under attack, that a military rescue was nixed, that officials intentionally downplayed the role of al-Qaeda figures in the attack. None of those allegations is true, according to the report. The report did find, however, that the State Department facility where Stevens and Smith were killed was not well-protected, and that State Department security agents knew they could not defend it from a well-armed attack. Previous reports have found that requests for security improvements were not acted upon in Washington. 'We spent thousands of hours asking questions, poring over documents, reviewing intelligence assessments, reading cables and emails, and held a total of 20 committee events and hearings,' said Rep. Rogers, along with his Democratic counterpart, Maryland Rep.  C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger. 'We conducted detailed interviews with senior intelligence officials from Benghazi and Tripoli as well as eight security personnel on the ground in Benghazi that night. They said: 'Based on the testimony and the documents we reviewed, we concluded that all the CIA officers in Benghazi were heroes. Their actions saved lives.' Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who serves on the intelligence panel and the Benghazi select committee, said, 'It's my hope that this report will put to rest many of the questions that have been asked and answered yet again, and that the Benghazi Select Committee will accept these findings and instead focus its attention on the State Department's progress in securing our facilities around the world and standing up our fast response capabilities.' Senator Graham, however, has promised a 'hard review' of the report.","South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham savaged report in TV interview .

"A police hunt has been launched for the owner of a private zoo whose monkey killed a six-week-old baby after breaking free. The boy Vladimir (Vova) Verbitsky was attacked as he lay in a pram at his home in Crimea and the unnamed man who kept a menagerie of exotic animals is now believed to have fled to Ukraine. The blue macaque was tethered in the yard of the wealthy zoo owner's house in Kacha, a suburb of Sevastopol. Tragedy: Vladimir (Vova) Verbitsky, pictured with his mother Agnessa, 26 (left), was killed when the blue macaque (police picture right) jumped into his pram . Mother: Agnessa, 26, pictured with her daughter Evelina while pregnant with Vladimir, cradled him in her arms on as they drove to a hospital, but died on the way . Police say the monkey gnawed through the rope and jumped a fence at the Verbitsky family home, leaping into Vova's pram and biting his face. 'The baby's head was almost torn to pieces and the child was thrown out of his pram,"" said one source. The distraught parents found Vova two metres from the pram. The owner of the private zoo rushed the badly bleeding baby in the arms of his mother Agnessa, 26, to hospital but he died on the way. Svetlana Verbitskaya, the child's grandmother, told Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper: 'Agnessa went into the house to the kitchen for a minute, to stir her soup, and it was then when the monkey jumped into the pram. Devastated: Agnessa, pictured during a television interview after Vladimirs terrifying death, had left her child for a minute to go inside her house and stir her soup . Scene: Police say the monkey gnawed through its tether and jumped over a fence outside this house in a suburb Sevastapol, Crimea . Albert and Agnessa Verbitsky, pictured with their eldest daughter Evelina, have refused financial assiatance from the zoo owner in the wake of the tragedy . 'The angry macaque rent the baby's head and then threw him some two metres away. We failed to save the baby - it all happened within a few seconds.' The mother, who has another child Evelina, 18 months, was only absent momentarily, she said. 'Agnessa would never leave Vova unattended,' she said. 'We had asked our neighbours so many times to take better care of their zoo. 'One day his Cameroon goats came into the garden. One another occasion his Vietnam pigs ran in, and last year the vet service came here to take away a bear that was dying of hunger. I heard he was taken to the zoo in Yalta. They they got the new bear instead. 'This is a rich family. they own a hotel and a shop, and they keep these animals just for fun. Do you think the owner asked us to forgive him? Not at all. He ran away to Sevastopol where he has a flat there. 'And his house is locked now - the animals are alone crying in their cages.' 'Our Vova was buried in the closed coffin. But at the last moment his mother Agnessa asked to open it so she could say good bye to her little son,' said Svetlana. The man is known to hold a Ukrainian passport and it is feared he has fled there to escape Russian police in Crimea. He sent an aide to offer financial assistance to the Verbitskys - but they refused. Zoo: The monkey's owner, who is believed to have fled to Ukraine in a bid to escape Russian police, kept an array of animals including this bear . The monkey was caught and is likely to be destroyed by lethal injection after the expected court action. Police say it highlights the danger of private menageries. The local branch of Russia's powerful Investigative Committee has started a criminal investigation against the man for 'accidentally causing the death of an underage child', for which the maximum penalty is two years in jail. The baby was killed on July 9 and buried three days later, but almost two weeks later police have failed to track down the man. The breakdown in relations between Russia and Ukraine is not helping the search. Unsafe: The Verbitskys, who live next to the zoo, have constantly asked them to keep control of their animals .","Vladimir (Vova) Verbitsky was attacked by the macaque while in his pram .

"One of London's main railway stations was evacuated this morning when a fire broke out on a train. Passengers were ordered to leave Charing Cross after a 'screech and a bang' around the front carriage of the 10.55am departure to Robertsbridge, East Sussex, after it pulled into platform six. Five fire engines were sent to the scene as passengers screamed and ran for the exit amid false reports of a bomb. No one was hurt, despite the driver being in the cab at the time. Scroll down for video . Fire: London's Charing Cross station was evacuated today after a blaze broke out on the platform . Witnesses: Passengers were on the platform when the fire took hold, and were swiftly evacuated . Officers were able to deal with the fire quickly, but it also caused smoke damage to a live wire and the hotel next door. Marketing worker Jacob Lovie, 22, was waiting for a train to London Bridge when he heard what sounded like an explosion. Mr Lovie said it appeared the train may have hit the buffers - though this claim was flatly denied by rail operator Southeastern, which said the cause was an electrical fault. He told MailOnline: 'I was sitting on the platform and there was this loud screech and a big bang. Smoke went everywhere and a few people were screaming. 'It looked like a train hadn't braked properly and had gone into the big buffer at the end of the track. 'People were jogging quite calmly to the exit and the alarms were going off. I was outside when the first police car came and told everyone to move away. One witness told MailOnline: 'I was sitting on the platform and there was this loud screech and a big bang' Another witness said: 'There were quite a lot of flames and flashing lights as well. People were just all running out of there... They tried to stay calm but there were definitely people running' 'I didn't see anyone hurt but there was a big bang and it was still on fire afterwards. It looked as though the fire was more on the platform and the building around it than the actual locomotive. 'The staff were clearing everyone out very quickly so it hit people more when they got outside the station and everyone was like ""woah"". There was one woman who looked really shaken up.' Eileen Harris, 60, and her son Daniel, 26, were on the train to travel to Tunbridge Wells in Kent when the fire started. Ms Harris said: 'Suddenly the doors burst open and a woman ran through shouting ""there's a bomb on the train, everybody get off"". 'We ran away towards the opposite end of the station because I thought that if there was a bomb, they'd probably take out the concourse. 'But the staff kept saying to us come back in and we really didn't want to come back through the station, because by then there was thick smoke. 'We were marshalled out here and told that it'd be closed for a very long time, and then the emergency services turned up. 'Where the fire was there were big bangs and pops and flashes. And the smoke, the smoke was the worst thing.' Mr Harris added: 'There was fire and lots of thick smoke, so we assumed that there was a bomb ripping through the train. 'People were running through the train, and my first thought was the reason they're running down the train is because they can't get off. 'No-one really knew what was going on.' They left their possessions and Ms Harris' coat on the train, and the police retrieved them for her. The six-platform station between Trafalgar Square and the River Thames is a main terminal for trains from Kent, Sussex and south east London and handles almost 40 million passengers a year. Rail operator Southeastern said there were delays of more than two hours on some services as they were diverted to other stations, including London Bridge and Victoria. Charing Cross London Underground station was closed for 15 minutes but swiftly reopened. The mainline station remained closed until after 1pm. A Southeastern spokesman said: 'It definitely didn't hit the buffer - it was an electrical problem that's being investigated now but we suspect it may have been where the train shoes come into contact with the conductor rail to power the train. 'There may have been something that went wrong with that part of the train. That's being investigated right now by engineers on site.' A London Fire Brigade spokesman told MailOnline: 'There was a fire reported on a train at 10.52. Five fire engines were in attendance and the fire is now out on the train but we are dealing with the smoke damage to the hotel next door. Response: More than 20 firefighters were called to the scene next to London's Trafalgar Square . The station remained closed for more than two hours as firefighters cleared up the aftermath of the blaze . 'It was a six carriage train and it was on platform six and the front carriage was five percent damaged by fire. 'The adjacent live rail was also damaged and there is smoke damage to the front carriage.' The spokesman said there had been no reports of an explosion at the station, and the cause of the 'small fire' was being investigated. Vincenzo Minore, a cosmetics firm chief executive, published several photos and a video titled simply: 'Run, run run'. Annika Anwary, who works in the station and saw the fire, said: 'I was in the staffroom. I heard the alarm so I came upstairs and I saw the train was burning on the platform. 'There were quite a lot of flames and flashing lights as well. People were just all running out of there. Most of them had already left by the time I came up. 'They tried to stay calm but there were definitely people running.' A London Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'We were called at 10.55am to reports of a fire on a train at Charing Cross. 'We sent a duty manager to the scene and two patients were checked over, but nobody was taken to hospital. 'Our involvement in the incident has now concluded.' A statement posted on National Rail's website said: 'A fire at London Charing Cross is causing disruption to journeys between London Charing Cross / London Blackfriars and London Bridge. 'Because of congestion caused by trains being diverted, Thameslink trains will not call at stations between London Blackfriars and East Croydon. Emergency response: The station was cordoned off as paramedics, police and firefighters attended . Central: Charing Cross is between Trafalgar Square and the River Thames and is used by 40 million a year . 'Trains are currently unable to run to and from London Charing Cross. Some services will be diverted to start / terminate at London Victoria or London Bridge. 'There is no firm estimate yet of how long disruption will last but it is likely to continue until at least 1.30pm. 'Passengers travelling further south than Orpington please travel from London Victoria. 'Passengers travelling towards Dartford and Hayes please travel from London Bridge.' A British Transport Police (BTP) spokesman said: 'Officers from BTP attended platform 6 at Charing Cross railway station after a report at 10.50am on Sunday, 23 November, of a fire. 'At this stage, the fire is believed to have been the result of an electrical fault and there are no suspicious circumstances. 'The station was evacuated as precaution and no one was injured.'","Fire started around front carriage of train which had pulled into station .

"Gaffe: President Obama has been criticised after referring to the 'English' Embassy in Tehran when it is of course British . Just a few weeks ago, Barack Obama hailed the 'extraordinarily special relationship' between America and Britain. But it is clearly one he doesn't know all that much about if his latest foreign policy gaffe is anything to go by. The U.S. President has come under fire today after referring to the 'English' instead of the British Embassy in his condemnation of the violence that broke out at the building in Iran yesterday. A frenzied mob of militant Iranian students ransacked the main embassy in Tehran and a smaller diplomatic compound in the city. They lobbed petrol bombs, stole classified documents, torched the Union flag and even tore up a portrait of the Queen. The rioters also chanted 'Death to England' and threw rocks. One man held up a Union flag with a skull and cross bones on it. In an interview yesterday, Mr Obama said: 'All of us are deeply disturbed by the, err, crashing of, err, the English Embassy, err, the embassy of the United Kingdom.' By calling it the 'embassy of the United Kingdom', he got it wrong a second time. It appears there has never been an English Embassy, although there have been English ambassadors centuries ago.

Back in 1479, John Shirwood became the first permanent English ambassador when he took up residence in Rome. Nile .

Disrespectful: Protesters carry the royal coat of arms after breaking into the British Embassy yesterday. Others tore up a portrait of the Queen and chanted 'death to England' The Foreign Secretary has given the Iranian diplomats just 48 hours to get out of the UK, he told the Commons today. Mr Obama's outrage over the events in Tehran are welcome, but the blunder is sure to raise questions about his approach to the 'special relationship' which has been considerably downgraded since the days of Tony Blair and George W Bush. It is not the first time Mr Obama has slipped up on his geography, either. Just two weeks ago, he mistakenly referred to Hawaii, his birthplace, as being in Asia during a press conference on the island. And he isn't alone among U.S. politicians in his geographical blunders. Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin once said the U.S. had to 'stand with our North Korean allies' when in fact she meant South Korea. Former U.S. President George W Bush was also left red-faced when he referred to Africa as a nation rather than a continent.","Surely he knows it's the BRITISH Embassy .

"A convicted paedophile thought to be part of a child sex ring linked to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann is being extradited to Britain. Roderick MacDonald, 77, was arrested on the Maltese island of Gozo after he fled the UK while he was on licence following his conviction for molesting two girls, five and seven, in Brighton in 2012. The former oil worker was reportedly living in the Algarve when Madeleine disappeared from the McCanns' holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in May 2007, shortly before her fourth birthday. The serial sex offender appeared in court in Malta on Monday after Britain secured a European Arrest Warrant and did not oppose immediate extradition to the UK. Scroll down for video . Arrest: Briton Roderick MacDonald, pictured when he was arrested in Pattaya, Thailand, is being extradited back to the UK and was reportedly in Praia da Luz at the the time of Madeleine's disappearance . MacDonald was first arrested at a campsite in the Algarve in 2010 and extradited to Australia - where he was wanted for the 1998 rape of an eight-year-old. He received six months in prison after accepting a plea deal for indecently assaulting the child in Australia and fled to Thailand after he was released, but Thai authorities deported him back to Britain when they found out about his past. He then settled in Brighton, East Sussex, but, despite being made to sign the Sex Offenders Register, was convicted of molesting two girls, five and seven in 2012. He received a year-long sentence but it was suspended for two years. He changed his surname from Robinson to MacDonald and fled to the Far East soon after. He was arrested in Malta on Monday and his extradition to Britain - to which he consented - was approved in court yesterday. Madeleine went missing from a resort in the Algarve, Portugal in 2007 . Magistrate Audrey Demicoli heard the case and inspector Mario Cuschieri prosecuted. Scotland Yard said they would not give a 'running commentary' on the Madeleine investigation. Madeleine was aged three when she went missing on May 3, 2007, from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, as her parents Kate and Gerry dined at a nearby tapas restaurant. The toddler, who lived in Rothley with her family, had been left in the rented apartment at the seaside Ocean Club resort, along with her siblings, twins Sean and Amelie. This week a new Portuguese prosecutor was charged with solving the disappearance of Madeleine, seven years after she vanished. Ines Sequeira will lead the investigation into the case as Scotland Yard prepares to return to Praia da Luz to 're-interview' three suspects. Ms Sequeira is said to be 'utterly determined' to solve the case, bringing fresh hope to the child's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann. 'Ines is still trying to get her feet under the table and is having to be briefed on scores of cases including Madeleine’s,' a source close to the investigation said. 'But she has been appointed as the new prosecutor and the Scotland Yard team has been given renewed hope of being able to start work again in Portugal before the end of the month. 'Ms Sequeira is one of the sharpest and most ambitious prosecutors in Portugal. 'She is utterly determined to get a result on the Madeleine inquiry.' It comes after British police sent a fifth letter to Portuguese officers requesting access to the investigation. The courts of justice in Gozo, Malta, where the paedophile had been living before his arrest . Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry McCann, pictured during a press conference earlier this year, are still trying to find their missing daughter . 'They’re banking on this new meeting with Portuguese police being their chance to argue their case face-to-face,' the source added. 'Ines will obviously take the final decision on the letter but she’ll consult the police chiefs on the Algarve before making her mind up.' Scotland Yard officers are due to fly to Portugal later this month to re-interview three of seven suspects previously questioned in Faro police stations. Among them are Jose Carlos Fernandes da Silva, an ex-worker at the Ocean Club resort, Paulo Ribeiro, who looks like a man seen near the apartment, and charity collector Ricardo Rodrigues. May 3, 2007 - Madeleine disappeared from the seaside Ocean Club resort in Praia da Luz, Portugal. The police began the hunt for Madeleine on the following day. May 30, 2007 - Mr and Mrs McCann met the Pope in Rome in the first of a series of trips around Europe and beyond to highlight the search for their daughter. January 2009 - The fund set up by the McCanns to help find Madeleine announced that £2million in donations had been sent in. May 2011 - Mrs McCann published a book about her daughter's disappearance on Madeleine's eighth birthday and Scotland Yard launched a review of the case after a request from Home Secretary Theresa May, supported by Prime Minister David Cameron. April 2012 - Scotland Yard detectives said they believe Madeleine could still be alive and released an age-progression picture of how she might look now as a nine-year-old. They called on the Portuguese authorities to reopen the case. April 2013 - London's chief crown prosecutor Alison Saunders and her deputy Jenny Hopkins flew to Portugal with Scotland Yard detectives to discuss the case with their Portuguese counterparts. July 2013 - Scotland Yard said it had 'genuinely new' lines of inquiry and had identified 38 people of interest, including 12 Britons. October 2013 - Portugal's Attorney General announced that the case was being officially reopened. March 2014 - British police investigating the disappearance said they were looking for a prolific paedophile who sexually abused five girls at holiday homes in the Algarve before the British toddler went missing. June 2014 - British Detectives searched scrubland in the holiday resort using radar equipment and sniffer dogs.

"The way Muslim women should dress in public has been a strongly debated topic in recent months. But a new study has now revealed what the citizens of different Muslim countries believe is appropriate female dress - and how widely views differ between them. The survey was conducted across seven countries - Tunisia, Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Turkey - which all have a majority Muslim population. And the research from the University of . Michigan’s Institute for Social Research found that most residents in . these countries prefer women to cover their hair with a traditional . hijab, al-Amira or head scarf rather than cover their entire face with a full . burqa or niqab. Survey: Chart shows how people from seven different countries with a majority-Muslim population believe women should dress . Researchers asked respondents to pick their favoured style of female Muslim dress from a chart, assembled by the Pew Research Center, showing a range of clothing from the full burka (see image one on the chart above) and niqab (see image two) to types of hijabs (image four and five) to no head covering at all (image six). The majority of those questioned - 57 per cent in Tunisia, 52 per cent in Egypt, 46 per cent in Turkey and 44 per cent in Iraq - believed the white hiqab or basic al-Amira (shown in image four) is the most appropriate dress for a Muslim woman. But the more conservative black hijab or chador (shown in image three) was the second favourite choice of citizens in Iraq and Egypt. And a 63 per cent-majority of those polled in Saudi Arabia chose the second most conservative form of dress, a niqab, which is depicted in image two. Overall, the majority of those questioned across the seven Muslim-majority countries prefer women to cover their hair with a hijab, pictured left, rather than cover their face with a full burka, pictured right . Talking point: What Muslim women should or shouldn't wear has been the subject of heated debate the wold over, including Luton in the UK, pictured . It was a similar response in Pakistan where more than 60 per cent overall opted for choices two or three while 25 per cent went for the hijab worn in image four. Only in Lebanon and Turkey did a substantial proportion believe it is appropriate for women not to cover their head at all in public. Roughly a third of Turks, nearly half of those surveyed in Lebanon and 15 per cent of Tunisians agreed it is acceptable for a woman to appear in public without a head covering. Although the fact that 27 per cent of those quizzed in Lebanon were Christian may have an impact upon the results. Also the results are not broken down by gender. The majority of those questioned believed the white hiqab or basic al-amira, pictured left, is the most appropriate form of female Muslim dress.  But the niqab, pictured right, was the favoured form of dress in Saudi Arabia .","Survey was carried out in Tunisia, Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Turkey which all have a majority Muslim population .

"Looming above the Place Vendome in Paris is a seemingly innocuous 24ft tall green inflatable Christmas tree, created by American artist Paul McCarthy. But the artwork, simple entitled 'Tree', has raised eyebrows in the French capital because of its uncanny resemblance to a certain type of sex toy.

It added: 'This is where your tax dollars are going!' 'Standing at 24.4 metres tall Place Vendome Tree by Paul McCarthy is a thought sculpture specifically for this place in relation to the exhibition Chocolate Factory presented at the Monnaie de Paris, the first major solo exhibition of the artist in the city,' says the French art site Artistik Rezo. The sculpture is accompanied by a gallery where the visitor is welcomed by a forest of similarly suspiciously-shaped Christmas trees, culminating in a room full of chocolate figurines, including some of Santa holding - perhaps unsurprisingly - the same sexually suggestive symbol.

"Homeland Security boss Janet Napolitano is facing a mega lawsuit from an official who claims she gave a less-qualified woman with whom she has a 'long-standing relationship' a job over him. The suit also accuses Napolitano of turning the department into a female-run 'frat house' where male staffers were routinely humiliated and on the receiving end of 'sexually charged games'. Napolitano's chief of staff Suzanne Barr repeatedly targeted men because of their gender and once called a male employee's hotel room to use sexually explicit language, the suit claims. 'Favourite': A lawsuit has claimed that Homeland Security boss Janet Napolitano (right) gave Dora Schriro (left) a promotion over more qualified men due to their 'long-standing relationship' James T. Hayes Jr., a special . agent in charge of New York City investigations for Immigration and . Customs Enforcement, filed the lawsuit in Washington, the New York Post reported. He claims Napolitano favoured Dora Schriro, who had worked as director of the Arizona Department of Corrections when Napolitano was governor of the state, for a job due to their relationship. Hayes first worked as a border patrol agent in 1995 and then served as director of ICE Detention and Removal Operations in Washington, DC, but was demoted after Napolitano's appointment, he claims. In February 2009, she appointed Schriro as a 'special adviser' and began pushing him out of meetings, the lawsuit says. Hayes claims that Schriro, who is now commissioner of the city Department of .

'Schriro enjoyed a long-standing relationship with the secretary.' The lawsuit does not outline the exact nature of the relationship between Napolitano and the woman she brought with her to Washington from Arizona. It has long been rumoured that 'Big Sis' Napolitano is a lesbian, but in 2002 she publicly denied the claims. Schriro is a widow; she was married . for just 10 months in 1991 before her husband, St Louis's director of . public safety Gay Carraway, died of cancer. He was 20 years her senior. She has previously gushed about how . much she looks up to Napolitano, naming her as one of her greatest . influences - alongside her late husband and grandparents. 'Janet Napolitano is one of the . smartest people I’ve ever met,' she told Education Update. 'She's . totally capable of having a great time wherever she is and regardless of . the workload.' Denial: The suit does not outline the nature of the relationship. Napolitano, pictured, has denied she is gay . In the suit Hayes also accused Napolitano’s . chief of staff at ICE, Suzanne Barr, of repeated 'sexually offensive . behaviour' intended to 'humiliate and intimidate male employees'. On one occasion, Barr called a colleague in his hotel room and screamed using sexually explicit language, telling him she 'wanted his c*** in the back of [her] throat'. Hayes claims he 'felt that he was being targeted because of his gender' and witnessed Barr repeatedly picking on men. She 'created a frat-house type atmosphere that is targeted to humiliate and intimidate male employees', according to court papers. In 2009 she 'removed the entire contents of the offices of three male employees, including nameplates, computers and telephones, to the men’s bathroom at ICE headquarters'. 'Frat house': Napolitano's department became a workplace where men were regularly humiliated, it is claimed . Once she took a male special agent's work phone and messaged his female supervise 'indicating that the male employee had a crush on the female supervisor and fantasized about her', it says. The suit adds: 'Further, Barr promoted and otherwise rewarded those male employees who play along with her sexually charged games.' Hayes is seeking relief for $335,000 in damages. ICE Director of Public Affairs Brian Hale told the New York Post: 'ICE doesn’t comment on unfounded claims and will respond to Mr. Hayes’ allegations as appropriate through the judicial system.' Robin Campbell, press secretary for the New York City Department of Correction, added: 'Commissioner Schriro’s selection and service at DHS was based on the merits. Any suggestion to the contrary is false.'","Department of Homeland Security boss faces discrimination lawsuit .

"Their willingness to betray their country to the Soviet Union earned them great notoriety. But according to their KGB handlers, the Cambridge Five were a bunch of drunkards who could not be relied upon to keep a secret. The damning assessment of the university spy ring recruited in the 1930s is revealed in the Mitrokhin Archive, a file of top secret Soviet documents  being made available to the public for the first time today. The file contains profiles of around 200 British KGB collaborators and is highly critical of two of the Cambridge Five, Guy Burgess (left) and Donald Maclean (right) The file contains profiles of around 200 British KGB collaborators and is highly critical of two of the Cambridge Five, Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean. ‘Burgess does not dress tidily and is constantly under the influence of alcohol,’ Russian translator Svetlana Lokhova wrote. ‘Once on his way out of a pub, he managed to drop one of the files of [top secret] documents he had taken from the Foreign Office on the pavement.’ The file says Maclean too went through ‘drunk spells’ and was ‘not very good at keeping secrets’. During one binge, he told one of his lovers and his brother about his work for the KGB, leaving his paymasters in despair. Kim Philby was part of the Cambridge Five . The archive was compiled by KGB Major Vasili Mitrokhin, who defected to Britain in 1992 and  contains more than 30 years of Soviet secrets. The FBI called it the ‘most complete and extensive intelligence ever received from  any source’. The archive reveals the extent of the betrayal by the Cambridge Five – Communist sympathisers recruited as students by the KGB who rose to senior positions in the Foreign Office and the secret services and passed secrets to Russia throughout the Second World War and Cold War. As well as Burgess, Maclean and Kim Philby, who all eventually fled to Moscow, they included Anthony Blunt and a fifth man thought to be John Cairncross. Burgess alone handed over 389 documents to the KGB in the first six months of 1945 and a further 168 in December 1949. Just before the end of the war, Philby became head of Britain’s anti-Soviet section, meaning that the man charged with running operations against the Kremlin was a KGB agent. Mitrokhin – who tried to defect to the U.S., only to find that the CIA did not trust him – walked into the British embassy in Riga, Latvia, in 1992 carrying his archive. He looked more like a homeless man rather than a senior KGB officer but a young female diplomat saw through his dishevelled appearance and alerted MI6 to his potential before, in typical British style, offering him a cup of tea. Agents arrived and started rifling through files buried beneath his dirty underwear in a suitcase. They soon realised that she had secured one of the greatest intelligence hauls in history. As well as Burgess, Maclean and Kim Philby, the Cambridge Five also included Anthony Blunt (left) and a fifth man thought to be John Cairncross (right) Just before the end of the war, Philby became head of Britain's anti-Soviet section, meaning that the man charged with running operations against the Kremlin (pictured) was a KGB agent . Mitrokhin had spent years secretly compiling his archive after becoming disillusioned with the Soviet regime. Professor Christopher Andrew, the only historian to be allowed previous access to the files, said: ‘The risks he took reflect the genuine beliefs he held.’ Mitrokhin died in 2004. The papers, which were kept at a secret location until his family released them – with some information redacted – are now at the Churchill Archives Centre in Cambridge.","According to KGB the Cambridge Five were a bunch of drunkards .

"Almost three times as many schoolgirls as previously thought were seized from an exam hall by violent Islamist extremists, it has been claimed. A statement by officials had said that 85 girls aged 16-18, who were sitting a physics exam, were kidnapped from the school in Chibok, Nigeria last week. But today the governor of the region, who visited the town today, said that grief-stricken parents told him officials had ignored them when drawing up the list of 85, and that in fact 234 girls had been taken. Attacks: A heavy military presence in the Borno region of Nigeria did not prevent the kidnapping (file photo) Security officials had warned Gov. Kashim Shettima that it was too dangerous for him to drive to Chibok, 80 miles from Maiduguri, the Borno state capital and birthplace of the Boko Haram terrorist network blamed for the abductions. The discrepancy in the drastically different figures could not immediately be resolved. Borno state education commission Musa Inuwo Kubo and the principal of the Chibok Government Girls Secondary School had initially said that 129 science students were at the school to write a physics exam when the abductors struck, after midnight on April 14. Twenty-eight pupils escaped from their captors between Tuesday and Friday. Then another 16 were found to be day scholars who had returned to their homes in Chibok before the attack. That left 85 missing students, according to school officials. This latest confusion comes after the military had reported last week that all but eight of those abducted had been rescued - but then retracted the claim the following day. Security sources have said they are in 'hot pursuit' of the abductors, but so far they have not rescued any of the girls and young women, aged between 16 and 18. Attack: The militants struck in Chibok, in northwestern Nigeria, last month . Parents and other town residents have joined the search for the students in the Sambisa Forest which borders Chibok town and is a known hideout for the militants. The kidnappings are believed to have been carried out by Nigeria's Islamic extremist rebels, known as Boko Haram. Boko Haram - the nickname means 'Western education is sinful' - is violently campaigning to establish an Islamic Shariah state in Nigeria, whose 170 million people are about half Muslim and half Christian. Boko Haram has been abducting some girls and young women in attacks on schools, villages and towns but last week's mass kidnapping is unprecedented. The extremists use the young women as porters, cooks and sex slaves, according to Nigerian officials. Boko Haram was on a rampage last week, staging four attacks in three days that began with a massive explosion during rush hour at a busy bus station Monday morning in Abuja, the capital in the center of the country, which killed at least 75 people and wounded 141. Nigeria's military and government had claimed to have the militants on the run and contained in a remote northeast corner on the border with Cameroon. But extremist attacks have increased in frequency and become ever deadlier this year with more than 1,500 people killed so far, compared to an estimated 3,600 between 2010 and 2013.","Girls aged 16-18 were seized from an exam hall in Chibok, Nigeria .

"It looks like Santa has got his work cut out this Christmas. These astounding pictures show staff at a huge, real-life grotto preparing for the busiest online shopping days of the year. But rather than working in Lapland, they are busy at a plant in Rugeley, Staffordshire run by internet shopping firm Amazon, which yesterday, Black Friday, received an order about every 35 seconds. The enormous scale of Amazon's Christmas operation is evident from this picture of its warehouse in Staffs, which delivers toys, games and electronic equipment . The massive warehouse is the only one of Amazon's UK distribution centres which doesn't sell books. On average it will receive an order once every 35 seconds . Eager beavers: Amazon's hard-working staff are filling box after box of items bought on Black Friday - where Britons are likely to spend more than £200million . Staff were in overdrive as they packaged and distributed thousands of products for yesterday's sale, which, along with next week's Cyber Monday, are the two busiest online shopping days of the year. The American tradition was introduced by Amazon to Britain in 2010, giving bargain-hunters discounts of up to 40 per cent on more than 1,000 products, which the retail giant says is more than twice as many as last year. 5million is the combined square footage of Amazon's eight distribution depots . 2.1million products sold last Cyber Monday . 10,000 seasonal workers drafted in to cope with demand . 1,000 discounted products on sale . 99.9 per cent of parcels will arrive on time for Christmas . 35 seconds between orders expected today and Monday . 9pm is the peak ordering time . 2 miles worth of conveyor belts process orders in each depot . The name of the shopping frenzy is believed to represent retailers moving into profit after nine months in the red. The huge savings will continue on Cyber Monday, which last year saw Amazon receive orders for more than three million items. The Staffordshire 'fulfillment centre' is one of eight Amazon depots in Britain and sells a mixture of books, toys, games and electronic products. Despite the demand for gadgets and e-books, the company says sales of physical are actually increasing, despite industry-wide figures showing an 11 per cent slump for the first quarter of this year. The depot houses five-storeys of shelves which contain more than five million items over 500,000sqft. Products are scanned and sorted within 12 hours of hitting the warehouse, before an army of pickers scour the shelves collecting customer orders at the command of their hand-held scanners. Conveyor belts take these orders down to a team of 'packing associates', who then box and get them ready for shipping, which takes place at five times through the day. Although its distribution centres currently rely on manpower, earlier this year Amazon struck a deal with robot-maker Kiva Systems that will see the depots automated in the future. The has a further three warehouses planned for the coming year. British shoppers are expected to splurge £200million on bargains today, which experts say will smash records and boost struggling businesses. Orders come in so fast that there is no time to put many products on shelves. Instead they are put on huge pallets in an area known as 'mass land' Workers are required round-the-clock to meet the phenomenal demand for Christmas gifts at Amazon's eight UK distribution centres . The delivery firm will draft in an extra 1,000 workers at its depot, who will help process about 1,000tonnes of goods on Black Friday . Professor Joshua Bamfield, director of the Centre for Retail Research, said: 'Our consumer research shows most families have started thinking about Christmas this week. 'Now Black Friday is crossing the Atlantic, the amount spent on UK internet shopping on Friday could increase 10 per cent, with Amazon sales increasing by up to 30 per cent. 'Some people order early to guarantee delivery by Christmas and we’re sure internet shopping will be up on Friday - and that will be a bonus for some struggling retailers.'

"Sir Robert Edwards, the ‘father of IVF’ whose discovery helped millions of infertile couples have children, died yesterday aged 87. Together with fellow Briton Patrick Steptoe, the Nobel Prize-winner pioneered the in vitro fertilisation technique that led to the birth of Louise Brown, the world’s first test-tube baby, on July 25, 1978. The birth at Oldham General Hospital captured the imagination of the world after it was reported exclusively by the Daily Mail under the headline ‘And here she is . . . the Lovely Louise’. With more than five million IVF babies born since, friends and colleagues said the modest Yorkshireman was a ‘true giant of the 20th century’. Around 180,000 IVF babies are born in Britain each year. IVF pioneer Professor Sir Robert Edwards has died aged 87 after a long illness . Professor Peter Braude, Emeritus . Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at King’s College London, said: . ‘Few biologists have so positively and practically impacted on . humankind. ‘Bob’s boundless energy, his . innovative ideas, and his resilience despite the relentless criticism by . naysayers, changed the lives of millions of ordinary people who now . rejoice in the gift of their own child. ‘He leaves the world a much better place.’ Other experts in the fields of fertility compared him to pioneers such as Charles Darwin and Albert Einstein. Dr Allan Pacey, chair of the British . Fertility Society (BFS), which represents IVF clinics, said: ‘His work . transformed our view of infertility from something that must be endured . to a potentially treatable medical condition. He will be greatly missed . and his contribution to humankind is immeasurable. ‘It is heartening to know that he . received due acclaim for his work during his lifetime. The BFS considers . his legacy to match that of Darwin, Curie and Einstein for their . respective fields, and hopes his memory will live on for many years to . come.’ Pioneering: Sir Robert's work resulted in the first test-tube baby, Louise Brown, who was born on 25 July 1978, in Oldham, Greater Manchester . Sir Robert, a father of five and a . fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge, was awarded the Nobel Prize for . Medicine in 2010 and knighted the following year. After Miss Brown was born, Sir Robert and Dr Steptoe celebrated their achievement by drinking champagne out of plastic cups. He remained in touch with Miss Brown . throughout the ensuing years, and later attended her wedding to Wesley . Mullinder. And in 2006, she gave birth to her son Cameron, who was . conceived naturally. Miss Brown, 34, last night joined the . tributes to Sir Robert. She said: ‘It was really sad to hear the news . today. I have always regarded Robert Edwards as like a grandfather to . me. The Mail's report of the story in 1978 . Lesley Brown made medical history nearly 35 years ago when she gave birth to Louise, the world’s first test-tube baby. The event stunned the medical world and marked the start of a revolution in fertility treatment. Mrs Brown and her husband, John, had been trying for a baby for nine years when they signed up to an experimental procedure, in vitro fertilisation. She became pregnant at the first attempt, and 5lb 12oz Louise Joy Brown was born by caesarean section at Oldham General Hospital at 11.47pm on July 25, 1978. The birth, which gave hope to countless infertile couples, captured the imagination of the world after it was reported exclusively by the Daily Mail. The treatment involved an egg being removed from one of Mrs Brown’s ovaries with a probe before being mixed with her husband’s sperm in a petri dish – not a test tube. The resulting embryo was implanted in her womb two days later. The Vatican said the treatment could have ‘grave consequences for humanity’ and even James Watson, the DNA pioneer, warned that the scientists were dabbling in infanticide. Some feared the baby would be abnormal. Although other women had been implanted with fertilised eggs, this was the first pregnancy to go beyond a few weeks. Four years later, Mrs Brown, who couldn’t become pregnant naturally because her fallopian tubes were blocked, conceived a second daughter, Natalie, by IVF. Last June, Lesley Brown died suddenly aged 64 at Bristol Royal Infirmary after developing septicaemia while being treated in hospital for gallstones. Her husband died from lung cancer nearly six years ago. Louise, 34, wed nightclub doorman Wesley Mullinder in 2004, with Sir Robert in attendance, and in 2006 had her son Cameron, who was conceived naturally. ‘His work, along with Patrick . Steptoe, has brought happiness and joy to millions of people all over . the world by enabling them to have children. ‘I am glad that he lived long enough to be recognised with a Nobel Prize for his work. ‘His legacy will live on with all the IVF work being carried out throughout the world. ‘The thoughts of myself and my sister Natalie, who was also born through IVF, are with his family at this sad time.’ Her mother, Lesley Brown, was unable . to conceive naturally because her fallopian tubes were blocked and had . been trying for a baby for nine years when she signed up to what was . then an experimental procedure. The work of Sir Robert (left) and Patrick Steptoe (right), has brought happiness to millions of people all over the world by enabling them to have children . Sir Robert attended Ms Brown's wedding and . visited her regularly . A father figure: Robert became an honorary member of the Brown family according to test tube baby Louise (right) pictured here with son Cameron and late mother Lesley. As well as giving birth to Louise in . 1978, she had a second daughter, Natalie, using IVF four years later. Mrs Brown died last year. Born in 1925 into a working class . family in Batley, West Yorkshire, Sir Robert studied agriculture at . Bangor University before switching to zoology as a mature student . following his military service in the Second World War. He started research on IVF in the . Fifties and was driven by the belief that people had the right to . receive help in having a family. He once said: ‘I have seen how . infertility is a cause of great and lasting human sadness. It demands . treatment. The most important thing in life is having a child.’ However, the research he conducted . with Dr Steptoe, who died in 1988, on artificial reproduction was . bitterly opposed by the medical establishment and religious leaders and . they were forced to seek private donations to fund their experiments. Early efforts failed due to flawed . hormone treatments. But in 1977 the pair tried a new procedure, which . avoided hormone treatments and instead relied on precise timing. A year . later, Louise was born. The Daily Mail’s then editor, Sir . David English, helped them to acquire Bourn Hall, near Cambridge, where . in 1980 they established the world’s first IVF clinic. Mike Macnamee, . chief executive of the Bourn Hall Clinic, said: ‘Bob Edwards is one of . our greatest scientists. His inspirational work in the early Sixties led . to a breakthrough that has enhanced the lives of millions of people . worldwide. He is held in great affection by everyone who has worked with . him and was treated by him. Sir Robert Edwards seen here at the Bourn Hall IVF Clinic in 2008 with Louise Brown and her son Cameron .

Scientists leading tributes today said 'few could say their work has impacted on mankind in such a meaningful way' ‘For me personally, Bob was a great . mentor, colleague and friend. It was a privilege to work with him, and . his passing is a great loss to us all.’  Professor Lisa Jardine, chair . of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), which . licences IVF clinics and research, said: ‘It is with great sadness that . we have heard about the death of Professor Sir Robert Edwards. ‘Few scientists can say that their . work has impacted on mankind in such a meaningful way. He was an . exceptional man whose compassion and tenacity will be dearly missed.’ The award of the Nobel Prize – and . prize money of nearly £1million to Sir Robert when it finally came in . 2010 – was considered by many to be long overdue. Although the official reason for the . long delay is not known, it has been suggested that Miss Brown giving . birth to a healthy child played a significant part in the decision. Nobel committee member Christer Hoog . said: ‘It was of course very, very important that Louise Brown was . healthy and that subsequent babies also were healthy.’ Sir Robert’s death followed a long illness. He leaves his wife Ruth, five daughters and 12 grandchildren.","Sir Robert's work resulted in the first IVF baby, Louise Brown, born in 1978 .

"Juan Mata’s relationship with Jose Mourinho had sunk so low that he had no option but to leave Chelsea after the pair stopped speaking. The Spain midfielder cost Manchester United £37.1million in January and has revealed there was ‘no dialogue’ with his manager at Stamford Bridge. It marked a sorry end for Mata, who was widely adored in west London and had scooped the club’s fans’ and players’ Player of the Year awards the previous season. Jose Mourinho (left) and Juan Mata weren't on speaking terms before the latter left Chelsea last season . Spaniard Mata eventually left for Manchester United in a £37.1million move back in January . Manager Louis van Gaal has drawn lavish praise from Mata in an interview with El Pais on Monday . ‘For better or for worse, we had no relationship, there was no dialogue,’ Mata told El Pais. ‘I was not happy, but always gave the most respected and my colleagues. You never know what will happen in life.’ For a man usually so reserved, it is a damning character assassination. The 26-year-old hasn’t properly clicked into gear at Old Trafford just yet, although Louis van Gaal has found it easier to engineer more consistent performances than predecessor David Moyes. Mata – in direct contrast to his forthright criticism for Mourinho – praised the Dutchman highly as United attempt to claw their way back into the Champions League. ‘He [Van Gaal] has so much experience and I can learn a lot from him. He’s tough when he has to be. ‘He says things in a firm way, intensely, but then he’s somebody who is very close with the players. He really likes to talk with us, to ask us what we think about the exercises that we do in training.’ They are comments which could be construed as more than a thinly-veiled dig at Mourinho. Mata has won the players' and fans' Player of the Year awards at Chelsea before leaving the club . Spain Under 21 midfielder Ander Herrera (centre) lives on the same street as Mata in the North West . Mata does appear to have settled in the north – labelling Manchester as ‘the real England’. Hardly surprising, given he lives on the same street as Spanish team-mates David de Gea and Ander Herrera. ‘De Gea told me that at first it was difficult because I did not know the language,’ he added. ‘When I got [here, he] helped me a lot and now we take a hand [to] Ander, with whom I have a very close relationship because our way of interpreting life is similar. ‘We spend almost every day together.’ It was a candid interview, in which the former Valencia playmaker also asserted that he's undervalued in his homeland after playing just once for Spain this calendar year. 'Maybe I feel my values more in England than in Spain,' he added. 'Now I have not [been] mentioned, but am not looking for excuses or justifications.' Like our Manchester United Facebook page.

"Bodies of African immigrants have been found washed up on shores 30 miles east of Tripoli. It comes after nearly 200 migrants were feared to have drowned after a boat sank less than a mile from the coast of Libya during an attempted crossing to mainland Europe. The small vessel - which was crammed with men, women and children - sank late on Friday, according to the local coast guard. Scroll down for video . Bodies of African would-be migrants are washed up on the shore of al-Qarboli, 30 miles east of Tripoli, Libya . Rescue workers pull the bodies of illegal immigrants onto shore of al-Qarbole .

It . comes as Italy's maritime search and rescue team are being called upon . to retrieve hundreds of migrants who are trying to flee North Africa via . the Mediterranean Sea on a daily basis. A Libyan coastguard spokesman Abdellatif Mohammed Ibrahim said: 'A few miles off the coast, we found the remains of a wooden boat which had some 200 migrants on board. 'We managed to save 16 people and recovered 15 bodies, but the search continues for some 170 people who disappeared at sea.' He added: 'It seems that among them are Somalis and Eritreans in addition to other nationalities. One of the fatalities was an 18-month-old child.'

A body  is discovered in the water one mile off the coast of Libya after a vessel crammed with migrants sank . Around 3,500 migrants and 19 corpses have been discovered since Friday during a spate of attempted journeys by traffickers trying to take advantage of calmer summer seas. The Italian ship Sirio recovered 18 corpses and 73 survivors from a raft, after a frigate picked up one corpse along with 1372 survivors on Friday night. The Mare Nostrum search and rescue mission began after a shipwreck near Italy's coast killed 366 people last October. More than 200 passengers are feared to have drowned in a desperate attempt to make it to Europe . The mission costs around 9 million euros (£7.5 million) a month and has sparked fierce debate in Italy, which slipped back into recession in the second quarter after years of stagnation. A breakdown of order in Libya since the toppling of Colonel Gaddafi has been exploited by human traffickers, pushing the number of arrivals into Italy since January past 100,000. At the frontier between Europe and Africa, Italy has long attracted seaborne migrants, but the number of arrivals this year is already above a previous record of just over 60,000 for all of 2011, when the Arab Spring uprisings fuelled migration. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has called on the European Union to take responsibility for rescuing migrants by investing in border control agency Frontex, and on the United Nations to intervene in Libya to manage the flows of refugees. A shoe belonging to an illegal immigrant floats on the water after the boat carrying men, women and children sank.

Climate change minister Lady Verma said it was an ‘important’ issue and urged the public to ‘moderate our behaviour’. People should eat baked beans less often to reduce the impact on the environment, the House of Lords heard . Concerns have previously been raised about the effect of methane emissions from cows on global warming. But in the House of Lords today a Labour peer raised questions about the impact of human diet on emmisions. Viscount Simon, 73, a Labour peer who has been a member of the House of Lords for more than 20 years, voiced his fears about the ‘smelly emissions’. Lord Simon said: ‘In a programme some months ago on the BBC it was stated that this country has the largest production of baked beans and the largest consumption of baked beans in the world.’ He asked Lady Verma: ‘Could you say whether this affects the calculation of global warming by the Government as a result of the smelly emission resulting therefrom?’ Lady Verma described his question as . ‘so different’ but she appeared to suggest that people should think . twice about over-indulging in baked beans or any food which causes . flatulence. She added: ‘You do actually raise a very important point, which is we do need to moderate our behaviour.' Viscount Simon, a hereditary Labour peer, said he was concerned about 'smelly emissions' A study last December suggested the total value of baked beans sold in the previous year had fallen by £20.8 million to £339.3 million in the UK. Lord Simon's grandfather Sir John Simon, a Liberal, was given a peerage in 1940 after serving as Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary and Chancellor. A study this week recommended eating baked beans every day, to help significantly reduce cholesterol and lower the risk of heart diseases. Wind and bloating were among the side effects of those eating the daily portion, although this subsided after a while, said lead researcher Dr John Sievenpiper from St Michael’s Hospital, Toronto. Last month a survey found that tins of baked beans were the most popular item that Brits took with them when going on foreign holidays. Climate change minister Baroness Verma said people must moderate their behaviour . Baked beans was the most popular item at 37 per cent, followed by chocolate (35 per cent), Bacon (32 per cent), sweets (24 per cent), and condiments (20 per cent). The exchange over the impact of beans on global warming came as a senior Tory peer called on the government to stop trying to prevent climate change altogether. George Osborne’s father-in-law Lord Howell of Guildford, a former Foreign Office minister, said a change in direction of energy policy was ‘overdue’. The Tory peer said in the House of Lords: ‘Now may be time to consider switching our colossal expenditure in attempting mitigation to adaptation to what is widely believed by many of us to come in the way of more extreme weather. ‘It seems that our current mitigation efforts seem to be producing no vast improvement in carbon emissions - in fact an increase in our carbon footprint - burning more coal, increased fuel poverty, driving investment away from this country to elsewhere where power is cheaper, raising the prospect of blackouts and general environmental damage.’ At question time in the Lords he asked energy minister Baroness Verma: ‘Isn't it becoming very obvious that some change of direction in our climate and energy policy is overdue if we are to achieve our green goals?’ Lady Verma said the Government's policy was about ‘both adaptation and mitigation’. Labour peer Baroness Worthington said: ‘On discovering a flood in a bathroom you would not make your priority turning your house into a swimming pool, you would turn the tap off. ‘That is precisely what we need to do and I think it is regrettable that we have some prominent members of the other side (Conservatives) who do not seem to accept it.’","Labour peer Viscount Simon raises fears about impact of flatulence .

"A 41-year-old mother-of-two who was caught on camera ransacking a Florida McDonald's wearing nothing but a thong has spoken out about her rampage, saying she does not remember anything about the incident but was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time. Sandra Suarez is alleged to have offered a restaurant worker oral sex in the parking lot of the Pinellas Park store on March 24, with the subsequent rejection causing her to flip out, police said. CCTV footage of her reign of destruction - including destroying a register, throwing around equipment and eating soft serve straight from the dispenser - surfaced this week after two employees posted it online. Both have now been fired. No memory: Sandra Suarez, 41, says she's not recall flipping out inside a Pinellas Park McDonald's and has blamed her behavior on Bipolar disorder . Rude: Sandra Suarez was caught on camera going berserk inside the Florida McDonald's, with the footage posted online by an employee, who was fired as a result . Self serve: After no one offers to give her whatever it is she wants, the woman decides to serve herself . According to Fox 13, Suarez was arrested and immediately sent for a medical examination, with a doctor telling police she was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Suarez was interviewed on Tuesday by Fox 13 under the provision she didn't have to speak on camera. She blamed the tirade on bipolar disorder. Suarez was charged with criminal mischief and resisting arrest, then was released on $7,000 bond. The video has gone viral and is narrated by the now-terminated McDonald's employees, who were watching it after the fact on the store's security cameras. 'This woman is my new role model,' joked one employee. Restaurant owner Juan Illas said 'posting of the video was without authorization and inconsistent with my values and how we operate our restaurant'.

"The witness was suggested to be a ""compulsive liar"" and a ""wicked woman"" by defence barrister Tayyab Khan. (Picture posed by model) A judge was forced to intervene after a barrister tried to force an alleged victim of child-sex grooming to read out graphic details of her alleged abuse. The witness, suggested to be a 'compulsive liar' and a 'wicked woman' by defence barrister Tayyab Khan, is one of seven alleged victims in a sex exploitation trial at Stafford Crown Court. But the 19-year-old, who cannot be named, left the stand in tears as she was asked to read out her account of an alleged sexual assault on her by her step-father - unrelated to the sex exploitation trial - that she made to police in 2005. The teenager was . asked why she had retracted her claim her step-father raped her when she was 13. She . said when she told her mother, the allegation was reported to police, . but she retracted it a day later to protect her 'because I didn't want . my mum to be upset', the jury was told. The alleged victim, the third of the seven alleged victims to give . evidence at the three month trial, insisted it was not a false . allegation, according to The Times. Mr Khan suggested she had invented the story and asked her to read out details of the abuse she claimed to have suffered. Crying, she read out a section of her account, and broke down a second time. On the stand: The witness is one of seven alleged victims in a sex exploitation trial at Stafford Crown Court pictured . After some members of the jury shook their heads at her distress, judge Robin Onions stepped in and said: 'It's extremely painful for the witness, Mr Khan. Why can't . you read it to her?' Later, Mr Khan said: 'You are a compulsive liar. You have told lies about my client, also?' The lawyer said she had told lies about his client, 23-year-old Ahdel Ali, who with his brother Mubarek Ali, 28, is accused of arranging her prostitution in 2008 and 2009. Seven men from Telford have denied more than 50 charges relating to sexual exploitation and child prostitution. The teenager claims Ali took her to have sex with two workers at a Wellington restaurant. According to the BBC, the witness said: 'Were you there? You don't know anything. He did take me to the restaurant.' She began to cry and swore at Mr Khan when she was asked about a separate incident in 2009 involving a middle-aged Asian man. After returning to the stand, the teenager said she had punched the man when he 'tried to put his hand up my mate's top.' Mr Khan said the man had been supplying the girls with alcohol but the witness had threatened to make a rape claim against him when he refused to give them any more. Mr Khan then branded the witness a 'very wicked woman' and suggested she had invented malicious allegations. She denied that she had made any false allegations. The other five defendants in the trial are Noshad Hussain, 21, Mohammed Ali Sultan, 24; Tanveer Ahmed, 39; Mahroof Khan, 33; and Mohammed Islam Choudhrey, 52. The men live in the Wellington and Sutton Hill areas of Telford and deny charges related to incidents alleged to have happened between 2007 and 2009. The trial continues.

"The co-founder of a New York law firm that represented thousands of first responders and workers affected by 9/11 has accused his partner of using prostitutes and having a liason with a receptionist. Paul Napoli, 46, whose affair with colleague Vanessa Denis was recently exposed as part of an on-going legal dispute, made the claims against Marc Bern. Their firm Napoli Bern has raked in billions of dollars representing diet-pill users and workers who helped clear up the Ground Zero site. Allegations: Paul Napoli, 46, whose affair with colleague Vanessa Denis was recently exposed, made the claims against his law firm partner Marc Bern (right) In continuous attacks, Napoli said Bern's behavior were 'unbecoming of a lawyer' and also accused him of charging fancy dinners and plane trips to Aspen on the corporate credit. He said Bern had oral sex with the employee during a Christmas party, according to the New York Post. After the allegations came out and Napoli was diagnosed with leukemia in May, Bern took over the finances of the firm and said he found some 'horrific irregularities', his lawyer said in court. Napoli, who was diagnosed with leukemia in May, also allegedly sent an email around the office suggesting Bern had neglected his son - who died of a drug overdose in 2010. In October the situation worsened when Napoli sued his partner for breach of contract. He then, according to court papers, tried to 'hurt anyone he perceives as being allied with Marc Bern against him.' Bern’s lawyer, Clifford Robert, told the Post: 'Paul and Marie Napoli’s transparent attempts to divert attention away from the very serious claims against them are unfortunate.' In April 2013, Mrs Napoli, 47, hired a private investigator to spy on her husband and Dennis during a Chicago business trip. Vanessa Dennis, (right) one of the young lawyers at the firm, court papers allege, and when his wife, Marie, (left) discovered it, she stalked and harassed the woman . The suit claims she then emailed the young associate, saying, 'I have evidence that is going to be forwarded to your husband if you do not stay away from my husband.' Mr Napoli demanded Dennis erase correspondence between the pair and admitted he had authorized access for his wife to see both his and Dennis' e-mail accounts, state legal papers. Court papers say Mrs Napoli messaged Dennis' brother to tell him of the affair and then found Dennis' husband, Richard Buonauito, in Dennis' personnel file as an emergency contact and contacted him. The 33-year-old was fired from Napoli Bern on May 2, 2013, with a $150,000 severance. But Mrs Napoli allegedly did not stop the harassment and e-mailed Dennis writing: 'Happy Mothers Day! Oh yea I should say happy motherless day. Tick tock.' Dennis had previously told Mr Napoli that she might not be able to have conceive. The Napolis have three young children - including a baby. In June 2013 an email included in court papers shows an angry Dennis wrote to Mr Napoli: 'What's more believable Paul — that a 32-year-old junior attorney who weighs 100 pounds soaking wet seduced and physically attacked her 40 something year old boss (who happens to be a managing partner and a millionaire) and twice her size or the other way around. Mr Napoli is a partner at Napoli Bern which raked in billions of dollars representing diet-pill users and workers at Ground Zero . She emailed him again to remind him of intimate details he had shared about his view of his wife's body since she became a mother. Dennis, who has since split with her husband, moved to Texas, but she claims Mrs Napoli sent  cards to the wives of Dennis' new bosses, warning them about her and even describing Dennis' private body piercing. She also sent messages to everyone on LinkedIn associated with Dennis' new firm. Dennis claims that in one day she came out the bathroom of her Houston apartment to find her back door open and her cat, Padme, missing - she says she received a series of texts written as if from Padme, with one saying, 'How do u think I got out . . .' Three months later Dennis filed a defamation suit in state Supreme Court against the Napolis, Marc Bern and Napoli Bern with preliminary paperwork indicates she is seeking at least $9 million. She declined to comment when contacted by the Post and Mr Napoli said he saw nothing wrong 'with confronting a person that there was an affair with.' 'Everything my wife said in any e-mail whether it sounds terrible or not was all true and was all factually correct.' He denied reports he had previous affairs at the firm and denied that his wife had killed Dennis' cat. The couple, who have met at St. John’s University School of Law, briefly split up, but are now back together - they live on Long Island . A Facebook photo shows Mrs Napoli kissing her husband in Mexico's Cancun this year . The couple, who have met at St. John’s University School of Law, briefly split up, but are now back together - they live on Long Island. A Facebook photo shows Mrs Napoli kissing her husband in Mexico's Cancun this year - the couple are outlined in a heart. Last week Mrs Napoli filed her own legal action, claiming Dennis enticed her husband into having sex on the Chicago business trip in violation of the 'Illinois Alienation of Affections Act.' On his firm's website Mr Napoli's bio reads: ' Paul J. Napoli, a Senior Partner in the firm, has achieved more than 100 verdicts and settlements over one million dollars. 'He is nationally known as a tenacious and unrelenting advocate for his clients’ rights in courts around the country, where he consistently achieves results in the multiple millions of dollars for injured plaintiffs. Mr Napoli has been named in New York Super Lawyers® each year since 2007, and in 2010, was named as one of the top 100 lawyers in the New York Metropolitan area.'

"Amazon moved closer to stepping out of cyberspace after signing a lease for space across from the Empire State Building that could be the location for a planned brick-and-mortar storefront. It was reported back in October that the online retail corporation was looking to open a physical store in New York City. On Thursday, Vornado Realty Trust issued a press release  stating that Amazon had inked a 17-year lease on a 470,000 square-foot space near Herald Square. Offline: Amazon signed a lease for office and retail space across the street from the Empire State Building this week . The 12-story building is currently home to storefronts for clothing brands Express and Mango. 'We have leased this building primarily as corporate office space and we intend to sublease to other tenants the ground floor retail space,' Amazon spokesperson Kelly Cheeseman told the Huffington Post in an email. Amazon did not respond to questions about whether it planned to use the space for its own retail store. The Wall Street Journal revealed back in October that the company was quietly planning to experiment with a physical storefront in Manhattan. Speaking with unnamed sources, the Journal reported the planned location would hold a limited inventory and be more like a warehouse than a traditional retail space. Customers would be able to pick up and return items purchased online, and the location would serve as a distribution center for couriers, according to sources familiar with the plan. Curbfront: Amazon brought a truck to New York that allowed customers to demo and buy its e-readers and tablets . Empire State: The online  megastore that has long competed with brick-and-mortar bookstores and other retailers reportedly plans to move in reverse and open a physical location . Still, at least one person that spoke to the paper stated that plans could change for the Internet retail giant.

"A boy of ten and another aged 16 have been beheaded by the Taliban for ‘spying’. The pair were seized while scavenging among rubbish bins near the police headquarters in Kandahar, Afghanistan’s second city and a key base for Western forces. They were accused of accepting food from the police in exchange for information, provincial government officials said last night. Their heads were cut off following interrogation, it is claimed. Their bodies were recovered in Kandahar’s Zhari district. Killed: Taliban fighters patrol the outskirts of Kandahar. Two boys aged 10 and 16 were beheaded by Taliban fighters beheaded today as a warning to villagers not to cooperate with the Afghan government (file photo) The officials said the boys had simply been going through bins to find food that had been thrown away by Western forces. The ten-year-old boy was very poor and . was known to take food going spare from the police to give to his . family, the officials added. Dr Toryalay Wessa, who is Kandahar’s . governor, instructed the security forces and police to hunt down and . catch the militants responsible for the killing ‘with whatever . casualties it takes and at whatever price’. Jamal Agha, the chief of Zhari district, . said: ‘The boys were on their way back when they were stopped by .

"You know how it goes: you’re trying to talk to your grandchildren, but they’re constantly checking their beeping phones. ‘I’m listening . . . ’ they insist. Except you know only too well they’re not. At home, over dinner, you want to catch up with your husband, but he’s busy checking his emails on his iPad. He says ‘Yes’ every so often but, again, his attention is obviously elsewhere. Part of you wonders who is messaging him so often. You feel a pang of mistrust; maybe you don’t even kiss him goodnight. Scroll down for video . Technology is destroying real intimacy in our relationships says Paul Levy . Then it occurs to you that you put an ‘X’ at the end of your text messages to each other more often than you kiss in real life. For many of us, this behaviour is slowly becoming the new normal. But it shouldn’t: because technology is destroying real intimacy in our relationships. I have been studying the digital world as a senior researcher at the University of Brighton since 1990, but it was six years ago when I started to notice myself spending too long on my smartphone: hours online at night and constantly responding to it in the day, even when surrounded by friends. As the quality of our physical connections gets diluted over time, we adjust, expecting less. We forget what real romance is. I realised I was beginning to get addicted — and I wasn’t the only one. So, I began studying the effects of our virtual lives on our physical relationships, and have since spoken to hundreds of couples whose partnerships have been threatened by their addiction to technology. For some, the cause is what I call ‘wretched contentment’: spending evenings watching TV, all the while constantly checking phones without talking. It’s pleasant, but it’s not fulfilling. As the quality of our physical connections gets diluted over time, we adjust, expecting less. We forget what real romance is. And we forget that sending kisses by email can’t replace actual intimacy. Studies the world over have proven the same. Researchers at the University of Missouri interviewed hundreds of Facebook users aged between 18 and 82, who believed their partner’s Facebook use increased conflict in their relationship. Even children ignore their grandparents as they are hooked to their smartphones . As the use of the site increased, the study found, so did their jealousy, leading to break-ups, cheating and divorce. The evidence is everywhere: the more we resort to digital intimacy, the less fluent our actual intimacy becomes. One couple’s relationship suffered when they were both promoted, and spent every evening answering emails from work, even at 11pm. ‘At first, we were answering emails from the bedroom,’ says Anne. ‘Which meant our sex life suffered. Then, my husband started working from the study next door instead. When he started texting me goodnight, instead of walking to the bedroom, I knew I was no longer a priority.’ An Oxford University study of 24,000 married European couples found a direct, inverse link between use of social networking sites and marital satisfaction . This distance breeds mistrust. Partners worry who their loved one is talking to — often with good reason. And an Oxford University study of 24,000 married European couples found a direct, inverse link between use of social networking sites and marital satisfaction. The more couples read about others’ exciting lives on social media, the more likely they were to view their own with disappointment and disdain. Reclaim your home. Placing smartphones and tablets away from the bedroom and the places we eat is a big step in the right direction . People can fall into ‘text’ arguments in ways they never would face-to-face. Misunderstandings are all too easy when you can’t read someone’s body language. And friendships are affected as we replace meet-ups with online communication. The more we get out of practice at being with other human beings, the scarier physical closeness becomes, chipping away at our happiness. We all need deep communication and we’re not getting it. Many children now Skype relatives more regularly, but visit them less. Most grandparents would prefer a call and a visit. Technology can be a beautiful way to keep in touch, but it should be an addition, not a replacement, to real relationships. WHAT YOU CAN DO . . . Reclaim your home. Placing smartphones and tablets away from the bedroom and the places we eat is a big step in the right direction. Use a proper alarm clock, not your phone. When you are meeting friends put your phone on ‘airplane mode’ and allow at least 20 minutes of uninterrupted communication. When you text your partner saying ‘I love you’, close your eyes, picture your partner and really feel that love. When you send someone an ‘X’ in a text, make sure you give them a kiss in real life when you get home.

"Femme fatale: Angelina Jolie lookalike Luminita Perijoc, allegedly stabbed a taxi driver after he refused to have sex with her for a third time . A Romanian taxi driver claims a sex-crazed Angelina Jolie lookalike passenger stabbed him after he refused to satisfy her for a third time. Nicolae Stan told police stunning Luminita Perijoc, 30, had already forced him at knifepoint to have intercourse and perform oral sex. He claims Perijoc had asked him to help her with his bags but once inside her apartment she demanded sex. When he refused she allegedly pulled out a knife and forced him to undress. Police investigating his claims say the Perijoc's behaviour may have been down to the fact she was on medication at the time.

"Staffers working on The Late Show with David Letterman have revealed the bizarre requests Bill Cosby would make before his appearances. Sources told the New York Daily News the 77-year-old would demand that 'young girls, interns and assistants' sit down and watch him eat curry backstage in the Green Room before the interviews. They described how no one would say anything, but the comedian allegedly would still make them stay until he finished his meal. He last appeared on the CBS talk show in January. Scroll down for video . Claims: Female staffers working behind the scenes at The Late Show with David Letterman have revealed the comedian made bizarre requests before his appearance. He was last on the sofa in January 2014 (pictured) As historic sexual assault allegations against Cosby continue to resurface, his next scheduled appearance with Letterman was cancelled. He has also recently been dropped from Queen Latifah's talk show and has not commented on the allegations during interviews. The employees told the paper that producers would make them do it because 'that’s what he (Cosby) wanted', even though they admitted not liking the pre-show scenario. The revelations come as Cosby's 'fixer' for NBC claimed that he helped the funnyman channel star funnel thousands of dollars to a virtual harem of young women he kept as the The Cosby Show was filmed. Frank Scotti, 90, told the Daily News on Sunday that he acted as a conduit through whom the actor sent lady pals funds and as a guard at Cosby's dressing room door when those women visited. After decades, Scotti's even saved receipts from money orders he says he gave those women for Cosby. One of those women, Shawn Thompson, had a daughter named Autumn Jackson who would claim Cosby was her father. Allegations: Employees claimed before Cosby went on the show he ask for 'young girls, interns and assistants' to sit down and watch him eat curry backstage before the interviews . In recent days, 15 women have gone public accusing Cosby of sexually assaulting them. His lawyer Martin Singer has said branded the stories 'increasingly ridiculous' and 'passed the point of absurdity. In a statement released on Friday, he said: 'The new, never-before-heard claims from women who have come forward in the past two weeks with unsubstantiated, fantastical stories about things they say occurred 30, 40, or even 50 years ago have escalated far past the point of absurdity. 'These brand new claims about alleged decades-old events are becoming increasingly ridiculous, and it is completely illogical that so many people would have said nothing, done nothing, and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years.' The comedian, who has been performing on stage despite the resurgence of allegations, stayed silent during a radio interview with NPR and pressured the Associated Press not to broadcast an interview where he was asked about the rape allegations. He was given two standing ovations when he appeared before an enthusiastic audience in Melbourne, Florida, on Friday night. The audience cheered as he walked on the stage and again when he completed his 90-minute performance. Moving forward: In recent days, 15 women have gone public accusing Cosby of sexually assaulting them. His lawyer Martin Singer has said branded the stories 'increasingly ridiculous' Many in the audience even shouted for an encore at the end of the show, but Cosby did not reappear. On the same day Law & Order: SVU star Michelle Hurd came forward to say that Cosby acted highly inappropriately towards her when she was a stand-in on The Cosby Show, and claimed that she knows of one woman on set who woke up drugged at his apartment. Ten women have come forward in the last month saying they were attacked by Cosby, with Renita Chaney Hill, Louisa Moritz and Andrea Leslie the latest additions. Four of the women claim they were teenagers at the time. One of the accusers is supermodel Janice Dickinson, who claims that during a dinner in 1982 the actor gave her a pill and when she woke up he was on top of her. Another four ladies; Barbara Bowman, Joan Tarshis, Tamara Green and Therese Serignese have all shared remarkably similar stories in which they claim to have shared a drink or a pill with Cosby and then woken up after or while they say he was sexually assaulting them. Also coming forward recently is Carla Ferrigno, wife of Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, who says Cosby tried to sexually assault her during a gathering at his house in 1967.","Employees claimed they would sit in silence while the comedian ate .

"Two sisters in Ohio, aged 4 and 6, who returned to the U.S. from Sierra Leone 17 days prior were rushed to a hospital around 2am Sunday over Ebola fears after spiking fevers. The unidentified Columbus girls were taken to Nationwide Children's Hospital, where they were put in isolation, but later tested negative for the dreaded tropical disease. They were in West Africa with their mother, who was not there as a healthcare worker and is not believed to be at high-risk for Ebola. Scroll down for video . Ebola? Two girls were taken to nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio early Sunday after developing possible Ebola symptoms 17 days after returning from Seirra Leone . Risks: The girls are more likely to have influenza, rather than Ebola, officials say, but their travel history means caution is needed . They were taken to the hospital by EMS staff who wore protective gear and are not considered to be at risk for Ebola. 'We are following all protocol for safety to make sure everybody at the hospital and the EMS and everyone is safe,' Jose Rodriguez, spokesman for Columbus Public Health, told the Columbus Dispatch. Rodriguez said the girls were not symptomatic on Saturday morning, when officials last checked in on them. According to Rodriguez, at least one of the girls is suffering from a cough, which is not a symptom of Ebola. 'Even though they traveled to the region, they had no known contact with a patient that was either living with or died from Ebola,' Rodriquez told 10tv.com. Spokeswoman Gina Bericchia told the Dispatch in an email that influenza is more likely to blame for the girls' illness. 'A respiratory virus is more likely to be the cause, but we must rule out Ebola,' she wrote. Results from both an influenza and Ebola test were expected sometime Sunday. Sierra Leone is one of the three affected countries along with Liberia and Guinea. Ebola has killed more than 5,000 people in West Africa. Precautions: Hospital spokesman Jose Rodriguez told reporters the girls were a low risk for Ebola but that tests are needed to confirm they're negative for the deadly virus .","The unidentified girls were taken by ambulance to Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus around 2am Saturday .

"At least five national TV journalists have met in private with the police officer responsible for the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in August. Officer Darren Wilson hasn't been seen in public - let alone interviewed - since the shooting, but he has met with the high profile television anchors to discuss the possibility of doing a televised interview at some point. While a grand jury continues to deliberate over whether to charge Wilson for shooting Brown, the officer is believed to have met with anchors including NBC’s Matt Lauer, ABC’s George Stephanopoulos, CBS’ Scott Pelley and CNN’s Anderson Cooper and Don Lemon. NBC's Matt Lauer and CNN's Anderson Cooper are among a couple of five high profile TV anchors who have spoken in secret with Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson . Within hours of his name being linked with having secret meetings with Darren Ferguson, Anderson Cooper tweeted to confirm that it had happened and was standard procedure . Wilson’s low profile since the shooting means every media organization covering the high profile story is very eager to speak to him. Speaking on his CNN Sunday morning show Reliable Sources, host Brian Stelter revealed that the five anchors had all had off-the-record conversations with the police officer and that his list was not exhaustive. ‘My sense from my sources is that it’s mostly the anchors doing the talking in these off-the-record meetings, it’s mostly Darren Wilson listening and getting to know the person, said Stelter. Soon after the program aired on Sunday, both Cooper and Lemon confirmed via Twitter that the meetings had taken place. Both were keen to explain that such meetings are a normal part of the TV guest booking process in order to establish trust and comfort with the potential interviewee. ‘For the record, I met briefly with Darren Wilson a few days ago to see if he wanted to do an interview with me. That's standard procedure,’ Cooper wrote. CNN host Don Lemon also tweeted to confirm that he had met with Darren Wilson to sound him out for a possible exclusive TV interview . Other TV anchors who've met with Wilson been named as (from left to right) CBS’ Scott Pelley, ABC’s George Stephanopoulos and CNN's Don Lemon . Cooper denied that meeting Ferguson cop Wilson was part of any conspiracy and said it was standard practice to meet with a possible interview subject prior to them agreeing to speak on camera . Cooper denied that his meeting with Wilson was part of a pro-police conspiratorially and pointed out that he'd repeatedly interviewed Michael Brown's family members and their attorneys. 'I'd also like to interview the grand jury,' Cooper wrote. 'There is no conspiracy here. Reporters want to interview people and sometimes you have to meet them first.' He added that Wilson had chosen 'not to do an interview with me.' Cooper, on Twitter, drew a comparison to another man in the news that many journalists wanted to interview earlier this year: disgraced Los Angeles Clippers team owner Donald Sterling. 'Prior to interviewing Donald Sterling, for example, I also met with him to ask him to do an interview. That's how you ask for an interview,' Cooper wrote. Officer Darren Wilson, right, hasn't been seen in public - let alone interviewed - since shooting unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in August . Separately, Lemon wrote on Twitter that his meeting with Wilson was 'not out of the ordinary,' and that 'We've interviewed the Brown family, Dorian Johnson and all witnesses. Of course we'd want to interview Wilson.' After a fourth straight night of low-level protests in Ferguson, Missouri, anxious residents still did not know on Sunday when a grand jury would return its decision. The 12-member grand jury adjourned and was to resume meeting behind closed doors on Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing an unidentified St. Louis County official. Preaching at the Greater St Mark Family Church, the Rev. Tommie Pierson urged the congregation to pull together as a community. 'The power to get what you need is already in our hands,' he said. 'You live in a democracy; you must participate.' Looking heavenward, Pierson said: 'You alone know what the grand jury will do. You alone know what the marchers and demonstrators will do. We ask, oh God, for your protection.' After a fourth straight night of low-level protests in Ferguson, Missouri, anxious residents still did not know on Sunday when a grand jury would return its decision . Reports had suggested the 12-member grand jury panel would have a decision by this weekend. There have been nightly rallies and a high-profile law enforcement presence. A lawyer for Michael Brown's family criticized how prosecutors have handled the grand jury process, which has dragged on longer than many expected. The attorney, Benjamin Crump, told ABC's This Week program on Sunday it was the first time in his 20 years as an attorney that a prosecutor had not recommended charges to a grand jury hearing a case. 'Why you can't come in and recommend charges right now based on the probable cause?' Crump said, a reference to witnesses who said Brown had his hands up in the air, signaling surrender, when the officer shot him. Wilson's supporters say he shot Brown in self-defense. St. Louis County prosecutors have said the grand jury's decision will be announced at a news conference, but the date, time and location remain unknown. Crump said he expected to get about six hours notice before an announcement. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has declared a state of emergency and called in National Guard troops to back up police, which protesters have criticized as heavy-handed . In anticipation of the announcement, barriers were erected over the weekend around the courthouse where the jury meets, and traffic restrictions were imposed on some nearby roads. The streets were largely empty of people on Sunday during torrential rain. Two people were arrested outside Ferguson police headquarters late Saturday - an activist from Chicago who has been detained during protests three times since Wednesday and a man identified as a Washington, D.C. based-reporter. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has declared a state of emergency and called in National Guard troops to back up police, which protesters have criticized as heavy-handed.

"The Texas teen who fell asleep at the wheel and caused a crash which killed his parents and three of his five siblings, will not be charged in the fatal accident. Oauchita and Morehouse, Louisana District Attorney Jerry Jones dismissed the careless driving charge against the 16-year-old, saying he had been punished enough by the loss of his family. The teen from Terrell, Texas was taking a turn driving to Walt Disney World when he fell asleep at the wheel Wednesday night and crashed the family's SUV near Calhoun, Louisiana. Parents Trudi and Michael Hardman died at the scene, as well as sons Adam, 7, and Dakota, 15, and 4-year-old daughter Kaci.

They said six of the eight people in the SUV were thrown from the vehicle. None of those killed wore seat belts but the driver did, officials said. Ouachita Parish coroners pronounced the five family members dead on the scene. 'Our heartfelt condolences go out to all of the people affected by this tragic crash,' said Col.

"Strawberries contain high levels of iodine . Children deprived of iodine in the womb are worse at literacy especially in spelling, a new study warned. But lack of the chemical had no effect on a child's maths skills, suggesting the deficiency affects the development of auditory pathways and auditory working memory. Scientists say expectant mums could prevent long-term neurological impairment by taking supplements as part of their daily diet. Iodine is absorbed from food and plays a key role in brain development, but even a mild deficiency during pregnancy can harm the baby's brain development. The nutrient can be found in a variety of foods and is especially rich in shellfish, but pregnant women should not eat this food. The study examined standardised test scores of 228 children whose mothers attended The Royal Hobart Hospital's antenatal clinics in Tasmania between 1999 and 2001. The children were born during a period of mild iodine deficiency in the population, but conditions were reversed when bread manufacturers began using iodised salt in October 2001 as part of a voluntary iodine fortification programme. Results showed inadequate iodine exposure was associated with lasting effects with nine-year-olds - the children who received insufficient iodine in the womb - gaining lower scores on their literacy tests particularly in spelling. However researchers from the University of Tasmania found that low iodine intake had absolutely no effect on maths scores. They suggest iodine deficiency may take more of a toll on the development of auditory pathways and consequently, auditory working memory. Children who were fed adequate levels of iodine in the womb performed better in reading tests. A deficiency did not affect maths results however. They say the results are preventable if pregnant women take daily dietary supplements containing iodine. Dr Kristen Hynes said: 'Our research found children may continue to experience the effects of insufficient iodine for years after birth. Canned Salmon . Cheddar cheese . Ice cream . Eggs . Beef . Pork . Lamb . Apples . Oranges . Grapes . Strawberries . 'Although the participants' diet was fortified with iodine during childhood, later supplementation was not enough to reverse the impact of the deficiency during the mother's pregnancy. 'Fortunately, iodine deficiency during pregnancy and the resulting neurological impact is preventable. 'Pregnant women should follow public health guidelines and take daily dietary supplements containing iodine. 'Public health supplementation programs also can play a key role in monitoring how much iodine the population is receiving and acting to ensure at-risk groups receive enough iodine in the diet.' The results are published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.","Experts have discovered that iodine intake during pregnancy affects a child's ability to read in later life .

"The US State Department has agreed a $500 million arms deal with Poland including the sale of advanced cruise missiles and upgrades to their F-16 fighter fleet. The Polish government wants to buy 40 AGM-158A Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM) from Lockheed Martin. The new cruise missiles have a range of 250 miles and will enable the Polish Air Force to engage targets in Russia without having to leave their own airspace. Scroll down for video . US President Barack Obama visited Poland in June where he saw some of the Polish F-16 fleet . Poland has spent $5 billion upgrading its Air Force with new F-16 attack jets in a major defence investment . The new $500 million deal includes the purchase of 40 AGM-158A cruise missiles with a 250 mile range . According to the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency: 'The proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by helping to improve the security of a NATO ally. 'Poland continues to be an important force for political stability and economic progress in Central Europe. The proposed sale will improve Poland's capability to meet current and future threats of enemy air and ground weapon systems. 'Poland will use the enhanced capability as a deterrent to regional threats and to strengthen its homeland's air-to-ground strike capabilities and increase its contribution to future NATO operations. The proposed sale of the weapons, equipment, and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region.' The proposed sale will require congressional approval although it is expected the transaction will be completed within the next two months. The plan comes as Poland intensifies efforts to modernize its military given the Russian aggression in Ukraine, something that has added to feelings of insecurity in Eastern Europe. Polish Defence Minister Tomasz Siemoniak said Tuesday that missiles for the F-16s are 'one of the most modern weapons in the world at the moment. We really want to have them.' It is understood that the missiles could be deployed and operational within two years. Poland has spent $5 billion on its F-16 fighter jets and is expected to announce an order for either the Eurofighter Typhoon or F-35 next generation jets. The US and Polish Air Force have conducted several training operations over the summer after 18 US F-16 Fighting Falcons were deployed to Lask Airforce base in Poland. According to US Air Force Major Matthew Spears: ' The NATO alliance draws its strength from the ability of its partner nations to seamlessly integrate forces during contingencies. That interoperability stems from a dedication to training during peacetime, and the Av-Det offers the U.S. and Polish air forces the unique opportunity to train together on a regular basis.' NATO aircraft also took part in Poland's national air exercise Eagle Talon. Meanwhile Mr Siemoniak said his country was considering selling weapons to Ukraine. He said: 'I confirm that the Polish defence industry is interested in this direction,"" Siemoniak told private radio station Zet. 'There are several products that may be interesting for Ukraine. 'If only there is a will and a readiness to purchase any elements of armaments in Poland, then Polish factories dream of nothing else but exports,' he also said. NATO officials have said the alliance will not send weapons to Ukraine, which is not a member state, but they have also said individual allies may choose to do so. Russia is fiercely opposed to closer ties between Ukraine and the NATO alliance.","Poland will purchase 40 AGM-158A missles at a cost of $500 million .

"She was born into the richest monarchy in the world, but Russia's last Romanov Grand Duchess ended her days in this unenviable semi in Toronto. War and revolution drove Olga Alexandrovna, sister to Russia's Tsar Nicholas II, to flee her homeland and make way for the nascent Soviet Union while most of her family was executed. The home, which is now for sale $539,000, was the final resting place where she died in 1960 at the age of 78. Scroll down for video . Final home: This semi-detached property in Toronto, Canada, was the home where Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia died in 1960 . Wealth and power: Grand Duchess Olga, left, was the youngest sister of Tsar Nicholas, right, who was the richest royal in the world . Grand Duchess Olga was born into a world of unimaginable luxury and was given a 200-room mansion and a domestic staff of 70 by elder brother, then the world's richest royal. She would have moved in the most rarefied circles of Russian - and world - society, and frequently accompanied the Tsar's family to events of state, such as those held in St Petersburg's world-famous Winter Palace. But her life of imperial splendor came to an abrupt and bloody end after her brother's forced abdication in 1917 to make way for Vladimir Lenin's Bolshevik party, which would transform the Tsar's empire into the Soviet Union. According to Nick Barisheff, whose family used to own the apartment where the Grand Duchess died, in her last year she stayed in bed and ate only ice cream,Canada's National Post reported. Splendor: The Winter Palace in St Petersburg, pictured, was one of many Russian imperial residences where the Grand Duchess would have spent her youth . Grand: Grand Duchess Olga, who reportedly had 'no financial sense' started life with a 200-room mansion and 70 domestic staff at her disposal . She was driven to Canada via the Crimea, and then Denmark, where she and remaining Russian royals were hounded and killed by revolutionaries. Eventually she took a ship to North America to get even further away from those who wanted her dead, and lived a humble existence alongside her second husband and their two children. There she lived a life which hardly bears comparison to the grandeur of the imperial court, but occasionally received visitors from her past. In 1959, the Post reported, her cousin Queen Elizabeth II of England, invited her aboard the royal yacht, Britannia, when she visited nearby Toronto. Royal blood: Grand Duchess Olga was close with the family of her brother the Tsar (center), who was executed in 1918 along with the rest of his family, including Tsarevich Alexei (bottom left) and Grand Duchess Anastasia (right) Despite rumors of a vast, hidden fortune, Grand Duchess Olga reportedly only took a few trinkets with her across the Atlantic - though she was not even careful of those. Barisheff said: 'The Grand Duchess had no financial sense whatsoever. When people visited her house in Cooksville and admired her stuff she would ask, ""Do you like it? That’s your gift for today.""’ 'These could be things passed down from Catherine the Great.' The property, which is now dilapidated and in need of repair, has served as a beauty salon, a travel agency and a religious building, as well as a royal residence.","Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna was born into unimaginable wealth .

"About half of all mosques and Muslim centres in Britain have been subjected to Islamophobic attacks since 9/11, it has been revealed. The figures, from the Islamophobia watchdog Tell Mama, found that between 40 and 60 per cent of mosques . and other Islamic centres - about 700 - have been targeted in Britain since the 2001 attack on New York's World Trade Center. It comes as English Defence League supporters prepare to gather in Woolwich at the scene of Drummer Lee Rigby's murder later this afternoon. Drummer Rigby was hacked to death in front of horrified on-lookers in south-east London last month. The number of anti-Islamic attacks has gone up significantly since the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby in south east London in May . Drummer Lee Rigby, who was killed on the streets of south east London in May . Report author Professor Nigel Copsey, of . Teesside University, said: 'What is . significant about our analysis is the extent to which the far right is . implicated in anti-Muslim hate crime.' Research by the Independent newspaper also found almost a tenfold increase in attacks in the days after Drummer Rigby's death, with mosques being set . alight and Muslims targeted at home. There were nearly nine attacks per day in the immediate aftermath of the killing, . settling back to around two per day over in the following weeks. Professor Copsey said: 'There has undoubtedly been a spike in anti-Muslim incidents since the Woolwich murder.

"Pittsburgh Steelers cornerback William Gay remembers arriving at the hospital as a confused seveb-year-old trying to understand why members of his family were sobbing uncontrollably. He soon learned that his mother had been shot in the back three times. The assailant, Gay's stepfather, shot himself in the head, the .38 caliber revolver landing between the bodies. In her memory: Pittsburgh Steelers cornerback William Gay's mother was killed at the hands of his father. Now he is taking a stand against domestic violence . Tragedy: Gay's mother, Carolyn Hall, was alive for five hours at the hospital before succumbing, while her husband died instantly . Turning point: The 1992 tragedy turned Gay into an advocate for women threatened by domestic violence, a scourge that landed on the doorstep of the National Football League this year and undermined its leadership . Gay's mother, Carolyn Hall, was alive for five hours at the hospital before succumbing, while her husband died instantly. If life in a Tallahassee, Florida, housing project was tough already, things just got a lot more demanding for William Gay. But the 1992 tragedy ultimately turned Gay into an advocate for women threatened by domestic violence, a scourge that landed on the doorstep of the National Football League this year and undermined its leadership. Several of the league's top players, including Adrian Peterson and Ray Rice, have seen their domestic violence cases play out publicly and sponsors have been vocal critics of the league's initial light sanctions for the stars. Leader? As the NFL tries to re-establish its credibility on the issue, 29-year-old Gay finds himself in a unique position of helping fellow players avoid violence against wives, partners and children. Purple is the color: While many NFL players wear pink cleats for breast cancer awareness, Gay faced a possible NFL fine for donning purple shoes in October in honor of Domestic Violence Awareness Month . As the NFL tries to re-establish its credibility on the issue, including beleaguered Commissioner Roger Goodell, the 29-year-old Gay finds himself in a unique position of helping fellow players avoid violence against wives, partners and children. Gay never knew there were problems in his home. There was no fighting and no visible bruises on his mother. 'I dealt with a lot of anger because I felt like, 'Why me?'' he said softly. 'I threw out that question a lot. I got to a point where I didn't care. I felt like no one cared about me. Didn't care about school. I started lashing out at people.' Gay was headed down the wrong path until at the age of 12, he received some tough love from his uncle, Army veteran Ronald Hall. 'He basically talked to me like a grown man,' said Gay. All for good cause: 'Even though she wasn't here, my mom molded me into the man I am today,' said Gay. 'I still pray to her all the time.' Well rounded individuiial: Beneath the uniform is another reminder of what happened on March 14, 1992, a tattoo seared on to his arm . 'I sat him down and said, 'William you cannot blame the world for what is happening. In order for you to be a better person, you better let it go. You're going to end up in jail or dead,'' said Hall. 'He took it to heart.' Gay received a scholarship to the University of Louisville before entering the pros as a fifth-round draft choice for the Steelers in 2007. Soon enough, he had a Super Bowl ring when the Steelers won the championship in 2008. For years, he has quietly worked at the Women's Center and Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh where his key role is speaking to the mothers about domestic abuse. 'To hear it from someone who was a child whose mother was murdered really resonates,' said shelter chief executive Shirl Regan. 'Those talks are done off-camera. Nobody sees that. That's on his time. He does that because it comes from his heart.' While many NFL players wear pink cleats for breast cancer awareness, Gay faced a possible NFL fine for donning purple shoes in October in honor of Domestic Violence Awareness Month.

"Pressure: Thrown off guard by a heckler in Edinburgh who accused him of slashing benefits, Mr Duncan Smith said last week the 'reality is this country is not cutting welfare' David Cameron's austerity programme’ was under pressure last night as a fierce war of words broke out over major welfare curbs and tax cuts for the well-off that take effect over the next week. The Labour and Tory feuding came after Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith blurted out that he had given up trying to cut the benefits bill. He said he is simply ‘managing’ the ever-rising increase in handouts – and was forced to deny his new ‘universal’ benefit is in turmoil. His comments were in stark contrast to remarks by his own Minister for the Disabled, Esther McVey, who told The Mail on Sunday she is determined to stop widespread abuse of the £13 billion-a-year disability benefit claimed by three million. And Ed Miliband came under fire over a highly-provocative leaflet attacking the cut in the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p from April 6. The Labour leaflet, designed to look like a lottery flyer, states: ‘£100,000 win for everyone earning £1 million.’ In fact, people who earn £1 million, will be £42,500 better off per year. A Tory official said: ‘Labour’s claim is a lie and the crude politics of envy. Cutting the top rate means more people work hard and pay more in tax overall, so the Government has more money, not less, to spend on services.’ The clashes mark long-awaited changes in taxes and benefits that start tomorrow. They include the so-called ‘bedroom . tax’, a cut in benefits to people in under-occupied homes; the so-called . ‘granny tax’, abolishing special tax breaks for over 65s; new checks to . stop 500,000 people claiming up to £120 a week in Disability Living . Allowance and a one per cent cap on benefit rises. Thrown off his guard by a heckler in . Edinburgh who accused him of slashing benefits, Mr Duncan Smith said . last week the ‘reality is this country is not cutting welfare . . . all . those on cash benefits will still see cash increases in every year of . this Parliament’. Criticism: Ed Miliband came under fire over a highly-provocative leaflet attacking the cut in the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p from April 6 . Mr Duncan’s Smith’s indiscreet . comments exposed his private fury that his ‘war on welfare’ has been . vetoed by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. But it makes a mockery of repeated claims by Mr Cameron and Mr Duncan Smith himself that they want to cut welfare. Privately, Mr Duncan Smith is still . seething that three big welfare cuts put forward by him – freezing . welfare benefits, scrapping housing benefit for under 25s and axeing . additional handouts for people on benefits with two children who have a . third – were all ruled out by the Lib Dems. They would have saved £10 billion a year. A Tory source said: ‘Mr Duncan Smith . would dearly like to go much go further in reducing welfare, but he . can’t because of the Lib Dems. 'All he has done is admit the truth: because of the Lib Dems, the welfare bill will carry on rising under the Coalition. 'He is frustrated by it as all the evidence is the public supports him.’ The source denied Mr Duncan Smith was . trying to play down the looming welfare benefits crackdown because . claimants are about to realise their handouts have been cut – or . stopped. There was no reference in Mr Clegg’s . Easter message to benefit cuts. Minister for the Disabled Ms McVey told . The Mail on Sunday of her determination to force through controversial . reforms to the Disability Living Allowance. From April 8, the benefit is to be . renamed Personal Independence Payments, and claimants will be subjected . to regular face-to-face checks. The word ‘disability’ has been . dropped from the name of the handout as Ministers say it is falsely . claimed by large numbers of people who are temporarily incapacitated and . still claim it when well. To back up the case for reform, . Ministers highlighted new official figures showing that, since 2008, . nearly 900,000 people dropped their incapacity benefit claims rather . than undergo a tough medical test. The figure amounted to more than a third of the total number of people claiming sickness-related benefits. Ms McVey is determined to weed out . another 500,000 people suspected of making – and winning – claims for . DLA, many of which are paid for life on the basis of form filling.","Work and Pensions Secretary said he had given up trying to cut benefits bill .

"Archaeologists have uncovered what could be the grave of Alexander the Great at a site near ancient Amphipolis. The warrior king - who ruled in the 4th century BC - was thought to be buried in Egypt. But experts have now become excited after they uncovered a marble-faced wall dating from the time.

Alexander III of Macedon, also known as Alexander the Great, was a king of Macedon, a state in northern ancient Greece . Site archaeologist Aikaterini Peristeri has voiced hopes of finding 'a significant individual or individuals' within. A Culture Ministry statement has enthused that the archaeologists have partly excavated a mound that has yielded a 'very remarkable' marble-faced wall from the late 4th century BC. Experts believe the ancient artificial mound could contain the remains of the king, or is at least an important royal Macedonian grave. The news has captured the Greek . public's imaginations and many people are hopeful the site will solve . the mystery of where Alexander the Great rests. However, Greece's Culture Ministry has warned against 'overbold' speculation that archaeologists are close to uncovering the king's remains.

However, by the age of 30 he had created one of the largest empires of the ancient world, stretching from the Ionian Sea to the Himalayas. Undefeated in all his battles, he is considered one of history's most successful commanders. He succeeded his father to the throne in 336BC and inherited a strong kingdom and experienced army. Having . been awarded the generalship of Greece, he commenced his father's . military expansion plans and in 334 BC began a series of campaigns that . lasted 10 years. He conquered the whole of the Persian Empire but being an ambitious warrior, seeking to reach the 'ends of the world,' he invaded India in 326 BC but later turned back. It is believed Alexander the Great died in Babylon in 323 BC before his plans to invade Arabia. He is credited with founding some 20 cities that bore his name, including Alexandria in ancient Egypt, and spread Greece's culture east. There are several stories about where Alexander the Great was buried after he suddenly died of a fever at the age of just 32 - although some believe he was poisoned. History tells that his body was laid to rest in a gold sarcophagus filled with honey. It is said to have been taken to Memphis before Alexandria in Egypt where it remained until late Antiquity. Famous Romans Pompey, Augustus and Julius Caesar are all said to have visited his tomb in Alexandria, with Caligula reportedly swiping the warrior's breastplate for a souvenir.","Archaeologists have uncovered what could be the grave of Alexander the Great at a site near ancient Amphipolis, 370 miles north of Athens .

"Power couple: Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt in Sydney last week. The Oscar-winning actress was reportedly spotted house hunting in Marylebone . They already own a sprawling Los Angeles home and a 35-bedroom French chateau - and now Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are thought to be looking for a base in London. The Oscar-winning actress was spotted house hunting in Marylebone, according to reports, sparking rumours that the Hollywood power couple could be looking for a new home. If they do buy in the upmarket area, they will be moments away from celebrity hotspot the Chiltern Firehouse - where Jennifer Aniston, Princess Beatrice and Kylie Minogue have dined this month. Jolie has looked at homes priced at up to £20million, a local source told The Sunday Times. Earlier this week it was revealed that a number of lavish apartments have gone on sale in the area, part of a new property development called The Chilterns. One four-bedroom penthouse - which boasts David Bailey artwork and an in-house chef - is on the market at £25million. Perks include an on-site gym and a 24-hour hotel-style concierge which will take care of everything from travel arrangements and theatre tickets to dry cleaning and shopping. And a neighbouring plot, designed by top architects Squire & Partners, is on the market for £12.6million. It is not yet clear whether Jolie and Pitt are planning to move with their six children to London permanently. Their main home is Chateau Miraval, their sprawling estate nestled in an ancient village in the south of France. The property is surrounded by a moat, and boasts a spa, two gyms, and an indoor swimming pool. The couple chose the stunning chateau as the venue for their private wedding ceremony - attended by just 22 guests - this summer. If they do splash out on a London home, they will be the latest in a string of A-listers to snap up property in the UK.

"A woman who invented a wild tale of survival during the holocaust has been ordered to forfeit the $22.5 million judgement she won from her publishers by a Massachusetts court. Published in 1997, Misha: A Mémoire of the Holocaust Years is about a Jewish girl from Brussels who walked across Europe by herself after her parents were seized by Nazis. Misha Defonseca, 76, and her ghostwriter Vera Lee won $32.4 million from publisher Jane Daniel and Mt Ivy Press in a copyright registration claim in 1998 in which Daniel was found to have conducted 'highly improper representations and activities.' Storyteller: Misha Defonseca admitted to making up most of her memoir about her childhood as a Jewish orphan in WWII . Daniel appealed, but in 2005 the Massachusetts Appeals Court upheld the judgement. However, during the appeal process, inconsistencies in Defonseca's outlandish tale began to attract the suspicion of Daniel, journalists, forensic genealogists, reports the Courthouse News Service. In her memoir, Defonseca wrote that she trekked 1,900 miles across Europe in search of her parents. She spent months living in the forest with a pack of wolves, hiding from Nazis and in one encounter, stabbed a Nazi rapist to death. These events all occurred when she was aged between seven and 11 years old, according to the book. Following her trial loss, Daniel set out to determine whether Defonseca's tale was truthful. She eventually located a document that included Defonseca's maiden name - which in the book was Levy - and her date and place of birth. One of the pack: In her memoir, Defonseca wrote that she lived for a time with a pack of wolves while hiding from Nazis . Her real name, Daniel found, was Monica Ernestine Josephine De Wael, and she was not Jewish. During the time she was supposed to have been communing with wolves and killing Nazis, Defonseca was in actual fact enrolled in a Brussels school. Defonseca, now living in Massachusetts, has admitted that her best-selling book was an elaborate fantasy she kept repeating, even as the book was translated into 18 languages and made into a feature film in France. 'This story is mine. It is not actually reality, but my reality, my way of surviving,' Defonseca said in a statement given by her lawyers to The Associated Press. 'I ask forgiveness to all who felt betrayed. I beg you to put yourself in my place, of a four-year-old girl who was very lost,' the statement said. She admitted that her parents were arrested when she was four and she was taken care of by her grandfather and uncle. Bestseller: The book was not a huge hit in the U.S. but sold millions in Canada and Europe . Defonseca said she was poorly treated by her adopted family, called a 'daughter of a traitor' because of her parents' role in the resistance, which she said led her to 'feel Jewish.' She said there were moments when she 'found it difficult to differentiate between what was real and what was part of my imagination.' Defonseca had been asked to write the book by publisher Jane Daniel in the 1990s, after Daniel heard the writer tell the story in a Massachusetts synagogue. Daniel and Defonseca fell out over profits received from the best-selling book, which led to a lawsuit. In 2005, a Boston court ordered Daniel to pay Defonseca and her ghost writer Vera Lee $32.4 million, of which Defonseca received $22.5 million. In 2012, the Superior Court found that Defonseca had committed a fraud and set aside the verdict. She appealed and on April 29, Judge Marc Kantrowitz, in what he described as 'the third, and hopefully the last' opinion on the matter, agreed that the truth of Defonseca's story would have made a difference to the jury's deliberations. Judge Kantrowitz noted that Defonseca and Daniel had both acted 'highly inappropriately,' and expressed the Court's hope that 'the saga has now come to an end,' reports Mondaq.","Misha Defonseca won $22.5 in a copyright case against her publisher .

"Greg Mortenson doesn't want to talk about his best-selling 'Three Cups of Tea' book, but everybody else does — including his own charity. Three years ago, '60 Minutes' and author Jon Krakauer alleged that Mortenson fabricated much of the book and mismanaged the charity he co-founded, Central Asia Institute. The allegations pushed Mortenson to lock himself in his bedroom. He fought off depression and eventually underwent heart surgery. The Central Asia Institute lost most of its donors, with contributions plummeting from a high of about $22million in 2010 to $2.7million last year. Scroll down for video . Three Cups of Tea author Greg Mortenson will start promoting his charity, the Central Asia Institute, three years after 60 Minutes exposed parts of the book as fabrication and the foundation mismanaged. Pictured above on Tuesday in Bozeman, Montana . 60 Minutes revealed that Mortenson made up large parts of his best-seller Three Cups of Tea, and its sequel Stones Into Schools . The organization's new leaders have slashed the budget and cut school construction programs, but they still had to borrow from savings to meet expenses. Board chairman Steve Barrett is worried about the organization's long-term financial health. So Barrett and the other board members are calling on Mortenson to help reverse the skid by appearing in promotional videos and resuming the speaking engagements he put on hold in 2011. Mortenson, who said he's feels healthier than he has in 18 years, has reluctantly agreed. 'There's a lot of pressure on me to go out and start talking to the public and the media, which I was reluctant to do. Not only because things kind of quieted down and I'm kind of liking my life, but I also don't want to have to open up all these cans of worms again,' he said at his Bozeman home on Tuesday. 'I feel like a criminal coming back,' he added. He knows the questions that will dog him. Did he make up the story about how he decided to devote his life to building schools? Was he really kidnapped by the Taliban when visiting a remote part of northwestern Pakistan? Did he lie to sell books? Mortenson doesn't relish the prospect of having to answer those questions, but that's exactly what Central Asia Institute wants. The organization wants Mortenson to tell his side of the story in hopes that it can move past the '60 Minutes' piece and get back to educating children. Krakauer said Wednesday that Mortenson must come clean before the public will forgive him. He believes that Central Asia Institute will not prosper as long as Mortenson is its public face. 'Greg needs to go, right now,' Krakauer said. 'Until Greg is gone, there is no hope for having an honest organization.' Barrett, for his part, said Mortenson must be involved in any effort to bring the institute back to financial stability. 'Greg needs to go, right now': Colorado-based author Jon Krakauer revealed Mortenson's lies as well, and says he needs to step down from the foundation. Pictured above on Wednesday in Denver . Scrutiny: The book follows the adventures of co-author Greg Mortenson, pictured in Wakhan, northeastern Afghanistan in 2009, as he set up schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan . 'Greg is recognizable, he commands an audience and people want to hear what happened,' Barrett said. 'People are going to be wondering, so he has to be a part of it.' It's a risky gambit, and Mortenson is not sure if the public will give him a second chance. But he said the Central Asia Institute is doing good work by supporting the education of children, especially girls, in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Tajikistan, and it's up to him to raise funds to make sure it can continue. 'You wish the past could just be done with, but there are still a lot of questions. So I'd like to answer those questions (and) let the public decide, but then let me move on and help those girls and kids overseas,' Mortenson said. Mortenson apologized for letting people down. He insists the stories in 'Three Cups of Tea' are true, though he has changed the telling of some of them since they were published. He also disputes the Montana attorney general's findings that he enriched himself by taking charter flights on Central Asia Institute's dime, and by keeping all the speakers' fees and the royalties from books the organization bought and gave away. Greg Mortenson's best-selling book 'Three Cups of Tea' came under intense scrutiny after 60 Minutes, author Jon Krakauer and some people in the book said some of the stories were fabricated. Here is a glance at some of those stories, what is being disputed and Mortenson's response in a recent interview with The Associated Press. MORTENSON'S DESCENT FROM K2: . Three Cups of Tea: Mortenson stumbled upon the Pakistani village of Korphe in fall 1993 after trekking from the base camp of K2, the world's second-highest peak. He spent days in the village recovering from the descent. The dispute: Mortenson could not have wandered to Korphe on that trip because it is on the opposite side of the Braldu River, which could not be crossed without reaching Mortenson's original destination on the opposite shore, the village of Askole. Author Jon Krakauer says no bridge crossing existed. Krakauer says he interviewed a climber and others who confirmed a bridge was at that location before and after that period, but not at the time Mortenson was there. Mortenson's response: Mortenson insists he went to Korphe over a narrow footbridge, and disputes Krakauer's assertions to the contrary. Mortenson has acknowledged that he spent only a few hours there, not days as was depicted in the book. MORTENSON'S PROMISE TO BUILD A SCHOOL: . Three Cups of Tea: Mortenson promised the villagers of Korphe that he would build them a school, after they nursed him back to health. That promise forever changed his life, and he dedicated himself to building schools in Central Asia. The dispute: Since Mortenson never went to Korphe, he couldn't have promised to build them a school. However, he did promise the villagers of Khane to the southeast that he would build them a school, but he reneged on that promise and instead built it in Korphe. A fundraising plea written by Mortenson in 1994 backs up the claim that he wanted to build the school in Khane, and it makes no mention of Korphe. Mortenson's response: Mortenson now says he visited both Korphe and Khane villages during that 1993 trip, and promised the residents of both that he would build schools for them. He says he planned to first build the Khane school but then switched to Korphe after finding a lack of local support and corruption in the first. MORTENSON'S KIDNAPPING: . Three Cups of Tea: Mortenson was kidnapped and held hostage by militants in the remote Pakistani region of Waziristan. They took his passport and money, kept him under armed guard and monitored his every movement. He won his freedom after asking for a Koran and telling his captors that his wife was expecting a child. The dispute: People who were there described Mortenson as a guest in Waziristan, not a hostage. A photo shows him with his supposed captors, with Mortenson brandishing an AK-47. Mortenson's response: Mortenson stands by his story, though he says he regrets the unflattering descriptions of his captors in 'Three Cups of Tea.' An attorney general's investigation resulted in Mortenson reimbursing the organization more than $1.1million, removing him from any financial decisions and making wholesale changes to the organization's leadership. Mortenson said he plans to eventually leave the organization. First, he wants to help raise contributions so they match expenses. Then, he wants to see the graduation of the first wave of girls who entered Central Asia Institute's schools built in Afghanistan about a decade ago. He still is the highest-paid employee of Central Asia Institute, drawing $169,000 in salaries and benefits last year. Charity: Greg Mortenson with local businesswomen in Gojal Hunza, in Pakistan - where his charity worked to improve the quality of life for people there. However, the 60 Minutes report found that what school she Mortenson's foundation did build, many were repurposed or left without support . If he left Central Asia Institute, Mortenson said he would go on a long trip overseas before pursuing new projects advocating for girls' education. He said he has been quietly helping groups working in Uganda and South Sudan. He also has not shelved his writing career. He said he has written enough during the past two years to have material for three books, all about empowering girls and women. But he said he is under pressure to write a book in response to 60 Minutes and Krakauer. He said he won't do it. 'Some people like to make themselves look good by making others look bad. It's not in my nature to make others look bad,' he said.","Greg Mortenson co-wrote the best-seller 'Three Cups of Tea'
Three years ago, it was revealed that Mortenson made up several key points of the book and its sequel - including his 'capture' in 1996 by the Taliban which didn't exist in the country at that time .
Mortenson was also accused of receiving an excess of funds raised for his charity, the Central Asia Institute .
Contributions to the charity have since plummeted from a high of $22million in 2010 to just $2.7million last year .
Now, Mortenson will return to promoting the charity in homes of raising donations for the flailing foundation ."
"The CDC and Frontier Airlines have widened their search for people possibly exposed to Ebola by sickened nurse Amber Vinson - including more than 800 passengers who unwittingly flew on a Frontier plane after Vinson. 16 people in Akron and Cleveland, Ohio, who had contact with Ms Vinson last weekend are being monitored by health officials there, local health officials revealed today - up from seven on Thursday. One, Ms Vinson's step-father, is in strict quarantine. The CDC announced on Thursday that Ms Vinson may have been contagious as early as last Friday, though she was not admitted to the hospital until Tuesday. Passengers aboard two flights that Ms Vinson took have been told to monitor themselves for signs of the deadly virus for 21 days over fears that Ms Vinson was contagious both when she flew from Dallas to Cleveland on October 10 and when she returned to Texas on Monday. Scroll down for video . Amber Vinson, 29, is feared to have been exhibiting Ebola symptoms as early as Friday before she took her flight out of Dallas-Fort Worth Airport to Cleveland, Ohio . The Frontier Airlines plane that Amber Vinson flew from Cleveland to Dallas on Monday, flies out of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport on Wednesday. It emerged today that Miss Vinson may have been showing symptoms on her inbound flight to Cleveland . Police have taped off a home in Tallmadge, Ohio which belongs to the mother of Ebola patient Amber Vinson . The plane that Ms Vinson was in made five flights loaded with passengers before the CDC notified Frontier that she may have been contagious. The airline is now trying to contact its passengers who flew on plane number N220FR, an Airbus A320, before it was removed from service. The plane made flights to Atlanta and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and back to Cleveland. WKYC-TV reports that more than 800 passengers are affected by the notice. Passengers who were on the October 10 Frontier Flight 1142 from Dallas/Fort Worth to Cleveland and passengers on Monday's Flight 1143 from Cleveland to Dallas/Fort Worth have been asked to call the CDC and monitor themselves for symptoms. The passengers on the other flight are not thought to be at risk for the disease, but Frontier is notifying them anyway. Those flights are: . Coming Attractions bridal store in Cleveland Ohio. The store has voluntarily shut after Miss Vinson went to the store with five of her friends . A view of some of the offerings inside Coming Attractions, where Miss Vinson went bridesmaid shopping this weekend . Despite the widening crisis, health officials have stressed that the risk to everyone - the passengers aboard Ms Vinson's plane, the people she came in contact with in Ohio and especially those who flew on her plane on later flights - is minimal. Officials also stressed that none of the people being monitored have contracted the virus. CDC Dr Chris Braden revealed during a press briefing on Thursday: 'We had started to look at the possibility that she had symptoms going back as far as Saturday. 'This has to do with the bridal shop. Some more information that has come through recently says we can't rule out that she might have had the start of her symptoms on Friday.' Seven people in Cleveland and Akron have put themselves in voluntary quarantine after coming into contact with Miss Vinson, including five friends whom she shopped with for bridesmaid dresses at bridal store, Coming Attractions, in Cleveland. The news has prompted high schools and medical centers in Ohio to send home staff and students amid fears that they could have come into contact with the nurse. Miss Vinson remained in her home for the three days she was in Cleveland, except for one trip to a bridal store with  friends - but authorities are pressing her further on her movements. The store's owners have voluntarily closed while CDC officials investigate the level of risk. The owner of the store told Newsnet5 that Miss Vinson didn't seem sick  when she visited to pick out dresses. The 29-year-old is now being treated at Emory in Atlanta, Georgia where she was described as being in a stable condition.

A timeline of Ebola patient's Thomas Duncan and the two nurses, Nina Pham and Amber Vinson who contracted the virus while caring for him . Miss Vinson was taken by chartered plane from Dallas to Atlanta Wednesday night, where she is currently being treated at Emory University Hospital . She was airlifted from Dallas, Texas on Wednesday evening on a specialized plane with quarantine unit, along with medical staff in hazmat suits. Miss Vinson was one of the nurses at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital to treat Duncan when he was admitted a second time on September 28, in the first 'high-risk' days when there is a high volume of bodily fluids from projectile vomiting, bleeding and explosive diarrhea. According to CDC guidelines, the nurse should have limited her movements. It is not clear if Miss Vinson called the CDC before boarding her flight from Dallas to Cleveland. One and two: Miss Vinson contracted the disease after treating America's Ebola 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan (left). The 29-year-old bride-to-be was the second nurse who treated Duncan to come down with the virus. The first nurse diagnosed was 26-year-old Nina Pham (right) who was in 'good condition' at Texas Presbyterian Hospital on Thursday . Damage control: Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital is currently monitoring more than 75 health care workers who came into contact with Duncan during his stay. On Wednesday, the hospital announced it would be offering free rooms to these staff members, who may not want to risk infecting their family members . Before her return flight on Monday, the nurse noticed a spike in her temperature and called the CDC several times to see if she should get on the plane. When she finally got through to a CDC representative, she was cleared since her 99.5F fever was beneath the 100.4 threshold. CDC Director Dr Thomas Frieden admits that was the wrong call. Dr Frieden also noted that Miss Vinson had flown to Ohio before the first nurse with Ebola, 26-year-old Nina Pham from Fort Worth, was diagnosed with the virus. Miss Pham was described as being in a 'good condition' today. She is being transferred to a special isolation ward at the National Institutes of Health Hospital in Maryland.","Health officials in Ohio are now monitoring 16 people who had contact with Amber Vinson last weekend - up from seven on Thursday .

'Ten years ago the technology was expensive, but that’s not the case anymore, ‘Ben Wood, head of research at CCS Insight, a mobile phone research company, said.

Carolina Milanesi of consumer research firm Kantar Worldpanel added western nations including the UK are only just waking up to the potential of smartphone technology with has been cheap for several years. She said: 'About seven years ago manufacturers in China started teaming up with chip makers. They took the standard workings of a smartphone and made huge numbers at low cost. 'They then attach a screen, a case and a camera and take it to market at low cost. 'So far they have been focusing on emerging markets, mainly Africa and south Asia, but now they are beginning to look closely at mature markets.' Other cut-price brands hoping to gain a foothold in the British mobile market include French firm Wiko, which launched a £60 smartphone in April this year. The Karbonn A50S mainly uses previous generation hardware, although it is still a highly competent handset. It runs the last but one version of Android, which is also used by handset makers Samsung, HTC and many others. And while the 3.5-inch touchscreen is small for a modern smartphone and does not provide high-definition display, the dual-core processor – the chip that controls the phone – is as fast as many other handsets. Britons wishing to buy a Karbonn A50S must first register with an Indian courier firm that provides a local postal address or ask a friend or relative in India to let them use their address. The smartphone can then be bought online and delivered to the address in India and forwarded to the UK. Sending a 2kg package – the approximate weight of the Karbonn handset - to the UK costs about £20 and because the phone is so cheap there is no import duty to pay.","The Indian-made Karbonn A50S hopes to rival market leaders .

"A Russian rocket blasted off today to deliver three new crew members to the International Space Station - including Italy's first female astronaut. Soyuz TMA-15M, holding incoming station commander Terry Virts, with the US space agency Nasa, left the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazahkstan. Also on board for the lift-off at 3am local time (Sunday 9pm GMT) was Soyuz commander Anton Shkaplerov, with the Russian Federal Space Agency.

Launch: The crew face a busy six months in orbit, including a trio of spacewalks to prepare the station for a new fleet of space taxis . Space adventure: They are due to begin flying crew to the International Space Station in late 2017 . Completing the trio was first-time flier Samantha Cristoforetti, with the European Space Agency. They were expected to reach the station, which flies about 260 miles above Earth, less than six hours after lift-off. The station, owned and operated by 15 nations, serves an orbiting laboratory for life science, materials research and technology development. It also hosts other experiments that take advantage of the unique microgravity environment and vantage point of space. Mr Virts said: ‘I think that 100 (or) 500 years from now, people will look back on this as the initial baby steps that we took going into the solar system.

"Dazzlingly colourful and irresistibly fluffy, faux fur is taking over the High Street. From Bon Marché to Marks and Spencer, retailers are selling a wide range of stoles, hats, coats and bedspreads this winter. And shoppers are snapping them up after seeing celebrities such as Kate Moss and Victoria Beckham swathed in the fabric. But far from concealing the fact the fur isn’t real, they’re flaunting it as a way of proving their ethical credentials. No wonder: fur has been demonised to such an extent by animal-rights campaigners that wearing the real thing is likely to earn you a few severe looks at best, and public rants by strangers at worst. Both Pippa Middleton (pictured) and her sister Kate have been seen in real fur in recent years . However, the fur industry is now fighting back with a devastating — and intriguing — suggestion that faux fur is actually far less ethical than real fur. And the campaign is working: sales of real fur are booming again. To understand the contentious issue, we have to go back to 1994, when five supermodels took off their clothes, sat on the floor and told the world: ‘We’d rather go naked than wear fur.’ The campaign, by animal-rights charity Peta, was a triumph. Sales of mink, sable and chinchilla plummeted. Since then, all but one of the five models (Christy Turlington) has failed to keep their word: Naomi Campbell, for example, posed in a £120,000 Russian sable coat in 2009, and Cindy Crawford promoted mink coats in 2004. Celebrities such as Gwyneth Paltrow, both Middleton sisters, Beyonce, Cara Delevingne and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley have worn fur in recent years. And real-fur sales have increased globally by 58 per cent since the end of the Nineties, says the British Fur Trade Association (BFTA). There have been no fur farms in the UK since 2003 due to the Fur Farming (Prohibition) Act . Indeed, almost 500 designers, including Diane von Furstenberg, Yves Saint Laurent and Roberto Cavalli, currently use fur in their collections. And some furriers claim almost three-quarters of this year’s catwalk shows feature fur. TV stylist Mark Heyes says: ‘Without question, it’s becoming more fashionable. I’ve never seen so much fur on the High Street. Faux or real, it’s on almost every item going, from dresses to tops and even keyrings.’ So, what on Earth has happened to change our minds on fur so radically? The battle between the anti and pro-fur lobbies is still being fought vehemently. But Mike Moser, chief executive of BFTA, thinks that the new generation of fashionistas is waking up to the environmental impact of faux-fur production — and deciding that climate change is their main concern. ‘Younger people in particular want to hear all the facts then make up their own minds,’ he says. ‘The argument that we should replace real fur with fake is completely wrong. For environmental reasons, it should be the other way around. Faux fur is taking over the High Street after shoppers have seen celebrities wearing it . ‘There isn’t any doubt that the environmental impact of fake fur is profoundly worse than fur-farming.’ It’s undeniable that fake fur is made from non-renewable petroleum-based products, such as nylon, acrylic and polyester, then treated with heat and chemicals to improve its look and feel. These industrial processes use three times as much non-renewable energy as real fur, according to the International Fur Trade Federation. Gwyneth Paltrow has also been seen in real fur. Real-fur sales have increased globally by 58 per cent since the end of the Nineties, says the British Fur Trade Association (BFTA) But fashion-conscious consumers often dump their faux-fur garments after just one season. Many end up in landfill and, just like petroleum-based plastic bags, can take up to 1,000 years to decompose. Real fur, meanwhile, biodegrades naturally within six months to a year, and can even be composted in the garden, says Mike Moser. Washing fake fur may harm the environment, too. With every machine wash, says a 2011 paper for the Environmental Science & Technology journal, each garment releases an average of 1,900 tiny particles of plastic, which are then swilled into rivers, lakes and, eventually, the sea. Cindy Crawford promoted mink coats in 2004 despite having featured in PETA's anti-fur campaign . It’s feared these particles may kill marine life and disrupt food chains. Pro-fur lobbies also point to the unethical working practices of some faux-fur manufacturers. It’s already widely known that disposable fashion often relies on Third World sweatshop labour, paltry wages and toxic working conditions. But the International Fur Trade Federation claims that the manufacture of fake fur doubles the risk of ill-health in workers due to the emissions of carcinogenic substances during production. And American Fur Commission spokesman Michael Whelan says: ‘Fast fashion is promoting dependence on foreign oil and exacerbating child-labour issues in the Third World.’ Given all this, should we not be buying the real deal instead? Costume designer Minna Attala, who has worked for Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre and Asos and is a life-long vegetarian, says it’s a grey area. ‘I’m not pro-fur but, because I’ve been educated on the subject, I’m not against it either,’ she says. In 1994, five supermodels took off their clothes, sat on the floor and told the world: ‘We’d rather go naked than wear fur’, including Naomi Campbell who has since worn it in public . ‘Killing animals for vanity is not right, but there are whole communities of people who rely on this industry for employment, and, in the majority of cases, the animals are treated well, so that they’ll have healthy coats. ‘Animals are treated horrifyingly in the meat industry, and nobody is throwing cans of red paint at steak-eaters.’ Around 20 per cent of fur comes not from farms, but trapping wild animals. These creatures, claim the pro-fur campaigners, are often killed quickly and humanely. Some are culled to help balance animal populations and native ecosystems. In New Zealand. for example, the government has encouraged people to buy what they call ‘the world’s most ecological fur’ — that of the paihamu, a small, non-native, furry animal that has been wreaking havoc on native species. Victoria Beckham has also been credited with the rise in popularity of faux fur . Meanwhile, fur-friendly companies, such as the Gucci Group, insist that all their furs are vegetable-dyed and tanned via traditional, non-toxic methods. However, this comes at a price — a mink scarf from Gucci costs £1,500. The BFTA advises consumers to buy only garments marked with the ‘Origin Assurance’ label, a scheme launched in 2007 to ensure that fur ‘comes from a country where welfare regulations or standards governing fur production are in force’. Mike Moser is adamant that almost two-thirds of fur traded internationally is from Origin Assurance countries. Yet none of this will convince Peta’s UK director Mimi Bekhechi that real fur is anything other than abhorrent. She maintains that the pro-lobby have got it wrong on the environmental impact of faux fur, and says there are plenty of eco-friendly faux options available. She also claims that a cocktail of carcinogens, such as ammonia, chromium and formaldehyde, which is often used in dressing and dyeing real fur, negates its biodegradability. ‘Fur is only “natural” when it’s on the animal who was born with it,’ says Mimi. ‘Recent independent studies have found that the impact of production of a mink coat on climate change is three to ten times higher than the impact of a faux-fur coat. ‘We all have the choice to be cruel or kind. So, when real fur involves electrocuting a fox, or slitting the throat of a rabbit for fur trim, choosing one of the many soft, warm and luxurious faux or fur-free options, which are also more eco-friendly, becomes a no-brainer.’ Meanwhile, Minna Attala says: ‘If someone was to be truly to-the- letter ethical, they ought to forego both real and faux fur — and also fast fashion in general.’ No wonder the great fur debate remains as heated as ever. But, as the weather gets chillier and we reach for our Cossack hat and warming stole, it seems there’s no easy answer.","Both Pippa Middleton and sister Kate have been seen in real fur .

"A hunter in New Zealand proves just how remarkably the Himalayan tahr can blend into their environment in a video filmed while out on a shoot. At first, the opening moments of Brett Langford's short piece of footage looks like an unimpressive rocky hillside but it soon becomes an optical illusion of sorts. When a shot is fired into grey rock the objects that looked like brown boulders turn out to be the very much alive tahr, which rise quickly and disappear down the slope. A herd of Himalayan tahr, who blend impressively with their surrounds, flee after the gunshot of a hunter . The tahr, large goat-like animals originally from the mountain ranges of India and Nepal, were introduced to New Zealand by European settlers for sport hunting. They have thrived in the landscape to such an extent that their numbers are now culled, the New Zealand's Department of Conservation say, to 'control numbers in critical sites of high conservation value'. 'Tahr are popular with recreational and tourist hunters,' says . 'Their horns – and sometimes the male’s striking mane – are sought-after trophies. Tahr are generally found in the alpine grassland zone, where they graze on snow tussocks, alpine herbs and sub-alpine shrubland plants.' The calm before the bang on the rugged West Coast as more tahr than we can see with a naked eye sit still . A tahr surveys its surrounds near Queenstown - the species was introduced by European settlers . After the shot is fired the tahr rise in great numbers throughout the frame and flee to the right . The tahr are most prevalent in the alps of the South Island, between the Rakaia and Whitcombe valleys in the north near Christchurch to Lake Hawea in the rugged south near extreme sports mecca Queenstown. Tourists are welcome to join tahr hunts year-round with the appropriate permits, with the feral range for the species accounting for about 1.7 million hectares of the central South Island. The West Coast Tai Poutini has 47 areas where tahr hunting is permitted, while the Canterbury region in the east of the island has 12 areas. The popularity of the Haast area above Mount Aspiring National Park means a ballot is conducted to ensure it isn't crowded with hunters.","Brett Langford filmed a hillside while he was hunting tahr in New Zealand .

"Harry Dexter White was the architect of the post-war financial system, which paved the way for the West to dominate the 20th century and win the Cold War. But it has now emerged that the brilliant economist was in fact a staunch anti-capitalist who privately praised the Soviet Union's communism. Documents unearthed at Princeton University prove that, although White devoted his life to strengthening western capitalism, he secretly despised the system he had created and believed it would eventually be overtaken by the state-controlled economy of the USSR and its allies. The flawed genius did not live long enough to find out just how wrong he was, as he died in 1948, before both the decades-long boom enjoyed by the U.S. and Europe and the slow decline of the East. Harry Dexter White, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, was accused of providing information to the Soviets. He appeared before the House Un-American Activities Committee in August, 1948 . The astonishing revelation of White's . communist sympathies finally explains why he agreed to spy on his own . country for the Soviets even while representing America at the 1944 . Bretton Woods conference which would determine the post-war economic . order. Even though the conference ensured a . postwar global financial climate dominated by the American dollar, White . is thought to have been feeding information to Moscow for years. While White's espionage has been an open secret and acknowledged by Presidents from Truman to Nixon, historian Benn Steil discovered new notes from the economist's Princeton archives dating from 1944 - when he was at the height of his powers in the administration of President Roosevelt. The essay, headed 'Political-Economic Int. of Future', outlines a post-war world where the Soviet socialist model of economic planning takes over from the American liberal capitalist one, according to an article by Mr Steil in Foreign Affairs. John Maynard Keynes, the famous British economist was outwitted by Harry White at the Bretton Woods conference of 1944 . U.S. delegates attending the the Bretton Woods Conference, (l-r, standing): Assistant Secretary of Treasury Harry Dexter White, Fred M. Vinson, Dean Acheson, Edward E. Brown, Marriner S. Eccles, and Michigan Congressman Jesse P. Wolcott. Front row, seated: Senator Robert F. Wagner, Kentucky Congressman Brent Spence, Secretary of Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr., and New Hampshire Senator Charles W. Tobey . The . unpublished notes argue that the West has demonized the Soviet Union, . and dreams of a strong alliance between the United States and their . communist rivals that would create a new world order. In his essay, White predicts that 'the change will be in the direction of increased control . over industry, and increased restrictions on the operations of . competition and free enterprise'. Extraordinarily, he concludes: 'Russia is the first instance of a socialist economy in action. And it works!' Harry Dexter White was one of the greatest economic minds in history, but he might have been bitterly disappointed with his legacy. He was arguably the most influential figure at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire in July 1944, where the Allied nations met to hammer out the shape of global economy after the Second World War. The conference established the principle that open markets were the best way to ensure prosperity, paving the way for the globalisation we have seen over the past decades. Among the specific steps delegates took, led by White, was the establishment of the International Monetary Fund and the forerunner of the World Bank. These twin financial institutions have played an important role in encouraging poorer countries to liberalise their economies by giving them access to credit and insisting they participate in global business networks. While many believe this capitalist system is responsible for the world's unprecedented prosperity, it has now emerged that even though White helped create it he was in fact a communist sympathiser who believed that state-controlled economies would be more successful than capitalist ones. White had clearly deluded himself . about the repressive nature of the Soviet government, claiming that . officials had guaranteed the freedom of religion and denying that the . USSR intended to meddle in the affairs of other countries. White's communism is far from his . image as the capitalist hero who so outmaneuvered the British and their . legendary economist John Maynard Keynes that they ended up agreeing to . the dollar being the currency of the IMF and World Bank instead of the . pound. The Bretton Woods conference comprised 730 delegates from all 44 Allied nations, including the Soviet Union, and even though White emerged as an American hero he had already begun feeding the Russians information for most of that year. Among the consequences of the conference were the creation of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, two institutions which have been integral to the spread of liberal capitalism around the globe. By contrast, soon after the end of the war the Soviet Union started to fall behind the U.S. and fast-growing Europe, and within three decades was significantly poorer than its western rivals. White made such an impact at Bretton Woods that on January 23, 1946, President Harry Truman nominated White to be the first American executive director of the IMF and he was widely tipped to become the fund's managing director. However, by this time FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover had begun to investigate White, and the paranoid law enforcement chief placed him under investigation for two months after colleagues became concerned about his political beliefs. The investigation proved fruitful and Hoover presented a report to Truman that included information from 30 sources, including confessed spy Elizabeth Bentley saying that White was a 'a valuable adjunct to an underground Soviet espionage organization.' Harry White fell under the suspicions of FBI Chief  J. Edgar Hoover in 1946 - who unearthed the first evidence that the treasury official was a spy . Keen to keep tabs on White should he only be the tip of the iceberg, Hoover stressed to the president that the FBI's findings remain secret. Indeed, the day that Hoover's report was delivered on February 5, the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency approved White’s nomination to the IMF. Alarm bells rang in the White House and when Secretary of State James F. Byrnes read the report he wanted Truman to immediately withdraw the nomination and have White arrested as did Treasury Secretary Fred M. Vinson. Regardless, Truman still had a healthy distrust of Hoover and instead of allowing White to ascend to IMF managing director kept him as executive director. Knowing that appointing another American above White would alert him and his Soviet handlers, Truman searched for a solution he could feasibly pass off. This came when Vinson met with the venerable Keynes, who was the British governor of both the IMF and the World Bank. He said that Truman was not going to insist on an American head of the IMF but instead wanted an American head of the World Bank. Joseph Stalin at the Potsdam Conference --- His network of spies across the Western allied nations was enormous in the aftermath of the Second World War and included Harry White at the U.S. Treasury Department . This shocked Keynes, but it set up the precedence that continues to this day of an American head of the World Bank and a European head of the IMF. Ultimately though it worked in not alerting the Soviets that they might be onto White and he resigned the next year from the IMF in 1947. The following summer, in August 1948, White was officially accused of spying for the Soviets and brought before the House Un-American Activities Committee. He denied all the charges and died of a heart attack three days later - which many suspect was brought on by the stress of the hearings. Following the trial and conviction of Alger Hiss in 1950, who was fundamental in the founding of the United Nations, Representative Richard Nixon revealed a handwritten memo of White’s given to him by Chambers, apparently showing that White had passed classified information for transmission to the Soviets. However, White's ultimate guilt was established by declassified Soviet documents in the 1990s and In 1997, the bipartisan Moynihan Commission on Government Secrecy, chaired by Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, stated in its findings: 'The complicity of Alger Hiss of the State Department seems settled. As does that of Harry Dexter White of the Treasury Department.'","Harry Dexter White represented U.S. at Bretton Woods conference in 1944 .

"Gold Coast police are preparing for a painfully long fortnight as Schoolies Week hits full swing this week. A hot weekend saw 19 arrests for antisocial behaviour and police were called to break up a brawl between two girls at Cavill Avenue in Surfers Paradise. Another fight broke out between 10 young men, with one suffering a broken nose.The mayhem is expected to increase later this week when students from NSW and Victoria join the party.

Officers arrested 35 non-Schoolies on 40 charges, mainly for public nuisance-type offences, three non-Schoolies also received fines for public drinking. 'Generally police were pleased with the behaviour of Schoolies, with only a small number of the large crowd coming to the attention of police,' a Queensland Police Service statement said. Gold Coast Schoolies advisory board chairman Mark Reaburn said up to 18,000 school leavers went through the gates of the designated entertainment hub on the beach from 7pm to midnight. A restricted area has been set up on the Surfers Paradise beach for Schoolies . The sunshine haven has been hit with a wave of teenagers after 30,000 school leavers descended on the party capital for Schoolies week . 'It’s all going as planned,' he told the Gold Coast bulletin. Up to 30,000 school leavers are expected to party at Surfers Paradise clubs and pubs on Sunday night. Grant Gehrke from Red Frogs, an internationally recognised Schoolies support organisation, says first night of celebrations he's been pretty impressed with the scope of the Schoolies behaviour. Party organisers encouraged the teenagers to keep hydrated during the festivities . 16,000 wristbands were given out to party-goers as a way of identifying the Schoolies from the 'Toolies' 'First night quiet and healthy generally,' he said, 'I would say generally say harmless fun, they settle in, scope out the place and weren’t doing too much a lot on the beach, having fun enjoying themselves.' He says there were over 16,000 wristbands given out to Schoolies, as a deterrent to identify 'Toolies' and over the week it builds. Red Frogs has a 24/7 hotline for Schoolies to contact when in need and they can support Schoolies by taking them home at night if they have lost friends. Thousands of teens partied away the night on Saturday, the official first night of schoolies celebrations on Saturday . There was plenty of entertainment on the first night of schoolie celebrations on the Gold Coast . There were 42 schoolies issued with fines for drinking in public on Saturday night .

'Give four to five tonnes out across Australia in 14 different locations, it's an ice breaker, a lot of kids are excited to have us visit their hotel.' There were 42 schoolies issued with fines for drinking in public on Saturday night . A large police presence during the week-long event will be supported by about 1000 volunteers who will mingle with revellers, keeping an eye out for trouble and offering support . 'We also give out pancake shakers, add water, each team carries, it's there to gain trust with the kids.' Red Frogs also have about eight teams to go to Bali next week. 'Volunteers there's over 1500 nationally, Victoria has four locations to kick off from Saturday, WA and Rottnest Island started today with over 100 volunteers.' Police arrested 19 schoolies on Saturday night mainly for being drunk and public nuisances, although there were eight arrests for drug offences . Police made 19 arrests at schoolies, officers also arrested 35 non-schoolies on 40 charges . One Schoolie is led away by ambulance officers . 'On the Gold Coast we have 11 support services,' said Mr Gehrke. 'For Schoolies we spread the message to take responsibility for their own actions, drink plenty of water, don’t go anywhere alone, look after friends, and don't let social media ruin your future.' Police have expressed their concerns over persistent drug dealers, peddling toxic narcotics to vulnerable teens coming of age in the party town. More than 30,000 schoolies attended Gold Coast celebrations Saturday night . Police and local support organisations for schoolies have warned kids not to put inappropriate images on social media . The young teens are seen as a hot market for money thirsty drug dealers and police believe substandard drugs may be peddled due to a string of recent crack downs on the narcotics. Speaking to the Gold Coast Bulletin, Major and Organised Crime Squad boss Detective Inspector Scott Knowles said suppliers will be looking to fill the demand and the quality of drugs would no doubt be inferior. 'They don't have quality control. Their only interest is to make money and walk away, so it's the youth who wear the consequences.' he said. There was music and festivities all night long for schoolies on the Gold Coast . Hundreds of schoolies enjoying the festivities on the first night of celebrations on the Gold Coast . A large police presence during the week-long event will be supported by about 1000 volunteers who will mingle with revellers, keeping an eye out for trouble and offering support.

Police have also cautioned Schoolies against posting inappropriate photos on social media, saying they could come back to haunt them. Authorities have said that Surfers Paradise remains a popular spot for school leavers to party, although some are choosing to head overseas to Bali and Fiji. Acting Chief Superintendent Des Lacy says the main concern was people jumping from balcony to balcony on high-rise buildings. Schoolies pause to take a water break during a big night . Schoolies dance and pose for pictures at a beach party . Sticking together: School mates take their revelry down to the beach . 'We've already seen catastrophes occur when that happens,' he told media this week. 'What we ask of young people ... (is) if you see that sort of behaviour please let us know.'

Looking for treasure : what's left behind could be a treasure for this lady . The sun is up and so are some of the schoolies, celebrations continue into the morning . Supt Lacy says his main message to those attending celebrations is to look out for one another. 'As the slogan says: `Be safe, watch your mates',' he said. He also cautioned party-goers against posting inappropriate photos online as they could be viewed by potential employers. The main concern each year was excess alcohol consumption, although schoolies had been more tame over the past few years, he said. Last year Queensland Ambulance Service staff treated about 500 schoolies within designated party precincts on the Gold Coast. Most were treated for minor injuries, such as cuts, but many were treated for alcohol intoxication and a small number were treated for illicit drug use. Assistant Commissioner Dee Taylor-Dutton reminded those attending to keep hydrated, with temperatures expected to reach the high 20s.","Sunday night of Schoolies season has kicked-off on the Gold Coast .

"It was probably unlikely that a TV comedy series about a Muslim community leader would pass without comment. And so it was that in the region of 200 complaints were made to the BBC yesterday after it broadcast the first episode of Citizen Khan. It was claimed that the programme ‘takes the mickey out of Islam’, was guilty of ‘stereotypes about Asians’ and was ‘disrespectful to the Koran’. Scroll down to watch the trailer . Controversial: The first episode of BBC comedy series Citizen Khan attracted in the region of 200 complaints . Provocative: The programme's British Muslim creator Adil Ray (second from left) stands with co-stars Bavna Limbachia (left), Maya Sondhi (second from right) and Shobu Kapoor (right) One scene that particularly provoked anger was where a heavily-made up girl, Mr Khan’s daughter, rushed to put on a hijab and pretended to be reading the Koran when her father entered. The six-part series, which aired for the first time on BBC1 on Monday at 10.35pm, has been created by British Muslim Adil Ray, who also plays the lead role. One viewer wrote on the BBC’s messageboard: ‘This is terrible stereotyping, ignorant and just dreadful.’ Another said: ‘HIGHLY disappointed especially when her father walks in and she dis-respectfully opens the Koran!!’ But others defended the show. One . said: ‘People are reading too much in to Citizen Khan, especially the . hijab thing, it happens!’ Complaints: The series, which follows the fortunes of a Muslim community leader, has been accused of being 'disrespectful to the Koran' Family argument: The first episode was about the troubled wedding plans of one of Mr Khan's daughters . ‏@Saduf_I: Caked in makeup, a sleeveless top & tight clothes? A pathetic portrayal of a hijabi. The hijab defines modesty. This isn't it. @Sana_Choudery: Why did they have to make the hijabi like that? #citizenkhan Insult to all hijabis! ‏@_Raja_Talat_ : Citizen Khan is very disrespectful.. they crossed the line when they brought religion into it. @MarwaZiane: Citizen Khan is honestly the dumbest show EVER. It's not even funny & quite disrespectful.‏@sayeedahassan1: When will BBC stop with racial sterotyping? Re:citizen khan ‏@Original_Ted: Citizen Khan is just s***, why try make Islam look like that? ‏@kalrlz: I was so disgusted with that Citizen Khan sitcom aired yesterday. Shame on the person who thought of such a concept.‏@j_sabre: Aaliyah on Citizen Khan? That stereotype does exist, it exists for a reason. Because its true! ‏@BAPB00: I watched Citizen Khan.. And it is quite rude and i can see why people are getting offended but its alllllll trueee . The . series stars former My Family actor Kris Marshall as the mosque manager . and Shobu Kapoor, who is known for her work on EastEnders, who plays Mr . Khan’s wife. The comedy mocks Mr Khan’s self-importance, including his delusions about his position in the community and about his standing in the business world. Critics have complained that it repeats many stereotypes about British Muslims, with the first episode all about the troubled wedding plans of one of Mr Khan’s daughters, Shazia. Some claimed while Goodness Gracious Me, the acclaimed BBC2 Asian sketch show, had challenged stereotypes, the new show reinforced them. The two other writers on the show, Anil Gupta and Richard Pinto, had both worked on Goodness Gracious Me. A BBC spokesman said: ‘Citizen Khan has made a very positive start, launching successfully with 3.6million viewers and a 21.5 per cent share in a late-night slot. 'New comedy always provokes differing reactions from the audience. The characters are comic creations and not meant to be representative of the community as a whole.' In a recent interview with BBC Breakfast, Mr Ray said the show was allowing the Muslim community to laugh at itself. He said: 'I think it is a great opportunity, with Mr Khan as a Pakistani Muslim and the character, to take that kind of really rich content and laugh at ourselves and I am a firm believer in that.'

"Reindeer owners are attempting to keep the locations of Christmas displays secret to avoid intervention from animal rights activists. The Cairngorm Reindeer Herd in Aviemore has supplied animals for festive parades across the country for decades. But, after animal rights group PETA bombarded local authorities with letters asking they do not use the  animals in Christmas events, the herd has asked well-wishers not to reveal which displays they plan to attend. Scroll down for video . The Cairngorm Reindeer Herd in Aviemore has asked people not to mention where they will appear in Christmas parades this year to avoid possible intervention from animal rights activists . In November, PETA, which stands for People For the Ethical Treatment of Animals, issued a letter to several councils condemning the use of reindeer in Christmas pageants. The Cairngorm Reindeer Herd participates in events hosted by some of the local authorities which received the letter. But the herd fears it is being considered in the same way as organisations which transports thousands of reindeer from Scandinavia into captivity. In a bid to avoid any intervention or disruption, it asked fans on its Facebook page not to refer to the locations of its jobs on the social media site. 'Can we ask you all to please not mention any the locations of any of our Christmas parades here on Facebook, as we don't want any of their organisers to get targeted by animal rights folks. 'We know our reindeer are very happy and comfortable in their work - otherwise we wouldn't take them to the parades - as we are the ones who work with them day in, day out and know them all extremely well,' a post on November 1 read. The group is the only free-roaming herd in the UK and has participated in Christmas events for decades . Speaking of the unusual request, worker Tilly Smith said: 'We feel it would open a can of worms if we publicised where we are going. 'We're erring on the side of caution by asking people not to mention details. We believe the protesters are aiming to stop venues from hiring us. 'These places might decide they can't be bothered by the hassle and will stop inviting us. It's putting pressure on them. 'Without the money we make from this time of year, we would struggle to care for the reindeer and pay our staff. 'We feel worn out by it all, to be honest. The reindeer bring a huge amount of joy, but there's a blackness in the background just now because of it.' Campaigners slammed the request, saying organisers were trying to hide 'unethical displays'. 'When someone asks their customers to be secretive, you know they've got something to hide,' Ben Williams, a PETA spokesman said, rejecting the group's claim that they are a free-roaming herd. 'Reindeer are not ""free-roaming"" if they are being carted all over the country, jammed into pens, tied up with reins, and forced to pull sleighs. 'We should not be supporting such unethical displays. Children should not grow up thinking that animals exist merely for our entertainment or that they must work for their upkeep. 'The holiday season is supposed to be about joy and peace. Ending the exploitation of reindeer and other animals would do nothing to diminish children's sense of the magic of the holiday season.' Earlier this year PETA campaign coordinator Kirsty Henderson penned a letter to numerous local authorities asking them not to involve reindeer in parades she deemed 'entirely unsuitable'. 'A busy commercial centre filled with noisy shoppers, bright lights and excited children is an entirely unsuitable environment for reindeer or any other animals. 'These beautiful animals belong in the Arctic and subarctic regions of the world.' Owners say their animals are 'very happy and comfortable in their work'. The reindeer are pictured in their free-roaming habitat in the Scottish Highlands where tourists can visit them throughout the year . Animal rights group PETA argues it is unsuitable for reindeer to be around 'bright lights and excited children' The group said the species 'belongs in the Arctic and subarctic regions of the world' and not in town centres . While the Cairngorm Herd acknowledges there are organisations which import reindeer to poor conditions in the UK, their animals are not unhappy with the work they carry out and bring 'a huge amount of joy' 'When they’re used as holiday ""props"" reindeer are denied the opportunity to engage in natural behaviour or roam freely over vast open ranges as they would in their natural circumpolar habitat,' The reindeer from the Cairngorm Herd are the only ones in the country which enjoy a free-roaming habitat in the Scottish Highlands. During the year they are visited by groups of tourists in the wild, and, say organisers, interact with humans willingly. When travelling to events across the country, they stay in temporary, farmland bases and are transported in lorries with spacious boxes of straw.","The Cairngorm Reindeer Herd has asked people 'not to mention' its events .

"Google has . backed down in a row over free speech by re-instating links to news . stories it had previously stripped from the internet.

But . links to articles which had previously been deleted have now . re-appeared on the website after public outcry at what many viewed as . unacceptable censorship of the internet. Google has reinstated links to news articles after accusations a new ruling on the 'right to be forgotten' was leading to unacceptable censorship of the internet . Earlier . this week, MailOnline reported how links to a number of completely . accurate news stories had disappeared from Google's search results . following requests using a controversial European Court of Justice . ruling. The . changes meant anyone searching for information through the search . engine would have been completely unaware the news stories existed.

The webpage had been among the first removed from Google after the new rules came into force. MailOnline understands that links to articles on other news websites have now also been reinstated. Google . has declined to comment on the re-appearing links, but this morning . insisted the process of deleting search results was still 'work in . progress'. Links to a MailOnline article about Scottish referee Dougie McDonald, who lied about a penalty incident, have been re-instated on Google following outcry at so-called 'right to be forgotten' rules . Head of communications Peter Barron told the BBC: 'We have to balance a whole range of things - . free expression, privacy and the public's right to know. 'This . is new territory for us all. We opposed the ruling. There's no right of . appeal in the ECJ but we think it's important to have a public debate . about this.

It . emerged earlier today that Google now has a backlog of more than . 250,000 censorship requests to deal with and is deleting links purely . because people did not want their comments on news stories to be viewed . online. Mr . Barron said: 'The European Court of Justice ruling was not . something that we welcomed or wanted, but it is now the law in Europe . and we are obliged to comply with that law. Google's Peter Barron today said the new law is not something the company 'wanted or welcomed' 'We . are aiming to deal with it as responsibly as possible.

It emerged today that the page was not hidden in response to a . complaint from the bank or Mr O'Neal, but a request from a member of the . public who posted a response to the blog and no longer wanted it to be . available to people searching his name. Mr . Barron acknowledged that Mr Peston's article was 'very much in the . public interest', but said: 'It relates to an ordinary member of the . public who left a comment on Robert's blog - maybe something . embarrassing - and he contacted Google and asked to have that page . revealed. 'If . you search for Merrill Lynch it will appear. If you search for Stan . O'Neal it will appear. Only if you search for the very narrow term of . the name of the individual commenter would it not appear.' Mr . Barron added: 'We have to balance the need for transparency with the . need to protect people's identity as well. In all cases where we remove . content, we let the webmaster of the site know that we've removed . content.' Mr . Peston said it was 'a bit weird' that his article could be blocked . because an individual regretted a comment he had voluntarily posted . years ago. He . said: 'People voluntarily put things up. Nobody coerces them to leave . comments on my blog. I just think it's slightly odd that there should . now be a law in place that basically says if you feel a bit embarrassed . about what you said, you can hide yourself. 'I'm not . saying it's Google's problem, but it does seem to me to be something a . bit weird about a world in which you can allow people to cause enormous . bureaucratic difficulties for all the search engine companies and lots . of uncertainty about what can be found and can't be found, just because . they feel a bit embarrassed about what they said a few years earlier.

"The brother of a missing teenager claimed he was threatened by police when he told them he believed they had covered-up his disappearance. Kevin Allen’s 15-year-old brother Martin disappeared in November 1979. The son of the chauffeur to the Australian High Commissioner, Martin vanished on his way home from King’s Cross Station to his home in Kensington. Scroll down for video . Martin Allen (pictured) was abducted thirty years ago in London and has not been seen since. He disappeared on his way home from school on Guy Fawkes Night in 1979 - his brother claims he was threatened by police . But the Sunday People reported that when Mr Allen pushed for more to be done on the case, saying he believed a top level cover-up was hiding the circumstance of the teenager’s disappearance, he was told to ‘stop talking like that, you might get hurt.’ Mr Allen, 51, now believes the files relating to Martin have been destroyed or lost to avoid solving the mystery that has haunted his family for 35 years. Speaking to the Sunday People yesterday, he said: ‘I’ve no faith in the police. They failed us. ‘Within a couple of months of Martin disappearing, my father said: “There’s something not right here.” 'Police weren’t doing enough. They went through the motions. ‘So it didn’t surprise me when a senior officer warned me I could get hurt.’ Mr Allen said he always believed there was ‘Establishment involvement’ in his brother’s disappearance. Martin’s disappearance has been linked to the notorious Elm Guest House in Barnes, south west London, and the alleged VIP paedophile brothel is now being re-investigated.

Vishal was also walking home when he disappeared in 1981, parts of his dismembered body were recovered months later in woodland.

"A mother who shot her three children at their home in New Jersey before turning the gun on herself has died form her injuries, police have confirmed. Unemployed nurse Jeannine LePage used a pillow to muffle the sounds of gunfire when she killed her 14-year-old son Nicholas Harriman and his eight-year-old sister Nadia in Tabernacle on Thursday. Her other son, Alexander Harriman, 11, is currently in critical condition in hospital. A relative who was in the house at the time but didn't hear the shooting, found the four family members in bed in their mother's room upstairs. LePage was taken to hospital but New Jersey state police confirmed that she died on Sunday. Reports have suggested that LePage was having financial difficulties at the the time. Authorities are also investigating whether one of the victims sent a text to a friend on the day of the shooting, saying he would not be in school because his mother was 'having a bad day'. Scroll down for videos . Family tragedy: Jeannine LePage, 44, is accused of shooting dead her 14-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter, and wounding her 11-year-old son, before turning the gun on herself in New Jersey . Scene: Members of law enforcement are seen outside the Tabernacle home where two children were found dead and a woman and another boy were found injured . Nicholas appeared to have posted a picture of a gun on his Instagram account earlier this year, however it is not known whether it was used in the shooting. State police said they received a call from another relative in the home at about 9.15am Thursday reporting that the mother and children had been shot. Jeannine LePage, 44, had a single shot to her head; officials would not say where the children were shot. All were found in the same room, and a revolver believed to have been the only weapon used was found, police said. LePage and her 11-year-old son, Alexander, were taken to Cooper University Hospital in Camden. Officials described them both as being in ‘extremely critical condition,’ suggesting that they are not expected to survive. Victims: Nadia Harriman, eight, (left) and her brother Nicholas Harriman, 14, were shot dead in bed at the hands of her own mother, according to police . Weapon: Nicholas appeared to have posted a picture of a gun on his Instagram account, however it is not known whether it was used in the shooting. The gun used was owned by a deceased member of the family . Five other people live in the home, but authorities say none reported hearing any shooting because the mother used a pillow to muffle the sounds of gunfire. Authorities said all the other residents of the home had been accounted for. During a press conference Friday, State police Detective Geoff Noble said LePage used a handgun that had been purchased legally and was in the family for decades. Authorities have not said what prompted the mother to shoot her children. ‘We may never know with certainty, depending on the condition of LePage, what that motive was,’ New Jersey State Police Captain Stephen Jones said. ‘That's something we're not prepared to address right now.’ After autopsies of the two children, police were able to narrow the time frame of the shooting to somewhere between 5am and 9am Thursday. The Burlington County community is located in the sparsely populated New Jersey Pinelands, about 30 miles east of Philadelphia. Victims: One of two children's bodies are taken from the crime scene after the shooting . Crime: A police line is secured in Tabernacle, where the four shooting victims were found inside a home . Distraught: A woman covers her hand as she speaks with investigators on Thursday . Neighbors said they did not know the residents of the house and did not hear any commotion Thursday morning until troopers arrived and helicopters began hovering overhead. 'It's very quiet, peaceful,' said Mike Watson, who has lived in the neighborhood for 25 years. 'You can hear a pin drop.' The family's next-door neighbor, Jeanne Snedeker, was upset by the shooting, particularly Nadia's death. ‘It's hard for me when I sit in my sunroom and look out my window,"" Snedeker said Friday. ‘I can picture her running by and waving.’ Snedeker said the girl was outgoing and always smiling. She said she did not know their mother well. She did recall a conversation they had in the past year or so about their mutual interest in rescuing animals. About 200 people attended an emotional candlelight vigil for the family Thursday night in Tabernacle. Search: Authorities looked at a sword in a trunk of car at the crime scene . Discovery: Also recovered was another weapon in the vehicle's trunk . Address: New Jersey State Police Capt. Stephen Jones, pictured, said the shootings occurred sometime between the overnight and 9am . Police: New Jersey State Police Troopers were seen speaking to a neighbor in the community on Thursday . Sources tell the Bucks County Courier Times that Mrs LePage was a licensed nurse, but according to her best friend, Monique Currier, LePage was unemployed and struggling to make ends meet. Speaking to ABC6, Currier recalled that a few months ago LePage had confided in her that if things got really bad for her, she would take her own life. LePage had been living in Tabernacle with her brother and his family. The father of her three children reportedly lives in Maryland. LePage’s oldest son, Nicholas Harriman, was a freshman at Seneca High School in the Lenape Regional High School District. His sister, Nadia, and brother, Alexander, attended schools in Tabernacle. Investigators are now trying to confirm reports that one of the victims allegedly sent a text message Wednesday saying they would not be in school because their mother was having 'a bad day.'","Police received reports of multiple shootings in Tabernacle on Thursday .

"Defence contractor Benjamin Bishop has been sentenced to more than seven years in prison for giving military secrets to his Chinese girlfriend . A former civilian defence contractor working at the U.S. military's Pacific headquarters has been sentenced to seven years and three months in prison  for divulging military secrets to his Chinese girlfriend and keeping classified documents at his Honolulu home. Benjamin Bishop demonstrated poor judgement and jeopardised national security because of an intimate relationship, said U.S. District Court Judge Leslie Kobayashi during his sentencing hearing. That he would risk everything showed the girlfriend 'has control over you', the judge told him. Bishop's move to contact his girlfriend from a halfway house he was allowed to stay at while awaiting trial, even though he was forbidden to do so, showed a continued lapse of judgement, she said. 'This makes the court question your ability to follow the law when it comes to this person,' Judge Kobayashi said. Bishop, 60, will get credit for about a year he's already spent at the federal detention centre in Honolulu since his arrest in March 2013. He faced up to 10 years in prison for each of two counts - communicating national defence information to a person not entitled to receive it and unlawfully retaining national defence documents and plans. Defence attorney Birney Bervar argued Bishop should be sentenced to time served. 'He made an error, a serious error in judgement over the love of a woman. As one of his friends said in a letter quoting Shakespeare, ""he loved not wisely, but too well,""' Mr Bervar told reporters. The girlfriend was a Fulbright scholar working on her doctorate in security issues at a U.S. university. Bishop pleaded guilty in March, saying he mentioned a classified conference between U.S. and South Korean officials while responding to an email from his girlfriend, who is 27. He also admitted to keeping classified documents at his home, including ones outlining the U.S. Pentagon's China strategy and the U.S. military's force posture in Asia and the Pacific. Bishop's home in Kapolei, Hawaii, where authorities found secret documents he was not supposed to have . Bishop told Judge Kobayashi his only intent was to help his girlfriend, whom he called a 'brilliant academic'. 'In my efforts to help her, I went too far and made mistakes,' he said. In February last year, the woman asked Bishop what western countries knew about a Chinese naval asset. This fell outside the scope of Bishop's work but he conducted open source record research for her and collected and reviewed classified information on the topic, an affidavit said. Bishop's security clearance required him to disclose his contacts with foreign nationals, but the affidavit says he failed to let officials know about his relationship with the woman. Bishop's lawyer Birney Bervar quoted Shakespeare's Othello, saying 'he loved not wisely, but too well' Bishop worked in the field of cyber defence at the U.S. Pacific Command in Hawaii from May 2011 until his arrest. Before that, he helped develop Pacific Command strategy and policy. He retired from the U.S. Army Reserve as a lieutenant colonel a year ago. Authorities have not released the girlfriend's identity or whereabouts, or said publicly whether they believe she was working for the Chinese government. She was a Chinese national and living in the United States as a student, according to the FBI. Assistant U.S. Attorney Ken Sorenson told the court Bishop should have known better as an experienced Army officer, noting countries use sexual relationships to gather military secrets. 'All of the warning signs were there and he disregarded them,' Mr Sorenson said in court. He said the girlfriend made Bishop her pawn, as she had him research classified documents to give her information. Mr Sorenson called the sentence fair. 'We think it sends a message that individuals who compromise U.S. national security by disclosing classified information are going to face severe sanctions,' Sorenson told reporters.","Benjamin Bishop, 60, showed poor judgement and jeopardised national security because of the relationship, Judge Leslie Kobayashi said .

"Taxes on children's flights will be abolished, leading to major holiday savings for families, if a proposal said to be supported by David Cameron is approved. As it stands, Air Passenger Duty adds a minimum of £52 to flights for a family of four to a destination in Europe such as Spain or Italy, with tickets for two children under the age of 12 accounting for £26 of that additional cost. For flights to the United States and Canada, North and Western Africa, the Middle East and Russia east of the Ural ranges the ADP rises to £276, £138 for two children, while that cost stretches to £388, £194 for the kids, to places including Australia, Singapore and Indonesia. The Air Passenger Duty paid by an average family of four with two children could be slashed by half . Over 30 aviation, tourism and business groups have banded together to propose the  removal of the tax to make their airports or cities more attractive to travellers with a significant proportion of MPs backing the calls. Airports including Heathrow, Gatwick, Newcastle, Bristol and Manchester airports, airlines such as British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, along with workers' union Unite and Chambers of Commerce in London and Scotland are pushing for the abolition of the tax. The just-launched Scrap The Tax On Family Flights campaign says the tax on children's flights is an unfair burden placed on families by the Government. Families pay an average of £52 for a short-haul flight and £276 for a long-haul flight under current laws . For a family of four with two adults and two children under 12, you pay: . Europe, Russia (west of Urals): £52 (£26 for the children) Within the UK: £104 (£52 for your children) North America, North and Western Africa, Middle East, Russia (east of Urals): £276 (£138 for children) Caribbean, Central/South America, Asia (not Singapore), East Africa and Southern Africa, Indian Ocean: £340 (£170 for children) Australasia, Oceania, Singapore, Indonesia: £388 (£194 for children) Average short-haul: £52 (£26 for children) Average long-haul: £276 (£138 for children) Getting rid of the tax for flights for kids will 'make an annual holiday more affordable for hardworking families, at a minimal cost to the Government', claims the campaign. They say the the move would cost the Treasury just 1.6 per cent of the £3billion in APD incomed predicted for next year, which equals approximately £50million. British families pay more tax to fly away for a holiday than anywhere else in the world, and more than three times as much as German passengers and 30 times what French passengers pay. Only four other European countries place a comparable levy to the UK while the Netherlands, Denmark and the Republic of Ireland have all removed their departure taxes. British families pay more tax to fly away for a holiday than any other country in the world . The Scrap The Tax campaign invites families to use their online calculator to work out what they would pay for a holiday abroad, and to forward their results onto their local MP. Mr Cameron is said to have supported the idea when it was raised by Andrew Bridgen at a Tory MPs meeting in October. The Sunday Express quotes the Prime Minister's response to Andrew Bridgen when the North West Leicestershire MP brought up the subject in that gathering: 'I really like this one. I have three children under 10 myself.' It is said 33 MPS support an early day motion to have the flight tax for children axed while the proposal has been put forward to George Osborne for consideration for use in the Chancellor's Autumn Statement on December 3.","Air Passenger Duty costs an average family of four £52 for a short-haul trip .

"Taken: Lisa Irwin was taken from her parents home in Kansas City in October 2011 and they have now expressed their hope that the little girl known as Maria rescued in Greece might be her . A couple who had their daughter taken from their Kansas City home more than two years ago have revealed that they have contacted Greek authorities hoping that the missing girl known only as Maria could be theirs. As the search for Maria's identity widened into an international appeal, Jeremy Irwin, 31, and Deborah Bradley, 30, who lost their daughter Lisa in October 2011, were reported by Greek authorities to be one the eight leads - four of which are from the U.S. - out of thousands they are taking extremely seriously. Attorney John Picerno, who has represented Irwin and Bradley since their daughter disappeared from her bed after an apparent home invasion, confirmed they were one of four American inquiries about Maria, but refused to go into further detail. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Picerno said, 'We inquire about every child that is found and fits the age profile of Lisa. 'We investigate all leads. I don't have any further comment at this stage.' Little Lisa Irwin's disappearance hit the headlines across the nation in October 2011 when she was reported missing by her father when she was only 11 months old. She would be three-years old in November and her eyes bare more than a passing resemblance to those of Maria, the girl rescued from a Greek gypsy camp in Tabakou on Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Father and daughter: This is Jeremy Irwin and his daughter Lisa before she was abducted at the age of 10 months from her home in Kansas City, Missouri . Pictured: Eleftheria Dimopoulou, 40 with husband Christos Salis and little Maria, the Roma couple under arrest in Greece over the alleged abduction of Maria, the blond girl discovered by police at a Roma camp in Farsala, near Larissa, central Greece . Age-progression: On the left is how the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children imagines Lisa would look and on the right is little Maria from Greece . However, it is thought that while the two little girls share physical similarities, Maria is estimated to be around four or five years old although no official age has been confirmed. KMBC, the local news station in Kansas City, produced in conjunction with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children an age-progression image, which projects what Lisa may look like now. And last year, a tantalizing clue was brought to the attention of the Today Show. In early November, 2011, just over a month after Lisa vanished, Irwin said his debit card was stolen. The card was suspended after he noticed a fraudulent charge for $69.04 made to a British website that advertises a service to legally change your name or your child’s name online. Fraud: One month after his daughter's disappearance Jeremy Irwin discovered his credit card had been used to pay money to a British website that alters names by deed-poll . Meanwhile, today in Greece, Hristos Salis, 39, and Eleftheria Dimopoulou, 40, the gypsy couple accused of abducting Maria appeared in court to be charged with child abduction and forging birth documents. Her case has attracted global attention, with thousands of calls from people who believe they may know her identity. The child – nicknamed ‘the blonde angel’ by the Greek media – was discovered last week when police raided a gipsy camp. DNA evidence proved she was not related to the couple. Abducting a child under the age of 14 carries a maximum sentence of ten years. The forgery charges relate to fake child birth certificates and two false identities used by Dimopoulou. Baby blue eyes: Jeremy Irwin and Deborah Bradley have notified authorities in Greece that their Lisa could be little Maria . Smiles: Deborah kisses her little girl Lisa before her disappearance in October 2011 . Back in the United States, Lisa's disappearance was not without controversy though - Bradley claimed that an intruder must have taken her daughter from her bedroom while she was asleep in the same room - having consumed a large amount of alcohol. A witness said that he saw a man carrying around a baby in a diaper down the street around the time Lisa went missing . Earlier this month, before the rescue of Maria from the camp in northern Greece, Deborah Bradley and Jeremy Irwin held a candle-lit vigil to mark the second anniversary of her disappearance. Despite the family's determination, authorities in Kansas City said before this last week, tips into the disappearance have waned since the months after she vanished on October 4, 2011. 'I cannot force the people who know where Lisa is and who might have her into telling us. I have no control over that,' Bradley told the Kansas City Star. 'You do what you can for your baby, because it is your job as a parent to protect your child, and I wasn’t able to protect her from the bad guys.' Lisa was 10-months-old when her father returned from a late work shift to find the front door open, the lights on, Bradley asleep, his daughter's bedroom window open and her crib empty. They believe that someone broke into the home and snatched the baby while Bradley slept, and have said they think someone is bringing up the little girl as their own. Vanished: Deborah said that her child was taken from her house after she had fallen asleep after drinking too much . 'When somebody abducts an infant, they don't take them to hurt them,' she said. 'Wherever she is, she is being loved and taken well care of, because they went through a hell of a lot of trouble to get her.' She said that she knows people have pointed fingers at them for the disappearance but she maintained their innocence - and said it will be proven when the little girl returns to them. A private investigator continues to work on the case, and the family still offers a $100,000 reward for anyone who has information that could bring the baby home. Tragically for Irwin and Bradley, they have also revealed that her room remains virtually untouched two years after she disappeared without trace. Both Deborah Bradley and Jeremy Irwin have tried to keep a high media profile in the two years since their Lisa's disappearance. Initially, police assumed that they were involved in their daughter's abduction and told Bradley that she failed a lie detector test. Appeals: John Picerno, (left) who has represented Irwin and Bradley (center) appear on the Today Show in 2012 to appeal for the return of their child Lisa . 'They said I failed a polygraph test,' Bradley, 25, told the Associated Press in the immediate weeks after Lisa's October, 2011 disappearance. 'And I continued to say that's not possible because I don't know where she's at and I did not do this.' They said police have treated them like suspects and that Bradley in particular has been preparing for the possibility of charges being filed against her. The mother said detectives told her: 'You did it. You did it. And we have nothing.' The parents say they discovered their front door unlocked, a window open and house lights blazing, lending credence to the theory that the baby may have been snatched by an intruder. 'The main problem I think that we're facing is that everybody (else) has an alibi,' Irwin said. 'I was at work. I've been cleared. All these other people we were worried about ... the FBI said they've been cleared. The only one you can't clear is the mother that's at home when it happens `cause there's nobody else there.'

"During his Monty Python days he poked fun at everyone from the Establishment to Christianity. But thanks to the threat of ‘heavily armed’ fanatics, Michael Palin has admitted there is one comedy taboo he is too scared to break- Islam. The 70-year-old said religious sensitivities have increased so much since his comedy days it would now be impossible to make 1979 film Life of Brian - which satirised the life of Jesus - let alone laugh at Muslims.

But thanks to the threat of 'heavily armed' fanatics, Michael Palin has admitted there is one comedy taboo he is too scared to break-Islam . He said: ‘Religion is more difficult to talk about. I don’t think we could do Life of Brian any more. A parody of Islam would be even harder. ‘We all saw what happened to Salman Rushdie and none of us want to get into all that. It’s a pity but that’s the way it is. There are people out there without a sense of humour and they’re heavily armed.’ In 1989, Mr Rushdie was forced into hiding after the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, issued a fatwa calling for him to be killed in revenge for his novel The Satanic Verses. Ahead of a series of live reunion shows in July, Mr Palin admitted much of his Monty Python material would now seem dated to modern audiences. But he denied the comedy troupe - which also included John Cleese, Terry Jones, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam and the late Graham Chapman - deliberately targeted people with its comedy. He said: ‘There’s probably a lot of political incorrectness in Python but we can’t rewrite it. I suppose attitudes have changed - a lot of British comedy at that time was ladies’ clothes falling off but in a rather sweet farcical way. Now what you can watch on television is incredibly explicit about sex.

We were just writing what would make the six of us laugh.” ‘There are lots of laughs to be got from the way life is. The English love embarrassment. We are the ‘sorry’ society. ‘Someone punches you in the face and you will say “I’m terribly sorry my face was there. Is your hand all right?” ‘But each generation of comedians is looking for something new. It was only very recently before Python that somebody openly made a joke about the Prime Minister. There was an establishment which still had to be respected. Now we can talk about anything ... and in an odd way it’s made us more depressed.’ Mr Palin was guest editor the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.

"Passengers have described a 'disgraceful' coach tour trip from Devon  to Scotland in which the bus driver sold alcohol to passengers and elderly travellers were verbally abused. The driver of a hired Telford's Coaches vehicle sold miniature bottles of vodka, gin and whisky from a compartment above a coffee machine on the bus for £2.50 each on a trip from Torquay run by tour company David Urquhart Travel. A 79-year-old man from West Calder, who asked not to be named, said the 14-hour trip from Torquay back to Scotland was 'disgraceful' with one passenger swigging wine from the bottle and a widow on holiday for the first time without her husband being called 'an old git'. Miniature bottles of alcohol such as these pictured were sold for £2.50 on coach tour bus from Torquay . The man, travelling with his wife, said: 'There were fancy stickers on a locked compartment saying ""buy whisky"" and ""buy gin"" beside the coffee machine in the middle of the coach. 'The driver wasn't actually selling the alcohol himself while he was driving - he had a young assistant selling it, sort of like a waitress.' The man admitted the price was 'quite reasonable' compared to normal retail or mini-bar prices, a factor which may have encouraged its purchase. 'One man had a bottle of wine, six beer cans and a bottle of vodka that he had brought on himself,' he said. 'It is difficult to determine whether someone is actually drunk or not, but the way two of these passengers were acting certainly looked like they were. A driver for Telford's Coaches, hired by David Urquhart Travel, sold alcohol to passengers . The homepage for David Urquhart Travel, which received complaints after the bus they hired served booze . 'They were standing up trying to get everyone to sing and making abusive comments. My wife said she heard them swearing. The high street at Ecclefechan, where elderly coach passengers were told they were only upset because they were tired by passengers who'd been drinking . 'There was a lady on the coach that was a widow and it was her first holiday on her own without her husband and the drunks were calling her ""an old git"", 'It wasn't nice. 'When we got to Ecclefechan, the drunks were telling us all we were just upset because we were tired. 'Actually we were upset because they were being so disruptive.' He added: 'I was just trying to have a rest, sitting back with my neck cushion, when one of the men turned round and said to me I was sitting with my nose in the air. He was being such a nuisance.' Unimpressed passengers have attempted to seek compensation for their unsavoury trip, which returned on August 30 this year, but have been told by East Kilbride-based David Urquhart Travel that it will not be forthcoming. The company's customer relations officer Ellie Elder said: 'Unfortunately, we found out about this incident after the Urquhart's tour had finished. 'Our conditions of travel state that the consumption of alcohol is not permitted on any of our tours. 'We have dealt with this matter and contacted Telford's who have dealt with the issue. 'Alistair Telford was not best pleased to hear that one of his drivers had been selling alcohol to the passengers and acting against their company policy . 'We have a long established and successful relationship with Telford's and we have been assured that nothing of this sort will happen again.' The unhappy customer, who had stayed with his wife and the rest of the group for five nights at the Cavendish Hotel in Torquay, added: 'We just want to raise awareness so that this type of things doesn't happen to other passengers.' The bus made a number of stops during the journey - on one the man said while a majority of passengers visited a garden centre a number of them went to a Brewer's Fayre to keep drinking. When the bus reached Gretna at the entrance to Scotland, the bus driver who was selling alcohol swapped with another - the replacement did not continue to sell booze. The drivers changed at Gretna, with the replacement not continuing to serve alcohol . Another couple, from Falkirk, said the experience was 'hellish'. Sarah Thomson, 75, said: 'There were people buying drink from the driver and some of the passengers also brought on their own booze. 'When the coach was stopped the driver was asking people what kind of alcohol they would like and bringing it to their seat. 'We are experienced coach travellers and this is the first time we have ever been on one where alcohol was sold. 'Then things got a bit out of hand with the passengers. 'There was even talk of getting the police involved at one point things got so heated.' The tour group had spent five nights at the Cavendish Hotel in Torquay . Telford's Coaches managing director Alistair Telford said: 'I don't want to hide anything. The driver was selling alcohol. 'I have taken action to ensure that this will not happen again and the driver has been dealt with internally. 'My information is that only one passenger was drunk, and that passenger did not buy the alcohol that made him drunk from the driver. 'We have worked for David Urquhart Travel for years and have a long standing relationship with them. We do not allow the consumption of alcohol on any of our coaches.'","David Urquhart Travel tour bus journey from Torquay dubbed 'hellish'

"Have you ever wondered what you have to do to keep your man's eye from wandering? One woman thinks she has the answer - it involves a scalpel and some silicone. Self-titled sex expert Louise Van Der Velde is telling women who reach their forties to get plastic surgery or face their partner running off with a younger model. Louise, who runs a relationship therapy centre in central London, believes ladies only have themselves to blame if their husband starts to find other women more attractive. Scroll down for video . Louise Van Der Velde, 41, runs a relationship therapy centre in London, she believes women only have themselves to blame if their man cheats and should get plastic surgery to stay desirable . She said: 'I think for the people who do want to have a monogamous relationship – the women are very quick to point the finger. 'They say that their husband is messing about and he’s left them for someone else, but I think it is absolutely the woman's responsibility when they have let themselves go over the years. 'We are the creators of our own destiny, if your fella cheats, you’ve created it yourself. 'The men have a right to look elsewhere, they have a right to be sleeping with an attractive woman.' Apparently it could be worse though, while British and American women are not in good shape, Louise reserves her harshest criticism for ladies from some of the countries on the European mainland. She said: ' I lived in Spain for fifteen years and the women there, they age because they eat all of these cakes and bread. 'A lot of the women, when they hit 50 they are pretty much a write-off in some of those countries, but it doesn’t have to be that way.' Louise provides advice for women whose men have been unfaithful . Steering clear of cakes and keeping in shape with regular visits to the gym is not enough though - Louise thinks that women should start to have breast augmentation, liposuction, fillers and the rest as soon as parts of the body start to sag. She said: 'A lot of my female clients in their forties and fifties come in and they’re unhappy that their husbands are playing away but they’ve let themselves go. 'But no one’s really happy with themselves when they are overweight and not looking good. 'Even when you buy a new dress you feel good – looking good is feeling good. 'I actively encourage my clients to get plastic surgery and it’s received fairly well. 'I have had the odd client who think they should be accepted for who they are but some of them have taken it up. Louise believes women should look into cosmetic surgery as soon as their skin start to sag (picture posed by models) 'I’ve had some ladies who have had liposuction done for their weight and some who've had the gastric band. 'There are also some who've had their eyes and breasts done as well. 'Faces get saggy and a little bit of filler is good, it’s very important that you find the right surgeon though. 'Some of the TOWIE girls go totally over the top and they begin looking like this plastic. It doesn’t have to be like that. 'If you have a good surgeon, they’ll do it the right way.' Louise claims to have had serious success with her pro-plastic surgery approach to healing marriages. But sometimes the effects can be so strong that the balance in the relationship swings completely the other way. Louise thinks that men should be allowed to look elsewhere if their partner has let themselves go . She said: 'This one woman had a boob job and it gave her a totally new lease of life. 'She decided that as her husband had cheated on her, she was going to go off anyway. 'I take my hat off to those types of women as well because I think that maybe they had been staying in the relationship because they had settled and couldn’t get anyone better.' While Louise acknowledges that her comments may seem harsh and quite extreme, she is quick to point out that she practises what she preaches and has undergone extensive cosmetic surgery herself. She said: 'People say to me it’s easy because I am a natural beauty but I work really hard to look like this. 'I decided that in my fortieth year I wanted to be the fittest I’ve ever been, so I had my boobs done. 'I  first had them done eight years ago, back then I was a 34C and went up to a 34DD and now I’m a 34 E. 'I also had under my eyes done – I had the wrinkles taken out, I’ve  also had my lips done. 'Everybody says that they can’t believe I’m 40, they all think that I look like I’m 30 and that’s a great feeling. 'I don’t believe in growing old gracefully.' It seems that Louise isn't alone in her desire to stay looking fresh as soon as the big 4-0 looms, more and more surgeons are experiencing the an influx of forty-something women checking in for adjustments. Mr Ash Mosahebi, who performed Louise's surgery at Spire Bushey Hospital said: 'I have seen a rise in patients wanting to remain younger at a younger age. 'Previously women would have come to see me in their fifties or sixties, I am now seeing more women in their forties. The most popular procedures for women of this age are breast uplifts, liposuction and blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery).' The most popular procedures for women in their forties are breast uplifts, liposuction and blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery) There are some who ARE allowed to grow old gracefully though - Men. While women should get plastic surgery to hide the signs of ageing, Louise believes that men only need to keep in shape by eating well and heading to the gym. She said: 'I think men are more fortunate, they age better than women and they become more distinguished. 'So obviously they need to keep themselves fit, but as far as surgery, they get away with lines and things like that. 'I don’t think there is as much emphasis on the men needing to do it.'","Louise Van Der Velde, 41, runs a relationship therapy centre in London .

"A mother has been charged with murder after allegedly killing her 18-month-old twins by drowning and smothering them, and attempting to poison their four-year-old sister to death. This heartbreaking picture shows the moment one of the toddlers was carried from the Tacony, Philadelphia home where the horrendous killings occurred on Thursday afternoon. Stacey Smalls, 41, is believed to have committed the crimes as she was in a jealous rage over an affair she thought her husband was having with another family member. She has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder, according to police. Scroll down for video . Police officer carries a body from a house in Northeast Philadelphia where toddler twins were found dead in their home . Her Facebook profile has a picture of a car with the words 'Hope she was worth it' sprayed across the side, showing her anger at the alleged cheating. Her husband, Ron Smalls, returned to their home after work as a corrections officer and found the children's bodies and his wife with her wrists slashed. He frantically called 911 at 4 p.m. and told police his wife had killed their babies and tried to poison their four-year-old daughter. When police arrived at the scene they found the woman who told them: 'I harmed my babies.' The 18-month-old twins, Adam and Eve, were found limp and lifeless on a bed in the front bedroom. They were pronounced dead at 4.10 p.m. Police say they appeared to have died of suffocation. Four notes next to the children read, 'This is why I killed your kids,' and detailed the mother's allegations of the husband’s affair, ABC reported. 'She had something she felt was justification but there is no justification,' Police Commissioner Charles Ramsay said. 'It’s a tragedy two young babies dead and there is no excuse for that.' Victims: The 18-month-old twins, Adam and Eve (left), were found dead on a bed after apparent suffocation. Their four-year-old sister (right) is believed to have been poisoned by prescription pills . Innocence: One twin is believed to have been drowned while the other is believed to have been smothered . Police believe she gave her four-year-old daughter prescription pills. The young girl was reported to be in a stable and good condition at St. Christopher's Hospital for Children. Doctors were working to determine exactly what substance her mother had given her. Police added that Smalls, who worked as a nurse at a nursing home, had apparently made attempts to take her own life by slashing her wrists. On her Facebook page there are signs of a troubled marriage. She announced her marriage to Ron Smalls on December 17, 2010, but changed her relationship status to 'divorced' on May 19. Her profile picture is an image of a car that she downloaded from the internet. Words sprayed across the side of the car read: 'Hope she was worth it.' Of the photo, she added: 'I liked her style'. Both Stacey and her husband have uploaded pictures of the youngsters. On one of Ron's pictures of his daughters, he wrote: 'Sisters, what a beautiful thing'. But on Wednesday, just one day before the slayings, Stacey wrote on the picture: 'Really, sisters what a beautiful thing. I guess it depends on which sister' - perhaps in a nod to Ron's alleged affair. 'Killer': Stacey Smalls (left) is thought to have killed her twins (right) in a jealous rage after her husband allegedly had an affair with another family member . Anger: Her Facebook profile picture shows an image she uploaded from the internet of a car scrawled with the words 'Hope she was worth it' - in a nod to her husband's alleged affair . On Friday, just one day after the deaths of his children, Ron Smalls dumped items - including their playpen, toys and highchairs - on the curb outside the home as a trash truck pulled up. He told NBC 10 he was not ready to talk about the deaths but that his eldest daughter was stable. Despite the public declarations of problems in the marriage, neighbours and coworkers said Stacey Smalls had appeared to be herself in recent days. Tina Brown, who works with Smalls at River's Edge Nursing Home, saw her at work the morning of the killings - and said there was no sign of anything wrong. 'She said, ""Hey, it's a good day."" That's all. She said, ""Hi Tina, have a good day at work"" and she left. She didn't seem stressed out or anything like that,' Brown said. Neighbors were also shocked by the grisly scene and described Smalls as a pleasant woman. Shocked: Neighbors break down at the ghastly scene where a mother suffocated her toddler twins . Scene: Smalls's husband Ron called 911 after finding the bodies in his Tacony, Philadelphia home . 'What was so bad that you did that?' Adrienne Birnie, told the Philadelphia Daily News. 'If you can’t take it, give your kids to a neighbour.' Other neighbors left candles and flowers on the porch where Smalls often sat with her children as they struggled to come to terms with the devastating news. Celiness Espinosa, 36, said: 'What went wrong, I don’t know. I don’t even want to imagine.' Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey added: 'It's obviously even more tragic when you have young children, year and a half old. It's a pretty sad sight.' Both Stacey and Ron Smalls were interviewed by police following the tragedy. Stacey Smalls is currently in hospital for treatment of her injuries. She will be charged with two counts of murder, Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey told NBC10.

"A Labour shadow minister yesterday accused Tom Watson of rigging the party's leadership elections.

Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Ivan Lewis (right) suggested the former Labour campaign chief Tom Watson (left) had been responsible for 'manipulating' votes . The quarrel broke out after Mr Watson, MP for West Bromwich East, posted a link on Twitter to an article he had written arguing that it would be 'disastrous' if Jim Murphy won the race to be Scottish Labour. Mr Lewis tweeted: 'It's essential that Scots decide best person to be leader of Scottish Labour. Others interfering not in the interests of the Labour Party.' Mr Watson responded: 'Presumably you'd rather they quietly elect your candidate whilst we all watch. Plus ca change.' But Mr Lewis hit back: 'I want party to choose leaders in an open democratic way. Your problem is this is one leadership election you can't manipulate. 'Point is that I was not prepared to let you do it again without challenging you. Some of us have remained silent for too long.' 'How interesting,' Mr Watson added. 'Which ones do you think I manipulated?' In 2008, after Mr Lewis criticised Mr Brown's tax policies, claims about his 'pestering' a female aide were leaked to the media by Mr Brown's spin-doctor Damian McBride. Mr Watson was last year accused of using his power in the party to try and install his union-backed office assistant as the candidate in Falkirk.","Ivan Lewis suggested former Labour campaign chief 'manipulated' votes .

"Family and friends of the Indiana aid worker beheaded by ISIS extremists were joined by politicians and prominent figures in the Muslim community at a memorial service Sunday. Abdul-Rahman Kassig, the former Army Ranger who was 26 at the time of his death, was remembered for his commitment to aid work at Butler University two days after his funeral services. 'We're not here because of how he passed,' said Hazem Bata, executive director Islamic Society of North America in Plainfield. Humanitarian: Abdul-Rahman Kassig, the 26-year-old former Army Ranger, was remembered for his commitment to aid work at Butler University . 'We're because of how he lived. We're here because of the type of man he chose to be. We're here because of his selflessness.' Kassig landed in the hands of ISIS extremists last year while delivering aid to Syrians caught in the crossfire of a ghastly civil war. At the time he was working as part of Special Emergency Response and Assistance, or SERA, a relief organization he founded in 2012 and which suspended operations after his kidnapping. His parents learned of his capture last year, though the information was not made public at the time. When Kassig appeared in a beheading video of a British aid worker, his parents recorded a video pleading for his release to ISIS militants. Kassig, who converted to Islam and changed his name from Peter during his time in captivity, inspired the Muslim community to come to his family's side. Memorial: After speeches by politicians and members of the Muslim community, photos remember Kassig's life were shown . Comfort: At funeral services held Friday, friends spoke to Paula, Kassig's mother, who had pleaded with ISIS extremists for the release of her son . The Indianapolis Star reports that at a funeral service Friday, Muslim leaders denounced ISIS violence, citing the Quran's prohibition of Muslims killing other Muslims. 'The question is, is this Islam? Definitely not. Does this group belong to Islam? No, it does not. Islam is a religion of love, mercy and peace,' said Syrian Imam Shaykh Muhammad Al-Yaqoubi. 'Encouraging killing is not Islamic,' added Imam Al-Yaqoubi. At Clowes Hall at Butler on Sunday, public figures who hadn't known Kassig got up to speak about his legacy. 'It's the spirit of believing things can get better. That together we can make a difference,' said Indiana senator Joe Donnelly about Kassig's commitment to humanitarian work.

"A stroke of luck may have helped police prevent a high-profile terrorist attack in the run-up to the Olympics, it emerged yesterday. A routine stop by officers on the M1 led to the discovery of two guns, ammunition and other weapons ‘hidden’ in a car. The discovery fuelled speculation that a . suspect terror cell planned to go on the rampage in a scaled-down . version of the Mumbai terror attacks which left 174 people dead in 2008. Seven suspected Islamic extremists were later arrested and police have been given more time to question one of them - a 43-year-old man from Kirklees, West Yorkshire, who was detained in Ravensthorpe, Dewsbury, on Thursday. Held: Three men have been charged with terrorism offences after a police operation in which firearms were found in a car stopped by police on the M1 . Police now have until July 12 to charge or release the man, or apply for more time. Officers have already been given warrants of further detention for the six other suspects, who are all from the West Midlands. The arrests deepened fears that fanatics may be plotting mass murder during the Games. Today is the seventh anniversary of the July 7 attacks in London in 2005. Security officials have said that  terrorists are most likely to attack targets outside the capital. They also concede that a strike against a major provincial town or city would be seen as an attack on the Olympics – grabbing world-wide publicity. Whitehall officials have confirmed that a target had been identified. West Midlands Police said that following the M1 traffic stop, three men aged 23, 26 and 27 from Sparkhill, Birmingham, were arrested on Tuesday morning. Three more suspects, a 22-year- old from Alum Rock, Birmingham, a 24-year-old from the Moseley area  of the city, and a 22-year-old  from Smethwick, West Midlands, were arrested on Wednesday evening. While there was a huge sigh of relief that detectives had thwarted a possible ‘spectacular’, there were concerns over the length of time it took police to discover the weapons. On guard: The country is at a heightened state of alert because of the upcoming Olympic Games . The vehicle was pulled over during a routine stop between junctions 33 and 34 on the southbound M1 near Sheffield last Saturday. It was impounded on suspicion of having no insurance, but the driver and passenger were not taken into custody and the car not searched. On Monday, the vehicle was searched by police and the arms cache discovered. It is understood a member of staff routinely patrolling the compound may have spotted something suspicious. Background inquiries on the driver and passenger then revealed they were possible Islamic extremists known to the security services. A massive operation was launched  to arrest them and several associates. The fact that five other men were arrested, as well as those in the car, led to speculation police had moved in on a list of known associates. South Yorkshire Police defended the delay in finding the weapons. It said: ‘This was a routine traffic police stop. ‘A search of the vehicle would have required grounds for suspicion. There was nothing initially to indicate that these kinds of items were being carried. Items were later discovered at the vehicle compound.’ Two firearms were recovered. Neither was automatic and they were not loaded, police said. There was also a small amount of ammunition. Detective Chief Superintendent Kenny Bell, head of the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit, said: . ‘As soon as the items were discovered in the impounded vehicle, our priority was to protect the public by pursuing and arresting those we believed to be involved.’ Police said the contents of the car, which was stopped close to the Meadowhall shopping centre, were undergoing forensic analysis and the suspects’ homes had been searched. All seven men are being held in the West Midlands. Sources said their arrests are not connected to the detention of six people in London on Thursday, who were believed to have been plotting a terrorist attack to coincide with the Olympics. According to a report yesterday, the gang may have been planning to use a sword. Officers have not ruled out the possibility that both sets of suspects were planning an attack to mark the 7th anniversary today of the July 7 attacks which claimed 52 lives. Police hope that computers and phones seized during the arrests, as well as scrutiny of the suspects’ travel movements, will provide further clues about their intentions. The arrests may help to explain the huge police response to the fake cigarette ‘terror alert’ which brought the M6 Toll to a standstill in Staffordshire on Thursday. Dozens of armed officers, troops, firefighters and bomb disposal experts swooped on the scene after a coach passenger reported smoke coming from a bag. It later emerged the alert was prompted by a passenger using an electronic cigarette which emitted a vapour. The UK terrorism threat level is unchanged from ‘substantial’, which means a terrorist attack is a ‘strong possibility’. There are two higher levels –’severe’, meaning an attack is ‘highly likely’, and ‘critical’, meaning an attack is ‘expected imminently’. Police last night revealed they have been given more time to question six men from the West Midlands who have been arrested on suspicion of planning terrorist acts. Officers now have until Wednesday to charge or release them or apply for a further warrant.Additional reporting by Chris Brooke. Killing spree: One of the Mumbai gunmen in 2008 . Britain's security services have been haunted by the spectre of a Mumbai-style terror attack on these shores for four years.In November 2008, gunmen went on the rampage in India’s largest city, attacking hotels and public buildings. They murdered more than 170 and injured hundreds more in four days of bloodshed.Since then, UK counter-terrorism officers have been braced for a similarattack.They were forced to consider how to deal with terrorists fanning out across a city, in what two ex-SAS commanders said would be akin to a ‘slow-motion 9/11’.Millions have been spent upgrading heavy weaponry available to armed response teams.More officers were trained, including a squad of 100 with automatic weapons inside the British Transport Police. It is also thought SAS teams not on duty overseas have been puton standby to deal with hostage situations.The two guns and the small amount of ammunition seized on the M1 does not bear comparison to the armoury available to the Pakistani terrorists in Mumbai. But if theywere unleashed on a British shopping centre or at a crowded sporting event – the potential loss of life could be just as horrific. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Police given extra time to question one of the men, 43, from West Yorkshire ."
"Capsicum spray did not subdue an armed woman who was shot by police at a home southwest of Sydney, police say. Police officers had been called to the home at Picton on Saturday night where a mother and son were reported to be fighting. NSW Police Assistant Commissioner Frank Mennilli said one police officer tried to use OC spray after the pair turned on officers. A 54-year-old woman was shot in the abdomen after she 'turned on police' who had come to the home to investigate reports of an argument between the woman and her son . The woman was armed according to police and was a risk to the police officers at the scene . 'Based on the circumstances I have been told the officers were in fear of being seriously injured,' she said. 'In these matters police officers have a split second to make a decision and then others will spend weeks and months to dissect that decision.' Mr Mennilli said one shot was fired by police and the woman was hit in the abdomen. The 54-year-old woman has undergone surgery at Liverpool Hospital and is in a serious but stable condition.

"A woman injured in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing who had several surgeries before having part of her leg amputated recently was discharged from a rehab facility Saturday and has vowed to run the race next year. Rebekah DiMartino. 27, said she looks forward to getting her stitches out in early December and being fitted for a prosthetic left leg. 'The prognosis is great. I chopped off what was holding me back,' DiMartino said 'The prognosis, is you'll see me running the Boston Marathon next year.' Going home! Rebekah DiMartino (center) celebrated her final day in rehab after having her left leg amputated . Her rock: Rebekah Gregory and Pete DiMartino both suffered serious leg injuries in the Boston Bombing attack, but after got married soon after the incident . Looking forward: Rebekah said she looks forward to getting her stitches out in early December and being fitted for a prosthetic left leg . DiMartino had more than a dozen operations but still dealt with lingering pain. Before the surgery, Rebekah had remained upbeat and even threw the leg a 'last supper' celebration. 'The fact that I was given a second chance at life that day is something that I will never again take for granted,' DiMartino said before the operation. 'If I have to lose my leg in that process, so be it, because I'm still here.' DiMartino was with her son Noah, now seven, and then-boyfriend, Pete DiMartino, at the finish line of the Boston Marathon in April 2013 when the two bombs detonated, killing three people and injuring  270. Months of agony: DiMartino had more than a dozen operations but still dealt with lingering pain . Thinking positive: She does not expect her loss of a limb to adversely affect the rest of her life . All three were wounded in the blast but Rebekah suffered the most extensive damage to her left leg. She had undergone 17 operations, including putting metal plates, screws and rods in her leg, and suffered a serious bone infection. Although she had been confined to bedrest or a wheelchair for much of the time since the bombings, she was able to walk down the aisle on crutches when she married Pete last year. Still, even a boot has not helped her gain strength or ease the pain in the leg, and before the operation, she said that finally losing it will be 'such a relief'. 'There is so much I could say about what I am feeling at this exact moment,' she wrote on her Facebook page before the operation. 'Am I scared? Yes. Am I sad that all our efforts for the last 18 months have failed? Absolutely. But beyond the fear and sadness there is something that surpasses it all....relief. 'I am relieved to know that this is a step forward, when I have been in limbo for so long. I am relieved that my family will no longer have to live in anticipation and worry, of what the future will hold for me. 'I am relieved that I will FINALLY be able to start the process of a FULL recovery. And I am even more relieved that I will finally just get to be Rebekah again.' She continued: 'Monday is the day that my new life begins. And I am SO excited to see what it holds.' Quirky: Rebekah has been having fun in rehab and trying to keep her spirits up in the most creative ways . Support: Just hours after getting out of rehab she went onto support her little sister in her State Gymnastics Meet . Still smiling: Rebekah DiMartino, pictured with her husband Pete (right) and other family members before her surgery two weeks ago had her left leg amputated after more than 18 months of trying to save it . Injuries: Ahead of the surgery, she shared this image, left, showing her saying goodbye to the leg. Since the bombing, she has undergone 17 operations, including having pins put in her leg, right . Saying goodbye: She posted this farewell note to her left leg on her Facebook page just days before the surgery . She had surgery November 10 at Memorial Hermann Katy Hospital to remove her left leg below the knee. She entered rehab November 14 and went home Saturday to nearby Richmond. Their Houston-area home still needs some modifications for accessibility, she said. 'I have been wheelchair bound for the last 18 months basically, so when we built our house we built it with wider doors,' said DiMartino, 27. She does not expect her loss of a limb to adversely affect the rest of her life. 'This is about to be Rebekah unleashed. They haven't seen anything yet. This is the good part of the story,' DiMartino said. 'Not only am I moving on, I am trying to do my part in changing the world while doing it.' 'I am thrilled because I am moving on with my life. I am taking away the old and bringing in the new and I just can't wait to see what it brings.' Part of that future will include running the Boston Marathon, she said. Staying strong: The couple are pictured together before throwing out the ceremonial first pitch before a Red Sox game at Fenway Park in May. She has spent much time in a wheelchair or on bedrest . Excitement: She said that her seven-year-old son Noah, pictured, was excited to have a 'part robot mom' She said her seven-year-old son has long been upset about losing her leg, but after asking her a lot of questions about her operation, that changed. 'With the biggest smile on his face he shouted ""that's so cool! I'm gonna have a part robot mom!""' she wrote on her Facebook page. Her doctors say they are hopeful that she could be taking her first steps in three months. 'I think that with that kind of attitude and drive that she'll actually do very, very well,' Dr. Bill McGarvey said. 'If we can get rid of the pain for her, I have no doubt that she's going to be successful.' She has been sharing updates on her support page, Rebekah Gregory's New Day New Hope. 'And as we approach Thanksgiving next week, my list of blessings gets longer and longer,' she wrote on Facebook on Saturday. 'But today I am just grateful that so many people use their lives to help others, and to have physical therapists that totally kicked my butt!'  ' By her side: Rebekah is pictured with Pete, whom she married in April this year - a year after the bombings .","Rebekah DiMartino, a married mother, has undergone 17 operations since the April 2013 blast and was in excruciating pain .

"British society is scared of offending a 'vocal and aggressive' Muslims, claims a former adviser to Barack Obama. Prof Lawrence Krauss made his comments after threatening to walk out of a debate hosted by an Islamic group at the University College London where organisers would not allow men and women to sit together. The Islamic Education and . Research Academy (iERA) told women to sit at the back, while men and . couples were sent to the front. Three people who objected were ordered . to leave. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Theoretical physicist and professor of physics Lawrence Krauss threatened to leave if men and women continued to be segregated . Action: University College London has banned one Muslim group after it found one group had demanded gender segregation . The public debate last week was on the subject ‘Islam or Atheism: Which Makes More Sense?’ Ignoring audience jeering, Prof Kraus told an organiser: ‘Either you quit the segregation or I’m not interested.’ He returned when staff allowed men and women to mix. Prof Krauss suggested British . people were often too polite to object to such practices. 'People are not only afraid to offend, but afraid to offend a vocal and aggressive group of people,"" he said, according to the Daily Telegraph . 'There is a segment of the Islamic community that is very vocal about this. 'The notion that these cultural norms should be carried out within a . broader society that … is free and open is a serious problem.' He added that he had not experienced such problems at a similar debate in Australia. One women said she felt uncomfortable sitting among the men. Hardline Islam groups, have posted invitations on social media sites and at university campuses to public talks in an 'unprecedented scale', according to Sharia Watch UK. Activist Hamza Tzortzis is named in the report . Prof Krauss said he respected her . feelings but added: 'You are in a public arena and not in a mosque.' He . said: 'The notion that because these cultural norms make some people . feel uncomfortable in broader society, that broader society should . accommodate that discomfort, is nonsense. 'It is the obligation of people who don't feel comfortable with that to . decide how they are going to mesh with broader society, not the other . way around.' Audience . member Dana Sondergaard later wrote on her Facebook page: ‘After watching . three people be kicked out of the auditorium . . . Dr Krauss bravely . defended his beliefs of gender equality.’ iERA spokesman Saleem Chagtai insisted men and women ‘naturally’ separate in ‘normal Islamic events’. He said: ‘There were a number of ladies who used their free will and didn’t want to sit with the opposite sex.’ UCL issued a statement saying iERA would never be allowed to hold events on its grounds again. A page from the Islamic Education and Research Academy website, which has photographs of its male speakers but none for the female speakers . Mr Chagtai later told MailOnline: 'In all normal Islamic events people . will naturally often separate themselves: men with men and women with . women. 'It is de rigueur, in a way that is not too dissimilar to . practices in Orthodox Jewish communities. 'The issue that UCL had is that it it . can't be enforced.  But because of the limited space of the auditorium, . there were a number of ladies who used their free will and didn't want to . sit with the opposite sex, so we needed to cater for that.' He . said iERA had been told by UCL that segregation was against their . ethos, and had intended 'to stick to what they said in letter and . spirit'. Mr Chagtai said his organisation was now conducting an internal investigation into what happened on the day. He . added: 'We need to take their criticism like this very seriously.  We . feel it's the honourable thing to do to see if there was anybody that . influenced segregation on the day from our staff.' Atheist writer Richard Dawkins called the segregation 'sexual apartheid' and called it a 'disgraceful epsiode'. Writing . on his blog, he said: 'University College London is celebrated as an . early haven of enlightened free thinking, the first university college . in England to have a secular foundation, and the first to admit men and . women on equal terms. Heads should roll. 'Isn’t . it really about time we decent, nice, liberal people stopped being so . pusillanimously terrified of being thought “Islamophobic” and stood up . for decent, nice, liberal values?' UCL's press office issued a statement saying iERA would never again be allowed to hold events on the university's campuses.

"Holiday homes don't come much more memorable that this Cornish bolthole, designed by IT technician Michael Collins, which remarkably resembles one of the county's icons, the Eden Project. Visitors can stay in the moon pod-like residence in St Ives, set in the middle of a private two acre lot, for £1,885 per week. The bizarre structure is located on top of St Ives town, surrounded by wildlife and frequented by herds of llamas and a goat called Billy. Michael Collins with his partner Eileen Sweeney outside the unusually-designed Escape Podz in St Ives . Michael Collins designed the Escape Podz accommodation after leaving his job at Salford University to start a new life in the south-west with his partner Eileen Sweeney. The luxury 'glamping' holiday let sleeps four and is based on a mathematical sphere known as a geodesic dome. There are two bedrooms, a kitchen, bathroom and hot tub and guests  can peer out at sweeping views through a 30ft panoramic window. While the strange shape has left some locals baffled, Michael says town planners are fully behind the  design. The spacious pod sleeps four and has two bedrooms, a kitchen, bathroom and hot tub . The first of many? Michael is already planning their second dome, but this one will be a therapeutic retreat . He said: 'I was made redundant from the University of Salford so Eileen and I decided to do something exciting in our lives. 'We had the idea of building a glamping luxury holiday let from a geodesic dome to see if there was any interest in the concept. 'We spoke to the planning department who, to our surprise, loved the idea. They agreed in principle to give us three years to trial the project, so we started to build it. The Eden Project near St Austell in Cornwall is made up of a series of biodomes that house its plants . The site, located in a former Kaolinite pit, houses plants from all around the world . 'We wanted to create an incredible, over-the-top, dream destination and I think we've achieved that.' Michael and Eileen are planning their second dome, which will be a therapeutic retreat and recovery centre for people with physical or mental health issues. Michael said: 'We've already been working with organisations like Children in Need, the National Autistic Society, Help For Heroes and loads of other good causes.

"While wolf whistling and pay inequality might rankle, it seems that not all sexist behaviour is seen as a bad thing, according to a new study. 'Benevolent sexism', where women are treated as helpless entities in need of protection, is seen in a positive light by many - particularly those women with a strong sense of entitlement. The results appeared in a study conducted by researchers at the University of Auckland and titled The Allure of Sexism: Psychological Entitlement Fosters Women’s Endorsement of Benevolent Sexism Over Time. Protective: Women are more likely to see 'benevolent sexism' in a positive light if they feel entitled . The study was set up to test part of the Ambivalent Sexism Theory, which splits discrimination against women into two varieties - hostile and benevolent. Hostile, also known as misogyny, encompasses those who see women as second class and those who think women are intellectually inferior to men as well as other obviously sexist standpoints. Benevolent sexism, meanwhile, is the term used to describe the actions of those men and women who believe females depend on their male partners for everything from money to guidance and find it difficult to exist independently. 'This research was designed to test a central part of Ambivalent Sexism Theory that has not been previously examined,' lead researcher Matthew Hammond told online magazine, PsyPost.org. '[We wanted to see] whether or not benevolent sexism is attractive to women because of its promises of benefits to individual women under the conditions of being cared for and provided for by a man within an intimate relationship.' Sexism: The hostile variant, which includes treating women as second class, is disliked by both sexes . The study, which spoke to 2,700 women and 1,600 New Zealand men, found that women with a greater sense of entitlement - in other words, those that feel they have a 'right' to the best things in life - were more likely to agree with statements such as 'Women should be cherished and protected by men.' 'Even though both men and women have these kind of ""entitled"" tendencies to be reward-oriented and status-focused — the ""cherish and protect"" attitudes of benevolent sexism seem to take advantage of these qualities in women only,' added Hammond. 'This is an example of how benevolent sexism is an insidious set of ideas which appear to exploit ""niceness"" to encourage women to hold more sexist beliefs.'

"Last year, for my 54th birthday, I acquired an invisibility cloak. It wasn’t on my wishlist, it didn’t come wrapped in a parcel, and no one bought it for me. To be honest, I didn’t even know I had it, until a conversation in the office with two of my young, male colleagues. Perched on my desk, cheerfully immune to my ‘go away’ eyes, my colleagues reeled off the results of an informal poll they had conducted on the relative foxiness of my young female staff. Many women bemoan the feeling of becoming invisible as they hit middle age . As I shooed them away, it dawned on me: as far as these pups were concerned, I was so far over the hill and down the other side that I may as well have been one of the boys. They felt able to talk freely about my much younger colleagues because I was no longer in the running for their poll — and, even more insultingly, I was presumed too old to care. Somewhere along the line, I had become invisible. The downsides of being a woman in her mid-50s have been chewed over. As well as a survey this year stating that more than two-thirds of the over-50s feel completely ignored by men, this week journalist and TV presenter Mariella Frostrup weighed in. As well as a survey this year stating that more than two-thirds of the over-50s feel completely ignored by men, this week journalist and TV presenter Mariella Frostrup weighed in . Still attractive and obviously intelligent, at 52, Mariella claims to have been made effectively invisible as soon as she hit her half-century. ‘I shed half my workload the moment 50 appeared on my CV,’ she said. And surprise, surprise, it was her TV show that went, not the radio work. Even beautiful actress Kristin Scott Thomas admits she feels ‘invisible’ while surrounded by younger starlets at the Cannes Film Festival. ‘When you’re walking down the street, you get bumped into, people slam doors in your face — they just don’t notice you,’ she says. ‘Somehow, you just vanish.’ Work-related problems are serious. But, for many of us, it boils down to one main complaint: people — specifically men — just don’t seem to notice us anymore. Eyes don’t flicker lustfully in our direction when we enter a room. No one bundles over to ask to join us in the pub. Yes, we know we’re being inconsistent here. We’re the ones who spent our 20s and 30s railing against catcalls in the street and cheesy chat-up lines in bars. So, why do we now miss the thing we once detested? Actress Susan Sarandon, now 68 and in a relationship with a man 30 years her junior, says: ‘I wouldn’t want to be 20. I know so much more and I’m much more comfortable in my skin' Well, because no one likes to feel invisible. Invisible equals insignificant. My 55-year-old friend Teresa, a drop-dead gorgeous solicitor, who has prised more stray fingers away in her time than Mad Men’s Joan Holloway, recently bumped into a man she’d previously sat next to during a day-long conference. ‘After five minutes, it became obvious he barely remembered me — he had me confused with some dumpy lawyer in her late-60s!’ she says. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it’s those who’ve spent 30 years toiling at the maternal coalface who feel the most anonymous. ‘We’re so used to defining ourselves in terms of who we are to other people that we’ve lost track of what we are to ourselves,’ says my friend Lucy. ‘Being inward-facing is partly what makes women become invisible. For me, it was caused by being overly focused on the children.’ Another friend, who is also a mum, says: ‘Sometimes, I think I just blend in with the scenery. I’m not certain I am even composed of solid matter when I’m outside of the family home . . . ’ But are we missing some of the upsides? Personally, I think it’s time our generation of women started to get a grip. As we age, we acquire wisdom and knowledge. Some of us have children and some get increased status at work. Is all this really such a terrible trade-off for sagging skin and anonymity? Really, I find it liberating that, now, I find myself caring less what others think of me. Kim Catrall said her 50s came with increased self-knowledge . One friend of mine, who we’d better just call Ms X, airily suggested this could be the ideal time to set up an international crime syndicate. ‘Who would ever notice or mistrust us?’ she joked. ‘And, just think, Interpol would never catch us — because the crime scenes would be so lovely and clean!’ Just call us The Invisibles. Indeed, this cloak confers on us a new identity. It allows us to be perceived as human beings first and women second — like we’ve always wanted. ‘At 50, what I am on the outside is [now] less of a distraction from who I am on the inside,’ says my friend Marie. ‘Women feel less competitive around me and men talk to me as an equal. As I’ve got older, it’s become easier to deal with tradesmen — it’s as if they don’t have to impress me with their manliness any more.’ Similarly, all invisibles are equal. All of a sudden, the gap between me and my most irritatingly beautiful friend becomes far less of a chasm than it was in my 20s. Indeed, even the gap between me and Kristin Scott Thomas is less of a chasm. I’ve found myself feeling warmer towards both of them as a result. And I’ve been able to reinvent myself. The last time I pulled this off was when I left home for university and found myself among a group of strangers. ‘You’re so confident!’ one hot fresher told me, blithely unaware that, for the past few years, I’d been seen as the classroom geek and disco wallflower. Invisibility means nobody will notice, object or mock if I suddenly decide I want a change of direction. Indeed, government figures show that, in the past year, more than 34,000 people over 50 have started an apprenticeship with a view to a new career. On a more frivolous level, it’s the perfect time to try out a new hairstyle, look, or hobby. Earlier this year, we were told women in their 50s were driving a boom in sales of soft-top cars. And even if the new hairstyle goes wrong, one brilliant plus to being invisible is that we no longer need to dress to pull. When she hit 50, Michelle Obama said she had ‘never felt more confident in myself, more clear on who I am as a woman’ ‘It’s such a relief not always having to make an effort to look your best for the opposite sex,’ says journalist Sharon. ‘Last week, I went away for a girls’ weekend. In the evening, we all scrubbed up well, but without any of the angst 20-year-olds have. We just wanted to have a lovely time together — not get a date.’ Yet at this point in our lives, we also know exactly how to look our best — so we can still whip off that cloak if we choose to. ‘I love being able to pop out for milk first thing — no make up, hair all over the place — knowing nobody will cast a look in my direction,’ says Sharon. ‘But if I do make an effort to glam-up, those same indifferent blokes will often do the second-glance thing and smile at me.’ When she hit 50, Michelle Obama said she had ‘never felt more confident in myself, more clear on who I am as a woman’. Actress Susan Sarandon, now 68 and in a relationship with a man 30 years her junior, says: ‘I wouldn’t want to be 20. I know so much more and I’m much more comfortable in my skin.’ And let’s hear it for the ultimate cougar, Sex And The City’s Kim Cattrall: ‘In my 50s [came] this wonderful self-knowledge. You’re not trying to be somebody else, or do something else with your life. You think: “Here I am. I’ve gone through this, I’ve survived that, and I know who I am now”.’ Could it be that, in our 50s, we have more choices? And are we more likely to be content at 55 than at any other point in our lives? Let’s all meet up for a drink to discuss it. And if we’re ignored by the barman? Who cares.","Many women bemoan  becoming invisible as they hit middle age .

"A top Conservative MP invited a paedophile business consultant to the House of Commons for lunch meetings, it has been reported. Sir Edward Leigh, 64, held meetings inside Westminster where he entertained an entrepreneur who has been convicted of making thousands of indecent images of children. Businessman Duncan Breeze was given privileged access to parliament buildings as recently as a few months ago, it has been claimed. Sir Edward Leigh invited paedophile business consultant Duncan Breeze to the House of Commons for lunch . The 39-year-old was jailed in 2007 for two years after 4,270 'sickening' images of minors were found on his computers and placed on the Sex Offenders Register for 10 years. Now out of prison, Mr Breeze - once a musician and actor - is a consultant to a company which provides income support for the unemployed, according to the Sunday Mirror. Sir Edward, who is non-executive chairman for that company, has defended the meetings and there is no suggestion that by doing so broke any rules. The MP for Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, would have had to approve Breeze's attendance in the House of Commons under strict security rules, and special pass would have been issued. He told the newspaper: 'Duncan Breeze told me he had a conviction. As far as I'm concerned, it is in the past. 'I believe in redemption and forgiveness. He has served his time. His former life is nothing to do with me.' Duncan Breeze (pictured in a head shot from his days as an actor, in 2003) was jailed for two years after thousands of indecent images of children were discovered on three computers at his home . Speaking in the House of Commons in July, the former chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said: 'Children are targeted in conflict situations for sexual attacks. 'Girls and boys make up more than half the rape cases in such conflicts and that is an appalling statistic. Imagine the appalling emotional trauma of that.' Sir Edward, who was knighted in 2013 and has been an MP for over 30 years, has also previously spoken out about 'soft jail terms', blasting them as serving 'little purpose'. Mr Breeze told The Sunday Mirror that he had met with the politician about three times at his parliamentary office and claims his conviction was raised to him before he did any consultancy work. He has maintained his innocence since the child pornography was first discovered on devices at his former home in Sandy, Bedfordshire, and his parents' home in Weston-Super-Mare, Somerset. Breeze said he had been to meetings at Sir Edward's office in Westminster on about three occasions . During his trial at Luton Crown Court, the jury was told that images were found on three computers and were made between 2001 and 2004. He was arrested in 2004 after police were alerted by Croatian law enforcement agencies . Breeze, who now lives in Oxted, Surrey, believes the pornography was downloaded by an employee and lodged an appeal through the European Court to have his conviction quashed. 'I know I'm innocent. I know I've done nothing wrong and I know I've got evidence which proves that. I just can't make the court accept that yet,' he told the paper. The consultant, who operates on an ad-hoc basis, also questioned whether he was supposed to check with every company he works with that they might be in the 'public interest'.","Sir Edward Leigh, 64, held meetings in Westminster with businessman .

"Their cheerful chirrups have been waking Radio 4 listeners up every morning on the broadcaster's Tweet of the Day programme. The early morning segment was designed to educate listeners about British bird species, with the and compiled from an official list of 600 birds compiled by the British Ornithologists Union (BOU).

Black-browed albatrosses are migratory birds but have been featured on the show . It bills itself as a 'series feature songs or calls which you are likely to hear each month, but also offers a fascinating insight into the behaviour or habits of the bird, their literary or folklore associations, stories of science or conservation success'. But one listener penned a letter to the Radio Times, complaining about the amount of 'passing migrant' species that are featured, and said that most listeners would not be familiar with it, the Daily Telegraph reported.

"Remi Ray, 28, from London . The founder of Plus-Size Fashion Weekend has spoken out about her passion for fashion and how confidence in school helped her achieve her dreams. Remi Ray, 28, from London, started working in curvy fashion in 2010 and since coming on leaps and bounds she's now been shortlisted for a Cosmopolitan Body Confidence Award. The size 16 fashion school graduate believes all women should be allowed to feel beautiful, no matter what their shape or size. In 2010, while she was in her third year studying fashion business at the London College of Fashion, she launched her popular blog, Trapped in A Skinny World, for women who often feel alienated by high-street stores. Remi faced her own potential hurdles growing up, but a strong support system meant she was always confident in her body image, business aspirations, and her love life. 'I was always bigger than all my friends,' she says. 'But when, as a teenager, I realised I wasn't like everyone else, I actually embraced it and found things that worked for my shape. I didn't have the usual problems that you hear of like bullying. I was always quite creative and fashion was always going to be my forte. I could lean on that when I was younger. 'I had a strong representation of people who were like me around me from a young age. My mum wasn't very slim but was always confident and creative - I didn't come from a family of stick thin people. 'It just means my way of shopping if different from all my friends. I might have to do more digging or go to different shops, I know loads of people who struggle in those areas. 'When I was working in River Island and was a size 16, even a size 14 was hardly stocked I had to wear men's jeans because it was so hard to get high quantities of bigger sizes - and that was only nine years ago. 'Now, though, you can go into a store much more easily to pick up a size 16 or 18 - bigger sizes are more readily available.' She may have had abundant self-confidence, but she couldn't say the same for opportunities. 'I struggled to get a job after university. 'But my final dissertation was on the plus-size concept, and I realised there wasn't a lot for plus-size women who love fashion... so Trapped In A Skinny World, and three years later, Plus-Size Fashion Weekend, naturally came about. 'I funded [PSFW] through my savings for my Masters through work in retail, such as River Island and Russell & Bromley, and charity work. 'The first one was held in Shoreditch Town hall, then The Vinopolis.' Scroll down for video . Plus-Size weekend is a big step forward for fashion week . The second annual show focussed on fashion for size 14 and up . Remi started British Plus-Size Fashion Weekend to counteract the shows which snub size 16-plus women - even though they make up a quarter of high street shoppers. This year's show saw her attend wearing a T-shirt declaring Fat Is The New Black. It was supported by Evans which, Remi says, was a particularly proud moment. 'It solidified that we're doing something special,' she says. 'Even if just one person gains more confidence as a result of Plus-Size Fashion Weekend, I will have done my job.' 'Remi joined us as a panellist when we launched the first student design competition CUT for Evans and helped us select the winning designs,' says Tom Doran, of Evans. 'Her passion and desire to change attitudes saw us working closely with Remi while she organised the second British Plus-Size Fashion Weekend and she's proved to be a force to be reckoned with. 'On the day of the actual show her slogan tee said it all. Remi is confident and passionate and strives to give bigger girls the voice they deserve and the fashion they crave.' This year, Remi launched an 8-piece capsule fashion range, carefully created to suit the needs of larger women. Hayley Hasselhoff is already leading her celebrity fan base. This year, Remi launched an 8-piece capsule fashion range - From London With Love . It consists of simple dresses with modern accents (l) Her iconic Fat Is The New Black T-shorts cost £25 (r) Available on littleblackdress.com, From London With Love consists of simple dresses with modern accents like fringing and leatherette, coming in at £150-£220. Her iconic Fat Is The New Black T-shorts cost £25. Remi's market research showed her the numbers on a clothing tag actually hold women back form shopping, so she's ditched the sizing system. 'It makes them think 'Oh, it's a 20. I don't want to wear a size 20!' she says. 'So while my clothes go from size 14-26, I don't do size labels. 'I've taken into account all the things plus-size women consider when shopping,' she says. 'For a start, they actually fit, and I've done away with traditional size labels - we have letters instead. I'm hoping it might help break down barriers.' Next year, Remi's remit is expanding to cover all niche markets - petite, plus-size and tall - to make her body-confidence mission even more inclusive . She is also launching her first pop up shop in February. The PSFW event brings together retailers, designers and consumers of fashion . Remi's passion for fashion first saw her customising clothes for friends and family aged just 14. 'It's been incredibly hard work, but I'm always left with an amazing feeling knowing that I put blood, sweat and tears into producing a brand I'm completely proud of,' she says. The volume of new plus-size lines coming out thick and fast from High Street and designer retailers alike have Remi excited for the future of curvy fashion. 'It's a new niche that's busting out the seams - the plus-size fashion world is moving leaps and bounds. 'Missguided's new plus-size range is key because their target audience crosses over multiple fashion-conscious demographics. 'Evans' CUT range is very different and quirky and worlds away from what Evans is thought to provide; just basics and staples.' But Remi doesn't think it always works, and  companies should work hard to understand a plus-size shape. 'I don't really see [Kelly Brook, who created a collection for plus-size retailer Simpy Be) as a plus-size person - she's a 12-14, and plus-size is at least 14-16... Kelly's on the smaller end. '[Unlike most plus-size women] she would probably be able to say that she can easily find clothes in ""normal"" shops... 'There's a lot of collaborations going on. They're not all going to work.' She's also passionate about bringing in fit models when deisgning a plus-szie range - rather than just grade up from a small pattern block. 'Mass fashion, though, can really get it wrong sometimes. It's good to stick to quality staples... 'Many of the plus size companies who have been in the business for a long period of time can go back to the drawing board. 'It's important to use better fit models who are a better representation of their customer. A lot of plus size people are busty. It's important to bring in fit models. You cant be grading from a size 6 to 24.' For Remi's new fashion line she cut her clothes on a plus size model who wears size 14-16 and is 'quite busty'. The Cosmopolitan Ultimate Women Awards 2014 with Baileys, hosted by Fearne Cotton, is at One Mayfair, on December 3, celebrating the nation's truly inspirational real-life women and ultimate celebrities. Remi is in the top 3 runners up for the Body Confidence Award. Fearne will be joined by judges Jameela Jamil, Millie Mackintosh, Danny O'Donoghue, Baroness Karen Brady, Dr Linda Papadopoulos and Louise Court, Editor-in-Chief of Cosmopolitan magazine. The event uses only non-skinny models and has been running for two seasons so far .","Remi Ray, 28, from London, started working in curvy fashion in 2010 .

"Kate Hudson, 22, was in Europe on the trip of a lifetime. She was mid-way through a journalism degree, and had worked hard as a retail assistant for two years to save enough money to head off on a grand adventure with girlfriends. Kate was enjoying the high life of a tourist- exercising, jumping off cliffs, riding bikes, drinking alcohol and eating anything she wanted. She travelled through London, Paris, Croatia, Prague and Barcelona. Seven weeks into her trip, she started noticing that her body was acting differently. She took a pregnancy test, and she was shocked to discover it was positive. Scroll down for video . Kate Hudson, 22, had no idea she was 36 weeks pregnant when this photo was taken on her holiday in Europe . 'I had absolutely no real clear symptoms. I was still getting regular periods. I wasn’t nauseous, no morning sickness, little weight gain, so it seemed silly to think I would be pregnant,' Kate said . Travelling alone and in Barcelona, Kate immediately called her boyfriend of 18 months, Aaron, in a fluster. 'I immediately rang and told Aaron, and although he was shocked, he was supportive and said that we could work around it, and if not, that we'd have months to prepare for having a baby,' Kate told Daily Mail Australia. He calmed her down and told her to head to a doctor to double check. While she was reasonably anxious, Kate comforted herself with the thought that if by some small chance she was pregnant, she couldn't be more than a month or two along. 'I had absolutely no real clear symptoms. I was still getting regular periods. I wasn’t nauseous, no morning sickness, little weight gain, so it seemed silly to think I would be pregnant,' Kate told The Young Mummy. The doctor had some different news to share with her. Not only was Kate definitely pregnant, but she was 33 weeks pregnant and well into her third trimester. 'I totally freaked out. I thought she said 13 weeks – not 33!' Kate said. 'I rang mum and she was so shocked. We could get over the fact that I was pregnant, but the fact I was told that I was 33 weeks was so hard to comprehend.' 'No way was I ready to have a baby. I’m only 22. No job, and no money. And no time to prepare.' 'It was so hard being away from Aaron and we really struggled being away from each other.' By this time, she was in Prague. Dealing with doctors in a foreign country all alone, she knew she had to get home. This was easier said than done, as airlines require a certificate of permission for women travelling when they are in their third trimester. The obstetrician she visited in Prague said that she would have to give birth to the baby in Europe. However Kate, a size 6 even at 33 weeks and showing no sign of a baby bump, decided to risk it and fly home the very next day. 'The baby was coming and coming fast, so I just had to prepare and get back home,' Kate said. 'When I called my mum, she said that's it, we're getting you home.' It was on that flight home that Kate felt the baby kick inside her for the first time, and realised that the situation she was in was very real. The proud father: Kate's partner Aaron with their newborn son Mason . Mason was born at 6.5 pounds after a four hour labour, which Kate said was easier than she'd anticipated . Baby Mason lying on the stomach of his dad Aaron, a carpenter from Melbourne . When Kate arrived back in Australia, her mum took her for a further examination to find out details she wasn't given overseas. It was at this appointment that Kate was given even more shocking news. She wasn't 33 weeks pregnant, but 38 weeks, almost full term. 'I was scared because I didn’t know if the baby was healthy,' Kate said. 'I was also scared about the future. Being a mum is daunting. I had no money since I had just came back from overseas. Where will we live, how will we pay for stuff? I didn’t know all too much about babies.' Kate was told by the doctor that she had a tilted-back uterus, which explained why she didn't look like she was pregnant. She was still shocked that she had experienced no symptoms, and couldn't understand how it had happened to her. 'Any belly I had I thought was just a food baby from all the eating I’d done in Europe over two months.' 'I had thought about kids, and Aaron and I had spoken about it, but we we’re thinking it would be in a few years time… another 3-5 years time.' Kate said she and Aaron were reluctant to tell people about being pregnant, scared that they would be criticised for not picking up on the pregnancy sooner. 'I had thought about kids, and Aaron and I had spoken about it, but we we’re thinking it would be in a few years time… another 3-5 years time,' Kate said . 'When he came out it was surreal, and that skin on skin contact is exactly like everyone says. It's then that you realise that you've made this beautiful human being,' Kate said . However, Kate said that people were overwhelmingly supportive and excited, though everyone was shocked. 'I was scared to post on social media about him because I didn’t want to be judged,' she said. 'In the back of my mind I was scared of how people were going to react. I thought they'd be like, oh Kate, you were in Europe two seconds ago.' Kate said she was concerned people might think that she was trying to hide that she was pregnant. 'It was overwhelming trying to explain it to people, and I still haven't told the full story to everyone because it's such a long process. 'People just couldn't believe it, it's a pretty interesting story.' Kate's friends and family all pitched in and helped her and Aaron buy all the essentials, making sure they had all the material necessities to look after their baby- who they found out during a scan was a boy. 'That's when we started getting excited, ' she said. There was still one more surprise in store for Kate. When she had further testing the doctors gave her the news that she wasn't 38 weeks pregnant- Kate's baby was actually overdue and had to be induced immediately. Little Mason arrived after a relatively straightforward birth, weighing 6.5 pounds, which Kate said was easier than she had been expecting. 'He slipped out in the end,' she laughed. 'When he came out it was surreal, and that skin on skin contact is exactly like everyone says. It's then that you realise that you've made this beautiful human being.' 'Mason’s here and I’m going to try to be the best parent I can be for him,' Kate said . 'It's an amazing feeling knowing that you can create someone so perfect. We're definitely happy and wouldn't change it for the world, knowing what we do now,' Kate said . 'Aaron and I looked at each other, we were amazed. Even after two weeks we were still quite shocked and getting used to the fact were parents.' The 22-year-old went from being an independent young woman travelling the globe, to a first-time mum in only a week and a half, which she still finds hard to process. 'I'm so very lucky to have the support of my friends and family. It's been a huge adjustment to realise that I have a child, but Mason is such a good and calm baby.' Kate and her partner Aaron are now living with Kate's parents and have started thinking about what the future will hold for their family. 'Thinking about the future is scary,' said Kate. 'I need to figure out what's best. Should I work or go to back to university? We want to move out and need to be thinking about money.' Kate said that she is now having to consider things she never anticipated having to think about, even six months ago. 'At 22 you wouldn't think you’d be going off to buy a house, or thinking about what school districts are the best,' 'We've had to start thinking about what to expect in years to come instead of thinking in the short term.' The young mum said that she is learning to just roll with her new role and to make the most of her life with Mason. 'I have a beautiful healthy baby boy, my relationship with Aaron is stronger than ever, although it’s more work than it’s ever been, trying to find ‘us time’, so I can’t complain too much,' Kate told The Young Mummy. Mason is growing well, and is now rolling on his stomach and loves giggling, said Kate. 'I’ve just gotta’ roll with it and make the most of it.' It's been a long, but surprisingly quick journey to motherhood for Kate, who said that people are still shocked when she tells them the story. 'Even now when I tell people they are like ‘how?' For now, Kate said she is loving being a mother to her 'little miracle' Mason, and while she is still coming to terms with her new life, she is determined to be there for him no matter what. 'Mason’s here and I’m going to try to be the best parent I can be for him.' Kate said that she is so happy with the way her life has turned out, even though it was unexpected. 'It's an amazing feeling knowing that you can create someone so perfect. We're definitely happy and wouldn't change it for the world, knowing what we do now.'","Kate Hudson, 22, was on the trip of a lifetime to Europe with her girlfriends .

"The words of Jose Mourinho still echo: 'This is end of career.' I can only hope Martin Atkinson was listening. The focus is on the referee and rightly so. He’s paid a minimum of £85,000-a-year to watch games and make decisions. Some are difficult, referees will make mistakes, but Atkinson was guilty of not watching the game when Chelsea and Burnley fought out a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge. It’s as simple as that. Some say it’s more proof that we need technology – indeed that is Mourinho’s view. But why are we paying referees a healthy salary – three times the national average – if they can’t even see what is right in front of them? Jason Shackell’s foul on Diego Costa, the obvious handball in the box from Michael Kightly, Ashley Barnes kicking Branislav Ivanovic, and then Barnes' challenge on Nemanja Matic. If we bring in technology, I’m assuming referees’ pay will be dramatically reduced. Martin Atkinson was guilty of not watching the game in Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Burnley at Stamford Bridge . Atkinson will be paid at least £85,000-a-year to referee - why pay it if he cannot see what's in front of him? Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho speaking on Sky Sports' Goals on Sunday programme during the weekend . Atkinson’s failure could have had horrible consequences. A Burnley player,  Barnes, was allowed to get away with bending and nearly breaking a fellow professional’s leg. I don’t think Barnes is malicious, but I do think he is at best careless, and at worst reckless. But he is also a player who received a seven-match ban for deliberately tripping up a referee during a game he played for Brighton two years ago. The punishment has seemingly not registered as a deterrent. Some excessively physical challenges can be excused in the context of any given game, or the competitive spirit of the players. But Barnes on Matic was beyond any mitigation. This studs-up tackle from Ashley Barnes (centre) infuriated Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic . Some excessively physical challenges can be excused but Barnes on Matic was beyond any mitigation . The FA have hidden behind their own inadequate rulebook and so there will be no further action taken against Barnes. He is getting away with it for two reasons: firstly because the ref was so excruciatingly bad everybody is talking about him; secondly, Burnley are everyone’s favourite underdogs, and Sean Dyche is impossible to dislike. Barnes himself has done well as a professional footballer to lift himself up the leagues and make a mark in the Premier League, and I admire him for that. All of these reasons somehow come together to make it hard to criticise Burnley. Add to that the fact that your average football fan outside of Stamford Bridge dislikes Chelsea, and loves to see Jose Mourinho slip up, and it becomes easy to focus on the bad referee, rather than the naughty footballer. Sean Dyche is impossible to dislike and that is helping Barnes get away with his horror challenge . The average football fan is desperate for Mourinho to slip up and that also plays in Barnes' favour . If common sense were to be applied instead of the FA’s chopped logic, what would happen here? With his previous offence in mind, Barnes should be banned for the rest of the season. It would focus his mind in a way the previous ban didn’t. It would also send out a real message to professional footballers that they can’t get away with such challenges. They have a duty of care to fellow professionals. Atkinson should be put on gardening leave and his position reviewed in the summer. With his previous offence of tripping a referee in mind, Barnes (right) should be banned for the season . Atkinson should be put on gardening leave and have his position reviewed in the summer after this showing . Barnes (right) has done well  to lift himself up the leagues and that makes it hard to criticise Burnley . My instinct tells me Matic was rightly sent off. He was aggressive and then violent with Barnes. But when you look at the circumstances, I think there is definitely a case in this instance for the FA to rescind Matic’s red card but warn him about his future conduct. He is a player with no obvious history of violent conduct on the pitch, but he is a man who objects strongly when someone tries to break his leg. He didn’t swing a punch, he just bundled Barnes over. After failing to deal with Barnes in an appropriate manner, the Football Association can redeem themselves here. So do the right thing FA, and let Nemanja Matic play at Wembley on Sunday. Matic may have been violent but the FA should do the right thing at let him play in the Capital One Cup final .","Martin Atkinson made four big mistakes in Chelsea's draw with Burnley .

"Authorities may have recovered an Alabama woman's body over the weekend - more than one month after she disappeared. The body is that of Theresa Benn, the Talladega County Sheriff revealed to ABC 33/40 on Saturday -- though the affiliate station noted the Lincoln Police Department has not publicly identified the body. 'We had people on ATVs, on foot, and on boats,' Amanda Crowe with the Lincoln Police Department told ABC 33 40 of the multi-agency search for Benn. The last sighting of Benn, 42, took place at Speedway Industrial Drive October 19, the news outlet reported. Scroll down for video . Is it her? Though the Lincoln Police Department did not confirm the identity of a body found on Saturday, the Talladega County Sheriff has said the body is that of Theresa Benn, pictured . 'We're still asking for any information from the public,' Crowe also said. 'Anyone that might have saw something or have anything information that we don't already have to come forward.' The Lincoln Police Department said in a Saturday release 'On this date at approximately 1:00pm, searchers located the body of a white female in the Jackson Shoals area of Choccolocco Creek. Positive identification of the body will be determined by the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences pending their forensic investigation. The release continued 'The search was conducted and coordinated by Lincoln police in conjunction with Texas Equusearch in hopes of locating Theresa Benn, a local woman missing since October 19, 2014. 'Volunteers from Texas Equusearch, members of the community as well as off duty personnel from Lincoln Fire and Rescue, Etowah County Search and Rescue, Talladaga County Sheriff's Office, Talladega County DTF, and Calhoun County Sheriff's Office, took part in the search. The Lincoln Police Department would like to send a heartfelt thank you to all those who helped in the search.' Disappearance: The last sighting of Benn, 42 took place at Speedway Industrial Drive October 19, not far from the Talladega Superspeedway . Benn's family said in a November 17 statement to WIAT that 'Theresa’s husband, Kevin Dulaney, reported to police that he dropped Theresa off on the East end of Speedway Blvd near Mapco and Stuckey’s around 2 a.m. Sunday morning. Beyond this point in time, Theresa’s whereabouts are unknown.' It continued, 'Theresa was reported wearing a black tank top, blue jeans with a rhinestone covered belt and pink and brown cowboy boots. She was carrying her purse and cell phone. Theresa currently has long dyed blonde hair (natural brunette). She is 5’5” and 108 lbs.' According to the affiliate station, Dulaney had said to cops his wife exited the vehicle in the middle of an argument between the couple. Other searches via helicopter and in the water had not recovered Benn's body, Al.com reported earlier this month. Authorities told the website that Benn got out of Dulaney's car due to her desire to head toward Talladega Speedway. Crowe told Al.com at the time Dulaney had claimed Benn got out of the car around Easataboga Road, and that she had been heading toward Talladega Speedway.","Authorities may have recovered the body of Theresa Benn .

"A British people-smuggler picks up illegal migrants in Calais, hides them in his VW van and takes them to the UK and other countries - for free. Steve Pearson believes it's the moral thing to do - even though admitting to the illegal smuggling of migrants could get him arrested. 'I bring them in because the other alternative is them grabbing hold of the bottom of a lorry and they're going to come in anyway,' says Mr Pearson. A British man, Steve Pearson, told Channel 4 that he picks up illegal migrants in Calais, hides them in his VW van and takes them to the UK and other countries without charge . Mr Pearson was interviewed as part of Channel 4's Dispatches investigation into gangs of people smugglers in Calais, who are offering migrants a menu of prices to be transported to Britain - ranging from £700 'economy class' to £6,500 to secure a place in a lorry. The documentary discovered that the gangs tout for business at the camps referred to as the Jungle - which have sprung up near the French port town. More than 2,500 migrants from countries including Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan are camped there and are willing to risk their lives attempting to come to Britain. Mr Pearson says he simply wants to fight injustice - at least eight migrants have been killed in Calais this year after falling from moving vehicles and two more bound for the UK burnt to death last week in the back of a lorry in Dunkirk after an explosion. 'I understand that it's called a crime, but I don't feel as though it is by helping somebody. 'I'm trying to make a difference… I don't fear prison.' Investigation: Channel 4 reporter Paraic O'Brien meets an Eritrean woman in Calais during filming of Dispatches programme How To Break Into Britain . Reporter Paraic O'Brien, who uncovered these people-smuggling packages for Channel 4, reports that gangs lay claim to certain lorry parks at Calais where drivers park up overnight before boarding a ferry. While drivers sleep, gangs offer illegal immigrants access to their lorries - for a price. Shoaib Sharifi, an Afghan reporter working undercover, was offered access to a lorry park for £700, but was told he would have to board a lorry without help. He was also offered a £1,500 'business class' service by a Kurdish gang in nearby Dunkirk -  for that money they'd place him securely in a refrigerated lorry. 'They told me that there are two types of smugglers… each operating different lorry car parks,' explains Mr Sharifi. 'And one is known to be the best, i.e., controlling a better lorry car park with an easy access and charging more, and the other one, who's kind of seen as a second layer and slightly cheaper.' An image from the Channel 4 programme shows tents where migrants hoping to come to the UK live . There is no evidence that the lorry drivers themselves are involved in the illegal economy or business class travel packages. A 'first class' service is also offered to migrants, according to the documentary. Mr Sharifi was told by a middleman in Calais that for £6,500 a man of Afghan origin, who appeared to be operating from London, would provide a designated driver and van to smuggle him into Britain. This first class service differs from the other options in that the driver is aware that he will be smuggling someone in. 'The man [offering the service] was wary,' explains reporter Mr O'Brien. 'He didn't reveal his name or the location of his business in London.' For £1,500 this Kurdish smuggler, called Sadiquat, offered a 'business class' service - for that money they'd place him securely in a refrigerated lorry . These people-smugglers compete with each other, some even offering money back guarantees. Of course, most of the estimated 2,500 immigrants in Calais' makeshift camps can't afford to pay the smugglers and therefore can't access the lorry parks. As a result they are more likely to try to jump on moving lorries and get badly injured or in some cases killed – at least eight immigrants have been killed this year falling off of lorries. British lorry driver Colin Maplethorpe says the number of immigrants trying to board his lorry illegally is growing. 'It's changed a lot this last five or six years,' he says. 'There's a lot more of them. It's probably trebled to what it used to be.' With fines of £2000 per stowaway, however, it would be an expensive disaster for Colin if any immigrants were to hop aboard. Mr O'Brien says: 'The only winners here are the smugglers and the smugglers have blood on their hands.' Another smuggler called Tariq offered Channel 4's undercover reporter transport to get to Britain . Migrants break into a lorry as it fills up with fuel in a road close to the port of Calais in May . One Afghan migrant, who hopes to get a job in the UK after failing to find work in Italy, told the Sunday Times: 'There are 15 of us and if just two of us get through in three weeks, it's a good result.' He claimed that some of his friends have been attempting to cross the Channel for a month now. In response to the vast smuggling operations, local police have increased patrols in the area and Britain recently offered £12million to the French authorities to improve security at the port. French police stop a truck carrying Syrian migrants hoping to be smuggled into Britain earlier this year . Home Secretary Theresa May and her French counterpart Bernard Cazeneuve reached a deal which will also see increased co-operation between the two countries' law enforcement agencies. Some of the money will be used to construct robust fences and increase security in the parking area at the port. The National Crime Agency will also second a full-time officer to Ocriest, the French agency responsible for tackling illegal immigration, while the French border police will send two officers each month to work with the joint border intelligence unit in Folkestone. Last month a gang of eight Egyptians and a Tunisian were given jail terms by a court in Boulogne-sur-Mer after smuggling as many as 2,500 migrants into the UK from Calais during an eight-month period.","Steve Pearson hides them in his van because 'it's right thing to do'

"Motorists are being fined for leaving their diesel engines running, in a move aimed at cutting pollution. A council has begun issuing on-the-spot £20 penalties for drivers who fail to turn their engines off when they are stationary, leading to claims it is introducing a ‘stealth tax’. Others are likely to follow suit in order to meet European environmental targets. Scroll down for video . Motorists are being fined for leaving their diesel engines running, in a move aimed at cutting pollution . The draconian measures, in place in Islington, North London, are yet another blow to drivers with diesel cars. London mayor Boris Johnson has already revealed plans to charge them £10 extra to enter the centre of the capital from 2020. Communities minister Brandon Lewis called the fines a way to ‘tax drivers by stealth’ and warned that they could push people away from high streets. Councils gained the power to issue penalties for idling in 2002 but the rule has not been widely enforced until now. Officials from Islington Council in North London are to issue the on-the-spot fines, and will target buses, lorries and diesel cars . Officials from Islington council have claimed they will target lorries, buses and diesel cars. Mr Lewis told the Daily Telegraph the policy was symptomatic ‘of a clipboard-wielding culture in many town halls where every response to a policy challenge involves a new tax or a fine on local residents’. Islington councillor Claudia Webbe said: ‘We are committed to improving air quality, which is why we are clamping down on idling buses, lorries and diesel cars. ‘We need Boris Johnson to do his share by introducing a low-polluting bus fleet, and addressing the high number of polluting lorries that travel through our streets on a daily basis.’","Islington Council to issue fines if diesel drivers leave their engines running .

"Retail giant Big W has come under fire for selling novelty Christmas shirts with inappropriate slogans that activists claim sexualises young girls. A festive shirt with the slogan 'nice baubles' has targeted the attention of one outraged shopper, who has started a campaign to have the shirt removed after spotting it in a Big W store. Collective Shout spokesperson Coralie Alison spoken out against the sale of the shirts and said that the product could be harmful to young girls. A festive shirt with the slogan 'nice baubles' has targeted the attention of one outraged shopper, who has started a campaign to have the shirt removed after spotting it in a Big W store . 'These Tshirts can often have a double meaning and young girls can be innocently wearing them without realising the sexual connotation,' said Ms Alison. 'I expect more from a family department store like Big W. There should be checks and balances in place to ensure products that could be harmful to young girls are not ordered and approved for sale on the retail floor,' she said. Outraged shopper Rebecca Holloway created a Change.org petition to have the shirt removed, and said that for 'a supposed family store to sexualise Christmas is just so offensive,' 'There is so much over-sexualised material in marketing. What is this teaching our children, particularly our young girls? Women are sick of being objectified for our body parts,' Ms Holloway wrote on the petition description. Collective Shout spokesperson Coralie Alison spoken out against the sale of the shirts and said that the product could be harmful to young girls . Big W drew attention earlier in the year for introducing the controversial 'Scratch and Sniff' underwear range, which drew outrage from parents and shoppers alike . One supporter wrote, 'I am so tired of Big W using the sexualisation of women in its advertising and now this. I no longer even look through their sales magazines.' Another supporter pointed to what they saw as double standards, writing 'So what is Big W trying to say here, they will, without protest remove nativity scenes, because it MIGHT offend someone but happily sexualise Christmas, what an embarrassment.' Ms Alison said that 'street harassment and violence against women [is] such a big problem in our culture, and this Tshirt draws unnecessary attention to women and girl's chests and can encourage passers by to comment.' Big W drew attention earlier in the year for introducing the controversial 'Scratch and Sniff' underwear range, which drew outrage from parents and shoppers alike. The range, which was removed by the chain after a torrent of complaints were lodged, featured scratch 'panels' in the clothing which released a sweet scent when activated.

"A fierce hurricane which has left two people dead in the Caribbean and is expected to pass through Guantanamo Bay could hit the Florida coastline this evening. Hurricane Sandy hit land today just west of Santiago de Cuba in southern Cuba after roaring across the Caribbean, leaving two dead in Jamaica and Haiti. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said the storm hit Cuba with sustained winds of 114 mph. Scroll down for video . Fierce: A hurricane which has left two people dead in the Caribbean and is expected to pass through Guantanamo Bay could hit the Florida coastline this evening. Waves crash against this house in Jamaica . Life-threatening: Hurricane Sandy hit land today just west of Santiago de Cuba in southern Cuba. It has already roared across Jamaica and left two dead in the Caribbean. This picture was taken in Jamaica . Nasty: This satellite image shows Hurricane Sandy passing over Jamaica in the Caribbean. The storm is forecast to head north and possibly affect the U.S, particularly Florida . The Miami centre said that Sandy - which had strengthened to a category 2 hurricane - was located just inland over southeastern Cuba and moving north, northeast. It is expected to remain a hurricane as it moves through the Bahamas. The 18th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season was expected to pass to the west of the U.S. naval base at Cuba's Guantanamo Bay, where pretrial hearings were being held for a suspect in the deadly 2000 attack on the destroyer USS Cole off Yemen. The military warned the 5,500 people living on the U.S. base to be ready for the storm. Officials said there was no threat to the 166 prisoners - many of which are suspected terrorists. Despite no evacuation planned, sirens have been wailing across the base warning of the dangerous winds approaching. Some prisoners have also been moved from wood huts to steel and cement buildings. Strong: The U.S. National Hurricane Center said the storm hit Cuba with sustained winds of 114 mph. This woman wades through water in Jamaica . Worrying: After Cuba, Sandy is expected to pass over the Bahamas. It might bring tropical storm conditions along the southeastern Florida coast, the Upper Keys and Florida Bay.

According to The Miami Herald, forecasters say the worst of the . weather for South Florida will come this evening and tomorrow with gusts of wind up to 50mph, and heavy seas -  possibly . including 15-foot waves - which could cause strong erosion and thunderstorms. Cuba's Communist government, known for . its quick response to natural disasters, announced the evacuation of . about 450 tourists from beach resorts near Santiago, according to Cuban . state media. Civil defense Col. Miguel Angel Puig said Sandy 'is a complex of strong rains, very intense,' said  adding that the rains could affect 200,000 people in Cuba. The . U.S. hurricane center had said Sandy is expected to produce total . rainfall of 6 to 12 inches across Jamaica, Haiti, Dominican Republic and . eastern Cuba. 'These rains may produce . life-threatening flash floods and mud slides, especially in areas of . mountainous terrain,' the center said. Wet: Students are pictured walking in heavy rains in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic . Making the most of it: Locals are pictured in Santo Domingo riding through flood waters . People in Manzanillo, a city of 132,000 some 465 miles east of Havana, said they were worried about the impact, particularly after a wet summer that left sub-soils saturated. 'Given the condition of my house, I don't know if it will withstand the force of a hurricane, but we are prepared,' said Emiliano Lopez, a 62-year-old who lives near Manzanillo's seaside boulevard. In Santiago, Cuba's second largest city, tourist hotels prepared by getting generators ready and closing off some outdoor spaces and pools. Guests were being kept informed, but there were no evacuations other than from the beach resorts. Heavy rain was already falling late last night. Eye of the storm: This satellite image taken in the early hours of this morning shows the hurricane moving northward over eastern Cuba with sustained winds of 110 mph . Concerns: Jamaican authorities closed the island's international airports and police ordered 48-hour curfews in major towns to keep people off the streets and deter looting . 'We're well prepared for the storm,' said Mayte Cuesta, an employee of the Hotel Melia Santiago. 'It will affect us, but we don't think there is any danger.' As Sandy crossed over Jamaica yesterday an elderly man was killed by a boulder that crashed into his clapboard house, police said. In southwestern Haiti, a woman died in the town of Camp Perrin after she was swept away by a river she was trying to cross, said Marie Alta Jean-Baptiste, head of the country's civil protection office. Drenched: These residents of Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic brave out the storm . Jamaican authorities closed the island's international airports and police ordered 48-hour curfews in major towns to keep people off the streets and deter looting. Cruise ships changed their itineraries to avoid the storm, which made landfall Wednesday afternoon near the capital, Kingston. In some southern towns on Jamaica, several crocodiles were caught in rushing floodwaters that carried them out of their homes in mangrove thickets. One big croc took up temporary residence in a family's front yard in the city of Portmore. Stranded business travelers and a smattering of locals rode out the hurricane in hotels clustered along a strip in Kingston's financial district. Some read prayer books or novels, while others watched movies or communicated with loved ones on computers. Warnings: Hurricane Sandy is expected to pass to the west of the U.S. naval base at Cuba's Guantanamo Bay which holds a number of terrorist suspects . Precautions: Some prisoners at Guantanamo Bay  have been moved from wood huts to steel and cement buildings . Cris Hopkinson, a Toronto woman who was on a business trip, said she hoped to catch a flight off the island Friday once the stormy weather cleared. 'For now, I'm just hoping that the glass in the windows doesn't shatter from the winds,' Hopkinson said in the dining room of the Courtleigh Hotel. About a mile away in the neighborhood of Grants Pen, where shops have been ransacked in the past during storms, a number of young men ignored the curfew, riding on bicycles or walking in small groups in the steady rain. Cecile Graham, a mother of two teenagers, said she was worried about the possibility of burglaries or looting at the small markets and shops that line the main road. 'I hope that all the police are out and we won't have the looting that has taken place before,' she said. Far out in the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Tony posed no threat to land. The storm had maximum sustained winds of about 50 mph and was moving east-northeast at 25 mph. Its center was 1,060 miles west-southwest of the Azores.","The category 2 hurricane hit southern Cuba today after roaring across the .

"The number of people living with HIV in the UK has reached a record high. The Health Protection Agency (HPA) said there were now about 100,000 people who have the virus, an all-time high. But health officials have warned a quarter of people who have the human immunodeficiency virus are not aware they have been infected. The number of people living with HIV in the UK has reached a record high . There were 6,280 people diagnosed with HIV in 2011, the HPA said. Nearly half of all diagnoses in 2011 were acquired heterosexually. Of these, more than half were probably acquired in the UK, compared to only 27 per cent in 2002 according to the HPA report. New diagnoses among gay men has also reached an all-time high in 2011, with 3,010 men discovering they were infected. The HPA said that one in 20 men who have sex with men in the UK now have HIV, the figure soars to nearly one in 12 in London. Black African people are also at a higher risk, the HPA said, with 37 per 1,000 living with the infection - overall HIV prevalence in the UK was 1.5 per 1,000 people. Dr Valerie Delpech, HPA head of HIV surveillance, said: 'These figures are a reminder of how vital safe sex programmes remain. 'Promoting HIV testing and condom use is crucial to tackling the high rates of transmission, late diagnosis and undiagnosed HIV still seen in the UK. 'National HIV Testing Week is a great opportunity to encourage people to get tested. 'We also encourage clinicians to take every opportunity to offer the test to those in higher risk groups and, in high prevalence areas, to all general medical admission and new GP registrants. 'The good news is that with the excellent services and treatments available nowadays, if diagnosed and treated early someone with HIV can look forward to a normal lifespan, as well as protecting their sexual partners from infection. At risk groups include gay and bisexual men and African communities . 'That's why it is vitally important that anyone who has been at risk gets an HIV test, and that those in higher risk groups get screened regularly.' At risk groups include gay and bisexual men and African communities. The Terrence Higgins Trust said regular testing can halt the spread of HIV. IThe trust said in the UK, gay and bisexual men and African communities remain the groups most affected by HIV, but more than a quarter of those with HIV in these groups are undiagnosed and therefore at risk of serious health problems. Sir Nick Partridge, chief executive of the charity, said: 'HIV is an entirely preventable condition, yet each year we see thousands more people across the UK receive this life-changing diagnosis. 'While there is still no cure and no vaccine, that doesn't mean we need to accept its continuing march. 'Reducing undiagnosed HIV by encouraging those in high-risk groups to test more regularly is one way we can put the brakes on the spread of infection. 'A simple HIV test, offered free at clinics and testing services all over the country, might add over 40 years to the life of someone with HIV, diagnosed in good time. 'Knowing your status also helps you protect your partners in the future. 'Thirty years on from the start of the epidemic, public understanding of HIV has dropped to a worrying level. 'As a result, we are starting to see a significant increase in the number of heterosexuals acquiring the virus in the UK. 'It is important that everyone, no matter their age or background, understands that nobody is immune from infection. 'We all have a responsibility to get our understanding of the virus up to a basic level, and know how to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe.' 6,280 people were diagnosed with HIV in 2011, a 1 per cent decrease on the previous year. Nearly half (47 per cent) of those people were diagnosed late, after a point at which they should have started treatment. 500 people with HIV died in 2011. 48 per cent of new diagnoses in 2011 were among heterosexuals, and 52 per cent of those infections were acquired in the UK. 73,660 people in the UK accessed HIV care in 2011, an increase of 6 per cent on 2010 and more than a threefold increase since 2000. Professor Jane Anderson, chair of the British HIV Association, added:'Many people are simply not being signposted to take an HIV test. 'With a general lack of routine HIV testing being commissioned for general medical admissions and in the general practice setting this is not altogether surprising. 'We need a greater emphasis on HIV testing and on all aspects of prevention. 'With successful treatment, a person with HIV in the UK can expect a near-normal lifespan. 'But for that to happen, early diagnosis is vital. 'Too many people only get tested when their HIV infection is already at an advanced stage, compromising both their own health and that of their partners.' HIV attacks the immune system and weakens the ability to fight infections and disease. Aids is the final stage of HIV infection, when the body can no longer fight life-threatening infections. HIV is found in the body fluids of an infected person, and about 95% of people are infected through sexual contact. Deborah Jack, chief executive of the National Aids Trust, said: 'What is striking about the HPA's data is how it really shows both our successes and our shortcomings in tackling HIV in the UK. 'On the one hand, we can hail treatment as a real success story. Treatment is effective, people diagnosed with HIV can access it easily, and it is working in keeping the virus under control. 'However, when it comes to increasing the uptake of testing - the gateway to treatment - our services are patchy, inconsistent and ultimately we are still failing to make any significant headway in tackling the high rates of undiagnosed HIV.'

"School lunch will remain on the menu and you can expect the mail to arrive - just don't plan any weekend trips to museums or state parks. A new report today has taken a look at how services would or would not be . affected if Congress fails to reach an agreement averting a government . shutdown at midnight on Monday. President Obama and the leader of the . Democratic-controlled Senate dismissed a late developing plan approved . early on Sunday by the GOP-run House that would delay by a year a key . part of the new health care law and repeal a tax on medical devices, in . exchange for avoiding a shutdown. A government shutdown would have far-reaching consequences for some, but minimal impact on others: . AIR TRAVEL . Federal air traffic controllers would remain on the job and airport-screening staff would keep funneling passengers through security checkpoints. Federal inspectors would continue enforcing safety rules. Shutdown: The tourist trips to Alcatraz would stop running if the federal shutdown goes ahead on Monday . INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL . The . State Department would continue processing foreign applications for . visas and U.S. applications for passports, since fees are collected to . finance those services. Embassies and consulates overseas would continue . to provide services to American citizens. BENEFIT PAYMENTS . Social Security and Medicare benefits would keep coming, but there could be delays in processing new disability applications. Unemployment benefits would still go out. FEDERAL COURTS . Federal courts would continue operating normally for about 10 business days after the start of a shutdown, roughly until the middle of October. If the shutdown continues, the judiciary would have to begin furloughs of employees whose work is not considered essential. But cases would continue to be heard. MAIL . Deliveries would continue as usual because the U.S. Postal Service receives no tax dollars for day-to-day operations. It relies on income from stamps and other postal fees to keep running. Lunch is served: School students who qualify for free school lunches and breakfast will not go hungry even if the shutdown goes ahead this week . RECREATION . All national parks would be closed, as would the Smithsonian museums, including the National Zoo in Washington. Visitors using overnight campgrounds or other park facilities would be given 48 hours to make alternate arrangements and leave the park. Among the visitor centers that would be closed: the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island in New York, Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Alcatraz Island near San Francisco and the Washington Monument. HEALTH . New patients would not be accepted into clinical research at the National Institutes of Health, but current patients would continue to receive care. Medical research at the NIH would be disrupted and some studies would be delayed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would be severely limited in spotting or investigating disease outbreaks, from flu to that mysterious MERS virus from the Middle East. FOOD SAFETY . The Food and Drug Administration would handle high-risk recalls suspend most routine safety inspections. Federal meat inspections would be expected to proceed as usual. HEAD START . A small number of Head Start programs, about 20 out of 1,600 nationally, would feel the impact right away. The federal Administration for Children and Families says grants expiring about Oct. 1 would not be renewed. Over time more programs would be affected. Several of the Head Start programs that would immediately feel the pinch are in Florida. It's unclear if they would continue serving children. Safety first: Airport-screening staff will remain at work during the shutdown with safety being a top priority . FOOD ASSISTANCE . The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, could shut down. The program provides supplemental food, health care referrals and nutrition education for pregnant women, mothers and their children. School lunches and breakfasts would continue to be served, and food stamps, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, would continue to be distributed. But several smaller feeding programs would not have the money to operate. TAXES . Americans would still have to pay their taxes and file federal tax returns, but the Internal Revenue Service says it would suspend all audits. Got questions? Sorry, the IRS says taxpayer services, including toll-free help lines, would be shut as well. LOANS . Many low-to-moderate incomes borrowers and first-time homebuyers seeking government-backed mortgages could face delays during the shutdown. The Federal Housing Administration, which guarantees about 30 percent of home mortgages, wouldn't underwrite or approve any new loans during the shutdown. Action on government-backed loans to small businesses would be suspended. SCIENCE . NASA will continue to keep workers at Mission Control in Houston and elsewhere to support the International Space station, where two Americans and four others are deployed. The National Weather Service would keep forecasting weather and issuing warnings and the National Hurricane Center would continue to track storms. The scientific work of the U.S. Geological Survey would be halted. HOMELAND SECURITY . The majority of the Department of Homeland Security's employees are expected to stay on the job, including uniformed agents and officers at the country's borders and ports of entry, members of the Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration officers, Secret Service personnel and other law enforcement agents and officers. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services employees would continue to process green card applications. MILITARY . The military's 1.4 million active duty personnel would stay on duty, but their paychecks would be delayed. About half of the Defense Department's civilian employees would be furloughed. PRISONS . All 116 federal prisons would remain open, and criminal litigation would proceed. VETERANS SERVICES . Most services offered through the Department of Veterans Affairs will continue because lawmakers approve money one year in advance for the VA's health programs. Veterans would still be able to visit hospitals for inpatient care, get mental health counseling at vet centers or get prescriptions filled at VA health clinics. Operators would still staff the crisis hotline and claims workers would still process payments to cover disability and pension benefits. But those veterans appealing the denial of disability benefits to the Board of Veterans Appeals will have to wait longer for a decision because the board would not issue any decisions during a shutdown. WORK SAFETY . Federal occupational safety and health inspectors would stop workplace inspections except in cases of imminent danger. Cultural abyss: The National Museum of Natural History at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. would be one of many to close during a shutdown . Lawmakers spoke past one another on the . Sunday talk shows, often rehashing the turbulent fights about the health . overhaul that the Supreme Court has upheld, as the nation edged toward . the first government shutdown in 17 years.

"The Office of Naval Research is pulling back the curtain on 'automated swarm' technology that would give artificial intelligence the helm on 'deter, damage or destroy' missions to protect personnel. The Arlington-based Office of Naval Research debuted the technology in August with demonstrations involving unmanned patrol boats that could autonomously defend and attack targets. The exercise demonstrated the escort of a high-value Navy vessel to simulate threats in an environment like the Persian Gulf. Unmanned: The technology should be rolled out to fleet commanders within a year and also has civilian applications . Up ahead, a manned helicopter crew spots a Navy vessel in the role of a possible enemy boat set to encroach on the ship's path. Using sensor technology, a group patrol boats then break off in an attacking formation to engage the unidentified intruder, while the remaining assets stay behind to protect the ship. In one exercise, the patrol boats encircle the unidentified ship and blare warnings from loudspeakers, which eventually drives the target vessel away. If that option hadn't dissuaded the other ship, the boats had .50 caliber machine guns and directed-energy weapons that could remotely fire, though planners say the finger on the trigger is human. Robert Brizzolara, program manager at the Office of Naval Research, said that the artificial intelligence in the software decides for itself what movements the boat swarm makes. Once a threat is detected, the boats work together and encircle or block the path of an opposing vessel, detecting both the enemy vessel and other nearby vessels' movements. Advanced algorithms help the boat plan its route and determine its course of action and speed. The 'automated swarm' technology Navy's fleet within a year, according to defense officials. The Arlington-based Office of Naval Research demonstrated the autonomous swarm boat technology over two weeks in August on the James River near Fort Eustis in Virginia . The new technology could one day help stop attacks such as the deadly bombing of the USS Cole off Yemen in 2000 when a small boat packed with explosives killed 17 sailors and injured 39 on the warship . Personnel safety and cost reduction are both driving the development of artificial intelligence-equipped vessels. According to Rear Adm Matthew Klunder, chief of naval research, self-guided force protection systems would have stopped the terrorist attack on the destroy USS Cole in 2000. In the attack, suicide bombers piloted a dinghy with explosives molded to the hull and exploded it near the Cole, killing 17 sailors and injuring dozens more. In the intervening years, the Navy overhauled how it protected high-value ships, enforcing perimeters and adding defense specialists, but self-guided boats would put personnel out of harms way. Self-guided unmanned patrol boats that can leave warships they're protecting and swarm and attack potential threats on the water are set to join the Navy's fleet within a year, according to defense officials. The rigid-hull inflatable patrol boats can also fire .50 caliber machine guns, but a human will always be the one to make the decision to use lethal force, officials said . 'I never want to see the USS Cole happen again,' said Klunder, 'I can tell you the systems we just put out on the water would've prevented the Cole.' The transportable kit that allows a boat to use swarm capabilities costs about $2,000 and can be applied to existing patrol boats and other small vessels in use at Navy bases and aboard warships. Defense One reports researchers and political experts are raising ethical and legal concerns to giving military assets artificial intelligence. 'Growing autonomy in weapons poses a grave threat to humanitarian and human rights law, as well as international peace and security,' says Matthew Bolton, Dyson College political science professor. Whereas a soldier can fall back on human discretion in the modern battlefield, 'Death by algorithm represents a violation of a person’s inherent right to life, dignity and due process.' A similar debate happened over landmines in previous generations, according to Bolton. 'When the vast majority of countries outlawed anti-personnel landmines,' he says. 'They established that weapons which maim or kill absent of direct human control are morally reprehensible.' Other researchers say problems will lie with poorly designed systems, not solely its use on the battlefield. 'It will be critical to ensure that these systems behave in alignment with our ethical principles,' says computer scientist Steven Omohundro, who has argued for rethinking how we develop artificial intelligence. 'The security of these systems is also of critical importance because hackers, criminals, or enemies who take control of autonomous attack systems could wreak enormous havoc.' In 2009, hackers breached electronic defenses of 'two or three' security contractors working on the F-35, according to the Wall Street Journal, which included Northropp Grumman, BAE Systems and Lockheed Martin. Officials on the project said a number of fail safes were in place that would shut down the systems if contact between boats and operators were broken. Klunder says that the technology was originally developed by NASA for the Mars Rover spaceflight programs, but August's demonstration showed numerous boats could coordinate with each other. 'This is something that you might find not only just on our naval vessels, we could certainly see this utilized to protect merchant vessels, to protect ports and harbors, used also to protect offshore oil rigs,' Klunder said.","Self-guided unmanned patrol boats showed off the ability to leave the warships they're protecting to swarm and attack potential threats .
The rigid-hull inflatable patrol boats were armed with .50 caliber machine guns, giving the human operator a lethal force option .
Technology could help prevent incidents such as the 2000 attack on the USS Cole off Yemen in which 17 sailors were killed .

Smoking breaks was voted the fifth most popular way in which employees wasted time at work according to their bosses . Behaviors of co-workers, meetings and other factors are also creating obstacles to maximizing performance. ‘While many managers feel their teams perform at a desirable level, they also warn that little distractions can add up to bigger gaps in productivity,’ said CareerBuilder’s Rosemary Haefner. ‘It's important to be organized and designate times to work on different deliverables. Minimize interruptions and save personal communications for your lunch hour or break.

"A leading professor has called on Australian policy makers to shorten the full time working week to 35 hours so parents have more time to spend with their young children. Dr Lyn Craig, who works as a researcher at the University of NSW, has spent the last decade looking at the patterns of people's lifestyles in Australia. She has now released new research detailing the amount of time mums and dads spend working, looking after young children and carrying out household chores in comparison to those in the US, Denmark, France and Germany. Scroll down for video . Mums and dads in Australia notch up more hours in paid and unpaid work . They also spend more time on childcare and doing household chores . Dr Craig told Daily Mail Australia that the current situation is 'unsustainable' and the government needs to shorten the number of full-time hours parents work because stress levels are 'extraordinary'. Dr Craig's research found that Australian mums and dads with young children under the age of four had a paid and unpaid heavier workload, she told Daily Mail Australia. Australian fathers with young children spent 10.51 hours a day on paid and unpaid work, reports the Sydney Morning Herald, in comparison with French fathers who had the easiest workload at an average of 8.5 hours a day. Dr Craig told Daily Mail Australia: 'Parents in Australia work long hours but the gender gap is quite extreme. New research compared data with the US, Denmark, France and Germany . Professor Lyn Craig calls the current situation 'unsustainable' 'Men do a high number of paid hours and they do a lot more than French and Danish men. With that women are doing so much more paid and unpaid work. 'Australian fathers also do a lot of childcare, but if we want men to do more in the home then the workforce hours need to go down.' The research shows Australian men are equal highest with Danish men on how much time they use to look after their young children. Dr Craig said she was also worried about how stretched households are becoming. She added: 'Paid and unpaid work are necessary to making society work. 'Childcare costs are going up and parents are spending more hours than ever with their children, the kids need more attention and spending more hours with your children is becoming more normal. 'Childcare needs to be more accessible and a subsided system would be sufficient. 'Mums and dads have to run out to get their children and there is anxiety of the deadlines if they are late and that stress is extraordinary, the current system is unsustainable.'","Mums and dads in Australia notch up more hours in paid and unpaid work .

"This is the best that London's skyline has to offer - in 16 outstanding panoramic photographs of the capital as you've never seen it before. Graham Charlie Edwards took the spectacular pictures from a mixture of public spots and private flats, from the City to Primrose Hill, for a new book. It features what could be the best view from any London home - the one enjoyed by Jeffrey Archer, from his Albert Embankment penthouse.

"A Canadian couple have released a video of the completely inadequate wedding officiator who not only ruined their ceremony, but it was also unauthorized to marry them. Jessica and Casey O'Donnell, from Peterborough, Canada, were married in August in Kijiji and hired an officiator named George T. Casselman online to oversee their ceremony and legally confirm their nuptials. Mr O'Donnell said he delivered a 'trainwreck' at the altar and the video makes for excruciating viewing. A Canadian couple have released a video of the completely inadequate wedding officiator who not only ruined their ceremony, but it was also unauthorized to marry them . Jessica and Casey O'Donnell, from Peterborough, Canada, were married in August in Kijiji . They hired an officiator named George T. Casselman online to oversee their ceremony and legally confirm their nuptials . Casselman misplaces the rings, and then drops them, before asking where they are as the crowd laughs. He also forgets his place in his book as he repeats lines, but insists it was because someone had 'messed' with his book. He even mispronounces words and adds his own spin on traditional phrases. At one point he loses his place in his notes, prompting the confused bride to mutter, 'Couldn't you just make it up?' When he finally gets to the end of the ceremony he announces: 'Ladies and gentlemen, I give you great honour and great joy and privilege to announce to you, Mr. and Mrs. Jessica O'Donnell. The exasperated groom is then seen shrugging his shoulders - 'I'm taking her name,' he says . The 27-year-old bride describes the whole experience as 'mortifying.' 'He just dropped the ball completely,' M O'Donnell told The Star. 'It seemed like (it took) an eternity.' The couple got engaged in February and in April they found Casselman's post 'The Wedding Officiant,' online. They paid him a $75 deposit on a total fee of $250 but the couple said when they suggested a dress rehearsal, Casselman told them it was unnecessary. He also forgets his place in his book as he repeats lines to the bemused couple . He even mispronounces words and adds his own spin on words . Casselman misplaces the rings, and then drops them as the couple become more perturbed by his behaviour . Following his conduct at the wedding, they were so incensed that they tried to contact him and he finally responded three days later with a text message in which he explained he should have done a rehearsal. He also refers to 'my heart diabetes,' claiming he had a 'mild heart attack' after the ceremony, and that he is 'truly sorry about that day.' The couple refused to pay Casselman his entire fee after the ceremony, and demanded their deposit back which they did not receive. But this week they got a further shock when they received a call from Service Ontario telling them Casselman was not authorized to marry people in the province. The exasperated bride turns to look at her bridesmaids as the series of gaffes continue . Casselman asks the couple where the rings are - after already dropping them . The O'Donnells say they now have to go to family court and apply for an 'order of validity' to finally make their marriage official, an ordeal Casey expects to cost 'about $500.' Cynthia Vukets, spokesperson for Service Ontario, declined to speak specifically about the Casselman-O'Donnell case, but she told The Star couples such as the O'Donnells are still considered legally married, but they must apply to the courts to 'determine that the marriage is valid' before the province can recognize the union. It is a crime in Ontario, to knowingly 'solemnize' a marriage without the authority to do so. Casselman told Mr O'Donnell via text message this week that he was certified by the 'United National Church of Canada' - the website states it will 'ordain' people to perform marriages for $139.99. But the organization is not authorized to certify marriage officiants in Ontario, Vukets said. Casselman did not return The Star's request for comment - and the United National Church was unavailable for comment.

"A major increase in free childcare will be unveiled today as the Government steps up its efforts to intervene earlier in children’s lives. Chancellor George Osborne will use his mini-Budget to double the number of two-year-olds receiving free nursery care, with an additional £380million a year in funding by 2014-15. The Coalition promised universal nursery education for three and four-year-olds last year. Parent-friendly policies: Chancellor George Osborne doubled free childcare for two-year-olds with an additional £380m in his mini-budget . It also made a pledge to extend this to the most disadvantaged two-year-olds. A Government source said: ‘We’re aiming to close the gaps between young children that are opening up even before they hang up their coats for their first day at school. ‘Currently six out of ten two-year-olds from the poorest families do not experience any formal early education – the participation rate in the wealthiest homes is 72 per cent.’ Other measures expected today include: . Mr Osborne is also expected today to unveil a big squeeze on working tax credits, Gordon Brown’s favoured method of channelling cash to less wealthy families. Critical observers would say that toddlers should not be in need of any formal nursery provision or childcare and should be in the care of their mothers. However, ministers believe that the reality of modern living means many  mothers cannot afford not to work. Pre-school: The coalition promised universal nursery education for three and four-year-olds last year and is keen to intervene early in children's lives . Iain Duncan Smith, the government’s leading champion of early intervention, argues that the state must intervene earlier to provide parenting support for failing families at the bottom end of society. The Chancellor also wants to wean families off means tested benefits and concentrate resources on children’s earliest years. A source said: ‘This is part of the Government’s approach to child poverty and social mobility, aiming to fundamentally change the prospects of children by focusing on early years service provision as a better way to improve life chances than means tested transfers. ‘This goes further and offers more help to hard-working families to help boost life chances.’ Parenting support: Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary . Totalling £650million over the next three years, the targeted extra funding will double the number of two-year olds covered to 260,000 – around 40 per cent. Compared with this year, 130,000 more will have access to 15 hours of free education and care a week – up from just 20,000 in 2010. Earlier this year, Mr Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, led calls for earlier state intervention in children’s lives to provide parenting support. He said: ‘A child’s life development score at just 22 months can serve as an accurate predictor of educational outcomes at 26 years’. He also pointed to research which showed that parental interest in their children’s education could increase their chances of moving out of poverty as an adult by 25 percentage points. He added: ‘Shamefully, this is a story that has hardly changed in the last decade.’ In another move, the Chancellor will dramatically bring forward the year when the state pension age will climb again to 67. Whitehall sources said an announcement would come as early as next week. Under Labour’s timetable, the pension age was set to reach 67 between 2034 and 2036. But ministers say Britain’s ageing population and spiralling pension costs mean that is untenable.","Universal nursery education for two, three and four- year-olds .

"When Vicky Perry’s beloved pet cat went missing, she was prepared to go to any lengths to find her. Which was just as well... because the mission to rescue Martina involved a transcontinental social media campaign, a 2,000-mile return journey over land and sea and an emotional reunion in a French bar. The saga began when Miss Perry, 27, decided to return to the Wakefield in the UK after four years of living in Sicily, Italy. Vicky Perry, 27, decided to return to the Wakefield in the UK after four years of living in Sicily, Italy - but . The primary school teacher wanted to bring her pet with her – but feared the journey by ferry, plane and coach would be too much for Martina, who she had nursed back to health after adopting her as a nervous and neglected stray. Then a friend recommended a UK-based company, Shiply.com, which matches people with transport providers for shipments of all kinds and could bring Martina home more comfortably. Miss Perry found positive reviews on the site for driver Robert Roph, and accepted his quote of £700 to transport Martina from Palermo to the UK in an air-conditioned Toyota van. She said: ‘At the time I thought it would cause the least hassle, ironically.’ After launching a Facebook campaign Miss Perry received this photo (left) from a man named Francois who found Martine in a Nice Bar - she then travelled back from Wakefield to France to pick up her pet . The driver paid to transport Martina the cat (pictured) claimed he lost her after she bit him and escaped . However, things began to go wrong when German-born Roph did not arrive on the agreed morning. He eventually turned up at 2am ‘with excuse after excuse, including that he’d had a flat tyre along the way’. Miss Perry added: ‘His “state of the art” van was a car that he was clearly living in, there was rubbish all over the back seat and Martina in her basket had to go in the boot. 'But what was I supposed to do? I had no other options.’ Reluctantly, Miss Perry waved off her pet and continued to the UK. But when Roph failed to answer her increasingly frantic calls and emails, she rang Shiply.com, which sent the driver an email threatening to terminate his account. His response horrified her: ‘There is a problem with the cat delivery from Palermo … When I was cleaning the cage, the cat bit me and escaped … I been three days surching [sic] in Nice and could not find it again … I give up, as nobody there saw it.’ After finding out her beloved pet was missing, Miss Perry wasted no time in  spreading the word on social media – including posting pleas for help on the Facebook pages of every bar and restaurant in Nice (pictured) Miss Perry, who had already handed over £250 to Roph, said: ‘I couldn’t process that he’d actually lost my cat three days ago and I was only finding out now. 'I was so angry at myself for trusting him.’ She wasted no time in registering Martina’s disappearance on English, Italian and French microchip databases and spreading the word on social media – including posting pleas for help on the Facebook pages of every bar and restaurant in Nice. And then, ten long days after she had last set eyes on her pet, Miss Perry received a Facebook message saying a cat fitting Martina’s description was being looked after in a bar in Nice. Convinced by the grainy photograph, she leapt into action, getting a ferry from Dover to Calais and then hiring a car for the 12-hour drive to Nice – and paying the bar £40 to stay open for an extra hour until she got there. She said: ‘When I saw Martina I was so happy I didn’t know what to do with myself. 'As soon as she heard my voice she started miaowing – which the manager said she hadn’t done the whole time.’ Shiply.com has refunded Miss Perry’s £100 handling fee, and she will now undertake legal proceedings against Roph to try to recover the money she paid him. A relieved Miss Perry added: ‘Next time I go travelling with Martina it will have to be for a very good reason.’ When she received the photo of Martina Miss Perry caught a ferry from Dover to Calais and then hired a car for the 12-hour drive to Nice – and even paid the bar £40 to stay open for an extra hour until she got there .","Vicky Perry, 27, decided to return to the UK from Italy with her cat Martina .

Speaking of the altercation, she said: 'At 11 o’clock I was in the car valeting bay with a colleague and we were cleaning a car. 'The radio was playing and the presenter said they were going to the news and a two-minute silence would follow. 'But my colleague kept working despite me asking her to stop. 'I turned off the power washer she was using and then she turned it on again. Then I turned it back off again.

'We regard the changes as vital to securing the long-term health of the organisation but I acknowledge that is no comfort to those who will lose their positions,' Mr Scott told ABC staff on Monday . The Abbott government has slashed $254 million from the ABC's budget over the next five years. 'We regard the changes as vital to securing the long-term health of the organisation but I acknowledge that is no comfort to those who will lose their positions,' Mr Scott said. 400 jobs to go . State-based 7.30 programs axed . Five regional radio stations shut . Local sport coverage to go . Switchboards to be 'centralised' Adelaide production to cease . Non-news studios closing . Lateline moved to ABC24 . Changes to Radio National . Bush Telegraph will end . Fewer ABC Classical concerts . Lanceley Place premises to be sold . Despite the recent petition launched by Education Minister Christopher Pyne, Adelaide's TV production will be shut down. 'The economics of the television sector make it difficult to maintain small-scale operations. It is more economically efficient to base production, outside news and current affairs, in Sydney and Melbourne,' Mr Scott told staff. Local sport coverage has been cut with a focus on national events. 'With the ABC facing declining audience interest in local sport competitions and some codes chasing commercial opportunities, ABC Television is revising its sports strategy to ensure the most cost-efficient use of resources and optimal audience impact,' Mr Scott added. Lateline will be moved from its current slot on ABC1 to ABC24. Other non-news studios will be closed, as well as several switchboards around the country. There'll be less concerts recorded for play on ABC Classical FM. The Lateline program will be moved from ABC1 to a fixed time slot on ABC24, the broadcaster's news channel . Five regional radio stations will also be lost in Wagin, Morwell, Gladstone, Port Augusta and Nowra. The ABC has also axed rural radio program Bush Telegraph. The show, which aired on Radio National, provides an in-depth look at rural and regional stories across Australia. It's believed four jobs will go with the program's demise. Foreign bureaus will be restructured 'to create multi-platform hubs' but there will be a post opened in Beirut. Among the other proposals is the sale of its Lanceley Place site in Sydney and a review of other premises in the broadcaster's property portfolio . Mr Scott has also proposed programming and staff changes to ABC Local and Radio National, as well as those announced for ABC Classic FM. Among the other proposals is the sale of its Lanceley Place site in Sydney and a review of other premises in the broadcaster's property portfolio. Staff were told at a meeting and via video by ABC managing director Mark Scott from the broadcaster's Ultimo headquarters in Sydney. He told them that 'in charting this new course, my thoughts go out firstly to those who face losing their jobs. As other companies in the media sector have found, structural change can have painful personal consequences'. 'We anticipate that more than 400 people, close to 10 per cent of our ongoing workforce, face redundancy as we adjust our activities,' he said. 'We regard the changes as vital to securing the long-term health of the organisation but I acknowledge that is no comfort to those who may lose their positions.' Thousands of protesters held rallies against the cuts in Sydney and Melbourne at the weekend. SBS has also been asked to find $53 million in savings over the same period.","The ABC says more than 400 people will be made redundant in coming months amid deep budget cuts .

"The BBC has spied on the email accounts of its staff 140 times in the past five years, MailOnline can reveal today. Staff in an internal unit known as the BBC Investigations Service have snooped on employees’ accounts to probe alleged criminal activity including assault, fraud, theft, bribery and harassment. Requests for monitoring email accounts since 2009 have also been authorised for the investigation of computer misuse, information leaks, malicious communications and security incidents. Spying: Staff in the BBC Investigations Service have snooped on email accounts to probe alleged criminal activity including fraud, theft, bribery and harassment. BBC Television Centre in West London is pictured . The BBC said probes ‘generally involve members of BBC staff, our service partners or third parties whose activity adversely impacts on the BBC, whether this occurs on BBC premises or elsewhere’. There have been 21 requests authorised in 2013 so far - which, if it fails to increase by more than two, is the lowest level in five years - below 30 in 2012, 40 in 2011, 24 in 2010 and 25 in 2009. The staff being monitored would have been unaware that their emails were being read, although the Corporation insisted employees are aware that monitoring can occur in ‘exceptional circumstances’. The figures for 2012 were released in a Freedom of Information Act (FOI) request earlier this year, which revealed four monitoring requests were made for an apparent leak of information. It also showed that there were eight requests regarding computer misuse, six for fraud, one for harassment, one for bribery, two for malicious communication, two for theft and one police enquiry. Graphically shown: There have been 21 requests authorised in 2013 so far - which, if it fails to increase by more than two, is the lowest level in five years - below 30 in 2012, 40 in 2011, 24 in 2010 and 25 in 2009 . The data for 2013 and the three years prior to 2012 was released to MailOnline following another FOI request that was responded to in 32 working days - 12 days over the legislation’s 20-day limit. 'Monitoring of email accounts is invariably undertaken in relation to criminal or disciplinary investigations and staff are aware that monitoring can occur' BBC spokesman . Although the Corporation could not provide the breakdown for reasons behind requests, it said that the 40 in 2011 included complaints, security incidents, information leaks and even assault. Requests in 2009 and 2010 were for the likes of computer misuse, fraud and more information leaks. A BBC spokesman said: 'The BBC rarely monitors staff email accounts and only in exceptional circumstances where it is reasonable, necessary and represents a proportionate response.’ ‘Monitoring of email accounts is invariably undertaken in relation to criminal or disciplinary investigations and staff are aware that monitoring can occur.'","BBC Investigations Service staff have snooped on employees' accounts .

"Symbolic salute: The mystery veteran who stood on an overpass in Lehi, Ohio, has revealed himself as former Army helicopter pilot Jonathan Walker . When a soldier stood on an overpass on Veteran's Day, motorists were left baffled. Then as he saluted, drivers in Lehi, Utah, started to honk their horns in support while some even got out of their cars to shake his hand. Now the anonymous serviceman has identified himself as former Army helicopter pilot Jonathan Walker. The 43-year-old, who served in the military from 1992 to 2000, hoped his symbolic gesture will inspire others to do something similar, and set up the website Standing Quietly in a bid to encourage future events. In just 24 hours, it got more than 800 hits and an overwhelming number of civilians writing to him with their heart-wrenching tales of war, loss and patriotism. 'I had no idea what a reaction my small action would get,' the married father-of-three told MailOnline. 'I have felt for years that our Veterans need more support. It has been a gradual feeling but this year I felt it needed to be addressed. 'Veterans belong to us, the people. If they are deployed for whatever reason, it's on us to support them and give them a proper homecoming. 'You can build hospitals and make donations, but there is nothing like somebody standing up for you or shaking your hand. That is a different kind of healing.' Walker was a member of the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment - 'I still treasure my Cavalry Stetson hat' - and saw vast swathes of his friends deployed to war zones, some more than four times. However, with few large military bases in Utah, he says many civilians appear to feel disconnected from Veterans Day. It is something he hopes to change. 'If veterans are not made to feel proud of what they did, it's a hard psychological barrier to get over. 'I'd like to close off the bridge for three hours on the morning of Veterans Day every year and get as many vets as possible standing up there with me. 'I've already had about 45 vets say they will be there next year, there were even people with no connection to the military that want to join.' A number of people made their way onto the bridge to shake Walker's hand in gratitude. And alongside a flurry of support for next year's event, Walker has also received dozens of emotional emails from veterans and veterans' families. Gaining attention: Walker, who served in the military for seven-and-a-half years has set up the website Standing Quietly in a bid to plan events and stunts in the future . Staying strong: Walker has also posted other pictures of veterans performing similar gestures and hopes more will do the same in the future . One woman described how her father was driven to alcohol after returning to a hostile nation following the Vietnam War. 'So many of them experienced the demons; the demons that are difficult to escape without support.' Writing on Standing Quietly, Walker said: 'I am trying to stay true to the original reason I walked onto that overpass. I want to bring attention to Veterans. 'I think through this we can help Veterans. I am making this site to try to further that goal. Here we can unite and plan future events for Veterans Day 2015.'","Jonathan Walker stood on an overpass in Lehi, Utah, for an hour .

"Former first lady of France Valerie Trierweiler has branded the country's politics 'misogynistic' and said female politicians encounter opposition as 'a matter of course'. Ms Trierweiler, the ex-partner of French president Francois Hollande,  has written a tell-all book chronicling her seven years as his girlfriend - which ended when it was reported he was having an affair with actress Julie Gayet. It is believed the book, Thank You For This Moment, could damage Mr Hollande's reputation with controversial claims he called the country's poor 'the toothless'. Scroll down for video . Valerie Trierweiler (pictured left) the ex-partner of French president Francois Hollande (right) has written a tell-all book about her time as his girlfriend in which she claims he called France's poor 'the toothless' Ms Trierweiler also claims in the book that Mr Hollande instructed for her to be given high doses of tranquillisers shortly after they had broken in order to keep her in hospital and out of his way. In an interview with Kirsty Wark on the BBC's Newsnight, which will be broadcast tomorrow, Ms Trierweiler was asked: 'Is France misogynist?' She said: 'In the realm of politics, yes. Women in politics encounter opposition as a matter of course.' Ms Trierweiler told Sophie Raworth on BBC's Andrew Marr Show today that the book was not the revenge of a hurt woman. She said: 'It's not revenge, it's not about destroying him, it's about me rebuilding myself.' She was then asked if she was saying that she did not think he was suitable as a president. She said: 'You know what political figures are like. They don't become president if they're not self-centred, or if they're not sometimes economic with the truth. 'I've followed other presidents in my professional career, I've only known one intimately, but the majority of them have these faults, in that they're completely egocentric. 'I don't think Francois Hollande has more faults than another president.' Francois Hollande and Valerie Trierweiler pictured when they were together celebrating his election victory . Ms Raworth suggested that Ms Trierweiler had made an 'awful lot of money' out of the book. Ms Trierweiler replied: 'Yes, well, I will next year, but that wasn't my primary objective. 'The media said, ""don't read this book, don't buy this book"", but people did anyway, because they wanted to know. 'And the majority of people say to me, ""It's not at all what I was expecting, it's not a settling of scores, it's not a book of revenge, it's almost a love story"". That's what my book is.' When she was asked why she had written the book, Ms Trierweiler, a journalist, said: 'In fact I started writing it before knowing that it was going to become a book. 'For me writing is a form of therapy, I started writing it when I wasn't feeling terribly well and that was a good reason for writing it.' She said the title 'will remain a mystery, a message that only Francois Hollande himself will understand'. She added: 'It's not a personal attack on Hollande at all, it is the story of our relationship, there are good moments and bad moments I describe in it.' When asked about the tranquillisers, she said: 'I only know that he told me to take the medicines the next day and they were a higher dose than usual.' Ms Trierweiler told Sophie Raworth on the Andrew Marr Show the book was not the revenge of a hurt woman . In the Newsnight interview Ms Wark said: 'You called him king of the double speak with ambiguity and perpetual lies. So what kind of man was that?' Ms Trierweiler said: 'Unfortunately, these are the characteristics of lots of politicians. These are the mysteries of love. I was in love with him.' Asked if he really called the poor 'the toothless', she said 'of course'. She added: 'This book wasn't aimed at destroying him; its aim was to help me rebuild my own life. 'I've also said in the book that he is exceptional at times, abroad he comes across very well for instance. 'I think the book will be an electric shock for him.' When she was asked if she was among the 65 per cent of French people who believe Mr Hollande should quit - according to a poll in Le Figaro - she said: 'No. Absolutely not. 'We must respect democracy, he was elected for a five-year term, he has two-and-a-half more years to prove himself. 'It's something he can do and believe he can be re-elected.' The Newsnight interview will be broadcast tomorrow at 10.30pm.","Ex-partner of French president has written book about their relationship .

"Supermarkets are selling fish which is two weeks old and labelling it as ‘fresh’, an investigation has found. Fish on sale at the fresh counters of Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons was found to be up to 15 days old. Experts said some samples of cod, plaice, mackerel and haddock were ‘bland’ with ‘little flavour’, and that they could start to taste ‘off’ after just a day in the fridge. Scroll down for video . Current guidelines say fish can be sold as fresh if it has been kept on ice since being caught . Fish scientist Richard Chivers examined and tasted 14 pieces of fish including samples from Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda, Morrisons and an independent fishmonger. He found that a third of the fish – including some from Morrisons, Asda and Sainsbury’s – was between 12 and 15 days old. Mr Chivers said: ‘Customers naturally assume that fresh fish in their local supermarket is caught yesterday, if not in the past few days. ‘They think the fish is going to be fresh and tasty. But some of the samples we tested they are not going to enjoy at all.’ He used the Torry scale – an industry standard system to measure freshness – in which experts rate the fish’s physical characteristics to estimate how long ago it was caught. Mr Chivers found some fish was in danger of going off quickly. ‘These are not off, but give them a day in a domestic fridge and you would begin to taste an off odour,’ he told the Sunday Mirror. Current guidelines say fish can be sold as fresh if it has been kept on ice since being caught. Morrisons’ fisheries manager, Huw Thomas, said: ‘Careful planning ensures that the time between the fish being caught and then sold on our counters is minimal . In our experience, the Torry scale is a reliable tool for judging quality, but not food safety or how long each fish has been out of the water.’ A Tesco spokesman said: ‘We ensure all our fish is of good quality.’ Asda also defended the freshness of its products, saying: ‘We are the only retailer to publish how and where we source our wild fish.’ A Sainsbury’s spokesman said all its fish would remain ‘good quality for the duration of its shelf life’.","Experts tested fresh counters of Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons .

"Backlash: Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls is said to have boasted that he played a key role in a doomed takeover deal that drove the Co-op Bank to the brink . Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls faces a backlash from thousands of savers after it emerged he boasted of playing a key role in a doomed takeover deal that drove the Co-op Bank to the brink. Last night he was also facing questions over donations made to Labour by the Co-op in the year the fateful merger with Britannia Building Society was sealed. During a speech in 2010, Mr Balls told how he helped grease the wheels of the 2009 deal. He claimed it would create the ‘first ever super-mutual’ providing a better deal for customers ‘rather than the banking elite’. In reality, the merger was sowing the seeds of disaster for the Co-op Bank, which is now launching a raid on its own investors to plug a £1.5billion black hole in its finances. Mr Balls claimed that as Economic Secretary under Gordon Brown he secured the Treasury’s backing for a new Private Member’s Bill that allowed the takeover to be pushed through. The Butterfill Bill was passed in 2007 and lifted a ban on mutuals and co-operatives from merging. At that time regulators were concerned about the quality of the loans on Britannia’s books. Last night Mr Balls also faced accusations of ‘conflict’ of interest as it emerged that Labour received £750,000 in donations from the  Co-op Group in 2009 – the same year the merger was sealed. Most of this was channelled to Labour’s sister party, the Co-op Party, which supports 32 MPs. Mr Balls is a Co-operative and Labour MP and his office received £50,000 from the group last year. The usually outspoken Shadow Chancellor has refused to criticise the Co-operative Group over its rescue plans, which involve slashing the incomes of at least 7,000 investors –  many of them pensioners. In the 2010 speech, entitled ‘A Co-operative mini manifesto’, Mr Balls described his ‘co-op vision of people working together for the benefit of the whole community’. He also said he was ‘proud’ to be the first Co-op MP to stand to be a Labour leader. Ill-fated: The merger was sowing the seeds of disaster for the Co-op Bank, which is now launching a raid on its own investors to plug a £1.5billion black hole in its finances . Mark Taber, a private investor who is leading a campaign on behalf of thousands of investors to block the plans, said: ‘Balls has been strangely quiet but has some serious questions to answer. ‘He has been left with egg on his face and must now break his silence.’ Last year the Co-op Group donated £800,000 to fund Labour and Co-operative Party candidates. Labour has also received £34million in cheap loans from the Co-op over the past twenty years. The Co-op’s rescue plan involves freezing the income of thousands of investors in generous bonds. Some were being paid as much as 13 per cent in annual interest – or £1,300 for a £10,000 investment. In exchange for their bonds, investors will be offered either a cash pay off, shares in the new bank, or new bonds. But they face losing 35p for each £1 of Co-op bonds they hold. A spokesman for Mr Balls said: ‘Ed has long been a champion of the important role that not-for-profit mutuals can play in providing financial services. ‘When he was a minister he supported this Private Member’s Bill, which enabled co-operatives and building societies to merge for the first time without demutualising.’ The spokesman added the merger decision was ‘a commercial decision for the Co-op Bank’.","Mr Balls was facing questions over donations by Co-op to Labour .

"Health chiefs are planning to close a Burger King that is located inside a hospital after years of complaints the fast-food restaurant does not live up to health standards. The branch in Southampton General Hospital will be closed next year after attracting criticism from politicians and health organisations. Hospital chiefs say it is no longer in keeping with the 'healthcare environment' bosses wish to portray, and will not renew the fast food restaurant's lease when it expires in 2016. A hospital in Southampton has decided to close the Burger King restaurant in its lobby following complaints from healthcare organisations and politicians that it did not live up to health standards . The fast food giant has had an outlet in the hospital for almost 20 years. 'The trust is currently in the process of redeveloping its main entrance retail area,' a spokesman for Southampton General Hospital said. 'This is to ensure it is more reflective of the healthcare environment in which it is situated. 'The Burger King franchise currently occupies a retail space that is leased until 2016, but there are no plans to extend the contract beyond that point,' a spokesman for the hospital said. Dr Hilary Jones supported the decision, saying: 'Let’s tackle obesity and let’s start by ensuring hospitals are healthy places. The fast food restaurant in Southampton General Hospital was found not to reflect a healthcare environment . A typical meal at the fast food outlet which has been inside the hospital for more than 20 years . A poster encouraging patients and visitors to give the restaurant feedback hangs next to ward directions . The hospital will not extend Burger King's long-held lease in the facility when it is up for renewal in 2016 . 'You would not get a doctor telling patients to stop off for a burger and a can of Coke. 'If you are being told to eat healthy and exercise by overweight doctors and nurses it is hypocrisy so we should be setting a better example.' MP Rob Flello, chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on obesity, said: 'I think fast food outlets like Burger King have their place, but being in a hospital is not an appropriate. 'This is welcome news and I hope other hospitals take the time to review the outlets that they have.' Burger King have declined to comment. Earlier this year it emerged that a hospital in Dundee was selling an 800-calorie, 'heart attack' pie in its canteen. Critics described the delicacy as 'a heart attack on a plate'. Ninewells Hospital admitted selling the pies at one of its takeaway restaurants, but insisted there were also healthy options on the menu. The 'heart attack pie' being sold at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee contains an astonishing 800 calories .","The fast food restaurant at Southampton General Hospital will be closed .

"It was billed as 'the most amazing Christmas experience that planet Earth has ever seen', complete with a baby reindeer hut, hundreds of Christmas trees and a festive express train to take children to visit Santa. But a festive winter wonderland created by interior designer Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen has shut after just one day after dozens of children were left in tears because of rude staff, Santas Little Helpers stood around smoking and broken rides. Parents said the Magical Journey at the Belfry Golf Club in Wishaw, Warwickshire, has ruined the build up to Christmas for their children, as they attacked the 'tacky' attraction which costs up to £22.50 for a ticket. Scroll down for video . The Magical Journey in Warwickshire closed on Sunday after just one day following complaints by parents about long queues, rude staff and cheap toys at the attraction, created by Laurence Llewlyn-Bowen . The ride was closed on Sunday as organisers said they needed to make improvements to the experience . Organisers confirmed they had closed the site for three days until Wednesday so they 'could implement changes and improvements to the experience.' But unhappy families have demanded their money back after bombarding the company with complaints. Parents complained about rude staff, large queues for their children to visit Father Christmas and said cheap unwrapped presents, some squashed or broken, were being handed out to their children. Others complained of a lack of festive decorations and Christmas music, despite paying more than £20 a ticket for their children. Natalie Craig wrote on Facebook: 'I want my £22 refunded. 'You did not deliver what you advertised and have ripped people off that is the issue and some of your staff are damn right rude and clearly do not care. 'Magical experience what a joke and it didn't even last the allocated time of 80/90 Minutes either.' Alex Turner added: 'Never mind the 'rain', the rude & unhelpful staff, unsafe train, rubbish cheap present that's given unwrapped, workmen sat around smoking, empty tepees, rooms not being soundproofed, no music or festive decorations, waiting around in a succession of empty rooms, and lack of a baby reindeer are frankly enough for me to digest!!' Elizabeth Yeomans said: 'Ruining the magic of Christmas for little kids! 'Ripping off parents right on top of Christmas when they could've spent that money on Christmas presents! Well done!! I hope Laurence whatever his name is, and The Belfry, are proud!!' Parents reported that the winter express train, to Santa's grotto, broke down during the first day it was open . Organisers said the Magical Journey would be closed for three days and heavy rain had affected preparations . The Magical Journey remained closed today following complaints about smoking elves and poor decorations . Mr Llewlyn-Bowen unveiled the winter wonderland last week and had promised it would be a unique festive experience for families. He said a visit to Father Christmas would 'never be the same again' and that the experience was 'going to be perfect.' Tickets were sold up for the weekend and seven days in the run-up to Christmas and organisers had been working through the night last week to get the attraction ready for the launch day after preparations were hampered by heavy rain. However many have criticised both Llewlyn-Bowen and organisers behind Magical Journey for false advertising and poor health and safety. Mother-of-three Melanie Brzonkalik, 46, was one of the first to visit the attraction at 10am on Saturday. She paid £140 for tickets and travelling up from Gloucester, a three hour round trip, with her three children Noah, five, Tegan, 13, and Sam, 15. The teaching assistant said she knew straight away the visit was going to be a 'nightmare' after spotting elves hanging around outside smoking and complaining about their shifts. She said the Christmas illusion was then completely shattered when they saw a 'very skinny Santa.' She said: 'You could see right through to the back where there was boxes of fake snow and diggers and elves standing around having a fag. 'It shatters the magic somewhat straight away when you see elves standing around smoking and moaning that they were working until 9pm. 'My 15-year-old son just looked at me to say 'where on earth have you brought me to? 'As you went in there was a few Christmas trees but without any decorations or lights or music - it was depressing. 'Then we walked through a door that looked like any old arena or hall. There was no Christmas feel to it whatsoever, the stalls were poor and the museum was appalling. 'They had a few antlers, a sledge and then a babygrow with fur around which was supposed to be Santa's when he was a baby. It was laughable. 'Our Santa was OK but there was this really skinny Santa there too, which people weren't too happy about at all. Especially when the presents weren't even wrapped. 'We went because we respect and like Llewelyn-Bowen and his personality but we were bitterly disappointed. 'It just didn't seem finished, it will take more than three days to get that all sorted, that's for sure.' Anthony Kingscott said: 'I visited the magical journey today at 10.30am the whole experience was a joke, budget is not the word to explain this place. 'While we tock (sic) the 15 second train journey the train hit a tractor parked in the car park then one of the trees if they would of hit the tractor any harder the train would of turned over the train was being driven wrecklessly and too fast for the conditions. Parents claimed long queues and broken down rides at the attraction had ruined their children's Christmas . Mr Llewlyn-Bowen opened the experience last week and said the festive attraction was going to be 'perfect' The festive experience was billed as 'the most amazing' Christmas attraction ever seen before it opened . 'I will be contacting health and safety to report this first thing Monday morning, the main tent construction had screws and sharp objects sticking out, there has been no thought of safety at this event at all.' Organisers said torrential rain over the last few days had affected lighting and sound at the site and also saw a large build up on mud. On the Facebook site for Magical Journey, organisers posted: 'Based on customer feedback we have taken the decision to take three full days closure today (23/11/14), tomorrow (24/11/14) and Tuesday (25/11/14) in order that we can implement changes and improvements to the experience. 'Our customers are our priority for safety and a magical experience and we sincerely apologise for any inconvenience this may cause. 'It is important that we deliver the high quality experience you are expecting and hope to reopen with improvements and changes having been made' 'We have also had difficulty with torrential rain on site affecting effecting the lighting and sound, we have people working to repair this damage.' Customers affected by the closures have been offered refunds or the chance to rebook the experience. Speaking at the launch, Mr Llewlyn-Bowen said: 'It is a brave thing to be doing this sort of thing completely outside. Normally it is in an industrial unit so these things can be completely controlled. 'There is no magic in that. Yes, we have had some teething troubles. But by Saturday it is going to be absolutely perfect. 'We set ourselves a very high bar. We wanted to push the envelope. We have been very lucky with the location with the Belfry. 'We have a sensational section of woodland that we can use for the grand finale.' On the company's website the Magical Journey is described as 'a never before seen and magnificent immersive theatrical version' of Santa's Grotto. It also promises to be a spectacular experience 'with Laurence's flair for the dramatic.' The experience promised a Big Top with an indoor market as well as seasonal food and drink. And for children the site advertised an elf display and a ride on 'Father Christmas' Express Train' through snowy woodland. Tickets cost between £10 and £15 for adults, and £17.50 and £22.50 for children, depending on what day of the week customers visit. A weekend trip would cost a family of four with two children £75. The wonderland, which is due to run to Christmas Eve, was launched by Mr Llewlyn-Bowen on Thursday. It features 700 Christmas trees and 140 elf workers. Mr Llewlyn-Bowen has been contacted for comment.","The Magical Journey opened in Wishaw in Warwickshire on Saturday .
Was designed by Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen and promised to be 'the most amazing experience ever seen' for children during the run-up to Christmas .
But it closed after just one day following dozens of complaints by parents .
They said queues to see Santa were too long and the 'magic train' broken .
Complaints included no Christmas decorations and elves seen smoking .

"A former British wartime spy will this week be recognised for her part in liberating France from Nazi occupation - 70  years after she was parachuted behind enemy lines. Phyllis Latour Doyle spent years gathering information on German positions and risked her life to send 135 coded messages back to Britain before the country's 1944 liberation. For decades, the 93-year-old kept her heroic actions secret  - only telling her four children about her wartime service 15 years ago. Brave: Phyllis Latour Doyle spent months gathering information on German positions and risked her life to send a total of 135 coded messages back to Britain before France's 1944 liberation . Speaking in a rare interview five years ago, she said: 'My eldest son found out by reading something on the internet, and my children insisted I send off for my medals. She told New Zealand Army News: 'I was asked if I wanted them to be formally presented to me, and I said no, I didn't, it was my family who wanted them.' But Mrs Doyle, who now lives quietly in New Zealand, will be publicly recognised for her service when she receives the Legion of Honour, France's highest decoration, on Tuesday. It will be presented but the French ambassador to New Zealand as part of the commemorations for the 70th anniversary of the battle of Normandy. Posting on Facebook, her son, Barry Doyle, who is understood to be attending the event, said that he is 'very proud'. Reluctant: Mrs Doyle said that she spent years hiding her wartime actions and only told her children about her vital role in the liberation 15 years ago. They encouraged her to request her medals, pictured above . The daughter of an English mother and a French doctor, Mrs Doyle joined the Women Auxillary Air Force in 1941 to train as a flight mechanic. While there, impressed secret service recruiters with her tenacity, spirit and fluency in French and was chosen to train in espionage. She became one of 40 female agents working for the Special Operations Executive (SEO). Speaking to Army News in 2009, Mrs Doyle said that she joined the SEO 'for revenge'. She explained that her godmother committed suicide after being taken prisoner by the Nazis and that her father was shot by the Germans. Spy: While living in France in 1944, Mrs Doyle was known by the codename Paulette . Intensive training was crammed into a few months. As well as gruelling physical tests - including lessons in scaling buildings and wriggling across muddy fields - recruits were taught by a prolific cat burglar. Mrs Doyle told the New Zealand Army News: 'We learnt how to get in a high window, and down drain pipes, how to climb over roofs without being caught.' Then in her early 20s, she was required to memorise Morse code and be able to tap 24 words a minute - professional telegraphists only needed half that speed. Agents were taught to encrypt messages, repair broken wireless sets and practised sending messages from remote locations. She was first deployed to put her extensive training into action in August 1942. For the next year, Mrs Doyle, using the codename Genevieve, was based in Aquitaine along with Claude and Lise de Baissac, the organisers of the underground SCIENTIST network. On May 2 1944, the young woman, then 23, parachuted out of a United States Air Force bomber over Nazi-occupied Normandy - ready once again to put months of specialist training into action. Now identified by the codename Paulette, she assumed the identity of a poor teenage French girl to make the Germans less suspicious. Aware that agents only had a 50 per cent chance of survival, she made sure to move around often - sleeping rough and staying with allied sympathisers. The intelligence she sent back to London was fed into the huge Allied command machine, and used to guide bombing missions to enemy targets. After the war, Mrs Doyle moved to Kenya and Fiji before settling in Australia. She now lives quietly in a suburb of Auckland. The French Ambassador to New Zealand, Laurent Contini, who is presenting the Legion of Honor to Mrs Doyle, said she was a 'formidable example for younger and older generations alike.' He said: 'I have deep admiration for her bravery and her unshakable commitment to ending the war and it will be with great honour that I present her with the award.'","Phyllis Latour Doyle was born to an English mother and French father .

"One of the ring leaders of a child grooming gang in Rotherham has boasted he is 'living the high life' after being released from jail. Umar Razaq, 28, was jailed in 2010 in a case that lifted the lid on the horrific extent of sexual exploitation in the South Yorkshire town. But after appealing the length of his four-year sentence, he has been released - and is now jetting off on holiday to Pakistan. Scroll down for video . Jetting off: Umar Razaq, 28, only served a year for grooming in Rotherham and is now free to go on holiday . Bragging: He posted this status on Facebook, leaving his victim Lizzie feeling tormented . His victim Lizzie, who was only 12 when she was groomed by Umar Razaq, has been left distraught by the posts, saying he 'taunted' her on the social networking site after being released from jail. Posting a selfie in sunglasses on Facebook, Razaq boasted: 'Can't wait... Roll on to the lifetime holiday'. 'Three days and I'm outta this country for a very long time. Feeling happy,' he added. The sickening Facebook posts come in the wake of a damning report that revealed at least 1,400 girls were subjected to sexual abuse and grooming at the hands of Asian gangs in Rotherham for 16 years. There are now 173 live investigations into grooming in the town, while council officers face calls to acknowledge the 'systemic failures' of their leadership by stepping down. Razaq, who served less than a year despite the depravity of his crimes, allegedly stalked Lizzie earlier this summer by 'following' her boyfriend on Facebook. Lizzie, not her real name, was raped by four other men after Razaq groomed her. She claims she told police and Rotherham Council about his activities on the internet but they 'weren't bothered'. She said: 'I told South Yorkshire Police what he was doing and how scared I was but no one seemed to care. The police knew exactly what was going on months ago but none of them were bothered.' Last night South Yorkshire Police said they unable to comment on Lizzie's allegations. Talking of the effect of Razaq's stalking, she said tearfully: 'It was like he was taunting me, saying he could see what I was doing and was watching me. 'He shouldn't be allowed out in the first place and what he has been posting about his own life is disgusting. Victim: Lizzie, a victim of the Rotherham scandal, was groomed from the age of 12 . Happier times: On holiday with her parents, aged 12 . 'Taunts': Razaq, who served less than a year despite the depravity of his crimes, was yesterday boasting of 'living the high life' while on a 'holiday of a lifetime' 'I feel frightened that he can see me and could find me so easily. It all takes me back to what happened.' She claimed Razaq had been following her boyfriend, Jack, on Facebook without them realising. This meant he was able to watch what Jack was posting on his profile page. Then, earlier this Summer, he added Jack as a friend – which is when she looked at his profile and she realised 'the awful truth'. She said: 'I was freaked out, I saw the profile and asked Jack if he knew him and he said no. He could see everything we were doing, all the soppy things we were saying and all the things that are private.' Razaq was jailed in November 2010 for four-and-a-half years but had his sentenced reduced to three- and-a-half. The 28-year-old was released in July 2011 having served just nine months, after his time in remand was taken into account. On Facebook yesterday, he boasted that he was 'living the high life' after leaving the country on Tuesday to go on a 'holiday of a lifetime'. In July he posted a story about a 'woman crying rape' and wrote: 'All women are the same.' Jack said: 'It's almost as if he is proud of what he has done.' Lizzie, who is now 19, said: 'These men should not be allowed on the streets. When I was told Umar was out in July 2011 by Victim Support I couldn't believe it. He had been in less than a year.' Lizzie was 12 and living with her grandmother in Rotherham when she first came across Razaq in January 2008. He was 22 – ten years her senior – but plied her with cigarettes and alcohol, and she eventually started to meet him in the town centre. She said: 'Umar used to tell me he loved me and had feelings about me. 'He treated me like a princess and said my family did not love me and didn't want me. He got my trust then did horrible things to me.' Razaq also introduced her to his older brother Razwan and his cousin Zafran Ramzan – who both groomed her for sex. After a few months, when she had turned 13, Razaq tried to force her to have sex with him, trying to tear her clothes off. He pulled her hair and called her a 'white bitch'. On another occasion Razaq rang his cousin and told him to come and have sex with the girl while he looked on. She said: 'I was only a little girl when I was raped for the first time. Five men sexually abused me, in alleyways, parks, on playing fields and even in cars.' All five of her abusers were jailed in November 2010. Zafran Ramzan was jailed for nine years for raping a 16-year-old girl and two counts of sexual activity with a child. The other four, Razwan Razaq, Mohsin Khan, Adil Hussain and Razaq, were convicted of sexual activity with a child. Revealed: Officers' callous treatment of sex gang victim . Ready for lessons in her school uniform, and hugging her parents on a family holiday, Katie's childhood photos are like any other young girl's. The pictures give no sign of the horrors that awaited her when she met her abuser. At 14, she fell for the man ten years her senior who groomed her into a violent relationship and separated her from her family. Katie's childhood photos are like any other young girl's, but they show no sign of the horrors that awaited her when she met her abuser . Yet council workers and police acted as if she was to blame for getting involved with the convicted criminal, she claimed. She said one officer, attending an incident where her abuser had threatened to kill her, even told her: 'Well, what did you expect?' Katie – not her real name – was attacked several times by the man, who had served two jail terms, but said police did nothing to help her and saw the assaults as just 'a bit of domestic violence'. Her desperate parents had her put into care, hoping it would end the relationship, but she said carers openly allowed him to continue visiting. Yesterday she called on South Yorkshire PCC Shaun Wright, responsible for Rotherham children's services, from 2005 to 2010, to resign. Katie, now 29, said: 'He should be ashamed of himself. The more he holds on to his job, the harder it will be for victims to move forward.' She said it was 'disgraceful' her abuser was still walking free and that council and police staff had held on to their jobs, adding: 'I was emotional when I first saw [the report] on the news, but now I am in anger mode – I want justice to be done. 'When I was 14 and 15 I thought I was in love with him, but when I was 16 I made a statement because there's only so much you can take. The police took a statement and to my knowledge he has never even been questioned. He should have been punished.' Katie's abuser was allegedly reported to police by a council organisation for victims of child sex offences in 2001, after it heard from 18 girls who described him as their 'boyfriend'. Yesterday, South Yorkshire Police did not respond to requests to confirm whether they had taken any action against the man.'","Umar Razaq bragged on Facebook after only serving a year for his crimes .

"Foreign investors are a big part of the Australian property market, with their passion to buy down under, especially the Chinese, continuing to grow. But there's been a major push for foreign investors to be exposed to more stringent dealings when snatching up properties. A change.org petition, calling for tougher rules on foreign ownership of Australian property, has now reached more than 29,000, a jump of more than 20,000 in the last month. Foreign investors are growing in Australia, the Chinese making up a big part of that . A change.org petition is hoping to enforce tougher rules for foreign investment on Australian properties . Simon Hocking who launched the petition argues it is hard for Australian's to purchase properties overseas so why can't we implement the same sort of rules. 'I would not be able to buy property in China, Sri Lanka with 100% tax on foreign freehold purchases, Thailand and Singapore generally prohibited with strict limitations, Indonesia prohibited and many emerging economies requiring citizenship,' he said. 'I am not suggesting no foreign investment, but a more thorough testing of foreign buyers and purchases and a toughening of regulations by the Foreign Investment Review Board.' The FIRB current foreign investor rules state that they need to notify the government and get prior approval to acquire interest in certain types of real estate. 'Interest' has been defined as buying real estate, obtaining or agreeing to enter into a lease or license or financing or profit sharing arrangements. It also states that regardless of value, foreign persons generally need to notify the Government and get prior approval to take an interest in residential real estate, vacant land or to buy shares or units in Australian urban land corporations or trusts. The FIRB current foreign investor rules state that they need to notify the government and get prior approval to acquire interest in certain types of real estate . 'We predict Chinese property investment will increase in Australia by 15 to 20 per cent over the next 12 months,' Simon Henry, co-CEO of Juwai.com told Domain . In the FIRB annual report for 2012/2013 it was found that the real estate sector recorded 12,025 foreign investment approvals, compared with 10,118 approvals in 2011‑12. It was determined as the most popular sector for foreign investment with approvals in 2012‑13 of $51.9 billion. A parliamentary inquiry into foreign investment was investigating concerns raised that foreign investment in Australian real estate is causing a distortion in the market and making housing less accessible and affordable.’ Leading the inquiry, Kelly O’Dwyer said ‘this inquiry is not focused on investors from any particular country into Australia’s real estate market'. 'The committee will take a very broad and holistic approach to examining whether the current policy settings in this regard are delivering the best possible outcomes for Australia.’ The Foreign Investment review board's annual report for 2012/2013 found that the real estate sector recorded 12,025 foreign investment approvals, compared with 10,118 approvals in 2011‑12 . The Sydney Morning Herald reports it has been suggested that the FIRB has not prosecuted a single case since 2006, though the FIRB has said there were 33 ongoing investigations. Simon Henry, the co-CEO of Juwai.com, a Chinese property website, predicted interest by foreign investors has increased. 'We predict Chinese property investment will increase in Australia by 15 to 20 per cent over the next 12 months,' Mr Henry,  told Domain. 'The average price of a property a Chinese person is buying in Australia is around US$1.36 million,' he said. Mr Hocking said 'the FIRB and Treasury connections are formidable adversaries. Pressure needs to mount on lax Executive Members and a 'political culture' which could be described as against the national interest.'","change.org petition has more than 29,000 who support tougher rules for foreign investors buying Australian real estate .

"An anonymous note left on a woman's front door asking her to not wear a bikini while gardening because she is 'fat' has sparked outrage. The yellow post-it note was left at the entrance to a  woman's house, and said 'I don't appreciate fat people wearing bikinis/short shorts when watering. Please cover up or I will report you.' The note went on to say, 'You disgust me. I didn't move here for this. Also, cover up when walking your cat.' The unidentified woman from Bundaberg in Queensland told NewsMail that the note completely shocked her, and left her feeling as though she wasn't free to be herself in her own home. Social media users have slammed the note as 'cowardly', 'rude', 'tactless', and 'sick'. 'Whoever wrote that note and left it on the lady's front door is nothing but scum, why didn't she confront the lady instead of the note , because whoever did it is gutless and cruel,' said one commenter. '(I was) shocked, horrified and angry at why someone could do this and leave a note instead of talking to me about it,' the Bundaberg woman said. She received support from many in her Bundaberg community, with one commenter pointing out that 'the lady wearing what she likes, when she likes and where she likes, is her business, and to the low life scum bag that left the note, get a life.' Researchers at the University of London have found that those who are made to feel ashamed about their size are six times as likely to become obese, a study has found. Experts say that being criticised for their weight drives those who are already sensitive about it to comfort eat. Fear of ridicule may also mean they avoid exercise. The study involved almost 3,000 men and women aged 50-plus who were weighed twice, four years apart. They were also asked if they had been discriminated against because of their weight. Examples of this included being treated with disrespect – including being the butt of jokes – receiving poorer service in shops, restaurants, hospitals and doctors’ surgeries, being threatened and being assumed to be stupid. One social media user supported these findings, calling for body image and self-confidence to be put into perspective. Another said, 'Very few of us have flawless figures so I suggest that the individual that felt the need to write this note take a good hard look at themselves first before passing judgement upon others,' 'This individual has well and truly overstepped the mark of common decency. To the lady concerned just continue to be yourself and wear what you are comfortable in.' The Bundaberg woman seemed to take this advice to heart saying that, 'now, I'm like stuff it, why should I be afraid to run around in my bikinis when it's hot.' Another of her supporters applauded this sentiment, telling her to 'Stay strong Bundy lady, keep wearing your bikini and shorts.'","Anonymous post-it note stuck to a Bundaberg woman's door asked her to not wear bikinis or short-shorts in her own front yard .

"A man whose New York City murder conviction was overturned after he spent over 20 years in prison is getting $3.6 million from the state. The Daily News reports Saturday that state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman approved the payout this week in Anthony Yarbough's case. Schneiderman spokeswoman Melissa Grace tells the paper Schneiderman has to ensure that people unjustly imprisoned get justice speedily. Wrongly convicted: Anthony Yarbough (pictured) along with Sharrif Wilson were convicted of killing Yarbough's mother, his 12-year-old sister and another girl in 1992 and spent 20 years behind bars . Yarbough's lawyer, Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma, says the state money will help Yarbough keep pursuing a lawsuit against the city. Margulis-Ohnuma says Yarbough plans to keep working at a hotel. Yarbough and Sharrif Wilson were convicted of killing Yarbough's mother, his 12-year-old sister and another girl in 1992. A judge threw out their convictions in February based on new DNA evidence. Yarbough and pal Sharrif Wilson were 18 and 15 when they were charged in 1992 with stabbing . Wilson's lawyer declined to comment. 'He won’t have to worry about money for quite a long time,' said Yarbough's lawyer, Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma. Yarbough's influx of cash will allow him to take a separate federal lawsuit against the city and the NYPD all the way to trial. New evidence in the case helped to throw out the convictions in February and Yarbough filed a claim in June. The New York Daily News reports that Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who approved the settlement this week, 'is concerned about the rights of the wrongfully convicted, and the obligation the State of New York has to ensure that people who were unjustly jailed — in some cases for decades — get some justice,' according to spokeswoman Melissa Grace. 'The office is working diligently to ensure that those who spent time behind bars get the justice they deserve as speedily as possible.' Five months is supposedly the fastest payout an resolution for a case of its kind in history.

"Sacked: Former priest Stephen Vincent, 40, with his wife Erin, with whom he has three young children . A married priest has been sacked after he was caught having an affair with a member of his congregation. The Rev Stephen Vincent, 40, exchanged hundreds of lurid text messages with the woman, who was also married. He admitted they had sex in an alleyway and on another occasion, after she texted, ‘Come and get me’. When he called at her house she answered the door wearing only a silk dressing gown and knickers. But she accused him of rape and he was arrested. When police dropped their inquiry, the woman, known only as X, complained to Church of England authorities. Mr Vincent was barred from the priesthood and his family face eviction from their home. Yesterday his wife Erin, with whom he has three young children, said she was standing by him because ‘everyone deserves a second chance’. The couple, who have been together for ten years, said the affair and subsequent investigation had left the family ‘on the brink’. ‘I can see how much he regrets it and I don’t think he needs punishing further,’ Mrs Vincent told the Sunday Telegraph. ‘Steve is an amazing person who has made some silly decisions. We have three gorgeous children who mean the world to us, and we both stay strong for them.’ Cambridge-trained Mr Vincent was appointed curate at St Giles Church in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, in 2011 and his family live in a semi-detached house belonging to the church. In April 2012, a few weeks before he was ordained, he was introduced to X, who said she was interested in joining the clergy. At the suggestion of the vicar, Mr Vincent agreed that she could shadow him. They they began exchanging texts – which within two days became flirtatious. On April 27, Mr Vincent wrote that she should ‘send the other half to the park with the kids... get yourself a big glass of red, slip into the bath and enjoy yourself’. On May 25 they met at a local pub and by June 18 the messages – up to 87 a day – had become sexually explicit. After one meeting Mr Vincent said that ‘in different circumstances’ he may have kissed her and she sent him a photograph of herself in her underwear, Lichfield Diocese’s disciplinary panel said in the published report of its findings. Further text messages discussed her preference for wearing stockings and suspenders rather than tights. In June, three days after his ordination, they met at a bar and afterwards had sex against a wall in an alleyway. The following month they met again at a pub where, the panel said, X ‘made it clear she wanted sex’, afterwards texting: ‘I’m home now come and get me.’ Mr Vincent replied by asking for her address, adding: ‘I’ll only be able to f*** and go’. But after they stopped exchanging texts in the early August, X alleged that the second of their two sexual encounters had been rape. When interviewed by police, Mr Vincent insisted that what happened had been ‘roughish’ but he would describe it ‘more as passionate’. He strongly denied it had been anything other than consensual, which the disciplinary panel accepted. Mr Vincent told members he felt ‘deeply sorry’ for hurting and betraying his wife and the Church. St Giles Church: Parishioners were shocked by Mr Vincent’s behaviour and said yesterday that his mistress’s marriage had broken up. Mr Vincent said he felt ‘deeply sorry’ for  betraying his wife and the Church . The panel, chaired by Geoffrey Tattersall, a QC and lay canon at Manchester Cathedral, said his behaviour was ‘incompatible with his continued ministry in the Church’ and barred him from acting as a priest for eight years. Mr and Mrs Vincent, originally from Northern Ireland, have been given until the end of the year to leave their home and he is claiming unemployment benefit. Mr Vincent described the affair as a ‘huge, stupid mistake’, telling the Sunday Telegraph: ‘It has been devastating. In one day I lost my home, my job, and in some ways I nearly lost my family as well. ‘We have been on the brink of breaking up and it is the thing I regret most in my life.’ Of his wife, he said: ‘She is incredibly strong and has been remarkably gracious. I owe her everything.’ Mrs Vincent told the paper she was standing by him because she had been ‘taught to forgive’, adding: ‘We are beginning to see some light now.’ Yesterday Mrs Vincent would say only: ‘This has been a terrible time. I just want to put it behind me and move on with our lives.’ Parishioners were shocked by Mr Vincent’s behaviour and said yesterday that his mistress’s marriage had broken up. Grandmother Paula Dawson, 77, said: ‘He seems a real Jekyll and Hyde character.’ Another said: ‘He has behaved terribly and preyed on this woman.’ In a statement, the diocese said Mr Vincent’s behaviour had been ‘unbecoming of his calling as a priest in Church of England’. It added: ‘As Mr Vincent said himself, he has betrayed his wife, his family and his church. ‘We continue to offer every support to the Vincent family... and hold them all in our prayers.’","Married priest Stephen Vincent admitted he had sex with a churchgoer .

"Forget being sneezed on: Government scientists are deliberately giving dozens of volunteers the flu by squirting the live virus straight up their noses. It may sound bizarre, but the rare type of research is a step in the quest for better flu vaccines. It turns out that how the body fends off influenza remains something of a mystery. 'Vaccines are working, but we could do better,' said Dr. Matthew Memoli of the National Institutes of Health, who is leading the study that aims to infect up to 100 adults over the next year. Scroll down for video . Study: Dr. Matthew Memoli is looking for about 100 people for a flu study that requires people to be infected with the disease . Wait a minute: Flu is sweeping the country, so why not just study the already sick? That wouldn't let scientists measure how the immune system reacts through each step of infection, starting with that first exposure to the virus. It's not an experiment to be taken lightly. After all, the flu kills thousands of Americans a year. For safety, Memoli chose a dose that produces mild to moderate symptoms - and accepts only volunteers who are healthy and no older than 50. And to avoid spreading the germs, participants must spend at least nine days quarantined inside a special isolation ward at the NIH hospital, their health closely monitored. They're not released until nasal tests prove they're no longer contagious. The incentive: About $3,000 to compensate for their time. 'I received a very scolding email from my mother' about signing up, Daniel Bennett, 26, said with a grin. 'Their standards are so high, I don't believe I'm in danger,' added Bennett, a restaurant worker from College Park, Md. 'I don't get sick that often.' A masked and gloved Memoli had Bennett lie flat for about a minute. Infected: Daniel Bennett volunteered to have the flu virus sprayed into his nasal passage as part of the study . 'It will taste salty. Some will drip down the back of your throat,' Memoli said, before squeezing a syringe filled with millions of microscopic virus particles, floating in salt water, into each nostril. Sure enough, a few days later Bennett had the runny nose and achiness of mild flu. The best defense against influenza is a yearly vaccine, but it's far from perfect. In fact, the vaccine is least effective in people age 65 and older - the group most susceptible to flu - probably because the immune system weakens with age. Understanding how younger adults' bodies fight flu may help scientists determine what the more vulnerable elderly are missing, clues to help develop more protective vaccines for everyone, Memoli explained. Here's the issue: The vaccine is designed to raise people's levels of a particular flu-fighting antibody. It targets a protein that acts like the virus' coat, called hemagglutinin - the 'H' in H1N1, the strain that caused the 2009 pandemic and that is causing the most illness so far this winter, too. Isolation: Test subjects like Bennett are required to live in isolation at the hospital for nine days after they are infected . But it's not clear what antibody level is best to aim for - or whether a certain amount means you're protected against getting sick at all, or that you'd get a mild case instead of a severe one. 'As mind-boggling as it is, we don't know the answer to that,' said Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief of NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. 'We made some assumptions that we knew everything about flu.' Just targeting hemagglutinin probably isn't enough, Memoli added. Already, some people in his study didn't get sick, despite remarkably low antibody levels, meaning something else must be protecting them. Could it be antibodies against the 'N' in flu's name, the neuraminidase protein? Specific T cells that are activated to fight infection? Genes that switch on and off when a virus invades? To begin finding out, Memoli first developed a laboratory-grown copy of the H1N1 flu strain and sprayed different amounts into volunteers' noses until he found the right dose to trigger mild flu. He hopes eventually to test the harsher H3N2 strain, too. Now he's infecting two groups - people with low antibody levels and those with high levels. Some were recently vaccinated, and some weren't. He'll compare how sick they get, how long they're contagious and how the immune system jumps into action. Flu: Dr. Memoli handles live doses of the flu virus intended for his test subjects . Called a human challenge study, this kind of research hasn't been performed with flu viruses in the U.S. for more than a decade, before scientists had ways as sophisticated to measure what happens. 'It's all going to add up to a better understanding of what you need to have to be protected against the flu,' said Dr. John Treanor, a flu specialist at the University of Rochester Medical Center who is closely watching the work. So far, Memoli's patients are becoming contagious a day or two before they start feeling bad, one reason the flu spreads so easily.

"Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne has insisted his recent stint in hospital following an apparent alcohol binge was 'just to a little blip' after admitting another relapse could kill him. The 47-year-old, who appeared happy and relaxed as he was spotted grocery shopping near his home in the Sandbanks area of Poole, Dorset, has adopted a healthier lifestyle after declaring: 'The only person who can save me is me.’ Friends claim the former midfielder, who has struggled with alcohol addiction for several years, has taken up a fresh diet and exercise regime less than a month after he was sectioned and put on a three-day emergency detox following a relapse. Scroll down for video . Recovering: Paul Gascoigne is said to be doing well a month after he was sectioned following an apparent alcohol binge. He appeared relaxed out shopping this week near his home in Poole, Bournemouth . Struggle: Friends are said to have credited a new diet and exercise regime, and his girlfriend's support . The former football star, who retired from the game in 2004, blamed his recent 'blip' on boredom but said he felt 'victimised' by doctors who sectioned him. He admitted he had 'messed up' but said he felt he had not done anything wrong to warrant being held at the hospital. He has now vowed to stay on the straight and narrow after listening to doctors' warnings that the booze will kill him. Speaking to The Sun's Mike Hamilton, he said: ‘I know it's true. But as long as I stay how I am now and enjoy life, I will be OK. 'I have had tests on everything - liver, kidneys and heart. And it has all come up fine. I have been very lucky with my liver. ‘There is nothing wrong with me – as long as I don’t pick up a can’. The former England, Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle star, who now prays every morning, claimed he had only drunk for one year out of the last 18 and admitted he was lucky to have nipped his relapses in the bud quickly. Out in public: The star made 57 appearances for England, but later made headlines for different reasons . Homecoming: The trip to the shops was earlier this week (pictured), and today the Gateshead-born Newcastle United legend made a 700-mile round trip to his home city to encourage budding footballers . Gascoigne, who made 57 appearances for England, was first sectioned under the Mental Health Act in 2008 following an incident at a Newcastle hotel. Following his latest sectioning in the early hours of October 24, the star was placed on a three-day emergency detox following an apparent alcohol binge. During his time in hospital, he is said to have taken the opportunity to improve his health and fitness by doing up to 800 press-ups, sit-ups and squats every day. Since returning to his seaside home, he is said to have continued with his exercise regime and his efforts appeared to be paying off when he was spotted shopping for groceries last week. He smiled towards onlookers as he bought groceries including milk and air freshener, alongside a copy of The Sun and Hello! magazine. During his outing to the supermarket, he also visited an off-licence - but only to buy cigarettes. As well as making daily trips to the gym, the former footballer is also  concentrating on his diet and abstaining from alcohol, friends told the Sunday People. He also continues to be supported by his close friend and rumoured girlfriend Mandy Thomas, 44, who has stood by his side throughout the last few turbulent months. They are said to have met and become friendly after Gascoigne visited the post office she runs in Bournemouth, Dorset, several years ago. Past times: The star pictured at a low ebb earlier this year (left), and right in 2012 . Off-licence: The footballing legend visited an off-licence in a taxi, but only to buy cigarettes . First outing: Gascoigne was spotted putting the bins out a week ago in his first public appearance since  being sectioned under the Mental Health Act on October 24. He was seen in a dressing gown and pyjamas . His recent outing comes just seven days after he was spotted putting the bins out in what was his first public appearance since his hospitalisation. He looked downcast as he was spotted carrying out the chore outside his Dorset home wearing a blue dressing gown, tartan pyjama bottoms and slip-on shoes. He was also sporting cuts to his face following a recent fall, but these appear to have healed somewhat and he looked the picture of health during his most recent outing. Following his trip to the shops, the Gateshead-born footballer also made a trip to his home city yesterday to encourage budding footballers. He grinned as he posed with young players from Wallsend Boys FC, with the reaction on Twitter proving his enduring popularity. 'The lads with Gazza after the game today,' said one supporter.

"A couple were told that their five children could be taken away by social services – because the father left their two-year-old alone in a car for just five minutes. Julie and Tim Haines came within a 'hair's breadth' of losing their children after he left their daughter while he popped in to buy Calpol at a chemist's. Mr Haines, 50, returned to be confronted by two police officers who told him he should not have left his toddler in the car. Scroll down for video . The Haines family were nearly torn apart after Tim left his two-year-old daughter Iset (second right) now 11, in the car for less than ten minutes in 2004. Also pictured, his wife Julie and his daughter Kiya, 13 (second left) The family law advocate was subsequently charged with child neglect and his five children placed on a protection register. His wife Julie lost her job as head of music at a private school in Worcester as a result of the proceedings. And the couple spent a year fighting to lift the threat of having the children removed by social services – in what they now describe as a 'life-changing and horrible experience'. Mrs Haines said: 'We won, but we came within a hair's breadth of losing our children. Iset, pictured aged two, was left in the front seat of the car while Mr Haines ran into the chemist to buy Calpol . A few weeks after the incident officers came to Mr Haines' house to arrest him for 'wilful exposure of a child to risk of significant harm'. His five children, pictured, were put on the child protection register . 'We are a respectable middle-class family. It makes you think, if this can happen to us, what child is safe? This could happen to anyone. It has been a nightmare I've struggled to shake off for the past ten years of my life.' The family decided to speak out following the case of Birmingham mother Joan, who was given a criminal record for 'child cruelty' after leaving her six-year-old son alone at home for 45 minutes. The Government is facing calls to pass new laws that will clarify how long children can be left unattended before parents are prosecuted for neglect. Earlier this month John Hemming, the Liberal Democrat MP for Birmingham Yardley, tabled a Parliamentary question seeking clarity. He said yesterday: 'State intervention is actually doing a lot of harm and it might be doing some good as well, but sometimes it's hard to see the good in all the harm. Every family should be interested in this as it could happen to anyone.' When Mr Haines parked on Evesham High Street in Worcestershire back in October 2004, he could not have imagined the 'nightmare' that was to follow. Returning from the school run, he remembered that the family had run out of children's medicine Calpol. Iset's father left her in the car seat, but said he could 'keep an eye on her from the chemist' He made the snap decision to leave his youngest daughter Iset in her car seat while he went to the chemist's – because he could 'keep an eye on her' from the shop as he queued. When he returned to his car, he was confronted by police. He said: 'I thought that was the end of it but a few weeks later they showed up at my house, arrested me and sent social workers in to search my house.' Mr Haines was prosecuted for 'wilful exposure of a child to risk of significant harm' and all the couple's children – who are now aged 11, 13, 14, 20 and 22 – were placed on the child protection register. It took the family nearly a year to have their children's names removed from the register. And in the summer of 2005, Mr Haines finally had his conviction overturned on appeal. He said: 'The prosecution offered no evidence and the court struck the matter out. Hearing what I had done, the judge said: 'Is that supposed to be a crime?' His wife added: 'We were so close to losing everything. It's been a very harrowing experience. I am in a constant state of nervousness now – always looking over my shoulder, wondering what social services could be saying about us. 'All of us have left children unless you happen to have a full-time nanny. I'm sure most parents have left children in the car while they've paid for petrol or gone to the school gates.' The Department for Education said: 'Parents can be prosecuted if they leave a child unsupervised in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury.' West Mercia Police said it had a duty to investigate all concerns regarding the care of children.

"Former Crimewatch presenter Nick Ross has provoked outrage by suggesting ‘rape isn’t always rape’ when the victim is drunk, with a boyfriend, or has gone ‘too far’ in leading a man on. In a new book, Ross adds that it has become ‘sacrilege to suggest there can be any gradation: rape is rape.’ ‘Yet the real experts, the victims, know otherwise. Nick Ross wrote in his new book that 'not all rape is rape' and said that some situations are more complicated . ‘Half of all women who have had penetrative sex unwillingly do not think they were raped and this proportion rises strongly when the assault involves a boyfriend, or if the woman is drunk or high on drugs: they led him on, they went too far, it wasn’t forcible, they didn’t make themselves clear. . . ‘For them, rape isn’t always rape and, however upsetting, they feel it is a long way removed from being systematically violated or snatched off the street.’ Although he insists he is not blaming victims and criticises the ‘booze culture’, Mr Ross’s remarks were yesterday condemned as outdated, misogynistic and immensely damaging by anti-rape campaigners. Jo Woods, a trustee of Rape Crisis, said: ‘I feel absolute fury. I really thought we had moved on from such outdated and ridiculous viewpoints. The comments have sparked fury with feminist groups speaking out against them . ‘I feel sad for the thousands of women who will read these views and believe that finally they have the validation that they must have been to blame – because Nick Ross says so. ‘Such comments do immense damage to victims of sexual violence. They stifle them. They prevent them from coming  forward for the help they  need. These comments are ill-advised, uneducated and quite simply wrong.’ And Victim Support, with which Mr Ross has worked as a ‘media partner’, said Mr Ross’s views were his own and it did not share them. In an extract from his new book Crime, published in today’s Mail on Sunday, Mr Ross suggests victims who do not report the crime to the police might sometimes be right not to do so, adding: ‘What if she feels partly responsible for what happened?’ He also draws parallels between some rape victims and ‘foolish’ people who have their laptops stolen because they leave them on the back seat of their cars. Ross cited 'booze culture' as one of the reasons that the situation is more complicated. He added that our forebears would have been shocked with how women behave these days . Mr Ross, best known for co-hosting BBC1’s Crimewatch with the late Jill Dando, adds: ‘Rape victims were once treated appallingly, as though it was all their fault. But have we gone too far the other way? Many victims seem to think we have.’ He continues: ‘We would laugh at a bank that stored sacks of cash by the front door. We would be aghast if an airport badly skimped on its security. ‘Our forebears might be astonished at how safe women are today given what throughout history would have been regarded as incitement. ‘Not even in the licentious days of the Charles II Restoration in the 17th Century was it acceptable for women to dress as provocatively as they have done in Western culture since the 1960s. ‘Equally they would be baffled that girls are mostly unescorted, stay out late, often get profoundly drunk and sometimes openly kiss, grope or go to bed with one-night stands. ‘No amount of temptation  can excuse rape, or any other crime .  .  . Yet for some it is heresy to suggest that victims should ever be held responsible at all.’ The former journalist, who is now involved in the academic study of crime, relies on academic research for the claim that many women who have been subject to non-compliant sex do not regard themselves as having been raped. Ross is famous for presenting Crimewatch with the late presenter Jill Dando . One research paper, published in the Psychology Of Women Quarterly in September 2003, said it had confirmed a number of earlier studies that had  found that fewer than half of victims categorised their experience as rape. The research, which questioned 89 victims, also found that women were more likely  to believe they were raped if their attacker was not their boyfriend, if they experienced a more forceful assault or if  the experience was particularly upsetting. Mr Ross challenges those who say all cases should be reported to the police: ‘The assumption is that any woman who chooses not to pursue a claim is being let down by the State or is acting irrationally. ‘But could it be that she is right? What if she feels partly responsible for what happened? What if she realises there is no evidence other than her word against his? What if her life is bound up with that of her assailant? What if she feels humiliated as well as violated? Should she be expected to disclose all this in public and put her life on hold for the greater good?’ In separate comments to The Mail on Sunday, Mr Ross said the ‘last thing’ he wanted to do was to blame women for their misfortune. But he added: ‘If it was a one-night stand and things got out of hand and she was drunk and he was drunk, it would be absurd to say she did not contribute.’ But critics last night insisted Mr Ross was suggesting some women were at least partly to blame if they were raped. Sarah Green, a spokesman for the Women Against Violence Coalition, said: ‘Nick Ross sticks with very tired and deeply misogynistic prejudices about “provocative dress”. This is an appalling misrepresentation of what actually happens.’ And Vivienne Hayes, chief executive officer of the Women’s Resource Centre, said: ‘Does Ross think all women and girls should lock themselves away or wear a chastity belt because men and boys are not expected to monitor and control their behaviour?’","Nick Ross has provoked outrage by suggesting ‘rape isn’t always rape’

"Top independent schools are for children of oligarchs as British parents have become priced out of the market, according to a leading headteacher. Andrew Halls, head of King's College School in Wimbledon, south west London, said an 'endless queue' of rich families from outside Britain had led to a rise in fees at the £20,000-a-year school. He claims the 'limitless' costs had forced local lawyers, accountants and military officers to stop sending their children there and it was a 'ticking time-bomb' he likened to the 2008 financial crisis. Andrew Halls, head of King's College School in Wimbledon, says British parents can no longer afford fees as an 'endless queue' of rich families from outside the UK push up costs at the £20,000-per-year school . The 185-year-old school, which has been named by Sunday Times as independent school of the year, charges £19,455 a year for senior school boys aged 13-18 and girls aged 16-18. Mr Halls told the paper: 'We have allowed the apparently endless queue of wealthy families from across the world knocking at our doors to blind us to a simple truth: we charge too much. 'Somewhere along the way, first the nurses stopped sending children to us, then the policemen, the armed forces officers, the even the local accountants and lawyers. 'The most prestigious schools in the world teach children of the very wealthiest families in the world. King's College School was named as independent school of the year, but its headteacher says less local lawyers, military officers and nurses are sending their children their because it 'charges too much' 'We are in danger of coming across as greedy because we can charge what appears to be limitless fees, but in truth there is a fees time-bomb ticking away. It feels like the build-up to the banking crisis.' The cost of sending a child to private schools has risen by about a fifth in the last four years - around four times faster than rises in earnings, according to recent research. Mr Halls suggested a collapse could be brought about by the supply of foreign families eventually drying up, while British families could elect to send their children to high-performing state schools.","King's College School head said many locals can no longer afford fees .

For a glimpse of classic New York elegance, look no further than The Jade Hotel in Greenwich Village . Yunak Everli, set in Urgup in the heart of Cappadocia in Turkey, is a unique cave hotel carved into the side of a mountain. It's nearly impossible to put a date on the cliffs, but the carved-out rooms that visitors can stay in that are believed to date back to the fifth century. Adventurous guests can also head into the nearby underground cities and hidden cavernous churches. In Paris, the Apostrophe Hotel near Saint-Germain-des-Prés is a stylish design hotel complete with an exterior mural of a tree overtaking the front of the building. At night, it's particularly striking, as coloured lights illuminate the facade. And inside, each of the rooms has a unique design inspired by works of literature.

Australia's Thorngrove Manor Hotel is like something out of a fairytale, thanks to its romantic architecture. It's castle-inspired towers and fantastical turrets are just the beginning - the hotel's interiors are equally as spectacular, boasting one-of-a-kind antiques, winding staircases, and escapist artwork.

"For 26 years, Rebecca Vary trudged on through each day as her body broke down beneath her. It wasn't until last year that the now 43-year-old business owner, from Perth in Western Australia, was finally diagnosed with Lyme disease by a doctor that was too afraid to treat her. 'I had a lot of symptoms that were vague and would reappear and disappear for a bit - a lot of things that weren't quite right that I couldn't put my finger on. Then in 1994 I became so fatigued that I couldn't leave my room or bed,' Ms Vary told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's a debilitating fatigue, to the point where you have to make a choice of, ""do I do my hair or have a shower? Because there's no way I can do both if I have to get to work today"". Scroll down for video . Rebecca Vary, 43, suffered from Lyme disease without a diagnosis for 26 years. She suffered from extreme fatigue and was eventually left unable to walk or  speak for long periods of time . About 300,000 Australians are estimated to be living with Lyme disease, which occurs in humans who are bitten by ticks and insects that are infected with Borrelia bacteria . 'I was told I had virus and that's why I was so tired. I'd seen between 12 to 17 doctors for various things that arose over the years and none of them picked it up. A lot of doctors kept saying that, because there was nothing in my blood – but they would just be checking my iron and sugar levels.' The Lyme Disease Association of Australia estimates that about 300,000 Australians are currently living with the bacteria borne illness. It occurs in humans who are bitten by ticks and insects that are infected with the Borrelia bacteria. Sharon Whiteman, the president of the association, told Daily Mail Australia that Lyme disease is a 'hidden epidemic'; despite many Australians presenting symptoms, the illness continues to be dismissed by the government and medical practitioners across the country. 'They have been having trouble isolating the organism in the lab and a very prestigious group did a big study in 1994 that did not find Borrelia in Australian ticks, and so a very blanket statement was made that there is no Borrelia in Australia,' Ms Whiteman said. Many sufferers, like Maddie  Bridgman, are referred to psychologists as the Australian government does not recognise that the infectious disease can be caught in Australia . As a result, many Australians suffering from Lyme disease, like Ms Vary, are told that their pain is all in their head. Source: Lyme Disease Association of Australia . 'They would ship me off to psychiatrists who just kept saying ""I don't know why they keep sending you to me"",' she said. 'You just start to realise, well actually medicine and doctors aren't any help to you and you just have to live as best you can.' Similarly, Maddie and Dean Bridgman, from North Sydney, told Channel Seven's Sunday Night how they were repeatedly turned away by medical practitioners who insisted Mrs Bridgman's sudden seizures and inability to walk were due to a psychological problem. 'The top neurologist in Sydney said ""it's all in your head, go away"",' Mr Bridgman said. 'It's hard to have a nurse yell at your wife and say, ""you're making this up, stop shaking,"" when you know that there's something wrong, when you know that it's not all in her head.' It wasn't until May last year that Mrs Bridgman, who was suffering 11 seizures a day and had been turned away by three doctors and three hospitals, found out that she had Lyme disease when her blood was sent to the US for testing. With doctors in Australia unable to treat the illness as the testing methods and results are not officially recognised, patients like Ms Vary and Mrs Bridgman are being forced to travel as far as Germany to be treated. Both women attended Klinik St George hospital in Bad Aibling where they received scientifically unproven hypothermia treatment – a procedure in which an artificial fever is stimulated by heating the patient's body to up to 41.7 degrees. After spending $55,000 on the controversial treatment, Mrs Bridgman can not only walk again, but has resumed studying her nursing degree. Ms Bridgman was left barely able to walk (left) and suddenly began suffering from intense seizures up to 11 times a day (right) 'It's hard to have a nurse yell at your wife and say, ""you're making this up, stop shaking"" when you know that there's something wrong, when you know that it's not all in her head,' Dean Bridgman, Maddie's husband, said .

Both women attended Klinik St George hospital in Bad Aibling where they received scientifically unproven hypothermia treatment (pictured) – a procedure in which an artificial fever is stimulated by heating the patient's body to up to 41.7 degrees . Ms Vary, who has suffered from Lyme disease since the age of 17, has also noticed life changing improvements after undertaking multiple treatments at two different German clinics and another in Indonesia. 'I can stand up in a queue in a supermarket now - I couldn't do that before I went to Germany. I can walk now, I can do daily tasks, I couldn't hold conversation for a long time, I hadn't had an appetite for more than 10 years – that has returned,' she said. 'My ability to dream has come back, I have no more heart problems, there's no pain in my fingers and hands or sensation of skin crawling, I even look better. People say to me ""if I had a before and after photo, no one would believe I was the same person"", don't look so sick any more.'

Ms Vary, who has suffered from Lyme disease since the age of 17, has also noticed life changing improvements after undertaking multiple treatments at two different German clinics and  another in Indonesia . But while their bodies continue to heal, the fight is not over, as Australian doctors continue to dismiss the possibility of Lyme disease being caught in Australia as well as patient's test results from overseas. Sharon Whiteman from the Lyme Disease Association of Australia is calling for the government and medical boards to 'recognise that patients are becoming sick from tick bites'. 'Most people are only getting confirmation that they have the disease from overseas from specialist Lyme testing labs. Those tests are being dismissed as inadequate in Australia because they are not NATA (National Association of Testing Authorities, Australia) accredited,' she said. 'There are only two labs in Australia that are accredited to test for Lyme and those processes have discrepancies. 'The Chief Medical Officer found blood tests are relied upon but are unreliable.

"Shamed former News of the World editor Andy Coulson was spotted leaving his home early this morning following his early release from jail yesterday. The ex-Tory communications chief was let out of Hollesley Bay, an open prison in Suffolk, less than five months into an 18-month prison sentence for phone hacking. He was seen driving his car bright and early this morning as he left his home in Kent, wearing a black coat and blue T-shirt. Coulson was seen walking his dog later this morning as he carried a stack of the national morning papers . Andy Coulson was earlier seen leaving his home in Kent this morning after being released from prison yesterday . A man and woman in a white van arrived at his home yesterday to fit him with an electronic tag, which he must wear as a condition of his early release. If Coulson fails to stay within the set vicinity of the monitoring device outside curfew hours then police will be alerted and he could be returned to prison. He was jailed on July 4 after being found guilty of conspiring to intercept voicemails at the now-defunct Sunday tabloid following an eight-month trial at the Old Bailey. The Ministry of Justice declined to comment on an individual prisoner but said inmates can be released under home detention arrangements before they have served half of their term. The ex-Tory communications chief wore jeans, a blue T-shirt and a black coat as he took a morning stroll . Today is Coulson's first full day of freedom after he was released from early from prison yesterday morning . A spokesman said: 'Public protection is our first priority. Only prisoners who pass a strict risk assessment can be released on home detention curfew (HDC). 'Offenders on HDC are subject to strict licence conditions and can be recalled to prison if they breach them.' Prisoners can be considered for HDC if they are serving a sentence of more than three months and less than four years and have served a quarter of their sentence. During his trial, a senior judge at the Old Bailey said that he had to take a 'major share of the blame' for the phone hacking at the News of the World, in which the voicemails of thousands of people were unlawfully accessed. A woman arrives at Coulson's home carrying a box labelled 'Special HMU' - containing the electronic tag he must now wear as a a condition of his early release . HMU: Home Monitoring Unit is unloaded from the back of a van by a man and woman at Mr Coulson's home . The victims included celebrities, politicians, the murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler and members of the royal family. When the defendant returns home from court or prison a supplier will attend the curfew address to install the monitoring equipment during curfew hours. They will fit  a transmitter device, the tag, to the defendant - around their ankle. The supplier will also install a receiver device, the monitoring unit, in a suitable location in the property. The tag sends radio signals to the monitoring unit at frequent intervals, typically once every 30 seconds or so. The two devices are calibrated so that if the defendant leaves the curfew address the signal from the tag no longer reaches the monitoring unit. The monitoring unit stores the signals from the tag and transmits them to a monitoring centre staffed by the supplier’s employees. Source: Home Office guidance . Coulson, 46, initially spent two months in Category A Belmarsh prison, in south London, alongside terrorists and other dangerous inmates – longer than is usual for a crime such as hacking. He was then moved to Hollesley Bay, a minimum security jail in Suffolk. The 421-inmate Category D prison which is spread over 85 acres is often nicknamed Holiday Bay because of its sea views and easy-going regime. Coulson was housed in a cell in the prison's Hoxon induction unit which is also where shamed Tory Lord Jeffrey Archer served his sentence for perjury and perverting the course of justice following a News of the World sting. Other inmates said Coulson had been given a job in the prison as an education orderly which involved being a classroom assistant, helping to educate prisoners. Millionaire author Archer who was released in 2003 worked in the prison library. Many of the prisoners have jobs outside the prison in places like factories and charity shops, but it is believed that Coulson was considered too high-profile to work in the local community . There was a mixed response from prisoners about how well regarded Coulson was at the jail. Coulson appeared outside his home in Kent yesterday afternoon clutching a large bouquet of flowers . Coulson was picked up from Hollesley Bay open prison in Suffolk - five months into an 18-month sentence . One inmate said: 'Most prisoners just ignored him. What his newspaper did, hacking the phones of dead people, was bang out of order. There are plenty of criminals here, but we have some morals.' Another prisoner said: 'He was a fantastic chap who was always friendly and had the time to talk to anyone. He had a job in the classroom and he helped a lot of people. 'He had what was considered as quite a nice job in the prison. But it suited his skills. He was certainly was not given any special treatment. 'Apart from working, he volunteered as a mentor, helping individual prisoners to learn how to read and write. It was a pleasure to do time with him. 'He kept quite active and took part in a variety of sports including badminton. I wish him all the best for the future.' Coulson's sentence has been calculated under a complicated set of rules known as the Home Detention Curfew Scheme. The 46-year-old left Hollesley Bay, an open prison in Suffolk, yesterday and must now wear an electrnoic tag . This allows non-violent inmates sentenced to 18 months or more to spend the last 135 days or less at home, wearing a tag. In Coulson's case, his 18-month sentence was halved – as happens in all bar the most serious cases - then had the further reduction made under HDC rules. However, his ordeal will not be at an end when he leaves open prison. In August, prosecutors in Scotland announced he faces a series of perjury charges over the Tommy Sheridan trial. Coulson is alleged to have lied while giving evidence at the trial in December 2010. He is accused of knowing there was a culture of phone hacking at the News of the World while he was editor but denying it while on oath. Following his conviction in July, the Prime Minister apologised for hiring Coulson as a Tory spin doctor and, later, the communications chief at Number Ten. David Cameron said it was 'the wrong decision'.

"They were supposed to be getting a good view of the sea during a walk along the Newquay coastline. But three intrepid tourists got into difficulty when they failed to remember the tide was coming in. The trio were left stranded and desperately calling for help as the water started to come in around the rock they were standing on. Scroll down for video . Three walkers had to be rescued by a lifeboat crew after they became stuck on a rock as they walked along the beach near Newquay and had lost track of time and were unaware the tide was coming in, trapping them . A lifeboat crew rescued them just minutes before the rock became completely submerged because of the incoming tide. The lifeboat was dispatched to rescue the walkers after attempts to pluck them from the rock using a harness had to be abandoned because parts of the cliff started to give way. 'The timing was perfect, within minutes of them being rescued the area they were standing was completely underwater,' said Chris Charlton, who witnessed the dramatic rescue. 'Once they got into the lifeboat it was so rough the boat nearly tipped over with them all inside. 'It's a popular walking spot but unfortunately people don't think about the times of the tides and they get caught. 'It is really not that far from where those poor surfers drowned a few weeks ago, people need to be aware of how dangerous the sea can be. Rescuers had to abandon efforts to save the trio using a harness because rock and shale started to crumble . The trio were left surrounded by sea as the tide started to come in at Whipsiderry beach and Watergate Bay . A lifeboat was dispatched to save the trio before the rock they had been  on was completely submerged . 'Thankfully these three people were all rescued safely, but they were within minutes of it being a totally different kettle of fish.' The two men and a woman had become trapped on a rock as they walked along Whipsiderry beach and Watergate Bay near Newquay. It is thought they became stranded after losing track of time and the incoming tide. Witnesses said the lifeboat looked like it would tip over several times as the crew tried to rescue the walkers . The three people were taken to safety by the lifeboat crew who battled the incoming tides to rescue them . The Coastguard was called out at about 3pm last Sunday after it received reports of the stranded trio. When attempts to rescue them from above failed as rocks and shale started to give way, the RNLI was called. Two rigid-inflatable boats (RIB) were sent to the scene to try and remove the walkers by sea. The three had reportedly lost track of time and were unaware of the tides while out exploring the coast . Earlier attempts to rescue the three walkers had to be abandoned after shale and rock started to crumble . The Newquay inshore lifeboat and the Newquay and Padstow Coastguard crew attended. A spokesman from the UK Coastguard said: 'When going on the beach or the coast we ask people to please make sure they check the tide times and have an exit strategy.' Whipsiderry beach is just three miles from Mawgan Porth, where three surfers died as they tried to rescue teens caught in a rip tide last month.","Three walkers had been exploring the coastline near Newquay, Cornwall .

"MPs are calling for VAT to be scrapped on flights for children in order to save the average family around £200 on their summer holiday. More than 30 MPs of all parties are backing a motion to stop charging Air Passenger Duty on flights for children who are between the ages of two and 11. They say that families with school-age children already pay a premium for having to travel in the school holidays, and should not have to pay extra punitive taxes. MPs say families with school-age children already pay a premium for having to travel in the school holidays, and should not have to pay extra punitive taxes (posed by models) Travelling in economy class on a long-haul flight to Florida attracts at least £94 in tax per person, so scrapping the tax would save a family with two children nearly £200. For a short-haul flight to Spain, the tax adds £13 to the cost for every passenger. Nearly four out of five British adults (78 per cent) say that an annual family holiday should be part of every child’s life, according to a poll by ComRes out today. And three-quarters of UK adults believe that it is unfair that British families pay a flight tax while families from other countries do not get charged. The poll was commissioned by a campaign group called Scrap the Tax on Family Flights, which has pointed out that the Air Passenger Duty paid by British families is the highest in the world. Only four other European countries levy a similar tax, and UK passengers pay the most, more than double the next highest country, Germany. Even families who are planning a ‘staycation’ can be hit by the tax if they decide to take a domestic flight. Two-thirds of those polled said that children under 12 should be exempt from Air Passenger Duty in the same way that children are exempt from other taxes, such as VAT on clothing and some food. Only four other European countries levy a similar tax, and UK passengers pay the most, more than double the next highest country, Germany (stock image) Dale Keller, a spokesman for the campaign, said: ‘The tax on children’s flights is a strain on family budgets. ‘Given that the tax is levied at the highest rates in the world, this tax surely fails to meet the Government’s own “family test”. ‘Scrapping Air Passenger Duty on children’s flights will help to make an annual holiday more affordable for hard-working and hard-pressed families, at a minimal cost to the Government.’ Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, the sponsor of the Early Day Motion which has been signed by MPs, said: ‘It’s important that hard-working families across the UK have the opportunity to enjoy a family holiday once a year. ‘Scrapping the tax on children’s flights is a great way for the Government to help by making holidays more affordable. I am calling on the Government to scrap the tax on children’s flights and help families enjoy the well-earned break they deserve.’ Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It is wrong that a week in the sun comes with such a huge tax bill, as the taxman chases holidaymakers all the way to the departure gate. ‘These taxes are not only too high but hit those on lower incomes the hardest. ‘Stealth taxes are unfair and must be abolished. It is time for the Chancellor to give families a break.’","MPs back motion to stop charging Air Passenger duty for children .

"Two of Britain's biggest supermarkets have announced that they will cover up the front pages of newspapers over fears that children are being exposed to graphic pictures and headlines. Waitrose and Tesco have said that they are working on new display methods that will show only the mastheads of some newspapers - keeping explicit content out of the eye line of children. The move comes following months of pressure from campaign groups No More Page 3 and Child Eyes, who have heralded the decision a victory. Changes: Tesco and Waitrose have said that they are working on new display methods that will show only the mastheads of some newspapers - keeping explicit content out of the eye line of children. (File image) Both groups expressed concern at sexualised images of women and other unsuitable images being presented at such an easily-accessible height. They also argued that explicit and sensationalist headlines shouldn't be displayed so prominently. Tesco said that it is working on new 'display cubes' that will only display the names of newspapers in vertical panels along the side of the unit. Current cases allow the whole front page to be seen. A spokesman for the supermarket had made the decision after consulting with customers and campaigners. He confirmed that all large outlets, known as Extra and Superstore shops, will receive the new display units by the end of November 2014. Tesco's Customer Experience & Insight Director, Tracey Clements, said that she thought the new units would 'strike the right balance for everyone'. She said: 'We are first and foremost a family retailer and it's important we do everything we can to promote the right environment in store. 'We've asked our customers what they think about the issue and we have spoken to campaigners. The change we're making will strike the right balance for everyone.' A Waitrose spokesman said: 'We've been working on this for some time and will soon be changing our newspaper fixtures so we can display some newspaper covers out of the eye line of children.' He added that the changes will be made 'soon' but did not specify when this would be. Founded in 2012, Child Eyes campaigns to stop sexualised, sexist and damaging images being displayed at child height in shops and public spaces. Co-founder Claire Riseborough, along with representatives from No More Page 3, consulted with Tesco on the decision. She also revealed that that the group is arranging to meet with Waitrose next week. She told MailOnline: 'We are absolutely thrilled that Tesco has made this huge decision to change the way they display newspapers. Graphic: Child Eyes argues that newspapers  are frequently displayed at children’s eye level, often right next to the comics that children are drawn to, and use easy-to-read words which catch their attention. (File image) 'It is also fantastic to hear from Waitrose today that they too will be following suit, we are arranging a meeting with them next week. 'This is a real victory for all the supporters of the Child Eyes Campaign, who have been trying to make their voices heard on this issue for so long. 'We're feeling really positive and excited that the other supermarkets, and then also smaller shops will follow on to make the UK more family friendly. A spokeswoman from No More Page 3 added that the move wasn't just about protecting children - explaining that adult shoppers often felt that the offensive images and language couldn't be avoided. Stephanie Davies-Aria told MailOnline that the group was 'thrilled' with Tesco's decision to change their display units. She said: 'We are really happy that they have taken a step that is realistic for them'.","Waitrose and Tesco will roll out new display cases for newspapers .

"A yellow Ferrari bought by Elton John when he first became famous in 1972 has gone on sale for £300,000. The Ferrari Dino 246GT, one of fewer than 500, belonged to the singer for six months before he gave it to longstanding drummer, Nigel Olsson. Having changed hands another five times since, it is expected to fetch £280,000 at a London auction at the end of the month. Scroll down for video . The Ferrari 246GT was bought by Elton John in 1972 following the success of his single Crocodile Rock. It is being sold at auction in London and is expected to fetch £280,000 . The bright yellow car is one of just 498 original models supplied to the UK in right-hand configuration . Sir Elton bought the flamboyant vehicle following the whirlwind success of his single, Crocodile Rock, in the early 1970s. He racked up 5,000 miles in the six months that he owned the car before handing it on to Mr Olsson in June 1973. It remained in the drummer's possession for a year before being sold to a private buyer. In the 1990s the car broke down in Italy, and was forced to undergo a major overhaul. It now boasts a two-litre, four-cam V6 engine capable of powering it to speeds of almost 150mph. After being sold four more times and clocking up 29,000 miles, it is being sold at Bonhams auction house on November 30.

Five-and-half-million dogs owners will put their pets at risk this Christmas by feeding them harmful food, a worrying new study reveals. The research shows 61 per cent of owners will let their dogs join them round the table for Christmas dinner. Shockingly, 56 per cent will feed their pet potentially harmful human foods - despite knowing it can be severely damaging.

It found an alarming 15 per cent have taken their pet to the vet over Christmas because it has fallen ill from eating human food. The research reveals 71 per cent admit feeding their dog turkey in gravy and 28 per cent give them stuffing - both of which can lead to vomiting and diarrhoea.

"A student from London was left temporarily blind after surgery to change the colour of her eyes. Shenise Farrell travelled to Panama, in Central America, for the unregulated procedure to change her eye colour from dark brown to light brown. She spent £8,000 on the operation but it went wrong and she was almost left permanently blind. Scroll down for video . Shenise Farrell travelled to Panama for surgery to change the colour of her eyes from dark brown to light brown. The procedure went wrong and she ended up temporarily blind . Ms Farrell decided in 2009 that she wanted to change the colour of her eyes and so she began researching surgical options. Despite her family’s horror, she travelled to Panama to have a procedure which involved implanting coloured discs – like a contact lenses – into her eyes. Ms Farrell told Channel 5’s Botched Up Bodies: 'I was so determined to get the surgery nothing rang alarm bells for me - nothing obvious.' When Ms Farrell arrived at the clinic in Panama, she was told that she could not have the light brown implants as they were out of stock. As a result, the surgeon informed her that she would be given blue implants instead. Despite this not being her original intention, she decided to go ahead with the operation. When Ms Farrell arrived at the clinic, she was told the brown implants were 'out of stock' and she agreed to have blue ones instead . Ms Farrell says that during the procedure she screamed and the surgeon told her not to scream as it 'could cause things to go wrong'. To her huge shock, at the end of the 20 minute procedure, Ms Farrell realised she couldn’t see properly. She says it was as though she was looking underwater but the surgeon told her not to worry and that for some patients it took up to two weeks for vision to return to normal. However, by the time Ms Farrell returned to London her sight had deteriorated further. After the operation in Panama, her sight deteriorated rapidly and when she returned to London she had to have another operation (pictured) to remove the implants and save her sight . Even after she had the implants removed, it was three months before Ms Farrell's sight returned to normal . She went to Charing Cross Hospital where she was unable even to read the biggest letter on the optician’s chart. Doctors at the hospital had never seen anything like it so were temporarily at a loss as to how to help her. Eventually, it was decided that the implants had to be removed. Ms Farrell risked permanent blindness to go under the knife again. This time, surgeons made an incision in her corneas to allow them to remove the implants. Ms Farrell said: ‘When I woke up I saw black. I panicked. I thought if my vision goes, my life will be over.' Ms Farrell says she no longer minds what colour her eyes are - all that matters is that she can still see . However, the blackness she saw was only caused by the bandaged surgeons had placed over her eyes. When these were removed, she was able to see again but her vision was blurry. It took two to three months for her vision to return to normal. She said: 'Now that my eyes are back to normal, my eyes are brown but it doesn’t matter what shade of brown it is. The main thing is that I can see.' Botched Up Bodies will be shown on Channel 5 at 10pm tomorrow.","Shenise Farrell wanted to change her eye colour from dark brown to light brown so, in 2009, she flew to Central America for cosmetic surgery .

"Matthew Dobson, 40, was high on drugs when he stole a car and crashed it through fence at airport . A car thief smashed through airport fencing and drove down a runway as a KLM passenger flight on its last drops of fuel came in to land. Matthew Dobson, 40, was high on drugs when he stole the Renault Clio and and drove at 80mph towards Humberside Airport in Lincolnshire, where he used to work, a court heard. He was jailed for three years and eight months at Grimsby Crown Court yesterday after pleading guilty to burglary, driving offences and a charge of recklessly endangering an aircraft. The court heard that all flights taking off and landing at the airport on August 5 had be stopped, including a KLM passenger flight from Amsterdam, which can carry up to 85 passengers. 'It was put in a holding pattern and had seven minutes left to divert to a different airfield to ensure it had enough fuel left to land somewhere safely,' the CPS said in a statement. He also drove underneath the path of a helicopter, which was carrying 11 passengers and was in the process of taking off. Dobson sped the full length of the runway before driving off it and landing in a nearby field, where he was found lying in the grass trying to hide himself, according to the Grimsby Telegraph. Airport emergency crew leader Lee Power and stationed firefighter, Stephen Huteson, approached Dobson who denied knowledge of the car and instead claimed he was a farmer. The pair claimed that he appeared 'agitated and under the influence of intoxicant'. Prosecutors said his 'bizarre' crime spree began when he stole the keys to the Renault Clio from a house in Grimsby and drove off, leaving the car's owner locked in her property. The window cleaner then led police on a high-speed chase through peak-hour traffic towards Humberside Airport, where he crashed through mesh fencing and on to the runway. A KLM passenger flight from Amsterdam, which can carry up to 85 passengers, was on its last drops of fuel as it attempted to land at the airport as the incident unfolded . Yorkshire and Humberside Crown advocate Jeremy Evan said: 'This bizarre crime spree was extraordinarily dangerous and reckless, putting many people's lives at risk. 'Matthew Dobson acted with utter impunity and demonstrated a complete and appalling lack of concern for his or anyone else's safety. 'He took it upon himself to commit this series of offences and it was sheer fortune that no tragedy occurred that day.' Defending, Ketya Saudek said Dobson had started taking amphetamines after his life 'spiralled out of control' following the breakdown of his marriage. He had previously used the drug for five years to help ease pain after being diagnosed with fibromyalgia - an agonising condition. Dobson, who used to work at Humberside Airport (pictured), crashed through the mesh security fencing and onto the runway before landing in a field. He tried to hide in grass and when approached said he was a farmer . He had been sectioned under the mental health act and had been released from hospital a week before the offence. Miss Saudek told the court that Dobson had a window cleaning business, a mortgage, a marriage and children and not been a trouble to the law. She said: 'He is extremely remorseful, he is extremely ashamed of himself, he feels he has let himself down, more particularly he has let his family down and his children down.' Sentencing Dobson, Recorder Andrew Dallas said it was pure luck that no one was hurt. He said: 'You caused considerable distress, considerable concern and well over £1,000 of damage.'","Matthew Dobson, 40, was high on drugs when he stole a Renault Clio .

"Amber's incredible beauty and unique ability to preserve fragments of history are the subject of a new exhibition at a Scottish museum. Visitors to the National Museum of Scotland will be able to marvel at real-life pieces of history in the Amazing Amber exhibition - and the amber-topped cane from Jurassic Park that made the material famous. The fossilised tree resin sometimes contains prehistoric insects and plant life caught in the sticky fluid millions of years ago. Honey hue: Esme Haigh from National Museum Scotland holds a 15-20million year old piece of Mexican amber with a wasp . Prop: The cane with a replica mosquito in amber that was used in the film Jurassic Park . Alongside hundreds of real pieces, the Edinburgh museum will also feature the iconic walking cane from the 1993 movie Jurassic Park, in which DNA retrieved from a mosquito trapped in amber was used to clone dinosaurs. The exhibition explores the many facets of a beautiful and versatile material that has been treasured for thousands of years and reveals the origins, properties and uses of this precious substance. It explores how scientists are continuing to make exciting new discoveries based on life forms preserved in amber. Actor Richard Attenborough with the amber cane in a scene from Jurassic Park . Found all over the world, amber, fossilised tree resin, can vary widely in appearance and has many different uses. On display will be pieces from across the globe, from Borneo to the Baltic, Sicily to Scotland. Used for centuries as a decorative artefact, amber was also treasured for its perceived magical powers, crafted into charms and amulets to heal and ward off evil spirits. Curator Dr Andrew Ross said: ‘The beauty of amber and the three-dimensional life forms captured inside many of the pieces tell us so much about our Earth’s incredible history.’ Relics: The exhibition contains 320 objects with over half having never previously been shown . However, the exhibition debunks the science used in Jurassic Park to clone dinosaurs, even though it did lead to a rise in funding of extracting DNA from amber. Dr Andrew Ross said: 'I used to work at the Natural History Museum and we did get funding to try to get insect DNA from amber but we weren’t successful. 'We’ve gathered a few bits of merchandise from Jurassic Park and we’ve got video clips from the film and will be explaining why the science behind it wouldn’t have worked,' he told The Scotsman.","The beautiful material preserves insects from millions of years ago .

"American Sniper is a blockbuster hit, but that does not mean it's universally loved. The film has become a political point of controversy between left-wing filmmakers who think the movie is propaganda and conservative politicians dedicated to deafening the memory of slain Navy SEAL Chris Kyle whose memoir inspired the film. The Academy Award-nominated movie stars Bradley Cooper as real-life Navy SEAL Kyle, who became the deadliest sniper in U.S. history for making more than 150 kills. He was tragically killed just a few years after leaving the military, allegedly by a fellow soldier struggling with PTSD. Michael Moore was the first to speak out against the film on Twitter last week by calling snipers 'cowards'. He has continued to rant about both the film and the Iraq War for the past two weeks while American Sniper has set box-office records. Meanwhile, conservatives like Sarah Palin have been calling Moore out for his 'disrespect' of U.S.troops. Scroll down for video . Strong words: Sarah Palin criticized Michael Moore's outspoken reaction to the film American Sniper, while attending the Iowa Freedom Summit this weekend. Pictured above with Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Meyer (left), who brought the sign to the event . Critic: Michael Moore sparked controversy last week when he called snipers 'cowards' in a Twitter rant, and later said that his statements were not a criticism of the film . While attending the Iowa Freedom Summit this weekend, the former vice presidential candidate posed with Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Meyer, who held up a sign reading 'F*** you Michael Moore'. She then told the audience that 'what the poster said is what the rest of us are thinking'. The ex-Alaskan governor previously issued a statement about Moore's tirade, saying: 'Hollywood leftists: while caressing shiny plastic trophies you exchange among one another while spitting on the graves of freedom fighters who allow you to do what you do, just realize the rest of America knows you're not fit to shine Chris Kyle's combat boots.' On Saturday, Moore spoke out yet again about the movie, using theology to argue that his stance on snipers was right. Answering the Christian mantra 'What would Jesus Do?' Moore said that he 'wouldn't put any soldiers lives in harm's way in the first place because he wouldn't have sent them to Iraq'. 'Instead of being a sniper to protect our troops, I tried to save their lives by stopping Bush from sending them to their deaths in Iraq,' he added. He later posted a protracted message on Facebook, arguing that he loves soldiers the most because he was an outspoken critic of the Iraq War, and never would have sent them abroad to begin with if he had the choice. The post also includes more than a dozen ways he has supported the military including charity work that helps get veterans jobs and treatment for PTSD as well as setting up website that offered his books and videos to soldiers for free.

'American hero': Chris Kyle, pictured above in 2012, a year before his death, has been defended by the likes of Sarah Palin . Moore was also lambasted by Debbie Lee, the mother of a slain Navy SEAL, at a fundraising event attended by Kyle's widow Taya Kyle this weekend. The mother of Marc Alan Lee, the first Navy SEAL killed in action during Operation Iraqi Freedom, challenged Moore to go through military training. 'It means so much to know that there are so many people out here who continue to support what we’re doing in the memory of Chris, in the memory of Marc,' Debbie Lee said. 'And I don’t know if you guys heard, but I challenged Michael Moore that all of you snipers out there will run him through training. Just one day, we won’t even make him go to combat. See if we can educate him.' While Moore has been the target of many defenders of American Sniper, he isn't the movie's only critic. Bill Maher described the blockbuster as a film about a 'psychopath' killer, while Seth Rogen was forced to clarify his comments when he compared the movie to a fake Nazi propaganda short included in the Quentin Tarantino film Inglorious Basterds. Maher, speaking on his HBO show Real Time with Bill Maher, drew on excerpts from the autobiography Kyle wrote before he was killed in February 2013, in which he said he enjoyed war and referred to his targets as 'savages'. Charged: Bill Maher also criticized the film recently, saying American Sniper was about a 'psychopath' killer . He chose parts of the book, also called American Sniper, where Kyle said 'I love killing bad guys - even with the pain I loved what I was doing.' Maher also quoted the line 'maybe war isn't really fun but I certainly was enjoying it', as well as a point at which he said 'I hate the damn savages', in reference to the at least 160 people he shot dead in his time as a Navy SEAL. The film, directed by Clint Eastwood, was then compared with Hurt Locker, another film centered on the Iraq war which made far less money, though won widespread praise. Maher said: 'Hurt Locker' made $17million because it was a little ambiguous and thoughtful... [American Sniper] is just ""American hero! He's a psychopath patriot, and we love him.""' Rogen, on the other hand, stated in a Twitter post that American Sniper reminded him of a movie included in Inglorious Basters about a Nazi sniper.  He later said that he did not mean to criticize American Sniper, and that his tweet was just a comment about how the two have a similar focus. The controversies do not appear to have harmed the fortunes of the film, which brought in $107million on its first weekend and has earned six Academy Awards nominations.","Filmmaker went on Twitter and Facebook rant this weekend, defending his comments on American Sniper .
