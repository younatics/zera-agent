"Everton fans may not have enjoyed their side's goalless draw against Swansea on Saturday, but they will be pleased to see Belgian star Kevin Mirallas recovering well from his injury. The former Olympiacos forward has been out since picking up a hamstring injury in the Merseyside derby in September, but he looked in rude health while training in the gym. The 27-year-old posted the video of himself, and said: 'Training hard!!! Play hard!!! Back soon.' The former Olympaicos forward is put through his paces in training as he recovers from a hamstring injury . The Belgian international's training regime consisted of jogging in the gym while fighting against the pull of an elasticated waistband. Everton have struggled without Mirallas. Roberto Martinez's side are eight in the Premier League with just three wins from their 10 games. The Blues missed the opportunity the move ahead of rivals Liverpool on Saturday after Brendan Rodgers' side lost 1-0 to Newcastle. Next up for Everton is a Europa League clash with French side Lille. The 27-year-old Belgian posted the video which demonstrated part of his training regime . After Everton's 0-0 draw with Swansea, the club's supporters will hope to see him sooner rather than later .

"Mark Williams claimed his first victory over Ronnie O'Sullivan in a ranking event for 12 years at the International Championship in China. The Welshman had lost eight consecutive ranking matches against O'Sullivan but he recovered from a 3-0 deficit in Chengdu to win 6-5 and set up a semi-final with Mark Allen on Saturday. Two-time world champion Williams, 39, is chasing his first ranking title since the 2011 German Masters and breaks of 120, 59 and 77 gave him momentum and helped him to five frames in a row before O'Sullivan fought back to set up a decider. Mark Williams has progressed to the semi-final of the International Championship in China . Williams had first chance and made 50 before running out of position. O'Sullivan cross-doubled a red to give himself a chance to counter, but then missed a tricky black and Williams doubled a red himself before adding 22 to seal the result. 'I haven't beaten him for so long, eventually I've got rid of that pain,' world number 22 Williams told worldsnooker.com. 'I was shocking for the first few frames and dragged Ronnie down, but after the interval I was a different player. 'It's an excellent win for me, even though Ronnie wasn't at his best. He's still the best player in the world.' Five-time world champion O'Sullivan, who is yet to win a title this season, said: 'We both started poorly and I was struggling with my concentration. 'Then he played well to go 5-3. He's in good touch. At 5-3 I felt I had to make something happen, and that was the best I felt in the match.' The Welshman beat Ronnie O'Sullivan in a ranking event for the first time in 12 years to progress . Allen also had to come from behind as he overturned a 3-1 deficit to beat Michael White 6-3, the Ulsterman reeling off five frames in a row with top breaks of 84, 76, 58 and 58. 'Even at 3-1 down I felt that if I played well I would go on to win, and I did that after the interval,' said world number eight Allen, who is targeting his fourth final of the season having won the Paul Hunter Classic and finished runner-up at the Riga Open and Shanghai Masters. 'I've been practising hard this season and I'm getting results.' Robert Milkins will play Ricky Walden in Friday's semi-final, the former edging past Marco Fu 6-5 in a high quality contest to reach the fifth ranking semi-final of his career. Gloucester potter Milkins won the deciding frame against Fu with a clinical 70 finish, while Walden, who has won both of his two previous world ranking titles in China, cruised into the last four with three centuries in a 6-1 defeat of Jamie Burnett. The winner of the title on Sunday will receive £125,000, the biggest prize on offer in snooker outside the UK.","Mark Williams beats Ronnie O'Sullivan 6-5 at International Championship .

"Each week Sportsmail gathers up the ratings from our team of reporters to provide the best Premier League starting XI of the day. Saturday saw Newcastle inflict more damage on Liverpool's season, while Chelsea struggled to a 2-1 win against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Alexis Sanchez was the star man for Arsenal again in a 3-0 victory over Burnley, while West Ham came from two goals down to rescue a point against Stoke. Here is our team of the day. GK - Tom Heaton (BURNLEY vs Arsenal) - 8 . Sami Mokbel at the Emirates Stadium . Conceding three goals may not look good on paper, but had it not been for Heaton in sublime form between the sticks on Saturday Arsenal would have been on for a thrashing against Burnley. The English goalkeeper denied Santi Cazorla, Lukas Podolski and Theo Walcott with fine saves to keep the score down on Saturday. Tom Heaton may have been beaten three times on Saturday but he was in inspired form . DEF - Daryl Janmaat (NEWCASTLE vs Liverpool) - 7.5 . Craig Hope at St James' Park . Strong in the tackle – upending Balotelli at the cost of a booking – but was purposeful in attack as well, although he was lucky to avoid second yellow. Janmaat was extremely energetic as Newcastle outplayed Liverpool. Daryl Janmaat was solid in defence and dangerous going forward as Newcastle beat Liverpool 2-0 . DEF - Geoff Cameron (STOKE CITY vs West ham) - 7.5 . Laurie Whitwell at the Britannia Stadium . Not usually highlighted for his attacking play, but the versatile American set up Victor Moses for Stoke's first of the afternoon and could have had a goal of his own were it not for a fine save from Adrian. Cameron will just be kicking himself his side let a two-goal lead slip. Geoff Cameron had a huge helping hand in the first goal as Stoke City and West Ham drew 2-2 . DEF - Steven Taylor (NEWCASTLE vs Liverpool) - 7.5 . Craig Hope at St James' Park . No-nonsense defending throughout and kept Balotelli out of the game. Three wins from three since he came into side. Impressed alongside Janmaat, Fabricio Coloccini and Paul Dummett. Steven Taylor was an influential figure for Newcastle and has won all three games since returning to the side . DEF - Kieran Gibbs (ARSENAL vs Burnley) - 7 . Sami Mokbel at the Emirates Stadium . May not have been fully fit but the left-back showed no signs of that on Saturday. Calum Chambers may be credited with a goal and an assist but Gibbs was just as influential, bombing forward tirelessly against a dogged Burnley defence. Kieran Gibbs was a threat going forward against a tiring Burnley defence on Saturday . MID - Nemanja Matic (CHELSEA vs QPR) - 8 . Jack Gaughan at Stamford Bridge . Peerless, yet again. Isn’t handed the plaudits the flair players are for obvious reasons, but there isn’t a better midfielder ahead of a back four in the Premier League. Nemanja Matic is the new Claude Makelele for Chelsea and there is no better holding midfielder in England . MID - Moussa Sissoko (NEWCASTLE vs Liverpool) - 8.5 . Craig Hope at St James' Park . Menacing runs from deep asked questions of Reds and it was he who had major say in winning goal. Immense from first minute to last. A man of the match performance. Moussa Sissoko was a driving force for Newcastle in midfield was the man of the match . MID - Jonathan Walters (STOKE CITY vs West Ham) - 8 . Laurie Whitwell at the Britannia Stadium . Credited with the man of the match award as he combined persistent running with a cutting final ball on Saturday. Covered 10.8km from the wing against the Hammers. Jonathan Walters worked incredible hard for Stoke against West Ham . MID - Alexis Sanchez (ARSENAL vs Burnley) - 8.5 . Sami Mokbel at the Britannia Stadium . Again, it was down to Alexis Sanchez to save Arsenal. It is a story that is becoming all too familiar at the moment — when Arsenal are in a spot of bother, up pops Sanchez — but £30 million buys you a talented footballer who is the embodiment of a match-winner. Alexis Sanchez celebrates the second of his goals as Arsenal beat Burnley 3-0 . MID - Oscar (CHELSEA vs QPR) - 8.5 . Jack Gaughan at Stamford Bridge . Absolutely marvellous finish for the first goal, curling an effort with the outside of his foot beyond Rob Green from 18 yards. Gets better each week. Oscar scored this stunner to put Chelsea on their way against QPR on Saturday . FWD - Charlie Austin (QPR vs Chelsea) - 7.5 . Jack Gaughan at Stamford Bridge . Thankless task up there on his own. Tried his best to ruffle the feathers of Cahill and Terry and linked up nicely in spells. Excellently-improvised flicked finish for the equaliser. Charlie Austin did so well to work the Chelsea defence on Saturday and was rewarded with a goal .","Two Arsenal and two Chelsea players in our team of the day .

"Scott Arfield hopes Burnley can emulate Crystal Palace and recover from a poor start to retain their place in the Premier League. The Clarets have failed to win any of their opening nine games and have the worst record of any team in the top four flights of English football. Last season Palace lost nine of their first 10 games but a stunning revival over the second half of the season saw them finish 11th, 12 points clear of the bottom three. Scott Arfield celebrates Burnley's first goal of the season against Chelsea, the only time they have been ahead . Arfield has been one of his side's better performers, but Burnley are still yet to win a league game this season . Midfielder Arfield sees no reason why Burnley cannot turn their season around, saying: 'We saw that last season with the likes of Palace. We can take a lot of belief out of that and hopefully we can get that win and kick-start us. 'I don't think we've been too far away. Palace away and Sunderland at home were two in particular that we could have got the three points in each game. 'We were under no illusions how hard this season was going to be and it's just that elusive win. Hopefully we can get there. I think we've given a good account of ourselves over the duration of the games and that's the main aim. 'The mood in the camp is exactly the same as it was last year when we were winning. You want to win every game but there's a realism about that. The Burnley midfielder says Crystal Palace's turnaround last season has inspired their sqaud . Manager Sean Dyche and assistant Ian Woan look on as Burnley continue to search for three points . 'On a Saturday, when you go home you reflect on the game - did you do your best? - and I think everybody in the team can say that.' Arfield celebrates his 26th birthday on Saturday with a trip to the Emirates Stadium to face Arsenal. On paper, it is another daunting challenge, but Arsenal have not won at home in the league since the opening day of the season and needed a late equaliser to draw with Hull two weeks ago. Burnley have already drawn with Manchester United, and Arfield hopes being major underdogs can play into his side's hands. 'There are games that are not in your division,' he said. Burnley have conceded 16 goals in their first nine league games, and have scored only five times . Samuel Eto'o scores the first of his two goals against Burnley in last week's 3-1 win for Everton . 'There's a league within a league and then you go through certain games and think that's where you're going to pick up points. But it doesn't always happen like that and that's why you need to look at every game the same. 'When you go to Arsenal you need to stick to your game plan. We know how good they are and what quality they possess as a team and individually, but I think if we go there and stay compact and stay in the game then you never know what can happen.' One of the best moments of Burnley's season came via the boot of Arfield, who put them 1-0 up against Chelsea in the opening game at Turf Moor. Burnley will be up against quality in Arsenal on Saturday, with the likes of Aaron Ramsey and Alexis Sanchez . Crystal Palace picked up important points against top teams last season, and Burnley need to do the same . The Blues came back to win, and it remains the only time during the campaign so far that the Clarets have been ahead in a game. Arfield has looked one of the most likely sources for goal-shy Burnley, always willing to have a long-range shot with his powerful right foot, and he is desperate to add to his tally. 'It's one of the aspects that I'm dying to do,' he said. 'Last season I got nine and I was off this season in the first game. If the penalty goes in at Palace, I'd have been up to two already. 'You get fewer chances than you do in the Championship and when you get them you need to put them away. I think we've been a bit naive at times in front of goal.'","Burnley have picked up just four points in nine games .

"Defender Alex Bruce is desperate for Hull to get their own back on Southampton. The Saints did the double over the Tigers last season, easing to a 4-1 victory on home turf having already taken a 1-0 win at the KC Stadium. Saints return to East Yorkshire on Saturday on the crest of a wave, lying second in the Barclays Premier League and having won nine of their last 10 matches in all competitions. But Bruce believes his side have all the motivation they need to end that productive streak. Alex Bruce wants Hull to get one over Southampton after two defeats last season . 'They were a bit of a bogey team for us last year,' said Bruce. 'They played very well here and at St Mary's. Hopefully we can put that right with a win. 'We have to approach it in the right way because we owe them one as it stands. 'They've hit the ground running this season but hopefully we can stop them in their tracks.' Southampton's Jose Fonte celebrates with team-mates after scoring against Hull last season . Assistant manager Steve Agnew, meanwhile, insisted Tom Ince has a big role to play at Hull. He joined the club with high hopes this summer, having been linked with Inter Milan, but has featured just three times in the league and was absent from several matchday squads before leaving on loan for Nottingham Forest this week. But Agnew insists that is not the beginning of the end for the England Under-21 international. 'Tom came in pre-season and did ever so well then started the season with us,' he said. Rickie Lambert scored when Southampton beat Hull at St Mary's . 'We changed the shape of the team and then one or two players in or out and Tom was one of those. 'We felt he hasn't played as much football as we would have liked so Steve agreed with Nottingham Forest to take him on loan until January. 'Hopefully he'll get some games in, perform like we know he can and it will be beneficial to all of us. 'He is a top player, an exciting player and one we're looking forward to working with for a good number of years.'","Southamton beat Hull 4-1 at St Mary's and 1-0 at the KC Stadium .

"Tom Huddlestone is in his prime footballing years and has plenty of time left on the field - yet the Hull City midfielder is already plotting his future. The 27-year-old is desperate to move into management once he hangs up his boots and has started work early on achieving his coaching badges. Having previously completed his UEFA B coaching licence in the summer, Huddlestone is already more than halfway towards securing the A badge. Tom Huddlestone (right) has already completed his UEFA B coaching licence and is halfway to the A badge . The Hull City midfielder is determined to achieve his badges before he hangs up his playing boots . Quoted in the Daily Star, the former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder said: 'Hopefully I've still got a few years left playing but it's better to have it. 'It's (coaching) something I would like to do in the future and I didn't have much planned in the summer, so it was ideal to get it started. 'It's easier to get the badges while you're still playing, rather than be out of the game for four or five years and suddenly decide you want to get them because a few of your ideas might have been lost. The 27-year-old is determined he has 'a few years left playing' yet but wants to plan for the future . 'While you still have fresh ideas and ways of playing, I think it's a good idea to get them done.' Huddlestone, who began his career at Derby County and also spent a season on loan at Wolverhampton Wanderers, has represented England at every level from Under 16 through to the senior squad. He has not made an England appearance since 2012, however. The Nottingham-born midfielder has made 369 career club appearances, scoring 20 times. Huddlestone was booked during Hull City's 0-0 draw against Liverpool at Anfield last weekend .","Tom Huddlestone has completed his UEFA B coaching licence already .

Sadio Mane could return to the Southampton squad as Saints look to maintain their impressive run of form at Hull. Mane was rested as a precaution against Stoke in the Capital One Cup on Wednesday night. The midfielder was expected to train on Friday in the hope that he will be included in the squad that travels to East Yorkshire. Saints manager Ronald Koeman, whose team have won six of their last seven Barclays Premier League matches, otherwise has a full squad to select from.

Southampton have won their last four league games against Hull and lost just one of the last 16 in all comps (W10 D5 L1), incl. a meeting in the Full Members Cup in 1986/87. Southampton have won six of their opening nine games to a top-flight season for the first time in their history. Ronald Koeman’s side have conceded just five league goals this season; fewer than any other team in England’s top four divisions.

"Alan Irvine has revealed Leonardo Ulloa was on his West Brom wishlist as he prepares to try to silence the striker. The head coach admits he was tracking the Argentinian before he made an £8million summer move from Brighton to Leicester. Irvine instead signed Brown Ideye for a club record £10million from Dynamo Kiev but the Nigeria international has struggled for form and fitness. Leicester City signed Leonardo Ulloa from Brighton in the summer for £8million . West Brom head coach Alan Irvine revealed that the Baggies wanted to sign the tall front man . He has just one goal - in the Capital One Cup - compared to Ulloa's five in the Barclays Premier League. The Baggies face Ulloa and Leicester at the King Power Stadium on Saturday and Irvine has revealed he was interested in bringing him to the Hawthorns. He said: 'He was a player that was on a great big list in the recruitment room. Mervyn Day, who is our head scout, was at Brighton so he knows him really well. 'We talked about him and looked at him and made enquiries about him but we didn't make an offer. 'He was a player who was definitely being considered but Leicester jumped in very quickly. Time will tell who ends up being the best buy. 'From our point of view we hope Brown ends up being a great signing for us. 'Whether Ulloa turns out to be one for Leicester I'm not really too interested in - it's ours that are my focus. 'You just want them to do a great job for us and if they do that we will be delighted - then it is okay for someone else's players to do well for them too.' Ideye is fit after an ankle problem and played in Albion's 2-1 Capital One Cup defeat to Bournemouth on Tuesday. West Brom instead opted to sign Ideye Brown (centre) for a club record fee but he has struggled with injuries . And Irvine hopes the 26-year-old can finally kickstart his Baggies career. 'It was good for him to get a start. He needed that and hopefully it will do him a lot of good,' he said. 'It's been frustrating for him and the same for us. 'Having scored his first goal he got injured scoring it and that was a real shame as everyone has seen plenty of times in the past a striker scores a goal and suddenly he can't stop scoring.' Saido Berahino's eight goals have grabbed the headlines and eased the pressure on Ideye and Irvine feels Berahino's form has allowed Ideye to develop away from the spotlight. 'Yes, absolutely it has given him that little bit more time to get fit, first of all,' he said. 'It's given him the opportunity as well to get to know people and get more settled in the area. 'I hate to think how I would have managed going to Ukraine. It can't be easy. And for a Nigerian to come from Ukraine to England it is a big life change.'","West Brom head coach Alan Irvine wanted to sign Leonardo Ulloa .

Cesc Fabregas has been involved in nine goals (one goal, eight assists) in nine league games for Chelsea. Queens Park Rangers have won just one of their last 18 away trips to rival London clubs in the Premier League (D3 L14). Harry Redknapp has lost just one of his last six Premier League clashes with Chelsea (W2 D3). Shaun Wright-Phillips (third right) stunned former club Chelsea when he scored the only goal in a 1-0 victory for QPR the last time the teams met at Stamford Bridge in January last year . However, he has seen his teams lose all five league clashes with Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea. In their last 12 league matches at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea have kept 10 clean sheets and conceded just four goals in total. The last time a side in the Premier League relegation zone went to the home of the league leaders and won was September 2001 (Southampton beating Sam Allardyce’s Bolton 1-0). Since then, the league leaders have won 24 of their 26 home matches against a side in the relegation zone (D2). Charlie Austin has scored 23 league goals for QPR since the beginning of last season (incl. play-offs); 17 more than any other player (Ravel Morrison – 6). Steven Caulker is the only QPR player to have started every league game so far this season.

When the likes of Dejan Lovren, Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert, Luke Shaw and Calum Chambers all left during the summer, the doom-mongers gathered to predict tough times ahead for Koeman. However, the Dutchman thinks being able to stamp his mark on the team from the off has contributed to Saints' flying start to the campaign. 'It helped, although (Dusan) Tadic was already on the scouting list at Southampton,' said Koeman. 'It also came down to positions. Lallana left, so we have to bring in a similar player to Lallana. Lambert goes, so we have to bring in another striker. Spending the money in the positions that we needed was the most important thing. 'But what happened is not normal. Normally you would have to change one or two new players, instead of six or seven players. But this way it is more my team as I have my own players rather than what was left by the other manager. 'Good players, good quality players, can adapt, although it usually takes some time. This team looks like it has already been together for two seasons. But that is down to the players because they are good players.' The Dutchman revealed that star playmaker Dusan Tadic was already being scouted by Southampton . Graziano Pelle (C) has been one of the finds of the season after replacing Rickie Lambert up front . Asked if he thought Southampton could maintain their momentum and realistically challenge for a top-four place this season, Koeman replied: 'We can keep this, I'm not afraid about the situation. 'If I look at the rest of the teams, I don't think a lot of them are better than Southampton. 'I think we have gone under the radar. Maybe some people are very surprised but from the start of the season I saw what I had and I had belief, belief in the players and their spirit. 'Okay, maybe not to be second in the league at this moment, but we have good players and we play good football and everybody enjoys how we play. This is very important.' It is not only in the league that Southampton have excelled this season. Saints won at Stoke in midweek to reach the quarter-finals of the Capital One Cup, where they will face Sheffield United. This graphic shows how much the Saints have improved in attack and defence this season . While Koeman accepts being paired against the Sky Bet League One side gives his team an excellent chance to progress, the Dutchman is not getting carried away by thoughts of Wembley just yet. He said: 'I think it is a good draw because I think it can be worse, maybe Chelsea, Tottenham, Liverpool away. 'You have to be lucky about the draw in a cup. Again it is an away game, that's a pity, but it is a good chance to reach the semi-finals. 'We are doing a good job in the Capital One Cup, we have played three matches away and we have three wins, we have to keep that up in the next game.' 'But it is too early (to start thinking about Wembley), maybe if we reach the semi-final when it is more clear, then it is more realistic.' Another new signing Saido Mane (L) is expected to return against Hull after sitting out of the League Cup win . Sadio Mane could return to the Southampton squad at Hull. Mane was rested as a precaution against Stoke on Wednesday night. The midfielder was expected to train on Friday in the hope that he will be included in the squad that travels to East Yorkshire. Koeman, whose team have won six of their last seven Premier League matches, otherwise has a full squad to select from.","Southampton are second in the Premier League table after a storming start .

"HANDS OFF IN THE BOX is our new campaign to rid football of the dark arts of the penalty box. Whether it is wrestling, grappling, shirt pulling - or the outrageous headlocks witnessed in the Manchester United vs Chelsea match - the area has become a free-for-all for cheating. And that means fewer goals in the Barclays Premier League. For too long, referees have failed to punish players for blatantly stopping opponents from scoring. It's time to end that. So join us in our campaign to say Hands Off In The Box to players and referees. We’ll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it. Barclays Premier League penalty boxes are starting to look more like WWE wrestling rings as defenders blatantly cheat to stop attackers scoring goals from set pieces. Sunday's clash of the titans at Old Trafford produced the most outrageous example yet seen. Marcos Rojo took John Terry in a headlock while Chris Smalling did the same to Branislav Ivanovic before dragging him to the ground. Both Manchester United defenders went unpunished. But this is by no means an isolated incident and Sportsmail has launched a new campaign  to rid football of the dark arts in the penalty area. Referees and assistants need to toughen up - they can see these fouls but choose not to punish them because they do not want to give away multiple penalties per match. But that is not good enough. Bodychecking and wrestling inside the box must be stamped out, just as tackles from behind have been and reckless challenges are being now. Guilty defenders must be named and shamed - if everyone knows who the cheats are, referees will have no excuse not to punish serial offenders. So, here is a rogues gallery nominated by Sportsmail's experts. The players below are those who we consider the worst offenders in the game. But unfortunately they are still just the tip of the iceberg. Nominate YOUR prime suspects by using the comments section below... Branislav Ivanovic and Chris Smalling wrestle in the box during Manchester United's draw with Chelsea . But that was not the only incident at the same set piece, with John Terry and Marcos Rojo also grappling (right) RYAN SHAWCROSS (Stoke City) No player has conceded more penalties in the Premier League in the past five years. As good and decent as he is, the Stoke defender is one of the worst offenders. He’s being targeted by officials now and was correctly punished when he held Swansea striker Wilfried Bony at a corner. Neil Ashton . Stoke's Ryan Shawcross (right) did concede a penalty for this grapple with Swansea's Wilfried Bony last week . MARTIN SKRTEL (Liverpool) I would say the Liverpool defender has turned this in to an art form if he wasn’t so bad at it. Ian Ladyman . Liverpool's Martin Skrtel has also been penalised in the past for penalty area blocking . VINCENT KOMPANY (Manchester City) Arguably the finest defender in the Premier League after John Terry, Kompany is a brute. He operates on the edge – just ask Fernando Torres, who the Belgian ‘monstered’ in the 2013 FA Cup semi-final (below). Watch him as City defend their next corner, he’ll be all over his man. Mark Alford . Vincent Kompany nearly tears the shirt off Fernando Torres during the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley in 2013 . MARTIN SKRTEL (Liverpool) I wouldn't say he is the worst in the Premier League but it does not go unnoticed how often Liverpool's Slovakian central defender grapples with opponents at set pieces. There's nothing wrong with being combative but one of these days Skrtel may find himself being penalised. Dominic King . MARTIN SKRTEL (Liverpool) Always felt he and Daniel Agger got away with a lot at Liverpool. With Agger gone, Skrtel is the standard bearer. Riath Al-Samarrai . Skrtel (second left) grabs hold of Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker's shirt at a set piece in February . JOHN TERRY (Chelsea) The Chelsea captain will do just about anything to clear his lines and make it hard for the opposition and this often means resorting to the dark arts. But you don’t become the Premier League’s best defender without working out how to get away with it. Brian Lee . John Terry (second left) wrestles with Marcos Rojo during Sunday's clash at Old Trafford . MILE JEDINAK (Crystal Palace) Mike Dean rightly awarded a spot-kick when the Palace captain rugby-tackled Burnley’s Lukas Jutkiewicz to the floor last month. Julian Speroni spared his blushes with a fine penalty save that day but Jedinak is a serial offender. Joe Ridge . MAROUANE FELLAINI (Manchester United) Cynical defending was about the only thing Fellaini contributed to United's cause during his first year at Old Trafford. Let's have more spectacular goals like the strike at West Brom last week rather than all that ugly shirt-pulling, please. Chris Cutmore . Marouane Fellaini (centre right) uses his arm to challenge Newcastle's Luuk de Jong last season . MARTIN SKRTEL (Liverpool) He is all about the physical side of the game but takes it too far defending corners and free kicks. Skrtel barely ever looks at the ball and rarely does he not have a chunk of his opponent's shirt in his hand. He's been doing it week-in-week-out since he joined the Premier League in 2008. Sam Cunningham . Hull goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic attempts to catch the ball while Skrtel uses his arms to try and stop him . STEVEN TAYLOR (Newcastle) The physical defender gives as good as he gets in the box, and then some. Taylor loves blocking in the area in every sense of the word, including Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic's eyeline in 2013. Kieran Gill . WES MORGAN (Leicester City) Not the quickest over five yards, Morgan gains an advantage when defending corners by blocking off from set pieces. More of a wrestler than shirt-puller, the Leicester captain consistently gets away with impeding strikers unfairly, often grasping an opponent’s upper arm to haul them back. Jack Gaughan . Branislav Ivanovic (Chelsea) The defender got a taste of his own medicine at the weekend. Ivanovic may be playing the victim right now but he’s mastered the dark arts of defending. Just look at the picture below. Rajvir Rai . Mertesacker (yes, him again) has his shorts tugged by Ivanovic during a corner at Stamford Bridge in October - and fellow Chelsea defender Gary Cahill (left) grabs hold of the German's torso for good measure . JOHN TERRY (Chelsea) One of the main offenders for the last decade or so, John Terry loves a tug on an opponent's shirt. Grappling for space in the area ready to 'defend' a set-piece, the Chelsea centre back has long evaded punishment for being heavy-handed in the penalty box. Elliott Bretland . MAROUANE CHAMAKH (Crystal Palace) When the Moroccan arrived at Arsenal he was notable as much for his ‘defending’ at corners as his (limited) goal-threat. Since working under Tony Pulis and now Neil Warnock at Palace, his proficiency at the dark arts has only increased. Rarely seen at a set piece without a handful of shirt. Jonny Singer . Mesut Ozil tries to escape the clutches of Crystal Palace forward Marouane Chamakh (right) John Terry, Chelsea captain . ‘Me and Branislav Ivanovic were double headlocked at every corner.’ Colin Pascoe, Liverpool assistant manager . ‘Grappling. That is the new word is it? It is the referees’ interpretation and we’ll leave it to them. That’s what the referees and the officials are paid for. They make decisions. So whatever they decide is grappling, or holding, it’s in their hands really. Did I do it as player? No, I was a winger and didn’t have to mark anyone.’ Ian Wright, Ex-Arsenal striker . ‘There should be an official specifically looking for holding in the box from set-pieces. It was like UFC in the United area.’ Graham Poll, Former top referee . ‘Hold or grapple and you can expect to be cautioned. Once fans, managers and — crucially — players accept it as normal, this campaign will have achieved its aims.’ Martin Keown, Ex-Arsenal defender . ‘Defenders are checking, blocking, holding, grappling, using force to foul opponents — and too often referees are allowing it to take place.’ Micky Mellon, Shrewsbury Town manager . ‘In a congested area how can you judge if someone’s been blocked? It’s part of the game and some people are good at it. It’s football. A local Football League referee came in and he was asking me about it. “Can you show me some blocking techniques?” That was great, he was trying to find ways of detecting it. The confusing thing for managers is that fouls outside the area are given as free-kicks, but the same won’t be given as penalties. There has to be consistency.’ And the readers of MailOnline... ‘It’s more infuriating because we never hear from the refs themselves. It’s about time the refs were made to answer the media just like players.’ Willdajack, Neath . ‘To those saying if there was a clampdown every game would be littered with penalties, that would be true for a couple of weeks then it would stop. I’ve been watching football since the Sixties and the cheating behaviour in the penalty area now is the worst I’ve ever seen.’ Sir Miles Platting, Manchester .

"Gus Poyet wants a witch to cast a spell on injury-plagued Steven Fletcher after revealing his fears that the Sunderland striker was set for another lengthy spell on the sidelines. The Scotland international has been passed fit for Monday's trip to Crystal Palace despite worries that he had broken a metatarsal. Fletcher – who has suffered similar injuries before – limped out of the 2-0 defeat at home to Arsenal last weekend after a stamp on his foot. Sunderland staff feared Steven Fletcher (left) has broken a bone in his foot but he is fit to face Crystal Palace . Black Cats boss Gus Poyet joked that he needs a witch's spell to keep Fletcher fit after a series of injuries . Fletcher and his team-mates train at the Academy of Light on Friday ahead of Monday's game against Palace . Poyet was immediately warned by his medical team that his two-goal top scorer could have suffered serious damage. But there was positive news on Friday as the Black Cats boss confirmed that Fletcher was okay, although he would welcome the intervention of an injury-preventing potion. 'I need a witch,' said Poyet. 'I need someone to come here and throw something on him. 'I feared he had broken his metatarsal. That was a shout. The doctor said to me it could be that because of the pain he had and where it was. 'Lucky enough it was not, which is great. He has had two or three days' rest with the bruising and has trained without any problems now.

Midfielder Jack Rodwell grins during training as Sunderland prepare to face Neil Warnock's side . 'So I am really looking forward to seeing him on the pitch on Monday.' Meanwhile, Poyet says that Danny Graham's Sunderland career is not over, despite a loan move to Brentford collapsing earlier this week. The 29-year-old striker – who signed for £5million from Swansea in January, 2013 – has only made 13 league appearances for the club and is yet to score. And Poyet believes it is now up to Graham to determine how his season plays out. 'I think he has been close,' said the Uruguayan. 'But it depends on the characteristics of the team. If you use the wingers well they can put balls in and give you a chance 'I don't think we've been doing that whatsoever so we have needed a different proposition, but it's up to him every day.

"Ahead of this weekend's Premier League action, Sportsmail will be providing you with all you need to know about every fixture, with team news, provisional squads, betting odds and Opta stats. Here is all the information you need for Stoke's home clash with West Ham... Stoke City vs West Ham United (Britannia Stadium) Kick-off: Saturday 3pm . Odds (subject to change): . Stoke 5/4 . Draw 12/5 . West Ham 21/10 . Referee: Chris Foy . Managers: Mark Hughes (Stoke), Sam Allardyce (West Ham) Head-to-head league record: Stoke wins 58, draws 33, West Ham wins 39 . Team news . Stoke . Stoke will be without suspended duo Peter Crouch and Phil Bardsley for Saturday's visit of in-form West Ham. Striker Crouch was sent off for the first time in Stoke colours in Wednesday's Capital One Cup loss to Southampton and full-back Bardsley picked up his fifth yellow card of the season in the same game. Marc Muniesa is a doubt after going over on his ankle in training while fellow defender Robert Huth (calf), midfielder Glenn Whelan (broken leg) and striker Peter Odemwingie (knee) are all sidelined. Provisional squad: Begovic, Sorensen, Wilson, Shawcross, Pieters, Cameron, Muniesa, Nzonzi, Adam, Sidwell, Ireland, Walters, Arnautovic, Bojan, Assaidi, Moses, Diouf. Peter Crouch will be suspended for the visit of West Ham after being sent off in midweek . West Ham . Diafra Sakho will be assessed as late as Saturday morning as Sam Allardyce gives the West Ham striker as much time as possible to prove his fitness for their game at Stoke. The in-form forward injured a shoulder in the 2-1 win over Manchester City last week and it remains to be seen if he is risked at the Britannia Stadium despite scoring six goals in as many Barclays Premier League starts. James Tomkins and Matt Jarvis return to the squad after both recovered from thigh injuries but Guy Demel remains sidelined with Mauro Zarate (thigh) a doubt and Andy Carroll not in contention despite returning to training following ankle surgery. Provisional squad: Adrian, Jaaskelainen, Cresswell, O'Brien, Reid, Tomkins, Collins, Jenkinson, Noble, Kouyate, Song, Poyet, Nolan, Amalfitano, Downing, Jarvis, Vaz Te, Cole, Zarate, Sakho, Valencia. Diafra Sakho celebrates putting West Ham 2-0 ahead in their victory over Manchester City . Key match stats (supplied by Opta) Stoke have won eight of their last 12 Premier League home games (L3 D1). West Ham have now scored in eight successive Premier League games; their best run in the competition since Nov 2009 (10 games). Diafra Sakho became only the second player in Premier League history to score in his first six starts in the competition thanks to his goal versus Man City (after Mick Quinn). No-one has ever scored in their first seven. Stoke City have allowed their opponents fewer shots on target than any other side in the Premier League (22). Despite going 1-0 down, Stoke came back to win 3-1 against West Ham at the Britannia Stadium  in March with Peter Odemwingie (right) celebrating the Potters' third goal with team-mate Stephen Ireland . West Ham are seven points better off compared to their equivalent matches against the same opposition from last season; the best such record in the Premier League. Just six goals have been scored at the Britannia Stadium so far this season, fewer than any other Premier League ground. Mark Arnautovic is yet to hit the target with any of his 11 shots in the Premier League this season (incl. blocked). If he features, Carlton Cole will play his 200th Premier League game for West Ham. Only two players Steve Potts (204) and Mark Noble (201 currently) have featured more. Only Paolo Di Canio (47) has scored more Premier League goals for West Ham than Cole (41). The Hammers squad have had 35 headed shots in the Premier League so far this season, 17 more than any other team (Sunderland, Chelsea and QPR all on 18). They have scored seven headed goals; a league high.","Stoke duo Peter Crouch and Phil Bardsley suspended for  West Ham game .

"Gus Poyet says his team must handle the pressure of playing in front of a national TV audience at Crystal Palace on Monday night. The Black Cats have slumped into the bottom three following their 8-0 drubbing at Southampton and 2-0 defeat at home to Arsenal. And they now face trial by television at Selhurst Park. John O'Shea trains with his Sunderland team-mates ahead of Monday's game at Crystal Palace . ‘No-one will relax because no-one wants to be on TV doing bad things,’ he said. ‘But if you don’t have the character to go and play on TV at Palace then you shouldn't be in the Premier League. ‘It will be noisy. That is the atmosphere they like to create. But it is 11 v 11. It's a great game for us.' Sunderland manager Gus Poyet  talks to his players during training . Poyet, meanwhile, insists he will not shy away from dropping those who have under-performed of late, but will resist radical change. ‘There are decisions to make, which I'm not afraid of,’ he said. ‘That’s why I do the job, I like those big decisions. Poyet has told his players they must show character when they face Palace on Monday night . ‘But I don’t think it’s time to be too clever and change the shape or anything. It is one game, the Southampton game killed us. ‘I’m not going to cry, I’m going to keep trying and keep working. ‘When you’re on a bad run it is difficult to turn it around.

"Stoke manager Mark Hughes feels the Football Association's decision not to charge Garry Monk could have set a dangerous precedent. Swansea boss Monk was asked to explain his comments after calling Stoke winger Victor Moses a cheat for going down under a challenge from Angel Rangel that earned the Potters a penalty in their 2-1 Barclays Premier League victory earlier this month. TV pundit John Hartson apologised for echoing Monk's sentiments but the Swans manager stood by his comments and the FA this week decided to take no further action. Stoke boss Mark Hughes believes the FA have set an unwelcome precedent after not charging Garry Monk . Monk called Victor Moses a cheat after he went down to win a penalty in Stoke's win against Swansea . Swansea boss Monk, pictured on the touchline against Leicester, was not punished for his comments . Asked if it had set an unwelcome precedent, Hughes said: 'I think it may well have done. Maybe that word is allowed to be used by ourselves. It seems to be that the FA's vindicated what was said.' Earlier in the same game, Swansea were awarded a penalty by referee Michael Oliver after Ryan Shawcross tussled with Wilfried Bony in the box. The issue has become a major talking point and Stoke are angry that Shawcross has been singled out as the most high-profile offender. Hughes has even relieved his captain of marking duties at set-pieces because of concerns referees are looking to punish him. The Stoke manager said: 'We are speaking to people we feel have got an influence and need to be told our feelings about the situation, because we feel quite strongly. That's ongoing. 'Sometimes you've got to get the message across that we're not going to stand for it and we think it's unfair. I'm sure Ryan will be fine but, if it goes on any longer, then it's detrimental to any player. We need to stop it.' Stoke's Ryan Shawcross (right) gave away a penalty for grappling with Wilfried Bony (second from right) Shawcross was at it again in the Capital One Cup when he held onto Southampton's Graziano Pelle (centre) Hughes does not feel the standard of refereeing in general is where it needs to be and thinks one improvement would be for potential issues from each game to be looked at straight away. He said: 'My view is the whole game needs to be reviewed by the referee and his team immediately after a game rather than waiting a couple of days to see what media outcry there is and then someone who wasn't even at the game is asked to see whether decisions are right or wrong.' He then added, in a dig at Mark Clattenburg following his ban this week: 'Sometimes they've got pop concerts to go to so maybe that's the reason they don't want to do that.' Stoke are looking to get back to winning ways against West Ham on Saturday following back-to-back defeats by Southampton in league and cup. While Saints are the form team of the Premier League, West Ham are not far behind with three successive wins, including over Manchester City last weekend. 'They're doing very well, playing exceptionally well,' said Hughes. 'They've changed their way of playing somewhat but don't underestimate, they still have plan A and plan B; if they feel they need to go long, they will do. Hughes was not impressed with referee Mark Clattenburg's decision to attend an Ed Sheeran concert . 'It's not a bad option, obviously we use it as well so it's not something to make apologies about. It works at the right time. 'They've got good pace up front. The lads they've brought in have made an immediate impact, scored goals. It's gone really well for them and they're playing with a lot of confidence.' Stoke will try to succeed where the Hammers' last seven opponents have failed in stopping Diafra Sakho from scoring. The summer signing from Metz has been a revelation and already more than justified his reported fee of £3.5million. Stoke will attempt to stop West Ham's in-form striker Diafra Sakho at the Britannia Stadium on Saturday . Hughes said of Sakho: 'He has done really well. I didn't know a great deal about him, and they're always a risk. 'Until you bring them to the league, you're never quite sure how they're going to deal with the physicality of the Premier League, but credit to him, he's done exceptionally well. He's a real threat and I've been very impressed with him.' Stoke will be without suspended duo Phil Bardsley and Peter Crouch, who Hughes revealed has apologised following his sending off against Southampton in midweek.","Garry Monk called Stoke winger Victor Moses a cheat after the winger won a penalty against his side .

Key match stats (supplied by Opta) Romelu Lukaku has scored in three of his five Premier League appearances against Swansea. Swansea beat Everton 3-0 earlier this season in the League Cup which was their first win against the Toffees in any competition after 15 defeats and five draws. Everton have never lost to Swansea City in the league (18 games). This is the most league games between two teams without any defeat ever by one team against another in the top four tiers of English league football. Ross Barkley scored the winning goal in each of last season’s two league games between Everton and Swansea City. Swansea recorded their first ever victory over Everton this season when they won 3-0 in the Capital One Cup. Here, Toffees' James McCarthy battles with Ki Sung-yueng at Liberty Stadium as Bafetimbi Gomis looks on . Wilfried Bony has now scored 20 Premier League goals for Swansea City – the joint most for the Swans in the competition alongside Michu. The Toffees have won 199 home games in Premier League history. Swansea City have used just 18 players this season, fewer than any other team in the Premier League. Roberto Martinez’s men are so far the most accurate shooters in the top flight this season, hitting the target with 54 per cent of efforts. The Toffees have scored a joint league-high four goals from outside the area (alongside West Ham). Conversely, Swansea are one of four sides yet to concede a goal from outside the box in the Premier League this season.

"Alan Irvine admits he is worried about the spotlight on Saido Berahino and insisted he is keeping a close eye on the West Brom star. The Baggies boss is cautious about the pressure placed on the striker after his dream start to the season. Berahino is the club's eight-goal top scorer and is the top English marksman in the Barclays Premier League. Saido Berahino has been in excellent form this season, scoring eight goals for West Brom . The Under 21 international is also tipped for a senior call-up next month but Irvine wants to protect his player. 'So far he is coping well but it does worry me as it's a lot to ask of a young player,' he said. 'The big thing for him is that, in order to maximise the potential, he has got to train the way he has been training, live life as he has been living life and then hopefully put in the performances he has been so far. Alan Irvine said that he worries about the pressure and attention Berahino will be exposed to . 'That is difficult enough without all of the added attention he has been getting but so far he is handling it very well.' The Baggies go to Leicester in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday after being dumped out of the Capital One Cup by Bournemouth on Tuesday. They drew 2-2 with Crystal Palace in their last top flight game when Berahino scored a last-minute penalty to level. Irvine was assistant manager at Everton when Wayne Rooney broke into the side as a 16-year-old and the Scot believes Berahino can handle the spotlight in the same way as the England skipper. Irvine said that, apart from his short fuse, Berahino should look to copy Wayne Rooney's example . He said: 'Wayne was extremely mature as far as all that is concerned. He had a short fuse but has got better at managing that. 'Other than that Wayne had no problems mentally, he was unbelievably strong and loved playing football. 'We had no concerns and we tried to teach him how he needed to be. 'I'm not seeing Saido being a problem, the biggest thing is we support him as coaches and everyone provides him with as much support as possible.'","Saido Berahino is West Brom's top scorer this season .

But a raft of summer arrivals including seven-goal Diafra Sakho, Alex Song, Enner Valencia and Cheikhou Kouyate have so far quashed fears of another season battling relegation. However, Allardyce has fired a warning shot to his players, saying: ‘It’s not difficult for me (to ignore the praise) but sometimes the players find it a bit difficult. ‘I said to the players don’t start reading about yourself too much or else we’ ll have to start changing the size of the doors to get their heads through. ‘So keep your feet on the ground and don’t read too much praise about yourself like you shouldn’t read too much of the criticism. Alex Song produced a commanding performance in West Ham's midfield as they beat Manchester City . ‘You play it for the enjoyment and the praise that you get but make sure you manage it and control it well. ‘We have got to maintain it and our levels of performance. That is my responsibility because we have not been tested like this before and it’s about whether we can sustain this success. ‘Even last year when we had our darkest moments and we came out of it and won four on the trot and then lost four on the trot. ‘We have got to find that level of sustainability and consistency in our levels of results and performances. They have got to find out and I have got to find out if we are capable of that.’ Sakho will be given until Saturday morning to prove his fitness to Sam Allardyce ahead of the Stoke clash . Allardyce added: ‘As a manager, sustainable progress is what it’s all about. ‘You can be too slow and lose your job and then too quick and falter and then lose your job. If you build slowly and steadily and success is improved year in, year out then you can eventually get to stage where West Ham becomes like an Everton is at the moment. ‘That’s not only sustainability but looking at cup competitions and winning a trophy and getting into Europe and that can happen in this season and in the next two or three years perhaps depending upon the investment and the improvement of the squad.’","Sam Allardyce's men currently sit fourth in the Barclays Premier League .

"West Ham United manager Sam Allardyce says he is prepared to rest his new foreign stars during the busy Christmas period to protect them from burnout. The likes of Enner Valencia, Diafra Sakho and Cheikhou Kouyate have had a major influence this season, helping the club to fourth in the Barclays Premier League.

And Allardyce is ready to risk upsetting fans after admitting he is willing to take his new stars out of the firing line. ‘When you come to November and December and get injuries - even though they might not be out as long they miss more games because they come so thick and fast,’ said Allardyce. ‘If players are out around Christmas they can miss six or seven games. Sakho will be given until Saturday morning to prove his fitness to Sam Allardyce ahead of the Stoke clash . ‘New players - Enner Valencia, Sakho, Kouyate and Mauro Zarate - won’t have hit that cauldron of mental and physical output during that particular period. Those players normally have a break. ‘Sir Alex Ferguson used to send players like Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani away at Christmas. He gave them a rest and then brought them back in and they kick on. I know what I’m doing.’ Meanwhile, Allardyce will make a late decision on the fitness of Sakho, who is suffering with a shoulder injury, ahead of Saturday's clash against Stoke.

"Jordan Rossiter grabbed the winner as Liverpool beat Tottenham in the Under 21 Premier League on Friday night. The 17-year-old midfielder, who has featured in Brendan Rodgers' first-team squad for Capital One Cup matches this season, struck early in the second half to halt a run of three straight defeats. Ryan Kent had given Liverpool the lead at Langtree Park in St Helens, only for Will Miller to equalise for Spurs shortly before the break.

Scorer: Miller 40 . Tottenham, coached by former England defender Ugo Ehiogu, were the pre-match favourites on form, having beaten Chelsea on Monday night. But it was Liverpool who started the more positively, almost opening the scoring inside the first minute when Jerome Sinclair saw his curling shot come back off the post after Jordan Williams had played him in. The hosts received a scare when Miller fired just over the bar but continued to press and Harry Wilson missed his kick with the goal beckoning after Spurs goalkeeper Tom Glover had misjudged a cross. Glover atoned a minute later when he turned Kent's powerful shot over the bar but the Liverpool winger wasn't to be denied on 27 minutes. After winning a free-kick on the edge of the box, Kent dusted himself down to fire the ball past Glover's reach and give Liverpool a deserved lead.

"Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger insists the fighting instincts shared by Alexis Sanchez and Luis Suarez were honed on the streets of South America. Wenger admires the energy and devilry of Chile international Sanchez, the Gunners' £35million summer signing from Barcelona, and Uruguay striker Suarez. The Frenchman believes the dominance of Latin American forwards in European football is a result of the determination needed to succeed in their homelands, while developed countries have become 'softer'. Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez has a fighting spirit that the Gunners have been missing in recent seasons . Barcelona's new striker Luis Suarez is also renowned for his bullish attitude on the field of play . Arsene Wenger believes the pair are special because of their childhood root on the streets of South America . 'Look across Europe and where are the strikers from? Many of them, at least 80 per cent, are from South America,' Wenger said. 'Maybe it's because in Europe street football has gone. In street football when you're 10-years-old, you want to play with 15-year-olds. 'Then you have to prove you're good, you have to fight and win impossible balls. 'When it's all a bit more formalised, it's less about developing your individual skill and fighting attitude. We've lost that a bit. 'Not every South American has that, but if you go back 30 or 40 years in England, life was tougher. 'Society has changed. We're much more protective than we were 20 or 30 years ago. We have all become a bit softer.' Suarez - pictured battling with Stoke's Ryan Shawcross in January - gave Liverpool an added edge . Sanchez has scored eight goals in 15 appearances since joining Arsenal and Wenger has been impressed with his rapid transition to the Barclays Premier League. 'I'm a bit surprised. It's because he has a particular mental strength,' Wenger said. 'He reminds me of the first generation of English players that I had - Lee Dixon, Steve Bould, Tony Adams, Nigel Winterburn, Martin Keown. This kind who is just ready for the fight. 'It's natural to Alexis. Every day he wants the ball. He doesn't walk out, he runs out. Sanchez - who starred for Chile at last summer's World Cup in Brazil - has made an impact at the Emirates . 'He has a natural level of energy that is unbelievable. You would love everyone to have that, but unfortunately it doesn't work like that. 'When you see where he has come from, where he was born, and then he plays for Barcelona and Arsenal, he needs to have something special.' When asked if Sanchez and Suarez were alike, Wenger replied: 'Exactly. When Suarez gives the ball to an opponent, he wins it back straight away. 'Sanchez is the same, there is no time between the offence and defence. The transition is very quick. And they are very quick as well.'","Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger lauds the spirit of Alexis Sanchez .

"Barcelona coach Luis Enrique has backed Luis Suarez after the Uruguay forward came in for criticism for his performance in last weekend's 'Clasico' defeat at Real Madrid. Suarez made his official debut for Barca in the 3-1 reverse at the Bernabeu after his four-month ban for biting an opponent expired the day before, but made little impact and was replaced midway through the second half. Although he was involved in Neymar's opening goal and almost set up Lionel Messi to score, it was generally agreed that Suarez lacked sharpness and he was well marshalled by Real centre backs Sergio Ramos and Pepe. Luis Suarez made his Barcelona debut against Real Madrid in El Clasico last week, but has been criticised . Barca boss Luis Enrique has defended his new striker, and the decision to start playing him immediately . Some questioned Luis Enrique's decision to include Suarez in the starting lineup but the former Spain and Barca midfielder, who also had a stint at Real, insisted the 27-year-old was close to peak fitness. 'He is in very good shape, training at the same rhythm as his team mates,' Luis Enrique told a news conference previewing Saturday's La Liga game at home to Celta Vigo. 'He is a great boost to the squad,' he added. 'We thought that back in the summer when we decided to sign him and we will see that throughout the season.' Luis Enrique took over as Barca coach at the end of last term after guiding Celta to a ninth-place finish and earning plaudits for an entertaining playing style. Enrique watches Lionel Messi in training, ahead of a game against his old club Celta Vigo this weekend . Brazil star Neymar has started this season in great form for the Catalan club, who have begun well . Under new Argentine coach Eduardo Berizzo, Celta have made a fine start to their latest campaign and are sixth after nine matches, six points behind joint leaders Barca and Sevilla. 'It's a game that is more special to prepare for,' Luis Enrique said. 'It is even a bit strange as I know all their players so well,' he added. 'They are a very hard-working team, with a coach who wants them to keep the ball. A win for Barcelona on Saturday would take them three points ahead of Sevilla at the top of La Liga . 'They don't take risks, they go after the ball, they pressure you. I am very pleased with the way they have started the season.' Barca can pull three points clear of Sevilla with a win at the Nou Camp as the Andalusians are not playing at Athletic Bilbao until Sunday. Real are a point behind Barca and Sevilla in third and play at Granada on Saturday.","Barca manager Luis Enrique defends his new striker .

"Rio Ferdinand has labelled the FA 'ludicrous' after his three-match ban for using the word 'sket' - slang for a promiscuous female - on Twitter. The QPR defender tweeted on Friday: 'Is humour even allowed....I'm baffled! Ludicrous.... & I don't mean the rapper' before replying 'preach' to a user who said: 'I can see that he FA have operated a double standard here. They have not prosecuted Mackay & Moody & Referee Elray for using....' Former Cardiff duo Malkay Mackay and Iain Moody are not expected to be charged over their exchange of sexist, racist and homophobic texts and emails. While David Elleray was ordered to take an equality and diversity training course after making racist comments to another official. Queens Park Rangers defender Rio Ferdinand has been given a three-game suspension by the FA . Ferdinand tweeted his anger at the FA'S punishment on Friday . Ferdinand has been charged for this tweet, made on September 1, for using the slang term 'sket' Some people believe Ferdinand has been the victim of a witch-hunt, and he may never work for the FA . VIDEO Ferdinand banned for Twitter taunt . Ferdinand's 'preach' comment indicates that he agrees that the FA have dealt him a harsh punishment compared to other similar offences. The 35-year-old is furious at his treatment by the FA - who found him guilty of misconduct for abusing another user of the social media platform on September 30 - and may withdraw his support from future FA initiatives. After sending the tweet on Friday, Ferdinand was quickly backed-up by his QPR team-mate Joey Barton on Twitter. The midfielder wrote: 'Can I say 'wet wipe' without getting a 83 game ban or a £14,000,000 fine? 'Wonder what words I can use? #nonoffensiveretorts . 'Surely a person has the right to be offensive? Especially if someone offends you? Shambolic that @rioferdy5 misses 3 games and loses £25k. Joey Barton took to Twitter to support his team-mate Ferdinand, describing his ban as 'an absolute disgrace' 'I understand the need to reprimand him. He's a human being who has reacted to some unfair criticism. 'But the punishment isn't fitting of the crime in my opinion. 3 games is violent conduct. Terry only got 4 games for racial abuse? '3 games and £25k for a tweet? Come on.' The pair then began their own conversation on the social media site, with Barton describing the punishment given to Ferdinand as 'an absolute disgrace'. Ferdinand began by writing to Barton: '@Joey7Barton its a Tepid tweet....3games im not even going to hashtag it!!' The former Manchester City man replied: '@rioferdy5 I have said way worse I am sure. Don't understand how you can be banned from football. It's nothing to do with it. 'It's an absolute disgrace. They have set a dangerous precedent now. Looking forward to seeing them police this? #muppets' Barton has called for the FA to clarify their rules on offensive language used on social media . Barton didn't hold back on Twitter, sarcastically questioning whether he could expect a ban from the FA . Barton then called on the FA to clarify their rules regarding offensive language on social media, adding: 'Can someone from the @FA send me a list of offensive, ban incurring words that I can't use online and the requisite bans attached to each.' Ferdinand also received support from Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker, who tweeted: 'Must say I think the @rioferdy5 3 game ban is ridiculously harsh. A little warning would have sufficed, surely.' Some people in football believe Ferdinand is the victim of a witch-hunt. Ferdinand was a member of FA chairman Greg Dyke's commission that was set up to safeguard the future of the national game and has previously stated a desire to become England manager one day. That is all in jeopardy after the FA commission banned him for three games, fined him £25,000 and ordered the former England defender to attend an education programme. Although Ferdinand accepts that his response on social media to a tweet about his performances in a QPR shirt was inappropriate, other players have escaped FA scrutiny. Five days ago Barton accused Barcelona forward Neymar of being 'Messi's fluffer' on Twitter. A 'fluffer' is a slang term used in the adult entertainment industry, but the FA's disciplinary team have yet to call the midfielder to account. Ferdinand is active on social media, with 5.9million followers on his Twitter page and over 14,500 tweets . Barton has yet to hear from the FA after referring to Barcelona's Neymar as Lionel Messi's 'fluffer' Harry Redknapp criticised Ferdinand's ban and believes footballers would be better off without Twitter . Barton also claimed that Oscar Pistorius 'definitely intended to kill her (Reeva Steenkamp)' in yet another outburst that has escaped FA punishment. Ferdinand, who is scheduled to miss QPR's games against Chelsea, Manchester City and Newcastle, is still considering whether to appeal against the verdict. His manager Harry Redknapp criticised Ferdinand's ban, which was at the same level as a red card for a two-footed tackle. Redknapp said: 'The same as a two-footed challenge? No. If someone slags him off and he goes back and slags them off. It doesn't equate. I genuinely don't know what goes on on Twitter. It would save all the hassle if no-one was on Twitter.'","Queens Park Rangers defender Rio Ferdinand banned for three games .

"Ryan Shawcross was grappling in the area with Graziano Pelle on Wednesday evening, despite Stoke's assistant manager insisting he had been brought off man marking and onto zonal marking.

'So instead of Ryan marking from a corner, we put him in an area where he could attack the ball in a more zonal area. 'That's not his game, he's not been brought up on that. 'But it comes to something where you've got to try and change your system of marking because you're worried the lad is getting targeted. 'He's our captain, one of our best headers of the ball. You want Ryan Shawcross to be marking their most dangerous player. 'Even if Ryan doesn't do a full grab but the referee is looking for him, you couldn't leave that to chance.

"CLICK HERE to read our match report. Join Sportsmail for minute-by-minute coverage from La Liga as Barcelona host Celta Vigo at the Camp Nou. Luis Suarez made his debut for the Catalan giants in the defeat to Real Madrid last week, and will hope for a positive result on his home bow. Barca can leapfrog Madrid to top the table once again with a victory against a Celta Vigo side that have impressed this season and lie in sixth. Host commentator . Host commentator . Suarez's home debut ends in defeat and he has lost his first two Barca matches. The new tremendous front three has not worked out well so far! Well that's all from me folks. Thanks for tuning in! Good night! Well, that game was quite incredible. Barca had tens of chances - and on another day Messi, Suarez and Neymar would EACH have had hat-tricks - but they have lost 1-0 at home to Celta Vigo. Celta put in a phenomenal shift and, thanks to a goal from Larrivey and some magnificent shot-stopping from Alvarez, they ensure Barca remain third in the table behind Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid. Suarez must have thought he had scored a goal on his home debut, but Alvarez had other ideas. After Suarez received the ball in the middle of the box he smashes a shot across the goal and Alvarez dives well to his right and gets a massive hand to it to turn it around the post. Incredible save. The substitute Charles receives the ball on his chest, facing away from goal and 10 yards out. He does two keep-ups, flicks it over Mathieu and then tries to chip it over Bravo who makes the save. That would have been a wondergoal. Barcelona have hit the woodwork FOUR times in this game now. Messi takes a free-kick from 25 yards which whips and curls before rattling the very top-right hand corner of the goalframe. How have they not scored? Celta are still looking dangerous on the counter attack and Nolito nearly doubles the lead. He receives a cross and volleys the ball at Bravo who saves low, only for substitute Charles to hit the rebound over the bar. Very wasteful from Messi who whips the free-kick high and wide from the edge of the area. Gomez is a bit unlucky because it seems he got the ball but he has given away a free-kick on the edge of the box and gotten booked in the process. Suarez and Neymar perform a one-two and Gomez hauls the former down. It really has the feeling that it might be one of those days. Barca have had a ridiculous number of chances and Alvarez has made countless saves. This time Pedro crosses to Suarez who, along with two other Barca players, is completely unmarked in the box but he heads straight into Alvarez's hands. Large swathes of the Nou Camp sit in quiet bemusement. This was not what the home unveiling of the Suarez-Messi-Neymar attacking trident was meant to be like. It is quite incredible that they haven't scored yet but Barca are behind. Messi whips a corner in but it is easily cleared and Enrique needs to make some changes here. Alvarez does make a good save with his foot from Messi though. Messi whips in a free-kick from the left-hand side and Johny does well to nod it out for a corner. Barca are getting a bit desperate now, but they have missed countless chances already. Incredible, absolutely incredible. Awful defending from Dani Alves, who does not get rid of the ball and Nolito does a wonderful backheel. Busquets loses the run of Larrivey and he sticks the ball into the bottom right-hand corner. Barca have been wasteful but Celta have also looked quite solid at times. Yes, the home side could have had four or five, but Johnny and Radoja have been particularly good for the visitors. Jordi Alba breaks down the left and he passes the ball square to Neymar who is only eight yards out. His finish is quite lethargic though and the ball hits the bar and goes over once more. A goal must come soon... surely... Surely it's only a matter of time before one of Barca's star strikers score because they simply have too much quality not to find the back of the net soon. Expect Barcelona to go full throttle after the break. The Suarez, Messi, Neymar front three has burst into life in fits and starts but there's more to come and the crowd knows it. No whistles at half-time, which is rare - if Barcelona aren't winning, there's normally a few complaints. Neymar has been denied again. The Brazilian is clean through on goal and puts a shot across the keeper but Alvarez does brilliantly to tip it wide of the post. Alvarez has been on top, top form here. He has shown glimpses Suarez but he has still not reached the heights of last season as he recovers his fitness. The Uruguayan hits a left-footed shot from just outside the area and Alvarez does well to dive to his left and save it. Celta have had to endure a bombardment of attacks but they have also offered some threat themselves. Nolito is making a nuisance of himself and Larrivey has also been decent, with Hernandez and Gomez offering some threat in the air too. Both sides have had chances and Messi in particular you would have expected to have scored by now. He has had at least three opportunities, as has Neymar, and yet neither have found the back of the net. Messi has had another glorious chance and how has the ball not gone in? Neymar threads his team-mate through and he round the keeper before sliding the ball towards goal and Johny slides in. The ball seems destined for the back of the net but Johny clears it off the line and on to the crossbar. Neymar does brilliantly and he cuts the ball back for Lionel Messi, who curls a shot towards goal. The effort has pace and Sergio Alvarez in the Celta goal does brilliantly to tip it over and wide for a corner. Barcelona supporters chant Luis Enrique's name, a show of support, despite the club's humbling at the hands of arch-rivals Real Madrid last weekend. Neymar should have had a hat-trick but Hernandez has come close from a corner. Celta are looking decent here and from set pieces they look extremely dangerous. Disappointing from Suarez, who messes up his central pass in a good attacking area... Celta then break but Nolito's effort deflects into Bravo's hands. As usual in the 17th minute the crowd chant for independence. It's louder than usual today, as we approach the date which the (now cancelled) referendum had been set for. The crowd here have seen Suarez once before, in a cameo role at the end of a pre-season friendly. Now they're getting the real deal and there's an electricity in the atmosphere when he gets on the ball. That said, it's been Neymar who has come the closest to scoring. Celta are given a free-kick 20 yards out in a great area. Nolito breaks free and Mascherano just catches him... Nolito, the former Barca player, steps up... but it's well over the bar. He should have done better, getting well underneath it. Yellow card for Hernandez of Celta after a collision in mid-air with Busquets. Not sure why... but the referee seems to think he's elbowed the Spanish midfielder. Replays show he didn't... but good old Sergio Busquets is making the most of it. CHANCE! Neymar could have had a hat-trick already... the Brazilian curls a pearler from 20 yards but hits the bar and goes clear. Great effort, surely a goal is just around the corner. CHANCE! Celta clear a free-kick but Rakitic whips in a delightful ball from the left... Neymar is unmarked but his header is straight at Sergio from eight yards. Good chance wasted again by Barcelona's top scorer. CHANCE! Suarez twists and turns and plays a great ball into Neymar inside the area... the Brazilian takes a touch when he really doesn't need to. It brings him away from goal and Celta Vigo recover. The visitors already split open and Barca are pressing well. Rakitic releases Suarez down the left wing, but his cross is too deep and picked up by Rafinha near the touchline. His pull-back doesn't reach Alaba and goalkeeper Sergio collects. Barca haven't let Celta have a touch as yet, as you'd expect. The visitors are sixth in La Liga, with 16 points, eight off leaders Real Madrid. Luis Enrique needs a performance after the Clasico defeat, and will it come against his former side? 'An air of anticipation at the Nou Camp with Luis Suarez set to make his home debut.

LIVERPOOL: (4-3-3) Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet made some impressive saves but couldn't keep out Perez's strike . Simon Mignolet - 5 . Flapped at crosses and did not command his area. Looks nervy right now. Glen Johnson - 5.5 . Was troubled by Ameobi early on but saved his side with goal-line block before half-time. Martin Skrtel - 6 . A couple of shaky moments but was strong apart and perhaps should have scored with first-half header. Dejan Lovren - 5.5 . Didn’t have a great deal to do in fairness but Rodgers wasn’t pleased with some of his distribution. Alberto Moreno - 5 . His error proved costly when dithering to allow Perez to score. Liverpool full back up against Obertan was at fault for the decisive goal in the second-half against Newcastle . Jordan Henderson - 5.5 . Failed to impact and barely got a kick first-half. Didn’t fare much better after break. Steven Gerrard - 6 . Tidy enough but nothing telling from the skipper and raking passes came to precious little. Former England captain Steven Gerrard couldn't prevent his Liverpool side losing at St James' Park . Joe Allen (Off 66') - 5 . Passed the ball efficiently without ever penetrating United’s backline. Philippe Coutinho (Off 80') - 6 . Looked Liverpool’s best bet of conjuring something in final third. Mario Balotelli - 5.5 . Anonymous first half, although he was too isolated. Came into game after break but still not enough from the Italian. Mercurial striker Mario Balotelli was closely marked at Newcastle and was isolated for large parts of the game . Raheem Sterling - 5 . A subdued afternoon and he’ll be disappointed with this performance. No end product. Substitutes: . Fabio Borini (On 66') - 6 .

"Steven Gerrard is holding talks with Liverpool over a possible contract extension, manager Brendan Rodgers has revealed. The 34-year-old's current deal expires in June 2015, meaning he would be allowed to hold talks with other clubs in January. Rodgers explained he had met with Gerrard's agent and then approached the club's owners about  securing a new deal for the club captain. Steven Gerrard mentioned the possibility of leaving Liverpool in an interview with Sportsmail on Friday . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers wants his captain to sign a contract extension to remain at Anfield . Gerrard, pictured in action against Hull, insists he has no plans to retire at the end of this season . Speaking to BT Sport, Rodgers said: 'Steven is a wonderful player. The situation is very simple. I have already spoken with Steven's representative over a week ago so a real productive good conversation and we took that to the ownership and they are obviously now in the process of getting a deal hopefully agreed and done. 'In terms of Steven, he's a player of course we want to keep. He has been a big part of my plans since I have been here. 'I've said it a number of times, he's a player that going forward I still want to very much be a part of my plans so hopefully that can be done very soon.' After losing talismanic striker Luis Suarez in the summer, Rodgers will be keen to avoid the departure of further influential players. The club experienced huge change over the summer, with nine new players arriving, and Rodgers admitted the process was more a matter of necessity than preference. Gerrard and Rodgers discuss tactics during Liverpool's 0-0 draw with Hull City at Anfield last weekend . Rodgers believes Gerrard, pictured celebrating against Everton, still has a key role to play at Liverpool . 'It was not even a bold step (to do that),' said Rodgers on Friday. 'It's what we had to do. We couldn't go this season with the same group of players. And also we lost a top player. 'So some of it had to be done. It was clear we needed to do that and it is clear that some of the young players that have come in, we've see their qualities. It's just going to take them time to adapt.' Rodgers added: 'The players we brought in were not really established. With young players, you get mistakes. Then there is the lifestyle. You have adaptation, new players coming into a different way of life. It may be difficult for other people to understand it because of where we were last season. 'As I said the natural progress of the team was halted a wee bit because we lost a world class talent.'

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers should invest in his backroom staff to turn around the club's fortunes claims former Manchester United first-team coach Rene Meulensteen. The Anfield side are already nine points off unbeaten league leaders Chelsea and have lost their last two Champions League matches. Meulensteen, who was in charge at Fulham for just two months before being replaced in February, believes Rodgers needs to appoint someone with champions League experience. Brendan Rodgers discusses tactics with Steven Gerrard during Liverpool's 0-0 draw with Hull last weekend . Rene Meulensteen, pictured during his spell as Fulham boss, criticised Rodgers for not investing in his staff . 'Brendan Rodgers's biggest failure is that he's not invested in his staff,' Meulensteen told BBC Radio 5 live.

Hana and May May have played down fears surrounding their father's health in an exclusive interview with NBC News' Today. In a sit down interview with Matt Lauer, May May said: 'Unfortunately, certain family members that don’t understand Parkinson’s might misspeak because they don’t see him as often so when they do see him, they think he’s doing worse than what he is.

Hana and May May were speaking with American television journalist Matt Lauer on the Today show . Ali was diagnosed with Parkinson's disese in 1984. Parkinson's disease is a condition which has a major impact on the nerve cells in the brain. The main symptoms include body tremors, stiff/inflexible muscles and slow movement. 'But he is fine people, don’t be worried.' Hana added on the former boxer's inability to communicate: 'For me that’s been frustrating, my father still communicates and we’re lucky to be able to talk to him and see him more often than most people, so we still get it, it’s just a softer voice. 'Now we have the blessing of these audio recordings.' Ali's two daughters also commented on what their father was like around the house before he started suffering from Parkinson's disease. 'For us he was larger than life at home too. He chased us around the house in Halloween masks when it wasn’t Halloween, he was always playing jokes, doing magic tricks,' said Hana. 'He had a spiritual side around the house that was pretty profound,' added May May. Ali used to chase his daughters around the house in Halloween masks, revealed daughter Ali .

Be free to be who you are. There’s still a lot of discrimination and disparities in this county; everyone is equal. 'My father at the end of the day, he fought for that equality.

"Read Martin Samuel's column here . A final thought on the toxic fall-out between Rio Ferdinand and John Terry. Might the Football Association have been able to broker a rapprochement? Here were two players who had stood side by side through countless internationals. With Ferdinand now saying he sought a quick resolution, a simple apology, and did not consider Terry a racist, was there not more common ground than was previously assumed? The police involvement was the prime complication, yet even this may not have been insurmountable. In a less complicated era, matters on the football field were invariably handled by the FA alone. The police did not want to be involved every time two players got into a fight, and the FA did not want confrontations to end up in court. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ferdinand book criticises Moyes and Terry . Rio Ferdinand and John Terry on their last appearance together for England, in 2011 - they now do not speak . Terry and Ferdinand before that match against Switzerland in 2011 (left) and they hug it out vs the USA in 2008 . As long as the FA guaranteed stiff discipline and justice, the police were happy to keep their distance. It is the reason Paul Davis of Arsenal was not prosecuted for breaking Southampton midfielder Glenn Cockerill’s jaw in 1988. Could the FA have told the police that they would deal with Terry? Did they even try? At the time, it more appeared that they backed off the moment the police were involved. Most likely the nature of the offence would have left them terrified; frightened to be thought complacent, or accused of going soft and ignoring racial sensitivities if they merely tried to bring the sides together. Yet a less punitive, swifter and more positive resolution is what Ferdinand says he wanted. Why, three years on, is the wound still sore? Why, so long after, does it continue to feel like there could have been a better way?

"Steven Taylor says Newcastle's recent run of form has given the players some much-needed self-belief, and insisted Alan Pardew has the whole team's backing. Ayoze Perez's second-half strike was enough to secure an impressive victory for Newcastle over a beleaguered Liverpool, and move Pardew's side into the top half of the Premier League. 'The belief is back now. We showed what we're all about,' Taylor told BT Sport. 'There was a great atmosphere today. Everybody's fully behind him (Pardew) we just need to keep winning. We've got a bit of momentum but we can't get carried away.' Newcastle fans hold up a banner commenting on their team's recent resurgence under Alan Pardew . Steven Taylor said the recent run of results has given Newcastle players much-needed self-belief . Algerian midfielder Mehdi Abeid made his first start for Newcastle in the win, and the 22-year-old said he was delighted to be back at the club after three loan spells. He said: 'I've been out on loan for a long time. Now I'm back I'm just trying to do my best. I've tried to be patient and all the work has paid off for me.' Pardew witnessed pockets of support for him in what has been a hostile home crowd, but the 53-year-old refused to pay too much attention to either the praise or criticism he has been receiving.

"It was risk with very little reward. Kit Symons is so confident of becoming Fulham's new manager that his team selection dictated that they were dumped out of the Capital One Cup with a clear eye on more pressing matters. The truth is that he may look back on Derby's astonishing comeback – including five goals in 19 minutes - and wonder whether they should have really attacked the competition with more vigour. The caretaker, who had won five of his eight games in charge before this, is still expected to be announced as Felix Magath's successor on Thursday and Moussa Dembele's double before half-time had looked to put the Cottagers through to the last eight. Derby County's Simon Dawkins celebrates his fifth and Derby's second goal to cap off the comebakck . Dawkins beats Fulham goalkeeper Gabor Kiraly as Derby score five in 19 minutes . Caretaker manager Kit Symons greets the fans as he receives a warm reception . More than 3,000 Derby fans travelled to Craven Cottage for the Capital One Cup tie . Fulham (4-2-3-1): Kiraly 6; Hoogland 5.5, Hutchinson 5, Arthurworrey 6, Kavanagh 6.5; Zverotic 6.5, Hyndman 6.5; Williams 7 (David 72 - 6), Ruiz 6.5 (Eisfeld 86), Roberts 6.5 (McCormack 72 - 6); Dembele 8 . Subs not used: Stafylidis, Eisfled, Parker, Burn, Bettinelli . Derby County (4-3-3): Roos 5.5; Christie 6.5, Keogh 7, Buxton 6, Forsyth 5, Mascarell 5.5 (Coutts 69 - 6), Hendrick 7, Bryson 6.5 (Hughes 77 - 6); Russell 7.5, Dawkins 8.5 (Ibe 75 - 6), Martin 7.5 . Subs not used: Mitchell, L Naylor, Calero, Thomas . Referee: G Scott 7 . But they were shocked by promotion-hunting Derby who turned the tie on its head in blistering fashion. 'It was very disappointing,' Symons reflected. 'We became disjointed. It's a very harsh lesson for the young players. There was always the chance that would've been the case with a young side out. I put a team out I expected to win the game. I don't regret it. 'Maybe 90 minutes was a bit too long at that level for some of them. I'd hope we would've done better. 'One result doesn't hamper my chances.' A stunning goal flurry showed just why Steve McClaren's side top the second tier and are everyone's tip to be plying their trade in the Premier League this time next year. It was patently obvious that Fulham weren't overly bothered either way if they managed to progress into the quarter-finals – even though a maximum of six top flight teams will be in the hat after this week's fourth round ties. There were eight home changes here, including a debut for 20-year-old academy product Stephen Arthurworrey. Even Gabor Kiraly – with those trademark grey jogging bottoms – was given an outing. The goalkeeper had conceded five in his last game – Magath's final hurrah at Nottingham Forest– and it so happened that the fate would befall him again, making it 13 to fly in his net in just three games for the club. Moussa Dembele of Fulham celebrates after opening the scoring at Craven Cottage . Dembele scores his second goal to give Fulham a comfortable lead in the Fourth Round tie . Dembele runs towards the home crowd to celebrate his double on Tuesday night . Chris Martin scores from the penalty spot as Derby narrow the deficit before half time . Derby skipper Richard Keogh manhandled Stephen Arthurworrey from a corner but the Fulham defender wriggled free and almost powered the hosts ahead. The hosts had set about creating the same sort of tempo with which they have excelled since Symons took over Magath's disjointed mess last month, as Dembele bent a wicked effort straight into Roos' midriff before being brilliant foiled when clean through. Dembele wasn't to be denied for long however; the striker, who hadn't scored this season, intercepted Craig Forsyth's ludicrously lapse back pass to round Roos and slip home the opener in the 27th minute. More confusion at the back for Derby – Omar Mascarell the culprit - allowed Dembele to comfortably slot in his second. Johnny Russell was excellently thwarted by Kiraly's legs as they tried to prevent consecutive defeats for the first time this season. That they did, and in some style. Tim Hoogland's reckless handball set the ball rolling, meaning Chris Martin emphatically halved the deficit from the spot. The inexperience of Fulham's youthful side told seconds after the restart as Simon Dawkins' pull-back from the byline was diverted into Russell's path and he hammered an equaliser past Kiraly in front of 3,000 travelling fans. That healthy contingent went wild nine minutes later when Dawkins sauntered in from the left and smashed beyond the Hungarian to complete an astonishing comeback. John Russell of Derby levels the score with a strike shortly after half time . Russell celebrates the goal that triggered Derby's comeback . Dawkins scores his first goal to put Derby ahead against Fulham for the first time . 'We played like ourselves second half,' McClaren beamed. That was no over-exaggeration. The Rams weren't finished there – not by a long shot. Derby were rampant and Ireland midfielder Jeff Hendrick thundered in the fourth from close range with Fulham now all over the place. Home fans began to leave by the time Dawkins sumptuously flicked past the bystanding Kiraly from Russell's clever centre, and you couldn't blame them. What Symons may be privately pondering though is whether he made the right call by taking such a brazen approach to this. Owner Shahid Khan is highly unlikely to have a last-gasp change of heart – he'd be folly to – but the presumed next incumbent hasn't done himself any favours. McClaren – who had invited Symons to study his work at Twente while completing a Uefa Pro Licence - wisely added: 'If they don't give Kit the job tomorrow I'd be very surprised.'

"Just nine games in to the Sky Bet Championship season and Norwich City are already 16 points clear of Fulham, and eight ahead of Cardiff. For the trio relegated from the Barclays Premier League in May, it is hard not to conclude that their current league positions - first, 15th and 23rd respectively - are a direct result of each club's preparations for the 2014-15 campaign. While Fulham were still frantically buying and selling with no apparent plan right up to the close of the transfer window last month, Norwich had a settled and balanced squad before the first ball of the season was kicked. Cardiff, too, were preoccupied with transfer dealings and distracted by off-field squabbles when they should have been concentrating on their fixtures. Fulham recorded their first win of the Championship season at Birmingham City on Saturday . Hugo Rodallega notched the winner for Fulham at St Andrew's . It was no surprise then when Felix Magath lost his job at Fulham after their disastrous start and when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's stay in South Wales came to an end 11 days ago. While all this has been going on, Norwich have been making serene and steady progress under Neil Adams. They sit top of the table after the weekend's fixtures. It is no fluke. Faced with the very real possibility of relegation in April, the Norwich board sacked Chris Hughton. They were in fact five points clear of the drop zone at the time, but with a nightmare run of fixtures coming up they made the bold move to invest in the long-term in favour of the short. In came Adams, so successful as Norwich's youth coach and a man with close ties to the club from his playing career. Hughton had achieved an 11th-placed finish the season before but a steady decline had seen the natives grow restless as transfer funds were wasted on failed foreign imports such as Ricky van Wolfswinkel. In hiring Adams, chief executive David McNally felt, even if Norwich went down, the feel-good factor would soon be back in Norfolk. And so it is proving, even if we are only nine games in to the season. Felix Magath's transfer policy was highly quested at Fulham during the close season . The club sold their prized assets for top dollar; swiftly and efficiently and with no hard feelings. Handsome fees were brought in for Robert Snodgrass and Leroy Fer, among others, allowing Adams to concentrate on adding Championship experience and a sprinkling of youth from the club's academy to an already strong squad. While Norwich were not turning many heads with their pre-season work, one senses that was exactly the plan. Contrast that to the circuses going on at Craven Cottage and the Cardiff City Stadium this year, and it is easy to see how such a gap has already opened up between Norwich and their relegated counterparts. Mercifully, things finally seem to be moving in the right direction at Fulham and Cardiff, but the moral of the story is never to underestimate the Championship. Josh Murphy celebrates scoring Norwich's third goal in a comfortable 3-1 win at Blackpool on Saturday . Russell Slade is primed to take over the manager's job at Cardiff after leaving Leyton Orient next week . While Russell Slade looks to be a shrewd appointment at Cardiff and Kit Symons is steadying the ship at Fulham, you cannot afford to give your rivals a nine-game headstart at this level, no matter how much money you have to spend in January. The Football League is littered with clubs who have taken years to recover from relegation from the top flight because they didn't face up to it in time and invest in their long-term futures. Norwich were one of those clubs. Never recovering from relegation in 2005 and eventually slipping down in to League One in 2009. Perhaps that is why they have made moves to make sure the same doesn't happen again. Good week for... BRENTFORD. Here's a stat for you: Brentford are the only side in the top half of the Championship not to have played in the Premier League before. More importantly, Saturday's 2-0 win over Leeds at Griffin Park has lifted Mark Warburton's Bees nine points clear of the relegation zone. Keep up this form, and soon they may be able to start dreaming of the play-offs. Bad week for... BARNSLEY. Returning for a second spell at Oakwell after he guided the club to the top flight in 1997, Danny Wilson thought he had assembled a Barnsley squad capable of returning to the Championship at the first attempt this season. Already though, he appears on borrowed time after Saturday's 3-0 home defeat by Swindon. The Tykes are in the League One relegation zone. Jota Peleteiro (centre) celebrates after scoring the opening goal during Brentford's win against Leeds . After a poor start to the season, Exeter are well and truly up and running following three successive victories, the latest coming against Bury, who led the League Two table before their 2-1 defeat on Saturday. Over half of Paul Tisdale's squad have come through the club's academy and perhaps the brighest prospect of them all, 19-year-old midfielder Grimes, showed his class by curling home a left-footed free-kick to give them the lead at St James Park.","Neil Adams' Norwich top the Championship table .

"Antoine Griezmann scored twice and Koke had a hand in three goals as Atletico Madrid cruised to a 4-2 win against Cordoba. Griezmann put Atletico ahead just before the break but Nabil Ghilas grabbed the first of his two goals to level things up shortly after the interval.

Guilherme Siqueira, Gabi and Turan then all brought saves from Juan Carlos before Atletico took the lead a minute before the break as Griezmann netted his first Primera Division goal. Koke delivered a free-kick from the left touchline and Aleksandar Pantic's headed clearance only went as far as the Frenchman, who brought the ball under control brilliantly with his right foot and fired home with his left courtesy of a huge deflection.

The equaliser also came from a set-piece as the visitors levelled things up in the 54th minute. Fidel whipped in a corner and Ghilas was left completely unmarked at the back post to head home. Cordoba were level for just four minutes, though, as Griezmann scored his second. Some good work down the right resulted in Juanfran supplying a cross and Griezmann was on hand to head past Juan Carlos, who got a hand to the ball but could not keep it out. And just four minutes later it was 3-1 with a Koke free-kick again doing the damage. The Spain international delivered from the left and when Juan Carlos came to punch and missed, Mandzukic hardly had to jump to head into the empty net. Raul Garcia (centre) celebrates with his Atletico Madrid team-mates after they moved second in La Liga . The champions dominated proceedings for the remainder of the half and it was no surprise when the fourth goal arrived nine minutes from time. Koke was again the provider as he crossed from the left and Raul Garcia met the ball with a glancing near-post header which flashed across the face of goal and in.

"Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart is unconcerned by the soft goals his side have conceded this season, suggesting it is down to attempts from manager Manuel Pellegrini to develop their trademark attacking performances. City have conceded 19 goals in 15 matches in all competitions and are third in the Premier League, already trailing leaders Chelsea by nine points. Pellegrini's side will look to cut that deficit when they face Manchester United on Sunday and Hart believes as long as City stick to the Chilean's methods, they will have a successful campaign. Joe Hart (above) said Manchester City's shaky defence is due to attempts to improve thier attacking displays . City manager Manuel Pellegrini (above) has seen his side concede 19 goals already so far this season . ""We've leaked goals, simple goals have gone in and people have taken their chances against us, but with the way we play, we are quite open to conceding the odd goal or two,"" Hart said in an interview with The Independent. ""Unfortunately, that is not great as a goalkeeper, but you've got to be realistic and understand we are trying to build a way of playing football that potentially is going to lead to letting the odd goal in. ""It is not something we accept, but as long as we carry on playing the way we're playing under this philosophy that we've got under the manager, we will be fine."" Hart also dismissed criticism aimed at defender Eliaquim Mangala, a £32million summer arrival from Porto.

Mangala (left) had a difficult match up against Diafra Sakho (right) in the 2-0 loss against West Ham United . Mangala has endured a torrid beginning to his City career, epitomised in City's 2-0 defeat against West Ham United where he was relentlessly targeted by Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia. But Hart believes the France international will prove to be an astute addition to the Premier League champions. ""Mangala knows we are more than confident in him, the manager is more than confident in him, and that is the most important thing.""","Joe Hart said Manchester City's attacking style leaves defence exposed .

"Mumbai City FC manager Peter Reid has explained his decision to leave Nicolas Anelka out of his side’s 3-0 defeat by Kolkata on Sunday despite the All Indian Football Federation giving the striker the all-clear. Sportsmail revealed the AIFF were ready to allow Anelka to play in spite of his ‘quenelle’ ban as they had yet to receive confirmation from FIFA. Anelka missed the game and his side lost 3-0 at Salt Lake stadium. Former Premier League striker Nicolas Anelka did not take part in Mumbai City's opening game of the season . Anelka, pictured with his Mumbai City team-mates on Saturday, hasn't been given official confirmation to play . The Frenchman is among several stars who have joined the Indian Super League . Luis Garcia - Atletico de Kolkata . Elano - Chennaiyin . Alessandro Del Piero - Delhi Dynamos . Robert Pires - Goa . David James - Kerala Blasters . Freddie Ljungberg - Mumbai City . Joan Capdevila - NorthEast United . David Trezeguet - Pune City . Reid said: ‘The original plan was to play him and then go to FIFA (with adequate reasons as to why he was played) but we decided against that because it would put Anelka and football as a whole in a tough situation.’ Reid explained that there was ongoing communication with FIFA over the matter: ‘We are still trying to get clarification on the matter. 'What I can tell you is that we didn’t play him because we didn’t get any official confirmation from FIFA that he could play. We’re still waiting for that.’ Anelka was given a global five-match ban for his ‘quenelle’ gesture which now stands at two as he missed two games while waiting for his West Bromwich Albion contract to terminated and Sunday's match v Kolkata. Anelka received a global five-match ban for the 'quenelle gesture' he made against West Ham in December .

However, the AIFF were prepared to let him play as FIFA has failed to respond to their appeal and calls for clarification. General secretary Kushal Das said: ‘If FIFA tells us that the ban should be served, he will sit out for the next games.’ The FA had called upon FIFA to uphold the ban and responded by stating: ‘This is now a matter for FIFA as we have ensured all correct procedures have been followed in accordance with the rules. As far as we are concerned we expect the sanction to be fully served.’ Article 12 of FIFA’s regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players specifies: ‘Any disciplinary suspension imposed on a player prior to a transfer must be enforced or applied by the new association at which the player is registered. 'The former association is obliged to notify the new association of any sanction in writing and upon issuing the international transfer clearance (ITC).’ Meanwhile, former Crystal Palace and Bolton midfielder Andre Moritz has also joined Mumbai.","Nicolas Anelka missed his side's 3-0 defeat against Kolkata .

"Schalke 04 attacking midfielder Julian Draxler will be out for the rest of the year after picking up a thigh injury in their 1-0 win over Augsburg on Friday, the club said on Saturday. Germany's talented World Cup winner lasted only 11 seconds from the start of the Bundesliga game, pulling a thigh muscle, with sports director Horst Heldt saying it looked serious. 'He was again injured and it looks like a serious muscle injury,' Heldt said. 'I do not expect Julian to play any more in this first half of the season.' Julian draxler (centre) picked up the injury just 11 seconds into Schalke's 1-0 win over Augsburg . The 21-year-old (pictured) is likely to miss the rest of 2014 after picking up a thigh injury on Friday . The news will come as a massive blow to new manager Roberto Di Matteo as the young attacking midfielder is an influential member of the Schalke side. Draxler has been heavily linked with a move away from the Gelsenkirchen club in recent transfer windows with Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger a keen admirer of the Germany international's talents. The 21-year-old is set to miss their remaining three Champions League group games plus Germany's Euro 2016 qualifier against Gibraltar and friendly against Spain next month.","Julian Draxler injured his thigh during Schalke's 1-0 win over Augsburg .

"Nicolas Anelka has had the five match ban for his quenelle gesture reduced after it transpired he missed two games at West Bromwich Albion before his contract was officially cancelled. The 35-year-old, who is waiting to play for Mumbai City in the inaugural Indian Super League, was punished by the FA when his celebration following a goal in the 3-3 draw at West Ham in December last year was deemed to be anti-Semitic. Anelka protested his innocence claiming it was merely an appreciation of French comedian Dieudonne M'bala M'bala who used the expression in his shows. Nicolas Anelka trains with his new club Mumbai City but will have to serve a three-match ban before his debut . Former England midfielder Peter Reid will take charge of Mumbai City in the Indian Super League as he watches star striker Anelka in a training session on the eve of the inaugural campaign . Nicolas Anelka was banned for five matches by the FA in February for making a quenelle gesture in a Premier League clash for West Brom at West Ham last December . However, that failed to convince the FA and West Bromwich Albion. He was fined £80,000 and banned for five games with Albion ultimately sacking him for gross misconduct in March after he tweeted he was to cancel his contract for being asked to curb his behaviour. Yet the two week notice period that Albion served on Anelka subsequently also allowed him to miss two games which have now been counted as part of his ban. On arriving as one of Mumbai's marquee signings, the FA had asked FIFA and the Indian Federation to uphold their decision but Anelka's representatives have successfully challenged the length of the ban and he is now due to miss just the first three games of the season which kicks off on Sunday with Mumbai facing Atletico de Kolkata. Mumbai manager Peter Reid said: 'Nicolas has always protested that his actions were misunderstood and underlined throughout that he is not a racist. He is pivotal to our plans so it's good news for Mumbai and the Indian Super League.' Peter Reid meets his star player Nicolas Anelka ahead of the beginning of the Indian Super League . Meanwhile, Reid says the inaugural Indian Super League heralds a time for India to shed its ‘poor boy image’. The 58-year-old former England international midfielder is manager of Mumbai City who kick off the new season on October 12 against Atletico de Kolkata . Organisers hope this is the start of a new dawn in India with the launch of the high-profile ISL and the country hosting the Fifa U17 World Cup in 2017. The former France international is mobbed by fans on his arrival to play for Mumbai City . The league has taken three years to get off the ground, and those involved hope it will help loosen cricket’s stranglehold on India’s sporting public. Similar to the steps taken by the USA’s NASL in the 1970s, the league will boast some big names, albeit ageing ones, from Europe, with Freddie Ljungberg, Robert Pires, Alessandro del Piero, Mikael Silvestre and David Trezeguet among them. The league represents a huge investment with money coming from India’s booming businesses and Bollywood stars but the aim is to attract younger generations to participate and sustain the interest across the country. Reid said: ‘I feel this is the right time for football in India to shed its poor boy image. This is what happened in England when open terraces went and seating was forced on the teams. The rate of a ticket is high but, now, everything comes at a price. ‘The key message is that football can make everything attainable. We are working with the community too and encouraging their participation. I’m a big cricket fan and cricket is huge here but we want football to become another major part of their lives.’ World Cup winner Marco Materazzi has come to India as player-manager for Chennaiyin FC . Former Arsenal forward Robert Pires (R) is another superstar to join the inaugural ISL . ‘We went to watch a game the other day and there was real mixture of people in the crowd. All aspects of life and that’s what we want football to be about. It’s a game for the people and we want the people of India to embrace the sport and fall in love with the game,' he added. Reid has welcomed Anelka and Ljungberg to Mumbai over the past few days as excitement mounts for the season’s kick-off and he insists he aims to entertain but win. ‘I have a philosophy and I like to use the wingers. But I have to look at my players and play according to strength. If I have players who pass the ball, then we pass the ball. But in these conditions (heat and humidity), we need to adapt well, not pass the ball excessively. Anelka is looking to resurrect his career after leaving the Premier League under a cloud of controversy . Former Arsenal midfielder Freddie Ljungberg rests during a training session ahead of the season's start . ‘We want to be able to adapt our style to win. I am not preparing anyone in Mumbai City to face Barcelona. However, what people forget about Barcelona is their pressing game, the way they get the ball back. If we can get that kind of shape at the back, I would be happy. ‘It’s a simple process, when you have the ball, keep it...when you don’t, try and get the ball.’ Talking to the Times of India, Reid added: ‘I am coming here to coach players I don’t know. Obviously I know Nickolas Anelka, I know Freddie Ljunberg, but the Indians, I am learning. ‘It is a new league, it’s exciting. The players are getting to know me.’ India icon Sachin Tendulkar added to the romance of the occasion  by bringing in former East Manchester FC player Duleep Menon to play for his franchise Kerala Blasters, who are coached by David James. Menon, 27, has been drafted in after impressing during a friendly playing for Central Excise against Blasters in Thrissur.

Sachin asked me to calm down. It feels like a dream.’ David James said: ‘He was superb against us in that practice game.

"Ronny Deila insists he wants the future of Kris Commons fixed before the January transfer window. Last season’s Scottish player of the year is now in the final year of his contract and can speak with other clubs in the new year. Bolton Wanderers, now managed by Neil Lennon, are keen to secure Commons on a pre-contract agreement. Kris Commons (centre) is an obvious target for ex-Celtic manager Neil Lennon at new club Bolton Wanderers . Despite racking up four straight wins in the playmaker’s absence through injury, Deila says Commons still has a role to play in the club’s future and wants things settled sooner rather than later. ‘Of course we want it sorted,’ said the Norwegian. ‘Everyone wants that. ‘It’s up to the club and Kris to get an agreement.’ Asked if fixing something before January was his wish, Deila added: ‘Of course that’s the case. There’s nothing new there. The only new thing is his injury. ‘Again we need to assess all the time what is going on. Older players are easier to deal with than 19-year-old players. Lennon (pictured) brought Commons to Celtic for £300,000 in a deal which is widely considered a big success . ‘We have more control over the situation when players are older and also you assess more things as they get older. ‘Kris is important in the group and in the team.’ Ruled out with an awkward injury from recent games, Deila is hopeful Commons is on the mend. ‘We won’t take any chances and there has been improvement so hopefully he will be in the team quickly.’ Injury-plagued Dutch winger Derk Boerrigter shows no sign of returning to first-team action before 2015 after undergoing surgery on a knee injury. ‘He has jumper’s knee and has had this for a while. He’s had an operation in Sweden and will be out for two months. We won’t see him before January.’ Scotland forward Commons has scored lots of important goals for Celtic over the last few seasons .

"Holed up in the football academy he runs for the Craig Bellamy Foundation in Sierra Leone as fear and suspicion spreads throughout Africa, Johnny McKinstry is standing firm. When he was sacked as manager of the national team last month, his worried parents urged him to come home to Northern Ireland. But even though more than 1,200 people have been killed by Ebola in Sierra Leone and his former players are being treated like ‘fugitives’, the academy in the capital Freetown is now a sanctuary from the devastating disease and 29-year-old McKinstry has vowed to stay on. ‘We are like an extended family here and that’s what I told my parents,’ says McKinstry, as he sits in his spartan office in the middle of the 15-acre complex. An Ivory Coast fan holds a placard reading 'Stop Ebola' during 2015 African Cup of Nations qualifier . ‘There are 27 boys here and, before each enrolled, I went to meet his parents. The first thing I always said was, “I’ll look after your son”. I meant it and can’t go back on that now. If I was just doing this job for myself, I’d probably have gone home but people are relying on me and I have to stay.’ No one is allowed in or out of the academy, which was founded in 2007 and is funded by Bellamy, the only exception being McKinstry’s forays into town once a fortnight to pick up supplies. If anything, the dedication and enthusiasm of the youngsters, who range in age from 12 to 17, has actually improved in recent weeks. ‘I’ve been immensely impressed with the kids,’ says McKinstry. ‘Their strength and focus has just bowled me over.’ The Sierra Leone national team that McKinstry used to coach have become football’s lepers, chased out of every country they visit because of a disease they do not even have. Last month they were banned from playing at home following the outbreak. All their games have become away fixtures and to say they are unwelcome guests is something of an understatement. In the last eight days they played Cameroon home and away. Johnny McKinstry with the kids he has promised to look after at the academy in Sierra Leone . Sierra Leone defender Mustapha Dumbuya, who grew up in Tottenham and plays for Notts County in League One, says: ‘When we arrived in Cameroon, we checked into our hotel and everything seemed fine. ‘Then we were told it was fully booked and that we had to leave immediately. We went to another hotel and it was empty. We were literally the only residents there.’ It turned out that the Cameroon government had asked for the visiting delegation to be quarantined. Dumbuya and a couple of his team-mates ventured out onto the streets and received a by-now-familiar response from the locals. ‘As soon as people saw our training tops, the shouts of, “Ebola, Ebola” started,’ he says. ‘I’m getting used to it to be honest.’ Things first started to change with the Africa Cup of Nations pre-qualifier in the Seychelles in August. The team were refused entry to the country and were held in transit in Nairobi, Kenya, for two days. Full-back Michael Lahoud, who plays for Philadelphia Union in the MLS, says: ‘We felt like fugitives. ‘We were on the run, only we were fleeing from something we didn’t know anything about.’ Eventually the Seychelles forfeited the match, so worried were they about Ebola entering their idyll and ruining the lucrative tourism industry. Nore than 1,200 people have been killed by Ebola in Sierra Leone . This was only the start of Sierra Leone’s problems though. They were banned from playing any matches at home by the Confederation of African Football, meaning all their games were now away fixtures. Ivory Coast wanted to ban them from entering last month and the match was confirmed so late that the Sierra Leone players had to buy their own plane tickets. ‘They tried to ban us from coming, yhen the opposition didn’t want to shake our hands or swap shirts with us,’ said Lahoud. ‘South Africa is the latest country to close its borders to Leone nationals and I can’t help feeling like we have become the scapegoats and face of this disease.’ Things reached their nadir with the fixture against DR Congo in Kinshasa. There was the customary nightmare journey, followed by hostility on the streets. Then came the match in the Mazembe Stadium. Dumbuya says: ‘Before kick-off, Johnny walked out on to the pitch, as he always used to do. ‘He looked a little shaken when he came back into the dressing room and said, “This isn’t going to be easy lads”. He wasn’t wrong. When we walked out of the tunnel the whole place just erupted and we were hit by this deafening noise. Notts County defender Mustapha Dumbuya (left) has vowed to continue playing for Sierra Leone . ‘It didn’t take long to work out what they were chanting — ‘E-BO-LA! E-BO-LA!’ It seemed everyone in the crowd was chanting it.’ Lahoud, who was born in Sierra Leone before moving to Washington DC at the age of five, says he will never forget that day. ‘It stung me and hurt deep inside,’ he says. ‘How could another African country — itself dealing with the disease — react like that?’ Sierra Leone lost the match 2-0 and suddenly their great form under McKinstry had evaporated. These experiences will not deter Dumbuya from representing his country though. ‘All the boys in our squad are so passionate about playing for Sierra Leone,’ he says. ‘That applies more now than ever. We feel like we are representing the country in a positive light and giving the people something to be proud of. I’m in this for the long haul.’ The same, it appears, goes for McKinstry. ‘This is a wonderful country that has only just recovered from a terrible civil war and is now having to contend with another crisis,’ he says. ‘The least I can do is stick around and do a little bit to help.’","The Craig Bellamy Foundation in Sierra Leone is now a sanctuary .

"UEFA president Michel Platini has hit back in a row with the Confederation of African Football after it was alleged he called for the postponement of the 2015 African Nations Cup due to the Ebola outbreak. Platini denies he called for the tournament, scheduled to take place in Morocco in January, to be delayed, describing the suggestion he interfered in CAF's affairs as 'unfair, unwarranted and insulting'. In a letter to CAF counterpart Issa Hayatou, Platini called for the retraction of a CAF statement 'as well as a formal apology'. Platini denies he called for the tournament, scheduled to take place in Morocco in January, to be delayed . It is understood CAF is still refusing to apologise for its statement, despite Platini's letter. Platini wrote: 'It was with great surprise, a deep sense of injustice and considerable disappointment that I learned of the official CAF statement entitled 'CAF against interference of UEFA president in its affairs'.' The UEFA president then provided a full transcript of parts of a television interview which CAF apparently took exception to. Platini has written a strongly worded letter to Confederation of African Football president Issa Hayatou (above) Platini added: 'You know my love of Africa, the African people and African football, and that is why this CAF statement has upset and hurt me so much.' Hosts Morocco had already called for the postponement of the tournament before CAF reacted to a Platini television interview with a statement which provoked his ire. The statement, published on cafonline.com, read: 'CAF under the leadership of its president, Issa Hayatou, has always promoted free expression within it. Far from it therefore, claim to deprive anyone latitude to express themselves. 'But we must beware of what appears in every way as interference by a president of a confederation, in cases involving first and foremost Africa and CAF. 'Under the principle of non-interference required to comply, CAF has refrained so far to comment on some issues on the managing of European football or any other continent. 'Despite the risks involved in armed conflict in Ukraine, a country where a civilian plane was shot down killing nearly 300 people, UEFA did not consider it necessary to exclude Ukrainian clubs from its competitions as a security parameter by hosting games outside this nation, as treacherously raised once it is about Africa. 'CAF hereby reaffirm the importance it attaches to respect of its sovereignty and does not intend to let anyone interfere in the management of its affairs.'","UEFA president denies he called for the tournament to be delayed .

"Click here to view all the stats and graphics from Southampton's win against Stoke City using our fantastic match zone service . Given his age and experience, Peter Crouch was the last man you expected to hit the self-destruct button and cost Stoke City a pulsating cup-tie. Crouch's arrival from the bench had helped inspire a Stoke fightback after they trailed 2-0 at the interval, even though Southampton manager Ronald Koeman noted ruefully 'it was not the way I like to play football'. But having done the hard work and with Stoke back on level terms, the 33-year-old former England striker inexplicably lunged first at Jose Fonte and then Steven Davis to pick up two yellow cards in 80 seconds and leave Stoke a man short for the remaining couple of minutes. Southampton striker striker Graziano Pelle fired his side ahead with an 25-yard drive against Stoke City . Stoke keeper Asmir Begovic was helpless as Pelle's strike curled inside his left-hand post . Southampton striker Graziano Pelle continued his scoring streak against Stoke City on Wednesday night . Stoke (4-2-3-1): Begovic 5.5; Bardsley 5.5, Shawcross 6, Wilson 6, Pieters 6; Cameron 5.5 (Adam 73 6), Nzonzi 5.5; Walters 5.5, Bojan 5 (Crouch 73 6), Arnatuovic 5; Diouf 6 . Unused subs: Sorensen (Gk), Muniesa, Ireland, Sidwell, Assaidi . Booked: Bardsley, Wilson, Adam, Crouch . Sent off: Crouch . Southampton (4-3-3): Forster 6; Clyne 6, Gardos 6 (Alderweireld 90), Fonte 6, Targett 6.5; Schneiderlin 6, S Davis 7.5 (Cork 90), Wanyama 7; Long 6.5, Pelle 6.5, Tadic 6.5 . Unused subs: K Davis (Gk), Yoshida, Bertrand, Mayuka, Reed Booked; Pelle, Fonte . Star man: Steven Davis . Referee: Lee Mason 6.5 . Attendance: 16,340 . That was all Southampton needed. Davis floated in a free-kick and without Crouch's 6ft 6ins presence there was panic in the Stoke ranks. The ball bounced off the waist of Erik Pieters and Graziano Pelle smashed the ball into the roof of the net for his second goal of the night and ninth of the season. 'Peter went high with his second challenge so there is always that risk when you are already on a yellow,' acknowledged Stoke manager Mark Hughes. 'It shows the emotion of a cup tie can get to even the most experienced players. Some of the wind went out of our sails. We didn't deal with the next ball into our own box and it fell to the last man we'd want.' Southampton, riding high in the Premier League, now have a winnable quarter-final at League One Sheffield United and Koeman, who won Euro '88 and the Champions League as a player, is dreaming of leading the club to their first major trophy since winning the FA Cup in 1976. 'We were much the better team on the pitch tonight,' he said. 'It was real cup football and Stoke made it a real battle when they brought Crouch on. It is one of their qualities. We don't have European football and this is the chance of a title. 'Stoke have had a bad fortnight with issues over grappling, diving and Bojan allegedly throwing his boots in the dressing-room. Bojan was given only his third start but Stoke started sluggishly and fell behind after six minutes when Pelle was given time and space to curl a 25-yard shot beyond Asmir Begovic. Worse was to follow for the home side. Steven Davis appeared close to the Stoke by-line and as he cut the ball back, three Stoke players inexplicably retreated into their own six-yard box while Long fired home unmarked from eight. It was Long's first Saints goal since his £12million move to Hull, whom he faces at the weekend. Stoke were booed off at half-time with Hughes admitting 'we lacked the intensity needed' but they threw themselves a lifeline three minutes after the restart when Steven Nzonzi took advantage of a retreating Southampton defence to shoot in from 18 yards. The visitors had chances to wrap the game up with Davies having a shot blocked by Ryan Shawcross and Long volleying over from Dusan Tadic's glorious pass. But when Hughes reverted to 'old Stoke' with 17 minutes left and sent on the cavalry in the form of Crouch and Charlie Adam – Bojan one of the players to make way – and the comeback looked on. Shane Long doubled Southampton's lead with a clinical strike in the 30th minute at the Britannia Stadium . Stoke keeper Asmir Begovic is beaten by a shot from Shane Long (left) of Southampton . Midfielder Steven Nzonzi gave Stoke a lifeline with a goal three minutes after the interval . Striker Mame Diouf (centre) scores Stoke's second goal in the 82nd minute against Southampton . Substitute Peter Crouch was shown a red card by referee Lee Mason for a second bookable offence . It wasn't exactly pretty. Adam's first act was to exact retribution on Saints midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin who had hurt Jonathan Walters in the first half. The Scot caught Schneiderlin on the back of the leg with a raking stud and the mild-mannered Koeman jumped up to protest. 'I said to the fourth referee that in my opinion it was a red card. He had no intention to play the ball. It was from behind,' he said. But Adam escaped with a yellow and supplied the 84th minute corner from which Mame Diouf headed Stoke's equaliser. Ironically, Shawcross had a part to play by gently nudging Florin Gardos out the way. From 2-2, Stoke should have completed a rousing victory. Instead, Crouch behaved idiotically and Hughes, who won the League Cup as a player with Manchester United, Chelsea and Blackburn Rovers, won't be getting his hands on the trophy this year.

"Ronny Deila looks forward to being able to field two different but equally capable Celtic teams. The Hoops boss has found to his cost that his squad is not as strong as he wants it to be, never more so than when he played Saturday's opponents Inverness earlier in the season. Ahead of the second leg of the Champions League qualifying play-off against Maribor at Parkhead in August - which they lost 1-0 following a 1-1 draw in Slovenia the previous week - the Norwegian made 10 changes for the trip to the Highlands in the Premiership and lost 1-0. Ronny Deila is looking forward to being able to field two different but equally capable Celtic teams . And following the 2-2 Europa League draw away to Salzburg the following month, Deila made six changes for the visit of Motherwell and dropped another two points in the 1-1 draw, bringing more criticism his way. It appeared that lessons have been learned following the home 2-1 Europa League win over Romanian outfit Astra Giurgiu just over a week ago, with Deila making only three changes for the league encounter against Kilmarnock at Parkhead which they won 2-0. Recalling the first game against Caley, the former Stromsgodset boss said: 'There are two things there. Hopefully within one year or two years, we can play those kind of teams and win. 'Two, there were too many changes. We had 10 changes in that game. It was a very important game we had in the Champions League afterwards so that was something we had to do. 'Against Motherwell we had five or six changes and the last time we had only three and we played better and won. 'We have to learn from this and try to develop everyone so we can play two different teams sometimes if we need to.'

Up there we made a few changes after a European game, this time at home we will be looking to win the game and get our own back for that one. 'I think they've done very well. Yogi (John Hughes) has changed the way they've been playing in the last few years. 'They've been passing the ball a lot more and they are quite an attractive team to watch. 'If they come here and look to do that again then there is a possibility they could cause us problems.' Much of the talk in the past week has been about the possibility of Celtic winning the domestic treble as well as the Europa League. However, Gordon is simply enjoying the prospect of success after his stint at Sunderland when avoiding relegation was treated as a positive achievement. He said: 'It makes a difference from the last four or five years when I was at Sunderland when any finish above the bottom three was considered a good season. 'I think being able to win trophies is something every player would rather do than be involved in a relegation scrap. 'You've got to go out and try to win every game. It's a different mentality than trying to win 10 games and a few draws to get enough points to see in you the league for another year.'","Celtic are currently fourth in the Scottish Premiership .

"Didier Drogba showed he's also the King of the court as Chelsea's players enjoyed a spot of basketball during training on Thursday. Drogba, who has scored three goals in his last three games for the Blues, looked a natural with the ball in his hands as he joined his team-mates for the lighthearted session ahead of their clash with Queens Park Rangers on Saturday. Unfortunately for some, the fun session was only for those players who had taken part in Chelsea's 2-1 Capital One Cup win against Shrewsbury Town on Tuesday night as the likes of Diego Costa were put through their paces elsewhere.

Chelsea sit top of the Premier League after an unbeaten start to the season, and have a six-point advantage over reigning champions Manchester City. Although he didn't take part in the small-sided basketball game, Costa looked in good condition as he trained with the rest of the squad. Costa's last Chelsea game saw him seal a 2-0 win against Arsenal, and the former Atletico Madrid striker will be hungry to add to his nine-goal tally so far. Mourinho, who revealed on Tuesday that Costa is ready to return, recently hinted that he believes Spain coach Vicente del Bosque is the man to blame for the centre forward's recent injury troubles. The 26-year-old began the season in prolific fashion but he has missed Chelsea's last three fixtures because of a persistent hamstring injury.

The former Atletico Madrid man had also been suffering from a cold in the build-up to last Sunday's match against Manchester United, but Mourinho revealed it was injury, rather than illness that ruled the £32million signing out of the match at Old Trafford. Costa has been troubled by the hamstring problem for some time, but Mourinho believes it was exacerbated by Spain coach Del Bosque fielding the player for back-to-back games against Slovakia and Luxembourg at the start of October. 'The virus is fine,' the Chelsea manager said. 'It was hard, he had to go to the hospital and obviously it doesn't help him to recover from his injury. But he didn't play on Sunday because of the injury, not because of the virus. 'Diego has the hamstring (problem) because he played two matches in three days when he was not with us.'

"Ryan Shawcross has remarkably been pulled off man-marking duties at corners and set-pieces as Stoke City attempt to shield him from the 'grappling' spotlight. The defender was named as a serial offender of penalty area 'dark arts' by former referee Graham Poll as we launched our 'Hands Off In The Box' campaign. Ten days ago Shawcross conceded a spot-kick after wrapping his arms around Wilfried Bony in Stoke 2-1 victory over Swansea but in the 1-0 defeat at Southampton on Saturday he was asked to mark zonally. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mark Hughes: Referees influenced by reputation of Ryan Shawcross . Ryan Shawcross (right) conceded a penalty against Swansea after grappling with Wilfried Bony (centre right) Shawcross has now been removed from man-marking duties at corners by Stoke boss Mark Hughes . HANDS OFF IN THE BOX is our new campaign to rid football of the dark arts of the penalty box. Whether it is wrestling, grappling, shirt pulling - or the outrageous headlocks witnessed in the Manchester United vs Chelsea match - the area has become a free-for-all for cheating. And that means fewer goals in the Barclays Premier League. For too long, referees have failed to punish players for blatantly stopping opponents from scoring. It's time to end that. So join us in our campaign to say Hands Off In The Box to players and referees. We'll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it. Referee Michael Oliver's decision to penalise the player appears to have had the required deterrent effect. Stoke admit they took action simply because they thought Shawcross's reputation could make him an easy target for other officials even if he did nothing wrong. Stoke assistant manager Mark Bowen said: 'It seemed as though Ryan was singled out. It was no doubt it was a penalty in the strict sense of the word because of what Ryan was doing. 'But you see it time and again at every game across the country and in Europe as well. Nothing happens. 'On Saturday — and it shouldn't happen like this — we tried to pull him out of the spotlight if you like. So instead of Ryan marking from a corner, we put him in an area where he could attack the ball in a more zonal area. 'That's not his game, he's not been brought up on that. But it comes to something where you've got to try and change your system of marking because you're worried the lad is getting targeted. 'He's our captain, one of our best headers of the ball. You want Ryan Shawcross to be marking their most dangerous player. Even if Ryan doesn't do a full grab but the referee is looking for him, you couldn't leave that to chance. It's at the detriment to us.' The increasing scourge of man-handling rivals at corners and set-pieces is blighting the game and players know they can get away with it. Chelsea pair John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic, who between them know every trick in the book, were caught by Manchester United's Marcus Rojo and Chris Smalling in the 1-1 draw at Old Trafford. Terry was so riled that he tweeted a complaint that he and Ivanovic had been 'double headlocked'. Referee Phil Dowd took no action. In his defence of Shawcross, Bowen then highlighted the other covert crimes committed in the box, as if that was some justification. Our campaign is to stamp out wrestling, grappling, man-handling, blocking and all the other cheating tactics used by professional footballers. Former Wales defender Bowen pointed the finger at Swansea pair Bony and Ashley Williams and claimed that they, too, should have been prevented from blocking tactics. Stoke defender Shawcross (right) tussles with Southampton forward Graziano Pelle (centre) Pelle (left) challenges Shawcross (right) in the air during Southampton's 1-0 win against Stoke at St Mary's . 'Is it just holding or is it when people are handing others off?' questioned Bowen. 'We looked at Swansea, they do two blocks on corners. Ashley Williams will stand there and as Wilfried Bony is running past he will turn and block the runner. 'I'm not having a go at Swansea, a lot of teams do it. But is that as cynical as holding? Of course it is. It's foul play but different clubs have different ways of gaining that little advantage.' Bowen is not the first to admit that coaches regard sneaky fouling in the area as a legitimate tactic. It is impossible for the referee and his assistants to spot who is pushing and it is not unusual to see several players on the ground as the ball flies into the area. Managers and coaches also know that it is highly unlikely a referee will start to award lots of penalties and/or issue several yellow cards so the offenders get away with it. Even Bowen did not attempt to deny Shawcross's misdemeanour against Bony. His gripe was that the player had been singled out for punishment on a day when there were others breaking the rules too. Shawcross (right) grabs the arm of Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko at the Etihad last season . Eagle-eyed Oliver acted while colleague Dowd either missed the fouls or chose to ignore them. 'You wonder if Michael Oliver was seriously looking for something in that area, Phil maybe had a more general picture let's say,' added Bowen. That inconsistency annoys managers and coaches and also prevents a change of behaviour. Bowen believes that the only way to alter the mindset is by an early avalanche of red cards. Losing players in games and to suspensions would be the immediate and unpopular result. Bowen added: 'The only possible way of eradicating it is if every single time it happens it's punished. That might take a significant amount of penalties for all sides throughout the league. 'Then in maybe two months' time or so, you would see a lot more goals because strikers would get first run on defenders.' No more pushing, but plenty more goals - Sportsmail would settle for that. John Terry, Chelsea captain . 'Me and Branislav Ivanovic were double headlocked at every corner.' Colin Pascoe, Liverpool assistant manager . 'Grappling. That is the new word is it? It is the referees' interpretation and we'll leave it to them. That's what the referees and the officials are paid for. They make decisions. So whatever they decide is grappling, or holding, it's in their hands really. Did I do it as player? No, I was a winger and didn't have to mark anyone.' Ian Wright, Ex-Arsenal striker . 'There should be an official specifically looking for holding in the box from set-pieces. It was like UFC in the United area.' Graham Poll, Former top referee . 'Hold or grapple and you can expect to be cautioned. Once fans, managers and — crucially — players accept it as normal, this campaign will have achieved its aims.' Martin Keown, Ex-Arsenal defender . 'Defenders are checking, blocking, holding, grappling, using force to foul opponents — and too often referees are allowing it to take place.' Micky Mellon, Shrewsbury Town manager . 'In a congested area how can you judge if someone's been blocked? It's part of the game and some people are good at it. It's football. A local Football League referee came in and he was asking me about it. 'Can you show me some blocking techniques?' That was great, he was trying to find ways of detecting it. The confusing thing for managers is that fouls outside the area are given as free-kicks, but the same won't be given as penalties. There has to be consistency.' And the readers of MailOnline... 'It's more infuriating because we never hear from the refs themselves. It's about time the refs were made to answer the media just like players.' Willdajack, Neath . 'To those saying if there was a clampdown every game would be littered with penalties, that would be true for a couple of weeks then it would stop. I've been watching football since the Sixties and the cheating behaviour in the penalty area now is the worst I've ever seen.'

"Rio Ferdinand is to consider withdrawing his support from future FA initiatives in the wake of his three-match ban for using the word ‘sket’ on Twitter — slang for a promiscuous girl or woman. The QPR defender, 35, is still furious after an FA commission found him guilty of misconduct for abusing another user of the social media platform on September 30. Some people in football believe Ferdinand is the victim of a witch-hunt. Queens Park Rangers defender Rio Ferdinand has been given a three-game suspension by the FA . Ferdinand has been charged for this tweet, made on September 1, for using the slang term 'sket' Some people believe Ferdinand has been the victim of a witch-hunt, and he may never work for the FA . VIDEO Ferdinand banned for Twitter taunt . Ferdinand was a member of FA chairman Greg Dyke’s commission that was set up to safeguard the future of the national game and has previously stated a desire to become England manager one day. That is all in jeopardy after the FA commission banned him for three games, fined him £25,000 and ordered the former England defender to attend an education programme. Although Ferdinand accepts that his response on social media to a tweet about his performances in a QPR shirt was inappropriate, other players have escaped FA scrutiny. Five days ago his Rangers team-mate Joey Barton accused Barcelona forward Neymar of being ‘Messi’s fluffer’ on Twitter. A ‘fluffer’ is a slang term used in the adult entertainment industry, but the FA’s disciplinary team have yet to call the midfielder to account. Ferdinand is active on social media, with 5.9million followers on his Twitter page and over 14,500 tweets . Joey Barton has yet to hear from the FA after referring to Barcelona's Neymar as Lionel Messi's 'fluffer' Harry Redknapp criticised Ferdinand's ban and believes footballers would be better off without Twitter . Barton also claimed that Oscar Pistorius ‘definitely intended to kill her (Reeva Steenkamp)’ in yet another outburst that has escaped FA punishment. Ferdinand, who is scheduled to miss QPR’s games against Chelsea, Manchester City and Newcastle, is still considering whether to appeal against the verdict. His manager Harry Redknapp criticised Ferdinand’s ban, which was at the same level as a red card for a two-footed tackle. Redknapp said: ‘The same as a two-footed challenge? No. If someone slags him off and he goes back and slags them off. It doesn’t equate. I genuinely don’t know what goes on on Twitter. It would save all the hassle if no-one was on Twitter.’","Queens Park Rangers defender Rio Ferdinand banned for three games .

"Read Joe Bernstein's match report from the Britannia . Ronald Koeman felt Southampton deserved the late winner from Graziano Pelle that sent them through to the quarter-finals of the Capital One Cup at the expense of Stoke. Saints looked in control at 2-0 up at half-time against the team they beat in the Premier League on Saturday, but the Potters fought back and levelled through Mame Biram Diouf with eight minutes remaining. Stoke appeared to be the more likely winners at that stage but Peter Crouch saw red for two yellow cards in less than a minute. Stoke keeper Asmir Begovic was helpless as Graziano Pelle's strike curled inside his left-hand post . Southampton striker Pelle continued his impressive run of form against Stoke City on Wednesday night . The second was for a foul on Steven Davis and, from the resulting free-kick, an error by Erik Pieters allowed Pelle to grab his second in the 88th minute. Koeman said: 'We played well. It was more difficult when they made it 1-2 after half-time. 'In the first half we scored two great goals and were much the better team on the pitch. They showed more character after half-time, real fight, but we created three big chances for the third and didn't take them. 'They were physical and brought Crouch in, and it's difficult to defend. It's not the way I like to play but that's Stoke. 'Maybe after the red card for Crouch we were a little lucky but we deserved to win, we had more chances than Stoke.' Shane Long celebrates with Morgan Schneiderlin after scoring to put Southampton 2-0 up against Stoke City . Substitute Peter Crouch was shown a red card by referee Lee Mason for a second bookable offence . Pelle has been a key figure in Southampton's run of nine wins in 10 games and took his tally for the season into double figures. 'Pelle is a great player and showed his qualities, not only scoring, but as a target man,' said Koeman. 'Little by little the players are learning how to play with Pelle. He's been a great signing for us. 'You can't always win the football way. Stoke made it very difficult and made it a battle in second half. But my team showed spirit. Even after the disappointment of going to 2-2, the feeling was positive on the bench. 'I had the possibility to change players and I was confident if it went to extra time.' Stoke boss Mark Hughes was frustrated by the result after seeing his side make amends for a lacklustre first-half display. 'We put in a huge effort in the second half,' he said. 'We needed to because in the first half we didn't really get anywhere near the intensity that I was hoping for in terms of making it a real cup tie. 'The difference with the second half was marked. It was a real effort and I thought the momentum was with us. 'At 2-2 I felt we were in the ascendancy and we could go on and possibly win it from a situation where at 2-0 down you think it's going to be very hard against a very good Southampton team.' Koeman argued Charlie Adam could have been sent off at 2-1 for a challenge on Morgan Schneiderlin that earned him a booking - one of seven shown by referee Lee Mason. Stoke striker Mame Biram Diouf (centre) scores Stoke's second goal against Southampton . Midfielder Steven Nzonzi gave Stoke a lifeline with a goal three minutes after the interval . Hughes felt Crouch was a little unfortunate to see two of those - with the first coming for a clash with Jose Fonte and the second the late challenge on Davis. 'I felt the first yellow card was a little bit harsh on Peter,' said Hughes. 'I think he made a genuine attempt to just try to get across the lad. Whether or not the referee thought he raised his arm, I don't know. 'The second one, he's miscontrolled it and in trying to retrieve the ball he's high. When you're on a yellow card, there's always a risk you're going to get another one if you go in with a challenge like that. 'We've lost him, and that took a bit of the wind out of our sails, and then we haven't dealt with a ball into our box.'

"Mario Balotelli was the wrong signing for Liverpool because he doesn't fit the club's style of play, says Michael Owen. Balotelli has struggled on Merseyside since his £16million move from Italian giants AC Milan - scoring just twice in 12 appearances and none in the Premier League. The 24-year-old is struggling to fill the gap left by Luis Suarez, and former Anfield favourite Owen believes Brendan Rodgers' philosophy is unnatural to Balotelli's game. Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli has been disappointing since his £16million summer switch from AC Milan . Michael Owen believes Balotelli (left) has struggled to adapt to Brendan Rodgers' philosophy at the club . Luis Suarez scored 31 Premier League goals for Liverpool under Brendan Rodgers last season . 'Balotelli is clearly a talented player, but he is not in the bracket of world-class strikers Liverpool need if they are to get near the levels of last season. 'You might argue that there are not too many around who are, but the biggest surprise for me when Liverpool signed Balotelli is that he was so clearly unsuited to Rodgers' preferred system,' he wrote in his column for the Daily Telegraph. 'When you favour a high-intensity, quick-pressing game you have to have your scouts hunting for players who will fit seamlessly into your formation, closing down defenders and covering all areas of the pitch. 'You know the you are never going to get another Suarez - that is impossible - but it is important to have someone who at least endeavours to make the same runs and works just as hard. Balotelli (centre) was on the scoresheet as Liverpool beat Swansea 2-1 in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday . 'Otherwise, as we seem to be seeing on a weekly basis at Anfield, the manager is is being forced to change his formation, compromising what worked so perfectly last season. 'It is strange that the new manager has such a clearly defined way of playing and yet some of his players recruited over the summer do not necessarily fit into it. 'With Balotelli, Liverpool not only took a risk in terms of whether the player would deliver on the pitch - and not get into any trouble off it - but also gambled that he would actually be able to make the transition tactically from what he is used to.

No details of the crash were immediately available. Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula also tweeted news of the athlete's death and said more information would be made available once he had spoken to the former world champion's family. Former 800m world champion and Olympic silver medallist Mbulaeni Mulaudzi has been killed in a car accident . No details of the crash were immediately available of the car crash that killed the 34-year-old in South Africa . Mulaudzi, who carried the South African flag in the opening ceremony at the Athens Olympics in 2004, won his silver medal at the same Games having picked up a Commonwealth gold in Manchester two years earlier. He won the 2009 world championship title in Berlin after suffering the disappointment of a semi-final exit in the Beijing Olympics a year earlier. Mulaudzi retired from athletics in 2013. Ian Harries, his coach between 2000-05, said last year: 'Though not the South African record holder for his event, he is regarded by many as our greatest 800 metres runner. 'He was very competitive, aggressive and a very tactically aware runner who thrived best over a fast race. He had incredible speed-strength endurance. 'Despite his somewhat shy exterior and being wary of too much media exposure I, personally, think of him as a true legend of the event,' added Harries.

"Didier Drogba looked particularly surprised to see Chelsea striker Diego Costa back in training after the £32million signing's injury lay-off. The 36-year-old has been deputising for Costa, who spent one night in hospital after a virus hampered his recovery from hamstring and groin injuries, with Loic Remy also sidelined. Costa has been absent from Chelsea's squad since representing Spain against Slovakia and Luxembourg earlier this month, which led Jose Mourinho to blame manager Vicente del Bosque. But the Chelsea squad looked giddy enough to have their main striker back ahead of the visit of Queens Park Rangers to Stamford Bridge on Saturday, and even tried their hand at basketball.

Costa's last Chelsea game saw the 26-year-old seal a 2-0 win against London rivals Arsenal, and the former Atletico Madrid striker will be hungry to add to his nine-goal tally so far. Mourinho's day may only be spoiled by the news that Spain manager Del Bosque insisted he will remain 'stubborn' over the selection of Costa. Mourinho blamed Costa's inclusion in Spain's Euro 2016 qualifiers earlier in October for his lay-off, but Del Bosque says he will not leave the striker out just to satisfy the Chelsea boss. 'In some things we are very flexible and in others stubborn, and in this we are stubborn,' says Del Bosque. 'I don't know if we are right or wrong, but if we hadn't called up Costa for the national team we'd definitely have been criticised for not having done so.'

"Aaron Lennon has played down fears he could be facing a lengthy spell on the sidelines after the Tottenham winger had to be replaced during the interval of his side's cup match against Brighton. Lennon, who captained Tottenham during the first half, took to Twitter to reveal his hamstring injury is not too serious. The 27-year-old wrote: 'Gutted to come off with slight hammy but should be OK in no time. Aaron Lennon was forced off at half-time after sustaining a hamstring injury against Brighton .

"Javier Mascherano has been chosen as Barcelona's player of the year, beating his Argentina captain and former World Player of the Year Lionel Messi to the title. Mascherano was the standout performer during a difficult season for the Catalan club, showing versatility to play in central defence and in a deep midfield role. Messi had won the award in three of the last four years, but relinquished the title for the 2013/14 season, the same season he lost the World Player of the Year title to Cristiano Ronaldo. Mascherano receives the award with the family of Aldo Rovira, the Barca member after whom it is named . The Argentine star has been a crucial part of Barcelona's squad since joining from Liverpool in 2010 . Mascherano expressed his thanks for the award, as well as vowing to continue his form for the rest of the current campaign. 'I thank all of you who voted for me to receive this prize,' Mascherano told the club's official website. 'We'll try to continue doing things as well as we have until now, with the same dedication while trying to stay faithful to what a club like this demands, which is a lot.' The award is voted for by key members of the Catalan media as welll as top club officials, including the club's president Josep Maria Bartomeu, who said Mascherano was the unanimous winner. Mascherano joined the club as a holding midfielder but has largely been used at centre half over the past year . Lionel Messi has won three of the previous four awards, but lost out to his international team-mate . 'I was part of the jury that chose Javier Mascherano,' said Bartomeu explained. 'And I have to tell you, Javier, that there was quite some debate at first. 'But when your name came up, the response was unanimous and so this a very well deserved prize. 'It's an honour for Barca to have a player like you.'","Javier Mascherano unanimous choice for the jury .

"Manchester City are 'really struggling' right now and Manuel Pellegrini could find himself sacked if he fails to turn his club's fortunes around soon, believes Rodney Marsh. Wednesday's 2-0 home defeat to Newcastle United in the Capital One Cup - a trophy which Pellegrini lifted last season - ensured City have failed to win in three matches. They sit six points behind leaders Chelsea in the Premier League and face bitter rivals Manchester United in the derby on Sunday before a crunch clash with CSKA Moscow in the Champions League next Wednesday. Manchester City's Willy Caballero and Eliaquim Mangala are deflated as Newcastle United fans do the Poznan . Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko look deflated at the restart as the holders were  dumped out of Capital One Cup . Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini is under pressure having failed to win any of the last three games . And Marsh, who scored 36 goals in 118 league appearances for City, is adamant Chilean Pellegrini could soon find himself following in the footsteps of ex-manager Roberto Mancini, who lost his job just a season after lifting the title. Marsh told TalkSport: 'I think he (Pellegrini) will get the sack. There is every chance if this carries on that Pellegrini will be out the same as Mancini was. 'If Pellegrini carries on like this, and Man City don't win the league or get to the final at least of the Champions League, I think Pellegrini is sacked.' Interestingly, it is not just the terrible run of results that worries former England international forward Marsh, but also the poor form shown by Pellegrini's squad.

Moussa Sissoko (centre) doubles Newcastle's lead by slotting the ball past goalkeeper Willy Caballero . The Sky Blues threw away a two-goal lead in Moscow last week to draw 2-2 with CSKA and then lost 2-1 against West Ham United at Upton Park on Saturday. 'Man City have got loads of world class players that, apart from David Silva and Sergio Aguero, are all playing ordinary football at the same time,' he continued. 'When you have that, it doesn't matter how brilliant the players are, if you are not pulling in the same direction you are going to struggle. 'I heard this morning that they are the oldest squad of players in the whole of the Premier League and, at the moment, I think City are really struggling.'

"Colombia defender Mario Yepes insists that Real Madrid star James Rodriguez could challenge Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi for this year's Ballon d'Or. Rodriguez has been named on the 23-man shortlist after a brilliant World Cup campaign with Colombia and a big money move from Monaco to Madrid in the summer. Although the 23-year-old is yet to reach the goalscoring heights of Ronaldo or Messi, Yepes is confident his compatriot is showing why Madrid paid upwards of £60million for his talents.

"West Brom head coach Alan Irvine believes Georgios Samaras' Greece snub can benefit the Baggies. The striker has been axed by Greece for their Euro 2016 qualifier with the Faroe Islands and friendly with Serbia next month. He has struggled to make an impact at The Hawthorns since a free transfer from Celtic in the summer and has paid the price with Greece. Georgios Samaras is yet to make an impression at West Brom after signing on a free from Celtic . But, ahead of Saturday's trip to Leicester, Irvine believes it will give the hitman the chance to regain his fitness. 'It will give us an opportunity to work with him. It'll give us an opportunity that we had with the likes of Sebastian Blanco,' he said. 'From our point of view it is a good thing. Hopefully from Sammy's point of view, ultimately, it's a good thing. I'm sure he'll be bitterly disappointed not to be in the squad because he's the captain.' Samaras has been snubbed from Greece's next two games in November . The 29-year-old is yet to start this term after playing in the summer's World Cup meant he was behind on his fitness. Irvine said: 'He's not been ready, he's not been fit enough. I have said all along if you miss pre-season life is very difficult. It's difficult to get fit when other players are doing sessions as you are making sure they are doing the right levels. 'Sammy didn't do a pre-season, he had the World Cup which meant he was having his rest when everyone else was working. The West Brom forward has been a mainstay in the Greece set-up before his move to The Hawthorns . 'Other players who missed pre-season were able to top up but he would have spent previous international breaks preparing for games rather than getting ready. 'He needs to get to the right level physically. He has to get the most out of every training session he can.' Jonas Olsson is still sidelined with an Achilles problem while Silvestre Varela is out for the weekend after groin surgery but did return to training on Thursday. 'Only Jonas Olsson did not train, everyone else did including Silvestre. It was his first full session since coming back from injury,' Irvine added. 'We are very pleased with that but he is still a long way away from being able to play in the Premier League.'","The striker has been axed from Greece's next Euro 2016 qualifier .

"Swansea defender Federico Fernandez has had his red card against Liverpool in midweek rescinded. The Argentinian centre-back was shown a straight red card by referee Keith Stroud for a tackle on Philippe Coutinho during stoppage-time in the 2-1 Capital One Cup defeat at Anfield. The tackle was deemed as serious foul play and Fernandez faced a three-match ban, starting with Saturday's Barclays Premier League trip to Everton. Swansea won their appeal against the red card given to Federico Fernandez against Liverpool . Fernandez challenges Phillipe Coutinho in an earlier piece of play before the tackle which saw him sent off . Swansea appealed against the decision with a written statement and video evidence and a Football Association appeals panel overturned the red card on Thursday afternoon. A club statement said: 'Swansea City can confirm that the Football Association has rescinded the red card shown to defender Federico Fernandez against Liverpool in midweek.' Swansea manager Garry Monk had expressed his disappointment at the decision to send off Fernandez, the fourth round tie standing at 1-1 with extra-time beckoning before Liverpool defender Dejan Lovren made the most of the visitors being reduced to 10 men with a 95th-minute winner. Balotelli scores a late equaliser for Liverpool against Swansea City in the Capital One Cup last-16 match .

'Hopefully the referee will see some sense and the authorities will rescind that red card, because it wasn't a red card at all. 'It's an honest challenge. If anything, Coutinho's feet were higher than ours and actually went in over the top of our player. 'I don't quite see how the referee saw that, but hopefully he sees sense and rescinds it.'

"CLICK HERE to see all the stats from the game at White Hart Lane. To the relief of Mauricio Pochettino, he has discovered some players who are comfortable with the pitch dimensions at White Hart Lane. As excuses for points failure in the Barclays Premier League go, his moan about the playing surface is right up there with the best of them. Like his team, he can do better than that. Fortunately for Tottenham's coach, the conditions at White Hart Lane suit Erik Lamela and Harry Kane. These two could play on anything. Lamela came on as substitute at half-time, replacing captain Aaron Lennon and steering his team into the Capital One Cup quarter-finals with a beaut off his right boot.

Manager: Sami Hyypia 6.5 . Referee: Mark Clattenburg 7 . *Match ratings by Neil Ashton at White Hart Lane . Boy did they need him to win this clash against a robust and resilient Brighton team. Lamela, he of Rabona fame, is a class act, even if he did incur the wrath of his manager after emerging from a toilet cubicle just before the start of the second half. 'I was angry because we knew Lennon couldn't continue so I wanted Lamela on. After that he went to the toilet and he came out late.' He was standing upright when he danced into the penalty area, putting Spurs ahead against their tricky, Championship opponents. Kane added another, following up his hat-trick here in last week's Europa League clash against Asteras Tripolis. 'Harry, Harry give us a wave,' demanded the Tottenham fans in the Park Lane stand when he was substituted towards the end of this nervy affair. He responded, reluctantly. He seems like a nice chap. Lamela, who put Spurs in front eight minutes after the break, has scored three times this season. All of them a have been on home soil. He used his magic boots to finish off the sweetest of moves, a one-two with Roberto Soldado, to inch Tottenham ahead against Sami Hyypia's side. Next they will face Newcastle, the team who beat them 2-1 here last Sunday to prompt Pochettino's outburst about the size of the pitch here at White Hart Lane. It is complete bunkum of course, an excuse for three defeats suffered by this Spurs team in the Barclays Premier League this season. Instead they have the familiar Spurs feel, a Cup team again as they limp past Nottingham Forest and Brighton in this competition and make headway in the Europa League. This is a nervy Tottenham team, living on edge after defeats here against Liverpool, West Brom and Newcastle.

They have some making up to do with the fans who have been waiting for this club to take off under Daniel Levy's stewardship for more than a decade. The wait goes on. When this team hasn't scored after five minutes you can sense the confidence seeping out of the side. Patience guys. Soon it spreads into the stands and before you know it they are putting their knuckles in their mouths at half-time to stop themselves booing their team. It another close call here at 0-0. To listen to Brighton's army of fans, the thousands who made it up from the south coast, chanting 'ole' towards the end of the first half would have got on their goat.

Brighton's Adam Chicksen (right) is put under pressure by Tottenham full back Kyle Naughton (left) at White Hart Lane . Referee Mark Clattenburg takes charge of his first game since being relieved of his Premier League duties for the coming weekend . Mark Clattenburg was tap-dancing when Brighton defender Inigo Calderon and Spurs striker Harry Kane began grappling inside the area after ten minutes. Kane claimed he had been thrown to the deck by Calderon, who began wagging his finger in the striker's face, and demanded a penalty. Not given. They were stirred by Michel Vorm, in goal for Hugo Lloris, bizarrely booting the ball out for an early corner after a communication mix-up with Vertonghen. Speak to each other guys, speak. Spurs had a couple of decent chances, but Christian Walton's debut will be remembered in his household for an awful long time. The Brighton keeper, who is also in the England Under-19 squad, was outstanding in the first half. His saves from Jan Vertonghen, getting down early to save a long range effort, and stopping Andros Townsend's angled effort were top drawer. Good for him. 'Chris will remember this night for the rest of his life,' admitted Hyypia. 'Our first choice David Stockdale and a problem with his finger and Chris knew in morning that he would play. It is not an easy place to play. When we needed him he did his job very well.' Brighton had a shout for a penalty in the first half when Kyle Naughton appeared to handle, but referee Mark Clattenburg ignored the appeals. They had a couple of first half chances, but Kazenga LuaLua misjudged the best of them when he was put clean through down the left. The ball skidded off the surface and the Brighton forward lashed a left foot effort high into the stands. It will eat away at him. Danny Holla's dreamy effort, a free kick from 25 yards out, dipped over Vorm's crossbar. It was only after the break when the tie moved in Tottenham's favour after Lennon, nursing a hamstring injury, was replaced by Lamela. Eight minutes into the second half he combined brilliantly with Soldado, combing their way through the Brighton defence to set up the opener. Lamela read the pass and he darted into the penalty area before sliding the ball underneath Walton. It was a superb move.

Brighton striker Adrian Colunga (right) attempts to avoid the outstretched leg of Vertonghen (left) Kane, who scored three here last week and was dropped for last Sunday's defeat against Newcastle, finished off Brighton from close range. Townsend set up Soldado and when his shot was blocked, Kane was there to pounce. That's seven for the season, all in cup competition. That put Spurs two up and even Clattenburg felt like the job was down for Spurs. Clattenburg, the man who took off from the Hawthorns last Saturday to make sure he made it to an Ed Sheeran concert in time, blew up before the injury time was done.

City manager Manuel Pellegrini's tactic of fielding strong teams in the competition that gave him his first English trophy last season is generally admirable. On Wednesday night, though, it began to look a little reckless as Silva limped off after five minutes with a knee problem and Yaya Toure exited on the hour with a tight groin. Pellegrini admitted this week that he smiled when United's Robin van Persie scored an equaliser against Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League at the weekend. Well, now it was Louis van Gaal's turn. The United manager will head east across town on Sunday with more confidence than previously he might. Certainly City were poor against an admirably ambitious Newcastle side. Young forward Rolando Aarons scored the first goal in just the sixth minute and there could have been a couple more before substitute Moussa Sissoko shimmied through for one of the goals of the season with 15 minutes left. Pellegrini continues to do his best to appear sanguine. His team, he says, are no better or worse than they were this time last season. The statistics, though, are unpleasant. Not only have City won just six of their fifteen games in all competitions this season, they are now on a three-match winless run for the second time in a season that is less than three months old. To place this in proper context, this didn't happen at all last season. Indeed the last time it did prior to this campaign was February 2013. So what does this all add up to? A heap of bad news and bad omens ahead of Sunday, that's for sure. In all likelihood, Premier League leaders Chelsea will be nine points clear of City by the time the derby commences and Pellegrini can only hope improvement arrives quickly.

CSKA MOSCOW (H), CHAMPIONS LEAGUE, (H) - Wednesday, November 5 . QUEENS PARK RANGERS (A), PREMIER LEAGUE, Saturday, November 8 . Mangala hauls down Newcastle's Paul Dummett in the box - further proof for Sportsmail's Hands Off In The Box campaign . Evidence at last, perhaps, that even the most determined grapple tackle doesn’t always work. With just over half an hour gone, City’s burly central defender Eliaquim Mangala had Paul Dummett virtually in a headlock as a corner came in. Referee Stuart Attwell and his assistants missed the offence — goodness knows how — but Dummett managed to get off the floor in time to volley a shot in to goalkeeper Willy Caballero’s shins. If City were a little unfortunate to lose at West Ham last weekend, they were not here. Against a Newcastle team that hadn't beaten them in 17 attempts and that contained six new players following Sunday's surprise win at Tottenham, they were pretty wretched in all areas of the field and could really have lost by more. Newcastle were brave and progressive but still limited. They played very well and it is hard not to feel pleased for manager Alan Pardew given all he has been through in recent times. City, though, began badly, gifted Newcastle a goal and never really recovered. Only a minute or so had passed following Silva's injury – caused accidentally by Newcastle's Ryan Taylor – when City midfielder Fernandinho gave the ball away in midfield and England Under 20 star Aarons raced clear to slide a shot between the legs of reserve goalkeeper Willy Caballero. Caballero could have done better. He looked indecisive as Aarons advanced. The mistake was Fernandinho's, though. The Brazilian did the same thing in the World Cup semi-final against Germany. This time the stakes were rather lower but the error just as rudimentary. City did manage to rouse themselves a little and played some relatively progressive football as they chased the game. There were two chances for Stevan Jovetic in the first half while Newcastle defender Fabricio Coloccini sliced a clearance against his own post. Newcastle, though, should have been at least one more goal better off by half-time. Paul Dummett volleyed a chance from a corner against Caballero's legs just after the half hour while young centre forward Adam Armstrong almost slid a Daryl Janmaat cross in at the near post in the 45th minute. In to the second half and Newcastle for a time looked as though they would be undone by poor decisions by referee Stuart Attwell. Due to return to the Premier League after a two year absence this weekend, Attwell will hope to have a better game than he did here. His decision not to award Newcastle a penalty when Aleksandar Kolarov scythed down the breaking Gabriel Obertan in the 68th minute represented as big a blunder as anything committed by those in sky blue. Kolarov should have been sent off, too, and these injustices could have derailed Newcastle as Pellegrini threw on Sergio Aguero and chased the game hard. As it was, Sissoko wrapped up his team's unlikely victory in the 75th minute, throwing the hapless Fernandinho an outrageous dummy on the edge of the penalty area, surging past Bacary Sagna and beating Caballero across his body with a toe poke in to the far corner. Fabricio Coloccini goes in hard on City substitute Samir Nasri, who featured for the first time since his injury .

It was a superb goal that capped Newcastle's wonderful night. Twice City went close at the death but by then it all looked a bit desperate. In truth, they perhaps did themselves a favour. Extra-time would have done them no good at all. 'We are not playing well, we are in a difficult moment with a lack of trust,' said Pellegrini afterwards. 'We conceded two easy goals. There is a lack of confidence which we must change as soon as possible. 'We are not playing as fast as we can, as freely as a team. I am worried about how we are playing but we can improve.'

"David Moyes was shocked to be handed the managerial position at Manchester United, according to his former Everton player Leon Osman. Moyes signed a six-year contract at Old Trafford after receiving a call from Sir Alex Ferguson in 2013 - only to be sacked 11 months later as United limped to their lowest-ever Premier League finish. In extracts from his autobiography published in the Liverpool Echo, Osman revealed: ‘After it was confirmed, Moyes called six of the senior players to meet him in the Thistle Hotel in Haydock – myself, Nev (Phil Neville), Jags (Phil Jagielka), Hibbo (Tony Hibbert), Bainesy (Leighton Baines) and Tim Howard. Leon Osman was pleased for David Moyes after his Everton manager revealed he was leaving for United . Moyes was handed the Old Trafford top job after being called to Sir Alex Ferguson's house . Scotsman Moyes was sacked after 11 months in charge following dismal results . ‘We all congratulated him and told him he had earned a move like that for all his effort and what he’d done for the club. He sat us down and told us it wasn’t planned but that he’d received a phone call from Sir Alex, who asked to meet him and then told him he wanted him to be the next manager of Man United. ‘Moyesy looked us straight in the eyes and told us he hadn’t expected the offer. I absolutely believe what he told us. For me, he ran his contract down so it was easier to get offers like that but I genuinely don’t believe he had United on his mind.’ Moyes walks out to a standing ovation on his final match as Toffees manager at Goodison Park . Former Everton forward Tim Cahill grabbed a share of the limelight during Moyes' and Phil Neville's send off . Osman also disclosed how the former Everton manager's final game at Goodison Park was slightly overshadowed by Australian forward Tim Cahill getting in on the act. ‘He was given a fantastic send-off by our fans and it was really fitting. ‘Our manager who has been there for 11 years (came out on to the pitch after Phil Neville who was retiring). That should have been it but who comes on the pitch last? Tim Cahill! I just couldn’t believe it. It was incredible. ‘Tim should have declined the offer in my opinion. He’d been unbelievable for Everton, one of the best signings ever, but that was Nev and Moyesy’s moment and not his.","Leon Osman reveals details of David Moyes' departure in his autobiography .

"Spanish part-timers Cornella can look forward to a visit to the Bernabeu in December but it will be strictly tourism in the capital after Real Madrid all but confirmed their passage into the Copa del Rey quarter-finals with a convincing win in Wednesday night’s first leg. Cornella’s 27-year-old journeyman centre forward Oscar Munoz, whose career has taken him to 14 clubs, scored a memorable first-half goal but it was not enough to keep the tie alive. Third-tier side Cornella – led by captain and dentist David Garcia – gave a good account of themselves in the first half but conceded twice from corners scored by Real’s France centre back Rafael Varane and were taken apart in the second half as the Cup holders got into their stride. Real Madrid defender Raphael Varane leaps above Cornella's defence to score against Copa del Rey opponents Cornella . Cornella striker Munoz (left) scored a shock equaliser in the 20th minute but the underdogs did not stay on level terms for long . Varane doubled his tally for the night by beating Cornella goalkeeper Jose Manuel to the ball . UD Cornella: Manuel, Marin, Marti, Pelegri (Tapia 57), Tobella, Garcia, Gomez, Plazuelo (Gallar 58), Caballe, Xemi (Gaudioso 72), Munoz. Subs not used: Alberto, Boniquet. Goal: Munoz 20 . Real Madrid: Navas, Arbeloa, Varane, Nacho, Carvajal, Khedira, Illarramendi, Isco (Tomas 77), Rodriguez (Marcelo 61), Hernandez, Benzema (Medran 77). Subs not used: Pacheco, Romero. Goals: Varane 10, 36, Hernandez 53, Marcelo 75 . That will not take the shine off the second leg but it will be a night for swapping shirts and taking in the sights as opposed to repeating the heroics of third division side Alcorcon in the 2009 season, who they knocked Manuel Pellegrini’s Real Madrid out of the competition at this stage. Real never looked in trouble here. They scored on 10 minutes when a corner from James Rodriguez was headed in by Varane. Cornella were on level terms 10 minutes later when Muñoz took advantage of indecision in the Madrid defence to beat Keylor Navas for the equaliser. But the dream died on 36 minutes when Varane got on the end of another corner, this time from Isco, to head Madrid in front. In the second half Javier Hernandez scored Madrid’s third with a cross shot leaving Jose Segovia in the minnows’ goal helpless. Playing at Espanyol’s stadium because their own ground holds only 1,500 fans, Cornella had effectively lost home advantage and although Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti left Cristiano Ronaldo resting back in the capital along with Iker Casillas, Sergio Ramos and Luka Modric there was still enough talent on display to see off Cornella with Rodriguez controlling things in midfield. Hernandez could and should have got the fourth from Isco’s pass but couldn’t reach the midfielder’s pass at the back post. Marcelo came on as a second half substitute in place of Rodriguez and with a licence to play further forward took full advantage by getting on the scoresheet to make it 4-1. Isco’s shot was saved by Segovia and Marcelo fired the rebound into the roof of the keeper’s net. There were somersaults in his celebration for his 20th career goal for Madrid. The rest of Spain’s last-16 cup games will be played in December but with Madrid off to compete in the World Club Cup later that month they have been given special dispensation to play their first leg early. Sevilla, who they will play in a rearranged league match when the rest of Spain plays its first leg ties, were also allowed to bring forward their match.

"Celtic have vowed to appeal a seven match ban handed to Aleksandar Tonev after he was found guilty of racially abusing Aberdeen's Shay Logan. The Bulgarian winger, who is on loan at Parkhead from Aston Villa, was hit with the punishment following a five-hour disciplinary hearing at Hampden on Thursday. Tonev and Logan were direct opponents during a 2-1 win for Celtic over Aberdeen at Parkhead in September when Englishman Logan told referee Bobby Madden the Bulgarian had called him a 'black c***'. Aleksandar Tonev (centre) has been found guilty of using racist language towards Shay Logan (right) Celtic assistant manager John Collins accompanied the Bulgarian midfielder to his hearing on Thursday . The defender also reported the alleged incident to his captain, Mark Reynolds, and Aberdeen boss McInnes. Tonev vehemently denied the allegation but was hit with an SFA charge and was accompanied to yesterday's hearing by Celtic assistant boss John Collins. Tonev left Hampden without comment but Celtic later released a statement, insisting they accepted Tonev is not a racist and that they would fight his corner. Celtic have backed Tonev and deny that he is a racist, despite the outcome of the disciplinary hearning . Collins and Tonev leave Hampden after hearing the result, but the club have insisted they will appeal . A Celtic spokesperson said: 'Racism has no place in football and as a club for all people, Celtic absolutely abhors racism of any kind. 'This was a very unfortunate case, but the Club has accepted Aleksandar's explanation that he did not say the words that were alleged to have been said and that he is not a racist. 'We are, therefore, very disappointed by the outcome today and can confirm that Aleksandar will be appealing this decision.'","Celtic winger Aleksandar Tonev had denied the allegations .

"He won six league titles, three European Cups and scored more goals for Real Madrid in the Champions League than any player has scored for any club and this week Spain has been marking the passing of 20 years since he made his debut. Raul Gonzalez Blanco was picked to start against Zaragoza on October 29 1994, in La Romareda and never looked back scoring 323 goals in the famous white shirt in 741 games. He also played 102 times for Spain scoring 44 goals. The records will eventually tumble. His Spain milestone has already been passed by David Villa and Cristiano Ronaldo will surely go beyond his goals tally. Sergio Ramos and Iker Casillas could easily topple his appearances record and the Champions League landmark of 71 goals is currently being scrapped over by Ronaldo and Lionel Messi but however many records are rubbed out, his legacy will endure. VIDEO Scroll down as Raul scores for Real Madrid then hands Cristiano Ronaldo his shirt . Raul won six league titles, three European Cups and scored the most Champions League goals for Real Madrid .

Sir Alex Ferguson described him as the best player in the world after one masterclass against Manchester United and he took levels of professionalism to new lengths when towards the end of his career at Real Madrid the club provided him with a special room in his house that recreated conditions of altitude to help athletes recover more quickly from matches. ‘It’s like sleeping in the mountains in Madrid. Not everybody who sleeps in the mountains is a great sportsman but it all helps. The key is to be the best prepared possible and that is my commitment to the club,’ he told Sportsmail in an exclusive interview in 2009, coincidentally the last time Real played Liverpool in the Champions League. Raul finally checked out of Madrid the season Jose Mourinho turned up but that was not the end of his career. Raul (left) during his Real Madrid debut against Zaragoza on October 29 in La Romareda in 1994 . Sir Alex Ferguson described him as the world's best player after a masterclass against Manchester United . Many would have opted straight for the lucrative swansong in a money-spinning club in the Far East but Raul went to ply his trade for two seasons in the Bundesliga with Schalke and he loved every minute of it. ‘I know a lot of marathon runners who are at their best when they are close to 40. You say to yourself, “It’s 42 kilometres and they are 37 or 38 years old”, but the body can! What you have to make sure you don’t lose is your head. That is the most important thing,’ he said of his time at Schalke that included a Champions League semi-final back at Old Trafford. Above all Raul the player was a survivor. He made it through 17 years at Real – often the only homegrown player in a sea of Galatico signings. He then survived the rigours of German football at a time when other players would have had their feet up. ‘I am getting so much out of my time here - it’s just a shame that you would need three or four lives to experience everything you want to in football - in England or in North America. It makes the life of a player richer when you throw yourself into these things,’ he toldSportsmail in another  exclusive interview when at Schalke. Now as he prepares for a new chapter at New York Cosmos the story goes on and rightly so this week Spain remembers him 20 years after he kicked his first ball in anger at the Bernabeu.

Cardiff’s Malaysian billionaire owner ordered a £750,000 investigation into eight transfers after sacking Mackay as his manager last year; an investigation conducted by leading fraud and sports lawyers at London firm Mishcon de Reya and one that uncovered the racist, homophobic and sexist text and email exchanges between Mackay and former head of recruitment Iain Moody.

Blatter, who was on a visit to Moscow for the unveiling of Russia's official World Cup emblem, made the comments following calls to move the 2018 tournament to a different country due to Russia's conflict with Ukraine. 'A boycott never achieves anything and does not have a positive effect. FIFA is fully supporting the World Cup in Russia,' said the 78-year-old in an interview given to ITAR-news and R-Sport. Sepp Blatter (left) talks with Vladimir Putin (right) at FIFA's World Cup emblem unveiling . Blatter insisted that football should be kept separate from politics and that the World Cup would stay in Russia . The FIFA 2018 logo for the Russian World Cup was released on Tuesday evening . The official logo was presented on the facade of the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow . 'When we received letters from North America, we answered that this is football. We believe in the country (Russia) and their government. 'The mass media should help us with this. We have experienced such things in the past at the Sochi Olympics. However, during and after the (Winter) Games there was not one bad word written about the event. 'You know, Russia is in the focus of the world press. Football cannot only unite Russia, but can also show the whole world that it is stronger than any protest movement,' he said. Putin shows Blatter a model of the Luzhniki stadium, and Russia's preparations are on schedule . According to Blatter, 'a boycott never achieves anything and does not have a positive effect' Russia and Ukraine might be put into different groups at the 2018 World Cup finals if the Ukrainians qualify and relations between the two countries do not improve, FIFA said on Tuesday. However, FIFA denied a comment attributed to President Sepp Blatter, who was quoted by the R-Sport agency as saying 'you can be sure about this' in reply to a question about whether the two countries would be kept apart. 'The President did not say that they would be kept apart or that such a decision has been made. It seems (there was) a translation mistake,' said FIFA in a statement. Blatter also refused to consider scrapping the third-place playoff, despite complaints from some teams . Holland came third in Brazil after beating the hosts in what is usually considered to be a meaningless match . 'What the FIFA president actually said was that, in any qualifying campaign, the aim is always to avoid problems as was done in the past between teams where high tensions can be anticipated. 'On Ukraine/Russia situation, he said that we have to see how this evolves but, if the geopolitical situation were to remain as it is now, when it comes to the final competition then FIFA could decide that the respective teams would not be in the same group.' Blatter said he was pleased with Russia's preparations for the tournament. Blatter praised Russia for being in a better position at this stage than the previous World Cup, won by Germay . 'In comparison with Brazil's preparations for the 2014 World Cup, Russia is well ahead of them with four years to go.' He also said the third place playoff will be kept despite calls from teams to abolish it. 'We will not be getting rid of it. It's very important. If there was no third place playoff then the head of (European body) UEFA, Michel Platini, would never have taken home a bronze medal. These games are always well fought,' the Swiss said.

"HANDS OFF IN THE BOX is our new campaign to rid football of the dark arts of the penalty box. Whether it is wrestling, grappling, shirt pulling - or the outrageous headlocks witnessed in the Manchester United vs Chelsea match - the area has become a free-for-all for cheating. And that means fewer goals in the Barclays Premier League. For too long, referees have failed to punish players for blatantly stopping opponents from scoring. It's time to end that. So join us in our campaign to say Hands Off In The Box to players and referees. We’ll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it. Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini has added his voice to Sportsmail's campaign to stop the amount of fouls that take place in penalty boxes across the Premier League. The Hands Off In The Box campaign aims to rid football of the dark arts in the penalty area. Acts such as wrestling, grappling and shirt pulling are now commonplace, as was so shockingly illustrated in the 1-1 draw between Manchester United and Chelsea on Sunday as Marcos Rojo and Chris Smalling manhandled John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic respectively to the ground in brutal fashion. Both United defenders went unpunished. And the Manchester City manager has revealed that he shares the concerns that many have over the amount of blatantly stopping opponents from scoring. 'When the Premier League managers met [with referees] at the start of the season, this was one of the things we talked about,' he said. 'We said that that there was a lot going on and that were a lot of penalties [not being given]. 'It is definitely something that happens and it is very hard for the referees. 'Equally, there are lots of fouls of goalkeepers – where the goalkeeper is not being allowed to move – and that is a problem also.' But Sportsmail feels that enough is enough. It's time referees and assistants eradicated bodychecking and wrestling inside the box, just as tackles from behind have been, and reckless challenges are in the process of being now. Guilty defenders must be named and shamed - if everyone knows who the cheats are, referees will have no excuse not to punish serial offenders.

Martin Skrtel (second left) grabs hold of Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker's shirt at a set piece in February . John Terry, Chelsea captain . ‘Me and Branislav Ivanovic were double headlocked at every corner.’ Colin Pascoe, Liverpool assistant manager . ‘Grappling. That is the new word is it? It is the referees’ interpretation and we’ll leave it to them. That’s what the referees and the officials are paid for. They make decisions. So whatever they decide is grappling, or holding, it’s in their hands really. Did I do it as player? No, I was a winger and didn’t have to mark anyone.’ Ian Wright, Ex-Arsenal striker . ‘There should be an official specifically looking for holding in the box from set-pieces. It was like UFC in the United area.’ Graham Poll, Former top referee . ‘Hold or grapple and you can expect to be cautioned. Once fans, managers and — crucially — players accept it as normal, this campaign will have achieved its aims.’ Martin Keown, Ex-Arsenal defender . ‘Defenders are checking, blocking, holding, grappling, using force to foul opponents — and too often referees are allowing it to take place.’ Micky Mellon, Shrewsbury Town manager . ‘In a congested area how can you judge if someone’s been blocked? It’s part of the game and some people are good at it. It’s football. A local Football League referee came in and he was asking me about it. “Can you show me some blocking techniques?” That was great, he was trying to find ways of detecting it. The confusing thing for managers is that fouls outside the area are given as free-kicks, but the same won’t be given as penalties. There has to be consistency.’ And the readers of MailOnline... ‘It’s more infuriating because we never hear from the refs themselves. It’s about time the refs were made to answer the media just like players.’ Willdajack, Neath . ‘To those saying if there was a clampdown every game would be littered with penalties, that would be true for a couple of weeks then it would stop. I’ve been watching football since the Sixties and the cheating behaviour in the penalty area now is the worst I’ve ever seen.’ Sir Miles Platting, Manchester .","Sportsmail has launched a campaign to rid football of the dark arts in the penalty area: HANDS OFF IN THE BOX .

"Newcastle United recorded a night to remember on Wednesday as Alan Pardew's side earned a place in the Capital One Cup quarter-finals after a 2-0 win against Manchester City. Goals from Rolando Aarons and Moussa Sissoko ensured the win for the Magpies against a City side which started with Yaya Toure, David Silva and Edin Dzeko. Here, Sportsmail's Craig Hope gives his verdict on how the players performed at the Etihad. Rolando Aarons (centre) wheels away in celebration after his early goal against Manchester City . MANCHESTER CITY: (4-2-3-1) Willy Caballero 5.5 . Nutmegged for the opener and beaten quite easily for the second, did little to press claims for a run in the team. Bacary Sagna 5.5 . Done all ends up for Sissoko’s excellent second and did not get to grips with Aarons all night. Martin Demichelis 5.5 . Dithered when presented with one glorious first-half chance to level. Eliaquim Mangala 5 . Clumsy – he looks anything but a £30million Premier League centre back. Aleksandar Kolarov 5.5 . Struggled to contain Obertan at times and didn’t offer a great deal in attack. Should have been sent off for trip on Obertan in area. Yaya Toure (centre) struggled to make an impact against a spirited Newcastle midfield . James Milner 6 . A frustrating night, he tried his best to make things happen but it just didn’t come off. Yaya Toure (off 59) 5.5 . Just did not impact his superiority yet again, especially against young opponents. Fernandinho 5 . Was guilty of dawdling in possession at the cost of the opening goal. Fernandinho was caught in possession in the early stages, leading to Newcastle's opener . David Silva was forced off with an injury just nine minutes into the first half . David Silva (off 9) Injury woe and now a doubt for the derby. Stevan Jovetic 5 . Precious little impact in the final third. Edin Dzeko 5.5 . See Jovetic. Edin Dzeko failed to make an impact as City struggled against Newcastle . Substitutes . Samir Nasri (on 9 & off 70) 5.5 . Floated around the periphery of the game without making any difference. Jesus Navas (on 59) 5.5 . Like all of his team-mates, failed to make a telling impact. Sergio Aguero (on 70) 6 . Too late for him to save the day this time. Sergio Aguero didn't have enough time to save City after coming on in the 70th minute . NEWCASTLE UNITED: (4-1-4-1) Rob Elliot 6.5 . Relatively untroubled but did what he had to with minimum fuss. Daryl Janmaat (off 63) 7 . Continues to look a class act – just why didn’t want of the bigger boys take a chance on him at £5m? Fabricio Coloccini 7.5 . Another assured performance from the skipper – he is the picture of cool and organised a young backline. Fabricio Coloccini (left) looked assured at the back and stayed strong throughout . Paul Dummett 7 . Switched to centre back from the left and did not look out of place. Massadio Haidara 7 . Offered as much in attack as he did in defence and might just have done enough to keep his place for Liverpool. Ryan Taylor 8 . What a reintroduction after 26 months out – first he crocks Silva and then sets up the opener. An admirable display. MOM. Mehdi Abeid 7 . Was strong in the tackle and crisp with his passing, a solid performance. Gabriel Obertan fires a shot towards goal during the Capital One Cup clash at the Etihad Stadium . Jack Colback 6.5 . Knitted play together in the middle of the park without being spectacular. Gabriel Obertan 7 . A willing runner, as ever, and caused problems for Kolarov down the right. Adam Armstrong 6.5 . It wasn’t the easiest of tasks as a lone frontman, but the teenager stuck to it and didn’t afford his minders a moment’s rest. Rolando Aarons (off 46) 7.5 . Terrorised City with his skill and pace and took his goal with the confidence of a seasoned striker, not an 18-year-old rookie. Aaron terrorised City's defence and scored the opening goal before coming off at half-time . Substitutes . Sammy Ameobi (on 46) 6.5 . Followed up his game-changing performance at Spurs with another tricky 45 minutes. Moussa Sissoko (on 63) 7.5 . Was brought on to help see home a 1-0 but made it safe with his quite brilliant second. Emmanuele Riviere (on 63) 6 . Took up the baton from Armstrong.","Ryan Taylor impresses during comeback from injury .

"Former Real Madrid manager Jorge Valdano believes his compatriot Lionel Messi looks tired and is no longer capable of causing havoc among opposition defences. Messi endured a difficult evening at the Bernabeu on Saturday as Barcelona lost the first Clasico of the season to bitter rivals Real. The 27-year-old had a game to forget, missing a clear-cut opportunity to score in the first-half as Carlo Ancelotti's men ran out 3-1 winners. Lionel Messi (centre) attempts to get away from Real Madrid midfielder Isco (left) at the Bernabeu . Former Real Madrid manager Jorge Valdano believes Messi has lost his ability to disrupt defences . Messi looks dejected during Barcelona's 3-1 La Liga defeat to fierce rivals Real Madrid on Saturday . Appearances: 9 . Goals scored: 7 . Assists: 7 . Chances created: 31 . Shooting accuracy: 64 per cent . Passing accuracy: 85 per cent . And Valdano, who also played for Los Blancos, is convinced that Messi's problems run deeper than just one poor performance. Speaking to Spanish newspaper Marca, the former Argentina international said: 'Looking at the last game, Messi is a little off-form. 'His position has changed on the pitch and now his job is more to provide assists, but he has lost his ability to disrupt the defence – something which used to solve many past games for Barca.' Messi was awarded the Golden Ball at the World Cup last summer after helping Argentina reach the final against Germany, but Valdano believes he was at far from his best in South America. He added: 'In the Brazil World Cup we saw that something was up with Messi; he walked around the pitch. 'He was physically not at his best and maybe that is the reason for playing further back, to not tire himself so much.'

"Head coach Stuart Lancaster insists there will be no radical alterations to England's approach in the autumn Tests despite the presence of innovative attack coach Brian Ashton at the squad's preparation camp this week. Ashton, the former Bath, England and Ireland head coach, was invited to England's base in Surrey on Monday and Tuesday so Lancaster and his coaching team can benefit from his experience. 'I don't want to create something that's not there,' Lancaster said. England head coach Stuart Lancaster instructs as his players are put through their paces at Pennyhill Park . Former England head coach Brian Ashton (middle) was at Pennyhill Park . England pair Billy Twelvetrees and Owen Farrell pass the ball during Tuesday's training session . 'It's for me to sit down and chat. Different ideas, different perspective. 'He's developed a lot of players, but actually he's developed a lot of coaches. He's somebody I've always stayed in contact with. 'He's a very creative attacking coach (but) we're not going to change anything we're not already doing. 'I think the way in which we try and play the game will remain the same.' The 68-year-old Ashton, now coaching Lancaster-based Vale of Lune in the North One West division, coached England to the 2007 World Cup final and Lancaster knows his side need to develop if they are to beat reigning world champions New Zealand in the opening international of the season on November 8. 'In terms of our attacking mindset, I think we've always had a strong one,' Lancaster said. 'We need to beat New Zealand by scoring tries as well as kicking points.' The All Blacks are the first opponents of an autumn schedule which sees South Africa (November 15), Samoa (November 22) and Australia (November 29) - opponents in Pool A at the 2015 World Cup - visit Twickenham. Luther Burrell is the biggest fitness concern due to a hand injury the Northampton centre suffered playing against the Ospreys. Lancaster conceded Burrell, who met a specialist on Tuesday following a scan, is unlikely to face the All Blacks. Luther Burrell is set to miss England's clash with New Zeland after sustaining a hand injury for Northampton . The centre is still to join up with England's squad and will see a specialist on Tuesday to discuss a scan . Lancaster, who revealed the prognosis was more encouraging than first feared and that surgery would not be required, said: 'He's not been in camp this week at all. He's still in the equation further down the line. He's definitely not out the series. 'Potentially he could come back into camp next week, but he won't have done any of the work. It would be a big step to put him in (against New Zealand).' England's other wounded players - Harlequins prop Joe Marler (quad), Saracens number eight Billy Vunipola (concussion), Kyle Eastmond (ribs), Harlequins wing Marland Yarde (ankle), Wasps back row James Haskell (virus) and Bath prop David Wilson (calf) - are expected to play a full part in training from next Monday at the latest. Lancaster is pleased with the opportunity to work with his players for a lengthy duration. 'It means that if players are required to come in, they are up to speed straight away,' he added. The All Blacks and other touring opposition have been entwined in international camps for some time, but Lancaster insists his squad's knowledge-base has developed from every spell as a group since his appointment in early 2012. 'The All Blacks, the South Africans, since the Super Rugby final, have been in camp - that's a 2.5 months camp,' Lancaster said. 'Their cohesion and understanding of their structures would be enhanced. 'But you could argue it the other way: they are at the end of a long, hard season and we are fresh at the start of ours. 'We have been together now for 2.5 years; every time we return, we are at the point we left because the players remember and we don't have to go back to square one. Samesa Rokoduguni passes the ball during the England training session . England trained in Surrey where the team's brand new gym complex and Dasso pitch are located . 'We are another level up to this time last year. Mainly because the players are similar - consistency in selection. 'Whilst the starting XV changes, generally the group is the same faces.' Lancaster knows this autumn is about a fine balance - giving his fringe players the Test experience they need while developing a winning mentality and a momentum which he wishes to take into World Cup year. 'You don't want to compromise your team because ultimately it comes down to winning,' Lancaster added. The pivotal fly-half position provokes a challenge as Saracens' Farrell has just returned from a thigh problem and Bath's George Ford is keen to get a chance to claim the number 10 jersey. Farrell has 26 caps and Ford two, while Stephen Myler has one, and Lancaster could provide a chance for the less experienced pair. 'George has now established himself there (in the Premiership), so the next step is to get him those international caps,' Lancaster said. Sam Burgess is soon to be a team-mate of Ford's at The Rec having made a high-profile transfer from rugby league. Lancaster is not about to meddle in his imminent arrival to union, adding: 'I'm sure he'll have one eye on our games, but I think he'll need to get bedded in at Bath.'

"Mario Balotelli will prove he is one of the best striker's in the world after ending his goal drought on Tuesday night, according to Liverpool team-mate Kolo Toure. The Italian striker has come in for criticism having failed to impress since arriving at Anfield from AC Milan in the summer but managed to find the net against Swansea to help the Reds progress to the Capital One Cup quarter finals. Toure believes Balotelli's first goal in nine matches will give the frontman a boost and told the Liverpool Echo: 'Mario needs to feed himself by scoring goals.

"Rob Howley fully expects Wales to face Australia's tried and tested quality when the 2015 Rugby World Cup pool rivals clash in Cardiff next week. It has been far from plain sailing for the Wallabies during their European tour preparations, a five-game schedule that starts against the Barbarians at Twickenham on Saturday. Kurtley Beale was dropped for the last two Rugby Championship Tests against Argentina and New Zealand after becoming embroiled in a high-profile row with Wallabies business manager Di Patston, who has since resigned. Rob Howley says Wales will still be up against a quality side, despite Australia's well-publicised problems . Kurtley Beale was sent home from the squad during the Rugby Championship after a row with Di Patston . Former coach Ewen McKenzie resigned immediately after the narrow defeat to New Zealand this month . The 25-year-old was fined £24,640 last week after being found guilty of a serious breach of the Australian Rugby Union's code of conduct. Coach Ewen McKenzie, meanwhile, announced his resignation immediately following Australia's dramatic 29-28 loss to New Zealand 10 days ago, and he was subsequently replaced by former Leinster and Stade Francais supremo Michael Cheika, who will also continue to head up a successful New South Wales Waratahs outfit until next year. Wales have lost nine successive games against the Wallabies since beating them 21-18 in November 2008 - five of those defeats were by four points or less - and Howley has dismissed any notion of life becoming any easier. Australia came very close to beating the All Blacks twice this season, and will still be a threat for Wales . Howley says off the field may not reflect what goes on the field and Australia will 'want to put a marker down' 'In Michael Cheika they have a coach who has won in the northern and southern hemisphere,' Wales assistant coach Howley said. 'He understands a lot of the players they have got and I have no doubt they will be in a good place. 'Sometimes, off the field doesn't reflect what goes on the field and they will come over knowing we are in the same World Cup group in less than a year's time. They will want to put a marker down. 'Australian players have got a knack of being clinical. They have great skill-sets and they will be no different this autumn. 'They play fantastic rugby and they probably should have beaten New Zealand in that last Test. They came up short in the last 90 seconds.' The Wallabies are in the same group as Wales for next year's Rugby World Cup . New Zealand beat their rivals in a close match last week, but Howley says the Wallabies 'should have won' Wales are themselves no strangers to suffering agonising late defeats against major opposition, which was most recently illustrated by a 31-30 loss against South Africa in Nelspruit when a late penalty try did for them. Since Warren Gatland took over as Wales head coach for the 2008 RBS 6 Nations campaign, games against South Africa, Australia and New Zealand number 25. The record shows one win and 24 defeats. Wales have consistently failed to get across the finishing line - that losing sequence reveals results like 17-16, 20-19, 14-12, 25-23 and 34-31 - but Howley believes the latest Springboks Test should lift Gatland's players. 'To be 17-0 up against South Africa and 13 points up with eight minutes to go, the players can take great confidence from that,' he added. 'That game was one we didn't deserve to lose because we played that well. 'They are the ones that hurt you more, particularly when it's the opportunity of beating South Africa (in South Africa) for the first time. 'The players can take great confidence from that because we had one of the top three teams in the world on the rack. Unfortunately, because of our composure, we didn't quite get across that line.' Wales have won just once against the leading Southern Hemisphere nations since Warren Gatland took over . Toby Faletau was part of the team that has come so close, but fallen short, repeatedly against top sides . Wales number eight Toby Faletau, an integral part of Gatland's plans during the 2015 World Cup build-up, has started 11 Tests in that losing run. 'It is going to be a tough autumn campaign,' Newport Gwent Dragons forward Faletau said. 'We are playing the best three sides in the world as well as Fiji, who are not run-overs. We will take each game as it comes. 'I guess to be so close and not quite get there, it has happened a few times for this squad. 'We will learn from these experiences and hopefully when it comes around again, we will be able to win these games.'","Wales face Wallabies in Cardiff next week in first November Test .

"England were last night grappling with familiar back-line dilemmas after admitting that Luther Burrell is destined to miss the start of their autumn campaign. Northampton centre Burrell is being assessed by his club after injuring a hand in the victory over the Ospreys on Saturday. There are also injuries up front but more uncertainty in the backs, with Kyle Eastmond (ribs) and Marland Yarde (ankle) unable to train so far, and Owen Farrell short of game time.

He’s definitely not out of the series (but) I think it would be tight for New Zealand (Sat November 8).’ Lancaster has plenty to ponder at 10, 12 and 13. Eastmond and Brad Barritt appeared to be emerging as the preferred midfield partnership in the absence of Manu Tuilagi, but Billy Twelvetrees, Jonathan Joseph and Henry Slade are also in the mix, along with the possibility of lining up two fly-halves, George Ford and Farrell, side by side. Meanwhile, England have had input from a former coach, Brian Ashton, the attacking guru who led the national team to the World Cup Final in 2007. ‘He’s someone who had a big influence on me as a coach,’ said Lancaster. ‘After the New Zealand tour we had a chat about the games and I invited him in to get his thoughts on what we’re doing. It’s not something that will be a regular occurrence. It’s good just to bounce ideas off him.’ England pair Billy Twelvetrees and Owen Farrell pass the ball during Tuesday's training session .

"James Haskell is confident he will be back to his fighting weight and in a fit state to face the All Blacks next week, despite a meningitis scare which led to a very anxious week in hospital. The Wasps captain was blazing a trail towards November’s QBE Test series at Twickenham as one of the form back-rowers in the country when he was abruptly struck down by a mystery virus earlier this month. What began as a cue for mocking jokes about man-flu and mad cow disease ended with a trip in an ambulance, medical confusion and extreme weight loss. James Haskell of England is tackled by Liam Messam of New Zealand at Eden Park in June . Haskell has teamed up with England at their Pennyhill Park camp after being bed-bound through illness . Haskell was on his way home from a trip to Manchester on October 16 when he began to feel unwell. The condition rapidly deteriorated and, by October 20, he was being tested in hospital amid fears he had contracted meningitis, which can be life threatening. That was eventually ruled out, but the savage virus he was struck down with proved hard to shake off. Having checked in for England duty last Sunday, Haskell relived the alarming episode yesterday, saying: ‘I’ve never been that ill in my life. It was weird, it just came upon me. ‘The Wasps doctor visited me at home and said, “There’s something wrong with you”. I said, “We all know that, but there’s something more wrong than normal!”. ‘They sent me to hospital. I went to Princess Margaret and they assessed me there, then they put me in Charing Cross on Fulham Palace Road. A week later, I came out on Friday. They thought I had meningitis and that was the big concern. That’s why they put me in an ambulance. They were saying, “You can’t mess around with that”. ‘They knew it wasn’t bacterial meningitis but they thought it might be the viral version because I had all the symptoms. So they got me straight on to the anti-virals and antibiotics. ‘The thing was, I got better a little bit so they stopped some of the stuff, then next day I hit rock bottom again. They weren’t sure what was going on so they did a lumbar puncture and took fluid out of my spine, and numerous blood tests.’ Haskell is an energetic character who did not enjoy being consigned to a hospital bed for the best part of a week. His usual routine of regular meals and punishing gym sessions were put on hold and it was an uncomfortable scenario for him. Haskell sits out of training on Tuesday as he continues to recover from his health scare . England head coach Stuart Lancaster instructs as his players are put through their paces at Pennyhill Park . ‘I’m not used to being inactive for that long,’ he said. ‘The big thing for me was not eating. I lost a lot of weight — about five kilos in a week. ‘I normally eat five or six times a day but I was struggling to get one or two meals in. The hospital food was good, but the lady was telling me off if I hadn’t eaten. ‘I couldn’t open my eyes because they were too sensitive to light. My lower back and neck were very stiff so I couldn’t really move out of bed. I spent hours lying in bed with a cold flannel on my head, in a dark room, on a drip, not eating or drinking — man down, really. My temperature was up to 38 degrees.’ By his own reckoning, Tuesday was the first day that Haskell felt more or less back to normal. The illness appeared to check his powerful charge towards an England starting place next month, but he remains convinced that he is well placed to feature against New Zealand. ‘I knew this (England) was coming up, I had been playing well and I wanted to keep that momentum going,’ he said. ‘The good thing was that I didn’t try to force my way back too soon. You’re only as good as your last game so I’m pretty positive because we got a good win against Bath — it was a few weeks ago now! ‘I trained with the forwards today, I did some stuff yesterday and I’m building back up every day. ‘I would be extremely disappointed if my illness had a factor in whether I am involved or not. ‘We have had two days of the camp. I have missed one session outside. I think that as of Thursday I will be back into the full mix of it, so I don’t think that is going to be an issue.’ England trained in Surrey where the team's brand new gym complex and Dasso pitch are located .

"Sam Allardyce has revealed he told his side to target Eliaquim Mangala as the weak link in Manchester City’s defence and blamed Manuel Pellegrini for leaving him exposed. In West Ham’s shock victory against City, the £32million summer signing from Porto had a torrid afternoon and could not cope with the powerful forward line of Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia. But West Ham manager Allardyce criticised City and Pellegrini for the way they have heaped pressure on Mangala as he learns to adapt to life in the Barclays Premier League. Sam Allardyce says West Ham identified Eliaquim Mangala as City's weak link . Allardyce said: ‘I think they leave him exposed. He’s only just joined. They don’t protect him and he’s only just got here. Vincent Kompany is used to it, he’s been at this level for such a long time. This lad’s not, he’s finding his feet and we made big strides down the left and caused them lots of problems.’ In only the ninth minute, Mangala  sent a clearance looping over Joe Hart which was dropping in until the keeper leapt back to push it over. Mangala looks dejected after the final whistle as City lost to West Ham . Twice he was beaten to headers by Sakho from long balls played in from free kicks. From one of them, Valencia raced on to the ball and was only denied by Hart rushing from goal. On two occasions he allowed Sakho to steal the ball, putting his side under pressure. Pellegrini offered no defence of his player in the wake of the defeat, but pointed to the defending of the whole team. Carlton Cole beats Mangala to the ball as the Hammers took all three points . But Allardyce was insistent that Mangala should have been looked after better. He added: ‘Maybe there should have been a bit more protection from other players. That wasn’t there and we exposed that.’ City have conceded 17 goals in all competitions this season after 14 games — two more than at the same stage last season. They have also kept only one clean sheet in the league. Their title rivals Chelsea, meanwhile, have five.","Eliaquim Mangala struggled to cope with Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia .

"Sam Allardyce is achieving something at West Ham this season which eluded Andre Villas-Boas at Tottenham and, more recently, Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool. How does a manager integrate so many new recruits - many from abroad, who do not speak the language well and have to adapt to the culture - into a side and get results immediately? West Ham’s win against Manchester City on Saturday turned their surprise start to the season into a run with a bit more substance. Diafra Sakho was on the scoresheet for West Ham as they beat Manchester United . Take a look at the side which lined up at Upton Park in the league against City this time last year — which was demolished 3-1 - and Allardyce has gutted the squad. There were eight changes to the starting XI on Saturday and five of those were summer signings. It cost Villas-Boas his job at Spurs when he failed to get the most out of £100million worth of new players and Rodgers is now experiencing a similar difficulty at Anfield. Sam Allardyce has done a good job working in the new players at West Ham into the existing squad . But a key advantage Allardyce has over those men is his experience as a manager — 20 years, 13 of those in the Barclays Premier League. Sakho is the second player in Premier League history to score in his first six starts in the competition, after Mick Quinn. ‘Learning from the early days of the Premier League with Bolton, an influx of eight, nine, 10, 11 players, 75 to 80 per cent foreign, taught me one lesson particularly: don’t just think about the player, think about family,’ Allardyce explained. ‘How you integrate them into the culture. Provide all the needs for them to settle as quick as possible. ‘The player settles quicker, they come into the club environment and are accepted by the captain. But the outside, when they go home, is very important; girlfriend, wife, family, make sure they settle into the right area. Adrian  celebrates at the final whistle with Alex Song after West Ham beat Manchester City 2-1 . ‘It’s hard to do, particularly if they don’t speak English well. I get a feel about a player when I speak to them. There are players I’ve spoken to and decided not to sign because of that last interview. Better doing it then than getting them here and having problems.’ Two summer signings, Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia, are forging one of the most frightening strike partnerships in the league. With a greater focus on attacking football this campaign, facing West Ham is a different prospect to last season. This is reflected in the difference between Sam Allardyce’s starting XI from last season’s home defeat to Manchester City and Saturday’s win in the corresponding fixture - only three players started both games. Only three players played for West Ham against Manchester City last season (left) and on Saturday (right) Sakho headed the winner against City, to score in his seventh consecutive game. Valencia, meanwhile, set up the first with a lightning run down the right to roll the ball to fellow recruit Morgan Amalfitano to tap in. The show was run by Alex Song, on loan from Barcelona. Full back Aaron Cresswell, the fifth new player starting, crossed deep from the left for Sakho’s winner. Allardyce added: ‘We give them the tools, then it’s down to them. If they are determined and have that much desire they take it up from there. Ours have this year.’ To help integration, the players take breakfast together every day at their Chadwell Heath training ground. Club captain Kevin Nolan and Mark Noble take the lead on helping the players adapt and a French-speaking physiotherapist helps with communication. Morgan Amalfitano opened the scoring for West Ham as they moved to within a point of Manchester City . It is not one way, either. Amalfitano sat an English exam while flying to an away game recently. ‘It’s good they have come here and are making a real effort to speak our language,’ Noble said. ‘Whether it’s giving encouragement in training, or asking if they need anything, it’s about keeping them happy.’ Right now, everyone is happy at West Ham - even Jose Mourinho is learning to love them. ‘Jose has just text to say “Well done big man”,’ said Allardyce. ‘This shows how important it was for him, never mind us. The result wasn’t for him. It was for us and everyone at West Ham.’","Sam Allardyce is drawing on his experience at Bolton to get his foreign stars settled at West Ham .

"Mark Bright claims many modern footballers have developed a 'soft underbelly' which influences their decisions when the going gets tough. Bright was writing in the Crystal Palace programme at the end of a week when debate has swirled around Liverpool teenager Raheem Sterling since he told England manager Roy Hodgson he was feeling tired. 'I was no Raheem Sterling, let’s get that clear, but at 19 years of age I was working 40 hours a week in an engineering factory in Stoke-on-Trent. I used to get up a 5am every morning, catch a bus to work and clock on at 6am,' said the former Leicester, Crystal Palace and Sheffield Wednesday striker. Mark Bright in action for Crystal Palace in 1992. He has claimed modern players have a soft underbelly . 'At 3pm I would clock off, catch another bus to Vale Park where Port Vale’s first-team coach John Rudge would be waiting for me at 3.30pm to take me into the gym to work on my heading, control, fitness and other aspects of my game. Around 5pm I’d shower and walk home to get some dinner then collapse into my bed. 'I did this roughly three times a week along with a Wednesday reserve team game for one season. I was tired and exhausted most of the time, sometimes too tired to go out socially with my friends at weekends, but I did it because I wanted to be a professional footballer.' Bright, who was at Selhurst Park for the game against Chelsea, added: 'When I turned pro at 20, I can categorically tell you that during my worst moments in football like getting booed and racially abused by my own fans at Leicester City, or going 17 games without a goal at Palace, I never asked to be left out of the team. Raheem Sterling complained of feeling tired while on international duty with England last week . 'On those days, social media wasn't born, no slogans were written on the walls of the training grounds and senior players kept the younger players in check. Someone would utter that old phrase: 'When the going gets tough, the tough get going' and no player wanted to show signs of weakness. 'Things have changed a bit since those days but there is a soft underbelly to a lot of the guys playing the game nowadays. 'Too much reward too soon isn’t something that can be reversed in football nowadays but at times it might be an easy way out when the going gets tough. 'I'm not suggesting that Sterling is doing this but I've heard players spend countless hours playing FIFA 15 on Xbox or PS4, sometimes well into the early hours of the morning. 'What players must do is make sure they are preparing themselves in the correct manner, in which they can maximise their full potential.' Sterling was left out of the starting line up against Estonia after a chat with manager Roy Hodgson .","Mark Bright believes players have a soft underbelly .

"Andy Carroll believes West Ham’s move to the Olympic Stadium could herald Champions League football. The target man has missed the entirety of the campaign so far thanks to a knee injury picked up in pre-season, but is looking at the Hammers’ prospects long-term. The east Londoners will move into the 54,000-seat Stratford ground in 2016, and Carroll thinks it could be the dawning of a new era for the club. Andy Carroll believes West Ham's move to the Olympic Stadium could lead to Champions League football . ‘When I first signed for the club the manager said this team could get into the top six and into Europe, and I can see the plan coming together now — it is not out of the question,’ Carroll told the Evening Standard. ‘With the players we have I can’t see any reason why we can’t do that. ‘We could definitely play in the Champions League in the new stadium. The quality is there, and with the new stadium coming we have everything else going for us.’ The Hammers will move to the London 2012 venue in 2016 after 100 years at The Boleyn Ground . Carroll’s ambition for the club deals a blow to Newcastle United’s hopes of resigning their former youth player in January. The striker’s agent Mark Curtis was asked about any return to St. James’ Park for Carroll and told the Newcastle Chronicle: ‘Not a chance.’ Instead Carroll is said to be focussed on returning for West Ham and winning back his place in the England side.

"West Ham will sport a newly-designed crest when they move to the Olympic Stadium from the start of the 2016-17 season.

"It was only on Friday that Sam Allardyce was mentioning Alex Song in the same breath as Yaya Toure. 'We've got a top quality player of the highest calibre and he's going to provide the sort of service our front line needs,' the West Ham manager gushed after happily making the Toure comparison. Like pretty much everything else he's done so far this season, Allardyce was right on the money. Barely 24 hours later, Song turned in a Toure-esque performance against Toure as West Ham preserved their place in the Champions League places with a 2-1 win over Manchester City. VIDEO Scroll down to watchSam Allardyce says he's delighted with win v Manchester City . Alex Song produced an excellent performance as West Ham beat Manchester City 2-1 on Saturday . The Cameroon international produced a performance that was reminiscent of Yaya Toure (right) at his best . Song even pulled out the 'Rabona' to put in a cross during the second half as West Ham ran out winners . Song was simply immense, patrolling the midfield, fetching and carrying, disrupting City's creative play and acting as the battering ram for West Ham's forward play. There were moments of brilliance, too. It was Song who delivered the pass that unlocked the City defence and set Enner Valencia free in the build-up to their first goal, converted at close range by Morgan Amalfitano. And he even pulled out the most popular trick of the week - the 'Rabona' - to deliver a cross during the second-half. By contrast, Toure, as so often this season, simply wasn't up for the battle. When Cameroon international Song, 27, was made available by Barcelona in the summer, Allardyce saw off competition from the likes of Napoli and Galatasaray to sign a player who had not been able to hold down a first-team place at the Nou Camp. Sam Allardyce's team are on the top and currently occupy one of the Champions League places . Song breaks up a Man City attack by lying on the ball as David Silva tries to retrieve it . Song's heap map from the City match shows just how much ground he covered in midfield . But when Song said shortly after his arrival that West Ham could 'maybe catch the European positions,' most mocked his ambition, especially following their troubles last season. He had just joined a new club and wanted to say the right things, they claimed. That aim is looking a whole lot more likely now as, following five wins from nine matches, the resurgent Hammers are fourth in the Premier League, a single point behind defending champions City. West Ham are a team transformed, the negative and conservative approach of the last few years replaced by something a little closer to their attacking tradition. If Song has as much influence in and around the training ground as he does on matchday, then he has proved a shrewd acquisition. Allardyce said as much on Friday: 'On the training ground he is a massive influence and in the changing room it's his dress sense that's the massive influence.

Jokes about his fashion tastes aside, what a presence to have in the squad. A man who competed at the highest level for Arsenal and Barcelona, a La Liga champion and a man with 47 caps for his country. Song can only bring benefit. There are plenty of other clubs in the Premier League - Arsenal included - who would have valued a Song-like figure this season. The Gunners are crying out for a defensive shield, while even Liverpool and Manchester United would have benefitted from such a grafter to protect the back line. Just look at his statistics from Saturday at Upton Park - he recovered possession on 11 occasions, stifling a potentially dangerous City move on each occasion. Diafra Sakho continued his hot scoring streak with the goal that proved to be the winner at Upton Park . His heat map shows Song covered the full sweep of the midfield and he covered 10.7km during the course of his 90 minutes. Song's efforts proved key and he was rightly selected as the man of the match. While the likes of Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho, again on target on Saturday, may steal the headlines, Song's influence at revitalised West Ham must not be overlooked.","Alex Song was excellent as West Ham beat Manchester City 2-1 on Saturday .

"West Ham's Olympic Stadium conversion could include the seating in both main stands rearranged to include two large crossed hammers. The plan is likely to see most of the black seats currently fixed in the stadium changed to white, with the exception of several hundred black seats that are likely to be rearranged to create the two club crests ahead of the Hammers moving into their new home in 2016. Details of the plan emerged at a stakeholder’s meeting at the club, where the ongoing stadium transformation work was discussed.

"A ONE-OFF TRIUMPH . Swansea may be the former holders of the Capital One Cup but this competition in all its guises has actually been pretty unkind to the Welsh club over the years. Only once in their entire history have Swansea actually got beyond the fourth round and that was last year. Liverpool, meanwhile, had scored in all but two of their last 50 League Cup ties. Despite Marvin Emmes (centre) opener, Swansea still have only reached the League Cup fifth round once . TIME TO PROVE THEIR WORTH . Brendan Rodgers’ ability to nurture and develop young talent is not in doubt as the progress witnessed from players like Raheem Sterling, Jordan Henderson and Daniel Sturridge illustrates. However, his judgement in the transfer market remains open to question. Forget the likes of Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert for a moment and consider that Lazar Markovic and Fabio Borini - both starters on Tuesday night - cost just over £30m between them. Lazar Markovic (left) and Fabio Borini have both failed to live up to expectation at Anfield so far in their careers . GOOD TO BE HOME? The last time Jonjo Shelvey played here for Swansea last season he scored a remarkable goal from about 30 yards. The former Liverpool midfielder did his best not to celebrate but he could have been forgiven a look towards the Main Stand in the direction of a bloke in front of the press box who spent the two years previous likening him to ‘Bambi on Ice..without any skates on’. Jonjo Shelvey (centre) provided an industrious display in midfield for Swansea against Liverpool on Tuesday . A FUSS ABOUT NOTHING . There was excitement in the world of social media last night when reports emerged of another Mario Balotelli bust-up. However suggestions that the errant Liverpool striker had been ordered off the pitch for not warming up properly proved to be errant. Balotelli actually had a twinge in his knee.

"Former Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler is adamant Brendan Rodgers will guide his side into Champions League qualification this season despite a slow start to the campaign. The reds narrowly missed out on the title last season, having briefly sat top of the table before a late slip-up handed Manchester City the crown.

'There is only Manchester City - maybe after a little bit of a blip at the weekend - and Chelsea who are on fire so it's not all bad. 'I think we are not a million miles away and I'm very confident in the squad that Brendan has put together and his ethos, and his mentality. 'I think he will get it right. I don't think he will - I know he will - he's such a good manager.' Perhaps Fowler has reason to be so forthright as Liverpool staged a dramatic comeback to beat Swansea in the Capital One Cup at Anfield on Tuesday evening.

"Sitting on the substitutes bench, his night already over, Rickie Lambert must have watched Liverpool’s late comeback and struggled to be phlegmatic. For 70 minutes the Liverpool centre forward - still awaiting his first goal for the club - had struggled in a team seemingly incapable of playing to his strengths. As a rather lame home defeat beckoned, though, things changed. Rickie Lambert (right) started Liverpool's 2-1 Capital One Cup victory against Swansea on Tuesday night . The Liverpool striker (centre) has failed to score for his new club since his £4million move from Southampton . First Fabio Borini crossed in front of the Kop for Mario Balotelli to score from six yards and then a free-kick struck deep to the far post in injury time was headed in by central defender Dejan Lovren. Undoubtedly, Lambert would have fancied his chances with both. As he lies awake at night, that is what the 32-year-old must wish for. A cross right on to his instep, a mistake from a goalkeeper. Something he can’t miss. Something to get him going. Deep in his footballer’s soul, though, Lambert will know that his troubles at Anfield are not down to misfortune. Footballers always know and as such Lambert will appreciate that his Liverpool career - such as it is - is stalling because of his own failings. Liverpool have a problem with goals in the post-Luis Suarez era, that much is clear. This time last season they had scored 28 times. Already they are nine behind the rate. Lambert (right) was given a rare oppotunity to impress boss Brendan Rodgers but failed to do so on Tuesday . Lambert, though, looks like a centre forward simply waiting for things to happen. If he carries on in this vein, they simply will not. On Tuesday night he was largely static, inert. He was tidy at times but he never bullied the Swansea central defenders, never ran the channels, never stretched anyone. As a consequence, he had one shot, straight at the goalkeeper from 18 yards a minute before he was replaced by Balotelli with 11 left. Keep in mind just how ordinary Liverpool’s centre forwards have been this season and the Lambert issue becomes clear. Balotelli had scored once before Tuesday night. Daniel Sturridge has not played since September because of injury. Yet Lambert has been used so sparingly it is almost embarrassing. Lambert (right) was replaced by Mario Balotelli in the 79th minute at Anfield on Tuesday night . In the Barclays Premier League, he has started one game and lasted an hour. In six other league games he has been given a total of exactly 90 minutes as a substitute. For England, he has been used as a replacement three times, two of those appearances beginning in the 89th minute. The sympathetic may suggest Lambert merely hasn’t been given an opportunity. How can you score goals if you don't play? Centre forwards depend on rhythm after all. However, the more cynical may say that Lambert has shown nothing in training sessions to suggest he is ready for a place. To take that theory to its logical end is to wonder if Rodgers is beginning to wonder if the £4million he gave to Southampton in the summer was a waste of money. Other - more expensive - signings have struggled too this season. Balotelli (centre) equalised for Liverpool as they went on to beat Swansea 2-1 in their Capital One Cup tie . Lazar Markovic - who cost £20m - was wretched against Swansea while Emre Can - £10m – has played only twice. However, Lambert’s story is more poignant because of its symbolism, the beetroot boy given a chance at his boyhood club. One feels that a goal may spur him but it looks some way distant at the moment and perhaps he should take something from the approach of Jonjo Shelvey. A player sold by Liverpool because he wasn’t good enough, the midfielder always returns to Anfield as though determined to prove the club were wrong. Last season he scored here for Swansea from 30 yards and again he was excellent on Tuesday night. Shelvey arrives at Anfield to enjoy himself. Lambert looks frankly cowed.

"Jose Mourinho claims Chelsea are ‘in trouble’ as they battle with fatigue ahead of Tuesday evening’s trip to face Shrewsbury in the Capital One Cup. The Chelsea boss is furious that his team have been forced to return from Sunday’s 1-1 draw with Manchester United to play again just 48 hours later. Mourinho’s weary players flew back to London Gatwick at 8pm on Sunday after the Old Trafford clash and were back in for a recovery session at their Cobham base on Monday. Chelsea captain John Terry posted this picture on his Instagram as the squad travelled to face Shrewsbury . Terry grapples with Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo during their clash at Old Trafford on Sunday . After training, they made the 170-mile journey by bus to Shrewsbury to prepare for Tuesday's Capital One Cup tie against Micky Mellon’s League Two team. Mourinho, irritated by the TV scheduling, said: ‘We are in trouble because we have so many injured players and that makes it even more difficult for us. ‘We have only one day to prepare. We now have a difficult match because they are doing very well in their league and doing very well against superior teams in the Capital One Cup. It’s a big day for them. We know it will be difficult for us. But that’s football. ‘Shrewsbury in the Capital One Cup is not a friendly. We have to play matches with respect and the best way to respect Shrewsbury is to go there with a good team; not to go there with a weak team and lose. ‘If they win, they win, but they win against a good team. We are in a difficult situation but when you look at the players who didn’t play, (Andre) Schurrle, (Mohamed) Salah, (Kurt) Zouma, (Nathan) Ake, (John Obi) Mikel, these boys are obviously going to have to play.’ Brazil midfielder Oscar posted on his Twitter page this snap with Filipe Luis and Willian on Monday night . Mourinho’s injury list includes Spain striker Diego Costa — expected to return for Saturday’s clash with QPR at Stamford Bridge in the Barclays Premier League — and fellow forward Loic Remy. Although Didier Drogba, who scored Chelsea’s goal against United, is an option, Mourinho is tempted to play Schurrle in the main striking role. The German World Cup winner’s chances in the first team have been limited this season, but Mourinho will use him this evening. Costa has been given extra time to rest after Mourinho admitted he wasn’t fit to travel to United because of his persistent groin problem. Mourinho added: ‘The virus is fine. Didier Drogba celebrates his goal at Old Trafford on Sunday with Chelsea team-mates Gary Cahill and Willian . ‘It was hard when he went to hospital and it obviously doesn’t him help to recover from the injury. But he didn’t go to United because of the injury, not because of the virus. ‘He aggravated the hamstrings because he played two matches in three days (with Spain) and was not with us.’ Mourinho will give opportunities to younger players at Greenhous Meadow and is considering giving 19-year-old Lewis Baker some first-team experience in the fourth-round tie. The Chelsea manager added: ‘Baker has a long way to go but he has the potential. ‘That’s why he is a Chelsea player. We are sure that he will be a good player.’ Cahill looks on in despair as Chelsea concede a Robin van Persie goal in stoppage time to surrender the win .","Chelsea face Shrewsbury in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday .

As well as the return of Ronaldo to Old Trafford, Manchester United duo Angel di Maria and Marcos Rojo will also play for Argentina at their club ground.

"Fresh from rescuing a last-minute  draw against Chelsea in so-called 'Fergie Time', Manchester United players arrived punctually for the launch of a collection of watches inspired by the 1999 Treble-winning season. Manager Louis van Gaal will accept no excuses for lateness after official timepiece partner Bulova released three watches - available in silver, blue and a red version, that will be worn by players and staff. United legend Andy Cole, who was part of the historic Treble-winning team, was present for the launch - while the first team squad, including Robin van Persie, Angel di Maria and Luke Shaw but not Phil Jones, posed in their club suits under grey skies at Old Trafford.

Former Red Devils manager Sir Alex Ferguson inspired the term 'Fergie Time' Van Persie throws his shirt into the stands after scoring an injury time equaliser against Chelsea . United are renowned for their exhaustive list of global partnerships, which have helped fund the club's unprecedented spending spree in the summer that saw the likes of Di Maria, Shaw and Radamel Falcao arrive . According to the club’s official website, United currently has 29 sponsors and commercial partners - including everything from diesel engine parts to potato chips. They have a world record shirt sponsorship deal with Chevrolet, worth £47million-a-year for seven years - while they also receive £17m-a-year to have their training kits sponsored by Aon. Van Persie has also been used to promote a brand of tomato juice across Asia . Former United players Javier Hernandez, Rio Ferdinand and Ryan Giggs pose with Mister Potato crisps . In the latest full-year accounts released for the club, covering the 2012-13 season, United’s commercial operation pulled in £152.5m. However that figure has grown dramatically, with estimates suggesting that figure will be closer to £190m when the next full-year results - which cover 2013-14 - are released later this month. Accounts covering the current season are expected to show commercial income closer to £240m when they are released next year. As a result, the Old Trafford commercial operation will also allow the club continue to sign elite players and pay massive wages, comparable with captain Wayne Rooney who earns £300,000 a week.

"Luke Shaw thinks it would be foolish to write Manchester United's title chances off just yet. With nine games gone, United are eighth in the Barclays Premier League, some 10 points off the summit. Shaw has been encouraged by the team's performance in the 1-1 draw against leaders Chelsea though, and he believes he and his team-mates are still playing below their potential. Luke Shaw claimed that Manchester United are still a daunting proposition for other teams . Shaw has struggled to break into the team this season but did start against Chelsea at Old Trafford . The former Southampton player thinks when United hit top gear they will strike fear into the hearts of their opponents and that is why he refuses to give up hope of topping the table come May. 'Of course we are still in the title race,' the United defender said. 'It's a long season and we are at the start of it. You don't know what will happen during the middle of the season. 'It will take time but when we are all on form I think we are going to be a scary team to face.' Although Chelsea top the table, arguably the biggest test for Shaw and his United team-mates will come on Sunday when they travel to the Etihad Stadium to take on bitter rivals Manchester City. The England defender said the Manchester derby was one of the biggest games in the world . The former Southampton man posted a photo of himself after playing crazy golf with friends . If - as is expected - Radamel Falcao recovers from a leg injury he sustained in training, and Ander Herrera returns to the starting XI, United will have six players in their team who have never experienced a Manchester derby before. Each and every one of them will be acutely aware of what the fixture means to the fans, Shaw says. 'It's pretty obvious what this match means to the fans and the club. I don't think I need to be told about it and the other (new signings) will be aware too,' the Surrey-born teenager said. 'I've watched it for the past years and I've seen how much it means to everyone. 'It's one of the biggest occasions in football after the World Cups and Champions League finals. 'It's a massive occasion for everyone involved in it. We need to come out firing on Sunday.' Shaw picks out United's 2-1 victory over City in 2011 as his favourite Manchester derby. Wayne Rooney is expected to return for the Manchester derby after serving a three-game suspension . Colombian forward Radamel Falcao could also return against City after injuring himself in training . That day Wayne Rooney scored the most memorable goal of his career - an acrobatic overhead kick which sealed victory for United with 12 minutes left. Rooney has sat out the last three games due to suspension so Shaw thinks the striker will be itching to put on another match-winning display when he returns this weekend. 'It's a massive boost for us to have him back,' Shaw said. 'It's something I think he's looking forward to. Wayne hates sitting on the sidelines watching. 'That goal (in 2011) was an unbelievable goal in a match that big. It was something special.' Shaw revealed his father Paul was in the stands at Old Trafford on Sunday to watch the 1-1 stalemate with Chelsea. Shaw senior used to take his son to Stamford Bridge to watch the Blues, but the Londoner is now very much a red, according to the England full-back. 'My dad is a United fan now. He's not Chelsea any more,' Shaw said with a smile. 'He is a United fan now and he won't be too happy (with Sunday's result) because he wanted us to win really badly.'","Man Utd face rivals City next in the Premier League .

"Barcelona striker Luis Suarez has opened up about his time at Liverpool and what he really thought about former manager Brendan Rodgers. Writing in his upcoming autobiography, Crossing The Line: My Story, Suarez lifts the lid on Rodgers' tiki-taka philosophy and reveals what the Liverpool squad really thought about their manager's envelope stunt. In extracts published by The Guardian, the Uruguay forward speaks in detail about a controversial moment broadcast in Channel 5 documentary, 'Being: Liverpool'. Luis Suarez (left) had a good relationship with Brendan Rodgers (right) while the pair were at Liverpool . Rodgers was shown during a documentary using a strange method to motivate his Liverpool players . Rodgers was seen presenting his players with three sealed envelopes, in which he claimed were the names of the players who would disappoint him during the upcoming season. The squad, the manager explained, were to make sure it wasn't them come the end of the campaign. 'If I was excited (about Rodgers' reign), others were worried,' Suarez explains. 'And no, not because of the famous envelopes that appeared during a TV documentary about the club. Mostly, we just joked about that particular episode, but the manager’s methods really worked for us. 'We never did find out what was written in those envelopes. I’m sure there were no names, it was just a way of motivating us; a tactic to make sure we gave everything. And in truth it got forgotten pretty quickly.' Suarez also writes about the first time he met Rodgers after the Northern Irishman's appointment at Liverpool. Making a special effort with his star man, the Reds boss spoke Spanish. Rodgers made a special effort to speak Spanish to Suarez the first time the pair met . Rodgers addresses his squad on the Channel 5 documentary Being: Liverpool . Suarez (centre) made his debut for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the weekend . 'The first chat I had with him was at Melwood [Liverpool’s training ground], just after he was confirmed as Liverpool’s new manager. It wasn’t a long conversation, just the typical welcome to the club stuff, but he also wanted to talk to me because there had been suggestions there was a chance of me going to Juventus. 'Brendan spoke to me in Spanish and he told me to give him time, to give him a chance, and that I would like the way we were going to play. It would suit me. He said we would bring the ball out on the floor, keep possession and play attacking football. I remember him saying, “It’s not so hard to bring the ball out from the back on the floor, you know”.' It is clear that the pair had a strong relationship before Suarez's £75million move to Barcelona in July. The 27-year-old continues to explain how Rodgers immediately got him on side with his philosophy. 'From the start, it convinced me. It made sense. And although the results weren’t good, I could see that we were playing better. I was excited. Brendan’s philosophy was to play on the floor, keep possession of the ball and, if we lost it, to pressure to get it back. Don’t panic, don’t play so fast as we had the previous season, look for the spaces at the right time. 'But you could see a Spanish influence in the way that Brendan worked. He was interested in Spain, he had studied there, and what he’d learned there was at the heart of our style of play: passing, pressuring high, quick movement, arriving into the area rather than standing there waiting for it, coming inside from wide positions.'","Luis Suarez is releasing an autobiography: 'Crossing The Line: My Story'

"Louis van Gaal made James Wilson change his shirt number because the Manchester United manager believes a striker should have a nine on his back. Wilson sported the No 49 shirt when he came on as a second-half substitute for Juan Mata during United's 1-1 draw against Chelsea at Old Trafford on Sunday.

Wilson rose through the ranks at United and Sunday was the teenager's third appearance in the Premier League, having scored twice against Hull last season. In October against Everton, Wilson became the 30th player used by Van Gaal this season - more than any other team as the Dutchman feels his way around his new squad. The No 47 slot remains vacant at Old Trafford. Previous owners of the No 49 shirt are Ravel Morrison and Frederic Veseli, but neither played in the Premier League for the Red Devils.

"He was only officially told that he was playing two hours before kickoff but in reality there was no doubt. The man who humiliated England on one leg four weeks after a knee operation was hardly going to wait another second once his four-month ban was over. Luis Suarez was back in a competitive game on Saturday for the first time since sinking his teeth into Giorgio Chiellini. And while Real Madrid were being vociferously serenaded in the Bernabeu after a masterful performance, it was easy to forget Suarez might have won Barcelona the game early on. Former Liverpool striker Suarez is tackled by Isco as Toni Kroos (centre) and Sergio Ramos (right) look on . Here was the Suarez we know, charging around, unable to concede any cause, however lost. And here was the quality at which we came to wonder in the precise, raking cross that found Neymar on three minutes to open the scoring. He did it again on 23 minutes, another delightful ball from the right into the path of Lionel Messi. On this occasion Iker Casillas made a fantastic save. And on that moment the game turned. ‘We could have scored the second,’ said Suarez. ‘After that, they hurt us with their tactics and killed us on the counter. We have a one-point advantage in the league so we have to be positive.’ Suarez was a constant thorn in the side of the Real Madrid defence and caused havoc on his Barcelona debut . Afterwards his manager Luis Enrique deemed that he had done ‘pretty well — better than expected.’ He lasted 68 minutes and in that first half especially was a major contributor. The ‘bittersweet’ feeling Suarez spoke of after was the fact that his return was tempered by such a dominant Real Madrid victory. By the end the Bernabeu was united in a chorus of Viva Espana — a poke in the eye of growing Catalan nationalism — and roaring those ‘Oles’ as their team passed the ball around. As Pepe, scorer of the second goal, said: ‘It’s a long time since we heard “Oles” at the Bernabeu against Barcelona.’ Suarez celebrates after assisting Neymar just three minutes into his Barcelona debut since his summer move . France international Karim Benzema finished a superb move to give Real Madrid a two goal advantage . Real looked formidable, much more than a team of Galacticos, but a balanced unit. The fear for Suarez is that he has joined Barcelona just as the balance of power is tilting Real’s way. In most areas, Real Madrid were superior. You will struggle to find defenders as strong as Pepe and Sergio Ramos or midfielders with the poise of Toni Kroos and Luka Modric. The greatest compliment you can pay Kroos and Modric is that they made Xavi and Andres Iniesta look old. Cristiano Ronaldo surpassed Messi in the battle of the superstars but he was just one of many, with Isco and Karim Benzema also excellent. ‘I have a very professional team who understand what it means sacrifice themselves for the team,’ said manager Carlo Ancelotti. ‘To win against Barcelona in the manner we did is really important.’ Sky Sports shows La Liga as part of an unrivalled autumn of sport that includes coverage of the Premier League, F1, ATP tennis, autumn international rugby and UEFA Champions League.

"Rangers football board chairman Sandy Easdale has confirmed Derek Llambias has been hired as a consultant by the Ibrox club. The former Newcastle United managing director jetted into Glasgow on Monday night before holding talks with the Light Blues board on Tuesday morning. Llambias is a close ally of Mike Ashley and had been expected to replace Graham Wallace - who resigned on Monday - as chief executive. New Rangers consultant Derek Llambias makes his way into Ibrox stadium on Tuesday . Billionaire Sports Direct tycoon Ashley - who owns around nine per cent of Rangers, runs their retail division and holds naming rights to the Ibrox stadium - has put himself in an even better position to control the crisis-hit club after they accepted his £2million loan offer. The terms give him security over the Albion Car Park and Edmiston House facility next to Ibrox - and crucially the right to pick two new board members. But Easdale told Sky Sports News that Llambias is being brought in as a consultant, rather than as a new board member. He said: 'I've not had any discussions with him. As far as I am aware he is a consultant at the moment.' Meanwhile, the Union of Fans supporters' coalition group has slammed chairman David Somers and directors James Easdale - brother of Sandy - and Norman Crighton for backing Ashley's rescue bid. The cameras are on Llambias as he arrives at Ibrox to take up his new role as consultant . Dave King had promised the cash-strapped Glasgow giants a £16million investment package but in return demanded control of the club. That bid was rebuffed last week, as was an 11th-hour loan from Sale Sharks owner Brian Kennedy which was worth £3million. The fans' statement read: 'The Rangers support and the club itself has once again been betrayed by those tasked with overseeing the health and success of our great football club. 'The decision by the non-executive directors of the Plc board, Mr Somers, Mr James Easdale and Mr Norman Crighton, to effectively hand control of the club to Mike Ashley in return for a £2m, short term loan, is an absolute disgrace. 'They have acted in a cowardly way and have been bullied by Mike Ashley and Sandy Easdale into giving them precisely what they want with no regard for the club. Rangers board chairman Sandy Easdale is mobbed by the press as he leaves Ibrox on Tuesday . 'The club was at a crossroads. The board had to decide whether to take us down the route of a long term, £16m, sustainable investment and the start of a process where fans could once again trust those tasked with nursing Rangers back to health. 'Instead they have handed Mike Ashley control of the boardroom for a pittance which will now have to be repaid out of the pockets of the dwindling number of Rangers fans who still choose to support this regime financially. 'They have neglected their duty to shareholders, fans and the club itself. Their cowardly act now means we are likely to see Mr Ashley gain long term control of the club's remaining commercial income without having to actually invest a penny. 'The board has, through a policy of inaction and cooperation with Sandy Easdale's shareholder group, allowed a situation to develop where corporate vultures are grabbing what assets they can. 'There is no long term plan. There is no investment. We simply limp from one short term fix to another, each time giving away more of the family silver, despite a clear alternative being available. Llambias (right) with Newcastle manager Alan Pardew during a club announcement in October 2012 . 'Sandy Easdale's pronouncement that the Plc board 'did their duty and their due diligence accordingly' and have done 'what's in the best interests of the fans, the club and the shareholders' is the type of laughable nonsense we have come to expect from him. 'Mr Easdale certainly got what he wanted which was the retention of his seat in the director's box and his club tie. The club and the fans have been sold down the river and this is another kick in the teeth for both them and the reputable shareholders still involved at Rangers. 'Mr Easdale, rather than disingenuous statements, should explain to fans why he actively blocked a £16m investment that could have taken the club forward. 'It is now a matter of individual conscience for fans if they wish to continue to fund the corporate pillaging of our football club. They should be under no illusions however that every time they purchase a single item in either Sports Direct or our club shops, they are paying for the privilege of allowing Mike Ashley to strengthen his grip on our commercial operations in a move which could hamstring the club for a generation. 'Also for the remainder of this season, every match ticket they buy will be used to pay Mr Ashley back the money he has lent for control of our club. Effectively they will be paying him for the privilege of his power grab.'

"It’s business as usual in the world of Massimo Cellino. As we embark on another month, Leeds United will have themselves a new manager. Neil Redfearn has all but agreed to become the next in an ever-expanding line of head coaches at Elland Road. Odds are he won’t last. Not because the 49-year-old doesn’t have the skillset to reinvigorate Leeds, far from it. The length of his tenure will be decided by an Italian hell-bent on transforming the fortunes of this massive club at breakneck speed and with regard to who he tramples in the process. Neil Redfearn is expected to take permanent charge of Leeds United in the coming days . Redfearn will want assurances that he can resume his job in the academy if the role does not work out . Leeds owner Massimo Cellino appointed Darko Milanic last month, but sacked him after just 32 days . Fans in Yorkshire aren’t surprised, and they’re quite right not to be. Cellino is an individual who rules with little reason. When the switch flicks, there is no stopping him. Unfortunately for Leeds they are the latest club to have flickered and sputtered under his ownership. To summarise what’s happened since he took over – and not touching on the canteen staff at Thorp Arch getting the boot – Dave Hockaday was afforded 70 days in charge before Darko Milanic lasted just six games. The only period of solidity this season has come under Redfearn on the back of Hockaday’s sacking when the caretaker took 10 points from a possible 12. He wanted the top job but was overlooked. Milanic may or may not have worked out – we will now never know. There were suggestions from fans that he set out not to lose games rather than attempting to win them and it could’ve been that he was a doomed appointment from the get-go. Cellino’s failing here was not to perform due diligence. ‘I made a mistake with this guy. He’s negative, he has a losing mentality,’ he told the Yorkshire Evening Post after sacking the Slovenian. Slovenian Milanic was appointed on a two-year deal but did not even last two months at Elland . Cellino has the Yorkshire club's best interests at heart but makes knee-jerk decisions all too often . It beggars belief that an owner of a football club – charged with making decisive action after getting it so wrong with Hockaday – was not already aware of the sort of football Milanic would be bringing with him. Cellino has his club’s best interests at heart - that hasn’t been questioned by supporters - in a similar vein to the much-maligned Venky’s at Blackburn Rovers. That much is clear; so too is the illogical decision-making. The 58-year-old’s chief difficultly is an inability to think before reaching the sort of verdicts which could plunge Leeds into really serious trouble. What if Redfearn - a man Cellino clearly didn't fancy to begin with - doesn't carry on where he left off? There could be another p45 on its way. Leeds' loss to Wolves at the weekend was the final straw for Cellino, who sacked Milanic afterwards . Cellino reacts while watching the game alongside Redfearn, who he will appoint permanently . Former Cagliari boss Nedo Sonetti is alleged to have been sacked by Cellino for eating a four-kilo sea bass . Sonetti is said to have been spotted by Cellino eating the fish in a clubhouse at Cagliari's training base . After all, this is the same man who is alleged to have sacked a boss at Cagliari for eating sea bass. In a quote dug up by Rory Smith in the Times on Tuesday, Nedo Sonetti said years after his dismissal in 2002: ‘He always says he has just cause [for sacking a manager]. In my case he said that he had seen me in a clubhouse at the training ground eating a four-kilo sea bass. That was his cause. There is simply no talking to a man who relieves someone of their livelihood on the back of eating an obscene amount of fish. Leeds must hope that his impulses are lucky guesses from now on.","Neil Redfearn is poised to become Leeds' manager on a permanent basis .

"Borussia Monchengladbach held Bayern Munich to an exciting 0-0 draw on Sunday as the Bundesliga's top two teams maintained their unbeaten starts to the season, with Bayern unable to carry their blistering Champions League form into the domestic game this week. Bayern, looking to extend their lead at the top of the table, had goalkeeper Manuel Neuer to thank for keeping the game scoreless and their closest rivals four points at bay after nine games. Pep Guardiola's side had dominated the first half with David Alaba going closest but Gladbach, who confirmed their credentials as the Bavarians' nearest rival in the Bundesliga this season, responded well in the second half and arguably had the better chances to win it.

"It was the most predictable and the most unpredictable of starts for Luis Suarez. He caused havoc in his first 45 mintues, creating a goal for Neymar and what should have been a goal for Messi but was the only one of Barcelona’s front there not to pick up an early booking. Back from his four month ban for biting Georgio Chiellini the Uruguayan striker kept himself out of trouble in the first half but was a constant thorn in Pepe and Sergio Ramos’ side. It was his pass that set up Neymar for the first goal. Having started on the right he played in the Brazilian who still had plenty to do and did it well to give Barcelona the lead. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Former Liverpool striker Suarez is tackled by Isco as Toni Kroos (centre) and Sergio Ramos (right) look on . Suarez was a constant thorn in the side of the Real Madrid defence and caused havoc on his Barcelona debut . Suarez celebrates after assisting Neymar just three minutes into his Barcelona debut since his summer move . He held the ball up well with his back to goal and aside from one loose pass to Xavi his distribution was good. But Barça have bought him for his ability to unsettle opposition defenders and that is what he did throughout his first 45 minutes back in action. Concerns had been aired pre-match that he would not be fit enough to play the biggest fixture in European football but at times in the first half it had appeared it was Pepe and Sergio Ramos who looked as if they had spent the last four months kicking their heels and not Suarez. He should have had assist number two when he set up Messi with an even better cross from the right but the Argentine forward inexplicable failed to accept the gift. The game turned on that miss. Suarez loses the ball to Real Madrid defender Ramos as Barcelona lost 3-1 to their fierce La Liga rivals . Suarez creates a diversion as Barcelona's Neymar moves forward with the ball as Carvajal watches on . Suarez appears to gesture to the referee as Ramos and Dani Carvajal keep a close eye on the frontman . He went into one crunching challenge with Isco that left him hobbling for the next five minutes feeling his right knee but came out for the second half going down under another challenge this time from Luka Modric that earned Barça a free-kick on the edge of the area. Suarez is a fair way down the pecking order and Xavi wasted the kick much to the former Liverpool striker’s frustration. Suarez was still full of running in the second half and released Neymar as Barcelona tried to hit back straight away. With a lung busting run he made it into the area for the return pass but the referee penalised him for a foul on Ramos as he lost and regained the ball from the Spain defender. It was one of those fouls that probably would not have been given in the Premier League and the reaction summed up that frustration throwing his arms up at referee Jesus Gil Manzano. If Luis Enrique had decided to take Suarez off on the hour he changed his mind with his first 15 minutes of the second half. He should have been awarded a foul after Ramos pulled him back between the half way line and the penalty area. He grew increasingly frustrated as Madrid’s third goal went in. There were others who looked to have tired more in the second half but his number nine finally came up on 70 minutes. There had been no dream comeback but Barça fans disappointed at the heavy defeat can take much encouragement from the debut.","Luis Suarez loses 3-1 to Real Madrid on Barcelona debut .

"On the pitch, Arsene Wenger watches Alexis Sanchez take his Arsenal tally to eight with a clinical double to sink sorry Sunderland. Behind him sits Theo Walcott, the fit-again England star who he cannot wait to unleash alongside Sanchez — possibly as soon as Saturday when Burnley visit the Emirates. ‘My imagination works like yours,’ said Wenger when pressed on the prospect of Walcott joining forces with the Chilean forward. Alexis Sanchez wheels away after scoring his second in Arsenal's 2-0 win at Sunderland . A terrible back pass by Wes Brown allowed Sanchez to steal the ball and open the scoring . Sanchez nips in to seal his brace after an even worse defensive error from Sunderland keeper Vito Mannone . Sanchez's heat map shows how he dominated the centre of Arsenal's attack against the Black Cats . Arsene Wenger was not impressed with the decision to show a yellow card to Danny Welbeck for diving. The Arsenal and England forward was cautioned when Kevin Friend ruled that he toppled too easily under a challenge from John O’Shea. Replays, however, support Wenger’s claim that the booking was unjust. Earlier, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was also judged to have dived – although he wasn’t booked – when Wes Brown’s clumsy tackle sent him crashing to the ground. And, when asked if his players had been the victim of the recent debate on diving, Wenger said ‘You should ask the referee (that), but I didn’t see a dive (with Welbeck), it was very harsh. And I think in the first half when Chamberlain went through there was a foul as well.’ ‘Theo’s runs off the ball are fantastic and he gives you hope that we will score.’ In the meantime, Sanchez has kept Arsenal, in fifth, clinging to the early-season pace-setters. The £30million signing from Barcelona punished a calamitous Sunderland. First he seized upon Wes Brown’s horribly undercooked back-pass before drawing goalkeeper Vito Mannone to him with the ease of a snake charmer and dinking delightfully beyond him. Then, when Mannone panicked under pressure from Sanchez late on, the Arsenal man stole in to win the ball and prod it home. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has certainly been impressed by his new comrade, likening him to Luis Suarez, the player who, ironically, replaced Sanchez at the Nou Camp. ‘He’s a world-class player — everyone saw that at the World Cup,’ said the 21-year-old. ‘He reminds me of Luis Suarez when he chases everything down and he makes nothing into something. He’s done that for us twice and he’s scored goals at important times for us.’ Theo Walcott (L)  chats with Aaron Ramsey after returning from a long spell out with a knee ligament injury . Deleilah the Sunderland mascot welcomes Walcott back at the Stadium of Light . Arsene Wenger (L) is looking forward to playing Walcott and Sanchez together for the first time . Sunderland have only won one of their last 22 league games against Arsenal. Arsenal’s victory was just their third in the league this season but arrived on the back of their come-from-behind triumph at Anderlecht. Injuries have blighted their progress — Mesut Ozil, Mathieu Debuchy and Olivier Giroud are long-term absentees — but Mathieu Flamini insists their season remains very much intact. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has likened Sanchez to former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez . Mathieu Flamini insists that Arsenal are on the road to recovery after a struggling start . ‘It has been tough for us,’ he said. ‘But if you look where we are, in the top six and hopefully on course for the next stage of the Champions League, then it has not been a bad start this season. ‘The spirit in the team this year is great.’ Sanchez, it seems, has made all the difference. Gus Poyet says it is ‘impossible’ for Sunderland to win matches if they continue to gift goals to the opposition. The Black Cats were guilty of a string of defensive howlers as they were beaten 8-0 at Southampton last weekend. But mistakes from Wes Brown and goalkeeper Vito Mannone allowed Alexis Sanchez to score twice on Saturday, and Poyet warned: ‘We cannot make any more. No more mistakes. Individual like that, no more, otherwise it is impossible to win games.’","Arsenal beat Sunderland 2-0 in their Premier League clash on Saturday .

"The moment was laced with symbolism. Just as Brendan Rodgers was walking into Anfield’s press room, news began to filter through that Luis Suarez was up and running in Spain. Before Rodgers had settled into his chair and explained 90 minutes of frustration, clips were already circulating on the internet of the goal Suarez had created three minutes into his Barcelona debut with an inch-perfect cross-field pass for Neymar. How Liverpool could have done with such ingenuity as they huffed and puffed against Hull. It wasn’t that they were particularly bad in this 0-0 draw, it was just they missed a spark to ignite everything, to turn the weight of possession into the goals. Daniel Sturridge watched on in the stands as Liverpool struggled against Hull at Anfield . This is only the second time in 13 games against Hull that Liverpool have failed to score. Liverpool have scored 13 Premier League goals this season. They had 17 by the same stage last term. Nobody expected Liverpool to match the 100-plus strikes of last season once Suarez had departed for Catalonia, but they have gone from being a team that you expected to score heavily every time they set foot on a pitch to one that has lost a killer instinct. Own goal 3 . Raheem Sterling 3 . Steven Gerrard 2 . Philippe Coutinho 1 . Jordan Henderson 1 . Daniel Sturridge 1 . Alberto Moreno 1 . Adam Lallana 1 . ‘I think we had that confidence last season,’ Rodgers said. ‘When we go into games we still have it. That confidence doesn’t diminish. What was important here was if we didn’t score then we didn’t concede. Defensively we looked solid. It was just unfortunate that we didn’t get three points.’ Unfortunate or careless? Though Eldin Jakupovic, Hull’s third-choice goalkeeper, earned himself a generous ovation from The Kop at the final whistle after making a string of late saves, the best of which came from Philippe Coutinho, he should have been taken out of the equation. Mario Balotelli, inevitably, had the game’s defining moment in injury time but, after a magical piece of play from Coutinho, the Italian got his feet caught in the wrong position and kicked at fresh air just as the stadium was ready to shout ‘goal’. Luis Suarez had an impressive debut for Barcelona setting up Neymar's opener against Real Madrid . Mario Balotelli had another frustrating afternoon for Liverpool missing a golden opportunity late on . LIVERPOOL (4-3-3): Mignolet 7; Manquillo 7, Skrtel 7, Lovren 6.5, Moreno 6.5; Can 6 (Henderson 75min, 6), Gerrard 7.5, Allen 6 (Coutinho 61, 7); Sterling 7, Balotelli 6.5, Lallana 6 (Lambert 61, 7.5). Subs not used: Jones, Johnson, Toure, Markovic. Booked: Henderson, Sterling, Balotelli. HULL (3-5-2): Jakupovic 8; Bruce 7.5, Chester 7, Davies 7; Elmohamady 6.5, Huddlestone 6, Livermore 6.5, Diame 7.5 (Meyler 86), Brady 7.5; Ben Arfa 7 (Aluko 71, 6), Hernandez 6 (Ramirez 71, 5.5). Subs not used: Watson, Rosenior, McShane, Quinn. Booked: Ben Arfa, Huddlestone. Referee: Neil Swarbrick 7. Man of the match: Eldin Jakupovic. ‘He will be disappointed because he had two big chances,’ Rodgers observed. ‘Then there was the one at the end but it wasn’t to be. It just didn’t fall for him.’ It is indicative of where they are at this moment. Their joint-top scorer — on three — in the Barclays Premier League with Raheem Sterling is ‘own goal’ and both of Liverpool’s next opponents Swansea (with Wilfried Bony) and Newcastle (Papiss Cisse) have forwards with better goal tallies. Perhaps an answer, albeit a temporary one until Daniel Sturridge is fit again, would be to deploy Balotelli, who it must be noted was better than he has been, alongside Rickie Lambert in a front two. ‘When Sturridge comes back you will see the confidence because of his movement and he is dynamic’, explained Rodgers. ‘But he isn’t fit and hasn’t been for a long time. So we have to work without him and while we are doing that, we are staying up and around the top end of the table.’ As Rodgers knows, however, to stay up there permanently, they need a cutting edge.","Luis Suarez took three minutes to get his first assist for Barcelona .

"The honours keep on coming for Laura Davies. Less than 48 hours after a visit to Buckingham Palace to be formally made a Dame, Britain’s greatest-ever female golfer learned on Wednesday she is to be inducted into the prestigious World Golf Hall of Fame. The ceremony will take place at St Andrews University in July next year in the same week as the Open Championship will be played over the Old Course. With 74 worldwide victories to her name including four majors, it’s another well-deserved honour for 50-year-old Davies, who heads up the Hall of Fame class of 2015, alongside Australian David Graham, former Open Champion Mark O’Meara and golf course designer AW Tillinghast. Laura Davies will be inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame at St Andrews next year . English star Davies has won four majors and 74 tournaments worldwide during a glittering career . ‘It’s a wonderful honour and I am especially looking forward to being inducted at St Andrews,’ said Davies. Putting the honour into context, the Hall of Fame selection commission only meets every other year and no more than five inductees are permitted at any one time. The Hall of Fame, based in St Augustine, Florida, recognises not just the leading players but others who have made a contribution to the game’s rich history like Tillinghast, who designed such world-renowned courses as Winged Foot, Bethpage Black and Baltusrol. Mark O'Meara receives his green jacket from Tiger Woods after winning the Masters at Augusta in 1998 . O’Meara won not only The Open in 1998 but the Masters as well, plus 20 other victories worldwide during his illustrious career.

"When the celebrations had finally subsided and Didier Drogba was dragged off his knees, he raised his hand in the direction of Jose Mourinho. Chelsea’s manager was there, standing on the edge of the technical area to acknowledge a job well done. That’s what tactics are for. For all the talk of formations - 4231, 442, 442, 352, whatever - nothing beats the big man bullying a little man at a set-piece. Didier Drogba celebrates after scoring the opening goal for Chelsea against Manchester United on Sunday . Drogba rises high above United defender Rafael to head the ball towards goal as Chelsea take the lead . Drogba, one of the best headers of the ball in the business, versus Rafael at a corner to be supplied by the king of the assists Cesc Fabregas? It really wasn’t a fair fight. They picked on Rafael, highlighting him at a corner and leaving Drogba to score one of the best headers of his glorious Chelsea career. The Ivory Coast forward can do no wrong again. Poor Rafael, he will be made the scapegoat because Chelsea’s manager pinpointed a weakness and highlighted it when Drogba was drafted into the team at short notice. The goal was a beauty, one of Drogba’s very best and played out on one of the biggest stages of all. Theatre of Dreams? Drogba is living the dream again. To think that, at the age of 36 he could start and finish a game of this magnitude. This is Manchester United, not Maribor. He bullied Louis van Gaal’s defence, rising to the occasion after Diego Costa and Loic Remy were deemed unit. Drogba was in his element here. Drogba (centre) wheels away to celebrate his opening goal as his Chelsea team-mates rush to join him . Drogba looks dejected at the final whistle after United's late equaliser as he walks off the pitch . ‘Rafael is one of the best defenders, but he lacks height,’ admitted van Gaal. ‘It was a communication problem. ‘I have said that many times because in England everyone is big and our players are much smaller than our opponents.’ What a performance by Drogba, even if the gloss was taken off it by Robin van Persie’s sensational injury time equaliser for United. To come to Old Trafford, just over two years since he announced his tearful farewell in the lobby of the Chelsea Health Club and Spa at Stamford Bridge, and play like this is extraordinary. ‘It is not fair on my other players, but he was fantastic,’ declared Mourinho. Drogba has only just returned to training and yet it has been another fulfilling week in this man’s remarkable football career. On Tuesday evening, when Chelsea played Maribor in a routine Champions League group game at the Bridge, there was next to no chance of him starting here.

That all changed when Remy, who injured his groin just before he scored against the Slovenians, was forced to come off midway through the first half. Enter Drogba, scoring from the penalty spot when he asked for Eden Hazard’s permission and adding another here at Old Trafford. He is a special player. ‘He has only trained for one week since his injury, so I am happy with everything he did,’ added Mourinho. ‘If I talked about only Drogba I would have to start from Courtois and go all the way through the team. I am so happy, that is the only thing I can say.’ Drogba’s goal took us back to a time when he was the main man in this Chelsea team, the beating heart when they won two Barclays Premier League titles under Mourinho. He stuck around for one more before he finally landed the big one - the Champions League - on that giddy night inside the Allianz Arena in May 2012. He has been globetrotting since, with spells at Shanghai Shenhua and Galatasary, but everybody knows that Chelsea really is his home.

On Sunday he stirred the memories again, reminding us of times when he won the FA Cup for Chelsea with that brilliant extra-time winner against United at the newly re-opened Wembley in 2007. When he scored the opening goal in front of the old Scoreboard End last night he immediately set off to celebrate in front of the travelling Chelsea supporters. To the he is a legend, a model professional. He conducts himself with class and dignity at all times, which is why he has stretched his career out until his 37th birthday in March. By then he will be close to celebrating another special title.","Didier Drogba scored the opening goal in Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Manchester United .

"Europe’s banker foursomes pairing of Ian Poulter and Justin Rose had already trampled on American opposition before the start of the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles on Friday morning. The English duo have designed their first course together at China’s Mission Hills Shenzhen-Dongguan, just across the border from Hong Kong, which has 12 courses. The new Rose-Poulter course, which opens next month, is set up for matchplay. It is a complete re-design of the previously named David Duval course, which has been consigned to the deep rough. Foursomes pait Ian Poulter and Justin Rose during Thursday's practice at Gleneagles . Mission Hills name the courses after their famous golfing designers, such as Jack Nicklaus, Greg Norman, Nick Faldo, Ernie Els and Jose Maria Olazabal. But it was felt that former world No 1 Duval, a Ryder Cup player in 1999 and 2001, had fallen too far off the golfing map. His design wasn’t considered a good one, either. Rose and Poulter will officially open their course on October 28 with a singles matchplay. The winner is to receive a luxury flat on the Missions Hills complex. Ian Poulter and Justin Rose were in good spirits ahead of the start of the Ryder Cup . All week in the captains’ press conferences, Europe’s Paul McGinley has come across as the more assured leader. But after the pairings were announced on Thursday, it was noticeable the USA’s Tom Watson suddenly looked the more confident. United States team captain Tom Watson speaks during the opening ceremony . The chances of traffic meltdown around Gleneagles this morning, with 45,000 spectators arriving in the dark to be there for that iconic first tee shot at 7.35am, are more likely than an Ian Poulter fist pump, such has been the shambolic transport planning. It reached the ludicrous situation on Thursday of the driver of a media bus adding to an already lengthy one-and-a-half hour journey from Glasgow by stopping in a Marks & Spencer car park for a 30-minute rest because he had exceeded his designated hours. Byrom, who run Ryder Cup travel services, pass the buck and said they were only one of a number of agencies involved in the transport blueprint and they had sub-contracted the botched bus service. Official Ryder Cup media transport  driver has to stop near Dunlane in a M&S car park for a half hour break . The merchandising tent at Gleneagles is doing better business than the one at Celtic Manor in 2010, although it is nowhere near as big as the Medinah operation, which made more than £10m in three days of frenzied trading. This follows retail specialists Kitbag taking over the running from marketing agents IMG after a tender. Kitbag’s online business has also seen 5,000 commemorative Ryder Cup £5 notes sold for £20 each. Stars sidelined at gig . The music at the Ryder Cup gala concert in Glasgow was considered top drawer but those who went to the event principally to see the golfers introduced to the crowd would have felt very short-changed. There was only 20 minutes allocated for the players in the Hydro Arena proceedings and they were rushed through the ceremony, with only brief words from the two captains. Dull Scottish radio presenter Fred MacAuley, who had great trouble recognising who was who, announced one competitor and partner just as another couple was walking on to the stage. Team Europe congratulate singer Amy Macdonald for her performance in the opening ceremony . This diluted the marvellous reception given to both sides, with not a moment allowed to soak up the special applause, especially loud for Tom Watson and local boy Stephen Gallacher. Even the European team, who had complained about the length of their stay at the concert in Chicago, felt they should have been on stage longer to make it more of an occasion. Phil Mickelson’s barb about Rory Mcllroy and Graeme McDowell ‘litigating’ against each other has not affected the harmony within Team Europe. But there has been some discord behind the scenes with Scotland’s Paul Lawrie, who played in 2012, very upset he wasn’t picked as a vice-captain when the event is being staged on his home soil. Paul McGinley preferred Spain’s Miguel Angel Jimenez and Jose Maria Olazabal.

"Real Madrid's attack is beginning to gel, prompting the Spanish press to label them as 'the best in the world'. Carlo Ancelotti's side beat Levante 5-0 on Saturday, with Cristiano Ronaldo continuing his superb early-season form. The World Player of the Year now has 15 goals in seven league games.

"Raphael Varane was thrilled with France's containment of Cristiano Ronaldo at the Stade de France on Saturday night. Varane, playing alongside Manchester City centre back Eliaquim Mangala, succeeded in keeping the Real Madrid star relatively quiet as France prevailed 2-1 over Portugal.

"Sam Allardyce was positively brimming with bouquets. He praised his resolute defenders, he celebrated his strikers, he paid particular tribute to the brilliance of Alex Song, West Ham’s most influential contributor. But, in the wake of a genuinely momentous victory, he could not refrain from stealing a modest moment at centre stage. The cue was a suggestion that he might feel vindicated by the recent performances of his team, following the critical bruisings he had suffered last season. He started to mutter about the dangers of looking back, of dwelling on the past. Then he burst out: ‘It’s well documented: I’m still here!’ In fairness, only the meanest curmudgeon would deny the manager his satisfaction. If West Ham had found an available replacement, then Allardyce would surely have been on his way last spring. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch...

Ratings by SAM CUNNINGHAM at Upton Park . This morning, as his team reflect on their third win in succession and look down on all but a handful of the Premier League, his job seems blissfully secure. Allardyce spoke of ‘a terrific performance’ and ‘a massive, massive victory’. Indeed it was. As a consequence of a full-hearted, soundly-organised effort, the title ambitions of Chelsea have moved into sharper focus. As a further consequence, the continued tenure of City’s Manuel Pellegrini is coming into question. The Chilean denied feeling under any pressure, but since he also asserted that his team had deserved to win this absorbing match, his judgment may not be entirely reliable. For City are currently playing like strangers to their real form. A side which once reeked of class, now reeks of something like passive complacency, a malady best demonstrated by the man who was once their most devastating player. Until the team finally found itself, deep in the second half, Yaya Toure had performed like a weary irrelevance. His impact was minimal, his contribution belying the talent which had once made him one of the English game’s most illustrious imports. Just as Song toiled and sweated for the midfield control he enjoyed, so Toure seemed reluctant to join the battle. With Sergio Aguero untypically missing chances galore, with Eliaquim Mangala suffering a merciless chasing from West Ham’s front men, and with Vincent Kompany not only equally ineffective but hugely fortunate to remain on the field after a string of frustrated lunges, the wonder was that City remained in the argument for so long. Goals from Morgan Amalfitano and Diafra Sakho had carried West Ham clear and, despite a fine retaliation from the admirable David Silva late on, City never did enough to state a plausible case. They were left to curse a number of squandered opportunities, but they had done little to deserve equality. Their rally had arrived too late and carried too little conviction. They began with a degree of optimism. Aguero, running from half way, battered a drive which caught a deflection and saw Adrian scrambling at the foot of a post. Then Silva struck a free kick a foot over from 22 yards. And that was about as good as it got for City in the first half. As Song assumed total midfield control and the front runners Morgan Amalfitano and Enner Valencia began to persecute City’s centre-backs, the champions were reduced to hopeful retaliation on the break. A West Ham success seemed inevitable, and it came in the 21st minute. Song slid a pass down the right, Valencia sprinted on, reached the byline and pulled back an inviting cross. The ball evaded Pablo Zabaleta, and Amalfitano was awarded the simplest tap-in. It was no more than West Ham’s control had deserved.

The notion that Allardyce’s side have suddenly become a team of tap dancers is fanciful. They are strong, muscular, relentlessly direct. But this should have come as no great surprise to City. They knew precisely what would confront them, and they failed to cope with the problems. For a side with title pretensions, it was woeful. West Ham were winning battles all over the pitch, and might have scored a second when Valencia dived at a half-chance as a low cross came skidding in from Aaron Cresswell. Kompany was booked on 44 minutes for cleaning out Valencia with a peevish assault. Then, from the rarest of breaks, City might have equalised on the stroke of half time, when Aguero almost squeezed in a chance at the near post. He failed, and it would have been a travesty had he succeeded. Pellegrini sat in the dug out, shaking his head. This was not how the plot was supposed to unfold. The City manager sent out the same side for the second half, presumably obeying the managerial dictum which says: ‘You lot got us into this. You can get us out.’ Yet his team’s plight might well have grown even worse when the thoroughly rattled Kompany went crashing into Valencia and escaped the card which would have seen him dismissed. Nevertheless, City started to enter the game. Toure began to appear vaguely interested, and the appearance of Stevan Jovetic for Edin Dzeko introduced an extra sense of purpose. After 59 minutes, they had their best chance yet but Aguero’s shot was saved by Adrian’s knees. A minute later, the Argentine struck the bar and the ball bounced down to Toure, who drove it into the goalkeeper’s midriff from four yards. By now, the fight was on, and City seemed more likely to prosper when an interchange between Silva and Aguero allowed Toure to bounce a drive against the angle of post and bar. But in the 75th minute, West Ham appeared to strike the decisive blow, when Cresswell, advancing down the left, flighted a cross and Sakho, leaping immoderately, scored the header, becoming just the second player to score in all of his first six Premier League starts. But, as Upton Park celebrated, City began to play their most impressive football of the match. At last, the fluid movement which had been absent returned with a rush, and their reward arrived within two minutes. Silva picked his way nimbly from the right, deceived Mark Noble, and swirled the most precise drive inside the far post. From there on, the match was up for grabs, with City making despairing efforts to take the consolation of a point. But West Ham survived the frenzied attacks, and at the final whistle, they collapsed in claret and blue heaps all over the field; exhausted, but justly triumphant.

Sampdoria players celebrate after keeping their unbeaten record in tact following the goalless draw . The visitors had the better of the match as Gervinho struck the post in the first half before Alessandro Florenzi's header was brilliantly saved by Romero in the second. Stefano Okako missed Sampdoria's best opening when he fired over from two metres as a free kick landed at his feet. 'It was a good game between two teams which play a lovely style of football,' Sampdoria coach Sinisa Mihajlovic said. 'My lads were very good, today we took step up in quality, showing that we can take on anyone, especially at home.' Roma veteran Francesco Totti weaves his magic in between Sampdoria defenders before being substituted .

Sampdoria did have the ball in the back of the net but Manolo Gabbiadini's strike was ruled out for offside. Roma youth product Stefano Okaka also missed a good opportunity for Samp as he blasted over from about three yards out. The draw took Roma level on points with leaders Juventus, who hold top spot on goal difference and host Palermo on Sunday, while Sampdoria have now won four and drawn four of their eight games this term. Antonio Cassano (R) scored for Parma but couldn't prevent them from losing 3-1 to local rivals Sassuolo . Meanwhile, Parma's season went from bad to worse as they were beaten 3-1 at home by local rivals Sassuolo, who celebrated their first victory of the campaign. Parma continue to prop up the rest of the division after suffering a seventh defeat in eight Serie A games this season, leaving them stuck on three points. Sergio Floccari, Francesco Acerbi and Saphir Taider did the damage at the Stadio Tardini as Sassuolo took maximum points for the first time this term to move out of the bottom three. Antonio Cassano pulled a goal back late on for Parma, but it was nothing more than a consolation on another forgettable evening for Roberto Donadoni's side. Danilo Avelar is hoisted in the air by teammates after his brace helped Cagliari to a 4-0 win over Empoli . In Saturday's other game, Cagliari leapfrogged Empoli in the standings thanks to an emphatic 4-0 win in Tuscany. Four goals in 15 minutes leading up to half-time did the damage for the visitors, with the hosts doing their best to recover in the second period but unable to prevent a third loss of the season. Marco Sau put Zdenek Zeman's men in front before two goals from Danilo Avelar, the second from the penalty spot, and an Albin Ekdal strike sealed the points for the Sardinians.","Roma missed the chance to top Serie A after 0-0 draw with Sampdoria .

"Former Chelsea and Arsenal left back Ashley Cole took some time off from playing for Roma to take on a different challenge as he faced up to the silky skills of  freestyler Sean Garnier. Garnier had to quit professional football in his native France due to injuries but has since become one of the most famous freestylers in the world and in 2008 he won the inaugural Red Bull Street Style World Finals. With his feet moving so quickly they were almost a blur, Cole had to keep his eyes firmly on the ball as Garnier strutted his stuff when the two met this weekend. Ashley Cole waits for his moment and then pounces to nick the ball from freestyler Sean Garnier . Cole (right) has enjoyed a solid start to life at Roma but played in the 7-1 defeat against Bayern Munich . The 33-year-old, who has 107 England caps, showed he's lost none of his defensive nous as he let his French opponent  perform his mesmerising tricks before nipping in to dispossess him when the opportunity arose. Shortly before making the tackle, Cole joked, 'I don't want to hurt you' while he watched Garnier flick the ball right and left. The ex-England international took the applause as he ended up with the ball, but he may be relieved at getting back to his day job and facing up to more conventional opponents when he next lines up for Roma.

"Alex McCarthy is hoping his second game in goal for Queens Park Rangers turns out to be less traumatic than his first. The 25-year-old, who chose Rangers over Liverpool when Reading accepted bids from both two months ago, is hoping to keep his place at home to Aston Villa tonight. His bow came last week and just happened to be against Liverpool, whose 3-2 victory saw two Rangers defenders — Richard Dunne and then, just seconds from the final whistle, Steven Caulker — put own goals past him. Alex McCarthy can only look on as Steven Caulker turns the ball into his own net to gift Liverpool the win . The 25-year-old keeper has had to wait for his chance at Loftus Road, but hopes to keep his place for Villa . ‘It’s a debut I won’t be able to forget,’ he said. ‘I’m hoping this game will be more straightforward, a nice 1-0 and a clean sheet will do.’ Those come rarely for struggling Rangers, whose manager Harry Redknapp spent most of last week engaged in a war of words with Adel Taarabt, the midfielder he had insisted was too fat to be picked. ‘The whole team have been focused and it hasn’t affected anyone at all,’ insisted McCarthy. McCarthy was unfortunate to concede three times on his debut, with Richard Dunne also scoring an own goal . The former Reading keeper made a few good saves but was unable to do anything about all three goals . That hasn’t stopped Taarabt from being the butt of some dressing-room banter. ‘We’ve had a few laughs here and there about it but Adel doesn’t take anything to heart,’ he said. McCarthy was part of the Reading team who were relegated two seasons ago and a return to the Championship with Rangers is already a distinct possibility. But the man who was an unused England squad member in 2013 decided to take that chance instead of rejoining Brendan Rodgers, briefly his manager at Reading. ‘A lot of people have asked how I could turn down a Champions League team,’ he said. ‘It was a tough decision, the toughest I’ve had to make in football but with myself still being young, the main thing was playing games.’ McCarthy claims the issues surrounding Adel Taarabt have not had any influence on the 'focused' squad .","Goalkeeper Alex McCarthy joined QPR from Reading this summer .

"Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League fixtures, as well as intriguing statistics from the Football League. 1) The dramatic Manchester United equaliser that followed the dismissal of Branislav Ivanovic was a reminder that the depth of Chelsea’s squad remains to be tested. He was one of seven players in the side that lined up at Old Trafford who have started every Premier League game this season, while Oscar has missed only one match. Cesar Azpilicueta was ever present before this game, while Diego Costa has missed just two. Branislav Ivanovic, one of seven Chelsea players to have started every game, was sent off against Man United . Manager Jose Mourinho has given starts to just 16 players in total, compared to the 23 used so far by biggest title rivals Manchester City. If Chelsea want to match the achievements of Arsenal’s 2003-4 Invincibles they can’t afford too many suspensions. The legendary Gunners side had nine players who appeared in more than 30 League games. 2) Southampton need to start talking to midfielder Jack Cork about a new contract or risk losing the midfielder for nothing when his current deal expires next summer. The 25-year-old has struggled to break into Ronald Koeman’s first team, but after playing his part in the 8-0 destruction of Sunderland was again excellent in the win over Stoke. In the 62 minutes before he was subbed after taking a knock he’d found a team mate with 38 of his 40 passes, and covered more ground (5.0 miles) than any other Saints player. Southampton midfielder Jack Cork, pictured in action against Stoke, has impressed in his last two outings . 3) Letting Jack Colback move up the road to Newcastle for nothing always seemed an odd bit of business by Sunderland, and the flame haired midfielder continues to be one of Alan Pardew’s key players. Any of the quarter-backs playing in Sunday’s NFL game at Wembley would have appreciated the pass he hit for Sammy Ameobi’s goal seven seconds after half time at Tottenham. And Colback, described earlier this season by Roy Hodgson as the ‘ginger Andrea Pirlo’, continued to be an unsung hero in the Toon’s 2-1 win, only once failing to find a team mate with a pass in the entire 90 minutes. Newcastle midfielder Jack Colback challenges Tottenham wideman Erik Lamela during the Magpies 2-1 win . 4) James Collins might not be the world’s greatest centre back with the ball at his feet, but when it comes to courage the Welsh international is never found wanting. The 31-year-old set the tone early in the game for West Ham’s committed defending against Manchester City by getting hit in a defensive wall without flinching. He went on to make three more equally brave blocks, won 100 per cent of his heading duels, and his 12 clearances were as many as the rest of Hammers’ defence put together. West Ham defender James Collins makes a courageous challenge to deny Man City frontman Sergio Aguero . 5) Saido Berahino is the young man you want when there’s a crucial penalty to be taken – as he proved by slotting away West Bromwich Albion’s injury time equaliser against Crystal Palace. The striker has never failed to score from 12 yards, and insisted on keeping spot kick duties despite the arrival in the summer of midfielder Craig Gardner – who took them successfully for both Sunderland and Birmingham. He’s justified that with three now among his eight goals this campaign – and also scored a crucial one that helped England’s Under 21 side qualify for next summer’s European Championship finals. West Brom striker Saido Berahino is yet to miss from the penalty spot and netted against Crystal Palace . 6) Winger Jefferson Montero has been Swansea’s super-sub all season, appearing in all but one of their Premier League matches but never getting more than 25 minutes. That finally changed when he got his first League start against Leicester, and the 25-year-old Ecuador international made the most of the chance. His pace – only Wayne Routledge recorded a quicker top speed than his 20.5mph - made him a constant threat, and he laid on the chance for Wilfried Bony’s second goal in the 2-0 win. Jefferson Montero has appeared in all but one of Swansea's games but has yet to play more than 25 minutes . 7) Brighton boss Sami Hyppia needs to get his strikers firing – of the four forwards on his books only Craig Mackail-Smith has hit the target in the Championship with the princely sum of one goal. When Joe Bennett gave the Seagulls the lead against Rotherham it was the eighth of the club’s last nine to be scored by a defender – making it all the more annoying when former Brighton frontman Alex Revell grabbed an equaliser. 8) Mick McCarthy has always prided himself on the resilience of his teams, but his Ipswich side have suddenly developed an inability to hang on to a lead. In the last four games they have let nine points slip away from winning positions, and the latest came when Nahki Wells struck twice to help Huddersfield recover from being 2-0 down at Portman Road. Brighton defender Joe Bennett (right) is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring against Rotherham . 9) Notts County’s rookie boss Shaun Derry raised eyebrows in the summer when he brought in five players aged over 30 as part of an overhaul of the club’s squad that saw 17 leave and 14 new arrivals. The former QPR midfielder’s trust in signing senior pros in an era when most clubs just want young prospects with a resale value is working pretty well. Their 1-0 success at Scunthorpe, achieved when on loan Wolves winger Zeli Ismail converted a last minute penalty, was his team’s sixth win in a row and took them into third place in League One. 10) Jamie Cureton has a career average of a goal every three games, which is not bad for a 39-year-old with 766 senior appearances behind him, stretching right back to when he made his debut for Norwich in November 1994. He remains as consistent as ever. His strike that earned Dagenham a 1-1 draw at Wycombe in League Two was his fifth in 15 League appearances this season. Dagenham and Redbridge striker Jamie Cureton, now 39, has a career average of a goal every three games .","Chelsea's squad yet to be tested - seven players have started every game .

"Harry Redknapp has branded Adel Taarabt a ‘blatant liar’. Redknapp claimed after his QPR side’s 3-2 home loss to Liverpool a week ago that his maverick Morocco midfielder was unpickable because he was ‘three stone overweight’. The player was quickly able to disprove the claim and sent some stinging criticism Redknapp’s way, insinuating that the manager rarely bothered attending training.

"QPR manager Harry Redknapp bears no grudge against Adel Taarabt following their public spat this week and insists he merely wants the Morocco playmaker to return to shape and form. Redknapp and Taarabt had a public argument after the Rangers boss accused the midfielder, who spent last season on loan at Fulham and AC Milan, of being overweight. 'I don't hold grudges,' Redknapp said. Adel Taarabt posted this on his Instagram, proving he works hard during training sessions at QPR . Taarabt spoke to the Daily Mail to hit back at his manager's claims, and prove that he is not overweight . 'He got pushed into writing a load of stuff that wasn't true. I don't think he's been fined and I wouldn't want to fine him. 'I've always been a manager where people go, 'You do love a problem player'. Yes, I have. 'The big difference is the ones I've had before keep producing on the pitch. 'Unfortunately at the moment Adel needs to produce. He's got great talent. 'He could be an incredible, incredible footballer for this football club.' Harry Redknapp originally claimed that Taarabt is overweight and unfit to play for QPR . Taarabt has played for five clubs in his professional career, including AC Milan (left) and QPR (right) Redknapp lost patience with Taarabt after last Sunday's last-gasp loss to Liverpool, which kept Rangers bottom of the Barclays Premier League ahead of Monday's clash with Aston Villa at Loftus Road. The QPR boss added: ""It was something that happened before the game and during the week. Maybe I just got the needle. When I get the hump I do tend to say what I feel. ""He has tested me. He's tested everybody. (But) I'm the one that's stuck with him. ""I'm bang on his side. No-one could be more on his side than what I've been.

Redknapp during the press conference that saw him hit out at Moroccan Taarabt . Redknapp, who recalled how he rescued Taarabt from Tottenham's reserves when he was Spurs boss, was hurt by comments made by the midfielder. Taarabt suggested Redknapp was rarely present on the training ground, something the QPR manager insisted was false. ""None of them were true,"" Redknapp added. ""I'm out on that training ground every single day. When people say I'm not out there all morning, that is a blatant lie. ""I think it might've been someone else trying to be mischievous and telling him what to say. ""Whatever. It's done and dusted. I just want to be positive now. ""I've had ups and downs with him before, but I've had more ups than downs with him. ""I've brought coaches in here that think I'm off my head for keep sticking with him and trying to get him onside.

"Unfortunately, there was not nearly as much action on the pitch in Lille as there had been in the French city’s main square earlier in the day. Everton manager Roberto Martinez will be pleased enough that another away draw in the Europa League leaves his side top of Group H with two of their remaining three games at home. But 7,000 travelling Evertonians had precious little to get excited about inside Stade Pierre-Mauroy after a tough 24 hours which saw some of them attacked by hooded hooligans and others tear-gassed by police.

Subs not used: Robles (Gk), Gibson, Coleman, Alcaraz . Booked: Besic, Pienaar . Referee: Manuel De Sousa (Portugal) 6.5 . Man of the match: Simon Kjaer . Martinez blamed the heavy pitch for stopping the game coming to life, but equally the two young stars of the show also failed to shine. Ross Barkley, on his European debut, was caught by an elbow, forcing him to play most of the first half with a head bandage before having stitches at half-time. Likewise, Lille’s £10million striker Divock Origi, on loan from Liverpool and the likely long-term replacement for Mario Balotelli, showed flashes of promise but was generally well marshalled by Phil Jagielka. He did not look the immediate answer to Brendan Rodgers’ Anfield goalscoring problems. Martinez was proud of the way his side tamed the 19-year-old. He said: ‘Origi is a talent. He has pace but he needs space to be at his best and we stopped his service, particularly the two centre backs.’ Martinez has been accused of being defensively naive so will take pleasure from grinding out draws in Krasnodar and Lille to go with the 4-1 home win over Wolfsburg, leaving Everton odds-on to reach the knockout stages. Pre-match talk was of the police raid on the city-centre Grand Place during the afternoon, in which pepper spray and tear gas were used to disperse Everton fans. One elderly supporter went to hospital with a head wound after being hit by a gas canister and English supporters said the police had been heavy-handed. On Wednesday night, a group of Everton fans were victims of an attack by a hooded gang in a local bar and two ended up in hospital with minor facial wounds. Martinez spoke after the game of his ‘immense pride’ in seeing so many ‘Bluenoses’ at the game in France to support their team. ‘It has brought me closer to understanding what the club means,’ he said.

The Everton midfielder had to leave the field of play with blood pouring from a wound above his left eye .

It was a shame his players were unable to repay their fans with a flowing performance. They had only two genuine chances. The first saw the ball bounce unkindly for Samuel Eto’o in the first half and then Aiden McGeady finished weakly when set up by substitute Romelu Lukaku. Lille, eighth in the French league but with the joint-best defensive record, had more chances but Origi shot wide after racing past Tony Hibbert and Leighton Baines. ‘I was pleased we put in a solid performance,’ said Martinez. ‘We had some opportunities, but not as many as I would like. So you’d have to say I am half-satisfied.’ Martinez said before the game that European football would help Barkley’s development by setting new tactical challenges for the midfielder.

It was an astute observation because this was not Barkley’s best showing in a blue shirt. In mitigation he suffered a nasty cut over his left eye in the first half. ‘It seems by an elbow or forearm,’ said Martinez. ‘I don’t think it was malicious but if the referee had seen it, the Lille player would have been punished.’ The game was so tight that a penalty appeal against Leighton Baines after 57 minutes caused a bit of afters when referee Manuel De Sousa turned it down. Franck Beria remonstrated, much to the annoyance of Everton’s Steven Pienaar, and after other players joined the mini-melee both men were cautioned. On Origi, Lille manager Rene Girard gave a curt 'No' when asked whether he could be fast-tracked at Anfield in January, but he promised Liverpool fans: ‘He is a great striker in the making. Tonight there wasn’t a lot of difference between him and the more experienced strikers Eto’o and Lukaku.

"Lille's Europa League game with Everton on Thursday night proved to be rather uneventful as the Blues secured a well-earned 0-0 draw in France to keep them top of Group H ahead of Wolfsburg. However, unfortunately scenes off the pitch marred the Toffees' trip, with trouble first erupting on Wednesday in Lille's main square as up to 100 hooded hooligans attacked visiting supporters, before there was more unprovoked violence on Thursday. Here Sportsmail's Ashley Clements talks you through his version of events as the shocking violence erupted near him in the main square. I was standing to the side of Lille’s main square with Everton fans. We were enjoying each other’s company and a football was being kicked around the centre. The first sign of trouble came when several bottles started to be thrown and a blue flare was released by the visiting fans.

"Everton boss Roberto Martinez expressed his 'immense pride' for the club’s 'incredible' fans after a turbulent 24 hours building up to Thursday evening’s 0-0 Europa League draw at Lille. The contest had been preceded by trouble in the French city involving Toffees supporters, including an attack on some of them at a bar by a group of at least 50 men on Wednesday night, and a subsequent flare-up in the main square around Thursday lunchtime which saw French police use gas against them. The Group H game itself was witnessed by around 5,500 Everton fans in the away end of the Stade Pierre-Mauroy, but there was talk that as many as twice that amount in total had made the trip to Lille. Almost 6,000 Everton fans were in the away end of the Stade Pierre-Mauroy to see their side secure a 0-0 draw . Some Everton supporters were caught up in clashes with riot police ahead of the Europa League clash . Everton manager Roberto Martinez was extremely complimentary of his side's travelling support in Lille . Martinez did not comment on the specific incidents of trouble that had occurred, saying in his post-match press conference when asked about them: 'I heard something was reported, but don’t know any details about it.' But he also said with regard to the fans: 'I can only speak from my point of view and the first thing I feel is immense pride and an incredible feeling of seeing what we are as a football club. 'The support doesn’t stop amazing me day to day - it is incredible. 'I have seen full families coming across, some without tickets just wanting to be near the hotel and wish the players well. 'It really meant something for thousands of them, and you keep getting closer to understanding what the Evertonians deserve. Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard pays tribute to the visiting supporters after the final whistle in Lille . Everton stalwart Tony Hibbert vies for the ball with on-loan Liverpool youngster Divock Origi . 'I would say this will be an incredible memory and that we will be talking about this trip for a long time. 'It gives even more strength to everyone at the club to keep fighting, making sure Everton can carry on progressing and keep having nights like this and success. The support we have is quite unique around Europe.' Martinez was pleased enough to secure a point that takes his side to five from three Group H games and keeps them top of the pool. But he was critical of the state of the pitch and admitted he could only really be half-satisfied given his team - like Lille - had not been able to create much in attack. Martinez had particular praise for Phil Jagielka, who did a fine job of keeping at bay the likes of  Origi . Ross Barkley was ordered off the field of play after sustaining a cut above his left eye in the 0-0 draw . 'For us, it is about performing well and getting a positive result,' the Spaniard said. 'I was pleased in terms of players coming in (he made six changes to his first XI) and performing to a high standard, but I think the pitch didn’t help either side - I think with a better pitch, we would have seen a lot more brilliant attacking football from both. I think all in all a draw was a fair result. 'If you could measure the pleasure at the end of the performance, it would be at 50 per cent because I thought we were fantastic defensively. But I did think we couldn’t be ourselves (going forward) - the condition of the pitch didn’t allow us to take risks.' Martinez had particular praise for Everton skipper Phil Jagielka, who did a fine job of keeping at bay the likes of Divock Origi, the forward loaned back to Lille after joining Liverpool over the summer. The manager said of centre-back Jagielka: 'Nothing affects his level of performance. 'I think the last few weeks he has been immense. I do think he is a step ahead of where he was before.' Martinez also confirmed Toffees midfielder Ross Barkley required stitches for a head injury but is expected to be fine for Sunday’s Barclays Premier League trip to Burnley. 'It was a cut on his eyebrow and he was bleeding heavily,' Martinez said. 'I think there was a collision - an elbow or forearm. 'The Lille player was trying to block his run and caught him. I don’t think it was anything really malicious, but I think if the referee had seen it, he would have been punished.'","The Everton manager hailed the club's supporters who travelled to France .

"Anyone who still believes that the Europa League is merely a distraction to a team’s domestic campaign need look no further than Everton’s passionate travelling contingent in Lille on Thursday. Huge numbers were being reported on Twitter on Wednesday morning, some claiming close to 20,000 away fans would be descending on the French city in anticipation of their team’s Group H clash against 2011 Ligue 1 champions, Lille. Although the final figure may have been closer to 10,000, there’s no doubt that the flame of the Europa League burns brightly on the blue side of Merseyside and that became clear to see inside the Stade Pierre-Mauroy on Thursday night. Around 10,000 Everton fans made the 300 mile journey to Lille to watch their side in Europa League action . Everton fans are revelling in their club's first European adventure since the 2009/10 season . Everton fans took over the main square in Lille ahead of their side's goalless draw in France . Blue shirts dominated almost two complete tiers of the stadium while hundreds of banners including the messages ‘Ross (Barkley) is boss’ and ‘Roberto (Martinez), we dream the same dream’ adorned the hoardings during a 0-0 draw which the Toffees remain top of their group. Although the Goodison Park faithful didn’t get the chance to celebrate a goal, Everton kept possession well and stuck to Martinez’s attacking style all while appreciating the importance of a draw away from home in Europe. Ross Barkley, who had to play with a bandage wrapped around his head for the majority of his European debut after an early collision, took to Twitter to praise the Everton fans. He tweeted: ’Good point and clean sheet, travelling fans were outstanding as always’. Unfortunately for Everton’s travelling contingent, what should be remembered as a brilliant away trip was slightly marred by two separate events which saw around 100 hooded Lille fans stage an unprovoked attack on unsuspecting Blues fans outside a bar on Wednesday night. Police arrived on the scene within minutes, but eye witnesses reported a number of injuries with some Everton fans suffering bloodied head wounds. A doorman at the Australian Bar told the Liverpool Echo: ’The Lille hooligans just appeared from the Place Louise de Bettignies across the road, from a side street, and just ran at the pub. There were some Everton fans outside smoking and they got caught cold. ‘The hooligans picked up chairs we had stacked up outside and attacked them while others used them to smash windows and try to get inside.’ The atmosphere was largely friendly but pockets of violence broke out on both Wednesday and Thursday .

A second incident occurred on Thursday afternoon as fans soaked up the pre-match atmosphere in the heart of Lille’s city centre before riot police released three tear gas bombs while charging towards what they clearly believed to be a unruly group of Everton fans. The general consensus in the aftermath of both incidents seemed to be that the away support had been the victims of their second unprovoked attack in as many days as the official Everton Twitter account warned fans to stay away from the area. The club tweeted on Thursday afternoon: ‘We advise Everton fans in Lille to avoid the main square in the city centre.’ Fortunately, there seemed to be no further incidents after the game itself as Sportsmail reporter Elliott Bretland took to Twitter to reveal some fun and games between fans and police. He wrote: ‘Police had a microphone to speak to fans at metro... a fan grabs it and starts: ‘60 grand, Seamus Coleman’... They let him do two choruses!’ At any rate, the Evertonians didn’t let the two isolated incidents dampen their spirits as they travelled in their numbers to fill out their 5,000 seat allocation as well as popping up in several pockets within the home support. Both sets of fans traded chants during the early stages of the game itself before a spell of pressure from the home side saw Lille fans turn the volume up to 11 inside the 50,0000 capacity Stade Pierre-Mauroy.

Leighton Baines and Samuel Eto'o applaud the visiting fans who made the journey in large numbers . Not to be outdone, Everton fans got behind their team with several renditions of ‘Allez, Allez, Allez, Oh’ despite an at times nervy performance from Martinez’s side. Speaking shortly after the game, Blues boss Martinez also took time to praise the fans, while claiming their support will drive Everton’s push for European glory. He said: ‘It amazes me every day, the day-to-day support we receive. ‘It gives everybody at the Club more strength to keep progressing and to keep having more nights like this in Europe, because that is what our fans deserve.’ Unfortunately for the fans in blue, Everton couldn’t quite build on their impressive 3-0 against Aston Villa last weekend as Divick Origi and Co looked like a lively proposition, particularly for the first 45 minutes. Liverpool loanee Origi will have endeared himself to his parent club with an impressive performance against his Merseyside rivals to be. The young Belgian’s highlight came in the 20th minute as he skipped past Leighton Baines before storming away from Sylvain Distin in a move that will have left Reds fans salivating. With the Europa League being the gateway to the Champions League for the first time, Everton fans know going all the way this season will hand Martinez’s side a spot at Europe’s top table, which each Toffee will tell you is well worth the 320-mile trip to northern France. Their Road to Warsaw may have only just begun but Everton players have been given a fantastic reason to care about this competition. The passion and desire shown from the blue side of Merseyside was something to behold and may just see Martinez collect his first major trophy as Blues boss.

There will not be posters commemorating this victory in the match-day programme next week and the travelling fans are unlikely to have their ticket prices refunded. But this victory over a solid Stoke side was every bit as important as last week’s 8-0 thrashing of Sunderland. It lifts Southampton to an unlikely second in the table after nine games, two points clear of reigning champions Manchester City. It also extends the best defensive record in all four tiers of English football, with just five goals conceded and only one of those at St Mary’s.

Player ratings from MARTHA KELNER at St Mary's . ‘This win was more difficult than last week and maybe even nicer,’ said manager Ronald Koeman. ‘It will be nice to enjoy the table on Sunday and it’s good for the fans to see but on Monday we go back to work. The clean sheet is very important.’ Not many would have predicted such smooth sailing on the south coast after the mass exodus of players in the summer. But Graziano Pelle, Dusan Tadic and Toby Alderweireld have proved rich assets in the absence of Adam Lallana, Ricky Lambert and Dejan Lovren. ‘We deserved the win,’ said Koeman. ‘The lads showed great ambition and in the first half we were even better than last week. Maybe people are not surprised any more about our qualities.’ Since joining Southampton after the departure of Mauricio Pochettino, it seems Koeman can do no wrong. The one change he made after that decimation of Sunderland was bringing Saido Mane into the starting line up. The Senegalese midfielder repaid the favour, tormenting Phil Bardsley down the left flank before putting the Saints ahead on 33 minutes. Mane, 22, had his first Premier League goal scored against Sunderland last week harshly taken from him by the dubious goals panel. There can be no doubt about this one. He leapt onto the rebound after Pelle’s shot ricocheted off the post and fired powerfully past Asmir Begovic. Southampton recaptured the invention and vigour of last Saturday’s historic victory and within 10 minutes had recorded five shots on target. Pelle and Tadic, who played against each other in the Dutch league last season, linked up as if they have been team-mates for years and Mane fitted in seamlessly. Bought from Salzburg for £11.8million, he collected the ball from outside the box in the third minute and curled in a useful cross which Pelle strained for but could not reach.

Peter Crouch headed wide from a promising Steven N’Zonzi cross. Then the talented Victor Moses made a mazy run into the box but could not muster an end product, his weak attempt easily saved by Fraser Forster. Ryan Shawcross was also unfortunate to be booked by referee Jon Moss for changing his boots on the pitch. Stoke substitute Mame Biram Diouf had their best chance to level proceedings when supplied with a brilliant cross by Bardsley, however, his right-footed shot from very close range missed to the left of the target. ‘If he makes contact then possibly we could have taken something out of the game,’ said Stoke manager Mark Hughes, . 'From our point of view, we're a little bit disappointed with the first half, really. 'We didn't really ask enough questions of Southampton, made it a little bit too easy, showed them a little too much respect, I would suggest, which is understandable to a certain extent given their exploits last time out here. 'I think that was the case in the first half. They caused us a few problems at set plays and obviously from one of the ones we didn't deal with it dropped handily for them and they've been able to dispatch the winning goal. 'Second half, I thought we were a lot better. We made a change very early on, got Mame Diouf on, and that gave us a threat in behind and that stretched the game.

'All available reports suggest that the first incident, on the night before the game, was an unprovoked and planned attack by local youths. 'The second incident, early in the afternoon on matchday, in the city's main square, quickly escalated into unwelcome and unpleasant scenes.

Everton say the trouble started when a plainclothes officers went to arrest a supporter who was misbehaving. Visiting fans thought it was local Lille follower giving the man hassle and retaliated. He ran from police and it sparked the confrontation which led to CS gas and pepper spray being used. The supporter, who was taken off to hospital in an ambulance, had a  bloodied gash above his left eye that came from a a CS Gas canister that was fired by police. Back in the square, a loud bang rattled through the area as the police let off the first of three tear gas bombs. With shields covering their bodies, the police move aggressively through a group of Everton fans, knocking one to the ground as the second tear gas bomb was released. Fans were left rubbing their eyes and sneezing, and they attempted to flee the scene as bottles flew across the square. Several fans seemed extremely shaken by the events and the majority  felt they had been victims of another unprovoked attack. One fan shouted, 'they've got rubber bullets', which the police reportedly used to stem any further aggression from either set of fans, although there were no Lille fans in sight. The away support certainly seemed to be the victims as the mood in the square had been a pleasant one for the majority of the afternoon.

"The Champions League group stage reached the half-way point this week with a series of entertaining and goal-laden matches. We cast our eye over the eight groups to see who's cruising through and who still has work to do in order to reach the knockout stage. GROUP A . Italian champions Juventus have work to do if they are to avoid a repeat of last season's group stage exit. Their 1-0 defeat by Olympiacos on Wednesday night leaves them third in the group and heaps pressure on Massimiliano Allegri's side to get a result in the return match in Turin the week after next. The Greeks have looked strong at home and that has been enough to offset a 2-0 loss in Malmo and put them top of the group at the midway stage. Spanish champions and last season's runners-up Atletico Madrid lost in Greece on the opening matchday but back-to-back home victories have put them in a strong position.

Real Madrid's masterful performance on Merseyside has put them on the brink of qualification for the knockout stages with three wins from three. The defending champions beat Basle 5-1 at the Bernabeu on matchday one and then recovered from an early scare to beat Ludogorets Razgrad 2-1 in Bulgaria. A win against Liverpool in the return match on November 4 will seal their progress. The Bulgarian debutants are actually second on goal difference following their 1-0 success over Basle this week, while Liverpool in third place and Basle in fourth also have three points.

The German team have defied their poor league form to win all three matches so far, racking up nine goals without conceding. They will ensure their place in the last 16 if they complete the double over Galatasaray on matchday four. Lukas Podolski's late winner in Brussels has completely changed Arsenal's outlook and a win over Anderlecht at the Emirates in two weeks will put them in a very strong position.

Bayern Munich are cruising to top spot in Group E with their incredible 7-1 win in Rome opening up a five-point cushion at the top. Three points in the return match with Roma at the Allianz Arena in two weeks will ensure their progress and it is then a shoot-out between the Italians and Manchester City as to who will follow them. City, who surrendered a two-goal lead against CSKA Moscow on Tuesday, ideally need maximum points from their next two home games to advance.

So despite being an England Under 21 international, Dier has had a crash course education in English life over the last few weeks. He told The Sun on Sunday: 'I was very young when I went to Portugal and don't remember anything about living here previously. All I remember from childhood is living in Portugal. 'Living here feels very strange. I feel like I am in a new country. 'I didn't even know the clocks were going back until a secretary at the club told me on Thursday. She told me that it will get dark here at about 4pm. I didn't know that. Dier had lived in Portugal since the age of eight and played for Sporting Lisbon until the summer . Dier made the perfect start to life at Tottenham by scoring the late winner at West Ham on the opening day . 'They don't do that in Portugal. I thought she was having me on at first. Nobody told me that when I signed!' It can only be hoped as winter descends that Dier finds his way to White Hart Lane in time for Sunday's 1.30pm kick-off with Newcastle United. But there have been no such problems on the pitch, with Dier starting nine matches for Spurs this season in the Premier League and the Europa League. Dier is an England Under 21 international and is expected to play in next summer's European Championship . He admits England's top flight is a step up from Portugal's but is well equipped to cope. 'Teams counter very quickly against us,' he said. 'So you have to get used to having long spells of possession and then reacting really quickly when you lose the ball. 'So you have to be switched on at all times, otherwise you can get caught out.' Tottenham have been caught out on a few occasions so far this season but sit 10th in the standings ahead of Newcastle's visit.","Eric Dier has impressed for Tottenham since joining in the summer .

'The club has been made aware of an isolated incident in a bar in Lille on Wednesday evening in which a number of Evertonians were attacked by a group of around 50 local men. 'The club understands that two Everton fans suffered minor facial injuries and were taken to the local hospital and that this was the only incident in what was otherwise a good-natured evening in the city centre. 'The club are in continual contact with Merseyside police officers who are in Lille today (Thursday) and the city's police representatives. 'Supporters travelling to tonight's match are advised to utilise the travel information provided on the official website where updates on any safety matters will also be provided.' Fans rushed from the square rubbing their eyes after large explosions were set off and tear gas thrown, onlookers claim. One fan even alleged the trouble started when Everton fans were singing an ode to right back Seamus Coleman - only for riot police to storm into the main square. The Toffees' official Twitter account also sent out a message saying: 'We advise Everton fans in Lille to avoid the main square in the city centre.' Official confirmation is being sought on the alleged actions of the police. This occurred after a group of Everton fans were attacked in a seemingly unprovoked attack in Lille city centre late on Wednesday night. Up to 100 hooded Lille supporters ambushed English fans drinking outside the city's Australian bar close to 10pm local time after a peaceful day in the northern French city in which supporters of both clubs seemed to be getting along. Police arrived on the scene within minutes to disperse the trouble with gas but eye witnesses reported a number of injuries with some Everton fans suffering bloodied head wounds. Early reports say the attack started when a group of visiting fans were smoking outside the bar and were attacked by an apparently well-organised group of French hooligans. A doorman at the bar told the Liverpool Echo: 'The atmosphere was nice all day. The Everton fans were singing, showing us their flags and having fun. All very respectful. In the evening they watched the Liverpool game and towards the end of that match it happened. It was bad. 'The Lille hooligans just appeared from the Place Louise de Bettignies across the road, from a side street, and just ran at the pub. There were some Everton fans outside smoking and they got caught cold. 'The hooligans picked up chairs we had stacked up outside and attacked them while others used them to smash windows and try to get inside. 'We had to try and stop the Everton supporters inside from getting out to help because it would have got far worse. I went out to try and drag them in. Everton boss Roberto Martinez spoke to the media ahead of his side's third Europa League group game . Toffees keeper Tim Howard gestures during his side's training session at Lille's stadium on Wednesday . 'I saw one older English guy being punched by about three Lille hooligans. His face was bleeding badly. I am so sorry for what happened.' Windows were smashed forcing the bar to be closed early as police waded in to quell the trouble, although some Everton fans complained of heavy-handed treatment. TV commentator Sam Matterface, who will be covering the game for ITV4 on Thursday alongside pundit Clarke Carlisle, said: 'Not a great night in the Australian Bar in Lille. EFC (Everton) fans claiming they were attacked . We walked into it late - blue lights, police, gas.' The sudden burst of violence was in contrast to a pleasant day in Lille when the first of several thousand Everton fans expected for the match arrived by plane or at the Eurostar train terminal. There may be up to 7,000 fans from Merseyside in town by kick-off and police are certain to up their presence and may seek to impose an alcohol ban around the stadium.","Flares set off in Lille's main square on Thursday as Everton fans gather .

"Click here to see more of our brilliant Match Zone, including an impressive 25-pass build-up for Lukaku's goal . When Roberto Martinez met Samuel Eto’o one Sunday in late August for a coffee, there was only one question he wanted answering. Did he have the hunger to play on a cold afternoon in the North West, when the going was tough and the environment was unforgiving? Everton’s manager never had a concern about Eto’o’s quality but he needed to see if the desire was still there. Eto’o has never given Martinez a moment to think he made a wrong move but his decision was vindicated once again at blustery Turf Moor, as his two goals inspired Everton to a comfortable 3-1 victory over Burnley. VIDEO Scroll down to see Roberto Martinez on his side's performance . Samuel Eto'o's stunning curled effort ensured Everton's three points late on... the goal was his second of the afternoon .

As Eto’o left the pitch with the acclaim of 4,000 travelling Evertonians ringing in his ears, a number of Martinez’s managerial peers — not least Brendan Rodgers — may well have been regretting that they allowed the chance to sign him slip away. He may be 33 but he still has much to offer. ‘I like Samuel when he is in that type of form,’ said Martinez, who saw Romelu Lukaku atone for the mistake that gifted Burnley a goal by scoring Everton’s second. ‘He can play anywhere. He brings real know-how and experience. Sometimes, you want to develop young players. 'But he can give them a lot of aspects technically, tactically and physically. There’s few people who can teach things like Samuel due to his experience. 'Everyone will speak about the goals but I was so pleased with the performance he had, his role off the ball and the way he worked hard for the team. ‘He has set real standards and I’m really pleased. He has played two games in a week, but his performance was a real example. What an incredible professional to have in a dressing room full of young players.’ That point is key. Some will carp and say Eto’o has thrived against a side who are heading back to the Championship but that overlooks the fact that he arrived on Merseyside as one of a select group who have won the Champions League at two different clubs. The moment he walked into Goodison Park, Eto’o — once of Barcelona and Internazionale —had the respect of his new team-mates and he was a calming influence here, always making the right decision and using the ball sensibly. He set a tone that was the catalyst for a clinical performance. In order to give his team some freshness following their midweek trip to Lille, Martinez made six changes to Everton’s starting line-up and his reward was a blistering start that left Burnley frantically trying to catch their breath. Samuel Eto'o worked his socks off in Everton’s win at Turf Moor. Far from his more familiar role as a target man, he played as an attacking midfielder in support of Romelu Lukaku. Though nominally playing down the left, he roved across the width of the pitch, as the heat map of his main areas of activity shows (below). And he put in a shift in his own box for corners too. Not too shabby for a 33-year-old. Romelu Lukaku celebrates after putting his side 2-1 up at Turf Moor on Sunday afternoon .

When Everton’s passing clicks, they are an impressive side to watch and never was that more apparent than in the fourth minute as the ball zipped from one white shirt to another, sweeping the length of the pitch. The move culminated in Gareth Barry sending Leighton Baines scampering down the left and the England full back’s inch-perfect cross was given the finish it deserved, as Eto’o’s bullet header thudded against the underside of the bar before hitting the back of Tom Heaton’s net. Burnley were startled by Everton’s speed out of the blocks but gradually they regained composure themselves and they received an expected gift in the 20th minute that enabled them to secure parity. Everton were in no danger when Romelu Lukaku took possession just by the halfway line but, carelessly and inexplicably, he gave the ball to Lukas Jutkiewicz, who wasted no time sending Danny Ings away. The England Under 21 striker did the rest, rounding Tim Howard and finishing with aplomb. Much to Burnley’s frustration, however, it wasn’t long before they conceded cheaply once again. They had only been on terms for eight minutes when Steven Naismith found Lukaku in the area and he made up for his aberration with a shot that bobbled beyond Heaton.

Danny Ings cups his ears to the Burnley fans after levelling the scores in Burnley's Premier League match on Sunday . Ings strikes to ball to make the score 1-1, to the frustration of onlooking duo Gareth Barry and Tim Howard . This was Everton’s first victory over Burnley at Turf Moor for 44 years. It was also the first time they have enjoyed successive league wins since April. Burnley worked hard after the break but, for all their huff and puff, they rarely looked like blowing Everton over and in the 85th minute they were seen off when Barry, Ross Barkley and Steven Pienaar combined to give Eto’o the chance to bend a drive in from 25 yards. Moments later, he rounded Heaton again but his shot from a tight angle bounced off the post. It was the only slight blip on an otherwise exemplary display. ‘It was a very challenging day against a fine team,’ said Sean Dyche, whose Burnley side are still winless. ‘Eto’o has been a fine player and still is. Everton had high-quality players doing what high-quality players do. We all wanted Premier League football but nobody said it’d be an easy ride.

"George Ford knows when it became obvious Toby Flood’s presence at Leicester Tigers became an obstacle to his dream of playing in next year’s World Cup — prompting him to sign for Bath 18 months ago. ‘It was when I wasn’t playing,’ he said this week. ‘I was getting in the 23 but only getting five minutes here and there. There were a run of games where I hardly played and just did a hell of a lot of training. ‘I just felt to progress I needed to play. Floody was playing quite well at the time but I felt there were opportunities throughout that couple of years where I felt I could have been given more of a shot. Bath's George Ford left Leicester last year because he wasn't getting picked ahead of Toby Flood . Flood has now moved to Toulouse and the pair will face each other on Sunday in the European Champions Cup . The Bath fly-half holds no animosity towards Flood but felt he had to leave Leicester for the sake of his career . ‘I probably understand why I wasn’t but I made the decision to move to give myself the best chance of playing.’ It was a bold decision for a 20-year-old. But it was a decision driven by a desire to deliver on the promise that had already seen the Oldham-born youngster become the first 16-year-old to play professional rugby union in England in 2009 before being named the International Rugby Board young player of the year the following season. But there’s no inkling of resentment towards Flood, who earned the majority of his 60 England caps during his time at Welford Road. Ford (right) has been selected by Stuart Lancaster for the England squad for the autumn internationals . George Ford found opportunities limited at Leicester due to Toby Flood’s presence, so the youngster moved to Bath to boost his chances of an England call-up. FORD AT LEICESTER (2010-13) Matches (starts): 26 (15) Points scored: 163 . Tries: 1 . Conversions: 19 . Penalties: 39 . Drop goals: 1 . England caps: 0 . FORD AT BATH (2013-present) Matches (starts): 27 (26) Points scored: 334 . Tries: 3 . Conversions: 50 . Penalties: 70 . Drop goals: 3 . England caps:2 . ‘We always kicked together so we spent a lot of time away from team sessions together,’ said Ford, 21. ‘I remember in the World Cup season (2011) we had a bad losing streak. Toby came back from New Zealand and we sat down and had a good chat about my performances. ‘He kept emphasising that I just had to go out and be myself, prepare well and have confidence in myself. Everything else will take care of itself. Don’t stress too much. He was very much a calming influence.’ The advice has paid off as richly as Ford’s move to Bath. This week — with Flood unavailable for selection after moving to Toulouse in France in the summer — the Bath No 10 was selected as one of three fly-halves alongside Owen Farrell and Stephen Myler in England’s 33-man squad named by head coach Stuart Lancaster for next month’s QBE autumn series. With Farrell inked in as first-choice for next year’s World Cup, and Ford still without an international start following his late withdrawal with a shoulder injury from the summer tour to New Zealand, it is inconceivable he won’t be handed a lead role in at least one Test next month. A strong showing on Saturday for the No 10 against Toulouse and his former club rival in the European Champions Cup at the Recreation Ground would be the perfect way for the youngster to sign off before the autumn Tests. Ford is pictured here back in 2012 playing for Leicester before he left Tigers to join current club Bath . Flood is unavailable for England selection after his move to French side Toulouse this summer . ‘I didn’t think I could be any more hungry,’ he said. ‘But to miss the tour, and be sat there at home in a sling watching the three Tests, it really made me realise how much I want to get to that level and come back in the summer, try to train as hard as I can and get my shoulder as fit as I could and start the season as well as I could at Bath. ‘I obviously want to be playing at that level and do everything I can to try to get there. I don’t know too much about international rugby yet — but I can only find out by playing. I definitely feel that if Stuart gives me a shot I’ll be ready.’ Their impressive start to the Aviva Premiership campaign, which has seen them chalk up 22 tries in six games, has convinced Lancaster that Ford is not the only Bath player ready. The England head coach named no fewer than seven in his squad with Semesa Rokoduguni, Jonathan Joseph, Dave Attwood, Rob Webber and David Wilson all starting on Saturday as the West Countrymen face one of the biggest games in the club’s recent history. Back in 2011, Ford celebrates beating France at the IRB Junior World Championship in Italy . Kyle Eastmond misses out with a rib injury while England Under 20 international Charlie Ewels, normally a lock, faces a baptism of fire as he makes his first start for the club, at No 8 against Toulouse’s star-studded international back-row of Louis Picamoles, Imanol Harinordoquy and Thierry Dusautoir. Bath’s back-to-back defeats at Wasps and last week away at Glasgow, in their opening Cup clash, have put even more emphasis on Saturday’s game against the four-time tournament winners. ‘We had some honest meetings on Monday when a lot of good things were said,’ Ford admitted. ‘A lot of people put their hands up and said it (the Glasgow performance) was unacceptable. We need to turn that around and quickly. The intensity of the training session we had on Tuesday was brilliant. ‘It wasn’t meant to be a full contact session but it turned out a bit like that because of the reaction we need and the intensity we need to get to at the weekend. People were on the edge. We need to be like that against Toulouse. The game has been built up and rightly so. We haven’t played a game this big for three or four years at the club. It is a massive challenge but we will give it our all this week.’","Bath take on Leicester at the Recreation Ground in the European Champions Cup on Saturday .

"Joe Launchbury has identified the key reason why he has spurned interest from Saracens and other clubs to sign his new contract with Wasps. The 23-year-old England lock was destined to become the subject of a transfer-market stampede had he not agreed terms before the new year, which would have allowed potential suitors to pursue him. Instead, following Wasps’ confirmation of their move to Coventry, Launchbury has signed for another three years. He pinpointed Dai Young, his director of rugby and a former Lions prop, as a major factor in that decision. England lock Joe Launchbury (above) has signed a contract extension with Premiership club Wasps . Launchbury has played 22 times for England since he joined Wasps from Worthing Rugby Club in 2009 . ‘I am really pleased to have extended with Wasps,’ said Launchbury. ‘There were a number of factors to consider, but uppermost in my mind was where I would become the best rugby player I could be. Also, with a baby on the way, where my family would be happiest long-term. Wasps is that place. ‘I love this club, I have huge respect for the players and coaches and continuing to work with Dai Young was a huge factor. He is so knowledgeable about the game and I feel I have learnt so much from him.’ Approval for Wasps’ purchase of a 50 per cent stake in the Ricoh Arena as their new home — ending years of a nomadic existence — was another major factor. Launchbury added: ‘Since I have been at Wasps, we as a club have searched for our own home and to have finally secured that is massive. It has proved the ambition chairman Derek Richardson and the club have to re-establish ourselves as one of Europe’s most successful clubs. Launchbury (centre) has started England's last 19 tests and will play a crucial role at the 2015 World Cup . ‘When I saw the plans for our new training base I was blown away by the standard of facilities Wasps players will have access to on a daily basis. This is very much an environment and culture I believe in and I want to be part of it.’ Young was ecstatic, having told Sportsmail earlier this season of his belief that the club would manage to keep hold of Launchbury, their ‘crown jewel’. ‘I am over the moon that Joe has decided to stay at Wasps,’ he said. ‘It is a significant reflection of the positive direction the club is moving in that we have retained a player of his calibre and reputation within the world game. I’m not daft, I know how sought after Joe is in world rugby and imagine he will have had clubs lining up to talk to him about possibly joining them. It’s not simply Joe’s talent which marks him out as a world-class player, it is also his attitude and commitment to the team. Launchbury said the presence of Dai Young (above) was an important factor in him signing a new deal . ‘He is a very loyal and down-to-earth guy. He has weighed up all options and decided Wasps is the best place for him.’ Meanwhile, Wales centre Jonathan Davies has admitted that he needs to raise his game after a disappointing start at his new club Clermont Auvergne in France. The 26-year-old Lion was hampered by a foot injury after his move from the Scarlets, but said: ‘That shouldn’t serve as an excuse. I must do better, I know that.’ Davies — who has been recalled for Sunday’s visit of Sale, after missing the defeat at Saracens last Saturday — revealed that his coach, Franck Azema, has been brutally honest in assessing his contribution for Clermont so far. Davies added: ‘He’s been very clear with me. My performances have not been good enough and he’s waiting for a lot more from me. He’s right. I’m also frustrated with my performances. I must improve.’ Kurtley Beale has been allowed to join the Wallabies for their autumn internationals after avoiding the sack . Maverick Australia back Kurtley Beale has been cleared to join the Wallabies’ tour of Europe after being fined AU$45,000 (£24,500) but avoiding the sack at a tribunal on Friday. He was found guilty of a serious breach of conduct for sending an offensive photograph to an ARU employee. ‘I will work to regain the respect of my team-mates, fans and the general Australian community,’ said Beale in a statement. ‘I am satisfied with tonight’s outcome. There was conjecture about my contract being terminated, however the tribunal agreed that, on the basis of the evidence, a fine was appropriate. I’m relieved there is no termination and no suspension and I can now continue playing rugby.’","Joe Launchbury has signed a contract extension with Wasps .

"Vernon Kay looks ahead to the second International Series game at Wembley this season as the Detroit Lions take on the Atlanta Falcons. Detroit head into the game in with a 5-2 record atop the NFC North, and they’ll be looking for another win against a Falcons team that have lost their last four games. Everyone knows that the Atlanta Falcons are struggling with their offensive line and that is going to be a major issue at Wembley on Sunday. The Detroit Lions have the No 1 defense in the league and are only conceding 15 points per game. This could be a blowout by the Lions, but it could be a close game if the Falcons defense can step up to the mark. The Atlanta Falcons have been struggling with their offensive line ahead of the clash with the Detroit Lions . Detroit vs Atlanta, 1.30pm . Seattle at Carolina, 5pm . Baltimore at Cincinnati, 5pm . Miami at Jacksonville, 5pm . St Louis at Kansas City, 5pm . Chicago at New England, 5pm . Buffalo at New York Jets, 5pm . Minnesota at Tampa Bay, 5pm . Houston at Tennessee, 5pm . Philadelphia at Arizona, 8.05pm . Oakland at Cleveland, 8.25pm . Indianapolis at Pittsburgh, 8.25pm . Green Bay at New Orleans, 12.30am . Detroit have a formidable force up front on defense. When you watch the game live on Channel 4 at 1.30pm, make sure you look out for defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh. I was fortunate enough to meet him this week at an NFL event at NikeTown and he is a monster. He is nearly 23 stone of pure muscle and three times as wide as I am. I’m 6’4” and weigh 221lbs, but this guy literally dwarfed me and put me in a shadow as big as a solid oak tree. Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan will have to establish his passing game early but, because of the amount of pressure that Suh and Nick Fairley are putting on quarterbacks, the Lions defensive backs are having a field day. The Lions have had 21 sacks and eight interceptions so far this season. This Sunday is the first time ever that an NFL regular-season game will start as early as 9.30am Eastern Time. I’ve been fortunate enough to be at functions where the NFL have really played on the fact that we have an early kick-off. It is something they want to experiment with and see if there’s a market and an audience for a breakfast game in the States. If it gets good viewing figures, we may see future London International Series games being midday or 1pm kick-offs. Calvin ‘Megatron’ Johnson is doubtful for the game and it will be a massive coup for the NFL if he plays on the hallowed turf at Wembley. He is a superstar and was on the cover of the game Madden, which is always a sign of respect. Johnson is tall, strong powerful and can run like the wind. He studies opposition so well to the point where he can manipulate them with the way he moves. Calvin Johnson is a doubt for the clash at Wembley but it will be a massive coup should he play on Sunday . I spoke to Detroit quarterback Matt Stafford this week. I said to him: ‘No disrespect, but if I was Detroit Lions quarterback I would just throw the ball in Megatron’s direction.’ Stafford was laughing and said ‘absolutely, that’s all I do.’ Everyone thought Megatron would be a massive loss for the Lions but his replacements Golden Tate and Corey Fuller have really stepped up to the mark. What is opening people’s eyes is that the Lions have proved they can be successful without Megatron. At running back, Reggie Bush seems to have settled and Joique Bell is taking the workload off him too. Their quarterback Stafford is a former first-round draft pick and has high expectations on his shoulders. He said this week that the transition of having a new head coach (Jim Caldwell) is always difficult, but everyone seems to have knuckled down as a team. You have to tip your cap to coach Caldwell and the offense for being so successful without Megatron. Golden Tate (pictured against New Orleans) has stepped up in the absence of 'Megatron' for the Detroit Lions . Everyone thought they were a one-threat team, but who knows what is going to happen when Megatron comes back… hopefully this week at Wembley. The Falcons are struggling at 2-5 and I feel sorry for quarterback Ryan. He was expected to have a phenomenal year but they have had such a slow start with injuries and key players out on the offensive line. But they are still in the mix in the NFC South. It is a division that is really lacking in consistency and being led by a Carolina Panthers team at 3-3-1. I think it’s going to be a really close-fought division, but I wouldn’t count out the Saints. Each team in this division needs to get some momentum going. If whoever wins it ends up at 8-8, they’re not going to go much further than Wild Card weekend. WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR AT WEMBLEY . 1. We are going to be in for a serious aerial bombardment. We have got two great quarterbacks who have established themselves in the NFL and can both throw the football in Stafford and Ryan. 2. If Megatron doesn’t play, look out for Tate. He is a former Seattle Seahawk and won a Super Bowl ring last year. Tate’s arrival has helped the Lions establish another aerial threat outside of Megatron. 3. Anyone who loves sport for the athleticism of the game, look out for Steven Jackson. The man is absolutely huge. When he puts his shoulder down, it is very difficult for defenders to stop him. I’m excited to see how he can run the ball. SUPERDOME SHOWDOWN . The Green Bay Packers visit the New Orleans Saints in the late game on Channel 4 on Sunday. The Saints are struggling, but it is always a joy to watch Drew Brees. But the Packers are flying at the moment and, if Aaron Rodgers can do what he has been doing in previous games, this will be a two-score win for Green Bay. Last week there was a really positive debate on my Twitter feed about what defines the best quarterback. Peyton Manning has defined himself as the best quarterback the league has ever seen from a statistical point of view - but he has only got one Super Bowl ring. Rodgers is definitely in the group just below Manning and my favourite Tom Brady. What he brings to the team is an air of calmness. He is a real leader, but from a different angle. He uses a relaxed approach to the game and just lets his skills do the talking. Vernon Kay presents NFL: The American Football Show, Mondays at 11.50pm on Channel 4.

"Saracens suffered a fate that has become familiar to so many top European teams over the years at Thomond Park, as they were pounded into submission by Munster, after a costly yellow card for Rhys Gill. The Aviva Premiership side came here with considerable belief and they were in the hunt for much of an abrasive Pool One tie. Mark McCall’s visitors had shown plenty of their warrior spirit and the fiery competitive streak of their ‘Wolf-pack’ defence, but the tipping point – quite literally – came in the 52nd minute as Welsh prop Gill was sin-binned for wildly up-ending CJ Stander at a ruck. Before that telling incident, the force increasingly had been with Saracens in a tight tussle, which was locked at 3-3. But by the time Gill returned to the field, the challenge of the English team had been fatally undermined, as they trailed by eight points and had emphatically conceded the initiative. From then on, the outcome was inevitable. Rhys Gill of Saracens is shown a yellow card by referee Jerome Garces during the 14-3 defeat vs Munster . Mark McCall, the Saracens director of rugby, looks on during the 14-3 defeat against Munster on Friday night . ‘The yellow card was a real momentum-swinger,’ said McCall, Saracens’ director of rugby. ‘The decision (by the referee) was fair enough – you can’t tip people above the horizontal in the air. It was an accident, but Munster took advantage of it, as they do. Once they were ahead, it wasn’t a night for playing catch-up rugby.’ This was an important night for England fly-half Owen Farrell, who was making just his second start of the season, having missed three matches with a quad injury. He landed one of his two goal kicks, committed himself with gusto in defence and for a spell began to find some passing rhythm. He was also evidently trying to play close to the Munster defensive line, whenever the opportunity arose. But this was not a game which allowed him to click through the gears and he occasionally appeared to be moving with a lack of freedom – with the recently-damaged leg still strapped. Yet, McCall was satisfied with his playmaker, saying: ‘I thought he did well. ‘It was hard to be our No 10 tonight because we didn’t have a lot of ball, but when we did we looked dangerous. Owen played the full 80 minutes, which was important for him.’ It was an important night for Owen Farrell, making his second start of an injury-interrupted early-season period . It was Farrell’s first full 80-minute outing this season on Friday and England will be relieved at that news . It was Farrell’s first full 80-minute outing this season and England will be relieved that he has had that precious game-time, providing he doesn’t suffer any repercussions in the aftermath. While that was good news for national coach Stuart Lancaster, he will also have been heartened to see how some of his squad members performed in a match which reached Test intensity at times. This was a full-throttle game in a hostile atmosphere and that experience will benefit new England lock George Kruis, who appeared to cope well with the occasion. Billy Vunipola was especially prominent for Saracens, but he withdrew in the closing stages after a bang to the head. The No 8 didn’t appear to be in a bad way, but the national management will be keen to assess him on Sunday, in the hope that he is fully fit to join the start of the pre-QBE series preparations in Surrey. Paul O'Connell (left) of Munster jumps for the ball against Saracens' George Kruis during the hot-blooded tie . It was a full-throttle game in a hostile atmosphere but new England lock Kruis appeared to cope well . Friday night’s defeat was a setback for Saracens but by no means a devastating blow to their hopes of qualifying for the knock-out stages. They were attempting to turn the tide of history in Europe’s final frontier – where the hopes of visiting teams come to die. Munster may have fallen behind Irish rivals Leinster in the recent roll-call of continental triumph, but they remain the most unwelcoming of hosts. In 19 seasons of the old Heineken Cup they lost just twice in their renowned fortress; against Leicester in 2009 and Ulster three years later. Once again, they showed why they are so effective at home – harnessing the fervent support from the stands to storm the barricades with a pack onslaught and an astute kicking game led by Conor Murray. Yet, for all their command of territory and possession, Munster couldn’t assume control on the scoreboard as Ian Keatley had a mixed night in front of goal. It was 3-3 at the break and that was still the scoreline when Gill’s rash intervention turned the match Munster’s way. A scuffle breaks out during the hot-blooded match between Munster and Saracens on Friday night . They soon had another penalty to their name and despite a seemingly legitimate try by Andrew Conway being ruled out, Dave Kilcoyne was driven over seconds later. Keatley capitalised on another powerful assault to knock over a drop goal and the game was up. Saracens had fought the good fight – with Scotland lock Jim Hamilton the epitome of ferocious defiance – but they couldn’t build on last week’s win over Clermont Auvergne by claiming another prized scalp. McCall was disappointed by the result but said: ‘I’m proud of the effort from the players. We wanted to come away from this game with something and we weren’t overwhelmed by the occasion but we made too many errors – that was the story of our night. But we have five points from our first two games and this pool is wide open.’ Jim Hamilton of Saracens suffered a swollen and bloody eye injury during the defeat for his troubles .","Rhys Gill yellow card costs Saracens as they lose 14-3 against Munster .

"Tottenham's topsy-turvy start to the Premier League campaign continued as the north London outfit suffered a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Alan Pardew's Newcastle. Mauricio Pochettino's side have now won just three of their opening nine Premier League games after suffering their fourth loss of the season. Here, Sportsmail's Craig Hope gives his verdict on how the players performed at White Hart Lane. Tottenham (4-1-4-1) Hugo Lloris 5.5 . Barely had a save to make but picked the ball out of his net twice and that made the difference. Hugo Lloris was unable to stop his side from conceding two goals against Alan Pardew's Newcastle . Eric Dier 5.5 . Strong and willing to get forward but both United goals came from his flank. Jan Vertonghen 6 . Cruised through the afternoon but still ended up on the losing side. Younes Kaboul 6 . Like Vertonghen had little to do but they failed to prevent either concession and for that they must be culpable. Danny Rose 5.5 . A frustrating 90 minutes for the full-back and very little came off for him on an attacking front. Tottenham full back Danny Rose struggled to get into Sunday's match at White Hart Lane . Etienne Capoue (off 67) 5 . Strolled through the game without making any impact. Erik Lamela (off 78) 6 . Showed flashes but never once threatened Krul and was thwarted at every avenue. Ryan Mason 6.5 . Laid on the cross for opening goal and was bright throughout, linking play and making himself available. Tottenham's Ryan Mason claimed the assist for Emmanuel Adebayor's opener . Christian Eriksen 6 . Never hid but did little with the ball either. A disappointing afternoon on the whole. Nacer Chadli 5 . A real surprise to see him last the full game. Did very little. Emmanuel Adebayor (off 83) 6 . Took his goal well and there were signs of improvement, but he faded after the break. Adebayor scored Tottenham's only goal of the match in the 18th minute . Subs . Harry Kane (on 67) 6 . Looked the best bet for an equaliser late on and one cross-cum-shot flashed across goal. Aaron Lennon (on 78) Roberto Soldado (on 83) Newcastle (4-2-3-1) Tim Krul 6.5 . Could do little about Spurs goal and undertook rest of his duties with minimum fuss. Daryl Janmaat 6.5 . Lamela had a couple of periods where he switched flanks and tried to get the better of Janmaat, but on both occasions he was given short shrift and sent back to the right. Steven Taylor 7 . One under-cooked back-pass caused a first-half scare but he was solid apart. Fabricio Coloccini 6.5 . Recovered from a shaky start and marshalled his backline well. Newcastle captain Fabricio Coloccini battles for the ball against fellow countryman Erik Lamela . Paul Dummett 6 . Up against the in-form Lamela he must be applauded for affording the Argentine little chance to shine. Jack Colback 6.5 . Neat and tidy as ever, without being spectacular, but provided the throughball for Ameobi’s equaliser. Vurnon Anita (off 46) 5 . Struggled to get to grips with Spurs’ midfield and was no surprise to see him sacrificed at the break. Gabriel Obertan (off 46) 5.5 . Little chance to replicate recent form given high, hopeful balls forward and made way at half-time. Gabriel Obertan was handed the chance to impress but failed to make an impact . Moussa Sissoko 7.5 . This was the perfect platform for Sissoko to shine, for it was all about his power and pace rather than lack of panache. Yoan Gouffran 6.5 . Put a shift in and repeatedly cleared corners at the near post. Ayoze Perez (off 79) 7 . It looked a thankless task early on but the full debutant kept going and got a deserved winner with his first since joining the club. Newcastle striker Ayoze Perez scored what turned to be the winning goal against Tottenham . Subs . Sammy Ameobi (on 46) 7 . What an impact! Within eight seconds of the restart he had scored with a super finish and he continued to cause problems. Sammy Ameobi  celebrates scoring his side's first goal with team-mate Remy Cabella of Newcastle United . Remy Cabella (on 46) 6.5 .

"At the time of kick-off, the most popular YouTube clip of Erik Lamela's 'Rabona' goal had amassed a staggering 2.3m views in just three days. It's fair to say highlights of the Argentine's performance in Tottenham's miserable defeat to Newcastle United won't have quite the same viral appeal. Lamela, like the entire Spurs team, was struck down at White Hart Lane by that most unpleasant of afflictions - a Europa League hangover. Erik Lamela finds himself crowded out by Jack Colback (right) and Sami Ameobi as he struggled to make an impact during Tottenham's 2-1 home loss by Newcastle United . Lamela gets the wrong side of Newcastle's Daryl Janmaat during the contest at White Hart Lane . Lamela falls to the ground under pressure from Jack Colback as he tries to make an impact . Three days after enchanting the world with his outrageous goal against Asteras Tripolis, Lamela cut an aloof and ineffective figure as Spurs slumped to defeat. His passing was crisp and accurate in the main but failed to release his team-mates into dangerous positions as Spurs were left stunned by Newcastle's double blast at the start of the second-half. Any hopes of carrying the feel-good factor from Thursday night into this match were quickly forgotten. Lamela started on the right flank but didn't see anything of the ball during the opening stages. Indeed, it was 15 minutes in before he enjoyed a proper feel for it, though an end product was lacking. Lamela is closed down by Newcastle defender and compatriot Fabricio Coloccini . Lamela takes on board some water during the game . Increasingly frustrated, he migrated over to the left and slowly gained a foothold in the game, picking passes in and around the edge of the penalty box. There was even a Zidane-esque pirouette on the half-way line that left two Newcastle players bamboozled but it again led nowhere. Lamela's lack of influence scarcely mattered because Tottenham had the lead, gained when Emmanuel Adebayor headed in Ryan Mason's brilliant cross. Lamela was at the forefront of the celebrations having helped the move along with a pass.. Spurs were in control but Newcastle emerged from half-time a completely different proposition. Lamela and Coloccini tussle for the ball as Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino gets involved . Lamela and Coloccini ended tumbling into Pochettino's technical area . Lamela's heat map from the first half shows most of his touches came deep and wide on the right . Passes: 23 (22 short, 1 long) Passing accuracy: 91.3 per cent . Duels won: 3 . Duels lost: 5 . Recovered possession: 2 . Crosses: 1 . Shots: 0 . Chances created: 1 . Eric Dier had admitted in the build-up to the match that his upbrining in Portgual meant he was unaware that the clocks go back every autumn in Britain. The 20-year-old was certainly behind time when Sami Ameobi steamed past him straight from the kick-off and levelled for Newcastle just six seconds in. And the game was flipped on its head shortly afterwards when Ayoze Perez headed home his first Premier League goal from a Remy Cabella cross. Lamela wasn't at fault for Newcastle's two goals and it overshadowed his brightest period in the match. There were a few step-overs and shoulder-drops but, with Spurs trailing, it was hardly the time for showboating. Lamela tries to get the better of Newcastle's Yoan Gouffran during the White Hart Lane contest . Lamela's heat map by the time he was replaced by Aaron Lennon with 12 minutes remaining . Eventually, Mauricio Pochettino had seen enough and Lamela was hooked off for Aaron Lennon with 12 minutes left. It had been a performance that again raised questions about Lamela's effectiveness in the Premier League. Scoring wonderful goals against Greeks bearing gifts is one thing. To replicate that impact at this higher standard quite another.","Erik Lamela's outrageous 'Rabona' goal on Thursday stunned the world .

A slightly contradictory Arsenal statement read: 'Ozil complained of a sore left knee after the game and the club advised the German FA to run medical checks when he joined up with his international squad. 'The club will make further assessments and it is too early to say how long Ozil may be out of action'. Ozil, signed for £42.5million last year, had drawn criticism for a number of below-par performances in an Arsenal shirt. Nevertheless, the news serves to intensify Arsene Wenger's growing injury trouble just two months into the new season. Aaron Ramsey, Mathieu Debuchy and Olivier Giroud are all long term absentees, while Mikel Arteta is also nursing a knock. Joachim Low (right) and his German team sent Ozil to receive an MRI scan in Munich . The lateral collateral ligament (LCL) goes from the top part of the fibula (the bone on the outside of the lower leg) to the outside part of the lower thigh bone. The ligament helps keep the outer side of the knee joint stable. The LCL is usually injured by pressure or an injury that pushes the knee joint from the inside, which results in stress on the outside part of the joint. Symptoms include swelling, the knee locking or giving way. It means Ozil will miss four crucial Champions League fixtures, along with Premier League clashes against Manchester United and - in all probability - Liverpool. He looks likely to be out of action for 12 domestic games. A statement on the DFB website read: 'The MRI examination today at National Dr Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt in Munich revealed a partial rupture of the outer band of the left knee joint. 'The treatment is conservative, with six weeks of immobilisation of the knee joint. Mesut Ozil is likely to be (out for) 10 to 12 weeks.'","Arsenal dealt huge blow as German misses the rest of 2014 .

Morgan Amalfitano and Diafra Sakho put the home side two goals to the good before David Silva set up a frantic finale with a superb finish into the corner. Here, Sportsmail's Sam Cunningham gives his verdict on how the players performed. West Ham (4-1-2-1-2): . Adrian - 7 . What a save to deny Sergio Aguero in the second half after the striker had wriggled free and another in the opening period when the ball ricocheted off the City man and he reacted quickly. Adrian making one of his many saves, which helped West Ham hold on for an invaluable three points . Carl Jenkinson - 6.5 . Got forward regularly down the right flank and was composed at the back. An all-round solid performance. James Collins - 7 . Sensational block to keep out Aguero's follow-up effort in the second half. A potentially very difficult afternoon well dealt with. Winston Reid - 6.5 . Solid at the back, but not always on top of Aguero and Silva, who broke through in patches, particularly in the second half. Aaron Cresswell - 7.5 . Another consummate display from the full-back, who is taking to life at West Ham well. Great cross to set up the second. Alex Song impressed for West Ham, and was their star man against Manchester City . Song, with James Collins (right), take the applause of the West Ham faithful after the match . Alex Song - 8 . Yet another commanding display from the centre of the park. His through ball to play in Enner Valencia to set up West Ham's first could not have been better weighted. Immense. Mark Noble - 7 . Tireless running and tackling all game. He just does not stop haring around the pitch. A real asset to his team. Morgan Amalfitano - 7 . Left with a tap-in for West Ham's opener and made life difficult for City's defence with his runs from midfield. Morgan Amalfitano scored to put West Ham 1-0 up at Upton Park on Saturday afternoon . Amalfitano scored his second goal of the season - his first was against Liverpool at Upton Park . Stewart Downing - 5.5 . Sent a free header over the bar in the first half which would've put them two goals ahead. Enner Valencia - 7 . His run to set up the first was immense – such a burst of pace it took him flying into the home fans. Diafra Sakho - 7.5 . Strong and powerful up front, he ran Manchester City's back line ragged all afternoon – winning headers and holding up the ball. A constant threat. Manager: Sam Allardyce - 8.5 . Diafra Sakho scored to double West Ham's lead with 15 minutes to go in the match . Manchester City (4-4-2): . Joe Hart - 7 . Had a busier afternoon than he was possibly expecting. The save from Valencia at point-blank range was brave and crucial – and required treatment when he took a knock afterwards. Pablo Zabaleta - 5 . Tried his best on City's right flank to get forward and support the attack, but it occasionally left them vulnerable on the break. Vincent Kompany - 4.5 . Struggled to deal with the pace and power of Valencia and Sakho, but his afternoon was made more difficult alongside Eliaquim Mangala. Eliaquim Mangala - 3 . Shocking performance from the £32million man. Mis-hit clearances, being tackled by opposition forwards and always looking vulnerable. Eliaquim Mangala (left) struggled to deal with West Ham's forwards - he is pictured losing out to Carlton Cole . Gael Clichy - 5 . Not a glistening performance, by any stretch of the imagination, and looked tired on the left. Jesus Navas - 5Not his best performance in a Manchester City shirt. Usually threatens opposition players with his speed but never got going. Fernando - 5 . Drove City forward at times and had his work cut-out with Yaya Toure putting in another less-than-convincing effort. Yaya Toure - 5.5 . Two glorious chances to score, both in the second half. The first, Adrian somehow kept out with a diving save, the second he curled on to the bar. David Silva - 7 . Combined well with Aguero for City's most dangerous attacks. Sensational solo goal to shimmy past two and bend in an effort. David Silva scored to reduce West Ham's lead, but Man City could not find an equaliser . Sergio Aguero was disappointing and should have been sent off in the first half . Replays of Aguero's tackle shows that he should have been sent off for a two-footed lunge on Mark Noble . Sergio Aguero - 5.5 . Bright and looked sharp on the ball, getting away a few long-range efforts, but West Ham did well to nullify his threat. Still should've scored on three occasions. Edin Dzeko - 5 . A very quiet afternoon for the striker, who needs to start scoring to warrant a place in City's starting line-up. Manager: Manuel Pellegrini - 5 .","Morgan Amalfitano opened the scoring for West Ham at Upton Park .
On-form Diafra Sakho doubled the lead with 15 minutes to play .

"Arsene Wenger does not believe there is a problem with the intensity of Arsenal's training after Per Mertesacker suggested they need to work harder. Mertesacker made his comments in the wake of the Gunners' fortunate 2-1 Champions League win in Anderlecht, in which they required two goals in the final minutes to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. That result came on the back of another disappointing home draw against Hull last Saturday. Wenger said: 'I don't know what he meant by that. But you have to be careful with statements after the game. I think we train very hard, the attitude is right and the spirit is there.' VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsene Wenger respond to Per Mertesacker's comments . Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker (centre) in training at London Colney this week . Arsenal laboured once again during their clash at Anderlecht on Wednesday night . 'Until now we have been relatively consistent in our attitude but not efficient enough offensively or defensively. 'We lost only two games (in all competitions) but we have not made enough points.' Mertesacker had offered stinging criticism of both Arsenal's style of training and style of play following yet another poor performance in Belgium. The north London outfit are already 11 points off Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League title race after drawing five of their opening eight matches. 'We are not at our best,' the Arsenal vice-captain said. 'Football-wise we lack a few things. We have to be honest to ourselves and train harder. 'Everyone knows that it is a difficult start to the season for us and confidence is not how we want it. Lukas Podolski (left, with Mertesacker) rescued a Champions League victory with a last-minute winner . But Arsenal are well off the title pace set by Chelsea after drawing against Hull last Saturday . 'I think we have to do better with our own possession, to put more pressure on them [opponents], not to lose so many balls in the middle of the park, to play more in wide areas. 'I think it is better to expose them there, instead of playing one-twos through the middle. It doesn't work as much as last season, so we have to work on that. The passing game is not as efficient as last year. But all of a sudden we lose players week-by-week.' Wenger indicated Theo Walcott will not be ready to play this weekend against Sunderland after a nine-month lay off with a serious knee injury. Theo Walcott is back in training with Arsenal but is not yet quite ready for a return to the first team . He said: 'He has to get used to contact again. He has been out nine months, he needs to get used to being kicked again. He needs to feel completely confident but he is not far. Fitness wise he is there. Contact front he needs a bit more time.' Arsenal travel to the Stadium of Light hoping to take advantage of a team still in shock from the 8-0 hammering they received at Southampton last week. But Wenger warned his men to expect a fightback from Gus Poyet's side. 'We expect commitment and fight for 90 minutes and we have to prepare for that,' he said. 'The result will have dropped their confidence and increased their resolve.'","Arsenal face Sunderland on Saturday 3pm at the Stadium of Light .

"Michael Carrick says he still hopes to be involved in Manchester United’s clash with Chelsea on Sunday after playing just over an hour for the Red Devils’ Under 21s against West Ham. Carrick barely broke into a sweat as he sat in front of a back four, reading the game with trademark intelligence as he coasted through their 2-1 win. He returned to the bench for United’s 2-2 draw at West Brom on Monday but manager Louis van Gaal seemed to have ruled him out of Sunday’s game, claiming the midfielder needs more minutes under his belt as he returns from an ankle injury. Manchester United star Michael Carrick got 64 minutes under his belt against his former side . Carrick warmed up with his Manchester United team-mates before taking part in the Under 21 match . Carrick was joined by fellow senior star Anders Lindegaard in United's starting line-up to play West Ham . Red Devils star Carrick was an unused substitute against West Brom on Monday night . West Ham U21s: Howes, Westley, Page, Makasi, Onariase, Pask, Bywater, Nasha, Lee, Lletget, Gordan. Subs: Knoyle, Boness, Fanimo, Mavila. Manchester United U21s: Lindegaard, Vermijl, Thorpe, Blackett, James, Janko, Carrick, A.Pereira, Weir, Wilson, W.Keane. Subs: O'Hara, Grimshaw, Love, Goss, A.Fletcher. But Carrick insists his appearance at West Ham’s academy ground on Friday night does not mean he is ruled out of contention on Sunday and the England midfielder says he still hopes to play a part against the league leaders at Old Trafford. Carrick, speaking exclusively to Sportsmail, said: 'I'm realistic, I've got to be patient. I've been out for five and a half months so I've got to understand the bigger picture. I'm not saying I won't be involved on Sunday, hopefully I can be in some way. 'I don't know yet though, I'll just have to wait and see. I'm just being patient really, I've got to understand the situation. 'It's been a long time. I've been injured for three months but I've been out for five and a half months since my last game so to get back was a big step really.' The 33-year-old has not played a competitive game since United’s 1-1 draw at Southampton on the final day of last season and underwent ankle surgery in July – on the day Van Gaal was unveiled by the club. He has since spent three months on the sidelines as United have struggled to put last season’s travails behind them, picking up just three wins from their opening eight league games along with an embarrassing exit from the Capital One Cup after a 4-0 drubbing at the hands of MK Dons. Van Gaal has toyed with different systems but struggled to find a player to protect his defence, despite the best efforts of new signing Daley Blind, and is keen to get Carrick back into the fold. Carrick whispers to Manchester United team-mate James Wilson during a set piece routine . Carrick played 64 minutes against a West Ham academy team – where he started his professional career – and sat in front of a back four, rarely pushing himself into an attacking area as he looked to dictate the play and provide United’s young attackers with some forward thrust. United won the game after James Wilson’s fine opener had been levelled by West Ham’s Elliot Lee, before Will Keane grabbed a 78th-minute winner, 14 minutes after Carrick had been replaced. His inclusion in the match, under 48 hours before the Sunday’s game, as well as Van Gaal’s pre-match comments, seem to suggest the midfielder is unlikely to play, despite his desire to get back to Premier League business. Van Gaal had said: 'I'm sorry to say no other players are back, even if I let Carrick play in London for reserves because he needs to play matches when you are five months injured. He told me it was his first game for the reserves.' But Carrick was still pleased to get some game time at the Hammers’ Rush Green academy ground, 10 years after leaving the club for Tottenham in a £3.5million deal. 'They started using [Rush Green Stadium] just as I was leaving,' he added. 'The last time I was here was to watch my brother [Graeme] play. He was at West Ham just as I had left really. But it's nice to be back and see a few old faces.' Senior star Carrick talks tactics with Manchester United's Saidy Janko during the match at Rush Green .

"Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas believes there is something more 'satisfying' than scoring a goal on a football pitch - providing for one. The former Arsenal and Barcelona star has revealed he has always felt more satisfaction having assisted a strike for one of his team-mates than he has when finding the back of the net himself. Spain international Fabregas has enjoyed a wonderful start to life at Chelsea and he will head to Old Trafford with the rest of the Blues squad to take on Manchester United in a key clash on Sunday. Cesc Fabregas (left) has admitted he prefers to assist goals for his team-mates than score them himself . Fabregas appears to have quickly won over the Chelsea fans despite having played for rivals Arsenal before . Fabregas (centre) scored the decisive goal against Crystal Palace following a beautiful move in second half . Fabregas was speaking to Champions, the official magazine of the UEFA Champions League . Fabregas, speaking to Champions, the official magazine of the UEFA Champions League, said: 'Whenever they asked me in interviews if I preferred scoring or providing an assist, I would always say an assist. 'There is nothing quite like scoring a goal. Scoring goals is the most beautiful part of football, but I have always identified myself with and enjoyed providing the final ball. 'Only the people who know how to play the final pass for a goal know what it feels like, and I feel immense joy when a goal is scored from my pass. 'Putting the striker through one-on-one with the keeper is enormously satisfying.' Life at Stamford Bridge appears bright right now for Fabregas, who has scored twice and assisted nine goals in his 11 Premier League and Champions League appearances so far. He has forged a wonderful relationship with striker Diego Costa, with the pair helping Chelsea to the top of the table. But the 27-year-old has admitted it took him a little time to adjust to Blues boss Jose Mourinho's methods - although now he has fully embraced the Portuguese's philosophy and is ready to prosper at the Bridge. He continued: 'At the start I found it tough in training with a coach like Mourinho, who is a bit more imposing. 'Be well-positioned. Drop off. Support the players behind you, do not lose the ball”. (But now) I really like it.' Fabregas (left) and Diego Costa have been two factors in Chelsea's outstanding early season form .

"Angel di Maria is fit for Manchester United's crunch match against Chelsea on Sunday. The £60million signing was struggling with a thigh injury picked up in their 2-2 draw at West Bromwich Albion on Monday and it was feared that he would miss their biggest game of the season so far. He had an ice-pack on the injury after being substituted in the 76th minute, but was able to train for the past two days and is ready for Chelsea.

Van Gaal also revealed that Michael Carrick will play in a development game against West Ham in London on Friday night in a bid to regain match fitness. The midfielder was a surprise inclusion on United's bench against West Brom on Monday night, but did not make it on the field. Van Gaal added: 'I even let Michael Carrick this evening play in London against West Ham in the reserve team. 'I believe he needs that, he needs to play matches especially when you are five months injured. He said that it was his first experience in the second team.' The United boss will be without the suspended Wayne Rooney but Radamel Falcao, who scored a hat-trick the last time he faced Chelsea in Atletico Madrid's Super Cup triumph last year, is available. Chelsea's star striker Diego Costa has a 'chance' of playing at Old Trafford on Sunday, according to Jose Mourinho, despite the Spain striker missing the last two matches with a hamstring problem and being admitted to hospital this week with a virus. Mourinho said: 'There is a chance, he has a little chance. Diego has a little chance, the same as Ramires and (John Obi) Mikel. 'Everything happened (to Costa). He was obviously injured - that was hamstring. He had to go to hospital with a viral situation that we didn't manage to resolve without being in hospital over one night - that was before Maribor. 'Against Maribor he wouldn't have been ready from the injury, no chance. But being ill didn't help the recovery process because we didn't have him at Cobham (training ground).

"Danny Shittu marked his first league start in more than seven months with the winning goal as Millwall sank Cardiff 1-0 at The Den. The Nigerian defender had just one Capital One Cup appearance to his name this season having been sidelined since March with an Achilles injury. But he powered home a second-half header to end Millwall's eight-game winless run and also halt Cardiff's winning start under new manager Russell Slade. Millwall's Danny Shittu rises above the rest to head his team in front against Cardiff on Saturday afternoon . Shittu celebrates his goal with his Millwall team-mates in Championship clash at The Den . Ian Holloway's men had failed to win any of their previous eight games before the victory against Cardiff . However Slade will be wondering how his City side, who are still winless on the road this season, did not take the lead late in the first half. Instead Millwall were indebted to a stunning double save from former Bluebirds goalkeeper David Forde to deny Craig Noone and then, from close range, Adam Le Fondre. Neither Forde nor opposite number David Marshall had been called into action for the majority of the half due to some wayward finishing from both sides. Shaun Williams fired wide and Lee Gregory headed over for Millwall while John Brayford and Le Fondre sent presentable opportunities over the crossbar for the visitors. Millwall's Ricardo Fuller tussles with John Brayford of Cardiff in a deserved win for the home side . Matthew Briggs (centre) dribbles through Cardiff City's Anthony Pilkington and Federico Macheda . But 10 minutes before the interval a slip in the Millwall defence saw the ball break to Noone on the left-hand side of the area. The winger drove in a volley which Forde got down well to block, but only as far as Le Fondre who had what appeared a simple task to tap the ball into an empty net from all of six yards out. However, Forde managed to spring back up and spread himself to deny the striker with his legs in spectacular fashion. That save proved all the more vital nine minutes into the second half when Shittu, named captain on his return to the starting line-up, made the breakthrough. Bruno Ecuele Managa (left) is put under pressure by Millwall striker Lee Gregory near the Cardiff area . Shittu had just one Capital One Cup appearance to his name this season having been sidelined since March . Shaun Williams whipped in a corner from the right and Shittu rose above Bruno Manga and Federico Macheda at the far post to thump a downward header through a crowd of players and into the net. Millwall could have added to their lead but Gregory lobbed over the crossbar when clean through and then missed the rebound after Scott McDonald's shot was parried, while Ed Upson drove wide from 15 yards. Cardiff had a late penalty shout for handball against Shittu, after a mazy run from sub Ravel Morrison, waved away as the Lions held out for a much-needed win.","Danny Shittu scores for Millwall after his goal just before the hour mark .

"Rene Meulensteen has warned his former club Manchester United they cannot afford to underestimate Chelsea even if  Diego Costa is not fit enough to play in Sunday's clash at Old Trafford. The Spain striker has made a superb start to life at Stamford Bridge and has scored nine goals in seven Premier League appearances despite suffering from an ongoing hamstring problem, which ruled him out of the Blues' last two matches.

"Louis van Gaal insists he will never be swayed by Jose Mourinho’s mind games because he has an ‘iron shield’ surrounding him. Chelsea manager Mourinho is renowned for making jibes at his opponents in a bid to ruffle their feathers. He has replaced Sir Alex Ferguson as the master of mind games in the Premier League but may have met his match in former mentor Van Gaal, who he faces at Old Trafford on Sunday. VIDEO Scroll down as Louis van Gaal says Jose Mourinho is a modest and emotional man . Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal (pictured) says Jose Mourinho's mind games won't work on him . Chelsea manager Mourinho is renowned for making jibes at his opponents in a bid to ruffle their feathers . ‘I’m made from a little bit of iron so I have a shield, an iron shield,’ said the Manchester United boss, lowering his right hand in front of his face to represent a barrier. Can anything get past it? ‘No,’ said Van Gaal, who was known in Holland as the ‘Iron Tulip’. He added: ‘Because I think everybody can write or speak about me — I cannot change that — I have learnt not to react and believe in myself, my players, my staff and that is important.’ Where Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger and Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini have reacted to Mourinho’s comments over recent seasons, Van Gaal was calm ahead of United’s match against the league leaders on Sunday. The Dutchman joked that he had only learned to shield himself from comments since coming to England three months ago. He was perhaps buoyed by Angel di Maria being ruled fit after recovering from a thigh injury picked up against West Bromwich Albion. Mourinho may have his own injury boost because he revealed he is ready to risk top-scorer Diego Costa, who has missed Chelsea’s last two games with a hamstring problem and spent time in hospital this week after contracting a virus.

Mourinho may have his own injury boost because he revealed he is ready to risk top-scorer Diego Costa . In terms of mind games, reputations have counted for little for Mourinho, who has targeted Wenger, Pellegrini and Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola. But Van Gaal knows Mourinho better than most, having made him one of his assistants and most trusted coaches when he was in charge at Barcelona from 1997 to 2000. Mourinho used Barcelona, where he was first a translator under Sir Bobby Robson and became his close confidant, as a launch-pad to success. Van Gaal and Mourinho have remained close, although the pair have not met since he took over at United. Mourinho, then-Inter Milan manager, greets Van Gaal, who was boss of Bayern Munich at the time .

Their first was when Mourinho masterminded Inter Milan’s 2-0 Champions League final win against a Bayern Munich side led by Van Gaal in 2010. The United boss has said Mourinho is a better coach than him now, and on Friday admitted his surprise that his counterpart has gone on to achieve so much. He believes Mourinho now poses the biggest challenge he has faced as a manager but is not fazed by it. Van Gaal added: ‘You have to analyse that I have started just three months ago and him longer.

"After the celebration comes the hangover — or at least a sober analysis of Arsenal’s standing in Europe. Having chosen Arsene Wenger’s 65th birthday to stage one of the most dramatic and unlikely comebacks in the manager’s 18 years at the club, his team might have been tempted to raise a glass to their fortitude and spirit as they flew back from Brussels on Wednesday night. However, the euphoria of such an astonishing turnaround against Anderlecht, with goals from Kieran Gibbs and Lukas Podolski in the last two minutes keeping them on course for the knockout stages, could not mask the previous 88 which had exposed their European pretensions. Lukas Podolski's last-gasp goal snatched the points for Arsenal at Anderlecht on Wednesday night . Per Mertesacker congratulates Podolski after Arsenal came from behind to earn victory . And at least Per Mertesacker, captain for the evening, was not in the mood to soft-pedal his analysis of the performance. Sunderland on Saturday may be licking their wounds from an 8-0 defeat at Southampton, but Arsenal are hardly firing on all cylinders. ‘The last five minutes were great,’ said the German World Cup winner. ‘For 85 minutes we lacked a bit of everything. We are just pleased with the last five minutes and our finishing. Everyone knows that it is a difficult start to the season for us, and confidence is not how we want it. Mertesacker admits Arsenal were off the pace against their Belgian opponents . Arsenal players celebrate at the final whistle after sealing an unlikely win away in Europe . 'The character is good and the mentality is good. But football-wise we lack a few things. The passing game is not as efficient as last year. We are not at our best. We have to be honest with ourselves and train harder. ‘We have to do better with our own possession, to put more pressure on the opposition, not to lose so many balls in the middle of the park, to play more in wide areas. 'It is better to expose them there, instead of playing one-twos through the middle. It doesn’t work as much as last season, so we have to work on that.’ Podolski's late intervention saved manager Arsene Wenger's blushes . Kieran Gibbs started the Arsenal late show when he hauled the visitors level . What can be said is that Arsenal are forging an indomitable spirit. They don’t lose much now and late comebacks are becoming a trait. Goals in the 90th minute have secured wins against Crystal Palace and Anderlecht and draws against Everton and Hull. But prior to the late intervention of Gibbs and Podolski, Arsenal were being given the runaround. Their lack of defensive cover and the frequent inability of the midfield to impose itself are well recorded. Up front, Alexis Sanchez looked a threat but Danny Welbeck faded. Thankfully for Arsenal, Podolski made the most of a rare outing. Mertesacker said: ‘He is in a difficult period but he showed how vital he is. You can wake him up any second in the day and he will score with his left foot. That is a quality we need.’","Gunners came from behind to snatch 2-1 victory in the Champions League .

Hearn responded: 'Correct, you wouldn't last three rounds. Time will tell, concentrate on your fight; hope it happens for you. 'Give me a call after your scheduled fight.' Joshua has knocked out each of his opponents to date and takes on Michael Sprott in Liverpool on November 22.

"Blackpool boss Jose Riga has put pressure on chairman Karl Oyston to strike a deal for Belgian midfielder Jonathan Legear. The 27-year-old, who has two caps, has spent the last two weeks training with the struggling Championship side in an effort to earn a permanent contract. He is a free agent after leaving KV Mechelen.

"Blackpool owner Owen Oyston has insisted that his family are not using the club as a cash cow and are not in the process of asset stripping the Seasiders. Oyston - alongside son Karl, who is chairman - has presided over the worst year in the club’s recent history. There have been major disputes with Jose Riga over transfer policy and the new manager could have lost his job on a number of occasions since taking over before pre-season. Riga was dealt a bucketload of trialists before the Championship campaign kicked off and only landed one of his original targets, Costa Rican midfielder Jose Cubero. Owen Oyston has insisted that his family are not using Blackpool as a cash cow . Jose Riga has had little to work with since taking over at the club in the summer . Major criticism has been levelled at the Oystons for perceived greed. But Owen, now 80, refutes the claims. ‘It’s simply not true we have asset stripped or misappropriated football generated funds,’ he told the Blackpool Gazette. ‘If those responsible for these allegations had examined the accounts of the football group they would have seen we had been building up substantial assets to strengthen and secure the football club over 27 years, protecting the club from debt and producing revenue income and more recently substantial profits for the football group. ‘We are one of the few clubs in the football world that have no debts and are in profit.’ The reason they have no debts, of course, is the overt unwillingness to compete on a financial level with the rest of the second tier in the transfer market. The £300,000 spent on Cubero - a small fee in football’s wider spectrum - is one of only two occasions they have sanctioned the purchase of a player in the last two years. Jose Cubero was the only player Blackpool spent money on this season . The Blackpool fans are planning a mass protest ahead of the Cardiff game this Friday night . The timing of Oyston’s interview - he rarely speaks - won’t be lost on supporters, who plan mass protests against the regime during the home game against Cardiff on Friday night. This will only add fuel to an ever-expanding fire, made all the more fierce by chronic results on the pitch. Riga’s side lie at the foot of the table and are staring relegation in the face. Oyston, however, still bizarrely believes they can make the play-offs. The club still train at the shambolic base at Squires Gate - largely unchanged since the 1950s. It was labelled a ‘hell hole’ by Ian Holloway five years ago and remains the same today. To sum up the lack of pride, a sign reading: ‘Blackpool Football Club Centre of Excellance (sic)’ has not been removed, remaining at front of house for years. While supporters have always accepted the Oystons run the club differently to the rest of the Football League, the alarming figures released through the family’s various accounts have created a swell of ill-feeling. Oyston still believes the club can reach the play-offs despite failing to register a win this season . The Oystons transferred £26m into companies they owned since Blackpool’s unexpected promotion  in 2010 . It was revealed that the Oystons transferred £26million into companies they owned since Blackpool’s unexpected promotion to the Premier League in 2010. That included an £11m payment to Owen himself. Club president Valeri Belokon paid for the erection of the latest stand to be built, named after Jimmy Armfield. But Oyston continued: ‘Blackpool FC Ltd couldn’t have financed the stands and paid to finish them off. That money went to Segesta (the name of Blackpool’s parent company, including properties) and was then used through various other companies to carry out the work. We had to have separate construction companies to do it. ‘Part was also used to repay loans made to the football group by Oyston Group companies interest free at a time when no-one else would lend money to the football group and without which they could not have continued.’","Owen Oyston has insisted  family are not using the club as a cash cow .

"Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini is confident England goalkeeper Joe Hart will sign a new contract at the Etihad Stadium. Hart has been back to his best this season and the club have been in negotiations over a new deal. The 27-year-old's current contract expires in the summer of 2016. Joe Hart has been in very good form this season and is expected to sign a new contract at Manchester City . City boss Manuel Pellegrini is confident that Hart is happy at City and will extend his stay at the Etihad . Pellegrini said: 'I think it's an issue that we're talking about. Joe knows what I think about that. I think in the right moment, (we will) have the right solution. I think Joe wants to stay here and we want him to stay.' If he re-signs, Hart would follow team-mates Samir Nasri, Aleksandar Kolarov, David Silva, Vincent Kompany, Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko, who all agreed fresh terms in the summer. Pellegrini dropped Hart for a spell last autumn after a series of high-profile errors. He responded well and finished the season strongly, helping City win the  Premier League and Capital One cup after regaining his place. This season some of his performances have been top-drawer. He was outstanding in a Champions League loss at Bayern Munich last month and was similarly impressive in last Saturday's 4-1 thrashing of Tottenham. Hart makes a save in Tuesday's disappointing 2-2 draw against CSKA Moscow in the Champions League . Extra motivation might have come from the summer signing of Willy Caballero from Pellegrini's former club Malaga, but the manager puts the improvement down to Hart himself. Pellegrini said: 'He is not responding to the challenge of Willy. He is responding as number one goalkeeper as England. Except for the first three months of last year, Joe Hart always puts in a very good performance.' Despite Hart's brilliance, City's defence has not been impregnable this season and they have kept just two clean sheets out of eight in the Premier League. Manchester City manager Pellegrini was left frustarted by his side's 2-2 draw against CSKA Moscow . Pellegrini acknowledges that but does not see it is an area needing specific attention and instead wants general improvement across the pitch. The Chilean said: 'We are always trying to improve in all senses, in attack and in defence. 'This season we are not so strong in attacking. Last season in the first eight games I think we had scored more goals than now. Willy Caballero was brought in  to challenge Hart for the goalkeeping position but Hart has responded well . 'But also we had conceded more goals than now. This season our defence is (joint) second behind Southampton as the best in the league. 'By our defence I'm not talking about only the back line, I'm talking the whole team, and I think we're defending well. But of course we must improve. There's a lot of goals that we can avoid and it will be better for us.'","Joe Hart's current contract expires in the summer of 2016 .

"The bizarre running of Blackpool plunged to new depths on Tuesday night as Burton Albion manager Gary Rowett rejected the club’s advances - despite there being no official vacancy. Chairman Karl Oyston is primed to sack Jose Riga after just three months in charge and had identified Owen Coyle as the perfect successor. The former Wigan boss turned down the opportunity after disagreements over a five-figure agent fee, meaning the Seasiders turned to Rowett. VIDEO Scroll down to see Barry Ferguson's interview after taking over from  Paul Ince . Staying put: Burton boss Gary Rowett has rejected the chance to speak to Blackpool . Snub: Burton confirmed Blackpool's unsuccessful approach via their official Twitter account . The Burton manager is highly regarded in the game for his exuberant brand of football and has impressed on a tight budget - something that would appeal to Oyston. Riga had looked like being sacked over the weekend but took training on Monday and Tuesday before talks with Oyston. The club are ready to dispense with his services as soon as they manage to find a man willing to work for the club. Rowett wasn't prepared to do so, with Burton confirming the news on their Twitter account. 'Following discussions with Blackpool, I have decided that I will remain at Burton Albion for the foreseeable future,' he told the club's website. 'I feel as though it is not the right job for me at the present time. 'We’ve made an excellent start to this season, winning seven out of eight games and I feel we have an excellent group of players in the squad currently. I enjoy working with them immensely and this is a very exciting time to be involved at Burton Albion.' Heading for the exit: Jose Riga's turbulent Bloomfield Road tenure is set to be ended . Blackpool heralded a new era at Bloomfield Road as Riga jetted in, labelling it the ‘Riga Revolution’. That, however, hasn’t been allowed to happen after sustained bickering and fallouts between the Belgian and Oyston. The pair never saw eye-to-eye from day one, Riga crying broken promises and Oyston questioning his manager’s motives at every turn. It meant Blackpool - who were in the top half of the Premier League this time four years ago - lost their opening six competitive fixtures of the season and barely have a squad to show for a summer of laughable recruitment. Riga was forced to train with fewer than 11 players for the majority of pre-season and failed to land most of his top targets. Oyston didn’t agree with some of the fees banded about for foreign imports. Man at the top: Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston is poised to wield the axe . The situation has since escalated - Oyston using his column in the town’s local newspaper to attack his own manager - and it appeared Riga would be sacked over the weekend. The chairman said he was left ‘bemused’ at the Belgian’s decision to take a week’s holiday back home over the international break, claiming he didn’t inform anybody at the club. Oyston had in fact set the wheels in motion for Riga’s sacking weeks ago but now faces trying to find a new man quickly or promote from within - former England Under 19s coach Noel Blake being the likely beneficiary.","Brewers chief rejects Seasiders - despite there being no official vacancy .

'Victor has accepted my apology and we move on. I will endeavour to choose my words more carefully in the future. My stance on players diving remains the same, but understand it's part of the game.' Moses is keen to put the matter behind him after speaking to Hartson. 'I'm grateful to John for having taken the trouble to ring me to apologise for his comments,' he said. 'I'm happy to accept his apology and am now keen to move on.' Coates accused former Wales international Hartson of bias punditry. 'For John Hartson and Garry Monk to call Moses a cheat is disgraceful,' said Coates. 'He didn't cheat, he's not a cheat and we firmly believe those comments crossed the line. 'I thought Mark Hughes dealt with the matter well after the game but when Hartson made his comments on the Sunday night we couldn't let it go. Moses won a penalty late in the first half for Charlie Adam to draw The Potters level against Swansea .

"Luis Suarez became frustrated at being asked questions about his World Cup bite scandal that he walked out of an interview... with the newspaper serialising his new autobiography. The former Liverpool striker, who will make his Barcelona debut in Saturday evening’s El Clasico, was banned for three months for biting Italy’s Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup in Brazil. The Uruguayan cut short the interview with The Guardian after he claimed he was asked ‘38,000 times’ about the incident. Luis Suarez stormed out of an interview with the Guardian after being asked about his bite on Giorgio Chiellini .

Suarez exited off the pitch he was being interviewed on with his agent, saying: ‘They asked me about the bite 38,000 times, never again. ‘This is the last one of these [interviews], I feel like taking off my microphone.’ The interview ended there, but all eyes will be on Suarez once again in Saturday’s clash at the Bernabeu. About the Evra incident, Suarez had said: ‘I know I was wrong with the biting and the diving but I was accused of racism without any proof,’ Suarez said. ‘There were lots of cameras, but no evidence.

"Sergio Aguero has given an insight into the crazy world of Mario Balotelli by revealing what it was like playing with the controversial forward at Manchester City between 2011 and 2013. In his new book, Born To Rise: My Story, which has been serialised in the Mirror, Aguero explains that there was never a dull moment playing alongside the maverick Italian, especially as the now Liverpool striker had little or no regard for authority.

"Tottenham fans should get down to White Hart Lane on a Thursday night. They should make an atmosphere, make it unplayable for the visitors and replicate the feel of those Champions League nights. Why? Because by far their best chance of reliving them - those wins over Young Boys, Inter Milan, FC Twente and Werder Bremen - is winning the Europa League. Every Europa League game from here on in is more important than the Premier League. Tottenham thrashed Asteras Tripolis in the Europa League but White Hart Lane was far from full . Managers will never admit to prioritising a cup over the league; some are bold enough to admit vice versa. But for Mauricio Pochettino, their best chance of reaching the Champions League is by lifting the Europa League in Warsaw in May. With Spurs’ quality individuals and strength in depth, the competition is winnable.

That’s six players with 197 international caps. White Hart Lane was only 60 per cent full for the visit of Asteras Tripolis, but for £25 an adult, £5 a junior and a superb £50 family deal for four tickets, those who stayed at home missed out on value for money. First, there was Erik Lamela’s ludicrous goal, surely the most skilful and audacious finish seen in this part of north London for years. Erik Lamela scored a brilliant goal for Tottenham with a perfectly-executed 'rabona' Lamela watches as his shot heads for the net as Tottenham cruised to victory . Lamela showed glimpses of his ability but the youngster has yet to display it week in, week out . Then youngster Kane, proving once again he is a huge prospect (not between the sticks) with a striker’s hat-trick. Lamela’s blistering second and Hugo Lloris’ world class save, before being sent off, completed a night of superlatives. Spurs fans were truly entertained for only the second time this season against the team who had previously topped the group, and qualification to the knockout stages should follow for Pochettino. Their league form is less to shout about. Inconsistency has plagued Spurs in recent years, but the Europa League is a maximum 17-game tournament that essentially bypasses the rigours of the Premier League. Harry Kane scored a hat-trick to keep up his impressive form in Europe this season . But the youngster fumbled a free kick into his own net after replacing Hugo Lloris who was sent off . Of course, winning it is no simple task. Three of the last six winners had been filtered out from the Champions League group stages, and that is a road block still to come for those gaining confidence in the pre-knockout rounds.

"What a night to remember for Tottenham's Harry Kane in their resounding Group C Europa League victory against Asteras Tripolis on Thursday night. The striker scored a hat-trick as Mauricio Pochettino's side recorded their first win in the competition with a thumping 5-1 triumph at White Hart Lane. The 21-year-old endeared himself to the Spurs faithful even further when he volunteered himself to go in goal following Hugo Lloris' dismissal in the closing stages of the match. Harry Kane ended up in goal after Hugo Lloris was sent off and conceded a late free-kick . Kane had an eventful evening as Tottenham thrashed Asteras Tripolis 5-1 in their Europa League match . With the hosts having made all their substitutes, Kane was soon left to rue that decision as he let Jeronimo Barrales' tame free-kick slip under his grasp and trickle into the bottom corner of the goal. Any regular goalkeeper would have expected to make a routine save, but despite Kane's comical error he was ironically cheered by the Tottenham faithful who had witnessed a performance of promise from the England Under 21 star. 'It was a great night until I went in goal,' he told ITV4 in his post-match interview afterwards. 'In fairness I think I'll leave that to the keepers from now on [on his error to concede Asteras' consolation goal]. It was a great result for us, a great win, and obviously I'm happy to get the hat-trick.' Kane (left) gave Tottenham the lead with a blistering strike in the first half at White Hart Lane . Kane (centre) doubled his goal tally for the night tapping home from close range in the 75th minute . Kane (right) completed his first hat-trick for the club, heading home late on to make the scoreline 5-0 to Spurs . Kane's magic night began in the 13th minute when he unleashed a blistering right-footed drive from 25-yards out that nestled into the bottom right-hand corner of  Tomas Kosicky's goal. The strike was similar to the 21-year-old's opener against Besiktas in Tottenham's last Europa League encounter and the effort provided the platform for a flurry of goals for the hosts. After two sublime goals from Erik Lamela, Kane was on the score sheet again with a close-range tap in after Kosicky had spilled Moussa Dembele's stinging drive, to make the score 4-0. Just minutes later the Tottenham academy graduate completed his first hat-trick for the club heading home Federico Fazio's cross to take home the match ball.

Kane (far right) tries to organise his wall as Tottenham defend the free-kick that Lloris gave away . Kane (centre) fails to handle Jeronimo Barrales' tame free-kick as the ball slips under his grasp into the net . Reflecting on his three goals, Kane added: 'It [the first] was a sweet strike. When it left the foot I knew it had a chance and fortunately it came of the post and went in which is always nice. 'I thought it was good to get the second and third as well, extra goals when the team is dead on their feet and when we want to start killing off teams and getting the five goals was great.' He's evidently better at scoring goals than keeping them out, but on current form the 21-year-old is pressing his claim for a starting birth in Pochettino's Premier League team. Kane has now scored six goals in nine appearances for the club this season and with Spurs at home to Newcastle next in the Premier League - he'll be looking to add to his tally if given the chance on Sunday. Despite his comical goalkeeping error Kane was pleased with a display that saw him collect the match ball .

"Burnley boss Sean Dyche insists his side have the character to bounce back from their growing streak of disappointments and beat the odds by securing Barclays Premier League survival. The Clarets go in search of their first top-flight win at their ninth attempt against Everton at Turf Moor on Sunday. A second-half lapse cost his men dear against West Ham last week but Dyche is adamant there is still the desire within his camp to turn things round. Sean Dyche (above) admits Burnley are learning as they go, but has praised players desire to improve form . Dean Marney (above) could be available for Dyche as an alternative option in midfield after injury recovery . Dyche said: ""We are having to learn as we go. ""There is no doubting the players' physical power, their energy, their endeavour and belief - but it comes down to quality and awareness and experience. ""We haven't got a very experienced Premier League squad and we have had some tough lessons already. ""We believe this group is honest enough to keep learning and not be broken by it. You just get dented and you take the knocks and come off the ropes and get ready to take it again. ""We hope to use that mentality wisely over the season and the next step is to use it to learn how to win."" It has been a tough season already for Burnley supporters, whose side are nineteenth in the Premier League . Dyche hopes midfielder Dean Marney will be fit to return after missing three games with a hamstring injury while Steven Reid is also pushing for a recall. Despite Everton's inconsistent start to the season and a midweek trip to France in the UEFA Europa League, Dyche is under no illusions about the difficulties of finally claiming a three-point haul on Sunday. Dyche added: ""They have had an indifferent start to the season by their standards but they are a great club with a great manager and these are the kinds of challenges we wanted last year. ""The players want it and the town wants it. We have gone up to a different level and we are creating chances. it is all about delivering that cutting edge that we know is there.""","Burnley boss Sean Dyche admits his side are 'learning as they go'

"Harry Kane savoured a 'great night' under the White Hart Lane floodlights as his hat-trick helped Tottenham to a 5-1 Europa League victory over Asteras Tripoli. The England Under-21 striker not only scored his first treble for Spurs but ended the Group C clash in goal after Hugo Lloris’ late sending-off. He was left red-faced however, after making a complete hash of dealing with Jeronimo Barrales' free-kick, letting the effort go under his body as the Greeks grabbed a late consolation. Harry Kane ended the night in goal and let Jeronimo Barrales' rather tame free-kick slip out of his grasp . The England youngster won't want to re-live his gaffe  which saw the visitors claim a sloppy consolation . Kane finished the match in goal after Hugo Lloris (pictured) was sent off in the closing stages on Thursday . 'It was a great night until I went in goal,' he told ITV4. 'In fairness I think I’ll leave that to the keepers from now on. 'It was a great result for us, a great win, and obviously I’m happy to get the hat-trick.'

Erik Lamela, who scored a double for the hosts, including his incredible 'Rabona' congratulates Kane . Erik Lamela threatened to steal the limelight from Kane with two awe-inspiring strikes of his own. The Argentina forward brought the 21,428 spectators to their feet on the half-hour mark by wrapping his left foot around his right leg to score with a ‘rabona’ strike from the edge of the box. Lamela then doubled his night’s tally with a fine volley in the second half and Kane was pleased to see his team-mate get on the scoresheet. 'I’ve seen him do it (on the training ground),' Kane added. 'He’s got that in the locker, so it’s great for him to see it pay off on the big stage of a game and I’m very happy for him because it is two goals.' Tottenham’s night was slightly soured by the 87th-minute dismissal of Lloris and Jeronimo Barrales’ subsequent consolation strike moments later that Kane let slip through his grasp after he had replaced the Frenchman in goal. Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino hailed his side’s effort going forward but his side’s failure to keep a clean sheet seemingly irked the former Southampton manager. He said: 'No, I’m not satisfied because for me, the result, it is important to get the three points but the last goal make me a little bit unsatisfied.'","Kane scored a hat-trick to help Tottenham beat Asteras Tripoli 5-1 .

"Roberto Martinez claims Everton captain Phil Jagielka never paid any attention to the criticism of his performances in the early part of the season. Jagielka has looked back to his best in recent weeks after a tough start to the campaign following a disappointing World Cup with England. The Toffees have kept clean sheets in their last two matches against Lille and Aston Villa, and ahead of their trip to Burnley, Martinez insists centre-back Jagielka blanked those who blamed him for Everton's early defensive woes and believed in his own ability. Phil Jagielka has looked back to his best in recent weeks after a tough start to this season's campaign . 'I'd said Phil is at an outstanding level now,' Martinez said. 'Criticism shouldn't affect any player. As a team we wanted to start the season brightly, but we conceded cheaply. 'However you can see the reaction of the team and individual players. 'But I don't think as a manager you make decisions based on criticism. I don't think you need to take players like him out of the firing line or anything like that.

'It's been enjoyable to see his level of form, building partnerships with different players. 'The whole back four have had a good defensive focus.

"Erik Lamela's astonishing rabona strike was one of the best goals Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino has ever seen. Some had written off the club-record £30million signing after a disappointing, albeit injury-interrupted, first season with the north Londoners. Lamela is, though, at last beginning to show glimpses of his undoubted quality under the tutorship of former Argentina international Pochettino. Erik Lamela's astonishing rabona strike put Tottenham in control against Asteras Tripolis . Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino seemed unimpressed by Lamela's goal at the time . The attacking midfielder has yet to find the consistency his compatriot desires but impressed against Asteras Tripolis, scoring a brace as Spurs won the Europa League clash 5-1. Lamela's second of the Group C encounter was an impressive volley from an acute angle, but the first was one of the finest goals ever seen at White Hart Lane - a rabona strike from the edge of the box. 'One time I scored one goal like that myself,' Pochettino said, laughing. 'You will find it on YouTube. 'No, it was a very big goal, a great goal, an unbelievable goal. I am happy for him and it helped us to get the three points. Maybe it is the best [by one of my players ever]. Probably.' Pochettino gives Lamela a pat on the back after his goalscoring exploits . Replays of the goal led to oohs and aahs from the Spurs faithful, yet Pochettino sat motionless on the bench when the strike went in. 'I never show emotion,' he said, offering an explanation. 'No, I show emotion at home and show it in my bed. 'It is true, I am a manager that tries to be calm every time during the game. 'Sometimes I am very disappointed and angry, but I enjoy more after the game rather than during the game.' Harry Kane marked his return to the side with a hat-trick in the Europa League romp . That anger includes the performance of his side in the closing stages of the match. Harry Kane, fresh from netting his first hat-trick for Spurs, had to don the goalkeeper's gloves for the final minutes after Hugo Lloris was sent off for bundling over Tasos Tsokanis. The resulting free-kick from Jeronimo Barrales squirmed through Kane's grasp - a frustrating end to what had been for large parts an impressive display by Spurs. 'It was okay,' Pochettino said. 'I am happy for the result, 5-1, and disappointed with the last five minutes because we gave the possibility for them to play one v one with our 'keeper. Kane ended the game between the sticks after Hugo Lloris saw red late on . 'We need to manage better the game. I am disappointed with the last five minutes but after that happy with the result. Our objective was to get the three points and it was done. 'I think that Hugo's behaviour was correct. Unlucky because it was a red card but I am not happy with the last minutes because our line defensive was very high. 'We gave the possibility to play in behind our defensive line and at 5-0, with three minutes before the end of the game, we were not ready and focused in that action. 'We gave them the possibility to play well one v one with the keeper and for that I am not happy.'","Lamela bagged a brace in 5-1 Europa League romp against Asteras Tripolis .

"Erik Lamela hopes his Europa League wondergoal can breathe life into his Tottenham career.

The Spain Under-21 striker announced his arrival on the Premier League stage with United’s winner at Spurs on Sunday, climbing to head home a Remy Cabella cross. The effort - which sealed a 2-1 victory - was his first goal since signing for the Magpies in a £1.5million deal from Tenerife in June and came on his full league debut.

Newcastle, however, had to beat off competition from a host of Spanish clubs to land the pacey frontman, who scored 16 times in the Segunda Division last season and was nominated for the best ‘breakthrough player’ award. But only now has the 21-year-old confirmed that Real and Barca were among those chasing his signature. ‘Yes, there was interest from Barcelona and Real Madrid,’ he said. ‘The truth is that the Newcastle bid was quite surprising because firstly there were other teams interested. ‘But they pushed very hard to get me.

"Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini took much encouragement from last season's derby dominance - and intends to send his team out seeking exactly the same this weekend. City head into Sunday's much-hyped clash with Manchester United at the Etihad Stadium short of form but with Pellegrini vowing to stick to his default, attack-based philosophy. Questions are being asked of the champions' durability after a run of three games without a win but Pellegrini brushed off similar doubts a year ago, with a 4-1 thrashing of United at home sending out clear signals. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has watched his side really struggle in recent weeks . Sergio Aguero celebrates scoring for Manchester City as they thumped United at the Etihad last season . Toure was on song as United were beaten 3-0 by City towards the end of last season . Pellegrini, whose side also beat United 3-0 on their way to winning the Barclays Premier League, said: 'I always say I am not the kind of manager that thinks when you win (it is) because you did (one) single thing. 'I think it is very important to play in one way and have absolute trust in your players, and I think always the players make the difference. 'The (derby) game we played here was in a moment when I was new here, when maybe there were a lot of doubts about the results that we were taking, especially away. 'But I didn't change in my mind the way we had to play against every team. I talked with my players and told them to play in the way we did every game, working in training sessions. 'I think that was an important moment and we really played very well.' The passions evoked by the derby could be what City need to help rediscover their spark after a difficult past 10 days. Newcastle knocked City out of the League Cup after goals from Rolando Aarons and Moussa Sissoko (above) Pellegrini (above) watched his side lose 2-1 to West Ham in the last Premier League game . Diafra Sakho rises highest to head home the second goal for West Ham to put them 2-0 up against City . City keeper Joe Hart lies helpless in the net as Sakho runs off in celebration after his goal . City surrendered a two-goal lead to draw at CSKA Moscow in their faltering Champions League campaign and then lost at West Ham last week. To compound matters, they were then dumped out of the Capital One Cup by under-strength Newcastle on Wednesday. But Pellegrini, who faces a critical few days with CSKA Moscow visiting Eastlands next Wednesday, does not want to place too much emphasis on this particular fixture. The Chilean said: 'It doesn't depend on what we do the game before the derby. It is important for us to play against Manchester United or QPR next week, or CSKA Moscow, in the same way we normally do. That is the most important thing.' While Pellegrini may hope the outcome might be the same as last year, the United side they are facing has changed. Pellegrini played down the importance of the managers as he prepares to face Louis van Gaal . Louis van Gaal has replaced David Moyes as manager and upwards of £150million has been spent on new players to reinvigorate the team. Pellegrini, just a week after being nominated for coach of the year, could find himself coming under scrutiny if his team's poor sequence continues. But the 61-year-old wants the attention in the derby to be on the action, not the managers. He said: 'I think on Sunday we play Manchester City against Manchester United and last year was exactly the same. 'It was not me against David Moyes and Sunday will not be me against Louis van Gaal. It is a game for both teams and that is the important thing.' Spanish playmaker David Silva will miss the derby after coming off injured against Newcastle United . Pellegrini said that Sergio Aguero will be a very important player for City in Sunday's derby . City are without in-form playmaker David Silva, who has been ruled out for three weeks with a knee injury. But one on-song player still available is Sergio Aguero, who struck four against Tottenham in City's last home win. Pellegrini said: 'I think Sergio will always be a very important player for us. 'He only played some minutes (20) against Newcastle because he played three games in a row of 90 minutes - but I think he is improving every game and he will always make the difference.'","Man City welcome rivals Manchester United to the Etihad on Sunday .

"Dennis Tueart - who spent eight years playing for Manchester City - believes Sergio Aguero is the most fearsome striker to play a part in Sunday's derby. The 64-year-old, who notched 86 league goals for City, believes the Argentine has that added edge as Manchester United travel to the Etihad Stadium. SERGIO AGUERO 9.5 . The fulcrum of City’s attack. Defenders want everything happening in front of them but he always looks to get in behind. His strength and low centre of gravity make him hard to throw off the ball and his explosive pace and ability to go on either foot make him lethal. SUPER STAT: Aguero (9) has scored more league goals this season than Wayne Rooney (3), Robin van Persie (3) and Radamel Falcao (1) combined. Sergio Aguero celebrates scoring for Manchester City as they thumped United at the Etihad last season . EDIN DZEKO 8 . An excellent all-round game and such a great finisher in and around the box, but that’s where he should stay rather than dropping deep or drifting out wide. SUPER STAT: Dzeko has scored four goals in five Premier League games against United. RADAMEL FALCAO 8 . Wants to be involved in everything in the attacking third. He’s got that Denis Law syndrome – he has an incredible hunger to get in the box and score. That desire combined with pace and technique makes him a natural lone finisher. SUPER STAT: Falcao has two assists in just five Premier League games. Rooney is the only United or City striker who can match that figure. Radamel Falcao has two assists in five Premier League games - a stat only matched by Wayne Rooney . Bosnian striker Edin Dzeko will be lurking for opportunities during Sunday's derby at the Etihad Stadium . Rooney is the all-time top goalscorer in the Manchester derby with 11 - and four in his last five away clashes . WAYNE ROONEY 8.5 . His skillset makes him a natural No 10 rather than an out-and-out front man. He’s got skill, runs with the ball, passes well and can finish. That’s why he is more effective coming from deep. SUPER STAT: Rooney is the top scorer in Manchester Derby history with 11. He has four in his last five league visits to the Etihad. ROBIN VAN PERSIE 8 . His mixed form has been representative of United’s transition. He was bought by Fergie, struggled under Moyes but now looks like he’s improving again under Van Gaal.

"Click here to read Adam Crafton's special report on De Gea's journey from Spain to Manchester. Manchester United fans have picked goalkeeper David de Gea as the club's Player of the Month for October, with the Spaniard picking a whopping 70 per cent of the votes in an online poll. Despite failing to keep a clean sheet during the month, De Gea was in fine form as United beat Everton before drawing away at West Brom and at home to Premier League leaders Chelsea. The 23-year-old kept out a Leighton Baines penalty and pulled off two memorable late saves to deny the Toffees a point at Old Trafford, before notably thwarting Eden Hazard when the Belgian was clear through on goal during United's 1-1 draw with Jose Mourinho's side.

I know we have one of the best fan bases in the world and they believe in me, which is good for me. 'I am very happy with them. They have supported me in every game and they are always behind me. They are amazing.' Perhaps De Gea's most important save in October arrived against Roberto Martinez's side when he flung himself across goal to save Bryan Oviedo's impressive volley in added time. The save ensured Louis van Gaal's side earned a second consecutive win, something which was not lost on the former Atletico Madrid stopper. Speaking about keeping out the Costa Rican's effort, De Gea said: 'I think every save is important for the goalkeepers and for the team, but maybe in this game the save in the last minute can be the most important save, perhaps more than the penalty in the first half.'

'We are aware that he is having a good season with Napoli,' Del Bosque said in an interview with Diario de la Roja, a publication dedicated to the Spanish national team. Napoli's Jose Callejon could win his first call up to the Spain squad for November's international fixtures . 'Why wouldn't he be included in the next squad?' the coach added. 'But look, we not going to guarantee he will be there.' Spain, the defending European champions, continue their Euro 2016 qualification bid with a game against Group C rivals Belarus in Huelva on November 15 and play a friendly against 2014 World Cup winners Germany in Pontevedra three days later. With three matches played, Spain are joint second in the pool on six points with Ukraine, three points behind Slovakia, who surprised Del Bosque's side this month by beating them 2-1 in Zilina. Macedonia have three points in fourth and Belarus and Luxembourg each have one point. The 27-year-old is the top scorer in Serie A this season with seven goals in nine appearances .","Jose Callejon is Serie A's top scorer this season with seven goals .

"Garry Monk takes his Swansea side to a revitalised Everton on Saturday believing it is no coincidence that the Toffees' upturn in form has come with Ross Barkley finally over his early-season injury problems. Everton have won both Barclays Premier League games Barkley has been involved in since the 20-year-old England talent missed the first two months of the season with a knee injury. Roberto Martinez's side scored six goals in beating Aston Villa and Burnley to move into ninth spot after a sticky start to the campaign and they would leapfrog sixth-placed Swansea by beating them at Goodison Park. Ross Barkley has been in fine form as Everton have improved on their early-season form . Swansea have never won on the blue half of Merseyside and Monk has identified Barkley - who scored in both Everton league wins against them last season - as the main threat to his team creating club history. 'Barkley is a top player, a real talent,' Swansea manager Monk said. 'He plays with no fear and he is a big factor for them. 'They missed him when he was out. Since he's come back he's done well and, if he stays fit, he will only get better. 'He is right up there as a young English talent. I know he has been likened to quite a few players and ability-wise and talent-wise he is showing that week in, week out. 'He's only just come back from his injury so whether he is at his full best right now I don't know, but he is right up there. 'Roberto will give him the freedom to express himself, but he can attack and defend and he is an all-rounder.' Swansea beat Everton for the first time in 21 attempts in the Capital One Cup in September . Swansea claimed their first win in 21 attempts against Everton in September when Monk's men ran out comfortable 3-0 Capital One Cup winners at the Liberty Stadium. They also claimed a first win in six league games with a 2-0 victory over Leicester last weekend, but Monk knows the size of the challenge ahead as he once more comes up against his former Swansea manager Martinez. 'We beat them before but that was in the cup and the league will be a different situation,' Monk said, . 'Goodison is a really tough place to go but we go there with confidence after an important win against Leicester, which was a bit of justification for the lads. 'We are not expected to get anything from the game, but we are sixth in the league and have good momentum. 'We can go there with freedom and put on a performance that warrants some points.' Swansea were in front against Liverpool in the cup this week before they were knocked out . Everton have had a rare free week to prepare for the game without any European distractions, while Swansea have already been on Merseyside this week in losing 2-1 to Liverpool in the Capital One Cup. Monk knows the strain that playing in the Europa League puts on players after Swansea's participation in the tournament last season but he believes Everton have now adjusted to the demands of juggling domestic and European commitments. 'The games come thick and fast and you get out of the routine with games on Thursday and Sunday,' Monk said. 'We learnt it's an adjustment last season when we were in the Europa League, but they are a more experienced squad in Europe. 'They are showing they are right back to where they were last season. 'We go there as underdogs given the form they are in, but we're confident we can go up there and do something.'","Ross Barkley's return from injury has helped boost Everton's form .

"Birmingham held Wolves to a gritty goalless draw at Molineux as the visitors bounced back from last weekend's embarrassing 8-0 defeat against Bournemouth. The point was enough to temporarily take Kenny Jackett's side top ahead of the later fixtures - but it was an uninspiring Midlands derby. Dave Edwards hit the bar for Wolves while Birmingham's Jonathan Grounds escaped a clear handball in the area. Birmingham bounced back from last week's heavy defeat at home to Bouremouth to claim a point . Wolves' Lee Evans attempts to keep the ball away from Birmingham's David Davis . Gary Rowett took charge of his first match since taking over the reins at St Andrew's . Wolves: Ikeme, Doherty, Batth, Ebanks-Landell, Rowe, McDonald, Evans, Henry, Jacobs (Sako 56), McAlinden (Edwards 56), Clarke (Sagbo 79). Subs not used: Stearman, Saville, Van La Parra, Flatt. Booked: Clarke . Birmingham: Randolph, Caddis, Morrison, Robinson, Grounds, Gleeson, Davis, Cotterill, Shinnie (Reilly 66), Arthur (Shea 64), Donaldson (Thomas 77). Subs not used: Eardley, Hall, Doyle, Brown. Booked: Davis, Thomas, Caddis . Referee: Anthony Taylor . Attendance: 25,135 . Koby Arthur and Clayton Donaldson wasted the committed visitors' best chances in Gary Rowett's first game in charge. He made four changes from the side thumped 8-0 at home by Bournemouth last week, 48 hours before his appointment. In came debutant Michael Morrison, on loan from Charlton, David Davis, Andrew Shinnie and Arthur. Liam McAlinden started for Wolves after he was recalled from his loan spell at Fleetwood after Bakary Sako, who was on the bench, failed to recover fully from a groin injury. Nouha Dicko was ruled out with a hamstring problem, with Leon Clarke replacing him up front. And the striker had Darren Randolph scrambling to turn his looping header over on six minutes. With plenty of the ball Wolves were able to dictate the play but failed to seriously test a Birmingham side who shipped eight in their last game. Randolph gathered James Henry's 18-yard effort but Rowett would have been encouraged by his side's solid, if unspectacular start.

Birmingham teenager Koby Arhur (centre) dribbles with the ball while two Wolves defenders close him down . Slowly though, the visitors did begin to create and Arthur blazed into the side-netting after being left to pick up David Cotterill's deep free-kick. And in the 26th minute Donaldson smashed wide after robbing Kevin McDonald as Wolves' nerves grew. Without the dynamism of Sako and Dicko the one-dimensional hosts failed to penetrate the visitors and were reduced to long, hopeful, balls going forward. The pattern continued after the break with Wolves stifled by hard-working Birmingham - although they survived a scare 10 minutes into the second half. Henry found space and crossed, only for the ball to hit Grounds' outstretched arm in the area - but Wolves' strong penalty claims were rejected. Five minutes later Grounds forced Carl Ikeme into action, the goalkeeper parrying his header from Cotterill's corner. But Wolves had been the better side since the restart and McDonald flashed a low drive wide before Randolph tipped Edwards' header over after he spilled substitute Sako's cross. Edwards then chipped onto the bar on 71 minutes as Birmingham retreated and they were indebted to Randolph a minute from time. Brek Shea was left by Henry and his low cross was smartly kept out by the keeper, with Sako blazing the rebound over. McDonald and Davis challenge for the ball as they look to win possession for their respective sides .","Birmingham bounced back from last week's embarrassing 8-0 defeat against Bournemouth .
