"Working out in warm water could be a radical new cure for high blood pressure, research shows. So-called hot aquarobics could even be a remedy for thousands of patients who do not respond to medication, scientists claim. The findings come from a study where patients whose blood pressure remained high despite trying at least three different drugs exercised three times a week in water heated to 32C (90F). Hot aquarobics can even cut blood pressure in people with very high readings, researchers claim . Researchers found blood pressure readings that stubbornly refused to budge in response to pills fell significantly when patients did aquarobics. But they believe the temperature of the water could be crucial as previous studies which looked at blood pressure response to aquarobics performed in water heated to 27 degrees found less of a benefit. Most public swimming pools in the UK are kept at around 28 to 30 degrees, although pools used by babies, toddlers and the disabled are usually warmer at around 32 degrees. High blood pressure, or hypertension, affects one in five adults in the UK and is thought to be responsible for half of all heart attacks and strokes. In some patients, it's possible to get readings down by eating less salt and taking more exercise. But thousands more need pills to control it, which they must take for the rest of their lives. However, up to 30 per cent of patients diagnosed with the condition do not respond to medication. The heat of the water expands the blood vessels improving the flow of blood around the body . Once they have tried and failed on three different classes of drugs, they are regarded as 'resistant' to blood pressure medicine. As a result, their risk of suffering heart attacks or strokes increases significantly. Regular exercise is recognised as one of the best ways to get blood pressure down. But many elderly, obese or arthritic patients find it difficult to exercise if it means putting added strain on their muscles and joints. Working out in water has long been regarded as a useful alternative. But the latest research, published in the International Journal of Cardiology, suggests the hotter it is the better. Doctors at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil recruited 32 men and women who had resistant hypertension for five years or more and had repeatedly failed to improve on drugs. All the patients had readings over 140mmHg/90mmHg. Ideal blood pressure is around 120mmHg/80mmHg. Half the group were told to carry on with their normal exercise routines and the rest were given three one-hour sessions a week of aquarobics in a heated pool. Throughout the experiment they all carried on taking tablets. Each session included a five minute warm up, 20 minutes of callisthenics - light exercises pushing against the water - and 30 minutes of walking in the pool at a pace that was slightly tiring. The last five minutes were spent cooling down and stretching. The results showed that, over a 12-week period, blood pressure levels dropped significantly by an average of 36mmHg/12mmHg in the hot aquarobics group. Even a decline of just 5mmHg/2mm Hg can slash the risk of heart attacks and strokes by up to 14 per cent. In contrast, the group that did not exercise in water saw an overall increase in readings. Hot aquarobics could even reduce blood pressure in people for whom medication has failed to work . Researchers pointed out blood pressure did not only decline immediately after exercise. Three days later patients still showed lower readings. It's not clear why warm water has this effect. One theory is that heat dilates blood vessels, improving the flow of blood through the body. In a report on their findings the researchers said: 'Our findings indicate that heated water-based exercise is an effective therapy in patients not responsive to drug treatment.' Doireann Maddock, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: 'This small study reinforces the value of a regular exercise plan combined with appropriate medication in the treatment of high blood pressure, although the practicalities of exercising in a pool heated to 32 degrees present a challenge. 'Getting a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity throughout the week will help keep your heart healthy.'","Hot aquarobics takes place in water heated to 32C (90F)

"Forget Furbys and Cabbage Patch dolls, for the children of Nazi Germany sinister toy soldiers depicting Hitler and his henchmen were top of their wish lists during World War Two. Miniature figurines of the evil German dictator, complete with an adjustable right arm to allow youngsters to mimic a Nazi salute, were among the sought-after toys used to brainwash children in the Third Reich. The toys were discovered as part of two . rare collections which sold at auction - one at Durham and the second at . Dudley in the West Midlands - for more than £7,000. Scroll down for video . Two rare collections of sinister toy soldiers and Nazi buildings, have fetched more than £7,000 at auction. The top lot, pictured, features figurines of Adolf Hitler and his second in command Rudolf Hess . Among the toys in the two rare collections was a figurine of Adolf Hitler raising his right arm in salute with his mistress Eva Braun, on a podium emblazoned with a Swastika . A rare replica of a SA watch post, among the sought-after toys for children in Nazi Germany . Accompanying the Nazi leader, a figurine of his mistress Eva Braun and a podium emblazoned with a Nazi Swastika. Another, . an intricate wooden model of a Nazi headquarters building, also . features Hitler's second in command and deputy Fuhrer Rudolf Hess. Other toys found among the . collections include soldiers of Germany's Wehrmacht in various poses, . including two lying on the ground taking aim with a rifle and another . charging with a bayonet. The toys were mass produced during World War Two as part of the Nazi propaganda machine. Toy . shops in the Third Reich stocked the figures and Nazi buildings, which . were aimed at influencing children, encouraging them to become members . of the Hitler Youth. They were made from a delicate composition of plaster, glue, sawdust and linseed oil by toy company Elastolin. Very few models have survived, and the two rare collections were snapped up by private collectors of the scarcely seen models. Also featured in the lots were rare models of SA soldiers, also known as the Brown Shirts - the first Nazi paramilitary group . The toys were mass produced during World War Two as part of Hitler's powerful propaganda machine . Another group of figures shows a marching band of the Hitler Youth . The top lot - the model of Nazi headquarters, the Brown House in Munich - fetched a staggering £1,202 as part of a 22-piece set, when it went up for sale at Vectis Auctions in Stockton-on-Tees in Durham. Simon Clarke, military consultant at Vectis, said: 'These figures were made by a company called Evastolin in about 1935 and they had been making toys since the turn of the century. 'Toy production basically stopped in 1930 in the UK but Germany was still producing toys up until 1944. 'When the Nazis came into power the toy production was geared to show what was happening in Germany. 'They didn't continue to make many other toys, apart from a few for very small children such as building blocks. 'The toys were used to try and encourage children into the Hitler Youth, and children could also join as younger members from seven or eight, they were geared towards that.' Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, left, and his deputy Rudolf Hess, right, were among the prominent figures immortalised . Mr Clarke added: 'Propaganda was so important that Joseph Goebbels told the makers to improve the features on the personality figures, so they started to make the heads out of porcelain. 'A figurine of Rudolf Hess, which came with the headquarters model, had a movable right arm and the head was also made out of porcelain, which makes it very rare. 'The items were gathered by an expert collector in Germany who scours Eastern Europe for these items and sells them in the UK.' The second toy collection originated . from the estate of a late British diplomat and sold for 35,801 at . Ashton's Auctioneers in Dudley in the West Midlands. The lot featured the podium toy with figures of Hitler and his mistress Eva Braun. The figures feature adjustable right arms to allow children to mimic Adolf Hitler's Nazi salute . A march of the banners at the Nazi's Nuremberg Rally, held annually from 1923 to 1938 . There were also dozens of Hitler Youth models which had been cast in various positions including playing musical instruments and waving flags. Chris Aston, owner of Aston's, said: 'The Nazis would have been aiming to mass market the toys because it was all part of the propaganda, getting the children involved and in the Hitler Youth. 'At the time, they would been what every child wanted. 'Items like this fall into a niche market as a lot of people don't want to collect them because of the history behind them.'","Figures of the Nazi leader were sought-after in the Third Reich .

"Jesse Helt was given 30 days in county jail, placed on supervised probation for 12 months and fined $572 and ordered to pay restitution. In February 2012, he made Polk County's Most Wanted List . The homeless man who accepted Miley Cyrus's VMA gong is on the run from police after breaking probation following a drugs test, it has been claimed, just as he heads home. Jesse Helt, 22, told MailOnline he is looking forward to seeing his mother, but his homecoming may have a sting - in 2011, a judge in his home state of Oregon issued a warrant for his arrest for repeatedly violating the terms of his probation. Helt could be arrested on arrival. He was arrested in October 2010 after he tried to break into a flat where he said a man had sold 'bad marijuana' to him. He was charged with burglary, criminal mischief in the third degree and criminal trespass in the 1st degree. The burglary charge was later dismissed. On November 23 of the same year, he was given 30 days in county jail, placed on supervised probation for 12 months and fined $572 and ordered to pay restitution. In mugshots obtained by MailOnline, Helt was booked on probation violations on July 24, 2011 and August 22, 2011. In February 2012, Helt made the Most Wanted . List for Polk County. He was listed number two on the list wanted for . first degree trespass. Local Judicial Services Specialist Jon Troike told The Sun: 'He still has an outstanding warrant. If he's contacted by the police in Oregon he would be arrested.' Helt is accused of using marijuana, not providing a urine sample, failing to report to his probation officer, not abiding by the set curfew and not completing community service as mandated. Last night Helt boarded the 7.50pm Alaska Airlines flight from Los Angeles International Airport that took him back home, the $360 economy ticket paid for by Cyrus . Scroll down for video . Home: Jesse arrives home after Miley Cyrus paid for his flight home to see his mother for the first time in three years . Run-in with the law: In this mugshot dated October 30, 2010, Helt has longer hair . after his arrest for breaking into a man's flat who had sold him 'bad . marijuana' Wanted: In this booking mugshot taken on August 22, 2011, Helt has gotten rid of his longer hair. In that year a judge in his home state of Oregon issued an arrest warrant for repeatedly violating the terms of his probation . He was wearing scruffy black jeans, trainers and a black hoodie and had no luggage with him other than a small carry-on sports bag and a skate-board, which he clutched under his arm. He left the aeroplane behind other passengers and the were no family or friends to greet him as he walked through the airport. Instead Helt took a taxi for the 45-mile journey back home to Salem, south of Portland. Speaking briefly to a MailOnline reporter on the same plane, Helt said that he was ‘glad’ to be finally back home. ‘I miss my mom, I haven’t seen her in three years,’ he added. And referring to his troubles which began when he was a teenager and led to him living homeless in Los Angeles, he added: ‘I’ve been suffering since I was the age of 13, but I’m glad to be back home.’ Miley Cyrus paid the $360 economy ticket for Jesse Helt to go back to Salem, Oregon . Jesse Helt, the would-be model, and Jesse Helt, the internationally famous friend of Miley Cyrus . Helt became famous when took to the stage to accept Cyrus's gong and made a speech about homeless young people in California that reduced the singer and many of the audience to tears. Cyrus reportedly 'auditioned' 'six or seven homeless kids' before choosing Helt to accompany her to the VMAs, according to The Sun. Linda Helt, 62, told MailOnline: 'Jesse's had ups and downs like anybody else... he didn't wanna give up and run on home to mommy, but only he knows the reasons, that's for him to say.' Speaking from her home, Mrs Helt, who has three other sons and a daughter, said: 'He wanted to be in Los Angeles and he had opportunities and he took them, but you know, he's had his ups and downs like anybody else. 'It was his choice, he was always welcome, he could always come back any time. If he needed help, I'd help him, we help one another,’ she added. Helt grew up in Salem, and he went to Chapman Hill Elementary, Myers Elementary and West Salem High School. Mrs Helt said that her son moved to Los Angeles a few years ago: 'Because he wanted to make it on his own.' Stunned by his appearance on the VMAs on Sunday night, Mrs Helt said: 'This will change his life, absolutely. This will turn things around for him and I believe God is the one that is doing it, God is making a difference and Jesse believes that. 'He's a good kid. He was nervous up there on stage, but that's how it is when you have a passion for something like he does. Somebody's helping him and he wants to help someone too.' Mrs Helt praised Miley for taking action on youth homelessness. 'Miley has taken Jesse to her heart and I’m really glad for Jesse,' she said. Mrs Helt told The Oregonian said Jesse had called her at 1am  following his appearance at the VMAs, revealing was now flying home after Miley gave him some money. He likes long hair: Helt had toned down his hair by the time he took to the VMA stage on Sunday night . She told that at one point, Jesse's living situation in LA became so bad he called her and said: 'Mom, I'm living in a bush!' Delighted with the attention her son has got, she said: 'It's time for him to have some good luck. He needs to be blessed.' Just a cursory look online reveals that Jesse had attempted a career as a model, posting pictures on the Model Mayhem website and writing: 'I'm Jesse and I just moved here from Salem, Oregon about a year ago. If your interested in working with me please shoot me an email. I'm not turning down any work right now and would love to work with all kinds of photographers.' He also posed for photographer Zell Thomas and on his Facebook page describes himself as 'really super nice' and a 'Christian'. Cyrus, 21, told Ryan Seacrest on his radio show that she chose to this year's VMAs to spread an important message after last year's racy duet with Robin Thicke made headlines across the world, saying: 'I just didn't realise my platform, I didn't realize my power. 'I really realised it after the VMAs [last year] … there's something special and there’s only few people that experience this that no matter what I do, there's no winning or losing, it’s just going to be talked about. Period.' She added: 'There's going to be talk, so what do I want them to talk about? If I'm going to be given this loud of a voice and this big of an image and this big of a platform and this huge of an opportunity to talk to young people in American right now, what am I really trying to say? Because I don’t think what I was trying to say is what happened the year before.' And she admitted she kept things so hush hush that she did not tell anyone about her plan - even her friend Katy Perry, whom she was sitting near at the VMAs. It's a long way from Oregon to the VMAs: Jesse Helt (left) back in Salem with an equally hirsute friend . During the show, Miley even pretended that Jesse was her boyfriend, prompting Katy to offer him a drink, as Miley laughed: 'I'm like, ""This kid has to give this speech!"" 'I’m like, ""Katy, please don't get Jesse drunk right now"" … I didn't want to tell her because I was scared if someone found out, they’d try to stop me … no one knew. The only person I told, because I knew that he would respect it, was Juicy [J], who was sitting next to me. I couldn't hold it in, I was so excited. I knew that he would respect Jesse and it was cool to have someone there who could keep us both calm.' Pictured sitting on the side of the stage with a nervous Jesse gave his speech, Cyrus said: 'The courage that he showed to get up there and give that speech. 'I didn’t know how everyone was going to be and seeing his hands shake, it kind of broke me. I wish they wouldn’t have kept putting the camera on me to make it about me crying. I cry when I’m the happiest.' And as for her Moonman trophy - Cyrus said that Helt gets to keep the statue. It came as a complete surprise to the millions of viewers and the audience when Helt walked up to collect Miley's trophy. My Friend's Place Executive Director, Heather Carmichael, told MailOnline that Helt was 'incredibly brave' to stand up and talk at the VMAs. But she said the charity wasn’t aware that he would be invited to speak at the awards ceremony, saying: 'We did not know about the invitation and we certainly didn’t know what that evening would look like. ‘But I really feel like that Miley has a genuine intention to raise awareness and it's stunning for this issue. 'This issue exists in every community and people are stepping over these young people on the street and don’t want to acknowledge that there's a problem.'","Jesse Helt, 22, accepted the Video of the Year Award on Miley Cyrus's behalf .

"We are not shy about our love of a bearded man on the Femail pages at MailOnline. From Mr Incredibeard to the flame-haired John Lewis model, boys with facial fuzz are floating our boat right now, and so when these pictures of Jigsaw's latest campaign landed on our desk we paid attention.

"These haunting images show the inside of the Führerbunker - the underground hideaway where Hitler and Eva Braun took their own lives after the fall of Berlin. The death of Adolf Hitler, then 56, and Eva Braun, 33, in the heart of Berlin on April 30, 1945, is widely regarded as the fall of the Third Reich. The couple lived the last few months of their lives together in the Führerbunker - with Hitler controlling his failing military operation from the base. They are even thought to have wed in the hideaway the day before their suicide. These extraordinary pictures reveal inside Hitler's bunker. This room is thought to have been the Fuhrer's command center conference room - which was partially burned out by SS troops and stripped of evidence by invading Russians in 1945 . A ripped, blood stained and burnt sofa inside the bunker - which was located  under the Reichschancellery building in the heart of Berlin. Hitler lived in the Führerbunker with Braun for the last months of the war . Debris lies scatted on a make-shift desk near to the sofa. Photographer William Vandivert was the first western man to gain access to the disturbing bunker two weeks after Hitler's death . War correspondents examine the arm of a sofa stained with blood - which could have belonged to Hitler . Historians believe . Hitler took his own life by shooting himself in the temple, with Braun ingesting cyanide. Two weeks after their death and the subsequent fall of Berlin, William Vandivert became the first western man to photograph the so-called 'shelter for the leader' - with this collection of images published shortly afterwards in Life Magazine. Also published were a selection of photographs capturing a city destroyed by the Second World War. In one of Vandiver's eerie shots, ripped pictures can be seen hanging an odd angles on the walls, while piles of broken furniture lays scattered around the room. In another, a moldy SS officer's hat lies abandoned on the floor. Another picture of the sofa in the dim and grotty room of the bunker . Ripped documents line the bottom of a large container near to a desk. The series of images were published in Life Magazine in July 1945 .

The photographer also documented a war-torn Berlin, noting how hundreds of buildings in the city had been destroyed by bombs . Thousands were also left without anywhere to live - with hundreds of residential homes as well as government buildings and military installations destroyed. The photographer added in his notes: 'Found almost every famous building [in Berlin] a shambles. In the center of town GIs could walk for blocks and see no living thing, hear nothing but the stillness of death, smell nothing but the stench of death.' Russian and German troops fought for control of Berlin in the spring of 1945 - six years after the start of the war in 1939. By . that point, Hitler's grip on Europe had almost entirely slipped and it . was evident the Allies would go on to win the conflict.

"A 'giant rat' measuring 4ft from nose to tail has been caught and killed by a pensioner with a lump of wood on his farm. Brian Watson, 67, from Waskerley, Consett in County Durham, was made aware of the monster's presence after his granddaughter's boyfriend cried out while mowing the grass. Mr Watson said: 'I heard him shouting there was a large rat. I came running round the corner. I managed to grab some wood on the way.' Scroll down for video . Death threats: Brian Watson, 67, from Waskerley in County Durham has been targeted by animal rights activists after this picture of him holding a 'giant rat' he had killed emerged last month . The creature was so heavy that Mr Watson broke a paddle when trying to scoop it up . 'It wasn't very fast. I managed to kill it there and then. I've never seen a rat as big in my life before.' One reason it was quite slow is that it might have been pregnant. 'I think it was due to drop young 'uns,' Mr Watson added. Some observers believe the creature was a coypu - a large South American rodent, also known as a river rat or swamp beaver, which is bred for its fur. Farmer: The pensioner later incinerated the creature's body after word of the monster spread . Some believe the animal was in fact a coypu, a South American rodent bred for its fur . After killing it, the grandfather tried to scoop it up with a paddle - but it was so heavy that the paddle broke. The . incident first came to light when Mr Watson's friend, Bri Mitchell, . posted a picture of the rodent after it had been caught, on Twitter. Mr Watson said: 'We left it for a few days, but word got round so we decided to destroy it and we chucked it on the fire and got rid of it that way.' The RSPCA is seeking further information on the incident from members of the public. A spokesman for the charity said: 'We would urge anyone with more information about this incident to contact our cruelty line and we will look into it further.' Durham Police said today that they are not currently investigating the killing of the animal.","Brian Watson, 67, picked it up with paddle which broke as 'rat' was so heavy ."
"If you are looking for that perfect Valentine's Day present then one of these could be just the ticket - if you want to make your other half run for the hills, that is. These gruesome teddy bears, called the 'Undead Teds', have been selling like hot cakes in the run up to February 14th. So many people have placed orders for a £59 Valentine's Day teddy ripping its bleeding heart out that their British creator, artist Phillip Blackman, says he has sold out. Don't worry, he's armless: Spooky teds look like they have been mauled by zombies . Romantic? This £59 Valentine's model featuring a bear that has ripped its heart out of its chest has sold out . Mr Blackman, who lives with his fiancée and two-year-old son in the Suffolk countryside, describes his gory creations as 'repurposed soft toys transformed into fluffy, bloody horrors to keep you awake at night'. The 45-year-old makes the zombie teddy bears by transforming old toys using film-standard special effects make-up. He said: 'I hit . on the idea of making zombie teddy-bears - the inspiration came from a . rather obscure in-joke between my partner and I. 'Zombified to order': Phillip Blackman also makes bespoke teddies, customising clients' bears as they wish . Some bears have worse injuries than others - these two appear to have suffered particularly badly . 'She had a terrible cold at the time and we'd been talking about a gift for a friend's baby. With a very stuffy nose ""teddy-bear"" kept coming out as ""deady-bear"", and we joked about zombie teddies that creep from under your bed at night to feast on your brains while you sleep.' Mr Blackman initially tried sewing bones and organs out of felt, but felt his sewing skills weren't up to it. Having long been a fan of film director George A Romero, creator of zombie film Night of the Living Dead, and with training in theatrical and special effects make-up, he decided to use the same techniques on teddies. He bought some old bears on eBay, but when his partner became pregnant and they moved house, the artist forgot all about the teddy bears in the chaos of a new family. But when he was sorting through his son's soft toys deciding what to take to the charity shop, he came across the old bears he'd bought and decided to have a go at transforming them. He said: 'I individually hand-sculpt the bones, teeth and other organs from polymer clay or latex, then open the bear's carcass, scoop out as necessary and glue the bones into place.' Realistic: Mr Blackman uses his training in theatrical special effects to achieve the entirely realistic gore . Possibly for those with harder stomachs than most: These teddies by Phillip Blackman have both sold . Some designs, including the Valentine Undead Ted, have a strong wire frame retrofitted to ensure they keep their pose and don't fall over. 'The bones, teeth and other organs are individually hand-sculpted from polymer clay or latex, the bear's carcass is then opened, scooped out as necessary and the bones glued in place. Mr Blackman then paints the bears and adds a wet-look varnish to blood and bones for extra realism. He said: 'Each UndeadTed takes in excess of eight hours to make, not including the time it takes for glue, paint and varnish to dry, and I price them individually depending on size, complexity, materials used and time taken. For adults only: These customised teddies featuring horrific injuries have both been sold to unknown buyers . 'They've all been great fun to make but of all the ones I've made so far, my favourites are the Valentine ones, holding their torn-out hearts aloft as a grisly gift to their lovers. Horrible.' While the appeal of the gory bears may prove elusive to many of us, their appeal for others is obviously strong. Mr Blackman's online Etsy store has sold out, while his undeadteds.tumblr.org website has attracted comments from enthusiastic fans, all of them female. One woman asks if he ships to the US, adding: 'I am dying to get one of your amazing creations', while another exclaims: 'These are perfect for Valentine's Day!' Mr Blackman told Mail Online: 'Most of those who are interested in the bears are 20-somethings, both men and women, and lots of people have been buying them as Valentine's presents. 'The demand is astonishing - as soon as I make them, they're gone.  I put up three new bears on my website this week and they were all sold within 90 seconds.' Fans of the bears can also send in their own teddies and specific injuries, and Mr Blackman will customise them according to their requests.

"More than 600 students at the University of Derby have been put at risk of infection with HIV and hepatitis . Six hundred students have been put at risk of HIV and hepatitis because a healthcare worker failed to followed correct clinical procedures. Past and present students at the University of Derby - who had either vaccinations or blood tests - have been advised to attend screenings for the infections to ensure they have not been infected. The advice was given after an investigation was opened into the safety of procedures carried out by a member of staff who was formerly contracted to provide services within the Occupational Health Service at the university. Experts at NHS England have said the actions of a healthcare worker put students at risk of HIV and hepatitis B and C. The worker involved failed to change the syringe barrels which needles are attached to between each patient. This oversight occurred over a period of eight years putting 606 students at risk. The affected patients are those that were seen by the healthcare worker between September 2005 and October 2013. Dr Doug Black, Medical Director, NHS England Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire said: ‘This investigation has taken place as it is understood that, whilst syringe needles were always changed between patients, the syringe barrels to which the needles attach were being reused in the administration of vaccinations. ‘This also occurred during blood taking, where a single use holder for a blood collection tube was reused but needles changed. ‘Therefore, there is an extremely low possibility these errors may have put people at risk of infection from hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV. ‘With this in mind, as a precaution, we have reviewed all available university health records and the 606 people identified have all been contacted and invited to attend a blood test at their local hospital or via their GP.’ He added: ‘We are extremely sorry for the undoubted worry and concern people we are contacting may feel on receiving this news. ‘I would however like to stress that the risk is extremely low and would encourage all those we contact, who may not already have been screened after their time at the university, to present themselves for blood testing. The patients were put at risk by a healthcare worker who failed to change syringe barrels between patients. Image shows HIV infection in human tissue . ‘As part of our investigation the healthcare worker involved has been reported to the appropriate regulatory body and has been suspended, pending further investigation. ‘We are working closely with the University of Derby and Public Health England to resolve this issue as quickly as possible.’ Professor John Coyne, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Derby said: ‘This is a deeply regrettable incident, and it does mean that we need to contact a significant number of our current and former students to ensure they get the information and guidance they need. I apologise for the potential distress this may cause to the people involved. The risk is thought to be extremely low because the needles attached to the syringe barrels were changed between patients. Image shows hepatitis B . ‘We are working closely with NHS England and Public Health England to provide support and assistance to those people who may be affected by this issue, and will continue to do so tirelessly in the coming weeks to ensure that all appropriate support is available and provided. ‘An advice line has been set up by the university, with clinical support from Public Health England, to provide advice and guidance to callers. ‘Those who receive a letter are advised to call 03330 142479 for further information on what actions they should take next.’ The investigation is being carried out by NHS England, Public Health England and the University of Derby.","606 students from the University of Derby have been contacted .

"Once the pride and glory of American shipbuilding, the SS United States has been rusting away in Philadelphia for nearly half a century – but now the historic vessel may get a new lease on life. SS United States is getting a below-the-deck makeover to make it more appealing for developers interested in turning what was once the world's fastest ocean liner into a massive dockside attraction. Workers began a project in October to remove tanks and other materials from the belly of the ship to make way for modern utilities systems that would need to go in to transform it. America's flagship: Workers began a project in October to transform SS United States into a massive dockside attraction . Sad tale; The nonprofit group that owns the long-retired ship warns that the historic vessel could be sold as scrap . There is a second objective to the project, which is expected to last well into 2014: selling the materials to raise the $50,000 to $60,000 it takes each month to maintain and insure the vessel. The SS United States Conservancy, the nonprofit group that owns the ship, warns that if its grand plans do not come together quickly, there might be no choice but to sell the historic liner as scrap. ‘It's a great fixer-upper,’ said Susan Gibbs, executive director of the SS United States Conservancy and the granddaughter of William Francis Gibbs, the ship's Philadelphia-born designer, on a tour of the ship. SS United States is 990 feet long – over 100 feet longer than RMS Titanic. No wood had been used in its construction or fittings - except for a special fireproof Steinway piano. The vessel was designed to be just wide enough (101 feet) so it could pass through the locks of the Panama Canal with two feet of clearance on either side. On her maiden voyage, the SS United States shattered the trans-Atlantic speed record in both directions. Everyone from Marylin Monroe to Salvador Dali, Judy Garland and President John F. Kennedy crossed the Atlantic aboard the storied vessel. How to use the ship – five city blocks long and a monument to shimmery aluminum and the sleek lines of mid-20th-century Modernism - has been a conundrum for more than 40 years. Belly of the beast: The engine room of the SS United States, which still holds the record for speediest trans-Atlantic voyage . Failed plan: The ship was partially funded by the Navy with the idea that it could be converted one day into an extremely efficient troop transporter, but the plan never came to fruition . Fall from grace: This first class cabin area of the SS United States was at one time swarming with political luminaries and Hollywood stars like Marlon Brando and Merilyn Monroe . Eyesore: The liner has been oxidizing in a pier across the street from a shopping center in Philadelphia . The SS United States was launched in 1952 as the world's fastest ocean liner, and it still holds the record for speediest trans-Atlantic voyage. The ship was partially funded by the U.S. Navy with the idea that it could be converted one day into an extremely efficient troop transporter. But it was never called to service by the government. And by 1969, after carrying four presidents, Prince Rainier of Monaco, Elizabeth Taylor and a million other people across the Atlantic, it was retired from its regular duties. Glory days: SS United States was the winner of the Blue Riband for 1952 with a transatlantic crossing speed of 41 mph . Infamous boat: SS United States is over 100 feet longer than RMS Titanic, which sank in 1912 . Seaworthy: The ocean liner is pictured during its launch at the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company yard, Virginia, June 21, 1952 (right) Familiar face: Popular film and TV star Bob Hope is shown handing in his ticket before boarding SS United States in 1955 for a three-month visit in Europe . The hulking ship has been berthed on the Delaware River in Philadelphia since 1996, its once-bold red, white and blue paint faded and its iron oxidizing in a pier across the street from a shopping center. Over the years, plans to make the SS United States into a cruise ship have failed, partly because it was designed for speed, not slow-moving recreation, and is narrower than modern cruise ships. The conservancy used a $5.8million gift from a Philadelphia philanthropist in 2010 to buy the ship. The group's vision is different from . others that came before. It wants to turn it into a multiuse attraction, . perhaps with restaurants, a hotel and banquet facilities, along with a . maritime history museum.

"It's not every day you see a celebrity lying prone in a towel with their face covered in gold. But it's not every day that a celebrity is offered a facial with a £1,000 price tag. Lucky Lisa Snowdon, the face beneath the precious metal, is the latest recipient of the ultra-luxe Gold Bee Venom facial, performed at The May Fair Hotel in London. The star tweeted a rather arresting photograph of herself mid-treatment, reclined on the spa bed with the glittering gold mask covering her face. Golden girl: Lisa Snowdon tweeted this picture of herself undergoing the NOTOX 24 carat facial at the May Fair hotel . The mask, which gave her more than a . passing resemblance to an Egyptian Mummy, is part of the process of . Rodial's gold and bee venom facial - a new and ultra-luxe treatment that . uses real gold to encourage radiance and vitality in the skin. Said to be a 'complete . skin rejuvenation treatment to smooth, ""freeze"", lift, plump and . brighten the complexion', the treatment, which launches this week, uses a . bee venom cream by cult beauty product firm Rodial, available at . Harrods for £380, that has been described as nature's alternative to Botox. The . gold facial is said by its creators to be able to tackle a 'multitude of . complexion complaints' including lines and wrinkles, loss of elasticity, . hyper-pigmentation, a dull or sallow complexion, irritation and . inflammation. Trendsetter: Lisa tweeted the pic with the hashtag Golden Lady . Glowing: Lisa Snowdon as she looks normally . The facial . treatment - dubbed a 'sensual healing ritual' - uses Rodial's Bee Venom 24 . carat gold super essence along with the pure gold. Rodial's Hana Kelly, who developed the treatment, says it is unique in the market because it combines the ancient healing properties of gold with the most up-to-date skincare technology. 'Gold has been used in skincare and healing for centuries,' she says. 'Cleopatra slept with gold on her face and ancient Ayurvedic treatments have always used gold.' Hana, who is trained in Ayurvedic treatments herself, explains that the skin is first smoothed and resurfaced with micro-dermabrasion . before pure oxygen at 21 per cent (any higher creates free radicals) is blasted onto the skin to push the formula of the serum deep into the skin’s epidermis. Fan: Ellie Goulding is fond of Rodial's £380 Bee Venom 24 carat gold super essence, which is the cream that is used in the treatment . The face is covered with a layer of . real 24 carat gold leaf layered with a mask made of 24 carat gold, hyaluronic acid . and collagen. The gold dissolves into the skin when you massage it . in using a signature technique that stimulates individual . muscle groups. Light therapy is used to soothe, calm and rejuvenate skin tissue while stimulating collagen production. While the gold facial works its magic, a massage is performed with . Rodial's 24 carat gold body cream, designed to 'tighten and brighten tired, dull, sagging skin'. The face feels 'lifted' afterwards, says Hana. 'People often say their face feels frozen, like they've had Botox.' Lisa . Snowdon, who would have been given a shot of gold, collagen, hyaluronic acid and vitamin C to . 'refresh and vitalise the palate' afterwards, certainly enjoyed it, tweeting afterwards that the treatment . was 'gorgeous', along with the hashtag #GoldenLady. 'We wanted to offer the most luxurious facial in the UK,' says Hana. 'It's available at The May Fair, or I will go to people's homes with everything we need to carry out the treatment. We always give a gift of the serum [the £380 bee venom) at the end so that the client can go on experiencing the radiance once the facial is over - the Colloidal gold in the serum will carry on giving radiance if it's used continually. 'This isn't the sort of facial you have once a month and have a course of ten. This is your red carpet facial - you are having it that day and you're going to look fantastic,' she says. 'It's about giving that luxury experience, healing but also making you look gorgeous.'","Gold facial is UK's most expensive .

"The 28-year-old is modelling high street store's collection of occasionwear . Model's grandmother is the late Swedish film star Ingrid Bergman . It's no wonder Elettra Wiedemann has supermodel looks. Her mother is the model and actress Isabella Rossellini, her grandmother the beautiful Swedish film star Ingrid Bergman. And now, Elettra has lent her excellent genes to high street store Coast, who have just signed the model as the face of their new spring/summer collection. The model showcases the store's new collection of occasionwear, which will be sold in the brand's new flagship store, set to open on London's Oxford Street on 28 June. Elettra Rossellini Weidemann wearing Antoinetta top, £70, and Azelia skirt, £110, both Coast .

Coast said they had selected the model thanks not only to her natural radiance, but also for her 'impeccable' pedigree. 'Her natural, timeless beauty and radiance aligns perfectly with the contemporary glamour of Coast,' they said. 'We chose Elettra for her flawless style and impeccable fashion lineage.' Indeed, Elettra has seen her career go from strength to strength since landing her first modelling job at the age of 18, for youth clothing brand Abercrombie & Fitch. She has since appeared in ads for Bill Blass, Ferragamo and Samsonite, and walked the runway at global fashion week shows. Dress, £275, sizes 6-16; Hair clips, £18 each; Bracelets, £40 each (available from flagship store only from June), and Sandals, £75, sizes 4-8, all Coast . And since 2006 she has been a spokesmodel for Lancome, appearing in a number of their advertising campaigns. Like many of her contemporaries, Elettra has graced the pages of Vogue and Harper's Bazaar - but she has talents that lie far beyond her ability to look good in a frock. Thanks to her Italian heritage, Elettra has a passion for food, and each New York fashion week opens up a pop-up restaurant called GOODNESS at the city's Columbus Center where she feeds up her peers and fashion industry folk during the week's events. The food is conjured up courtesy of the Big Apple's celebrity chefs including Mario Batali, Julian Medina, and Alain Allegretti, who all take a night each. And in addition to coordinating the social calendar for the city's fashionistas, she also finds time to dedicate herself to good causes too, with environmental issues particularly close to her heart.

"Scandinavia is the world's most well-travelled region, according to a new study, with Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Norway all in the top five countries. The average Finn takes 7.5 trips a year, topping the list compiled by Trimetic. The United States, coming in second, is the only non-Nordic country in the top five, with Americans travelling an average of 6.7 times per year. Finland and the US are followed by Sweden (average six trips per year), Denmark (5.3), and Norway (5.2). Well-travelled: The Finns travel more than any other country in the world, according to a new study . The United Kingdom ranks behind Australia, Canada, France and Germany, coming 13th on the list. The average Briton takes 0.9 international trips and two domestic trips per year. The reasons for the Scandinavian enthusiasm for travel is due to a wealthier population and a wish to escape the harsh winter, according to Trimetic.

New Zealand (tie) 8. Canada . 9. Australia . 10. France . 'People in Scandinavia can afford more trips due to high incomes and relatively low unemployment rates,' says Arnie van Groesen, travel and tourism analyst at Timetic. 'Cost of living is relatively expensive in Scandinavian countries, meaning that if they go abroad they’ll often get more value for money. The weather conditions make them attracted to less severe conditions in the southern part of the world, such as the Spanish beaches.' One in six Scandinavian families also own holiday homes they regularly travel to, the study reports. Norwegians take an average of two international trips per year, the highest number in Europe. Despite being the second best-travelled country in the world, most Americans do not travel internationally. The US dominated the domestic tourism market, and only one in five Americans travelled abroad in 2013, and less than half own a passport. Domestic holidays: While the US placed second, only 1 in 5 Americans travelled abroad in 2013 . Tourists: Hong Kong, New Zealand, Canada, Australia and France are in the top 10 most well-travelled countries . Trimetic has put this down to far less paid holiday time for American workers than for those in Europe, making extended vacations more difficult, and therefore shorter breaks to closer destinations attractive. Hong Kong ties with New Zealand for sixth position on the list, with almost all of those trips international. Domestic travel in Hong Kong is non-existent, with the average resident taking 4.3 trips per year - 74 per cent of those to China. In collating the data, Trimetic used only overnight trips taken in 2013, with any mode of transport (air, land, water, rail) included.","Scandinavia take 4 of the top 5 spots for the best-travelled countries .

"Mother-of-four Nicola Mendelsohn, 41, who is known for her insistence on working a four-day week, will take up the key Facebook post in July . She is the new poster girl for working mothers who insist it really is possible to 'have it all'. Nicola Mendelsohn has just landed one of the biggest media roles in the world – but is likely to work only a four-day week so that she can spend more time with her husband and four children aged between eight and 16. The 41-year-old British advertising executive has just been made Facebook's new vice-president for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Although it has not been confirmed officially that she will be working a four-day week, industry insiders expect her to do so since this is a condition she has insisted on in the past. Mrs Mendelsohn, who has forged a successful 15-year career working part-time, begins her role at the social media giant in July. The Manchester-born executive – who calls herself 'a proper Northern lass' – will oversee a team of nearly 1,000, including around 150 in Facebook's Covent Garden office. Mrs Mendelsohn married her husband Jon, 46, a lobbyist and former Labour party fundraiser, in 1994 and lives in a £1.3million house in Finchley, North London. She is known and admired throughout the business community for her ability to rise to the top while also making time for her young family. Her belief is that working from Monday to Thursday improves her work-life balance. The appointment offers hope to women who feel torn between their careers and their families. Mrs Mendelsohn said recently: 'The industry has to more readily welcome back its best women. I would much rather hire a talented woman on four days a week than lose her forever.' Her promotion will please Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, a passionate advocate of women in the workplace. She recently published a book, Lean .

"From eating acidic foods to choosing certain sexual positions, couples desperate for a baby girl will turn to any old wives’ tale for help. But now, one man claims he has developed an app which can help couples conceive the daughter they desire. Alain Hanash, a software developer, says his app draws on dietary science to increase a woman’s chance of having a baby girl. Software developer Alain Hanash has created an app - called StorkDiet/Girl - which he says can increase a woman's chance of conceiving a girl. He says it gives advice based on dietary science . He says the app ‘is a natural, safe and scientific method to assist would-be mothers in choosing their baby's gender’. The StorkDiet/Girl app, which costs £6.99, is based on new research from the University of Oxford and the University of Exeter, Medical Daily reports. The study by experts at the universities revealed that there is a link between a mother-to-be’s diet and the gender of her baby. It showed that women who eat less salt and more calcium, as well as fewer calories in total, are more likely to have a girl. The researchers looked at 740 women and discovered that about 56 per cent of those who followed a low-salt and high-calcium diet had a baby girl. Based on this, Mr Hanash’s app encourages women who want to conceive a girl to eat a diet rich in foods that will improve their chances – specifically those that are low-calorie and low in salt and high in calcium. Mr Hanash, who is from Washington, says that if women follow the advice given by the app they can have an 81 per cent chance of conceiving a baby girl . This diet is based on a database of some 8,400 products which is stored on the app. The app also helps women work out which time of the month they should have sex to give themselves the best chance of conceiving a girl. According to Mr Hanash, who is from Washington, women who stick to the diet and advice on timing sex have an 81 per cent chance of conceiving a girl. The app is available on both iPhones and Android.","Software developer Alain Hanash has created the StorkDiet/Girl app .

"Darrin Simpson, pictured was using a metal detector when he discovered the silver coins . A rare silver coin has fetched £78,000 at auction – because it could be a clue to a 1,200-year-old murder. It was struck in the reign of East Anglian ruler Aethelberht II and describes him as king – the only time this title has been found on a coin of his. His ambition may explain his beheading in 794 on the orders of Offa, the more powerful king of Mercia. Darrin Simpson, who found the coin in a Sussex field in March using a metal detector, will split the sale price with the farmer who owns the land. 'It’s fantastic, an amazing result. I am really quite shocked,’ said the 48-year-old. The . Anglo-Saxon coin went under the hammer on Wednesday at London . auctioneers Dix Noonan Webb with a guide price of only £20,000. A spokesman said: ‘This coin could easily have been destroyed by a plough or a digger or just a shovel. ‘We . don’t know when it went into that field but it was probably well before . the Battle of Hastings. It’s miraculous that it has survived.’ The rare Anglo Saxon silver coin, pictured was sold for £72,000 after an auction exceeding its guide price due to its possible link to a 1,200 year murder . A . spokesman for international coin and medal specialists Dix Noonan Webb . said 'This find by Darrin changes our knowledge of Anglo Saxon coinage. 'Saxon coins weren’t just used for day-to-day transactions, they were a way for rulers to project their image. 'If Offa thought Aethelberht was getting too big for his boots, that might be why he was so brutally murdered.' According to legend, Aethelberht’s severed head later fell off a cart and rolled into a ditch. After . the bloodied head was found, it was said to have restored a blind man’s . sight, resulting in the dead king being declared a saint.","Darrin Simpson found the 1,200 coin while sheltering from a heavy storm .

"Devastating: Evidence has surfaced that Churchill ordered chemical weapons to be dropped on Russia . He is feted as a national hero, but new evidence has come to light that Winston Churchill once ordered 50,000 of the most devastating chemical weapons ever made to be dropped on Russia. In two months at the end of the First World War, Churchill authorised the M Device - shells with chemical tips - to be dropped over villages and military posts held by the revolutionary Bolsheviks in northern Russia. Then secretary of state for war, Churchill had wanted the British Government to support the White Army in its civil bitter fight for power with the Bolshevik Red Army, according to Giles Milton author of Russian Roulette. Mr Milton told The Telegraph Churchill had wanted to 'really go hard against the Bolsheviks, who had seized power from Tsar Nicholas II in 1917. He said: 'The British had developed this highly secret chemical weapon called the M Device, which is like a shell with a canister of gas on the end. 'It was developed at Porton laboratories in Wiltshire and described by the head of munitions as the most devastating chemical weapon ever devised. It had been invented but not used. 'Churchill’s idea was to use the M Device against the Russian Bolsheviks. Fifty-thousand . were taken up in planes and then dropped on the Bolshevik Red Army . positions and Bolshevik controlled villages in northern Russia between . August and September 1918.' Although Churchill had wanted to help the White Army, the Government refused to take sides. Mr Milton, 47, has also revealed Churchill wanted to use chemical weapons against rebellious tribes in North India. He added: 'What I found really shocking was when he wrote this internal memo to the India Office, along the lines of ‘we should use it against the tribes on the North West front. They’re really troublesome, let’s gas them.' 'There’s a line in the memo that says ""I really don’t understand this squeamishness about poison gas"". Today that reads pretty badly.' Cabinet minister: When Churchill ordered the chemical weapons to be dropped on the Bolsheviks, he was secretary of state for war. Pictured here at Enfield munitions factory in 1915 . Bloody: Bolshevik soldiers take aim at their rival Mensheviks during the struggle for power in 1917 . Minority: In 1917 the Bolsheviks were in the minority, but that did not stop them seizing power and ordering the assassination of Tsar Nicholas II and his family . Mr Milton explained he was researching material for his new book when he discovered a document in the National Archives that had been written by British scientists, who had been sent to Russia to record the effects of the M Device. Shortly after breathing it in, victims started vomiting blood. They then fell unconscious. Mr Milton said the British tried to 'play it down' by claiming fatalities were limited. But Russian evidence tells an altogether different story, with one soldier claiming 50 of his comrades were killed. Revolutionary zeal: This image from about 1900 shows Vladimir Ilych Lenin addressing a crowd. Stalin, Trotsky and Kamenev stand behind him . Support: Churchill wanted to support the White Army against the Bolsheviks. Pictured, the North Russia Intervention saw the allies invade land at Archangel and drive the Bolsheviks back . Despite their fearsome reputation, the M Device did not prove as devastating as Churchill had hoped and thousands of the shells were dumped in the White Sea on the north-west coast of Russia because they were too unstable to fly home. Asked what effect the latest revelation could have Churchill's image, Mr Milton said: 'He’s a great Briton but there are other sides to his character. He was advocating the mass use of chemical weapons.' Mr Milton's new book, Russian Roulette, is the true account of British spies who were sent to Russia to undermine Lenin's plot to bring down British India. Lenin: Churchill was vehemently against the Bolsheviks and described their leader as a 'bacillus' The Bolsheviks finally seized power in October 1917 following a five-month struggle. Tsar Nicholas II had been toppled during a coup in March, but it was not until later that year that the Bolsheviks finally managed to solidify their grip. From the outset they were locked in a bitter struggle for power in the Russian parliament, known as the Duma, principally with the liberal Mensheviks. Bolshevik leader Vladimir Ilych Lenin was living in exile in Switzerland when the first revolution took place. He struck a deal with the Germans - who were still officially at war with the Russians - that he be allowed to travel on a 'sealed train' from Switzerland, through Germany, and onto Finland, where he crossed the border into Russia. Churchill later said of the journey: 'They transported Lenin in a sealed truck like a plague bacillus from Switzerland into Russia.' The Bolsheviks could count on the support of the navy, which proved key in their bid to take power and in October 1917 the Bolsheviks overthrew the provisional government and appointed party members to key posts. A bloody civil war ensued between the counterrevolutionary White Army and the Bolshevik Red Army that was to drag on four nearly four years. But by 1922 the Bolsheviks finally defeated the White Army and in 1922 the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic (USSR) was declared. After a lifetime of fighting to bring about the revolution in Russia, Lenin died in 1924 leaving behind him a power vacuum that would lead to the inauguration of Joseph Stalin in 1928, one of the most brutal dictators the world has ever seen.","Churchill ordered 50,000 chemical shells to be dropped on Russians .

"Most ATMs serve the purpose of fattening our wallets but a new take on the facility looks set to fatten our waistlines instead. Popular LA bakery Sprinkles, which launched a cupcake ATM Stateside, is bringing the device to the UK so that shoppers can get a sugary fix at all hours of the day. The Beverly Hills company, which is said to be considering a number of different locations in London to install the machine, churned out up to 1,000 cupcakes a day when it opened the same facility in Los Angeles - and even reported that the machine crashed because of high demand. Scroll down for video . Sugar fix: Popular LA bakery Sprinkles is launching a cupcake ATM in London so that fans can indulge 24 hours a day . Ready for launch: The pink ATM is already installed beside the Sprinkles outpost in Beverly Hills . The ATM would be continuously restocked throughout the day and night with a choice of . eight cupcake flavours at any one time, priced at around £3.50 each. Nicole Schwartz, head of marketing at Sprinkles, explained that the machines can hold up to 600 cupcakes, and any cake dispensed will have only been baked a couple of hours earlier. She told The Atlantica t the time of the LA launch: 'The machine is attached to our bakery, . which is essentially a 24-hour operation. By the time our closers leave . at night, it’s 11pm and our bakers arrive in the wee hours of the . morning (2 or 3am!). Famous fans: Sprinkles is a favourite with the A-list including Heidi Klum (pictured at a store in 2008, left), Blake Lively (centre) and Khloe Kardashian (right) 'We’ll constantly be restocking the automat with . freshly baked cupcakes so the cupcake you receive will only have been . baked a couple hours earlier. Whether the London machine will stock cakes for dogs too, like its LA counterpart is as yet unconfirmed. Sprinkles in LA decided to stock the pet treats because health department regulations do not permit dogs in the bakery she explained, 'so you don’t have to tie up Fido while you head . inside.' Sprinkles is as famous in its American birthplace for its A-list fans as it is its buttercream-frosted treats. Popular: Sprinkles, which has outposts in LA, Newport Beach, Washington DC, Dallas and New York, is as famous for its A-list fans as it is its buttercream-frosted treats . Heidi Klum, Blake Lively and the . Kardashian sisters have all been spotted in its stores (though quite how . they eat cupcakes and maintain those bodies is anyone's guess). And since The Great British Bakeoff hit screens, cupcakes are certainly in fashion on this side of the pond too. Cakes, in flavours such as cinnamon . sugar and chocolate coconut, sell for $3.50 each (£2.15) or $39 per dozen (£24) in the States, and prices are likely to be similar when the cakes launch in the UK. So prepare those waistlines because it is only a matter of time before cupcake ATMs hit the UK. Ulrika Jonsson, pictured, has been trained by Jenny Dawes. Personal trainer and nutrition expert Jenny Dawes, who has worked with the likes of Ulrika Jonsson, right, gives her opinion…. 'We should have treats occasionally. Making 'treats' so easy to access in 24 ATM machines may possibly end up 'eating' away at a persons willpower. 'In one breath we are hearing the message  to  cut down on fats, sugars and to eat a healthy diet. 'he visual message in launching a 'marketed' ATM machine that sells what I can only describe as devil food is not helping people maintain their healthy lifestyle. 'We all know that too much fat in our diet can lead to heart disease and some cancers. 'The danger with sugar is similar which, long term can contribute to diabetes, weight gain and also increased visits to the dentist with teeth cavities. 'It is difficult to put precise figures on the nutritional value of cup cakes without knowing the brand as they can vary quite dramatically. 'I would say the average cup cake has around 200 to 300 calories adding a further 100 -150 calories for frosting and fillings. 'A fat content of around 15 -20 grams with sugar levels around the same- not good news for our health or our weight. 'We all should have treats but I do believe the temptation with these 'marketed' 24 hour ATM machines will tempt and encourage an unhealthy approach to eating habits.","Cult LA baker Sprinkles launched the dispenser in the U.S. earlier this year and is now bringing the device to Britain .

"An impatient commuter probably regretted  telling a man to 'f*** himself' on a busy train when he arrived at a job interview later that day to find his fellow passenger was the head of recruitment. HR executive Matt Buckland claimed the job seeker pushed past him and launched a foul-mouthed tirade as they were both getting off a packed rush-hour train on Monday morning. He said he stood to one side to let a woman off the train as it pulled into Monument Station in central London, but the job hunter thought he was deliberately standing in the way. Hours later, the same man walked in for an interview with Mr Buckland at investment firm Forward Partners. HR executive Matt Buckland found himself interviewing the same man who launched a foul-mouthed tirade at him earlier the same day . 'I was on my way into work on the Tube on Monday morning during rush hour. I stood to one side to let a lady get by, and ended up blocking a man momentarily. 'I think he thought I was just standing in his way. He pushed and I turned, I explained I was getting off too but he pushed past and then looked back and suggested I might like to f*** myself…which might have been true but not before a few cups of coffee,' he told Buzzfeed. Despite the heated exchange, the job seeker did not recognise his interviewer as soon as he arrived. So Mr Buckland asked him a few tube-related questions until the penny dropped. He then shared the awkward encounter on Twitter and his original tweet has been favourited 14,000 times and re-tweeted more than 15,000 times. 'Karma - the guy who pushed past me on the tube and then suggested I go F myself just arrived for his interview...with me..' he tweeted.

'I think it crept up on him slowly as my questions became more and more tube related.' The job seeker 'laughed it off' and carried on with the interview for the role of web developer at the firm. But he was not offered the job as Mr Buckland said he was not right for the role. 'It would be easy to hold something like this over someone in an interview, but for me interviews aren't about that,' said Mr Buckland.

"The German newspaper, Süddeutsche Zeitung, has been accused of anti-Semitism after it published a cartoon depicting Mark Zuckerberg as an octopus controlling the world. The cartoon was published in the newspaper last Friday after the announcement that Facebook had purchased Whatsapp. Two versions were published, one with the caption ‘Krake Zuckerberg’, the other ‘Krake Facebook’ – Facebook Octopus and Zuckerberg Octopus. In the drawing, the 29-year-old Facebook founder is portrayed with a hooked nose, fleshy lips and curly hair, features ascribed to Jewish people in Nazi cartoons. Zuckerberg Octopus: The cartoon was published in Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper last week and has led to accusations of anti-Semitism . The cartoon was ‘starkly reminiscent’ of anti-Semitic Nazi era cartoons, Efraim Zuroff from the Simon Wiesenthal Centre told the Jerusalem Post. ‘[I]f anyone has any doubts about the anti-Semitic dimension of the cartoon, we can point to Mark Zuckerberg’s very prominent nose, which is not the case in real life,’ said Mr Zuroff who added that he found the cartoon, 'Absolutely disgusting!' The cartoon depicts Mr Zuckerberg, who was raised Jewish but now describes himself as an atheist, as an octopus grasping at computers around him. In one of his tentacles he holds the logo of Whatsapp, the instant messaging service his company recently purchased for $19billion. Jews were commonly depicted as octopuses, spiders, vampires and devils in Nazi-era propaganda, such as this poster from 1938 . ‘The nefarious Jew/octopus was a caricature deployed by Nazis. That was used pretty much as a staple by the Nazis in terms of their hateful campaign against the Jews in the 1930s. [An] exaggerated Jewish nose removes any question if this was unconscious anti-Semitism,’ Rabbi Abraham Cooper, Associate Dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre told Algemeiner. ‘Mark Zuckerberg is fair game for the media, including German media, but no German should deploy such caricatures,’ he said. The cartoonist, Burkhard Mohr, apologised for the offence his cartoon caused in an email to the Jerusalem Post on Monday. ‘Anti-Semitism and racism are ideologies which are totally foreign to me,’ he wrote. ‘It is the last thing I would do, to defame people because of their nationality, religious view or origin.’ The newspaper took to Twitter on Monday to address the issue, writing simply: ‘We apologise for the cartoon.’ Mr Mohr released an updated version of the cartoon this week, replacing Zuckerberg’s face with a blank rectangular hole. The Suddeutsche Zeitung came under fire for publishing a cartoon that seemed to depict the State of Israel as a ravenous monster. The cartoonist Burkhard Mohr apologised for the offence he caused and released an updated version of the cartoon without Mark Zuckerberg's face . The cartoon as it originally appeared in the newspaper last Friday. It bears the caption 'Krake Zuckerberg', or Zuckerberg Octopus . Cartoonists have often used the image of an octopus to portray a global power taking over the world, such as this poster showing fear at the reach of the U.S. and this cartoon from 1994 depicting Microsoft's expansion . The image dates back a long way, this cartoon depicting the colonial reach of England was published in America in 1888 .

"Gordon Brown was heckled by angry an Scottish nationalist today after returning to front line politics to rescue Alistair Darling’s flailing campaign against independence. The former Prime Minster was labelled ‘an absolute disgrace’ by pro-independence supporter Mike Barile after delivering his rallying call for the Union . Mr Barile, a Labour supporter who was struck off as a teacher for assaulting two pupils, shouted ‘rubbish’ before he was removed from the Dundee meeting half way through the Labour MP’s address. Scroll down for video . Scottish nationalist Mike Barile heckled the former Prime Minister Gordon Brown today as he spoke at a Better Together rally in Dundee . Mr Barile, who allegedly gave a false name to gain entry to Mr Brown's speech, called the former Prime Minister 'an absolute disgrace' Mr Barile said he became infuriated after Mr Brown praised Mr Darling’s leadership over the last few weeks. He said: 'As a Labour voter, I was disgusted at the message they were sending.' Today's rally, which came just days after Monday’s dramatic TV debate over independence, saw Mr Brown and Mr Darling put aside their differences to share the stage in support of the union. Mr Darling, leader of the pro-UK Better Together campaign, served as chancellor when Mr Brown was in charge at 10 Downing Street. Mr Brown allegedly tried to replace the Better Together leader with Ed Balls during the financial crisis – while Mr Darling has admitted considering joining a plot to get rid of the Prime Minister. Mr Brown today insisted it was a ‘pleasure to sit alongside Alistair Darling’ who he praised for leading the Better Together campaign. He said: ‘For the last two years [he] has done the incredibly difficult job, which we must now thank him for, of bringing together all the parties under the banner of Better Together.’ Mr Brown today claimed Scottish independence would only benefit the rich – because of the promised business tax breaks offered by Mr Salmond. Better together leader Alistair Darling and former Prime Minister Gordon Brown put aside their differences to attend this morning's Better Together rally . The former PM said the biggest winners from independence would be wealthy business bosses . Mr Brown told the audience that while the nationalists ‘dine out’ on ideas of equality, they have ‘no plans to raise funds that would come from a fairer taxation system’. ‘They dine out on Scottish ideas of equality - they talk as if they actually believe it,’ he said. ‘But when you look at the actual policies of the SNP, there is not one measure in their document that suggests there would be a higher rate of income tax for those at the very top, or a millionaire's tax at the top of council tax, or a mansion tax at the top of stamp duty, or even the bankers' bonus tax that is proposed for the UK. ‘They have no way of raising the money to pay for all the expensive promises they have made.’ Mr Brown returned to front line politics today after his former Chancellor Mr Darling was mauled by Mr Salmond on Monday . Mr Brown said SNP proposals to cut corporation tax would benefit large companies, including energy firms. ‘The biggest beneficiaries of the SNP's tax policy are the shareholders and directors of the privatised energy companies in Scotland,’ he said. ‘The beneficiaries of an independent Scotland are not the ordinary people of Scotland but the richest directors of the most profitable, privatised companies in Scotland. ‘When you look at the Scottish National Party policies, inequality and poverty will survive until doomsday if Alex Salmond is all that confronts it.’","Mr Brown labelled 'an absolute disgrace' by pro-independence supporter .

"The daughter of Casey Kasem has written a scathing open letter slamming her step-mom’s bizarre decision to bury her father in Norway. Kerri Kasem said she wants to ‘set the record straight’ about where her dad wanted to be buried and pleads with Norwegian government officials: ‘Do not be fooled into believing his wife, Jean Kasem.’ In the heart-felt letter, addressed to 'whom it may concern', Kerri wrote: ‘As beautiful as your country is, our father has never spoken of any desire to be buried in Norway either to us or to his friends. In fact, it was the opposite. Scroll down for video . Ongoing conflict: Casey Kasem's children and friends claim that he always wanted to be buried in California, rather than Norway as his second wife Jean is seeking to do. Jean and Casey are pictured in 2004 at the Beverly Hills Hotel in California . ‘Casey wanted to be buried in his hometown of Los Angeles, California, his home of over 53 years. ‘Do not be fooled into believing his wife, Jean Kasem, who abandoned and isolated him during the last year of his life.’ Kerri insists Jean is ‘not by any means of Norwegian descent’ and claims Jean’s grandmother is not Norwegian as the statuesque blonde claimed. ‘In fact, here is a quote from Jean's nephew Herbert ""Tommy"" Thompson who was named after Jean’s father, ""As far as we know, we are English, German and Native American. We have never ever heard anyone speak of Norway or Norwegian for that matter in our house. We don't have an ounce of Norwegian blood to our knowledge,'"" Kerri wrote. Kerri says she believes the ‘representations’ Jean made in a letter to the Norwegian government have been ‘perpetuated by not only Jean, but her daughter Liberty because of the ongoing investigation from local authorities of criminal elder abuse.’ Casey Kasem's daughter Kerri, right, has written a scathing open letter slamming her step-mom Jean’s bizarre decision to bury her father in Norway . She added: ‘We beg you, to please decline the request of Jean Kasem and her daughter Liberty to bury Casey Kasem in Norway.’ The heartfelt letter is signed by Kerri, her sister Julie and brother Mike and Casey’s brother Mouner, as well as several other members of the Kasem family and several of Casey’s close friends. Accompanying Kerri’s letter shown exclusively to MailOnline was a letter from Casey’s best friend former Lt. Governor of California Mike Curb. Casey asked Mike in 2010 to be buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery in Burbank, California, because he foresaw something like this happening with Jean, according to Kerri’s publicist Danny Deraney. ‘Mike back in 2010, offered to pay for the funeral and told Casey he would do everything in his power to make sure that happened,’ he said. In Mike’s letter to ‘whom it may concern’ he writes: 'I've been Casey Kasem’s best friend for close to 50 years and Casey always wanted to be buried in California.' Jean Kasem’s plans to bury her husband in Norway, were first confirmed by her publicist last week. She had already made arrangements for her husband's body to be flown to Oslo, the publicist said, after claiming that she has Norwegian heritage. Family and friends of the late radio star vowed to fight the plan and Casey’s daughter Kerri intended to contact the Norwegian government expressing her dismay at the situation. Embarrassingly for the statuesque blonde, one of her nephews revealed how his aunt did not have ‘an ounce’ of Norwegian blood in her. Kasem, host of American Top 40 and the voice of Scooby-Doo, died on June 15 at a hospital in Gig Harbor, Washington . Tommy Thompson, the son of one of Jean’s siblings, said: ‘As far as we know, we are English, German and Native American. ‘We have never ever heard anyone speak of Norway or [speak] Norwegian for that matter in our house. ‘We don't have an ounce of Norwegian blood to our knowledge.’ Casey's family are now working with L.A. private investigator Logan Clarke but have few legal options to prevent the overseas burial, the family’s publicist Danny Deraney said as Jean is the conservator of Casey’s body. Mr Deraney said last week: ‘As you may have seen, Jean Kasem is planning to attempt to bury Casey Kasem in Oslo, Norway. She sent an open letter to the Norwegian government declaring among other things, her Norwegian ancestry.‘ . The children, the family and friends want Casey Kasem to be buried in the place he requested, Forest Lawn in Glendale. Not to a foreign country he has never visited.’ Kasem, host of American Top 40 and the voice of Scooby-Doo, died on June 15 at a hospital in Gig Harbor, Washington. He was 82 and suffering from dementia and other health problems. His death followed a lengthy battle over his care between Jean, who was married to him for 34 years, and his three adult children from his first marriage. The Norwegian newspaper VG reported that Kasem will be buried in Oslo but it was not known when the burial may occur. 'It's been arranged, he's going to Oslo,' Wenche Madsen Eriksson, the head of the funeral service administration in Oslo, told the newspaper. Casey’s body is currently believed to be in Montreal, Canada, after it was apparently shipped there on July 14 - a month after his death - by Jean against the wishes of most of his family.

"International outrage over Israel's bombardment of Gaza continued to grow today as the world reeled from news that a third deadly attack on a UN school sheltering fleeing Palestinians killed ten yesterday, including children. The . U.S. State Department was first to condemn the bombing, on the compound in the southern town of Rafah that was sheltering 3,000 Palestinian refugees, as 'appalling' and 'disgraceful' as it pleaded with Israel to take more care to avoid . civilian casualties. Hours later, David Cameron joined the chorus of disapproval with his own message to Tel Aviv in which he backed UN chief Ban Ki-moon's condemnation of the attack as . 'a moral outrage', but stopped short of agreeing that it was a 'criminal act'. But the starkest condemnation of Israeli actions came from allies, France, whose foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, branded the 'killing of children and slaughter of civilians' as unjustifiable. Scroll down for video . Panic: A Palestinian man carries an injured child following the Israeli military strike on a UN school in Rafah that killed ten, including children, and wounded more than 30 . 'Slaughter of civilians': Witnesses to Sunday's attack said a missile that looked like a rocket struck an area just outside the gates of the Rafah Preparatory A Boys School where children were queuing to buy sweets and biscuits from stalls. 'How . many more deaths will it take to stop what must be called the carnage . in Gaza?' Fabius said in a statement. 'The tradition of friendship . between Israel and France is an old one and Israel's right to security . is total, but this right does not justify the killing of children and . the slaughter of civilians.' France is closely allied with Israel, and Fabius' statement was a rare direct criticism. The Gaza war, now in its fourth week, has killed more than 1,800 Palestinians and more than 60 Israelis. He added: 'This is why we need a political . solution, of which the components are known, and which I believe should . be imposed by the international community, because the two parties - . despite countless efforts - have unfortunately shown themselves . incapable of completing talks.' It came as a spokeswoman for David Cameron said . Britain is reviewing all arms export licences to Israel in response to . the Jewish state's escalating conflict with Hamas in Gaza. Chorus of condemnation: U.S. State Department spokesman Jen Psaki (right) said America was 'appalled' by the latest bombing, while David Cameron . backed UN chief Ban Ki-Moon's condemnation of it . as 'a moral outrage and a criminal act' 'Stop the slaughter': But the starkest condemnation of Israel's actions in Gaza came from France, whose foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, branded the 'killing of children and slaughter of civilians' as unjustifiable . According . to a report by a British parliamentary committee last month, . outstanding government-approved contracts for export of dual use or . military goods to Israel are worth more than £7.8billion . These . include contracts to supply body armour, drone components, and missile . parts. 'Clearly . the current situation has changed compared to when some licences will . have been granted, and we're reviewing those existing licences against . the current situation but no decisions have been taken beyond going back . again and reviewing,' the spokeswoman said. Earlier, the British Prime Minister said he supported UN Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon's condemnation of the attack in Rafah as . 'a moral outrage and a criminal act'. He said: 'I think the UN is right to speak out . in the way that it has, because international law is very clear that . there must not be the targeting of civilians or the targeting of schools . if that is what has happened. The UN as the international body is right to speak out in the way it has.' Pressed . on whether he regarded the attack as a 'criminal act', Mr Cameron . replied: 'The UN has spoken very clearly and I think they are right to . speak very clearly... 'I'm not an international lawyer, so that's up . to international lawyers. But international law is very, very clear that . the use of force always has to be proportionate and civilians should . not be targeted.' Mr Cameron said the Government had been 'very clear . that there needs to be an immediate comprehensive humanitarian . ceasefire, that we want this conflict to stop'. 'We obviously do . think it is appalling the loss of life that there has been,' he said. 'From the start, though, we have also made the point that if the Hamas . rocket attacks on Israel stop then that would be probably the fastest . way to stop this conflict.' Refugees: The school had been providing shelter to more than 3,000 people whose homes have been destroyed by fighting . Mr Cameron's comments echoed those of State . Department spokesperson Jen Psaki, who last night said: 'The United . States is appalled by today’s disgraceful shelling outside an UNRWA . school in Rafah sheltering some 3,000 displaced persons,' said State . Department spokesperson Jen Psaki, in a statement issued on Sunday. 'The . coordinates of the school, like all UN facilities in Gaza, have been . repeatedly communicated to the Israeli Defense Forces. We once again . stress that Israel must do more to meet its own standards and avoid . civilian casualties.' She called for a 'full and prompt' investigation . of the incident. Witnesses . to Sunday's attack said a missile that looked like a rocket struck an . area just outside the gates of the Rafah Preparatory A Boys School where . children were queuing to buy sweets and biscuits from stalls. Inside . the U.N. school's compound, several bodies, among them children, were . strewn across the ground in puddles of blood. 'Our trust and our fate . are only in the hands of God!' one woman cried. Ceasefire: The global community rallied in condemnation of Israel's attacks as Israel announced a seven-hour truce which was meant to open a 'humanitarian window' for aid . Why? The attack came days after a girl's school - sheltering 3,000 refugees - in Jabaliya was destroyed when a barrage of Israeli missiles rained down on it on Wednesday . Robert . Turner, director of operations for the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency . in Gaza, said the building had been providing shelter for some 3,000 . people - the same number that had been seeking refuge at a girl's school . in Jabaliya last Wednesday when it too came under attack from a barrage . of Israeli missiles. Israeli intelligence spied on US Secretary of State John Kerry during failed peace talks with Palestinians and Arab states last year, it has been claimed. As well as Israel, at least one other intelligence service listened to Mr Kerry's telephone calls during a key period of negotiations in 2013, according to the German magazine Der Spiegel. The revelations come as relations between the US and Israel remain tense and amid criticism of Mr Kerry's diplomatic efforts in recent weeks. Neither Washington nor Jerusalem has commented on the claims in the magazine, which says its information came from 'reliable sources'. Mr Kerry had been speaking regularly with 'high-ranking negotiating partners' in the Middle East at the time of the alleged eavesdropping - and some of them were intercepted, according to the report. A number of the calls were allegedly made on normal telephones - rather than encrypted equipment – and would have been transmitted by satellite. 'The government in Jerusalem then used the information obtained in international negotiations aiming to reach a diplomatic solution in the Middle East,' it added. He said the strike killed at least one U.N. staffer. 'The . locations of all these installations have been passed to the Israeli . military multiple times,' Turner said. 'They know where these shelters . are. How this continues to happen, I have no idea.' The . Israeli army - which says it has launched an investigation into the . attack - claimed it had targeted three members of Islamic Jihad on a . motorbike, contradicting witnesses who said no such vehicle was in the . area when the bomb fell. Israel . launched its military operation in Gaza on July 8 in response to weeks . of heavy rocket fire, carrying out hundreds of airstrikes across the . crowded seaside territory. It then sent in ground forces July 17 in what . it said was a mission to destroy the tunnels used by Hamas to carry out . attacks. Hamas has . fired more than 3,000 rockets into Israel during what has turned into . the bloodiest round of fighting ever between the two enemies. The . Israeli military said early Monday it would hold fire for a seven-hour . 'humanitarian window' beginning at 10 a.m. (0700 GMT), saying the truce . would not apply to areas where troops were still operating. The military . said it would respond to any attacks during that time. While . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to press on against . Hamas, he is coming under international pressure to halt the fighting . because of the heavy civilian death toll. U.N. officials say more than three-quarters of the dead have been civilians, . including the 10 people killed yesterday at the U.N. school in Rafah. In . the current round of fighting, U.N. shelters have been struck by fire . seven times. UNRWA, the U.N. agency that assists Palestinian refugees, . says Israel has been the source of fire in all instances. But it also . has said it found caches of rockets in vacant UNRWA schools three times.

"Jesus has been named the most significant person in human history, followed by Napoleon and Shakespeare, as ruled by the internet. Based on the impact on opinions certain individuals have had over time, and how that has reflected onto their Wikipedia pages, two computer scientists have come up with the ultimate list. Professor Steven Skiena and Charles Ward use quantative analysis to rank more than a thousand historical figures and prominent people, from Elvis to Beethoven, Stalin and Queen Victoria. Not Kayne West: The number one most significant person in human history is Christian prophet Jesus . With Jesus as a front runner it comes as no great surprise that the prophet Muhammad is ranked at number four. Leaders of empires are prominent on the list with Napoleon as number second and Alexander the Great at number nine.

"The father of Miley Cyrus's homeless VMAs date said it was 'heart-breaking' to discover his son was sleeping rough in Hollywood - but said he's baffled why the 22-year-old never reached out for help. Former Pepsi Cola executive Dennis Helt – whose son Jesse appeared on stage on Sunday at the VMAs to accept an award for superstar Miley - said he hasn't seen Jesse for three years. Dennis, 61, was stunned when his son's faced flashed up on TV and on the internet. Scroll down for video . Upset: Dennis Helt, Jesse's father, told MailOnline that he didn't know his son was homeless and last saw him three years ago. He added: 'If I'd known then maybe I could have helped him' Happier days: Jesse, far right, pictured at the Oregon State Fair with his four siblings when he was younger . Acting up: Jesse, left, put on a funny face for the photo. Right, he is seen returning to Oregon on Monday night . But the retiree says he was more shocked to learn his son was homeless and living under a bush while seeking the assistance of a charity to survive. 'We kept in touch since he left for LA but I haven't spoken to him this year,' said Dennis. 'I thought he was still chasing his dream, I didn't know he was homeless, he didn't share that information with me. 'If I'd known then maybe I could have helped him. It's heart-breaking knowing he was going through that when he’s got a family to fall back on'. Dennis spoke as police in Oregon were still looking for Jesse to arrest him for a breach of his probation conditions in 2011. Officers paid his mom's house a visit on Tuesday to serve out an arrest warrant – but Linda Helt said her son wasn't home. Jesse was on the run from police when he went to Los Angeles after breaking probation following a drugs test back in 2011, which was part of his probation for a criminal trespass offence he was found guilty of a year earlier. A judge in his home state of Oregon issued a warrant for his arrest for repeatedly violating the terms of his probation. As of Wednesday morning officers from Polk County Sheriff's Department had still not heard from Jesse. Dad Dennis believes Jessie was a 'normal' kid, but admits he knew nothing of his son's brushes with the law as a teenager. 'That's all new to me', he said. 'He was 19 when he left, but I don't know what he was getting up to.' Dennis said Jesse, the youngest of five children, was just a young boy when he separated from wife Linda. He said he has always had a good relationship with his son and they haven't 'burned any bridges' with each other. Dennis said he sent money to Jesse a 'couple of times' in LA and even offered to pay for his flight home whenever he wanted. Shock: Polk County police visit the home of Jesse's mother, Linda, on Tuesday to arrest him over an outstanding warrant for probation violations in his home town . Search: Linda Helt told officers that he wasn't at her house and asked if they could make an appointment to speak to the police and his probation officer . But Jesse chose not to reach out and ask for help when things became desperate, instead he slept on the streets and live off charity hand-outs. Dennis can't understand his son's decision and insists there was never any family fall out that forced Jesse to leave and said he's close to all his siblings. 'It just wasn't the case that Jesse came from a bad situation, yes his parents were separated but he had a good strong family unit and is close to all his siblings. He could have stayed here or stayed with his mom Linda, but he chose to go his own way. 'Since he moved away he's been doing it on his own. I did know he had been struggling for money but I thought he was just doing small jobs, you know cleaning or spinning a sign on the corner, while he was trying to get jobs as a model.' Cyrus hit out on Twitter on Tuesday after it was revealed that Jesse was a wanted man. In one the Wrecking Ball singer wrote: 'People who are homeless have lived very hard lives. Jesse included.' She also tweeted that she hoped Jesse's case 'can be the start of a national conversation about youth homelessness and how to end it' and added: 'Does looking down upon the homeless help people excuse their inaction'. Jesse was arrested in October 2010 after he tried to break into a flat where he said a man had sold 'bad marijuana' to him. He was charged with burglary, criminal mischief in the third degree and criminal trespass in the 1st degree. The burglary charge was later dismissed. On November 23 of the same year, he was given 30 days in county jail, placed on supervised probation for 12 months and fined $572 and ordered to pay restitution, according to Polk County Circuit Court. Focus: Miley Cyrus took to Twitter (above and below) to defend Jesse after his criminal past emerged . In mugshots obtained by MailOnline, Jesse was booked on probation violations on July 24, 2011 and August 22, 2011. And in February 2012, Helt made the Most Wanted List for Polk County. He was listed number two on the list wanted for first degree trespass. For dad Dennis – who worked for Pepsi Cola as an events manager for 32 years – it's still unclear why Jesse fled Oregon. He says that far from leaving a hard life behind Jesse is simply 'stubborn', adding that it took 'guts' to head for the lights of Hollywood on his own. 'Maybe he gets that from me, I always wanted to make everything on my own,' he said. 'I was proud of him for having the guts to chase after what he wanted. 'He went down there with a phone card and I've sent him money a couple of times to help him out and given his mother Christmas and birthday presents for him, but other than that he's a private individual, he went off radar. 'It's kind of got me by surprise, but I'm happy he's back, I hope I get to see him soon.' He proudly showed off a framed photo of Jesse and his four siblings taken around ten years ago at the Oregon State Fair. Jesse pulls a funny face in the black and white snap in which he and his brothers and sister are wearing old-fashioned clothing. Dennis now hopes he can reconnect with Jesse and help him sort his life out. 'I was as shocked as anybody when I saw the Miley Cyrus blurb on the internet. I've been trying to come to grips with it, but it's great for him, I would have loved to be blown up all over the media when I was his age. 'I’m looking forward to seeing him, I've called my family and the people close to me and we're looking forward to seeing him, I've not seen him for three years. 'Whatever Jessie's made on his own, whatever he's done whether that be to come out of homelessness and be up there on the stage, I'm happy for him and I hope it leads to a lot of good things in the future.' Heartfelt: Jesse, who went to LA to try and become a model, collecting Miley's VMA award on Sunday night. He stole the show with his speech on the plight of the 1.6m homeless youth in the city . Wanted: Jesse was found guilty of criminal trespass in 2010 (left) but then went on to be booked for violating his probation on numerous occasions before leaving his hometown for good (right) Meanwhile, Martin Silbernagel, Polk County Director of Community Corrections, said Jesse could face up to one year in jail for breaching supervision conditions. Speaking outside his office in Dallas, Oregon, Mr Silbernagel told MailOnline: 'We will continue to look for Mr Helt and we will find him eventually. If he wants to continue living his life looking over his shoulder making sure law enforcement isn’t behind him, that’s up to him. 'But eventually what goes around comes around and we will find him.' The official said that ultimately Helt will be brought to stand before a judge. He said: 'The judge at that time will determine whether or not Mr Helt will be continued on probation in the community or whether to revoke his probation and impose a custody sentence of up to one year in county jail.' The director insisted that 'all violations' are 'serious', however small or however big. 'I use the example of growing up, parents might say to Johnny, ""you need to clean your room, you need to clean your room""', he said. 'Eventually Johnny cleans his room, but if Johnny doesn't clean it there’s a consequence. Breaking the law in Polk County is the same, if you break the law there will be consequences'.","Jesse Helt's father, Dennis, told MailOnline he was shocked to see his son at the VMAs and discover what a desperate situation he was in .

"Edward VIII thought he might have been able to prevent the Second World War if he had not abdicated as King, according to a letter he wrote which has just come to light. The unique document also reveals the controversial ex-monarch's thoughts about Winston Churchill, who he thought showed 'brilliant leadership' during the War but was a poor 'peace time politician'. The former King had controversial links with Adolf Hitler, whom he visited in 1937, and is thought to have had fascist sympathies. In a letter to outspoken Right-wing author Gerald Hamilton, Edward - who was by this time the 75-year-old Duke of Windsor - questioned whether Britain could have avoided war if he had still been on the throne. Revelation: Edward VIII, left, detailed his thoughts about Winston Churchill, right, in a 1970 letter . Note: In this letter to Gerald Hamilton, Edward suggested he might have stopped the Second World War . The note was written in January 1970 from the home in Paris which the Duke shared with his wife Wallis Simpson, to thank Hamilton for sending the couple a copy of his latest book for Christmas. 'Whether or not I could have prevented World War II, had I remained King, is an imponderable,' Edward wrote. 'At least I used any influence I had to warn against the folly of another hollocaust [sic].' The Duke and Duchess were warned against visiting Hitler in 1937, but they ignored official advice and paid a trip to the Fuhrer's country retreat. Hitler believed that Britain would not have declared war on Germany if Edward had remained King, and there have been rumours that he planned to depose George VI and reinstate his brother on the throne of a fascist Britain. The former King told a friend years after the war that he 'never thought Hitler was such a bad chap', while he and Wallis are widely believed to have been sympathetic to the fascist cause. Controversy: Edward, the Duke of Windsor, and his wife Wallis meeting Adolf Hitler in Germany in 1937 . Hamilton, to whom he wrote in 1970, had . even more extreme views, and was interned by the British government . during both World Wars. Edward used the letter to describe how . he had 'clashed' with Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin during his short . reign, which began and ended in 1936. 'Where I clashed with Baldwin and his cronies was that I was not really of the Establishment which I was supposed to be,' he said. 'That aroused their suspicions that I would not always ""yes"" them, which indeed I would not have!' He added: 'Your diagnosis of Winston Churchill is perfect. Great orator and writer, yes, and imbued with insatiable ambition. No outstanding peace time politician; only war seemed to inspire him to brilliant leadership.' Churchill was a strong supporter of Edward during the abdication crisis, urging him to stay on the throne and helping to draft his resignation speech. Clashes: Edward failed to get on with Stanley Baldwin, right, because he frequently disagreed with him . The letter from the Duke to Hamilton . is being sold this week by Nottingham-based International Autograph . Auctions on behalf of a private collector, and is predicted to fetch . £8,000. Hugo Vickers, . an expert on the Royal Family, said: 'Gerald Hamilton was quite a . controversial character and one that the Duke of Windsor would have . loved to have been involved with. 'The idea that the Duke was an anti-establishment figure was one he liked to bandy about, especially in his later years, as we can see in this letter. 'The line about whether he could have prevented war breaking out is an interesting one. In 1937 Edward went to Germany to see Hitler on the advice of someone high up in the U.S. embassy in London. 'Edward honestly thought he could talk Hitler out of war which was pretty stupid but he felt that he had given it his best shot. 'It is a fascinating letter as it shows the Duke rewriting history as he wanted it remembered.' Controversy: Edward abdicated the throne in order to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson . This is not the first letter to come to light this year written by Edward VIII, who took the throne after the death of his father George V and abdicated in favour of his brother George VI in order to marry Mrs Simpson, an American divorcee. In September, a letter typed by Edward emerged in which he complained that he had been ordered to stay away from London in the wake of his abdication. And last month, a note to his first lover Freda Dudley Ward went on sale, revealing his frustrations at having to miss a tryst with her in order to go to the opera with his family. Dear Mr Hamilton, . I have to apologise for the delay in thanking you . very much for your letter of December 15, 1969, and for sending me a . copy of your latest book The Way It Was With Me. Both The Duchess and . I have read it with great interest and some nostalgia and in special . appreciation of your favorable [sic] references to us in Chapter 12, . page 9. Whether or not I could have prevented World War II, had I . remained King, is an imponderable. At least I used any influence I had . to warn against the folly of another hollocaust [sic]. Where I clashed . with Baldwin and his cronies was that I was not really of the . Establishment which I was supposed to be. That aroused their suspicions . that I would not always ""yes"" them, which indeed I would not have! Your . diagnosis of Winston Churchill is perfect. Great orator and writer, . yes, and imbued with insatiable ambition. No outstanding peace time . politician; only war seemed to inspire him to brilliant leadership. He . was a man without fear, and as he once told me, he was never bored. Thanking you again for providing such enjoyable reading and with The Duchess and my best wishes for this New Year.

"A loud noise heard near the Los Angeles home of embattled 7th Heaven star Stephen Collins sparked a suicide scare Tuesday night, which turned out to be a false alarm. Officer Jane Kim, with the LAPD, told MailOnline that 'someone from the media' placed a 911 call at 6.45pm pacific time about what sounded like a single gunshot fired inside a house in the 5100 block of Chimineas Avenue in the LA suburb of Tarzana. Officers responded to the area and cordoned off the block to investigate the report. Scroll down for video . False alarm: Police arrive at a house where Stephen Collins was believed to be staying in Tarzana, California, in response to a false report of a gunshot . Knee-jerk reaction: A member of the media who was outside the residence contacted police after hearing a loud noise that sounded like a shot . Neighbor tweets: Collins' neighbor, former Baywatch star and Playboy model Donna D'Errico, tweeted just after 8pm pacific time that the actor shot himself . D'Errico shared a photo showing police cars and emergency vehicles behind a yellow crime scene tape . Collins' neighbor, former Baywatch star and Playboy model Donna D'Errico, tweeted just after 8pm pacific time that the actor had shot himself. 'That's all I know,' she wrote in a follow-up tweet. 'The police have the street cordoned off and aren't even letting residents in..' She then shared a photo showing police cars and emergency vehicles behind a yellow crime scene tape. A short time later, the gossip site TMZ reported that Collins was not home and did not take his life. Sources directly connected to the actor told TMZ he has been communicating with them all night. Temporary arrangement: The house is a rental properrty where Collins has been staying . Suburbia: A street sign for the 5100 block of Chimineas Avenue in Tarzana . According to NBC News, LAPD made contact with Collins via Facetime to make sure he was alive and well. D’Errico later deleted the tweet about Collins' suicide and apologized for repeating what her neighbors had told her. In bombshell divorce documents obtained by MailOnline on Tuesday, Collins' wife, Faye Grant, claimed the actor used his celebrity status to prey on underage girls and ‘engender the trust of the families of the children he molested’ in a decade of abuse. Devastated Faye also revealed Collins was treated for a sex addiction and was seeing a ‘sexual dysfunction’ therapist, but he refused to seek proper help or hospitalization for his ‘predilection towards children’, she said. An empty ambulance is seen parked outside a residence in the 5100 block of of Chimineas Avenue . All clear: Collins was not home Tuesday night when police descended on the Tarzana house . Sources close to Collins said the actor has been communicating with them all night . In bombshell divorce documents obtained by MailOnline, Faye Grant claims her husband Stephen used his celebrity status to prey on underage girls and ‘engender the trust of the families of the children he molested’ in a decade of abuse . The actor who played Pastor Eric Camden, the virtuous father on long-running family drama 7th Heaven, is allegedly under investigation for child molestation. In the court filings Faye said she first learned of Collins' 'illness' in the presence of his therapist in January, 2012 – after 27 years of marriage. And according to the papers she spent 20 months coping with the trauma of his alleged abuse on children and worrying about her 'moral and legal responsibility'. She said: 'Obviously I am sickened by Stephen's actions. I have urged Stephen multiple times to seek proper treatment for pedophilia. 'I am particularly afraid of what may happen if he does not seek treatment, because he may be working or interacting with children in connection with his employment.' Tapes of Collins' confession given during a marriage therapy session emerged in the past 24 hours. In the court filings Faye said she first learned of Stephen Collins' 'illness' in the presence of his therapist in January, 2012 – after 27 years of marriage . In the tapes, obtained by TMZ, Collins admits that he exposed himself to several young girls between the ages of 11 and 13. The NYPD is now reportedly investigating the claims Collins had 'inappropriate sexual contact' with 'at least three' minor victims. The 67-year-old actor allegedly made a written confession to his now ex-wife Faye Grant in 2012, which sparked the therapy session. Grant secretly recorded the session under the advisement of her lawyer, who told her it was legal in California to record conversations in order to gather evidence on a person who has committed a violent felony. In the recording, a man with Collins' distinct voice admits exposing himself to an 11-year-old relative of his first wife Marjorie Weinman. Collins and Weinman divorced in 1978. He also confessed to touching the young relative. 'There was one moment of touching where her hand...I put her her hand on my penis,' Collins says. Collins is best known for his role as Pastor Eric Camden, patriarch of the do-gooder Camden clan, on long-running drama 7th Heaven. Last month he tweeted this photo of a cast reunion dinner attended by his foremr co-star Jessica Biel, center . That incident of molestation was actually reported in 2012, and can still be prosecuted since the statute of limitations starts at the date of reporting. In the divorce documents Faye says Collins’ therapist subsequently disclosed to her that her husband has ‘narcissistic personality disorder with sociopathic tendencies. She said: ‘In the presence of his therapist, Stephen admitted that he has engaged in a long term pattern of sexually abusing minor children, including sexually molesting three young girls over a decade ago…I believe that there have been other victims, but he has thus far only confessed to those girls.’ Faye said that one of the victims Collins confessed to molesting lives in Los Angeles and the other two were in New York. She said: ‘The two New York victims were apparently molested over the course of several years, from the ages of 10 to 14 years old. Collins, pictured serving Thanksgiving Lunch in L.A. in 2012, allegedly made a written confession to his now ex-wife Faye Grant in 2012, which sparked the marriage therapy session . Papers: Both Collins and Grant listed their separation date as February 1, 2012 in their initial divorce filings back in May of 2012 (above) Bombshell: In November of 2013, Grant filed papers again since the divorce was taking too long to be finalized, where she revealed having learned of Collins' illness and asking that any legal liability Collins might have would not come out of her pocket . 'My understanding is that all three of these victims are now over the age of 26.’ She said it is her understanding that there is currently an open investigation with the New York City Special Victims Unit with respect to one of the victims who filed a sexual assault claim against Collins in November, 2012. ‘Again I had no knowledge of Stephen’s secret life until January 2012. I heard accounts of Stephen’s secret life from Stephen’s therapist, his sister-in-law, his sister-in-law’s husband, and Stephen himself.’ Faye says she never witnessed any of the abuse first hand and never suspected her husband was abusing children. She added: ‘After Stephen admitted to molesting the three young girls, I reported his acts to the police in both Los Angeles County and New York City.’ The couple were married for 27 years before Faye first learned that her husband had been 'engaging in a long term patterns of sexually molesting children', according to court documents. Collins starred alongside Whoopi Goldberg in the 1985 romantic comedy Jumpin' Jack Flash . In January 2012, Stephen admitted abusing three underage girls over a decade earlier - two of whom he molested over a period of several years. One victim filed a report with authorities in New York City. In December 2012, Faye received letters and a phone call from the furious husband of one of the victims, angry at Faye for not turning Stephen over to police. The husband threatened to bring a civil lawsuit against Faye for Stephen's actions. Faye has now taken legal action to ensure that Stephen is held solely liable for his crimes and pay compensation for the damage he has done to her. She said in her statement: 'I am also afraid of the potential consequences that Stephen's behavior may have for me, including risking my reputation and livelihood. 'I also fear that I may potentially face civil (or even criminal) liability for Stephen's actions.'","LAPD officers rushed to Tarzana, California, after getting a 911 call about a shot fired inside Stephen Collins' house .

"A musical director was thrown out of a First World War memorial concert for impersonating Hitler and making jokes about gas chambers in front of a German choir, according to sources. David Barclay, 41, allegedly joked about 'removing clothes and showering with' a group of German singers who took part in the Three Choirs Festival at Worcester Cathedral. He was forced to apologise over his remarks and now faces a disciplinary hearing over his future. David Barclay, 41, (centre) was dismissed from a WWI memorial concert for impersonating Hitler . He said: I'm very sorry for any offence I cause during the Three Choirs Festival. 'I completely understand why what happened was inappropriate. 'I have apologised to the festival organisers and to the Cathedral and would like to offer my heartfelt apologies to all those who were present.' Barclay specialises in renditions of German music, particularly Bach and Schuman, and has been principal cantoris tenor lay clerk at Worcester Cathedral since 2008. He allegedly made the offensive comments to members of the Chemnitz Opera during a rehearsal of 'A Foreign Field' by acclaimed German composer Torsten Rasch. The remarks were made during a rehearsal for the Three Choirs Festival at Worcester Cathedral (pictured) A row erupted over complaints the Chemnitz singers made about their English counterparts abilities to sing in German. Mr Barclay, who speaks German well, allegedly made comments about the German singers behaving like the Nazis. He then mocked them by pretending to be Hitler, according to inside sources. A spokesperson for the Three Choirs Festival said: 'We can confirm that a member of the Three Choirs Festival chorus was reported to have made offensive remarks during a rehearsal for one of our performances. 'On learning of the incident the Three Choirs Festival management team took immediate action and the person concerned was dismissed from the festival. 'He was also disciplined by the cathedral and has apologised for his inappropriate behaviour, which he deeply regrets. 'The Three Choirs Festival is proud of its collaborative international projects and long history of social action and condemns any form of racism.' The musicians had been invited to the festival, held between July 26 and August 2, as part of the ongoing commemoration of the outbreak of the First World War. Barclay specialises in renditions of German music, particularly Bach and Schuman, and has been principal cantoris tenor lay clerk at Worcester Cathedral since 2008 . A letter sent to the Worcester News said: 'David Barclay, who sings with the Cathedral Choir has been suspended for impersonating Hitler in front of our German visiting singers and talking of 'removing their clothes and showering them'. 'Witnessed by many of us, he was dismissed from the festival and faces a hearing regarding his future in the choir. 'Many things in the past are swept under the carpet, the Cathedral are happy to deal with this behind closed doors but we feel this should be made public.' Mr Barclay studied at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, London, under the Scottish tenor William McAlpine. A member of the Pershore Town Choir, where Barclay also leads, said: 'It is a very unfortunate incident and I think David may have misjudged his audience on this occasion. 'He is a real character but he is prone to making flippant comments. He would never say anything with malice and he is incredibly talented at what he does. 'What I have been told who was there was that the German delegation of singers were becoming bolshy about the performances. 'A comment was made about English singers, something about their poor grasp of the German sections of the piece. 'David, who speaks German very well, said something to the effect of the German singers behaving like the Nazis. 'I am told he mocked them by pretending to be Hitler. He was making a point about them not to be too critical of the English singers but it got out of hand.' The Very Reverend Peter Atkinson, Dean of Worcester, said: 'A member of the Three Choirs Festival chorus was dismissed from the festival after highly offensive remarks were reported. 'The person concerned has also been disciplined by the Cathedral. 'The Cathedral does not condone racism in any form, and deeply regrets the offence cause to those who witnessed it.' Torsten Rasch’s ‘A Foreign Field’ was a joint collaboration performed at Worcester Cathedral on July 31. Sally Cavender, of Faber Music who represents Mr Rasch, said: 'It is sad that this has happened. 'Unfortunately some people have a belligerent view of the German people but these comments are more like the kind of thing someone might say in a pub rather than a choir. 'A Foreign Field, which is written by a German about the First World War, can be difficult and is sung in German, English and Latin. 'It was well rehearsed and was very well received.' It was reported in an earlier version of the article that Mr Barclay was the current Director of Music at Pershore Abbey, but this is not the case as he left in 2008.","David Barclay, 41, allegedly mimicked Hitler and joked about gas chambers .

'We had the perfect family, well you know we thought we did and all of a sudden they (doctors) tell you there's something wrong, it's a pretty hard thing to take,' father Allan Donnell said upon hearing their second child, Jude, was diagnosed just a month after Isla was struck down with the disease. 'It's like we won some sort of reverse lottery or something,' Mrs Donnell said. Unknowingly, the pair were both carriers of the mutated gene which they passed onto their two children. Sanfilippo Syndrome causes developmental delay in children, usually younger than five, who have an inability to break down complex material in cells as part of the metabolism process. With nowhere to go, the material turns toxic and from the moment the child is born it builds up in the central nervous system. And because it is classed as 'ultra rare,' very few doctors know about it and even less pharmaceutical companies - zero - are willing to fund trials in children which have proven effective on mice. Isla Donnell, 5, was diagnosed with the severe condition, just a month before her three-year-old brother Jude . Jude provided hope for Mr and Mrs Donnell in fighting their daughter's disease, until he too was unfortunately struck down with the very same disease . The Donnell's are hoping that their two children are invited to participate in the drug trial, which begins in Ohio in December . But all that is about to change, courtesy of a band of parents including the Donnell's and an American family that have raised more than $1 million to begin trials in in young patients. The only problem is just 15 children will be granted access, meaning the Donnell's fear that they will be restricted to having one child at best participate in the trial. 'Fifteen places worldwide, we are realistic that it is unlikely that we would get two of those places,' Mrs Donnell said. 'There are lots of parents all around the world just like us with the same hope.' Through incredible fundraising means such as online crowd sourcing, and the work of the Donnell's Sanfilippo Children's Foundation set-up to raise crucial awareness about the condition, the trial will begin in December. It's participants, as yet, are not known. Head of biochemical genetics at Adelaide's Women's and Children's Hospital professor John Hopwood has dedicated 40 years of research to Sanfilippo Syndrome, having developed a gene replacement therapy that was successful on mice. Kevin Flanigan, left, is overseeing the trial of just 15 patients in the US and is following on the breakthrough work of researcher John Hopwood, right, who has discovered a drug against Sanfilippo Syndrome . Mrs Donnell is hoping her son Jude and daughter Isla will be included in the trial, saying it would be a 'miracle' if they are both on it . 'If you start early in a mouse, then you can prevent the condition from developing,' Mr Hopwood said. He is hoping, that when the trials go ahead in the US later this year, it can even reverse the condition and bring children back to normal health. 'That's the big question' he said, 'but the earlier you start the better chance you've got of slowing or reversing the condition in a very significant way.' The gene replacement therapy works by injecting a virus that delivers a healthy gene into the brain. If it works, as it did in mice, that a single injection will stop the disorder in its tracks and the children would become the first survivors of Sanfilippo Syndrome. Dr Kevin Flanigan who is overseeing the trials in Ohio must decide which 15 children in the world will get the most benefit from the drug trial. He said without the fundraising efforts of people like the Donnell's, there would be no chance of it going ahead. 'These parents have played a key role from fundraisers in the back yard or at school bake sales and have really paved the way for the progress that we've made.' Mrs Donnell said 'It would be a miracle' if her children were selected for the trial. 'I'm hoping that we will come back here (America), hoping that other Australian children will have the opportunity to come back here and I'm hoping work we are doing as a foundation will enable that. 'It feels so real now ... It's the only chance that we have, and we are chasing that with everything we have.'","Parents risk choosing one of two children to go on new drug trial .

"It has clocked up an astonishing 11billion miles in its 35-year journey. And now, to celebrate the cosmic anniversary, Nasa has re-released two historic images taken from the spacecraft Voyager 1 during its explorations of our solar system. The Voyager is about to bid farewell to the solar system, becoming the first man-made object to escape the heliosheath bubble that surrounds our solar system, and venture out into interstellar space. This tiny dot, amid a band of coloured rays, is our planet, as seen from staggering distance of 11,100,000,000 miles away, and pictured in 1990. This latest image taken by Voyager and released by Nasa shows the Earth as a dot in the solar system as the twin spacecraft explore the edge of our solar system . Poised to cross into interstellar space: This image, taken by the Voyager 1 spacecraft, shows a volcanic plume on the Jupiter Moon Io . The twin spacecraft of Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 - one of Man's earliest rockets - were launched in 1977 to explore the outer planets including Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Voyager 1 has reached the our solar system's final frontier and is poised to cross into interstellar space. The probe has also beamed back incredible images of the Jupiter Moon Io, showing a volcanic plume. Last month, Voyager 1 signalled it had passed two of the 'key changes' expected when it passes out of the furthest fringes of our solar system. Scroll down for video . The probe is still detecting 'spikes' in the intensity of cosmic ray electrons - which lead scientists to think it's still within the 'heliosheath', the very outer edge of our solar system. The Voyager probe has been travelling towards the outer reaches of the solar system since 1977 - it has enough batteries to last until 2020, scientists estimate . This is the furthest distance any . man-made object has ever travelled - and on July 28th, it's long and . arduous journey was broken by cosmic changes. The data received from the Voyager, which travels at ten miles a second, on July 28 showed a five per cent spike in the level of high-energy cosmic rays. This implies the Voyager is moving . out of the heliosheath - the 'protective bubble' around the solar system . created from charged particles from the sun. On the same day, the level of lower-energy particles coming from within the solar system dropped by half. However, over the next three days, . these levels returned to their previous amounts, giving NASA scientists a . small mystery to study while they await for more information. For the past year, Voyager 1 used its instruments to explore the new region. It appeared to be the cosmic doldrums where solar winds streaming out from the sun at 1 million mph have dramatically eased . Voyager is now detecting the first traces of 'interstellar winds' - the signs it is finally reaching the edges of solar system . The third indicator that the Voyager . is leaving the solar system is the direction of the magnetic field, and . this is now being studied by NASA. Once all signals have been passed, . NASA can confirm the Voyager is on to the final frontier, and they . expect to provide a preliminary report on the magnetic fields this month. Voyager project scientist Edward Stone . said: 'These are thrilling times for the Voyager team as we try to . understand the quickening pace of changes as Voyager 1 approaches the . edge of interstellar space. 'We are certainly in a new region at . the edge of the solar system where things are changing rapidly. But we . are not yet able to say that Voyager 1 has entered interstellar space.'

"Google has apologised after its mapping service renamed a road in Berlin after Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. The intersection, usually called Theodor-Heuss-Platz, temporarily regained its Nazi-era name - Adolf-Hitler-Platz. The area carried Hitler's name after he came to power in 1933 until the end of the Second World War. Mistake: An intersection in Berlin was accidentally renamed after the Nazi leader this week (pictured) Previously, it was known as Reichskanzlerplatz and in 1963 it was renamed after Theodor Heuss - the country's first president. Local media reported the mistake remained on Google Maps for a couple of hours. Google spokeswoman Lena Wagner said Friday the company quickly took down the name after the error was discovered. Google says it's not clear how the error occurred, but that 'we apologize for this mistake.' Scores of streets and squares were named after Hitler during his 1933-1945 dictatorship. The intersection in question, in western Berlin, sits on what the Nazis envisioned as the capital's main east-west axis for a redesign of the city that was never completed.

"Created: . 17:09 EST, 19 August 2014 . Sensitive: Nurses are visiting the elderly at home to see whether they would agree to a 'do not resuscitate' order as part of an NHS England questionnaire (file photo) Nurses are visiting the elderly at home to see whether they would agree to a ‘do not resuscitate’ order. They are asking patients they have never met sensitive medical questions, including what should happen if their health suddenly fails. A ‘do not resuscitate’ – DNR – order instructs doctors not to try to restart a heart that has stopped beating. The questionnaires are part of an NHS England scheme to improve care of the elderly and keep them out of hospital. It is not clear why DNR is on the forms. Medical experts fear vulnerable patients will feel pressured into giving their consent simply to avoid causing trouble. Peter Carter of the Royal College of Nursing said: ‘I have never heard of anything like it. These questions are usually only asked when the nurse has developed a good and meaningful relationship with the patient. ‘Only then will the nurse begin broaching these difficult subjects. ‘It is truly extraordinary within a few minutes of meeting someone to ask them where they want to die and to sign a form. Nurses shouldn’t be put in that position.’ Roy Lilley, a health policy analyst whose mother was visited by a nurse with the form, described the policy as callous. ‘Elderly, frail but otherwise healthy people are being asked, by complete strangers, to sign a form agreeing they shouldn’t be resuscitated,’ he said. ‘It is outrageous. People will be frightened to death thinking the district nurses know something they don’t and will feel obliged to sign the form so as not to be thought a nuisance. ‘This is a serious matter that ministers should be banning today. They are signing their lives away. ‘I would advise the relatives of anyone who gets this form to tell them not to sign it.’ The Daily Mail has highlighted concerns that the Health Service might have been hastening the deaths of elderly patients under the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway. Pressure: Medical experts fear vulnerable patients will feel pressured into giving their consent simply to avoid causing trouble (file photo) The practice, which involves gradual withdrawal of food and fluid to ease the final hours of patients and is intended to spare them suffering invasive treatment, is now being scrapped by hospitals.Doctors had raised concerns that the pathway might be being used to free up beds. The NHS England forms were sent out to GP practices in June, with district nurses visiting elderly patients ever since. They are targeting the over-75s and patients with long-term conditions that put them at risk of needing to go to hospital unexpectedly. Mr Lilley was at his mother’s home earlier this month when a district nurse she had never met arrived 45 minutes late for a scheduled appointment and started going through the form. Within a few minutes the nurse asked  his mother ‘Where would you like to die’,  and then, ‘If you ever need cardiopulmonary resuscitation do you agree to do  not resuscitate’. Mr Lilley – a former chairman of an NHS trust – said relatives of other elderly patients had contacted him to complain about the questionnaires. Critics: Health policy analyst Roy Lilley (left) said the question was callous, and Peter Carter of the Royal College of Nursing (right) said DNR is usually only brought up if nurse has a good relationship with a patient . Controversy: The Daily Mail has highlighted concerns over how the Health Service was hastening the deaths of elderly patients under the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway . Two of them said district nurses had asked the highly sensitive questions over the telephone. Roger Goss of Patient Concern, a campaign group, said: ‘It is completely inappropriate to ask a question like this out of the blue. ‘You normally only ask a question like that to someone who is terminally ill.’ The three-page forms – personalised care plans – ask patients to give their name, address, date of birth and details of any illnesses and medication. They then ask whether emergency treatment or care has been discussed and state ‘cardiopulmonary resuscitation – has the patient agreed a DNR?’ The forms also ask if the patient has drawn up an ‘anticipatory care plan’ – usually given to the terminally ill. This covers where they want to die and what drugs should be administered at the end of life. Video courtesy of Ohio Health . Last resort: A DNR order is meant to stop a patient suffering unnecessarily where their lives are likely to be extended for only a short period or if they are in great pain (file photo) Such sensitive topics are usually broached only with patients known to be nearing the end of their lives – and by nurses or doctors in whom they trust. A DNR order is meant to stop a patient suffering unnecessarily where their lives are likely to be extended for only a short period or if they are in great pain. Efforts to restart the heart through cardiopulmonary resuscitation are traumatic and often cause broken ribs and damage to organs such as the spleen. Doctors estimate that only 10 to 15 per cent of patients are brought back to life with resuscitation.But there have been tragic cases when relatives and patients have not been told or forms have been put in notes accidentally. These include that of 86-year-old Peter Clarke who died in hospital in Derby because a DNR form had mistakenly been placed in his notes and doctors did not try to resuscitate him. Of the DNR question, an NHS England spokesman said: ‘As the form says this question should only be used if appropriate. ‘Nurses should always use their discretion and compassion when dealing with patients especially on such sensitive issues.’ A Royal College of Nursing spokesperson said: 'Open conversations are crucial to ensuring that patients can choose how they would like to be cared for at the end of their lives, including whether they would like to be resuscitated should their health decline. 'Nursing skills and experience can make a sensitive conversation more comfortable for all involved, but the conversation needs to happen at the right time and in the right way. 'It should happen when it is relevant to the person concerned and when the patient has a trusting and familiar relationship with the nurse. It should not happen at a first meeting simply in order to complete a form.'","Patients asked via form if they would agree to a 'do not resuscitate order'

"A woman has been left paralysed from the waist down after contracting tonsillitis so severe that she was hospitalised on her 21st birthday. Samantha Siddell, 22, has spent months learning to walk again after she was diagnosed with a condition called transverse myelitis, thought to have been triggered by a virus. The rare reaction caused a severe inflammation of her spinal chord, and her nervous system was attacked - leaving her complete paralysed below the waist. Her condition was so severe that she collapsed and was hospitalised on her 21st birthday. She . said: 'I know a lot of people end up in hospital on their 21st . birthday, but usually it involves alcohol - I was stone cold sober, and . terrified. Samantha Siddell has been left paralysed from the waist down after contracting tonsillitis so severe that she was hospitalised on her 21st birthday . 'Two days later I was completely paralysed from the waist down - and it was all thanks to tonsillitis. I never would have thought something as routine as tonsillitis would have stopped me walking.' 'I had never had tonsillitis before in my life,' she said. 'I had been suffering with it for a few weeks, but when I collapsed I knew this was not an average case.' Miss Siddell, of Rotherham, was treated and discharged, but a week after leaving hospital, Miss Siddell started complaining of strange sensations in her hand. She said: 'It started in my hands - I couldn’t bend my fingers. 'It was a really hot summer and whenever I picked up a cold can in a shop I found it painful. It felt like electric currant shooting through my hand. 'I went to my doctor and they told me it was probably a trapped nerve and referred me to physiotherapist. The rare reaction caused a catastrophic inflammation of her spinal chord, and her nervous system was attacked . 'By the time I saw the physio the sensation had spread to my legs. The physio was shocked and said it was more serious than a trapped nerve.' The condition baffled experts - who at first diagnosed her with either kidney or liver failure, until tests for both came back negative. She was then referred to a neurologist as doctors thought the strange sensations could have been brought on by depression. She said: 'The neurologist saw a large inflammation on my spinal chord but nobody could tell me what it was.' Then on her 21st birthday, while she was enjoying a celebratory meal, her symptoms took a turn for the worse and she collapsed again. By the next day, she couldn’t feel anything below her waist. She said: 'At least when you have the weird sensations you can feel something. I couldn’t feel anything and it was unbelievably scary. 'It's like being on a plane and then suddenly you hear all the loud noises stop - the absence of noise is more terrifying.' It was only when she became paralysed that she was diagnosed with transverse myelitis - a rare neurological condition which consists of inflammation of the spinal cord. She has spent months learning to walk again after contracting a condition called transverse myelitis . The condition myelitis causes sensory loss in the upper or lower parts of the body and in rare cases can cause complete paralysis. It is caused when a patient’s immune system reacts abnormally and attacks tissues and organs in the body. Doctors said that in Miss Siddell’s case, the shock of her severe tonsillitis effectively reprogrammed her immune system to attack the tissue in her spine. Miss Siddell said: 'This mystery illness of mine which had been through every diagnosis under the sun had turned out to be this really unusual condition.' Miss Siddell was hospitalised for the next six months. Ever since then she has been confined to a wheelchair. She said: 'One in three people with my disease will get completely better and have no lasting symptoms. Transverse myelitis is a neurological condition that triggers inflammation of the spinal cord. It is thought to be caused by a virus experts remain unsure of the exact cause. It is very rare and affects just 300 Britons each year. Symptoms include weakness, 'heaviness' and numbness of the limbs. In severe cases this can lead to total paralysis. It may also cause someone to be more sensitive to touch, cold, and heat. There may also be tight and painful muscle contractions (known as tonic muscle spasms). The symptoms and signs depend upon the extent of the spinal cord affected. Around 70 per cent of sufferers will never recover but intensive physiotherapy can help reduce symptoms. 'Another one in three will have partial recovery and have partial mobility - but still suffer with symptoms. 'The final third don’t make any recovery at all.' Now approaching the two-year anniversary of her 21st birthday, Mrs Siddell has started to learn to walk again. She said: 'I can walk very small distances now - I’m trying to slowly build back up. 'At one point I was told I would never get back out of bed again. 'I went to a specialist rehabilitation place. First I worked on being able to sit up, because I couldn’t support myself at all. I was like a ragdoll I kept falling to the side all the time. 'Then I progressed to using a standing hoist. They put a belt round my waist and it takes my weight through my arms. 'Then I started walking while being supported by people. 'I can walk short distances by myself now, but it is very tiring for me to walk around so I have to use the chair out of the house nearly all the time. 'Walking for the first time in nearly two years felt unbelievable - I had been on my back for so long and I never thought I would know what it feels like to stand on two feet again.' Mrs Siddell won’t know for sure if she’ll be able to lose her wheelchair until three years after her initial paralysis. She said: 'It is a possibility that I might completely get rid of the chair. 'But doctors said they have to wait another year to determine what the long-term effects of my condition are.'","Samantha Siddell, 22, was diagnosed with tonsillitis which triggered a rare condition called transverse myelitis .

"A 34-year-old Louisiana high school teacher and her colleague have been arrested for allegedly having a threesome with a 16-year-old student after a football game last month. Shelley Dufresne, of Montz, a married English teacher working at Destrehan High School, and her 24-year-old colleague Rachel Respess were charged Wednesday with carnal knowledge of a juvenile stemming from the September 12 incident. Kenner Police Chief Michael Glaser said Respess invited Shelley and the 16-year-old to her home in the 1300 block of West Esplanade Avenue for a group tryst after the Destrehan-Helen Cox High School football game. Scroll down for video .

Detectives are now looking into rumors that the trio made a sex tape during their encounter. Former students also told police that the trio have been involved in a sexual relationship for some time now. After police learned of the allegations, they interviewed the student, who is now 17 years old, according to Nola.com. The teen insisted that the sexual escapade was consensual. The age of consent in Louisiana is 17, and the victim was 16 at the time of the encounter with the teachers. If convicted, the teachers could face up to 17-and-a-half years in prison. ‘No matter what sex the victim is, everyone should be outraged,' Glaser said. ‘You have an educator. Their responsibility is the safety and the education of children. 'They should have known better.’ According to the police chief, Dufresne and Respess have been friends and both had taught the victim. Dufrense was his teacher until this week, and he was in Respess' English class last year. During questioning, Glaser said Repsess 'almost' came clean about her affair with the boy but stopped short of a full confession.

Dufresne has taught English for 10 years at Destrehan High School, where met another teacher who now has been implicated in the sex abuse case . Shelley Dufresne was arrested at around 5.30pm Tuesday on a warrant listing one count of carnal knowledge of a juvenile. She declined to make a statement to police. According to deputies, school officials contacted the sheriff's office last Friday after the alleged victim reportedly bragged to other students that he was having sex with two teachers. Officials with the St. Charles Parish Public School District also revealed that an investigation has been launched into a second incident involving Dufresne’s co-worker that allegedly occurred in another jurisdiction. Shelley Dufresne, nee St Pierre, was released from the parish jail Tuesday evening on $200,000 bond and was placed under house arrest. The married mother of three has been ordered not to leave her home except for continued mental health treatment, doctor appointments and church services.

"Two male strippers who were less than three feet from Ebola-stricken nurse Amber Vinson when she flew from Cleveland, Ohio, to Dallas this week have shared video from inside the plane. Axl Goode and Taylor Cole, who model for romance novel covers and work as male dancers, were returning from a convention outside Cleveland on Frontier Airlines Flight 1143 on Monday night and filmed themselves on board the plane. They've now both put themselves in a voluntary 21-day quarantine and said they washed their clothes and bleached all of their luggage after learning they came so close to Ms Vinson. Inside Edition first reported on the video that Mr Cole took aboard the evening flight, where Ms Vinson was sitting just a few feet away. Scroll down for videos . Quarantined: Axl Goode (right) and Taylor Cole (left) videotaped part of their flight aboard the plane with Ebola nurse Amber Vinson (pictured here on a plane in June) Flying with Ebola: Mr Goode is seen here aboard Flight 1143. Ms Vinson was less than three feet away during the entire flight . 'If she was contagious on that flight, I was there with her in that space for three hours. I would rather keep my friends, family and other people safe by sacrificing the next three weeks and staying indoors in my apartment,' Mr Goode, 26, told MailOnline. Ms Vinson had a low-grade fever when she boarded the plane and was admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas just hours later with Ebola. She was flown to a special isolation unit at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta on Wednesday and is in stable condition as she battles the deadly disease. The CDC has said they fear Ms Vinson may have been contagious on the Cleveland-to-Dallas flight - and should could even have been contagious last Friday, when she flew from Dallas to Cleveland aboard Flight 1142. The video Mr Cole and Mr Goode took inside the cabin of  Flight 1143 doesn't show Ms Vinson. Mr Goode said he believes that she was sitting either in front of or behind him. The two friends were returning from making appearances at RomantiCon, a convention of romance novel writers and fans in Canton, Ohio, . A Dallas County epidemiologist who talked to Mr Goode today told him that he and Mr Cole were less than three feet from Ms Vinson when they flew home to Texas. Dallas public health officials say the CDC never told Ms Vinson or any of the other healthcare workers who treated Ebola 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan not to fly. Ms Vinson also got CDC permission before getting on her return flight on Monday. Now, Frontier Airlines are warning passengers aboard five more flights that they were on the same plane that carried Ms Vinson. Mr Goode said he plans to stay locked up in his apartment through November 3 - 21 days after his exposure to Ms Vinson. Inside Edition reveals that Mr Goode and Mr Cole were just three feet from where Ms Vinson was sitting when she might have been contagious with Ebola. The CDC cleared her to fly . Mr Goode and Mr Cole, who are male strippers and model for romance novel covers, were traveling back to Dallas after a convention for romance novel writers and fans . Mr Goode said he plans to stay locked in his Dallas apartment until after November 3 and will not be able to work during that time . Mr Goode's fans have raised nearly $2,500 to help them pay for their three weeks in isolation . He has been told to take his temperature twice a day - once when he wakes up and once six hours later. In the meantime, he said, he is trying not to dwell on the worst-case scenario. 'It’s certainly horribly frightening. If you read about what happens to somebody with Ebola and how  their body breaks down, it’s a nightmare. It's a terrifying nightmare come to life,' he told MailOnline.

"Behind bars: Jesse Helt, 22, turned himself in to police Thursday and was arrested for violating the terms of his probation . Miley Cyrus’ homeless VMA date finally turned himself in to police Thursday night and was formally arrested for violating the conditions of his probation. Jesse Helt walked in to Polk County Jail in Dallas, Oregon just before 8pm and was booked in by duty officers. Helt had been on the run from the authorities for three years and lived homeless on the streets of Los Angeles before he shot to fame at the MTV Video Music Awards last Sunday. Martin Silbernagel, Polk County Director of Community Corrections, said the 22-year-old is expected to post $2,500 bail and will be released within hours. 'He turned himself in and was arrested, we expect a court date in two weeks,' he said. Homeless Helt has been on the run from police since moving to Los Angeles, where he lived on the streets after breaking probation following a drugs test back in 2011. A judge in his home state of Oregon issued a warrant for his arrest for repeatedly violating the terms of his probation. Police visited Helt’s family home in Salem, Oregon Tuesday – the morning after he had flown in from LA following his MTV VMA stage appearance, where he accepted an award for Miley Cyrus. But officers left empty handed after his mother, Linda Helt, said he was not home. It is believed Helt has since been in crisis talks with family members, and it is understood Miley's camp has been offering advice. Questions will also be raised as to whether Miley paid his bail to get him released. Earlier today, an expensive SUV with California plates pulled up outside the family home and a well-dressed woman took a tray of drinks inside the house. An onlooker said: 'The woman looked very well turned out, like an attorney, she certainly looked out of place on Jesse's street.' Scroll down for videos . Night to remember:  Miley Cyrus and her homeless, wanted date Jesse attend the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards at The Forum August 24 in Inglewood, California . Helt was under mounting pressure to hand himself in after the head of corrections, Mr Silbernagel, sent him a stern message saying: ‘You can run and hide but we will find you’. He added: ‘If he wants to continue living his life looking over his shoulder making sure law enforcement isn’t behind him, that’s up to him. ‘But eventually what goes around comes around and we will find him.’ Helt could face up to a year in jail if a judge looks dimly on his behavior. He was arrested in October 2010 after he tried to break into an apartment where he said a man had sold 'bad marijuana' to him. He was charged with burglary, criminal mischief in the third degree and criminal trespass in the first degree. The burglary charge was later dropped. On November 23 of the same year, he was given 30 days in county jail, placed on supervised probation for 12 months, fined $572 and ordered to pay restitution, according to Polk County Circuit Court. Sheriff John Williams, right, talks to Linda Helt with a colleague from Polk County Sheriff's Department about her son after his return to Oregon from LA . In mugshots obtained by MailOnline, Helt was booked on probation violations on July 24, 2011, and August 22, 2011. In February 2012, Helt made the Most Wanted List for Polk County. He was listed number two on the list wanted for first-degree trespass. According to court documents seen by MailOnline, he has three formal probation violations to his name. The spotlight first turned to wannabe model Helt when Cyrus put him on stage in front of millions of people to accept an award on her behalf at the MTV VMA bash in LA Sunday night. The star wanted Helt’s speech to draw attention to 1.6million homeless youths and raise money for charity. Checkered past: The aspiring model was arrested in April 2011 (left) and August of that year (right) for violation of probation . But it has since emerged Helt has a checkered past and question marks have been raised over his homeless status given family members have said he had a place to stay in Oregon. Cyrus first hit out on Twitter Tuesday after it was revealed that Jesse was a wanted man. In one tweet, the Wrecking Ball singer wrote: 'People who are homeless have lived very hard lives. Jesse included.' She also tweeted that she hoped Jesse's case 'can be the start of a national conversation about youth homelessness and how to end it' and added: 'Does looking down upon the homeless help people excuse their inaction'. The star’s defense of Jesse continued when she tweeted: ‘While the media obsesses over one homeless mans legal issue, let's help the other 1.6 million homeless youth.’ Helt had a history of breaching the terms of his probation before he vanished from Polk County. On October 19, 2011 Helt reported to Polk County Community Corrections and signed an action plan directing him to participate in a curfew between 10pm to 6am. He was required to stay at his mother’s house during these hours. Jesse Helt pictured upon his arrival in Portland, Oregon, earlier this week. He was met by a limo at the airport. The star of the VMAs was seen smoking a cigarette outside the terminal before being guided to his ride . Helt was also directed to report for drug testing every Wednesday, but the following Wednesday he failed to turn up. On November 4, Helt’s probation officer visited the family home looking for him and was met by Helt’s mom in the driveway. She said Helt wasn’t there and that he hadn’t been at the home for ‘a few days’. That was the last time he had any contact with the authorities before fleeing to LA. Helt failed to complete any of his community service for the month of October and still has 48 hours outstanding. He also owes $460 to the Polk County Community Corrections and has an outstanding balance of $1,855.17 owed in court-ordered financial obligations. Power of fame: Cyrus invited Jesse on stage to draw attention to the problem of youth homelessness . She's on his side: Cyrus came to Jesse's defense on Twitter after it was revealed that he was a wanted man . Activist: The Wrecking Ball singer eloquently wrote about people like Jesse who are living on the streets . According to a court document recommending that a warrant be issued for his arres, all of Helt's violations outlined the same behavior: 'failing to report, failing to submit to UA testing, and failure to complete community service.' It added: 'Helt is not applying himself to supervision and is now not making himself available to supervision. 'Due to Helt's continued non-compliant behavior it is in this officer's opinion that Helt is no longer a candidate for community based supervision.' Earlier this week Helt's father said it is ‘heart-breaking’ to learn his son was sleeping rough in Hollywood - but said he is baffled why his son never reached out for help. Former Pepsi Cola executive Dennis Helt, 61, said: ‘I thought he was still chasing his dream, I didn’t know he was homeless, he didn’t share that information with me. ‘If I’d known then maybe I could have helped him. It’s heart-breaking knowing he was going through that when he’s got a family to fall back on.’","Jesse Helt, 22, walked into Polk County Jail in Dallas, Oregon, Thursday night .

"A baby which was 15 weeks old when its mother was declared brain-dead was delivered by Caesarean section at 27 weeks, after doctors kept the mother alive on life support. The Hungarian doctors who delivered the baby in July believe the birth is one of only three such cases in the world. The family has asked for privacy and has not released the identity or sex of the baby. A foetus which was 15 weeks old when its mother was declared brain-dead was delivered by Caesarean section at 27 weeks, after doctors fought to keep it alive. The Hungarian doctors who delivered the baby in July believe the birth is one of only three such cases in the world. (File picture) The child was born three months after its 31-year-old mother suffered a stroke. Her life support machine was switched off two days after the Casearean section. In the spring, she had been rushed to hospital, operated on but was declared brain-dead. She was kept on life support and doctors were able to see through an ultrasound that the foetus was moving. ‘In the first two days we struggled to save the mother’s life and it was proven... that circulation and functions stopped,' said Dr. Bela Fulesdi, president of the University of Debrecen Medical and Health Science Centre. 'On the second day when [other] examinations were carried out, we found the baby was alive and kicking well in its mother’s body.’ During the pregnancy, the father of the baby and grandmothers visited the hospital to rub the mother’s stomach and talk to the baby. A music therapist was used to help stimulate the foetus. Doctors had to fight numerous infections and would turn the woman over to avoid bedsores. The University of Debrecen Medical and Health Science Centre, where mother and child were treated. The mother's life support machine was turned off two days after the baby was delivered . While they were hoping to keep the baby in the womb as long as possible, in the 27th week, the woman’s circulation became unstable and doctors decided to deliver the baby because the womb was no longer safe. Head of the Anesthesiology and . Intensive Care Department Dr. Csilla Molnar was in the delivery room . with a select number of doctors while the family waited in the operating . theatre. ‘The aim was not just to deliver a child but to deliver a healthy child,’ she said. She added that there were three reported cases of births when the mother was declared brain-dead 15 weeks into her pregnancy - but  one of those babies did not survive. And that from those three cases, this instance is the only one in which organs were transplanted donated from the mother. The woman’s liver, two kidneys, pancreas and heart were donated to four patients. Typically, people are kept on life support for one or two days after being declared brain-dead before organs are donated. Dr Fulesdi added: ‘Our case is special because we were helping the baby [live] and additionally we could preserve…  five organs of the mother to be transplanted.’ The baby weighed about 3lb (1.5kg) when it was born and initially needed respiratory support. Despite this, Dr Molnar was confident it would survive. ‘When the baby was born it was a fantastic moment, it immediately cried out, it was kicking. …it was an unforgettable moment for all of us who took part in the treatment.’ The baby was discharged from the hospital last month but doctors wanted to wait to make the announcement about the delivery until they were sure the baby would survive. It is now developing well at home and doctors say it does not show any illnesses related to premature births although it will be continuously monitored.","31-year-old Hungarian mother suffered a stroke when 15 weeks pregnant .

"A baby's birthmark which grew into a rare and deadly tumour was treated just days before doctors said it would have gone on to kill her. Lynda Gibson, of Cumbernauld, Glasgow, first noticed what looked like a harmless, tiny red speck on the left eye of her daughter Georgia when she was just weeks old. But within a fortnight it had developed into a fast growing tumour behind her optic nerve leaving her eye so swollen her devoted parents were wrongly accused of hitting the youngster. Doctors later told Mrs Gibson and husband . Richard that if Georgia's tumour had gone undiagnosed for another ten . days, it would have been untreatable. Georgia Gibson is pictured as a baby with bruising around her eye caused by a rare and deadly tumour which developed in just weeks . The family's nightmare began when Georgia was just three-weeks-old and Mrs Gibson was feeding her. The swelling quickly got worse over the next 24 hours so she took her to see the GP the next day. Medics initially put it down to a burst blood vessel and said it would get worse before it got better. But Mrs Gibson, 38, said: 'Ten days passed and it looked like a black eye. 'She had red marks up the side of her face that travelled right up to the top of her head. She just looked like she was being battered.' Normally the birthmark, called a haemangioma, grows on the skin. But in Gerogia's case it mainly grew internally - something that happens in just one in 100,000 cases - and came close to attaching itself to the brain. The condition appeared so bad shoppers in Mrs Gibson's local supermarket took her car registration, concerned that her child was being abused. Doctors told Mrs Gibson and her husband Richard that if Georgia's tumour had gone undiagnosed for another ten days, it would have been untreatable . A family health visitor even had to step in and advise social services that Georgia had a medical condition and was not at risk of abuse. 'It was a nightmare. It started off as a little red spot on her eye and just got bigger and bigger,' said Mrs Gibson. 'When she took a growth spurt it [the birthmark] got a big growth spurt too, because it feeds off the blood vessels. She just looked like she was being beaten up. 'But thankfully we had a very good health visitor who acted as a buffer and contacted social services to let them know she had a medical condition. We had enough on our plates without that. 'Complete strangers would come up and ask, 'did you hit your baby?, ""what's wrong with your baby's face, did you drop her?"" 'You expect comments like that from kids but from adults, it was shocking. That's what I found the most hurtful.' Lynda Gibson, of Cumbernauld, Glasgow, first noticed what looked like a harmless, tiny red speck on daughter Georgia's eye when she was just weeks old. It later turned into a fast-growing tumour . It was only by chance, when Georgia had a routine check-up after suffering from a touch of jaundice, that Mrs Gibson was told her daughter's birth mark had developed into a tumour that was growing rapidly behind her eye. The doctor had recognised the signs of the tumour immediately and just hours later, after a series of tests and scans at Yorkhill Children's Hospital, Mrs Gibson and her husband were given the devastating diagnosis. The disease had left their baby with no peripheral vision and a stigma had formed in her left eye. The normal course of treatment would previously have been gruelling cancer treatment to shrink the benign growth. But she became one of the first in Scotland to be put on a trial drug called propranolol, a beta-blocker traditionally used to treat hypertension and heart conditions, which had been shown to shrink haemangiomas. Georgia was kept in hospital for 24 hours, in which time the drug had drastically reduced the swelling around her eye. Her parents then fed the drug to her through a syringe every eight hours at home for the next 18 months. All smiles: Georgia, pictured with her mother Lynda and father Richard, has now made a full recovery after being put on a trial drug . Bouncing back: Georgia Gibson's tumour is expected to have shrunk by 50 per cent by the time she is five and by 90 per cent by the time she is nine . She also endured weekly appointments to see a cardiologist, dermatologist and ophthalmologist, to monitor the effects of the drug. Georgia has now made a full recovery and like any three-year-old girl, loves going to nursery and dressing up as a princess. Her tumour is still there, but doctors have said it will continue to shrink naturally and is no longer a threat. It is expected to have shrunk by 50 per cent by the time she is five and by 90 per cent by the time she is nine. Mrs Gibson said: 'Haemangiomas normally grow on the outside [of the body] but in Georgia's case it was mainly internal. 'It was sitting behind her optic nerve and we were told we were about 10 days away from it attaching to her brain. 'We are so fortunate everything worked out and we had Yorkhill right on our doorstep.' Mr Gibson, a bus driver, now plans to walk 10 miles in aid of Yorkhill Children's Charity to thank the staff who saved their daughter and to help other children still being treated at the hospital.","Small red speck appeared on little Georgia Gibson's eye at just three weeks .

"In a discovery that sounds uncannily like the plot of an Indiana Jones film, researchers have discovered that a 1,000 year old buddhist statue found by a Nazi expedition in 1938 is made from a meteorite. The findings, published in the journal Meteoritics and Planetary Science, reveal the priceless statue to be a rare ataxite class of meteorite. The statue, known as the Iron Man, weighs 10kg and is around 24cm tall. The Buddhist statue first found by a Nazi expedition in 1938. New analysis has found it is made from a meteorite. The statue is is believed to represent a stylistic hybrid between the Buddhist and . pre-Buddhist Bon culture that portrays the god Vaisravana, the Buddhist . King of the North, also known as Jambhala in Tibet. 'The statue was chiseled from a fragment of the Chinga meteorite which . crashed into the border areas between Mongolia and Siberia about 15,000 . years ago,' said Dr Elmar . Buchner from Stuttgart University, who made the discovery. 'While the first debris was officially . discovered in 1913 by gold prospectors, we believe that this individual . meteorite fragment was collected many centuries before.' The team was able to classify it as . an ataxite, a rare class of iron meteorite with high contents of nickel. The largest-ever known meteorite, the Hoba meteorite of Namibia, is an ataxite meteorite that may weigh more than 60 tons. The statue, known as the Iron Man, weighs 10kg and is believed to . represent a stylistic hybrid between the Buddhist and pre-Buddhist Bon . culture that portrays the god Vaisravana, the Buddhist King of the . North, also known as Jambhala in Tibet. It was discovered in 1938 by an expedition of German scientists . led by renowned zoologist Ernst Schäfer. The expedition was supported by . Nazi SS Chief Heinrich Himmler and the entire expeditionary team were . believed to have been SS members. Schäfer would later claim that he accepted SS support to advance his . scientific research into the wildlife and anthropology of Tibet. However, historians believe Himmler's support may have been based on his . belief that the origins of the Aryan race could be found in Tibet. The statue is believed to have been chiseled from a fragment of the Chinga meteorite which . crashed into the border areas between Mongolia and Siberia about 15,000 . years ago. The Chinga meteorite field holds at least 250 meteorite fragments. Fragments are common, and are often sold among collectors. It is unknown how the statue was discovered, but it is believed that the . large swastika carved into the centre of the figure may have encouraged . the team to take it back to Germany. Once it arrived in Munich it . became part of a private collection and only became available for study . following an auction in 2007. Meteorites inspired worship from many ancient cultures ranging from the . Inuit's of Greenland to the aborigines of Australia. Even today one of . the most famous worship sites in the world, Mecca in Saudi Arabia, is . based upon the Black Stone, believed to be a stony meteorite. Dr . Buchner's team believe the Iron Man originated from the Bon culture of . the 11th Century. ""The Iron Man statue is the only known illustration of a human figure to . be carved into a meteorite, which means we have nothing to compare it . to when assessing value,"" said Dr Buchner. 'Its origins alone may . value it at $20,000; however, if our estimation of its age is correct . and it is nearly a thousand years old it could be invaluable.'","Researchers astonished to find priceless stature was made from rare meteorite .

"A signed photograph of Adolf Hitler that was salvaged from the ruins of his Berlin bunker in the final days of World War Two has emerged for sale for £18,000. The portrait was found among the rubble by late British newspaperman William Forrest, the first war correspondent at the scene days after the Fuhrer and his mistress Eva Braun committed suicide in 1945. The photo of Hitler was taken in 1929 after his release from prison where he served five years for high treason for an attempted government coup in Bavaria. A signed photograph (in the bottom left of the portrait) of Adolf Hitler that was salvaged from  his Berlin bunker in the final days of World War Two has emerged for sale for £18,000 . It is thought the 16ins tall picture was on display in the bunker as a reminder of his perceived struggle. Hitler took up residency in the bunker built beneath the Reich Chancellery in January 1945 and married Braun there on April 29, 1945 as the Russian army rapidly closed in. Mr Forrest, the chief war correspondent of the News Chronicle, was embedded with British troops when they arrived in Berlin at the end of the war. He spotted the photograph on the floor and took it as a souvenir of the war. A close-up of Adolf Hitler's signature on his portrait that was found by British journalist, William Forrest . In a letter from Mr Forrest that will be sold alongside the photo, he said: 'Throughout World War II, I was the chief war correspondent of the News Chronicle. In that capacity I went into Berlin at the end of the war with the first British troops. 'My reports from Berlin at that time can be seen in the files of the News Chronicle at the British Museum's Newspaper Library at Colindale, London. 'This signed photograph of Hitler was discovered by me in the ruins of the bunker and has been in my possession ever since.' The items are tipped to fetch £18,000 when they go under the hammer at The Auction Centre in Runcorn, Cheshire. The signed photograph was found by journalist William Forrest - who left this letter that will be sold alongside the photo at the auction on September 13 . Auctioneer Michael Bain said: 'William Forrest was one of the most respected war correspondents of his time and arrived in Berlin with the first British troops after the Red Army had taken Berlin. 'Among the ruins of Hitler's bunker he spotted this photograph of Hitler which had been signed and dated 'Landsberg 1925'. 'It was taken the year after Hitler's release from Landsberg prison where he famously wrote Mein Kampf. 'It's likely that Hitler had kept the photo to remind himself of the struggle he felt he had gone through. 'The fact that Hitler had it with him in the bunker in the final days of the war suggests it was close to his heart. 'Before he died, William Forrest wrote a letter explaining how the photograph had come to be in his possession. 'He passed both on to our current vendor in the early 1990s and he has had it ever since. 'This is a hugely important historical item with a provenance as good as they come. 'Anything related to World War II is desirable to collectors and we are expecting a huge amount of interest in this photograph.' William Forrest started his journalism career in 1917 aged 15 as a copy runner at the Glasgow Herald but due to a shortage of reporters he was quickly promoted to the sub-editors' desk. He went on to become one of the greatest war correspondents of the 20th century, covering Guernica in the Spanish Civil War in 1937, Germany's invasion of Poland in 1939, the Dunkirk evacuation and D-Day. Mr Forrest was awarded an OBE for his journalism in 1946 and continued working right up until the 1980s. He died in 1996 aged 94. The auction will take place on September 13.","The portrait was found among the rubble by journalist William Forrest .

Police officers have raided the London home of Labour Lord Greville Janner, as part of an 'on-going criminal investigation' in to historic sex abuse allegations, it has emerged. Officers from Leicestershire Police spent two days searching the peer's £600,000 apartment in Barnet, north London. The force refused to give details of what was seized at the 85-year-old's home but confirmed it is part of an on-going probe. It is understood the investigation is into allegations of historic sex abuse. A police spokesman said: 'Leicestershire Police can confirm its officers executed a search warrant of a property in Barnet, London as part of an ongoing criminal inquiry. 'No arrests have been made at this stage.' The former barrister was named Baron Janner of Braunstone, Leicester in 1997.

"The ex-wife of 7th Heaven star Stephen Collins revealed she was ‘sickened’ after her husband allegedly confessed to living a vile ‘secret life’ in which he abused several children. In bombshell divorce documents obtained by MailOnline, Faye Grant claims the actor used his celebrity status to prey on underage girls and ‘engender the trust of the families of the children he molested’ in a decade of abuse. Devastated Faye also revealed Collins was treated for a sex addiction and was seeing a ‘sexual dysfunction’ therapist, but he refused to seek proper help or hospitalization for his ‘predilection towards children’, she said. Scroll down for video . In bombshell divorce documents obtained by MailOnline, Faye Grant claims her husband Stephen used his celebrity status to prey on underage girls and ‘engender the trust of the families of the children he molested’ in a decade of abuse . The actor who played Pastor Eric Camden, the virtuous father on long-running family drama 7th Heaven, is allegedly under investigation for child molestation. In the court filings Faye said she first learned of Collins' 'illness' in the presence of his therapist in January, 2012 – after 27 years of marriage. And according to the papers she spent 20 months coping with the trauma of his alleged abuse on children and worrying about her 'moral and legal responsibility'. She said: 'Obviously I am sickened by Stephen's actions. I have urged Stephen multiple times to seek proper treatment for pedophilia. 'I am particularly afraid of what may happen if he does not seek treatment, because he may be working or interacting with children in connection with his employment.' Tapes of Collins' confession given during a marriage therapy session emerged in the past 24 hours. In the court filings Faye said she first learned of Stephen Collins' 'illness' in the presence of his therapist in January, 2012 – after 27 years of marriage . In the tapes, obtained by TMZ, Collins admits that he exposed himself to several young girls between the ages of 11 and 13. The NYPD is now reportedly investigating the claims Collins had 'inappropriate sexual contact' with 'at least three' minor victims. The 67-year-old actor allegedly made a written confession to his now ex-wife Faye Grant in 2012, which sparked the therapy session. Grant secretly recorded the session under the advisement of her lawyer, who told her it was legal in California to record conversations in order to gather evidence on a person who has committed a violent felony. In the recording, a man with Collins' distinct voice admits exposing himself to an 11-year-old relative of his first wife Marjorie Weinman. Collins and Weinman divorced in 1978. He also confessed to touching the young relative. 'There was one moment of touching where her hand...I put her her hand on my penis,' Collins says. Collins is best known for his role as Pastor Eric Camden, patriarch of the do-gooder Camden clan, on long-running drama 7th Heaven. Last month he tweeted this photo of a cast reunion dinner attended by his foremr co-star Jessica Biel, center . That incident of molestation was actually reported in 2012, and can still be prosecuted since the statute of limitations starts at the date of reporting. In the divorce documents Faye says Collins’ therapist subsequently disclosed to her that her husband has ‘narcissistic personality disorder with sociopathic tendencies. She said: ‘In the presence of his therapist, Stephen admitted that he has engaged in a long term pattern of sexually abusing minor children, including sexually molesting three young girls over a decade ago…I believe that there have been other victims, but he has thus far only confessed to those girls.’ Faye said that one of the victims Collins confessed to molesting lives in Los Angeles and the other two were in New York. She said: ‘The two New York victims were apparently molested over the course of several years, from the ages of 10 to 14 years old. Collins, pictured serving Thanksgiving Lunch in L.A. in 2012, allegedly made a written confession to his now ex-wife Faye Grant in 2012, which sparked the marriage therapy session . Papers: Both Collins and Grant listed their separation date as February 1, 2012 in their initial divorce filings back in May of 2012 (above) Bombshell: In November of 2013, Grant filed papers again since the divorce was taking too long to be finalized, where she revealed having learned of Collins' illness and asking that any legal liability Collins might have would not come out of her pocket . 'My understanding is that all three of these victims are now over the age of 26.’ She said it is her understanding that there is currently an open investigation with the New York City Special Victims Unit with respect to one of the victims who filed a sexual assault claim against Collins in November, 2012. ‘Again I had no knowledge of Stephen’s secret life until January 2012. I heard accounts of Stephen’s secret life from Stephen’s therapist, his sister-in-law, his sister-in-law’s husband, and Stephen himself.’ Faye says she never witnessed any of the abuse first hand and never suspected her husband was abusing children. She added: ‘After Stephen admitted to molesting the three young girls, I reported his acts to the police in both Los Angeles County and New York City.’ The couple were married for 27 years before Faye first learned that her husband had been 'engaging in a long term patterns of sexually molesting children', according to court documents. Collins starred alongside Whoopi Goldberg in the 1985 romantic comedy Jumpin' Jack Flash . In January 2012, Stephen admitted abusing three underage girls over a decade earlier - two of whom he molested over a period of several years. One victim filed a report with authorities in New York City.

"The full disturbing extent of the physical and emotional abuse boxing legend Floyd Mayweather allegedly subjected his ex-fiancee to during years of torment can today be revealed. In bombshell court documents, obtained by MailOnline, Mayweather is accused of battering, blackmailing, imprisoning and stealing from his former lover Shantel Jackson. The world champion boxer, who is due to return to the ring this weekend to fight Marcos Maidana, now faces a trial by jury after his ex filed the explosive lawsuit. Scroll down for video . Fight of his life: Floyd Mayweather will face a jury in a civil trial after being sued for battery, assault, defamation, invasion of privacy, false imprisonment, harassment and infliction of emotional distress by his ex Shantel Jackson . Teary: Jackson, 29, couldn't help but weep as she announce the lawsuit against the boxer in Los Angeles . The 29-year-old model announced she was suing Mayweather last week, claiming at a press conference that he beat her and invaded her privacy by posting a picture of an ultrasound scan online and announcing that they broke up because she aborted their twin babies. But in sensational court documents the full extent of the boxer's tumultuous on-off eight year relationship with the beauty is laid bare in painful detail. Shantel says she suffered years of hell at the hands of Mayweather, 37, whose ‘outrageous acts’ caused her ‘pain and humiliation’. During one argument, he allegedly choked and twisted her arm, while in another he held her at gun point and threatened to shoot her. He also kept her ‘prisoner’ in his Las Vegas home, threatened to publish naked pictures he had secretly taken of her while she slept and stole thousands of dollars worth of belongings from her, her court filings claim.. And in raging verbal attacks he called her a ‘bum’ and a ‘b*tch’ telling her, ‘You're not sh*t without me. I made you who you are.’ Shantel is seeking unspecified damages from Mayweather for battery, assault, defamation, invasion of privacy, false imprisonment, harassment and infliction of emotional distress. The case is due to be tried by jury in Los Angeles and is expected to last seven days, court papers show. Stunning Shantel met the boxer in 2006 when she was aged 21 and working as a hostess at an event in Atlanta, Georgia. The pair began dating and soon after Mayweather asked her to move in with him in Las Vegas. The boxer, who was last year named the highest paid athlete of the year by Forbes, showered her with gifts including a 17 carat diamond worth $2,500,000, over 100 designer handbags and masses of designer clothing . Love story: Jackson and Mayweather met in 2006 when then-21-year-old former model was working as a hostess in Atlanta . Generous to a fault: Mayweather showered her with gifts including a 17-carat diamond worth $2,500,000, over 100 designer handbags and masses of designer clothing. He also lavished her with ‘substantial cash gifts’ and allowed her to use his credit card . He also lavished her with ‘substantial cash gifts’ and allowed her to use his credit card. However, Mayweather soon became very controlling and Shantel had to ‘make herself available to him virtually at all times’ and was not allowed to work, according to the lawsuit filed on Thursday at the Superior Court of California. Shantel, who changed her last name to ‘Jackson-Mayweather’ at the boxing champ's request, stood by her man when he was jailed in 2012 for a domestic violence attack in which he twisted ex-girlfriend Josie Harris's arm in front of two of their young children. But just days after his release from prison, Mayweather allegedly lashed out at her in almost the same way as he had attacked his ex. The court papers state that during a jealous rage, the undefeated boxer twisted Shantel's arm, then ‘choked her and forcibly took her phone away from her to look through it.’ Just a week later Mayweather – nicknamed ‘Pretty Boy’ - begged for forgiveness and promised ‘he would never assault her again’ the documents continue. Some time later, while Shantel was working in Los Angeles in August, she claims Mayweather asked her for the security code for the home she owned in Las Vegas - which she had kept when she moved in with the boxer and used to store lots of her belongings. When she returned she says ‘all of her expensive clothing accessories and personal items’ had been taken. As alleged in her court papers, Mayweather – also known as ‘Money’ - then admitted he had taken her things as a 'test to see how important these possessions were to her'. He eventually returned the property in October and promised to change his behavior but problems in the relationship continued and Shantel decided to leave Mayweather in early 2013 and move to Los Angeles. In the first week of April she took the belongings from her Vegas house and put them in three storage lockers in Glendale, Calif. This enraged Mayweather who bragged to her that he had found out which moving company she had used and the address of the storage lockers. He later confessed he had arranged for one of the lockers to be broken into - and took belongings worth more than $1million from it, the papers allege. Mayweather went to ‘great lengths’ to try woo Shantel back - and she moved back to Las Vegas on April 19 in a private jet Mayweather had sent for her. But within days the couple began arguing and when Shantel threatened to leave again, angry Mayweather launched a ""terrifying and humiliating"" attack on her at gunpoint - refusing to let her leave his house, the papers claim. The boxer grabbed his fiancee, ‘bent her arm, restrained her and pointed a gun at her foot, asking: “Which toe do you want me to shoot?”’ Face off:  Mayweather is set to return to the ring this Saturday in a highly anticipated rematch with Marcos Maidana . Multimillionaire: Forbes described Mayweather the highest paid athlete in the world last year, with earnings of $105million . While ‘forcibly restraining her’ he took off a $2.5million diamond ring from her finger, took her other jewellery before telling one of his employees to remove her ‘clothes, shoes, purses, credit cards, identification and cellular telephones’ and take them to a secret location. The documents allege that ‘for a period of time’ after this attack Mayweather kept Shantel ‘a prisoner in his home’. He maintained surveillance and only let her leave the house if she was accompanied by one of his employees. Shantel made her escape in June while Mayweather was out of town and moved back to California. It was then she realized her storage locker had been broken into, she claims. Mayweather confessed he had ordered the items to be stolen and said she could have her things back if she came back to him - but she refused, according to her lawsuit. The desperate boxer then threatened to ‘put things out about her’ unless she returned to Las Vegas - but again Shantel refused. The fighter then allegedly posted her Los Angeles address on social media and falsely suggested he was living there causing the house to be swarmed by fans. She says he also started posting pictures of her stolen articles on his social media accounts. Despite this, Shantel eventually agreed to give the relationship another try after he sent a private jet to come and pick her up to watch a fight and ‘showered her with expensive gifts including Hermes handbags’ – which he subsequently took back after a row. Shantel said they could work on the relationship but she would continue to live in Los Angeles. In November she fell pregnant and Mayweather insisted she moved back to Vegas. When she refused, the lawsuit claims, he launched into a vicious verbal tirade against her calling her a ‘bum’ and a ‘bitch’ and saying: ‘I took you out of the hood. I should have left your ass there. You’re not sh*t without me. I made you who you are.’ Anguish: At a news conference in LA last week, Jackson's attorney Gloria Allred stands by her teary client . She terminated the pregnancy in January 2014 and informed Mayweather, the court papers say. A month later the welterweight boxer attacked Shantel again, according to the papers. After meeting him at his plush condo at the Ritz Carlton in Los Angeles they began to argue and Shantel attempted to leave. But the boxer allegedly ‘dragged her back by her arm into the condo and blocked the door and would not allow her to leave for more than an hour.’ Two months later Shantel went to a basketball game with rapper Nelly and posted a picture on her social media. This ‘infuriated’ Mayweather and he told Shantel that if she didn’t take the picture down he would post naked photos of her he had taken secretly when she was asleep online, she claims. The 21 page lawsuit also reveals the ‘emotional torture’ Shantel said she faced when months later, Mayweather posted a scan picture of the twin foetuses she had aborted. He also wrote on Facebook back in May: 'the real reason me and Shantel Christine Jackson @MissJackson broke up was because she got an abortion and I’m totally against killing babies. She killed our twin babies.' Shantel said this was the 'ultimate humiliation' and it cause her great 'anguish' as she had only told one friend about the pregnancy and none of her family. She also had to endure members of the public calling her a 'baby killer' a 'ho' and others asking her: 'Why did you kill Floyd’s babies?', according to the papers. Shantel said Mayweather’s actions during the course of their relationship had caused her ‘humiliation, embarrassment, hurt feelings, mental anguish and suffering' and she is seeking monetary and punitive damages and an injunction to stop Mayweather publishing naked pictures of her. Mayweather now has 30 days to respond to the summons. Last week at a press conference announcing the lawsuit shantey said: 'I have been embarrassed and humiliated more than I can ever imagine by Floyd.' She added that she had no choice but to file the action in Los Angeles County Superior Court with a 'heavy heart'. 'Ms. Jackson was terrified for her safety, and humiliated by Mayweather's conduct,' lawyer Gloria Allred said.","Sensational court documents reveal the shocking details of Floyd Mayweather's tumultuous on-off eight year relationship with Shantel Jackson .

"The desk used by Hitler to work on his plans for the most evil crimes in history has been discovered. The Nazi dictator used the simple office desk, which was made in 1937, in his ornate Reichschancellery in Berlin throughout the Second World War while his Alsatian Blondi slept at his feet beneath it. German officials say the desk became the property of the Americans after the war and was used as just another piece of furniture in a rest home for US soldiers in Berlin between 1957 and 1996. They even installed telephone and fax connections to its side. The desk belonging to Adolf Hitler was discovered in a government storeroom in Germany . The furniture was handed over to American authorities at the end of the war and was returned to the German government around 2000 . The Nazi dictator used the desk to formulate his genocidal plans, however German authorities said they will never sell the item . It was passed back to Germany in 1996 and has been kept in a storeroom since. Officials say it will never be sold, even though collectors would pay thousands for it. The desk was made in 1937, has four lockable drawers and was used continuously by Hitler until the end of the war. Hanging on one side is an outdated ticket reading: 'This item is the property of the United States and falls under the Potsdam Agreement.' The desk, along with much else besides, formed part of the fixtures and fittings of a rest home for U.S. soldiers in Berlin between 1957 and 1996. Its general manager, Norman Marcus, was responsible for the electrical upgrades fitted to its side. Some time around 2000 the desk was returned to the German government. It now resides in a storeoom in Weissensee near Berlin. This is the first time it has been pictured since the war years. Germany says it will never be sold, even though it would fetch tens of thousands of pounds to a militaria collector. 'The desk is, and remains, the property of the Federal Republic,' said government spokeswoman Jacqueline Besse.","Hitler's dog Blondi regularly slept underneath the desk in his Berlin bunker .

"A graphic designer has been suspended by the concentration camp museum where he worked for using their printers to produce anti-Semitic propaganda - including posters reading: 'Jews go home' Staff at Majdanek in Poland - where 80,000 people were murdered by Nazis during World War Two - called in the police after discovering the cache of offensive material produced on site. A man named as Krzysztof K, who worked at the museum for 20 years, is accused of being part of a group which distributed offensive Nazi material around the town. Crackdown: Police arrest one of the men accused of distributing anti-Jew propaganda from a Nazi concentration camp museum . Around 60,000 of the total killed in the camp are thought to have been Jews - around half of those who passed through the camp. 'We're shocked by these revelations,' museum spokeswoman Agnieszka Kowalczyk-Nowak said. 'We've launched an internal investigation at the museum. Management has decided to suspend him from duty while the case is being clarified.' Nazi Germany set up the Majdanek camp on the outskirts of Lublin in 1941 and ran it until 1944. Allegations: The designer was found with a collection of offensive material - including a poster which read: 'Jews go home', it was claimed . Insult: The employee is accused of using printers owned by a concentration camp museum set up to commemorate around 80,000 people murdered by the Nazis to produce anti-Semitic propaganda .

"Casey Kasem's wife will bury him in Norway and not Los Angeles as he wished, a publicist for the late radio star's daughter has confirmed. Kasem's widow Jean Kasem has made arrangements for her husband's body to be flown to Oslo after claiming that she has Norwegian heritage. But today in an embarrassing rebuttal for the statuesque blonde, Jean’s nephew spoke out to say his aunt doesn’t have ‘an ounce’ of Norwegian blood in her. Tommy Thompson, the son of one of Jean’s siblings, said: ‘As far as we know, we are English, German and Native American. Scroll down for video . Conflict: Jean Kasem has arranged for her late husband to be buried in Norway and not LA as he wished.

Kerri Kasem, Casey Kasem's daughter,  wants her dad to be buried in Los Angeles . ‘We have never ever heard anyone speak of Norway or [speak] Norwegian for that matter in our house. ‘We don''t have an ounce of Norwegian blood to our knowledge.’ Casey's family are now working with LA private investigator Logan Clarke but have few legal options to prevent the overseas burial, publicist Danny Deraney said. Mr Deraney revealed that Casey’s daughter Kerri is planning on writing a letter to the Norwegian government expressing her dismay at the situation. He said: ‘As you may have seen, Jean Kasem is planning to attempt to bury Casey Kasem in Oslo, Norway. She sent an open letter to the Norwegian government declaring among other things, her Norwegian ancestry. ‘The children, the family and friends want Casey Kasem to be buried in the place he requested, Forest Lawn in Glendale. Not to a foreign country he has never visited.’ Teruyuki Olsen, a lawyer for Jean Kasem, didn't return an email seeking comment. As the spouse of the radio personality, Jean Kasem is conservator of his body, said Deraney, . They were married for 34 years. It was unclear when the burial might occur. Kasem, host of 'American Top 40', died on June 15 at a hospital in Gig Harbor, Washington. He was 82 and suffering from dementia. His death followed a lengthy battle over his care between Jean Kasem and his three adult children from his first marriage. Deraney said burial outside the United States would be contrary to what Casey Kasem had wanted. 'He publicly made it clear to his friends, his kids, that he wanted to be buried in Forest Lawn in Glendale, in Los Angeles,' the publicist said. The Norwegian newspaper VG reported that Kasem will be buried in Oslo. 'It's been arranged, he's going to Oslo,' Wenche Madsen Eriksson, the head of the funeral service administration in Oslo, told the newspaper. She declined to say why Oslo was chosen, explaining that the family wants to keep that information confidential.","Jean Kasem has arranged to have her late husband buried in Oslo .

"The minister who married Robin Williams and his third wife Susan Schneider today relived their wedding day and said his heart went out to the woman who was the star's 'soulmate.' In an interview with MailOnline, Rev Peader Dalton reveals the Hollywood superstar - found by his assistant after hanging himself at his home earlier this week - was so in love with his bride, that the star was involved in every detail of the February 2011 wedding to make it perfect. He recalls . how the comedian made a bee-line for him after he'd given a sermon at a memorial service for the parents of one of his staff, and Robin told him he took great comfort from the minister's analogy of death . being the same as birth. Scroll down for video . Sacred vows: Robin and Susan wrote their own vows for the October 2011 nuptials. Rev. Dalton officiated at the ceremony and tells MailOnline there were around 120 guests at the low-key affair, mostly family, close friends and neighbors . Keeping the faith: Rev Peade Dalton was asked by Robin to perform his wedding ceremony after he heard the minister at a memorial service. Rev Dalton says the actor was quite taken by the idea that dying was merely a journey towards a 'fuller experience of life and love' It . was after this powerful first meeting that Robin decided he wanted the . Irish minister – who is not affiliated to any particular faith – to . officiate at his wedding to graphic designer Susan in October 2011. The . reverend, a former Catholic priest originally from Roscommon in . Ireland, told MailOnline: 'Robin and his lovely wife Susan first came . into my life about seven years ago. ‘The . parents of a young man who worked for Robin on his properties had both . died in a tragic car accident and I was officiating the memorial . service. ‘Afterwards I remember that he came up to me and said he very much liked the service and found it very consoling. 'He said he was particularly touched with my analogy of death being similar to birth. I . had said that when a baby is born they don't know what they are being . born into - but they are being born into a fuller experience of life and . love with their families. 'Death is the same - in my opinion we are not dying - we're born into another experience that is greater than ourselves and that is an extension of what it is to love and be loved. Napa nuptials: Robin and Susan's wedding was held at the magnificent Meadowood luxury resort in St. Helena, California. 'He was very taken by this analogy and we talked about it for about 10 minutes – just the two of us.' Robin's father was Episcopalian and his mother a Christian Scientist, but it is believed that Robin did not follow either path, although he embraced Christianity. 'You get a real strong sense of God when you go through rehab,' he said. Rev Dalton says that Robin was a very 'nice, humble, appreciative man.' ‘He was very generous of spirit and this his death is truly a tragedy for the whole world,’ he said.It was some years later in 2011 that Robin asked the reverend to officiate at  his wedding to third wife Susan at the posh Meadowood luxury resort in Napa Valley, California. Rev Dalton remembers with great fondness how happy and in love the couple were on their ‘beautiful’ wedding day and believes Susan will now be struggling to cope with losing her soul mate,' Rev Dalton said. 'The wedding day was very beautiful - they were very much in love and very quiet. Both Robin and Susan were very actively involved with the preparation of the ceremony. 'I like couples to be in the driving seat when it comes to the ceremony and I encourage them to write their own vows and decide how they want the ceremony to be. I remember that Robin was very involved - he didn't just sit there and nod his head. 'He had a special request to honor his mother and brother, who had passed away, by having a beautiful prayer - the prayer of St Francis read out. 'They both wanted to make sure their children were involved too - Robin's three children and Susan's two young boys, and were very appreciative that I made that happen.' Say yes to the dress: Susan's stunning strapless gown was designed by Lily Sammii, a couture designer based in San Francisco. Rev Dalton remembers with great fondness how happy and in love the couple were on their 'beautiful' wedding day and believes Susan will be struggling to cope with losing her soul mate. Lauren Myers did a 'mood board' for the bride (http://www.coroflot.com/laurenmyers/fall-projects) Rev Dalton said around 120 guests attended the modest wedding - mostly family, close friends and neighbors. There was no Hollywood glitz and glamor attached to it and the reverend says he doesn't recall seeing any of the big name stars who starred alongside Robin over the years. 'Robin and Susan created their own vows,' he recalls. 'It was a lovely gathering with people mingling and jingling with each other. ‘They also invited my wife and I to stay for the wedding dinner which was very lovely of them. Usually we just leave 20 minutes or so after the ceremony.’ The reverend, who lives in Sonoma, California with wife Margarita, said he was hit with a 'bolt of sadness' when he first heard Robin had died and was equally shocked to hear about Robin's diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. He pointed out he was keen to avoid using the term suicide and urged people not to judge the Oscar-winning star’s actions. ‘I know that for me and rest of the community round here it came as a shock,' he said. ‘I have no idea how Robin responded to being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. ‘I know it can mean having a horrible last 15 to 20 years of life and if you have other things going on in your life such as depression it may be harder to process it. Picture of happiness: The newlyweds honeymooned in Paris.  They walked the streets stopping to kiss and hug and looked very much in love . ‘It could have been an exacerbating factor in his death but we’ll never know. 'I personally believe Robin has died as a result of depression.' Rev Dalton, who conducts weddings and other services for an organization called Your Ceremony Matters as well as offering support and counseling, kept in touch with Robin and his wife after they got married. He said he has reached out to them several times since their wedding to offer them his prayers and support – including in July when Robin entered a rehab facility in Minnesota. And Rev Dalton sent his condolences to Susan as soon as he found out about Robin's untimely death. He now believes that Robin’s passing leaves many unanswered and uncomfortable questions. He said: ‘The great puzzle with the tragic way in which Robin died is how can a person do that to their wife and children? This was a couple that were absolutely in tune with each other - not in a mushy way - just in a very lovely way. ‘But you have to remember that depression hits the inner layer of our hearts. When someone is in that world – it’s difficult to see out. ‘People describe it as feeling imprisoned in a dark room with no switch – and in that situation it's so difficult to think of others. It’s legitimate for his wife and family and indeed others to ask why he did this.' Wife Susan has released two moving statements since her husband’s death on Monday. Remembrance: Rev Dalton tells MailOnline that Robin requested that the Prayer of St. Francis of Assisi be included in the wedding service to honor his mother and brother, who had passed away . In the last one, issued yesterday, emotional Susan told how Robin’s legacy was the ‘joy and happiness he offered to others, particularly to those fighting personal battles’. She added: 'Robin's sobriety was intact and he was brave as he struggled with his own battles of depression, anxiety as well as early stages of Parkinson’s Disease, which he was not yet ready to share publicly. 'It is our hope in the wake of Robin’s tragic passing, that others will find the strength to seek the care and support they need to treat whatever battles they are facing so they may feel less afraid.' Rev Dalton supported Susan's tragic plea that those who need help should seek it and said she was very selfless for thinking of others at this time. ‘It is touching that she is thinking of others who are hurting when she is hurting herself,' he said.‘I truly believe Robin Williams' tragic passing has impacted the spirit of humanity. Hopefully people will now seek the help they need.’ Rev Dalton added that he had not been approached to officiate Robin’s funeral or memorial service but believed like their wedding it would be a private, low-key affair. He said: ‘It would be a great honor to officiate the funeral - it would be a profound privilege after having officiated Robin’s wedding and hearing the vows and prayers. ‘Of course I would love to and I would like to respond in any way I can to help the family at this incredibly sad time.’","Rev.

"More than 4,000 nurseries are failing to provide a good standard of care and education - and must improve within two years or face closure. One in six nurseries and pre-schools - catering for about 150,000 babies and toddlers - need to make improvements, according to education watchdog Ofsted. Concerns range from poor standards of early education to unsafe premises, gaps in first aid training and staff smoking on the premises. More than 4,000 nurseries are failing to provide a good standard of care and education, says Ofsted . Following an overhaul of inspections, all childcare providers on ‘non-domestic premises’ – such as nurseries and pre-schools – are expected to achieve a ‘good’ rating from Ofsted. Those falling short of the benchmark will be given up to two years to shape up or face being labelled as ‘inadequate’, raising the prospect of being de-registered or closed. It was originally proposed that under-performing providers would be given four years to improve, but the turnaround period was halved amid claims the plan was too lenient. The new inspection regime – which came into force in autumn last year - also scrutinises standards of early education more closely as well as the progress made by children and their readiness for starting school at four. One in six nurseries and pre-schools (not pictured)  need to make improvements according to watchdog . Figures released by Ofsted yesterday show that 17 per cent of 23,551 nurseries and other non-domestic providers are currently falling below the ‘good’ benchmark. Among childminders, the figure is higher, at 23 per cent, although a separate system is used for inspecting and monitoring childminders who require improvement. Many of the country’s 65,704 registered early years providers were checked under previous inspection blueprints. Of those visited over the three-month period from April to June this year – the most recent inspection period to incorporate the tough new standards – 28 per cent of nurseries and 23 per cent of childminders were judged to require improvement. Of 4,177 providers inspected, 423 were ordered to make improvements to early education programmes. Some 52 were found to be operating in unsafe premises while 105 needed to improve their safeguarding practices. A total of 47 were censured over first aid training for staff and two for staff smoking rules. Twenty-six per cent overall were found to require improvement but early years leaders hailed a big improvement on the previous quarter, when 32 per cent were judged to be substandard. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Pre-School Learning Alliance, said: ‘We are pleased to see such a significant increase in the number of ‘good’ and ‘outstanding’ providers. ‘These figures clearly demonstrate that, despite ongoing funding shortfalls and diminished local authority support, the vast majority of early years providers continue to deliver consistently high-quality learning opportunities to the children in their care.’ But he added: ‘We continue to receive concerns from providers about the conduct of early years inspectors, and the serious questions that have been asked about the fairness and consistency of the inspection process have yet to be adequately answered.’ Last year the then Education Minister Liz Truss warned that some ‘chaotic’ pre-schools allow children to do what they want for most of the day, leaving them unable to sit still and listen by the time they get to primary school. She said some nurseries were filled with young children ‘running around with no sense of purpose’. An Ofsted spokesman said yesterday: ‘It is now almost a year since we raised standards for nurseries and other early years providers. So it is heartening that these statistics show that almost three-quarters of our inspections found a good or outstanding service for young children. ‘Parents can be assured that young children at those provisions are in an environment where they can learn and develop. ‘However, there are still too many early years provisions which do not help young children be ready to learn when they start school. In coming months Ofsted will be working with the providers which need to improve.’","More than 4,000 nurseries are failing to provide a good standard of care .

"Israeli intelligence spied on US Secretary of State John Kerry during failed peace talks with Palestinians and Arab states last year, it has been claimed. As well as Israel, at least one other intelligence service listened to Mr Kerry's telephone calls during a key period of negotiations in 2013, according to the German magazine Der Spiegel. The revelations come as relations between the US and Israel remain tense and amid criticism of Mr Kerry's diplomatic efforts in recent weeks. Israeli intelligence spied on US Secretary of State John Kerry, pictured at Ramstein air base on August 1, during failed peace talks with Palestinians and Arab states last year, it has been claimed . Neither Washington nor Jerusalem has commented on the claims in the magazine, which says its information came from 'reliable sources'. Mr Kerry had been speaking regularly with 'high-ranking negotiating partners' in the Middle East at the time of the alleged eavesdropping - and some of them were intercepted, according to the report. A number of the calls were allegedly made on normal telephones - rather than encrypted equipment – and would have been transmitted by satellite. 'The government in Jerusalem then used the information obtained in international negotiations aiming to reach a diplomatic solution in the Middle East,' it added. Intensive efforts to reach a diplomatic solution ultimately failed last year and relations between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Mr Kerry worsened. Last week, the Obama administration hit back at a torrent of Israeli criticism over the Secretary of State's latest bid to secure a cease-fire with Hamas, accusing some in Israel of launching a 'misinformation campaign' against the diplomat. Revelations that John Kerry, pictured, may have had his phone tapped by Israeli intelligence come as relations between the US and Jerusalem remain tense . In recent weeks, Israeli media reports have cast Mr Kerry as seeking a cease-fire that is more favorable to Hamas and being dismissive of key Israeli concerns. Some commentators attacked his attempts to bring Qatar and Turkey - two countries viewed by Israel as strong Hamas supporters - into the cease-fire negotiations. Kerry was also accused of abandoning some of Israel's key demands during the negotiations, including demilitarizing Gaza. Kerry himself, in a speech to the Center for American Progress, noted the criticism but did not give ground.

"The man who successfully piloted suborbital SpaceShipOne - the first manned private spaceflight - has paid tribute to killed Virgin Galactic pilot Michael Alsbury. Commercial astronaut Brian Binnie described Alsbury as a ‘dedicated’ pilot pursuing his dream of flying into space. Alsbury, a father of two and pilot with Scaled Composites, was killed on Friday when SpaceShipTwo exploded just minutes after it detached from its mother ship, WhiteKnightTwo. Tribute: Brian Binnie (left), who flew the first sub-orbital plane in 2004, has paid tribute to Michael Alsbury (right), the Virgin Galactic pilot who was killed in a test flight explosion over the Mojave Desert . The 39-year-old had flown missions on SpaceShipTwo for years, including the all-important first successful rocket-powered run in April 2013. He was also the pilot in the first glide flight back in 2010, and flew as recently as August 28 this year. Binnie, 61, who worked alongside Alsbury for several years at Scaled Composites, the firm which operates SpaceShipTwo, told MailOnline: ‘Mike was a very dedicated pilot who had the energy and knowledge to fly into space. ‘He had the desire to get to where he wanted to be and that was to fly the mother ship when it was built and then get in to the space ship. ‘It was his dream, he was fighting for that position the whole time.’ Binnie, who piloted the SpaceShipOne on a $10million prize-winning flight nearly a decade ago, breaking a number of flight records, is proud to have worked with Alsbury. Colleagues: Binnie, center left, worked at Scaled Composites with Alsbury, second from right. Peter Siebold, the injured co-pilot who survived the crash, is also pictured to the immediate right of Binnie . Record: Binnie flew SpaceShipOne on its prize-winning sub-orbital flight. He is pictured above with the vessel . He said: 'Michael in my mind is what I call a Renaissance engineer.' ‘He just beat me to working at Scaled, we arrived at similar times, he was put on a program to manage a pretty complex project at the time called Proteus, which was a twin engine, high altitude jet that could carry different kinds of payloads. ‘He knew that vehicle inside and out, backwards and forwards. Mike was one of these guys, you could pull out a complicated schematic and it might look like Greek to you, there are diodes and valves and dash lines and dotted lines, but he was very comfortable in that world. ‘That airplane is still the workhorse at Scaled Composites today, I’ve flown it all over the country. ‘And all credit for the functionality of that aircraft goes to Mike Alsbury. Disaster: Alsbury was killed Friday morning when SpaceShipTwo detached from its mothership (left), fired its engines (center), then exploded (right) above the Mojave Desert in California . ‘He devoted his time and effort to making sure it was the safest and best flying vehicle that we had and he delivered that in spades.’ When Scaled Composites began developing SpaceShipOne, Binnie was the test pilot while Alsbury operated Mission Control back down on earth. Binnie said: ‘I called him mini Mike because there was another, older Mike on the team. ‘He was thorough, capable, dedicated and very much wanted to be a part of the pilot community. ‘He was working hard in the background so he could put himself in a position to be considered for SpaceShipTwo - and he achieved his dream.’ Wreckage: SpaceShipTwo plummeted to earth in several pieces. The wreckage was scattered across the Mojave Desert . Tangles of wire: The devastating crash has raised fears over the future of commercial space flights . Binnie also paid tribute to Alsbury’s good nature saying he was a pleasure to work beside. ‘In this world, pilots being pilots, they are driven, they are A-type personalities, but I’ve never witnessed Mike lose his cool or his temper which is easy to do when you’ve got schedule pressures and competing designs. ‘Mike seemed to be able to rise above all that, which was pretty remarkable.’ Binnie has had a remarkable career. On December 17, 2003, the 100th anniversary of the Wright brothers' first powered flight, U.S. Navy officer Binnie piloted the first powered test flight of SpaceShipOne, which reached a top speed of Mach 1.2 and a height of 12.9 miles. On October 4, 2004, he piloted SpaceShipOne's second Ansari X Prize flight, winning the X Prize and becoming the 435th person to go into space. His flight, which peaked at 367,442ft, set a winged aircraft altitude record. It also earned him the second set of Astronaut Wings to be given by the FAA for a flight aboard a privately operated commercial spacecraft.","Brian Binnie, who flew the predecessor to SpaceShipTwo, gave tribute .

"Hundreds of copies of Anne Frank's 'The Diary of a Young Girl' have been defaced at public libraries across Tokyo, it has been revealed. At least 265 books have been vandalised at 31 municipal libraries in Japan's capital since the end of January. Most have had dozens of pages ripped out of them - with others having specific extracts torn out. Defaced: More than 250 copies of Anne Frank's 'The Diary of a Young Girl' have been vandalised at public libraries across Tokyo. Above, damaged copies of the diary and other related books at Shinjuku City Library . Shocking: Kotaro Fujimaki, director of Shinjuk City Library, displays a ripped picture book of Anne Frank's diary. He said copies of the book are now being stored behind the library's reception desk following the vandalism . Vandals have also targeted other books about the young Holocaust victim, who wrote her diary while she and her family hid from the Nazis in occupied Amsterdam during World War Two. Japanese police are investigating, but say the motive behind the widespread damage is unclear. Today, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, called the vandalism 'shameful' - claiming that the country would not tolerate such acts. Mitsujiro Ikeda, an official in Nakano, added: 'Books related to Miss Anne Frank are being clearly targeted, and it is happening across Tokyo. It is outrageous.' Renowned: Anne Frank wrote her diary while she hid in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam during World War Two . Anger: Japanese police are investigating, but say the motive behind the widespread damage is currently unclear. Above, Mr Fujimaki explains his decision to remove Anne Frank-related books from library shelves . He added that vandals had reportedly damaged some of the books while inside reading rooms at Nakano district libraries, but had gone unnoticed. Many libraries have now decided to move undamaged copies of Anne Frank's diary behind the counter for protection. Kotaro Fujimaki, director of Shinjuk City Library, said he had taken the decision to store the book behind the library's reception desk after a number of copies were found ripped on its shelves. A happier time: The Frank family moved to Amsterdam from Germany in 1933, but were forced to go into hiding in 1942 after the Nazis occupied the country. Above, Anne with her childhood friend Hannah Goslar Pick (right) Memories: Anne aged 11 (left), two years before her family went into hiding, and with her sister Margot (right) Yesterday, a U.S. Jewish rights group spoke out against the vandalism - urging Japanese police to step up . their efforts to find those responsible. In a statement, the Simon Wiesenthal Center's associate Dean, Rabbi Abraham Cooper, said: 'The geographic . scope of these incidents strongly suggest an organised effort to . denigrate the memory of the most famous of the 1.5million Jewish . children murdered by the Nazis in the Holocaust. 'I . know from my many visits to Japan how much Anne Frank is studied and . revered by millions of Japanese. Crowded: In 1944, the Frank family was anonymously betrayed and Anne was sent to her death at Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where she died of typhus in 1945. Above, women and children at the camp . Deadly: It is estimated that 50,000 inmates died in the notorious northwest German camp during the war. Above, female inmates use water to wash for the first time following their liberation by British troops in 1945 . 'Only people imbued with bigotry and . hatred would seek to destroy Anne's historic words of courage, hope and . love in the face of impending doom.' He added: 'We are calling on Japanese authorities to step up efforts to identify and deal with the perpetrators of this hate campaign.' Anne Frank wrote her diary over two years while she and her family hid in a concealed apartment in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands.

"Holocaust survivor Henry Wermuth escaped from a labour camp in German-occupied Poland and tried to kill Hitler by derailing his train in 1942 . One morning in 1942, a train carrying Hitler rattled past Klaj, a Polish village just east of Cracow. Had things gone according to plan, the Fuhrer would soon be dead, as the three-wagon locomotive was meant to crash - derailed by a pile of logs and stones on the tracks. Near the scene, a young Jewish man looked on, devastated that his audacious scheme to kill the Nazi dictator had failed. That man was Henry Wermuth, a 19-year-old inmate at a labour camp in the area who hatched the plan after befriending a disgruntled German soldier, and then smuggling himself out. Here, his daughter Ilana Metzger recounts the amazing exploits of her father, now a 91-year-old novelist living in north-west London. In total, he survived eight camps during the Holocaust, including Auschwitz... 'My father Henry Wermuth was born in Frankfurt in 1923 and is old enough to remember the rise of the Nazi party and the way Germany changed once Hitler was in power, restricting the rights of the German Jews, taking away their jobs then their businesses and turning the German people against them. He and his family ended up in German-occupied Poland and eventually in an ammunition camp called Klaj which was not a concentration camp. His mother [Ida] and sister [Hanna, aged 13] were taken away while they stayed back in the ghetto. My father still does not know how they died but he was told that they were taken on one of the cattle trains. The security at Klaj was not as strict as the later camps as it was not under SS control. Mr Wermuth, pictured above as a young man, was born in Frankfurt in 1923 and was old enough to remember the rise of the Nazi party . My father befriended a disgruntled German soldier (who he met again very briefly in Frankfurt after the war) who confided that Hitler was due to pass through the area the following day on a train. [The Fuhrer had decided to visit the Russian Front to boost morale after the Germans suffered heavy losses at Stalingrad.] . That night, my father could not sleep and decided to break out of the camp and went into the woods where he built a contraption [a great pile of logs and stones] to derail Hitler’s train. The following day, he went as close as he could to the station where he clearly saw Hitler [whom he recognised by his hair and moustache] in a three-wagon train. As the train started to roll, my father’s heart beat at double pace as he waited for the train to travel the 2km to where he had built his contraption. He waited a long time but there was no crash. To this day, he does not know what happened - perhaps a patrol or a farmer had spotted what he had done and removed it from the tracks. Henry returned to the camp. Permanent escape had probably not crossed his mind, as inmates had no idea of the horrors that awaited them in other, far more brutal camps. Mr Wermuth, pictured with his daughter Ilana Metzger, is now 91-years-old and lives in north west London . He told his father what he had done and received a telling-off as it could have got them both killed. They prepared to run in case the German soldiers came looking for him but nobody came. If he had succeeded, it might have changed the course of history. From Klaj they were moved to nearby Plaszow, made famous by Schindler’s List, though my father never heard about Schindler until the book was published. The camp commandant, Amon Goeth, had a telescopic lens on his rifle and delighted in shooting prisoners if he saw them dawdling or not pulling their weight. Transferred to Plaszow made famous by Schindler's List, Henry was shot by camp commandant, Amon Goeth (above) My father once stopped to tell two new inmates to stop chatting and get on with their work or they might get shot - but as he started to tell them, Goeth shot the one on the right between the eyes and then my father and then the one on his left. The shot aimed at my father missed him by a couple of millimetres and tore the collar on his jacket. He was saved because he tried to catch the first man who was shot and put his blood-covered hand up to his neck, which made it look like the shot had hit its target. What ensued was a frenzied father seeing his son go down and assuming he was shot. [He even began to recite the Mourner's Kaddish, a prayer said by the bereaved after the death of a loved one.] . From Plaszow, they ended up in Auschwitz where they were tattooed – my father’s number, which is still on his arm, was B3407. His father’s was B3406. From Auschwitz, they were transported to Birkenau and then several camps on including Osterode, Nordhausen and finally Mauthausen which was the last camp to be liberated on May 5, 1945. My father had gone through the camps with his father, but eight days before liberation his father died from a head injury. The Americans liberated Mauthausen and by that time my father was well and truly one of the skeletons you see in the horrific pictures of the camps. He weighed just 33kg. He was literally days away from death. My father didn’t know it but he had contacted tuberculosis but was lucky that the American soldiers didn’t kill him with kindness. They fed the inmates with too much food – these people hadn’t eaten proper food for years and their bodies couldn’t take it and so many of the few survivors died. My father is now 91 years old. His autobiography is entitled Breathe Deeply My Son – it was the advice that his father gave him as they stood outside the gas chambers in Auschwitz expecting to be gassed. Very sensible advice under the circumstances, though strangely the Germans decided to shower them – because they were strong men and good for slave labour. My father befriended a disgruntled German soldier (who he met again very briefly in Frankfurt after the war) who confided that Hitler was due to pass through the area the following day on a train (file picture) I take my father to speak at schools around the country. He hopes that by telling his story he can in some small way stop history from repeating itself, though they way that Europe is going at the moment, it doesn’t look like people have learned the lessons of the past. In 1995, my father received a medal from the German government for his assassination attempt on Hitler proclaiming him a hero. When the letter arrived from Germany, my father laughed and said: 'At the time, they would have shot me on the spot - now they say I am a hero. It is funny how times change things.' When we visit the schools, he receives an incredible welcome and response from the children from all cultures and different backgrounds who obviously appreciate him coming. As he is so old, there will come a time when he may want to retire and then it will be my job to tell his story and then in time it will be down to my children.'","Henry Wermuth, from Frankfurt, was 19 at the time .

"Cheat: Seema Bassi, 49, claimed she was a jobless single mother to pocket handouts for more than a decade . A benefits fraudster has been jailed after fleecing the taxpayer out of nearly £74,000 while running a £2.6million property empire. Seema Bassi, 49, claimed she was a jobless single mother to pocket handouts for more than a decade. But she was secretly amassing a property portfolio across Kent raking in a fortune from tenants, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. Bassi owned 26 homes worth a total of £2.6million, providing her with about £150,000 in rent a year. She bought her first property in 1994 and started claiming benefits three years later. Her portfolio included 14 flats and four houses in Gravesend, a house in Canterbury, three flats in Herne Bay, a two-bedroom terrace in Greenhithe, and a house in Richmond Street, Hartlepool, Cleveland. Some of the properties were leased to Gravesham Council in Kent as sheltered housing for asylum seekers, the court heard. Her fraud was uncovered after Gravesham Council started investigating her brother for failing to pay council tax in 2012. The paper trail led investigators to contact Redbridge Council for more details about Bassi when they learned she had purchased 18 houses from her brother. Stacks of documents were seized from Bassi's home in Ilford, including bank statements and tenancy agreements. It was discovered she had told mortgage lenders she earned £69,200 annually working for a property firm, but was still telling the council she was unemployed. In total the mother-of-one pocketed £67,819 in housing benefits and £6,118 council tax benefits. When questioned by police she first said the properties were held in trust for different members of her extended family, although no evidence was found to prove that such a trust existed. She then claimed the 18 properties that had previously belonged to her brother had been put in her name because he was unwell and could no longer managed them.

"Plea deal: Andrew Demers, 74, entering a guilty plea to a felony charge of unlawful sexual contact . A former police chief sobbed as he was sentenced to four years in prison for sexually assaulting a 4-year-old relative. Andrew Demers, 74, of New Gloucester was the former chief of Maine State Police and was one of the mostly highly decorated police officers in Maine’s history. But  he broke down sobbing repeatedly during his sentencing hearing at the Cumberland County Courthouse on Tuesday after entering a guilty plea to a felony charge of unlawful sexual contact. The parents of the child that he molested sat at one side of the courtroom near Cumberland County District Attorney Stephanie Anderson, who prosecuted the case. 'He took my little girl’s innocence from us,' the child’s mother wrote in a statement: . Superior Court Justice Thomas Warren sentenced Demers to five years, with the final year to be suspended while Demers serves a three-year probation term. The judge also ordered him to pay $5,000 restitution to pay for past and future counseling for the child according to The Portland Press Herald. Demers’ arrest on March 17 shocked the state’s law enforcement community, many of whom had considered him a model officer. He had enjoyed a 26 year career with the state police and served as chief for six years before retiring in 1993. He was the only officer in Maine history to be twice named the state police Trooper of the Year and was named Legendary Trooper in 2003. However, State police first received a tip about his alleged crime on March 10 and referred the matter to the district attorney, who asked the sheriff’s office to investigate. The abuse had allegedly been taking place at Demers' house in New Gloucester for several months, according to the Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce. Demers pleaded guilty as part of an agreement reached by his attorney Walter McKee and Anderson in which a more serious Class A felony charge of gross sexual assault was dismissed. Police: Demers' was chief of Maine State Police from 1987 to 1993 and enjoyed a 26-year career until he retired . He could have faced up to 30 years on that charge. As the judge handed down his sentence, he rejected a claim by Demers’ clinical psychologist that Demers’ actions were out of character. The psychologist argued that it may have been a result of neurological damage from post-traumatic stress from decades of police service. Jail: The District Attorney’s Office arranged for Demers to turn himself in at the county jail . Warren said: 'Crimes like this come from a dark place within a person that are often buried deep within and unknown.' Meanwhile, Demers’ attorney, Walter McKee, argued that his  client had already been punished - because his reputation was ruined. McKee wrote: 'Andy is, by every single account, the last person that anyone ever expected would be involved in an offense like this and this alone speaks volumes about who Andy is.' 'He has lived his life in a way that is the farthest cry from behavior at issue here than one can imagine.' 'There are also very real, significant concerns about Andy’s safety while incarcerated in the custody of the Department of Corrections. But the judge rejected McKee’s request that Demers be allowed to serve a lesser sentence. He did, however, grant him  a one-week delay before beginning his sentence on Nov. 11. The District Attorney’s Office and McKee  arranged for Demers to turn himself in at the county jail. At his sentencing, Demers addressed the court. He wiped tears from his eyes with a handkerchief and said: 'Your Honor, since my arrest I have been torn and torn with shame.'","Andrew Demers, 74, was sentenced to four years in prison for sexually assaulting a 4-year-old relative .

"The lawyer of 7th Heaven actor Stephen Collins, who has been accused of sexually abusing young girls, says the 67-year-old's estranged wife tried to get a witness to lie in their divorce proceedings. Wife Faye Grant allegedly demanded a witness tell the judge that she saw Collins molest a girl, but the witness did not see the incident and refused to testify, his attorney Mark Vincent Kaplan told TMZ. The nation was shocked yesterday when the gossip site released recordings from a marriage therapy session between Collins and Grant, where the actor admits to exposing himself to at least three young girls between the ages of 10 and 13. It appears Collins had some advance warning that the tapes were going to be released, as he was photographed talking nervously on the phone at New York's JFK airport on Monday, in images obtained by Inside Edition. It has now been revealed that the couple are fighting over more than $14million in their bitter divorce, and Collins' lawyer claims Grant has been trying to sell the tape for years in an attempt to get more alimony. Scroll down for video . Bitter divorce: Faye Grant, estranged wife of 7th Heaven actor Stephen Collins, allegedly tried to get a witness to testify that her husband molested a young girl, but the person in question refused to appear in court because they did not witness the incident. The couple are currently in the middle of a bitter divorce and on Tuesday, audio recordings were released in which Collins admits to molesting at least three girls between the ages of 10 and 13 . Among the assets detailed in divorce papers are $5million in property, Collins' $16,000 Rolex; $40,000 in art, Collins' $100,000 vintage guitar collection. In the documents, Grant adds that she has been left unable to support herself since she spent her peak acting careers at home taking care of their daughter and that she hasn't been able to book a job. But Collins' attorney claims that Grant has been racking up $20- and $40,000 dollar a month credit card bills, and having her estranged husband foot the bill. Grant herself says she did not release the tapes, but did give them to law enforcement two years ago just after the therapy session happened. Since the tapes were released this morning, reruns of 7th Heaven have been pulled from UP TV, and Collins lost his small role in the Ted sequel . She made even more explosive claims about her soon-to-be-ex husband on Wednesday, saying he had incestuous thoughts about their unborn child while she was pregnant. She says just before giving birth, Collins told her how glad he was they were having a girl, who they named Kate, instead of a boy who he may have sexually abused. 'The comment you made just before I gave birth to our daughter when you said you hoped we didn't have a little boy, because ""you just didn't know if you could keep his little penis out of your mouth"" was indication enough that you were sick,' Grant wrote in the email obtained by TMZ. 'I should have followed my gut then, and then again 14 years ago, and kicked your ass to the curb,' she added. But a source close to Collins told the gossip site that the allegations are 'absolutely untrue,' that he never received that email  and Grant never brought the claims up during their contentious divorce proceedings. Collins' lawyer has not returned MailOnline's requests for comment as of Wednesday. Collins is currently under investigation by the NYPD in response to the tapes. The LAPD is collaborating with New York authorities, but they initially closed their own investigation into Collins two years ago after receiving the tapes themselves and finding 'no verified victim'. In the recording, a man with Collins' distinct voice admits exposing himself to an 10-year-old relative of his first wife Marjorie Weinman, adding that he touched her as well. Collins and Weinman divorced in 1978. 'There was one moment of touching where her hand...I put her her hand on my penis,' Collins says. Collins goes on to admit exposing himself to several others girls. He says he exposed one girl 'a couple of times' when she was 11, 12 and 13. 'When you exposed yourself...did you have an erection?' Grant then asks. 'No, I mean, no. Partial, maybe, I think,' Collins responds. Collins says he  exposed himself to a girl who lived in their Los Angeles neighborhood, who he tried apologizing to years later, and a New York girl who was 12 or 13 at the time. The recordings were taken during a 2012 marriage therapy session that proved unsuccessful as Collins and his wife chose to file for divorce that year. The couple met filming a 1982 pilot called Tales of A Gold Monkey. They married three years later. Grant talked about the moment they first met in an interview with People magazine in 1999. Collins starred as Rev Eric Camden on the long-running family drama about parents raising seven children. A still taken from the final episode in 2007 . Actress Jessica Biel (second left) got her start in acting on the show. She is now married to Justin Timberlake . 'I thought, either he's gay or a complete jerk, because he can't be as fabulous as he looks and be available!' Grant told People. NYPD spokesman Stephen David says a complaint against Collins was filed in 2012, accusing him of forcing a then-14-year-old-girl to perform a lewd act in 1972. Davis says the case is open, but no charges have been filed. In the hours after the tapes were released Tuesday morning, Collins' life and career started falling apart as he was fired from a small role in the Ted sequel, was axed from a part in TV show Scandal and resigned from his position on the National Board for the Screen Actors Guild. Reruns of his hit show 7th Heaven, which ran from 1996-2007, have now been taken off the schedule at network UP TV and replaced with episodes of reality show Supernanny. And last night, police were called to the 67-year-old actor's Tarzana, California home after gun shots were heard inside the house. Collins' next-door neighbor, former Baywatch star Donna D'Errico tweeted shortly after 8pm that he had shot himself, and members of the media reported hearing a loud pop. However, the reports turned out to be false and Collins wasn't even home at the time. Shots were heard Tuesday night at Collins' home (pictured) in Tarzana, California - but they ended up being a false alarm . Collins' next-door neighbor, former Baywatch star Donna D'Errico tweeted shortly after 8pm that he had shot himself, and members of the media reported hearing a loud pop. She then apologized for false alarm . Collins is best known for his role as the minister dad on 7th Heaven, a show about a religious family raising a large brood of seven children. The actor talked about how much the role had an influence on his personal life in a People magazine interview from 1999, telling the magazine that he spent one Sunday a month as a lay eucharistic minister at Los Angeles Episcopalian church . 'I guess life does imitate art!' he said. While most of the nation has swiftly come out against the actor, his 7th Heaven on-screen wife Catherine Hicks has come to his defense. She was filmed leaving a Santa Monica hospital on Tuesday, where she said there was never any indication he was a molester during more than a decade on set together - when they regularly acted with underage children. 'Stephen is a good guy in my opinion,' Hicks said. Collins' on-screen wife came to his defense on Tuesday, after the tapes were released. She said: 'Stephen is a good guy in my opinion'. Pictured at the 2001 Teen Choice Awards, above . But that's not the portrait his estranged wife Grant has been painting in their messy divorce proceedings. In bombshell divorce papers obtained by MailOnline, Grant claims her husband used his star power to trick abuse children. 'I believe that Stephen used his celebrity status to engender the trust of the families of the children he molested,' Grant wrote. 'I further believe that there have been other victims, but he has thus far only confessed to those three girls.' In the court filings Faye said she first learned of Collins' 'illness' in the presence of his therapist in January, 2012 – after 27 years of marriage. Papers: Both Collins and Grant listed their separation date as February 1, 2012 in their initial divorce filings back in May of 2012 (above) Bombshell: In November of 2013, Grant filed papers again since the divorce was taking too long to be finalized, where she revealed having learned of Collins' illness and asking that any legal liability Collins might have would not come out of her pocket . And according to the papers she spent 20 months coping with the trauma of his alleged abuse on children and worrying about her 'moral and legal responsibility'. She said: 'Obviously I am sickened by Stephen's actions. I have urged Stephen multiple times to seek proper treatment for pedophilia. 'I am particularly afraid of what may happen if he does not seek treatment, because he may be working or interacting with children in connection with his employment.' Grant has reportedly been using the taped therapy session as blackmail against Collins for years, in an attempt to get more  alimony from the actor. His attorney, Mark Vincent Kaplan, told TMZ: 'Over the course of my representation of Stephen in the divorce case, Faye has repeatedly threatened to give this audiotape to the media unless Stephen agreed to pay her millions of dollars more than that to which she was legally entitled.

"Footballers across England will don rainbow-coloured laces this weekend - as part of an anti-homophobia in football campaign launched on Monday. Rainbow laces - which has already been backed by Arsenal players in a television advert - is now in its second year, and after being backed by The FA, should see an increase from last year where players from 52 league clubs swapped their boot strings. Joey Barton and Hull City have already thrown their backing behind the movement which is designed to send out a message that anti-gay abuse will not be tolerated in football. Rainbow laces: Everton players were among those sporting the laces during last year's campaign . Big backing: Stonewall have thrown their support behind the movement which drew criticism last year . Change of colour: Robert Snodgrass puts on his rainbow-laced boots while at Norwich City last year . The boss! Even Newcastle manager Alan Pardew got in on the act on the touchline in support of Stonewall . 'Like that of the Rainbow Laces campaign, The FA’s message is simple: homophobia, like all forms of discrimination, is unacceptable,' an FA statement said. The campaign also has the support of Stonewall, the biggest charity in Europe for lesbian, gay and bisexual equality - and they will be hoping to put some criticism of the movement from last year to bed. Rainbow laces was criticised for relying on 'sexualised innuendo and stereotypes about gay men' - while it was felt that homophobic language was being blurred with football banter by bookmakers backing the scheme. Vibrant: England and Arsenal Ladies goalkeeper Siobhan Chamberlain throws her backing behind the move . High profile: Arsenal have been very public in their backing of the campaign . Advert: Even the likes of Smirnoff have been getting involved as the campaign gets more popular online . QPR midfielder Barton, who wore the multi-coloured laces last season, told The Metro: 'There are always people who are going to complain – they will say blue is red for the sake of an argument. 'The key is getting the message out to the public that us lads are supportive of fellow pros and supporters, no matter what their sexual orientation.'

"Several hours after owner Donald Sterling was banned from the NBA for life, the Los Angeles Clippers sprinted and soared through a playoff game as if a weight had been lifted from their collective shoulders. The Clippers finished a tumultuous day with a 113-103 victory over the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday night, leaving their home court to high-fives and standing ovations from fans enthralled by the prospect of watching an NBA title chase without Sterling in his front-row seat. 'We have a tough locker room, all of us are tough, but it almost brought out tears to your eyes just to feel the support from the fans,' said Chris Paul, the Clippers' star point guard. Scroll down for post-game reaction . Fans hold up signs in support of the Los Angeles Clippers during Game 5 of an opening-round NBA basketball playoff series on Tuesday. Hours after their owner was issued a lifetime ban by the NBA, the Clippers stormed to victory . Winners: Los Angeles Clippers' Jamal Crawford (left) and DeAndre Jordan (right) celebrate after the NBA Conference quarter-final game against the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday . NBA Commissioner Adam Silver delivered the extraordinary punishment to Sterling after a recording of racist statements by the real-estate mogul was made public several days ago. The ban is one of the harshest penalties in the history of U.S. sports, but was met with near-universal acclaim from fellow owners, civil rights observers and NBA players who strongly contemplated a playoff boycott if Sterling wasn't punished harshly. 'The views expressed by Mr. Sterling are deeply offensive and harmful,' Silver said while announcing his first major action as the league's commissioner. 'That they came from an NBA owner only heightens the damage and my personal outrage. Sentiments of this kind are contrary to the principles of inclusion and respect that form the foundation of our diverse, multicultural and multiethnic league.' Sterling was fined $2.5 million, the maximum allowable under the NBA constitution. Silver also will urge the NBA's board of governors to compel Sterling to sell the Clippers, and if three-fourths of the other 29 owners agree, the league's longest-tenured owner almost certainly will be forced to give up the team he has owned since 1981. A recording of racist statements by real-estate mogul and Clippers owner Donald Sterling was made public several days ago. He has been banned from the NBA for life . Sterling made no public comment about the ban, but the owner is among the most litigious people in sports. Team spokesman Seth Burton said in an email that the Clippers had no plans to issue a statement from Sterling on Tuesday, but the franchise released a statement 'wholeheartedly' supporting Silver's decision. While the league waited to see whether Sterling will fight to keep his team, the Clippers got back to basketball with a flourish. Two days earlier, with news of Sterling's comments still fresh, the Clippers dumped their team warmup jerseys in a pile at center court in Oakland in a gesture of defiance against their owner before losing Game 4 of the series. After Silver's announcement and an emotional team meeting, the Pacific Division champions methodically beat the Warriors to take a 3-2 series lead. Los Angeles is on the brink of just its third playoff series victory since Sterling bought this star-crossed team nearly 33 years ago. 'I was really proud of them,' Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. 'I thought they were tired a lot tonight. I thought you could see them getting tired from all the emotional baggage over the last four days. They had great mental toughness tonight.' Even while Sterling contemplates his next . move, the Clippers organization rushed to distance itself from . Sterling. Shortly after Silver's announcement, the Clippers' website . featured only a black screen with a simple message: 'We are one.' The . mantra was repeated by the team's public-address announcers and chanted . by their fans several times during their playoff game. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver announced on Tuesday that Clippers owner Donald Sterling has been banned for life and fined $2.5m for making racist comments in a taped conversation . Sterling is banned from Staples Center and the Clippers' training complex in Playa Vista, a beautiful $60 million facility constructed by Sterling. He is prevented from participating in any decisions by the Clippers, or from any league activity, including board of governors meetings. Most of the advertising signage at Staples Center was either covered in black cloth or removed for the game. Many sponsors dropped the Clippers or re-evaluated their relationships with the NBA over the past several days, and Silver is hopeful they will return with Sterling's departure. Sterling's long-estranged wife, Rochelle, watched the game from a seat in the lower bowl, not in the courtside chairs usually occupied by the couple - or by Donald Sterling and a string of young female friends. One of those friends, V. Stiviano, was the other voice on the recordings made public last week. Silver said Sterling had confirmed his voice was on the recordings. He criticized Stiviano for posting pictures of herself online with black athletes Magic Johnson and Matt Kemp. 'Don't bring him to my games,' Sterling said of Johnson, the former Lakers star and current Los Angeles Dodgers owner. 'Yeah, it bothers me a lot that you want to promo, broadcast, that you're associating with black people. Do you have to?' Despite the urgency of the potential move, Sterling seems almost certain to get the highest sale price in history for an NBA franchise if he is indeed forced to sell. After decades of incompetence under Sterling's watch, the Clippers are now a successful team located in glamorous Los Angeles - and they're about to get much more valuable when they sign a new broadcast deal in 2016. After the news of Sterling's comments broke last weekend, Rivers clearly questioned whether he would stay with the team that pried him away from the Boston Celtics a year ago with a lucrative contract. The championship-winning coach, who is black, said he still hadn't made up his mind before Game 5. 'I had given it zero thought, as far as that goes,' said Rivers, who briefly played for Sterling with the Clippers. 'Obviously, Adam's decision, if there was going to be one, makes mine easier.'

"Sales of Lucky Strike cigarettes have soared since Don Draper and Roger Sterling started chain smoking the brand on the hit TV show Mad Men, angering anti-smoking campaigners. The world bought some 33 billion packs of the iconic cigarette last year, up from 23 billion packs in 2007, when the show first aired. Year-on-year, sales jumped 11 per cent, and parent company British American Tobacco is now selling the brand in 80 markets around the globe. Lucky Strike: Sales of Lucky Strike cigarettes have soared since Don Draper and Roger Sterling started chain smoking the brand on the hit TV show Mad Men, pictured . AMC's Mad Men tells the story of hard-drinking, chain smoking New York advertising executives in the 1960s and Lucky Strike features prominently as it is one of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce's major clients. The show has won a worldwide audience with fans expressing admiration for the character's stylish yet hedonistic lifestyles. But Quit campaigners claim the show glorifies the habit and has led to the increase in Lucky Strike sales. 'It's long been suspected that many people start smoking because they consider it ""cool,"" British Lung Foundation chief executive Dr Penny Woods told Purple Revolver.

Bumper sales: Year-on-year, sales jumped 11 per cent, and parent company British American Tobacco is now selling Lucky Strike, pictured, in 80 markets around the globe . She said measures including banning smoking in bars and restaurants had been effective in reducing the number of younger smokers. 'It would be deeply distressing if the glamorization of smoking on TV was counteracting any of these achievements,' she said. Lead character Don Draper, played by Jon Hamm, is a chain smoker who invariably has a 'Lucky' in hand. However, in recent episodes, he begins to feel guilty about marketing the cigarettes, as their health effects become more apparent. One episode sees Don paying for an ad in the New York Times with an open letter entitled 'Why I'm quitting tobacco' after they lost their million dollar contract with Lucky Strike. It's Toasted: Lucky Strike's legendary It's Toasted campaign, pictured, was prominent in Mad Men . Woods said plain packaging for cigarettes would be a good way to get around the association of particular brands with their use in popular culture. 'That instant brand recognition would soon die out if the cigarette packs people buy in real life look nothing like the packaging they see on the screen,' she said.

"Blackberry has revealed a radical new handset - and it is square. The odd shaped device is is set to go on sale in December, and is called passport. It features a physical keyboard - but also a large screen. The Passport combines a large touchscreen with a physical keyboard. BlackBerry chief executive John Chen first revealed the square phone (pictured) during the Canadian company's annual general meeting in June . The Fire handset was unveiled by Jeff Bezos at a special event in Seattle. 'It's time to whip the crown from Apple,' said Mr Bezos before showing off the new handset for the first time. The Fire will use head-tracking technology to make images on the smartphone's display appear to be 3D with a feature called 'dynamic perspective'. However, Blackberry has remained tight-lipped about the device. New boss John Chen announced during BlackBerry’s quarterly earnings report that the company’s next phone will be called Passport. Previously known as ‘Windermere‘, the often-leaked QWERTY device will sport a 4.5-inch 1440×1440 pixel display and what is believed to be a touch-sensitive keyboard panel for easier autocorrection. Chen announced that the Passport will be announced at an event in London in September, but wouldn’t divulge any more information, according to MobileSyrup. He also said that BBM for Windows Phone will launch in July. It comes just a day after news broke that BlackBerry is set to offer 240,000 Android apps to its smartphone users in a surprise deal with Amazon. The deal will allow BlackBerry to add a vast array of consumer-focused apps to its devices, and to focus on developing enterprise and productivity applications. However, many believe the move could be a last roll of the dice for BlackBerry after its devices suffered poor sales. In June, BlackBerry announced it was  offering 240,000 Android apps to its smartphone users in a surprise deal with Amazon. The deal lets BlackBerry add a selection of consumer apps to its devices, and to focus on developing enterprise and productivity applications. BlackBerry Bold 9900 is pictured . BlackBerry customers using devices powered by its 10 operating system will be able to access popular Android apps such as Groupon, Netflix, Pinterest, Candy Crush Saga and Minecraft. The apps will be available on BlackBerry 10 devices from this fall, when the company rolls out the BlackBerry 10.3 operating system, the statement said. The Passport (right) was unveiled alongside Blackberry's touchscreen phone the Z3 (left), and the Classic (centre) in a slide, earlier this year. It is unclear how comfortable the phone will be to hold, when making a call for example . The move is the latest by the smartphone pioneer to streamline its focus as it attempts to reinvent itself under new Chief Executive John Chen as BlackBerry phones have lost ground to Apple Inc's iPhone and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's Galaxy devices. Chen wants to remain a competitor in the smartphone segment, but is focused on making BlackBerry a dominant force in machine-to-machine communications. The company's QNX software already is a mainstay in the automobile industry, powering electronic and other systems in a wide range of cars. The announcement came on the same day Amazon launched fire, its $199 handset that will go on sale next month . BlackBerry already works with hundreds of large enterprise clients including corporations and government agencies to manage and secure mobile devices on their internal networks. Chen intends to build on those ties and BlackBerry's touted security credentials to allow these enterprise clients to build and customize in-house corporate and productivity applications for their employees. 'Making the Amazon Appstore available on BlackBerry 10 devices will help BlackBerry continue to meet two essential needs: greater app availability for our smartphone users and enhanced productivity solutions for enterprises,' Chen said in the statement.","Passport set to be unveiled in September .

"Donald Sterling’s affair with the model 'girlfriend' who exposed him as a racist wasn’t ‘his first rodeo’ and the LA Clippers owner’s wife is the person ‘least fooled and least affected by his ‘grotesque lifestyle’, explosive court papers reveal. Vanessa Stiviano’s lawyer set out a strident defense of the 31-year-old after Rochelle Sterling sued her for embezzling $1.8m – the total gifts and cash Sterling, 80, is said to have given his 31-year-old lover – including a condo, a Ferrari, two Bentleys and a Range Rover. Mac E Nehoray wrote in response to the . suit: ‘This is an action brought by a very angry wife whose husband is a . highly public figure and who is well known to the “keeping women” other . than his wife and who has done so for very many years with a big toothy . grin brandishing his sexual prowess in the faces of the Paparazzi and . caring less what anyone else thought, the least of which, his own wife’. Scroll Down for Video . 'Grotesque': Donald Sterling and his wife, Rochelle, leave after having dinner together on Sunday night. Court papers allege she knew of his 'grotesque' lifestyle of bedding other women . The lawsuit is believed to be what is behind the leaking of a tape which sparked a firestorm on . Saturday. On it, the Clippers owner appears to go off on a racist rant in which he berated Stiviano for being . seen in public with black friends, including Magic Johnson. The . shocking clip set off a massive scandal, with current and former NBA . players like LeBron James and Charles Barkley calling on the league to . take immediate action against Sterling. The NBA is investigating the claims and is set to make a decision within days and sponsors are starting to drop the team. The papers, in which Rochelle claims Stiviano has been having sex with Sterling since 2010 after they met at the Super Bowl, went on: ‘Donald Sterling has flaunted that grotesque lifestyle in front of and in his wife’s face for nearly their entire marriage of 50 years. The person least fooled and least affected and least “robbed of her due” is Rochelle Sterling. ‘At minimum, she has been complicit for over 50 years and, here, particularly, has “looked the other way” if not put hands over her mouth, covered her eyes and attempted to cover her ears. Further, this is not the “first rodeo” as the expression goes.’ Nehoray continued: ‘It is clear from past conduct, that Mrs Sterling has at a minimum, either “enabled” Donald Sterling to do, over and over again what he does, or that she approved of the varied and many gifts as described in the complaint. ‘The “relationship” (whatever it may have been or not been) between Donald Sterling and V Stiviano was open, notorious, obvious and long standing.’ Elsewhere in the papers, he said: ‘Instead of chastising her philandering husband, let alone curtailing his carousing, Mrs Sterling seeks to punish (Stiviano) who has done nothing wrong.' Despite appearing at the game on Sunday night dressed all in black in an apparent show of solidarity with the LA Clippers players, Rochelle went to eat at Flemings Steak House in El Segundo afterwards with her husband of 57 years. Pictured for the first time since hate-filled comments he allegedly made about African Americans emerged on Friday night, Sterling, who did not attend last nights game, appeared relaxed as he was photographed, while his wife attempted to shield her face with her handbag. According to the New York Post, when a paparazzo asked 'Are you a racist, Mr. Sterling?' Shelly screamed that it was all lies. 'No, of course not!' she yelled. 'Forget it. It's not true.' Just hours earlier however, she released a statement saying: 'Our family is devastated by the racist comments made by my estranged husband. 'My children and I do not share these despicable views or prejudice. We will not let one man’s small mindedness poison the spirit of the fans and accomplishments of the team in the city we love.' Meanwhile, Stiviano has gone to deny she is his girlfriend - which is bizarre in light of what her lawyer said. Sources close to Stiviano claimed she works in a purely professional capacity for Sterling as his 'archivist' and spilts her time between the Clippers and the teams official charity.

Sterling contacted Stiviano to ask, 'How can we make this go away?' amid . claims she has more than 100 hours of recordings, it has been reported. Sterling contacted Stiviano on Sunday and was told to contact her lawyer, TMZ Sports has now reported. Nehoray said Sunday that the male voice heard on the 15-minute recording making incredibly offensive remarks to his client about African Americans is definitely Sterling's. But the NBA boss claimed Stiviano released it in a bid to 'get even' with his wife because of the bitter lawsuit. 'Due to the present litigation and its absurd allegations, which Ms. Stiviano vehemently denies, Ms. Stiviano and this office have no comments at this time,' Nehoray said in a statement to the newspaper. Listen to the Rant here . Authentic: V. Stiviano's attorney Mac Nehoray said that the 15-minute recording definitely features Sterling making incredibly offensive remarks to his client, pictured, about African Americans . In court documents filed March 7 by Sterling's spouse of 50 years and the mother of his three children, Rochelle Sterling writes that her husband and Stiviano - who also goes by the aliases Vanessa Maria Perez, Monica Gallegos, Maria Monica Perez Gallegos and Maria Valdez – first met in 2010 at the Super Bowl. According to Mrs Sterling's lawsuit over the past four years, her husband used their commonly owned resources to buy his girlfriend a 2012 Ferrari, a pair of Bentleys and a 2013 Range Rover worth a total of more than $500,000. In additional to the high-end vehicles, some of which are prominently featured on Stiviano's instagram account documenting her high-flying lifestyle, Mr Sterling also gifted her $1.4million to buy a duplex on West 4th Street in Los Angeles and $240,000 for living expenses.

According to Rochelle Sterling, before she filed her complaint in court, Donald Sterling himself had asked Stiviano to return the money and property, but the woman allegedly refused. Nehoray, presented a counter-argument, claiming that a gift cannot be revoked by the giver – legalese for ‘no taksies backsies.’ In a court filing, the lawyer also insisted that there is not ‘a peppercorn of a fact’ that his client committed any fraud or exercised undue influence. Nehoray added that nowhere in Mrs Sterling’s lawsuit does it say that ‘the feminine wiles of Ms. Stiviano overpowered the iron will of’ Donald Sterling, ‘who is well known as one of the most shrewd businessmen in the world.’","Model Vanessa Stiviano is being sued for $1.8m by Donald Sterling's wife - thought to be behind the leaking of racist comments, believed to be made by LA Clippers owner .

"We may soon be able to virtually explore our local universe in the same way we explore Earth -  thanks to a new map of space that plots the location and flow of our nearest galaxies. The Cosmography of the Local Universe was created by Helene Courtois from the University of Lyon and a team of researchers. It attempts to map the universe up to around 3,000 million light years away from Earth including the the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies. Scroll down for video . The Cosmography of the Local Universe was created by Helene Courtois from the University of Lyon and researchers from the University of Hawaii. It attempts to map the universe up to around 3000 million light years away from Earth including the the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies. The Local Supercluster, also known as the Virgo Supercluster contains the Virgo Cluster and the Local Group. This Local Group is centred around the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies. At least 54 galaxy groups and clusters have been found within its diameter which is thought to be around 10 mega-light years wide. In 1982 astronomer R. Brent Tully published research explaining the basic structure of the Local Supercluster. His findings said the Supercluster consists of two components: a flattened disk containing two-thirds of the supercluster's  galaxies, and a roughly spherical halo containing the remaining third. Courtois, along with researchers Daniel Pomarede, Yehuda Hoffman and Denis Courtois, has now produced a 17-minute video explaining what the mapping shows us. R. Brent Tully is also listed as a contributor and it was his 1982 paper that first presented the basic structure of the Local Supercluster of galaxies. Tully is an astronomer at the Institute for Astronomy in Honolulu, Hawaii. The video is part of the Cosmic . Flows project. It is made up of various . 3D representations of the local universe that the researchers animate, rotate, pan and zoom around during the video. The flat plain of galaxies is turned into a 3D representation in the video by French astronomers. Each galaxy is colour-coded to signify distance from Earth. The nearest galaxies are shown in dark blue and gather around the Virgo Cluster 'equator' and the Formax Cluster in the lower-left quadrant . Our local galaxy is visualised around the Virgo Cluster equator - centred at the Milky Way. The galaxies nearer this equator are densely populated, while empty spaces around these stars are called voids . Courtois also provides a commentary of what each graphic represents and points out areas of interest. Each galaxy in the video is colour-coded to signify distance from Earth. The nearest galaxies are shown in dark blue and gather around the Virgo . Cluster 'equator' and the Formax Cluster in the lower-left . quadrant. The most significant structures highlighted are the Pavo-Indus Supercluster next to the Local, or Virgo, Supercluster. Another graphic taken from the Cosmography of the Local Universe video map shows velocity flow lines between the galaxies. High density regions of galaxies are shown in red while voids are shown in blue. In the video the region around the Centarius and Fornax Clusters are densely populated so have many velocity flows . The Local Supercluster contains the Local Group; made up of around 54 galaxies including the Milky Way and dwarf galaxies. Its gravitational center is located somewhere between Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxy. The Local Group covers a diameter of 10 megalight-years. The video then zooms in to show the galaxies nearest to Earth, including the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy. By rotating the galaxies, the researchers were able to see that most of our nearest galaxies lie on a flat plain. In one graphic, rows . are shown coming from each galaxy to show their relative distance from Earth. Galaxies that move in a deviant or . peculiar way towards Earth are shown with dark blue arrows and . deviant motions away from Earth are shown in red. In this cosmography graphic, rows are shown coming from each galaxy to show their relative distance from Earth. Galaxies that move in a deviant or peculiar way towards Earth are shown with dark blue arrows and deviant motions away from Earth are shown in red . Galaxies to the right of the Milky Way tend to have blue arrows while the ones to the left have red ones. The researchers claims this is evidence there is a flow of movement that picks up speed from right to left across our local galaxies. Another 3D representation created by the researchers for the video shows velocity flow lines between the galaxies. High density . regions of galaxies are shown in red while voids are shown in blue. Voids are large spaces in the universe that don't have any, or contain only a handful, of galaxies. In the video the region around the Centarius Cluster is densely populated so is shown in red with many velocity flows travelling into it. The film then ends with a 'fanciful view of the supergalactic equator.' The left-hand image from the Cosmography of the Local Universe map shows the layout of our closest galaxies with the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies highlighted. The right-hand graphic shows the surrounding galaxies that make up a proportion of the Local Group within the Local Supercluster . This cosmography represents around 0.32 per cent of the entire universe and scientist claim the visible universe extends 93 billion light years away. This doesn't include parts of the universe that are not visible. According to the video, our local universe is full of clusters of galaxies and filaments that form the edges between large voids. 'The complexity of what we are seeing is almost overwhelming,' said Courtois during her commentary. The cosmography film ends with a 'fanciful view of the supergalactic equator,' pictured.

"On the run: Shortly after this picture was taken Nasser Ahmed fled the UK following a £156m fraud but now claims he keeps trying to hand himself in but the authorities won't take him home . Britain's second most wanted fraudster on the run after being convicted of a £156million tax scam claims he keeps trying to hand himself in but the Government refuses to collect him. Nasser Ahmed, 41, fled the country minutes before a jury found him guilty of defrauding HMRC and was sentenced to six years in jail as he boarded a plane to the Middle East. But after nine years on the run, Ahmed wants to hand himself in after admitting 'life on the run isn't as glamorous as it seems'. He says he has contacted the courts, British Embassy, Foreign Office - and even the HMRC 'Most Wanted' hotline - but claims his pleas to face justice have been ignored. He is unable to return to the UK under his own steam because he no longer holds a passport and it is understood he cannot apply for one because he is a wanted criminal. HMRC say they would like him to return the UK, but have not been given clear guidance of his location, saying his family told them he was in Pakistan, not the Middle East as he claims. Sources also told MailOnline that Ahmed could hand himself in at the nearest British embassy. Speaking from a mystery location - understood to be Dubai - Ahmed said: 'I fled court because there were certain liabilities or commitments which would have put me in future problems. 'I was 32 when it all happened and I took the decision to leave, but in time one realises life on the run isn't as glamorous as it may seem. 'I want to fight now to show the businesses targeted were totally legitimate. 'I would imagine I'm facing 12 to 18 months extra in prison at least. But that is the way it is. 'I'm happy to do that and I will be appealing - if I ever get there.' Ahmed has contacted the British Embassy in the country he is in, the Foreign Office in the UK and Bristol Crown Court. His lawyer has contacted HMRC. The cash he pocketed from the staggering scam would have put him among the top 250 richest people and made him more wealthy at the time than David Beckham. Ahmed fled justice at the end of a nine-day trial at Bristol Crown Court in February 2005 after he was found guilty of fraud and a warrant was issued for his arrest. His scam centred around the illegal sale of computer chips which he bought in massive quantities from a company in Luxembourg - paying no VAT between 2001 and 2005. He then sold them on to two companies in England for less than he paid for them but collected VAT from the buyers which he did not pass on to the taxman. During one seven-week period, £500,000 went into his Royal Bank of Scotland account every day and he had various offshore accounts, the court heard. Ahmed, from Knowle, Bristol, even brazenly continued to pass vast sums through his accounts while facing charges. Criminal: Ahmed was last seen here at Bristol Crown court nine years ago. He claims that he is in the Middle East but recent HMRC intelligence says he is not . A confiscation hearing held after an investigation into Ahmed's finances was told although he was convicted of defrauding £800,000, he actually made £156million. The most wanted fraudster - the one to have cost the taxpayer the most - is Hussain Asad Chohan, 44. Smuggler Chohan, is wanted after failing to appear in court for his part in an estimated £200 million fraud in April 2006. Among other offences, Chohan imported 2.25 tonnes of hand-rolling tobacco worth £750,000 in duty alone in in August 2000. Chohan, from Birmingham, was tried in absence and found guilty and was sentenced to 11 years in prison for smuggling and fraud offences and failing to appear in court. Along with his sentence Chohan - thought to be living in Dubai - was also served with a £33 million confiscation order. After the trial, Revenue and Customs investigator Chris Ballard said: 'This was not some kind of advanced tax planning but organised fraud on a massive scale perpetrated by criminals bent on making fast and easy profits at the expense of the British taxpayer. 'This was the theft of revenues needed to fund our country’s public services.' Last year the businessman's mugshot appeared on HMRC's most wanted list after intelligence confirmed he was in Pakistan. A few months ago Ahmed - now believed to be in Dubai - and his lawyer made steps to get the fraudster back to the UK but have been unable to because of his lack of passport. He owes more than anyone else on the HMRC's latest most wanted gallery, released in August 2013. Natasha Murray, a solicitor from BCL Burton Copeland looking after his case, said: 'I think it's absolutely disgraceful. 'Apparently he is the second most wanted and they are desperate to track him down, but that doesn't seem to be what is happening. 'It's just bizarre that they say this man owes millions and millions but they can't even be bothered to go and get him. 'He has been away from his family and his wife for long enough now and wants to come back. 'He's going to have to serve his time, but he understands that and is ready. At least this way he will be able to see his family.' Ms Murray would not confirm his current location and Ahmed only said he lived 'somewhere in the Middle East'. Ahmed is likely to have to serve the six years in prison handed to him at Bristol Crown Court as well as further punishments for failing to pay a confiscation order and skipping bail. Nick Mann, spokesperson for HMRC, said: 'HMRC has no objection to Nasser Ahmed returning to the UK but we have not been notified of any firm arrangements from either him or his solicitor in terms of his return. 'We did speak with a solicitor representing the family earlier this year and said that we understood that Mr Ahmed was located in Pakistan.' Fraudster Nasser Ahmed first contacted the authorities in March or April in a bid to get home. He is married with children who are understood to still live in the UK.","Nasser Ahmed fled the UK shortly before a jury convicted him of fraud .

"A teenager was just two weeks from death after he was turned into an anorexic by playground bullies who teased him about his weight. Kyle Carter, 17, battled the condition for four years and saw his weight drop to five stone. Kyle, of South Shields, Tyne and Wear, started losing weight after he was tormented by bullies about putting on weight when he was just 11 years old. Battle: Kyle Carter was just two weeks from death when he developed anorexia after playground bullies teased him for putting on weight (left). While he was anorexic (right) he plummeted to just 5st . He started refusing to eat and was later sectioned under the Mental Health Act. Up to seven medics would have to hold him down and feed him by tube. Kyle is now back to full health and says he wants to use his experience to help others and raise the profile of anorexia among boys. He said: 'Six or seven people would have to hold me down. Looking back now I realise it had to happen - I wasn’t going to eat. 'I was two weeks from death. I wouldn’t be here if they hadn’t done that. 'Now I have recovered I need to share my story, because I can turn my struggles into a positive. Today I can look in the mirror and love what I see.' Kyle (pictured before developing anorexia) became so ill he had to be sectioned under the Mental Health Act . Kyle’s ordeal began at the age of 11 after playground bullies taunted him about his body, making him believe he would soon grow too fat for his school uniform. He recalled: 'There was this new kid who turned up in the last year of primary school and he called me a fatty. 'It . happened on a number of occasions and I think that was the trigger . really. It got to the point where I wanted to stop going to school. 'It really started to get to me. Then when I went to secondary school someone else called me a fatty. As his confidence plummeted, he became too scared to look in a mirror and began watching what he would eat. Kyle (pictured with his mother, Andrea) believes his illness was triggered by bullies calling him 'fatty' It wasn’t long before he virtually stopped eating and his weight started to plummet. He . was diagnosed with anorexia in early 2010, at the age of 14, and a . short time later he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act. Kyle, who is currently studying for a health and social care diploma, said: 'A big turning point came when I was scared to put on my school uniform because I was afraid it would be too tight. 'The more weight I lost, the more overweight I felt I was - that’s the way it works. 'Looking in the mirror became a big problem, because my body image was horrific. It spiralled out of control after that. 'I was overrun by the eating disorder. I was 90 per cent eating disorder, 10 per cent me.' He added: 'I lost so much weight I wasn’t allowed to go to school any more. At the height of his illness, Kyle had to be held down by medics while he was tube fed . 'The . longer it went on, the more weight I started to lose. After a while I was sent to a specialist hospital in . Scotland. I was taken by ambulance and I literally had to be chained in . the back of the ambulance to stop me trying to escape. 'I was not Kyle any more, and my mum and dad were told I was just two weeks from death. 'I was gradually weaned off the tube feed, and they introduced snacks slowly. It was hard. I was crying when I had my first meal, but things gradually got easier.' His condition also put a huge strain on his parents, Andrea Welsh and David Carter, both 40, and his little sister Kara, now seven. His mother said: His mum said: 'He was under six stone at one point, which for a boy is really low. It stunted his growth. 'His hair fell out, his skin would flake off, and he didn’t want to get showered. It was incredibly stressful.'

Now weighing a healthy 9st 12lbs, he said: 'Now I have recovered I need to share my story, because I can turn my struggles into a positive.' Kyle said: 'On reflection, it’s scary to think how much of a hold the illness had over me - the things I was doing just weren’t me, it was crazy. 'As soon as I was released from the hospital and I got home I started refusing food again - I took advantage of the control I had which I regret on reflection, but it just wasn’t me. 'It’s so hard to get over eating disorders and I have now set up several support groups to try and help others going through it.

"The number of employment tribunal claims lodged by staff against their company has plunged by more than half since fees were introduced in the summer. Leading law firm Hugh James said the total fell from 17,153 in July to fewer than 7,500 in August, a drop of more than 55 per cent. Since the end of July, employees who want to lodge a claim against their firm have to pay fees of up to £1,200 before their case can be heard. Lord Alan Sugar (left) branded ex-employee Stella English (right) a 'money-grabber' after she made a claim . It is the first time there has been a charge on workers since tribunals were introduced in the 1960s. Employees with relatively simple grievances such as a dispute over rates of pay must stump up £160 to launch a claim and a further £230 for a tribunal hearing. In claims for unfair dismissal, racial or sexual discrimination, or where employees say they have been sacked because of whistleblowing, they must hand over £250 to lodge the claim and a further £950 if the case goes ahead. These sums are repaid if the employee wins. The levies were introduced as part of measures announced by David Cameron to curb the estimated £1billion a year in payouts to those who claim to have been wrongly dismissed or to have suffered discrimination. They were brought in because of fears of a growing ‘claims culture’ of people going to tribunals in an attempt to extract large sums from their employers and threatening to smear their reputations. Lord Sugar has warned that employees have been able to exploit the rules in order to blackmail small businesses to settle claims because they are often afraid of losing and being ordered to pay huge damages. In April the peer launched a scathing attack on Apprentice winner Stella English after she lost a constructive dismissal case against him at the East London employment tribunal. John McCririck claimed unfair dismissal against Channel 4 after he was dismissed in favour of a younger presenting team headed by Clare Balding . He branded 34-year-old Miss English a ‘money-grabber’ and a ‘chancer’ and said the case was an ‘abuse of the tribunal system.’ Last month horse-racing pundit John McCririck lost his £3million age discrimination case against Channel 4 after a tribunal ruled that he was ‘unpalatable to a wider potential audience’. McCririck, 73, claimed he was sacked by the TV channel last year when it unveiled a new, younger presenting team headed by Clare Balding, 42. But the Central London employment tribunal panel said that in its judgment McCririck’s ‘arrogant and confrontational’ style put off many viewers. Emma Burns, head of employment law at Hugh James, said businesses spend ‘considerable time and money’ defending themselves in claims launched by employees. ‘Drawn out workplace disputes that reach the tribunal can have a crippling financial effect on both businesses and workers,’ she added. ‘Employees now need to consider more carefully whether the cost of launching a claim against their employer or ex-employer justifies the cost and risk of being unsuccessful. ‘It may no longer be a good idea to make a speculative attempt to get money out of their employer.’ Unison, one of the biggest unions, is challenging the fees with the backing of the Human Rights Commission. It says the charges are contrary to European Union law and will make it impossible for many workers to exercise their rights. Miss Burns warned that if it succeeds in having them overturned, there could be a ‘sharp rise in employees pursuing litigation against their employers’. Employers who lose a straightforward unfair dismissal case may have to pay a maximum of a year’s salary up to £74,000 but there is no limit in cases of racial or sexual discrimination or whistleblowing. The number of claims surged in July ahead of the introduction of charges. Unions said the drop in claims is ‘worrying’ and that workers may have been deterred from bringing valid claims against unscrupulous employers. Sarah Veale, head of employment rights at the TUC, said: ‘It is very worrying that this Christmas a number of employees who may have been appallingly treated at work won’t be able to have this tested in court because they can’t afford to risk paying the fee and not getting the money back if they lose.’","Tribunal cases have halved since charges were introduced in the summer .

"A father-of-three bitten by a false widow spider says he feared he would need his leg amputated. Jason Butler, from Barry, South Wales, was bitten at the beginning of July while in his garden shed. The 41-year-old had been moving boxes around when the five spiders ran out from a gap between them. Scroll down for video . Jason Butler nearly lost his left leg after being bitten by a spider in his garden shed four weeks ago . Unafraid of creepy crawlies, he let them run past him - and as they did, he says one bit him on the ankle. 'I felt the pinch, grabbed the spider and pulled it off,' he said. 'At the time it wasn’t painful, just a gentle sting.' But just hours later, the bite on his ankle had become red and itchy and his leg ballooned to three times its normal size. His GP prescribed antihistamines to help the allergic reaction and then antibiotics. Now in excruciating pain, Mr Butler's family forced him to go to A&E. Doctors at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff took one look at his leg and decided to operate. Surgeons carried out two operations to drain the wound before putting Mr Butler on a six-month course of antibiotics. Mr Butler's wound from the spider bite. Surgeons carried out two operations to drain it . Mr Butler said: 'They told me that if I hadn't gone to hospital, I may have needed my foot amputated' Doctors have told Mr Butler he faces another six months of treatment to recover fully . He said: 'The surgeon opened it out to drain fluid and the infection and then did the same two days later.' 'They told me that if I hadn’t gone to hospital I could have needed my foot amputated.' Although medical professionals have not commented on the type of spider bite he suffered, Mr Bulter and his wife . Sonia are convinced it was a ‘False Widow’ spider with a bulbous, shiny . black back. Doctors have told him he faces another six months of treatment to recover fully. Now back home, he is undergoing negative pressure vacuum wound treatment to get more of the infection out. Mr Bulter added: 'Everybody is shocked – even the district nurses. I went up to the hospital again for treatment last Friday and a girl was in there with a badly swollen leg from a spider bite. 'I want people to be aware of the dangers.  Barry to be aware of the danger.' The false widow spider, which is said to be spreading further north due to warmer weather, has the worst bite of any spider in the UK. Cousin of the Black Widow and about the size of a 50 pence piece, the spider came to the UK more than 100 years ago in crates of fruit from the Canary Islands. False widow spiders are distinctive for their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns. Millions of false widows, Britain's most venomous spider, have been found across the UK and the population is believed to be growing. The species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a skull. They have long legs and can reach about 15mm in size. Also known as steatoda nobilis, the spider is frequently confused for the black widow, which has deadly venom. The false widow was first spotted in the UK in Torquay, Devon, in 1879, and it is understood that it may have made its way to these shores from Madeira or the Canary Islands in a shipment of bananas. The Natural History Museum says that warmer summers mean the spider is spreading northwards through the UK, having been found mainly in southern England.","Jason Bulter, 41, saw the spider while clearing out his shed four weeks ago .

"LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling is certainly no stranger to allegations of racially charged incidents nor sordid sexual scandal. Indeed, back in 2003 the billionaire real estate mogul was a regular client of a $500-an-hour prostitute, Alexandra Castro, regularly seeking her advice on team matters. The Beverly Hills woman, who the-then 70-year-old Sterling described as a 'freak' with whom he had sex with 'all over my building, in my bathroom, upstairs, in the corner, in the elevator', was eventually sued by the Clipper's boss to get a home back he gifted her in 2003.

Controversy: Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling has been in and out of the news over the past decade facing allegations of racism . Labeling her a 'piece of trash', Sterling described his relationship with Castro as 'purely sex for money, money for sex, sex for money, money for sex.' 'The girl was providing sex for money. ... I probably didn't tell my wife ... maybe I did something morally wrong. 'When you pay a woman for sex, you are not together with her,' he further testified.

Despite Stiviano's lawyer stating that the model wasn't Sterling's . 'first rodeo', she is now claiming she isn't his girlfriend . The graphic testimony from Sterling was included in a 2009 lawsuit the real estate mogul launched to have the home returned to him from Castro. Having previously denied that they had a three-year relationship with Castro from 1999 to 2002, Sterling changed his testimony for the 2009 case. In explicit detail he recalled sexual encounters he spent with Castro, who Sterling said was expert in bed and whose 'best sex was better than words could express.' During the relationship which reportedly lasted between 1999 and 2002, the Los Angeles Clippers owner had transferred the title of a Beverly Hills home he owned to Castro and her mother. However Castro won the case in 2003 and kept the property, according to the report. Speaking in 2009, Castro said  'During our relationship, Mr Sterling consulted me on issues he was considering almost every day including, among others, whether he should hire Alvin Gentry to coach the Los Angeles Clippers (although I had no experience in such matters).' Legal battles: Donald Sterling has been in and out of court fighting tenants and ex-girlfriends over the past decade . She added that he asked her: '..how he should respond to requests by players for the Los Angeles Clippers for increases in their compensation (Mr. Sterling and I often had dinner at the Arena Club with agents for a number of players)' In addition her attorney Raymond Hersh said in a deposition about their relationship that; 'She cooked, drove, cleaned, was consulted on remodeling apartments, who went to dinner with agents, who should be hired -she didn’t make the decision, she said, but she was consulted about who to hire in the Clipper organization and what should be done, what he was thinking.' That very same year, the US Department of Justice sued Sterling for racial discrimination in housing minorities in some of his properties in Los Agneles. He agreed to a $2.76 million settlement that alleged discrimination against African Americans, Latinos and children at apartment buildings he owned. Sterling denied all the charges leveled by the Justice Department and in two other lawsuits brought by former tenants. They alleged that property managers hired by Sterling would user racial slurs against them and would lose rent checks and then claim that they had not paid. In the settlement, Sterling did not admit any liability. Turning a blind eye?

Deadspin reprinted court depositions from 2009, which included the allegations from Sumner Davenport, one of Sterling's property supervisors that he wanted to cultivate a stern and intolerant image. Davenport said that mean, 'no black, no Mexican-Americans, no children and government-housing-subsidy recipients as tenants.' According the testimony of some of his tenants in 2003, Sterling 'made life difficult for residents. 'They refused rent checks, then accused renters of nonpayment. They refused to do repairs for black tenants and harassed them with surprise inspections, threatening residents with eviction for alleged violations of building rules.' Sterling allegedly made a shocking remark when he walked into a newly acquired building he had bought that had African-American tenants. 'That's because of all the blacks in this building, they smell, they're not clean,' he said, according to Davenport's testimony. 'And it's because of all of the Mexicans that just sit around and smoke and drink all day.' The allegations included Sterling’s properties not renting to non-Koreans in Koreatown or African Americans in Beverly Hills. According to the lawsuit, Sterling believed Korean-American tenants 'will live in whatever conditions he gives them and still pay the rent without complaint.'

Donald Sterling’s affair with the girl who exposed him as a racist on Friday wasn’t ‘his first rodeo’ and the LA Clippers owner’s wife is the person ‘least fooled and least affected by his ‘grotesque lifestyle’, explosive court papers reveal. Vanessa Stiviano’s lawyer set out a strident defense after Rochelle Sterling sued her for embezzling $1.8m – the total gifts and cash Sterling, 80, is said to have given his 31-year-old lover – including a condo, a Ferrari, two Bentleys and a Range Rover. He said: ‘This is an action brought by a very angry wife whose husband is a highly public figure and who is well known to the 'keeping women' other than his wife and who has done so for very many years with a big toothy grin brandishing his sexual prowess in the faces of the Paparazzi and caring less what anyone else thought, the least of which, his own wife’. The papers, in which Rochelle claims Stiviano has been having sex with Sterling since 2010, went on: ‘Donald Sterling has flaunted that grotesque lifestyle in front of and in his wife’s face for nearly their entire marriage of 50 years. The person least fooled and least affected and least “robbed of her due” is Rochelle Sterling. ‘At minimum, she has been complicit for over 50 years and, here, particularly, has “looked the other way” if not put hands over her mouth, covered her eyes and attempted to cover her ears. Further, this is not the “first rodeo” as the expression goes.’ Stiviano’s lawyer, Mac E Nehoray continued: ‘It is clear from past conduct, that Mrs Sterling has at a minimum, either “enabled” Donald Sterling to do, over and over again what he does, or that she approved of the varied and many gifts as described in the complaint. ‘The “relationship” (whatever it may have been or not been) between Donald Sterling and V Stiviano was open, notorious, obvious and long standing.’ Elsewhere in the papers, he said: ‘Instead of chastising her philandering husband, let alone curtailing his carousing, Mrs Sterling seeks to punish Stiviano who has done nothing wrong.’ The news come as it emerged Sterling's his estranged wife Shelly Sterling dined with the NBA boss just hours after calling his comments despicable in a public statement. 'Our family is devastated by the racist comments made by my estranged husband,' Mrs Sterling said in a statement Sunday night. 'My children and I do not share these despicable views or prejudice. We will not let one man’s small mindedness poison the spirit of the fans and accomplishments of the team in the city we love.' But according to the New York Post, soon after the pair were spotted leaving Fleming's steakhouse in LA. When asked by a paparazzo 'Are you a racist, Mr. Sterling?' Shelly screamed that it was all untrue.","Billionaire LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling, 80, has had his personal life played out in court over the past decade .

"A 21-year-old woman has saved her mother’s life by giving her a kidney. Milissa Hutchinson, known as Millie, from Walsall, went under the knife on Valentine's Day to donate a kidney to her mother, Mandy. Mrs Hutchinson, 49, had been suffering from kidney failure for more than a year after her body's immune system began attacking her kidneys. Milissa Hutchinson, 21, has donated a kidney to save her mother Mandy's life. The operation took place on February 14 this year at University Hospital Coventry . Mrs Hutchinson (left) with Milissa (right) and sister Natalie (centre). The 49-year-old had been suffering from kidney failure for more than a year after her body's immune system began attacking her kidneys . Her daughter immediately volunteered to help after helplessly watching her become dependent upon dialysis. She said she wanted to repay her mother for giving her the gift of life. Ms Hutchinson said: ‘I nominated myself straight away - I hated seeing my mum so ill. ‘It was scary but all worthwhile when I woke up and realised I had saved someone’s life. Knowing it's my mum makes it feel even better. ‘Being wheeled down the theatre when there is technically nothing wrong with you was the strangest situation to be in, as normally you're going in to improve your own health.’ After just one week in University Hospital Coventry, Ms Hutchinson is now back at home and recovering. Mrs Hutchinson needed a kidney transplant because she became dependent on dialysis after developing kidney failure. The pair are pictured in hospital before having the surgery . Ms Hutchinson (centre) says she wanted to give her mother (left) a kidney to repay her for giving her the gift of life. The pair are pictured with Ms Hutchinson's sister, Natalie (right) Ms Hutchinson (pictured after the surgery) spent just one week in hospital before being allowed home . She said: ‘I'm recovering really well and my mum came home yesterday too. ‘My mum being ill has changed my life forever, I used to be a typical 21-year-old and went out all the time with friends but now I'd rather spend time with my mum.’ Ten months ago the family were told that a live donor was possible and that Ms Hutchinson was a match, but it took until this month for the operation to go ahead because doctors needed to check the pair were both healthy enough for the operation. Ms Hutchinson said: ‘When we were told it was possible for my mum to have a live donor, I didn't give it a second thought to give my kidney away. I don't need two of them anyway.’ Mrs Hutchinson (pictured after the operation) has a rare condition which occurs after pregnancy when some of the baby's cells remain in the mother's body and her body attacks them .

Image shows Mrs Hutchinson after her operation . Mrs Hutchinson, who works in Asda, suffers from a rare immune condition which is thought to occur after pregnancy. It develops when some cells from the baby remain inside the mother and her body starts to attack them. Ms Hutchinson, who is her mother's carer, has seen first-hand how kidney failure can affect someone's life and is now keen to raise awareness of live donations. She has set up a Facebook page - Our Transplant Journey Millie & Mandy - which has received nearly 3,000 likes. Ms Hutchinson (pictured with her mother) says she used to want to go out with her friends every night but that her mother's illness means she now prefers staying at home with her . Mrs Hutchinson has now also left hospital so mother and daughter are recovering at home together . Her father, Roy, said: ‘I'm just so proud of Millie, it's amazing what she's been able to do for her mum.’ Ms Hutchinson said: ‘It was a scary journey to go through but it was all worth it when I saw how much better she already looks. ‘When we first saw each other after the operation we both cried, it's such an emotional thing to go through but I'd do it all over again for my mum.’","Milissa Hutchinson gave a kidney to her mother, Mandy, on February 14 .

"Former Leicester City, Birmingham and Blackburn Rovers midfielder Robbie Savage has avoided a driving ban for clocking up 99mph on the motorway after his lawyer claimed the pundit is unable to share public transport with football fans who hate him. The 40-year-old, who was caught speeding as he drove home from Alan Shearer's charity ball, will be allowed to continue driving his £230,000 Bentley because it is considered 'a safe haven' for the controversial commentator. Savage could have been banned for up to 28 days but was instead given a meagre £600 fine, despite a possible £2,500 penalty. Robbie Savage has avoided a driving ban despite being caught speeding at 99mph on the motorway . Savage (left) had been driving back from a charity ball hosted by Alan Shearer (right) when he was stopped . Gary Rae, from the charity Brake, told MailOnline: 'It's an insult to those who have lost loved ones because of speeding drivers. 'Driving at such a dangerous speed hardly makes his luxury car a ""safe haven"" for other road users.' The court heard how Savage was caught on the A1 near Knaresborough last month, while driving back in a custom-made Bentley to his home in Prestbury, Cheshire, with his wife Sarah, according to The Sun. The pair had been at Shearer's ball the night beforehand and Savage was driving quickly to get home to his two sons, the court heard. The former Wales captain, who was not in court, was said to be running 'slightly late' after slowing for average speed cameras. Savage (left), pictured during his playing days at Blackburn in 2006, was a hard-tackling midfielder . The midfielder (right) won 39 international caps for Wales - and even captained his country too . Savage's lawyer Philip Morris said that the defendant needed to keep his car because he is in 'regularly accosted in public' due to the nature of his work as a BBC and BT Sport pundit, in which he has to give controversial opinions. The barrister added: 'Someone once described him as being like Marmite. You either love him or the opposite.' He also told the court that Savage relied on family members to look after his children when he was busy because he is too famous to employ a babysitter, according to the Yorkshire Post. The star was given six points for the offence, bringing his total up to nine points, following a previous offence of using his phone at the wheel.Savage must also pay £85 costs and a £60 surcharge. If he had been driving just 1mph faster, Mr Savage would have been forced to attend court in person and would have been extremely likely to face an automatic ban. As well as working for the BBC, the 40-year-old (centre) is now a football pundit for BT sport . A spokesman for Savage refused to comment on the case. The player had a reputation as a hard-tackling midfielder during his career with clubs including Leicester, Birmingham, Blackburn  and Derby County, and attracted fierce opposition from rival fans. He was originally a trainee with Manchester United, but despite being released by the Premier League giant Savage went on to captain Wales, playing 39 times for his country. In 2011, he appeared on Strictly Come Dancing, partnering Ola Jordan, and he now hosts his own football show on BT Sport.

"Danon Edwards, 33, of Syracuse, is accused of breaking a police officer's jaw after punching him at the scene of a traffic accident in May . A former marine who blamed wartime trauma after he was charged with attacking a police officer was a food service specialist who never left the country, it has been reported. Danon Edwards, 33, of Syracuse, is accused of breaking a police officer's jaw after punching him at the scene of a traffic accident in May. In court, Edwards' lawyer said his client's military service from 1999 to 2003 left him emotionally scarred and unable to work. His military records however show during his time in the Marines he was a 'food service specialist', Syracuse.com has reported. The Marines have said they have no records of Edwards being deployed overseas, according to the Associated Press. Authorities allege Edwards hit North Syracuse Officer Robert Florian several times following a four-vehicle crash, which Edwards was involved in. He appeared in court on July 8, where his lawyer Chris Gaiser said his service 'may have had an effect on his emotional stability', according to Syracuse.com. The judge, who had freed Edwards on $50,000 bail, ordered a mental health evaluation for the former marine. He is due to next appear in court on Friday. Last week it was reported that a U.S. Marine veteran jailed in Mexico on weapons charges for allegedly . bringing guns across the border had his first court appearance after . spending more than three months in a Mexican jail. Military records show during his time in the Marines, Edwards was a 'food service specialist' A Mexican judge ordered Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi, 26, to remain behind bars as his case works its way through the Mexican legal system. Sgt Tahmooressi's lawyer told reporters it was unfortunate that his client has to remain behind bars, but that he feels the case is moving in the right direction. Attorney Fernando Benitez, told reporters that irregularities - specifically the fact that his client was not given consular services after his arrest for nearly eight hours - is grounds for a dismissal of the charges.","Danon Edwards is accused of punching officer at scene of traffic accident .

"Eight-year-old Harry Flynn is a lifesaver to his little sister Isabelle - after giving her the kiss of life a staggering 22 times. Little Isabelle, aged two, was born 12 weeks early and suffers with a condition called apnoea of  prematurity, which makes her stop breathing without warning. But quick-thinking Harry has learned how to perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation at the Red Cross Teddy Bears club and regularly steps in to keep his sister alive. Lifesaver: Harry Flynn is pictured with his little sister Isabelle who suffers with apnoea, a condition which stops her breathing suddenly and without any warning. he learned the technique at Red Cross Kids¿ Club . Harry has performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on her while watching TV, during visits to the supermarket and on family days out. Proud Maria says she has 'no doubt' her little daughter would have died had it not been for her big brother. Harry first came to the rescue when the family were watching television and Isabelle cried out before turning blue and falling unconscious. Maria, 37, said: 'It all happened so fast and we were just thinking ‘oh my god, what’s happening.’ 'She just turned blue, then purple, and she was unconscious. She was out cold. But Harry was so cool and calm. He just tapped her leg and called her name and when he got no response he just gave her two breaths and she came round and took an enormous breath. 'We couldn’t believe what we had just seen.' Harry has performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on his sister while watching TV, on family days out and even during visits to the supermarket . Isabelle weighed just 2lbs when she was born at just 28 weeks and was in hospital for 10 weeks before she was able to come home, weighing just 5lbs. She used to stop breathing a couple of times a week but now has an episode around once a month, although doctors say she will eventually grow out of the condition. Apnoea of prematurity is the absence of spontaneous . respiration. It tends to occur in premature babies and occurs because the baby’s central nervous system is . not fully developed when they are born. Most . babies can be roused from an apnoea episode simply by tapping or . rubbing them to make them more alert, and most grow out of the condition as their . body grows and develops. Although apnoea usually resolves itself by the time most premature babies go home, a few will continue to have episodes. In these cases, the baby will be discharged from the intensive care with an apnoea monitor. The child may also need to take caffeine medication for a short time. Harry learned his life-saving skills at the Red Cross Teddy Bears - a youth club he has attended every week since he was five years old. He has saved his sister’s life in supermarkets, out on family trips and even dashes into her bedroom to revive her in her cot if she stops breathing in the middle of the night. Isabelle has a sensor in her mattress that monitors her breathing and sounds an alarm if she stops breathing. 'Harry is always there first,' said Maria. 'He gets to her so fast and he is just so good at it. 'He is so calm and collected and mature beyond his years. He’s amazing - our own hero.' Harry has also trained sister Molly, five, how to revive their little sister in case she ever stops breathing while he or his mum are not around. Full-time mum Maria, who is also a Red Cross volunteer, said: “Once she stopped breathing while we were out shopping in Lidl. 'Before I knew it he had her up out of the trolley, he had to squat down on his knees and held her across his knees giving her breaths. He had to do it about six times. 'I have no doubt she would have died if it were not for Harry. Harry is pictured with his sister Molly, 5, (right) and Isabelle, 2. He has also trained Molly how to revive their little sister in case she ever stops breathing if he or his mother are not nearby . Harry said: 'In the night time, when I hear the [special breathing] alarm go off I run to Isabelle's room and shake her cot and then do a few breaths. I just like to help her' 'They have a really special bond. He absolutely idolises her and dotes on her. He’s a little mother hen really.' But modest Harry - who says he 'just likes to help' - played down his hero status. 'The first time we were just watching telly and Isabelle went all blue and purple on her face,' he said. 'She stopped breathing. I tapped her on the foot twice and did two breaths and she came back. Apnoea of prematurity is the absence of spontaneous . respiration.

In these cases, the baby will be discharged from the intensive care with an apnoea monitor. The child may also need to take caffeine medication for a short time. 'It was a little bit frightening at first but I know what to do.' The toddler most recently stopped breathing last Monday - her second birthday - when the family were out at the amusements. 'She was in a little car and she didn’t want to get out so she started crying and then she held her breath in and she went,” he Harry, of Waterford, Ireland. 'I just shook her and gave her some breaths in her mouth. 'In the night time when I hear the alarm I run to her room and shake her cot and then do a few breaths. I just like to help her.' Staff at the Irish Red Cross - which runs the TeddyBears club - said they were very proud of Harry’s heroic actions. Darren Ryan, chairman of the Irish Red Cross Youth working group, added: 'It is extremely important to see that the courses that we provide, to our youth members and to the public, are effective in that they benefit the wider community. 'Harry’s heroic actions show that first aid training for young people really can make a difference. It also shows the capability of our youth members. 'We couldn’t be prouder of Harry and his story strengthens the Irish Red Cross belief that it is imperative that we offer this kind of training to young people.' Apnoea is the absence of spontaneous respiration. When it happens in premature babies it is called apnoea of prematurity and can happen because the baby’s central nervous system is not fully developed when they are born.

"Accused: Holdsworth-Wild yesterday . A wheelchair-bound equalities advisor for Westminster City Council was snared arranging to have sex with a five-year-old girl and her mother, a court heard yesterday. Andrew Holdsworth-Wild, 58, was allegedly caught red-handed at Victoria station in south-west London with a box of Smarties, a colouring book and train tickets to Maidstone, Kent. He had organised a liaison at a Travelodge with ‘Jo’, an undercover police officer, and her fictional daughter, ‘Chloe’. Covert officers initially made contact with Holdsworth-Wild, who is wheelchair-bound, on the nudist website, True Nudist, last February, jurors were told. The conversations moved to an MSN forum where Holdsworth-Wild said he ‘liked playing, having sex and sexy times’, Southwark Crown Court heard. He also said he would: ‘love to meet up with a family for a nice sexy time’ and liked girls of ‘all ages’. Holdsworth-Wild also met with ‘Jo’ in person on July 6, later sending her a message saying he was ‘horny’. He was arrested at Victoria two weeks later, Southwark Crown Court heard. Holdsworth-Wild has since been dismissed from his position as inclusion and access officer at the council, following an internal investigation. Southwark Crown Court, where Holdsworth-Wild is being tried . ‘This case is about the defendant’s efforts to have sex with a five-year-old girl,’ prosecutor James Norman told the jury. ‘From February 22 to July 21 last year, the defendant made arrangements online and in person to have sexual intercourse with a five-year-old girl. ‘He went to Victoria railway station to meet Jo and Chloe to go to a Travelodge in Maidstone, where he planned to have sex with the girl and her mother. ‘While waiting at the station he bought Smarties, a colouring book and tickets. ‘Fortunately, Chloe does not exist and Jo is an undercover police officer. ‘The people the defendant met at the station were police officers who arrested him.’ Holdsworth-Wild admitted having the conversations with the undercover officers and making the arrangements to visit Kent, Mr Norman said. ‘His case is these discussions were nothing more than fantasies and he never actually intended to have sex with Chloe,’ he added. ‘On February 22, a police officer called Gary made contact with the defendant. ‘Initially that took place on True Nudist website then Gary suggested moving the contact onto MSN chat, so it could be more easily recorded for evidential purposes, unbeknownst to the defendant.’ ‘It’s obvious the defendant thought he was talking to a fellow paedophile,’ Mr Norman said. ‘There is absolutely no doubt looking at those exchanges that the defendant has a sexual interest in children.’ Wearing a dark green blazer, white collarless shirt and black trousers and shoes, Holdsworth-Wild was allowed to remain outside the dock due to his disability. Holdsworth-Wild, of Yew Tree Court, Chy Hwel, Truro, Cornwall, denies a single count of arranging the commission of a child sex offence. The trial continues.

"It was on October 1, 1996 that a relatively unknown Frenchman called Arsene Wenger was unveiled at Highbury as the new manager of Arsenal. His appointment was, it's fair to say, greeted with a mixture of bemusement and incredulity. One newspaper ran the back page headline 'Arsene Who?' But little did we know then that Wenger's arrival would herald the start of one of the most glorious chapters in the club's history. In the 18 years since, he has delivered three Premier League titles, five FA Cups and reached a Champions League final. To commemorate the anniversary, here's our rundown - in no particular order - of the greatest players of the Wenger era. Dennis Bergkamp . Dennis Bergkamp scores against Leicester at Highbury in the Premier League . The Dutch master was already at Highbury when Wenger arrived but the Frenchman transformed him into an influential forward. Bergkamp contributed memorable goals - who can forget that hat-trick at Leicester City or the pirouette at Newcastle - and was excellent for a decade, scoring 120 goals in 423 matches. Thierry Henry . Thierry Henry scores a penalty for Arsenal against Charlton during his first spell at the club . The Frenchman had played under Wenger at Monaco and they were reunited for £11m in August 1999. Henry quickly established himself as a world class forward and a club legend, scoring 92 goals and powering them to the Premier League title in 2002 and 2004. He was also voted PFA Players' Player of the Year in consecutive years. Patrick Vieira . Patrick Vieira avoids the challenge of Valencia's Pablo Aimar during a Champions League game . Wenger's enforcer through the glory years, Vieira is undoubtedly one of the best midfielders of modern times and has won pretty much every trophy on offer. He was a man who never shirked a tackle and inspired Arsenal to victory in countless important games during his nine ever-present seasons. Nicolas Anelka . Nicolas Anelka scores Arsenal's third goal against Manchester United in the Charity Shield . Considering Anelka joined as a 17-year-old for just £500,000, his return of 28 goals, the Premier League and the FA Cup isn't at all bad. Though his time at Highbury was short-lived, and included a few little dramas, he was a prolific scorer at the time for the Gunners. Emmanuel Petit . French midfielder Emmanuel Petit powers past two Dynamo Kiev defenders in the Champions League . Another man who played under Wenger at Monaco, midfielder Petit arrived for £2.5m in June 1997. That proved a bargain as his consistent performances helped Arsenal win the Double in 1998 and he formed a formidable partnership with Vieira.. Marc Overmars . Marc Overmars avoids a challenge from Chelsea's Didier Deschamps during a Premier League game in 1999 . The scarily fast Dutch winger was a key member of the Double-winning side and memorably scored the crucial goal at Old Trafford that turned the tide in the title race. He contributed 40 goals in all for the Gunners - not bad for a winger - and left innumerable full backs terrified at the thought of facing him. Tony Adams . Tony Adams and Arsene Wenger celebrate winning the Premier League in 1998 . Stalwart Adams was already part of the furniture at Highbury long before Wenger arrived but the manager got five more seasons out of the 30-year-old. He captained the team to Doubles in 1998 and 2002, sealing his legendary status at the club he represented with distinction in a career spanning three decades. Martin Keown . Martin Keown beats Ruud van Nistelrooy to the ball during a defeat against Manchester United . Another pillar in that formidable Nineties Arsenal back line, Keown was actually largely out of favour during the 1998 Double season, playing only 18 times in the league. But he soon regained his place and was integral for a few more seasons, signing off with a title winners' medal as part of the Invincibles team. Lauren . Right back Lauren was described by Arsene Wenger as his greatest ever signing . The versatile Cameroonian was one of Wenger's most under-rated but valuable signings, arriving for £7.2m in the summer of 2000. After taking a little time to find his place in the team, Lauren became an indispensible part of both the 2002 Double winners and the Invincibles. David Seaman . David Seaman was a stalwart for Arsene Wenger's sides during the 1990s and early 2000s . Long-established as Arsenal's No 1, Wenger rightly saw no reason to remove Seaman when he arrived at the club. The keeper continued to excel, and was vital in all the Gunners' triumphs during the early Wenger era. He was capable of making seemingly impossible saves, notably the one to keep out Paul Peschisolido's header against Sheffield United in the 2003 FA Cup semi-final. Aaron Ramsey . Aaron Ramsey has recovered from a serious injury to become one of Arsenal's most important players . It's only right to include a member of the successful team Wenger is currently trying to mould at Arsenal and Ramsey would certainly be the choice of many. The Welshman has really kicked on over the last two seasons, scoring a lot of goals and turning in consistently influential displays. He was the club's player of the season in 2013-2014 and capped it with the winning goal in the FA Cup final, ending the club's embarrassing nine-year trophy drought. Cesc Fabregas . Cesc Fabregas left Barcelona for Arsenal and then returned to Spain in 2011 . One of Wenger's biggest success stories, taking a rough diamond of a 16-year-old from Barcelona and turning him into a dynamic midfielder and club captain. Fabregas had the Spanish flair and the grit required to succeed in the Premier League and Arsenal were sorry to see him return home in 2011. Ashley Cole . Ashely Cole established himself as one of the best left backs in the world at Arsenal before leaving in 2006 . The youth graduate who became the best left back in the world, Cole may have been more successful at Chelsea but he was made at Arsenal. He won the Premier League twice and the FA Cup three times, making 228 first-team appearances in all. His rampaging runs down the left side and crossing, not to mention his tireless defensive work, were vital during the Invincibles season. Robert Pires . French midfielder Robert Pires holds of Tottenham's Robbie Keane during a London derby in 2006 . Arsenal fought off competition from Real Madrid and Juventus to sign the elegant French attacker Pires and he was worth it. Imperious during the 2001-2002 Double season, he created more goals than anyone else in the league. His polished technique, passing and finishing skills were also very much in evidence during the Invincible years. Robin van Persie . The sight of Robin van Persie celebrating was a familiar one during his eight seasons at Arsenal . One of the most prolific strikers of the Wenger era, Van Persie scored 132 goals in 277 matches during his eight seasons at the club. Arriving from Feyenoord in 2004 for a mere £2.75m, the Dutchman wasted little time in showing his predatory instinct and was particularly impressive in the 2008-2009 (20 goals) and 2011-2012 (37) seasons. Sol Campbell . Signed on a free transfer from Tottenham, Sol Campbell went onto become a legend at Arsenal . His transfer from rivals Spurs in 2001 certainly ruffled a few feathers but Campbell dispelled all criticism by winning the Premier League and FA Cup in his first season. A natural successor to the retiring Adams and Keown, Campbell produced regular commanding performances at the heart of the Arsenal defence. Freddie Ljungberg . Freddie Ljungberg scores for Arsenal against Panathinaikos in the Champions League in 2004 . His £3m fee back in 1998 was a Swedish record but it proved a bargain for Wenger. Ljungberg scored and created many important goals during the Double season and filled many roles across the midfield and in attack. He made in excess of 300 appearances for the club, winning two league titles and three FA Cups. Ray Parlour . Ray Parlour is tackled by Toony Taggart of Barnet during a pre-season friendly . The ultimate 'unsung hero', Parlour put in scores of pivotal performances for Wenger's teams. He stunned Chelsea with a 30-yard goal in the 2002 FA Cup final and captained the side to a 5-1 win over Inter Milan in the San Siro. He made 339 league appearances for the club between 1992 and 2004. Like our Arsenal Facebook page. VIDEO Wenger celebrates 18 years at Arsenal .

"Created: . 23:04 EST, 26 February 2015 . This is the moment a benefits cheat was caught on camera lugging around wood which weighed more than seven stone - despite pocketing £30,000 in state handouts because he was 'too sick to work'. Mark Barnes, 60, from Bacup, Lancashire, received an annual £30,000 in benefits over a seven-year period after claiming he was unable to work due to a debilitating illness. But, after an anonymous tip-off, investigators found Barnes was secretly working as a woodcutter, while still receiving income support, council tax benefit and employment support allowance. Scroll down for video . This is the moment a benefits cheat who pocketed £30,000 in state handouts by claiming he was too sick to work for seven years was caught lugging firewood weighing more than seven stone . Mark Barnes, 60, from Bacup, Lancashire, received nearly £30,000  each year after claiming he was unable to work due to a debilitating illness . Officers for the Department for Work and Pension set up a camera at his work and covertly filmed Barnes chopping up the wood, before lugging it off into a container. The wood, which he then sold on to a local garden centre, was estimated to weigh more than seven-and-a-half stone, according to the Daily Mirror. Burnley Crown Court heard how Barnes sold on the kindling, making £70 cash per week. He told government officials that he thought he was entitled to earn the money while still claiming the handouts, the court heard. Barnes admitted two charges of dishonestly failing to promptly notify a change in circumstances. He also admitted making a false representation for job seekers' allowance to Rossendale Council in October 2013. After an anonymous tip-off, investigators from the Department for Work and Pensions found Barnes was secretly working as a woodcutter . Prosecutor Claire Thomas said Barnes had claimed benefits since February 2000 for himself and two children. After claiming he could not work through illness, he  made declarations to the DWP when his son started work, but never told the department he too was working. There was no claim for compensation as the department plans to start civil proceedings to recover the money, the court heard. Officers for the Department for Work and Pensions then filmed him chopping up wood, before lugging sacks of it into a container, ready to be sold on . Barnes admitted two charges of dishonestly failing to promptly notify a change in circumstances, initially for income support and later employment support allowance, and council tax benefit . Richard Dawson, defending, said: 'It is own foolishness that has placed him in the position that he now finds himself. If he explained his situation then he might well have been entitled to certain benefits.' He was given a 12-month community order and 200 hours unpaid work after admitting to failing to notify the authorities about his job. Judge Andrew Long said: 'I am not unsympathetic to your situation. You are a man of previous good character and you showed some nous in getting yourself some work. 'But it was dishonest in that you didn't notify the department. It may well be if you had been honest then you would have received benefits of some sort or other.'","Mark Barnes, 60, from Bacup, Lancashire, raked in nearly £30,000 per year .

"Booby-trapped Soviet weapon caches which date back to the Cold War are probably still buried across Britain, a top historian has claimed. Professor Christopher Andrew, an expert on the history of the intelligence services, made the claim after a secret archive released today revealed the location of several arms dumps across Europe. Soviet spies dug the stores under trees and farmland near major cities, and filled them with small arms and communications devices in case undercover agents needed to defend themselves. Treasure hunt: Soviet weapons caches just outside Rome, Italy, are detailed in the Mitrokhin Archive, parts of which have been revealed for the first time today. An expert said there are bound to be similar stores in Britain . Their existence is detailed in the Mitrokhin Archive, a collection of thousands of Soviet intelligence documents compiled by a defector and made public for the first time today. Disillusioned KGB Major Vasili Mitrokhin amassed the collection over more than a decade before walking into the British embassy in Latvia in 1992 shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union. Defector: KGB Major Vasili Mitrokhin walked into the British embassy in Latvia with a vast trove of files . Those who saw him said he looked like a . homeless man and he had buried the files, described as one of the . greatest hauls in British history, under dirty underwear in his . suitcase. In the notes stored at Cambridge's Churchill Archives Centre, Mitrokhin - who died in 2004 - described the locations in incredible detail along with booby traps. Describing a stash near Berne, Switzerland, he wrote directions to a chapel near a farm and added: 'After taking 36 steps, you will be at the point between two large leafy trees, the only ones in the sector. 'The distance between the trees is three paces... The area between the trees has been used for the cache.' A map included in the archive pinpointed three sites, named Kollo, Fosso and Bor, around Rome. And another note provided instructions on how to disarm an explosive booby trap called Molniya or Lightning. It . read: 'When digging out the container from the earth, take care not to . strike the handle by chance. 'The handle must only be turned and the . container tilted and taken out of the hole after the explosive device . has been disarmed.' Some of the caches have since been uncovered, but many are likely to remain today, said Prof Andrew, a friend of Mitrokhin who has written two books about his vast trove of documents. Although the archive does not detail caches on British soil, Professor Andrew insisted they must exist. 'This was a large scale operation and the caches were strategically placed in most Nato countries during the Cold War,' he said. Handwritten: The KGB Major's notes (pictured) described the location of weapons stores in intricate detail . Trove: A list of Soviet agents operating abroad (left) is contained within the newly-released files (right) 'Given that Britain was second only to the United States in terms of importance to the Soviets at this time, it would be remarkable if this tactic wasn't deployed here.' However, those hoping to lay their hands on a dangerous piece of history would be disappointed, Prof Andrew said. He explained: 'Of course by now they would not be easy to find and it is unlikely the weapons would be serviceable.'","Files compiled by KGB Major Vasili Mitrokhin, who moved to UK in 1992 .

"Some politicians come under fire for being corrupt or incompetent, but Belgium's new Minister of Public Health is the first political figure to come under fire for being too fat for the job. Maggie De Block - who is Belgium's most popular politician and was once tipped as a future premier - surprised many when it was announced she would take up the role of Health Minister in the centre-right coalition which has just taken office. The 52-year-old, who weighs in at more than 20 stone, was not considered to be exactly setting a good example in a country where obesity is a growing health problem. Scroll down for video . Prejudice? Maggie De Block, Belgium's new Minister of Public Health. Her suitability for the role has been questioned because of her weight. The country is facing a growing obesity problem . Defiant: The politician has shrugged off the criticism, pointing to her experience as both a GP and a minister in the nation's previous government . The anti-Maggie charge was led by Tom van de Weghe, a Washington-based correspondent for Belgium's VRT television station. In a tweet he questioned whether she would be 'credible' in her new post. NOS, a top Dutch TV channel, likened her to a larger-than-life figure from a Rubens painting and said her 'obvious corpulence' would cause 'sniggering.' But Ms De Block, who practised medicine as a GP for 25 years, has shrugged off the criticism. Merit: Ms De Block urged her countrymen to look beyond her appearance when deciding if she was an able and effective politician . 'I know I'm not a model but you have to see what's inside, not the packaging,' she said. According to the World Health Organization data from 2008, a total of 47 per cent of the adult population in Belgium were overweight. As Minister for Immigration in the last Belgian government she was praised for slashing the number of asylum requests by almost half, from 27,000 per year to 15,000. She was unmoved by hunger strikes and sent in the police to end them and to ensure that expulsion orders were  carried out.","Maggie De Block - a former GP - has deflected comments about her weight .

"Astronomers have been left baffled by the rise and subsequent fall of a huge feature in a sea on Saturn’s moon Titan. In July 2012 a giant feature 100 square miles (260 square kilometres) in area - roughly the area of 58,000 football fields - is seen surfacing from under the liquid before partially disappearing again. No definitive explanation is yet apparent but it could be a surface wave, rising bubbles or even a solid object just below the surface. In this series of images from the Cassini spacecraft the giant object 100 square miles (260 square kilometres) in size is seen rising out of one of Titan's largest seas before disappearing again. In the latest image on the right the object still seems to be partially submerged beneath the surface . The feature was spotted by Nasa’s Cassini spacecraft, which is currently in orbit around the Saturnian system. It was spotted in Ligeia Mare, one of the largest seas on Titan, and was observed by Cassini’s radar experiment. In images from 10 July 2012 to 21 August 2014 the feature is shown rising and then falling below the surface. With its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a frozen version of Earth several billion years ago, before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere. Because Titan is smaller than Earth, its gravity doesn’t hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly, so the atmosphere extends 370 miles (595 kilometres) into space. As on Earth, the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that comes with the seasons, although the seasons on Titan are about seven Earth years long. Titan's ‘water’ is liquid methane, CH4, better known on Earth as natural gas. Regular Earth-water, H2O, would be frozen solid on Titan where the surface temperature is -180°C (-292°F). With Titan's low gravity and dense atmosphere, methane raindrops could grow twice as large as Earth's raindrops. As well as this, they would fall more slowly, drifting down like snowflakes. But scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades. A comparison image from 26 April 2007 shows how no similar feature was previously spotted in that region. The mysterious feature appears bright in the radar images, suggesting it has a somewhat similar composition to the land nearby in the image. This supports one theory that it may be a solid structure - potentially an island - that surfaced from under the liquid before sinking again for an unknown reason. The dark area in the image is the liquid hydrocarbon sea on Titan’s surface, while the bright area is land. Scientists on the radar team are confident that the feature is not an artifact - or flaw - in their data. They have also ruled out the possibility of it being due to evaporation, as the nearby shoreline has not changed much. Several theories currently exist including surface waves, rising bubbles, floating solids, solids suspended just below the surface or ‘something more exotic’ according to Nasa. When asked for further comment by MailOnline the agency was yet to respond. Speaking to MailOnline Professor of Planetary Plasma Physics Emma Bunce from the University of Leicester, who also works on the Cassini mission, said it may have been some sort of iceberg akin to something we see on Earth. ‘It could be something floating that sunk and came back to the surface,’ she says. ‘I was thinking almost like an iceberg, similar to something in Earth’s oceans.’ But she doesn’t rule out the possibility of it being some sort of giant bubble, or even surface waves. She goes on to explain that the feature may have arisen due to the change in season at Saturn. The first image in 2007 was taken ‘around Saturn equinox [when the sun is above the equator], and then the latest image is now heading towards northern summer solstice on Saturn. ‘That’s sort of an ongoing theme for a lot of the Cassini results; a lot of things depend on the season at Saturn as it moves in orbit. ‘Because this lake itself is actually near to Titan’s northern pole, perhaps it is something to do with illumination conditions.' A comparison image from 26 April 2007 (left) shows how no similar feature was previously spotted in that region. The feature was spotted by Nasa’s Cassini spacecraft, which is currently in orbit around the Saturnian system. On the right is an image of Titan in orbit around Saturn . The feature was spotted in Ligeia Mare (shown), one of the largest seas on Titan, and was observed by Cassini’s radar experiment. Several theories currently exist including surface waves, rising bubbles, floating solids, solids suspended just below the surface or ‘something more exotic’ according to Nasa . The appearance of the feature may also be due to changing seasons on Titan, with summer drawing near in the moon’s northern hemisphere. Monitoring these changes is a major goal of Cassini’s current extended mission. ‘Science loves a mystery, and with this enigmatic feature, we have a thrilling example of ongoing change on Titan,’ said Dr Stephen Wall, the deputy team lead of Cassini's radar team, based at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. ‘We're hopeful that we'll be able to continue watching the changes unfold and gain insights about what's going on in that alien sea.’ It's not just Titan that is thought to have an active surface; earlier this month scientists found the first sign of geologic activity on a solar system world other than Earth - Europa. Experts from the University of Idaho and the Johns Hopkins University, Maryland, say Europa could be more Earth-like than experts imagined. The latest find appears to solve a puzzle that has perplexed planetary scientists. It shows where old crust was destroyed and how the icy crust is expanding. Many parts of Europa’s surface show evidence of extension, where wide bands - up to tens of miles wide - formed as the surface ripped apart, and fresh icy material from the underlying shell moved into the newly created gap, a process akin to terrestrial seafloor spreading, according to the study published in the journal Nature Geoscience. Europa’s surface is considered to be relatively young at between 40 and 90 millions of years old, which can perhaps now be explained by plate tectonics. It has been a decade since Cassini entered orbit around Saturn (illustration shown). In June the Cassini mission celebrated 10 years of exploring the planet, its rings and moons. It arrived for a four-year mission but has since been continuously extended, although it will almost certainly end in 2017 .","Astronomers at Nasa in California have been left baffled by the appearance of a huge feature in one of Titan's largest seas .

"Ohio State University fired the director of its celebrated marching band on Thursday after determining he ignored a 'sexualized' culture of rituals including students being pressured to march in their underwear and participate in sexually themed stunts. Jonathan Waters had led the band since 2012, and served in lesser capacities for a decade before that. His halftime shows for what's known to fans as 'The Best Damn Band in the Land' were considered revolutionary and drew millions of viewers on YouTube. Ohio State President Michael Drake, on the job just three weeks, said that he was 'profoundly disappointed and shocked' by the findings of a two-month investigation that began before his arrival. Scroll down for video . Ohio State University marching band director Jon Waters (pictured last November). OSU on Thursday fired Waters amid allegations he knew about and ignored 'serious cultural issues' including sexual harassment . 'This is 2014, and we respect our students as young adults,' Drake said. 'We respect women, and we respect all the different people who work with us, we respect that diversity. We just had to make a square-wave change between this report, which was unacceptable, and the future, which we start today.' The probe determined Waters knew about and failed to stop what the university called 'serious cultural issues' within the band. Email and phone messages were left for Waters and the band alumni association seeking comment. In the report, Waters denies the allegations against him — including that he texted sexual limericks to band members — and disagrees that the band's culture is sexualized. He said the culture was evolving, while suggesting to investigators 'that sexual innuendo is found in much of what college students do.' A spokesman said the university was required to promptly perform the probe under federal Title IX sexual discrimination laws, after a parent complained band members were asked to swear secrecy oaths 'about objectionable traditions and customs,' some in place well before Waters took over. Those included raunchy songs and a late-night march, described as optional, in which band members stripped down to their underwear. Investigators found band staff and directors, including Waters, had sometimes attended. One female student said older members of the band would warn newcomers to wear 'fuller coverage' undergarments for the event; others wore pajamas or shorts, but some marched naked. In the report, assistant Director . Michael Smith said he didn't believe it when he saw it. An associate . band director, Christopher Hech, said he recalled a student having . alcohol poisoning at the event some years ago. The . report also described students earning sexually themed nicknames based . on tasks other band members assigned them: One female student had to . pretend to have an orgasm while sitting on the lap of her brother, a . fellow band member and was given the nickname 'squirt', according to DeadSpin. The site also claims that two female band members rubbed their breasts together and were nicknamed 'Jewoobs' and 'Tiggles'. Others pretended to be sex toys, prostitutes or . body parts. Waters was aware of some students' nicknames and allegedly . used them 'when he was upset,' witnesses said, but he's also reported to . have advised students against the monikers. Drake, . the university's first black president, said he wants to see the band . get beyond such activities and carry on its tradition of excellence. 'There are an infinite number of ways that people can bond that are not really demeaning and anachronistic,' he said. 'The greatest job in the world': Waters began with the band during college and rose through the ranks before being named director in 2012 . The . university has appointed former Ohio Attorney General Betty Montgomery . to lead an independent task force assigned to review the matter, which . will include representatives from Ernst & Young, the Sports Conflict . Institute and outside counsel to provide guidance on Title IX . compliance. Waters started . in the band as an undergraduate, playing sousaphone all four years . during college. He graduated in 2000 and became a graduate assistant . with the band, its assistant director and then interim director under . Jon Woods, who retired after 25 years. Waters told an OSU Alumni Club . gathering in Chillicothe in March his was 'the greatest job in America.' His firing was first reported by The Columbus Dispatch. During . his tenure, Waters revolutionized the band's halftime shows through the . use of iPads instead of paper, allowing students to morph into the . shapes of horses, superheroes and dinosaurs galloping, flying and . tromping across the field. Its technological advances landed the band in . an Apple commercial in January. One performance in which the band takes . the shape of a moonwalking Michael Jackson has more than 10 million . views on YouTube. Drake said . band staff is working this week to carry the band season forward . smoothly as a new director is found. Members of the 225-member band are . scheduled to perform this weekend with the Columbus Symphony, in an . annual event considered the unofficial start of its season.","Jonathan Waters fired as director of Ohio State University marching band .

"The England rugby team will have the weight of the nation on their shoulders at the World Cup 2015 on home soil, but they will at least know that a herbal cocoon body wrap will be close to hand. With all things going to plan, the Stuart Lancaster-coached hosts could spend the preparations for all but one game at the World Cup - a group A match in Manchester - in their favoured  headquarters at Pennyhill Park in Surrey. Chris Robshaw and his team-mates will be based at the Bagshot facility and have access to not just the expertly kept football pitch but The Spa, where whatever body or beauty treatment they could possibly desire will be found.

The gym is fully equipped for elite athletes with Technogym equipment, each with its own entertainment system, and a Junckers sprung exercise studio. There's also a wide range of classes such as pilates, yoga and aqua aerobics if they're up for some 'extras'. If it's outdoor relaxation that's required, the nine-hole golf course, pools and hot tubs should do the trick.

Extra comfort: One of the bathroom designs, Silver Berch, has two free standing white volcanic limestone baths with a Champagne chiller between them and a large flat screen television recessed into the wall . Dining wise, haute cuisine may not be on the menu for the burly rugby players mid-tournament but it's on offer for the rest of us at two deluxe restaurants - two Michein-starred The Latymer, with chef Michael Wignall, and the more laid-back Brasserie. No worries about England's chargers not getting a good rest between matches either, with the five-star accommodation extending to hand-crafted mattresses and a pillow menu in each individually designed room. But there could be a worry of them becoming a little too precious with their underfloor heated bathrooms, oversized shower heads and side rain bars. The country mansion-styled Ascot Bar is perfect place for a tipple at the end of the day also.

Party officials say the covers are weakened by motorists driving over them and they are more than strong enough to bear the weight of ordinary pedestrians - who should realise 'this isn't something to walk on' In the latest incident, Chinese woman Qiao Tsao, 43, hurt her leg when a manhole cover broke. She managed to avoid falling all the way down the hole by grabbing onto the side and being helped out by other pedestrians. Local media said that the thin plastic covers are no more than 7mm thick, and that there have been several incidents where they have broken after people walked on them. Party officials in Nanjing however have defended the decision to use the plastic covers. Local party spokesman Kuan-Yin Cheng, 46, said: 'The plastic lids are thin but they have steel bars through them which means they are more than enough to bear the weight of an ordinary pedestrian. 'The accidents happened by people illegally driving their cars onto the pavement which weakened the lids, causing these accidents.' The manhole covers look similar to metal alternatives, except they are coloured bright green or blue . Although they have metal bars running through them, they are very flimsy and usually only 7mm thick . He said that in areas where there was a danger the cars could possibly drive onto the pavement the plastic lids would be replaced but there were still deemed perfectly okay as long as it was only pedestrians that crossed over them. He added: 'They are made in brightly coloured material so people really should realise that this isn't something to walk on although if they do we don't anticipate problems under normal conditions.'","At least three people have fallen into manholes after their cheap plastic covers broke when trod on .

"A British medical student suspected of plotting with Islamic State announced ‘I smell war’ just hours before he was arrested. Tarik Hassane, 21, known to friends as ‘The Surgeon’, was being questioned last night over allegations he wanted to bring terror to the streets of Britain. He was Tasered by armed police who stormed a relative’s flat where he was sleeping after flying into the country. The devout Muslim, studying in Sudan, is suspected of travelling to Syria and conspiring with the brutal terror group. Three of his friends, all aged 20 or 21, were also held by Scotland Yard counter-terrorism officers. Magistrates have granted police an extra five days to question four men arrested on suspicion of plotting a terrorist attack on the UK, the Met said this morning. Scroll down for video . Operation: Police and MI5 stormed the flat where Tarik Hassane was staying, throwing in stun grenades, before arresting a terror suspect . Officers kicked in the property's door, threw in three stun grenades and then Tasered Hassane before arresting him at 4.30am . First picture: This is Tarik Hassane, who tweeted this picture of his ID card from medical school in Sudan . Geography: Hassane's arrest was a street away from where two of the 21/7 bombers were held in 2005. There is no suggestion of any link between the two . These grabs from amateur footage taken at the scene show a police van in Dalgarno Gardens, west London . One of them, Gusai Abuzeid, 21, a student at the Greenwich School of Management and part-time Primark worker, was arrested at home in Central London. His brother said his sibling was not religious and could not be involved in an Islamist plot. One line of inquiry is that the men were plotting a beheading to emulate hostage murderer Jihadi John. Hassane was arrested on Tuesday on the Princess Alice Estate, West London, where two of the July 21 bombers were found nine years ago. Armed police searched flats occupied by his aunt and uncle. One witness heard ‘three bangs’ before he was dragged out. She said: ‘His face was belligerent, angry, not at all remorseful and a complete look of hate.’ Hours earlier, the suspect tweeted that he had flown into the country, adding: ‘Oi lads … I smell war.’ He has been at the University of Medical Sciences and Technology in Khartoum since September 2013. Security services believe that he has travelled to Syria and met with hard-line militants there. Hassane is of Moroccan and Saudi Arabian heritage and was educated at Westminster City School. Teachers made him a ‘maths ambassador’ and he wrote award-winning poetry about his passion for football. Police are seen escorting the suspect away after he was Tasered. He was uninjured, Scotland Yard said . Raid: Counter-terrorism officers carry belongings from the flat raided where 'The Surgeon' Tarik Hassane was arrested . Police smashed down the door and threw in stun grenades as they held four young men in separate raids . Arrest: Medical student Tarik Hassane was Tasered and arrested at a flat in Princess Alice House in west London, the damaged door can be seen on the right side of the first floor . Princess Alice house on Dalgano Way in London, where officers swooped . But neighbours said he later hung around with North Africans who pushed him towards extremist views. His family hoped he would study at prestigious King’s College London, but he failed to get the grades. He is a prolific user of social media, where he has condemned women for wearing make-up. He posted that so many friends had died in Syria ‘there needs to be an In the Hearts of Green Birds specifically for West London’ – a reference to a Bosnian video that celebrated ‘martyrs’ with pictures of their dead bodies. He has also urged Muslims to pray for jihadi fighters. The brother of the second suspect said a ‘police SWAT team’ smashed into their flat hours after they had watched TV terror drama Homeland. Arrests: Scotland Yard has held four men in London over alleged terrorism offences . Adai Abuzeid said six of his family, including his grandmother and father, a refugee from Libya, were forced to the floor. He said: ‘I looked at Gusai, using my eyes to ask what was going on. He looked baffled – that’s how I know he hasn’t done anything ... He’s working hard to make something of his life. I can’t believe he’s been arrested – it doesn’t make sense. ‘If anything, he’s not really a Muslim – he doesn’t pray. He’s not political either. Our whole family is against what is going on out there.’ Mr Abuzeid said his brother had known Hassane since primary school, but they had ‘drifted apart’. Officers said one suspect had to be shot with a Taser during the arrests, but did not require medical treatment . Last night, Scotland Yard Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said the ‘drumbeat around terrorism has changed’. He said: ‘We are having to be more interventionist and a lot of it is linked back to Syria and Iraq. These are arrests that in some way or other have got that sort of link.’ Whitehall officials said the move may have ‘foiled the early stages’ of a planned attack. The men, arrested under the Terrorism Act on suspicion of being involved in the commission, preparation or instigation of terrorism, can be held for 14 days. One expert warned ‘around 1,000’ young British men have flown to Syria to fight. Raffaello Pantucci, of the Royal United Services Institute, said many are ‘excited’ by IS propaganda. News of the raids comes after terrorist Omar Hussain, a former Morrisons worker, last week urged British Islamists to launch attacks . Former Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg yesterday said he offered to negotiate with IS to free Alan Henning - but the foreign office turned him down. Mr Begg suggested he knew the terrorists. In response, the Prime Minister said: 'We are very happy to work with anybody. My understanding is that Moazzam Begg did make some appeals, sadly, as we know, those appeals fell on deaf ears . . . 'But if Moazzam Begg has information to provide about who these people are, he should provide it.' Mr Begg is a controversial figure who, until last week, was awaiting trial on seven terror charges relating to Syria. The case against him was dropped after new intelligence from MI5. In yesterday's interview, on BBC Radio Four's Today programme, he declined to say he wished for the destruction of IS – but insisted he could have helped in the case of Mr Henning.

"Historians believe they have raised England's only surviving 'state pirate ship' from the bottom of the Thames estuary after 400 years. Most of the time the Cherabin led an honest existence, trading between England and Turkey for the Levant Company before it sank fully-laden in a storm in 1603. But behind this peaceful image lay a sinister double life - plundering other nations' traders in 'terrorist' raids which were signed and sealed by the High Court of Admiralty. Find: Historians believe they have raised England's only surviving 'state pirate ship' from the bottom of the Thames estuary after 400 years. The wreck (pictured) was found 10 years ago with few clues to its identity . Historic: The wreck was rediscovered in the Thames estuary near Herne Bay, Kent, and is believed to have sunk during a fierce storm in 1603 as it left London fully-laden with goods to trade with the rest of the world . Huge: The ship was left in pieces but originally weighed 160 tons and measured 80ft long and 25ft wide . The Cherabin was one of 70 'privateers' - state pirate ships - which stole £97,000 under the reign of Elizabeth I, more than the famous pirates of the south west put together. The spoils were then divided between rich English sponsors and the courts, which claimed a hefty cut of the winnings as a tax. In the case of the Cherabin, the ship travelled to the Azores to steal more than £2,000 in unspecified 'prizes', sugar, hides, ginger, sarsaparilla and brazilwood. Much of the treasure was owned by merchants from Spain, with whom England was fighting a war that was never formally declared. Until now historians believed they had never found the remains of any privateers, most of which met grisly ends on the high seas. Dr Gustav Milne said the ship likely 'led the double-life of honest trader and ruthless privateer' But that changed after a 400-year-old vessel was dug up from the bed of the Thames estuary a decade ago in what researchers described as the biggest find since the Mary Rose. After 10 years painstakingly combing over the ship's mud-caked artefacts and disintegrating beams, archaeologists now say they have strong clues it and the Cherabin were one and the same. Dr Gustav Milne, an honorary senior lecturer at University College London's Institute of Archaeology who led the project, said the similarities were striking. Both ships were a similar size and age, both sank fully-laden as they left London, both were armed merchantmen, and both had evidence which pointed to them losing their sails and rudders. 'I think there's a very good chance that the Gresham Ship was actually the Cherabin', said Dr Milne. 'We know the Cherabin was drifting in a peculiar way because it lost its rudder and sails. Interestingly we didn't find a rudder and our ship was strangely orientated on the sea bed. 'If our wreck is indeed the Cherabin, then it probably is the first merchantman of that era yet recovered that led the double-life of honest trader and ruthless privateer. 'Privateering was state-sponsored terrorism formally sanctioned by the High Court of Admiralty, conducted by merchant and private shipping on the high seas - and therefore lying outside the contemporary definition of a declaration of all-out war between two sovereign states. 'In effect, England declared war on Spain without declaring war on Spain, not using expensive armies and avoiding invasions and unwinnable land battles, but by using privately-owned ships sponsored by private backers who would get a cut of the ""profits"". 'The rest was then collected by the High Court of Admiralty as a ""tax"".' Reign: The Cherabin was one of 70 'privateers' - state pirate ships - which stole £97,000 under Elizabeth I . Study: Divers helped raise the ship's skeleton from the murky waters around Girdler Sand near Herne Bay, Kent, and brought it to Portsmouth before samples were sent to be studied in Denmark and London . Big job: A workman carefully unloads one of the huge sections which was raised from the Thames estuary . Fragile: The wreck could not be kept out of the water for long because it would begin to decay in the air . Careful study: Like the Cherabin, the Gresham ship was aligned unusually on the sea bed (pictured in diagram) The historians make clear that they will never be completely sure if they have the right ship. Port records from the year of the Cherabin's sinking, which would have included its cargo and other details, did not survive and the remains are too disintegrated to prove its origin conclusively. But details of its final days were recorded partially in court records, because its owner brought legal action over the sinking after he claimed the estuary channels were not properly marked out. And the historians insist the remains were the most important find since the Mary Rose was raised from the Solent in 1982, after 437 years. The wreck was originally rediscovered by the Duke of Wellington in the 1840s, whose men found and melted down 2,700 lead ingots, iron guns and lead for money without a second thought for its history. Significant: Historians described the find as the biggest since the raising of the Mary Rose (pictured), the flagship of Henry VII's fleet which sank in the Solent in 1545. But it was much more typical of ships of the time . Similarities: Researchers said the ship was similar to Sir Francis Drake's Golden Hinde (replica shown) Clues: The wreck was named the Gresham Ship after the initials of Elizabethan businessman and scholar Thomas Gresham were found on one of its 7ft cast iron guns. He helped found the Royal Exchange in 1571 . Cannon: An emblem of a grasshopper on the gun. The ship's timbers were felled in 1574, historians believe . A crucial part of Naval warfare from the 1500s to the 1800s, 'privateers' differed from pirates in only one way: they were backed by the state. During the 19-year Anglo-Spanish War, which was never formally declared despite the famed battle with the Spanish Armada of 1588, privateers proved a crucial weapon to undermine the enemy. The ships would sail near the Caribbean and Spanish coasts, trying to intercept the treasures of their rivals to assert England's dominance. Their methods were every bit as merciless as those of conventional pirates, but their legitimacy meant their captains had no need to fear arrest when they returned home. England was not alone - every developed nation was every bit as ruthless as every other. After that, the ship's existence was largely forgotten until workmen for the Port of London Authority were dredging the Thames estuary in 2003 to build a £1.5billion container port in Tilbury, Essex. Divers helped raise the ship's skeleton from the murky waters around Girdler Sand near Herne Bay, Kent, and brought it to Portsmouth before samples were sent to be studied in Denmark and at University College London. Over several years historians confirmed they had found an armed 16th Century merchant ship, weighing 160 tons and measuring 80ft long and 25ft wide with a 60ft keel. Its timbers were dated to 1574 and it was similar to the Golden Hinde, the galleon Sir Francis Drake used to circumnavigate the globe in the 1570s. Eventually they named it the Gresham Ship after Sir Thomas Gresham, the legendary scholar and gunmaker who founded the Royal Exchange in 1571 - and whose initials were found on one of the ship's 7ft cast iron guns. Unlike the Mary Rose, which was much larger and heavier than average ships in the 1500s, Dr Milne said Gresham's ship was a typical example of London merchantmen of its day. They traded with France, Spain, North Africa and Constantinople, exploring the world in perilous conditions. Some 34 were commandeered to defeat the Spanish Armada in 1588. Dr Milne said the research had been excruciatingly slow. Caked in silt: The historians had a painstaking task to work out which artefacts on the ship were worth saving . Scientific: They used X-rays to discover the identity of each artefact under the sand - in this case a bottle . From the captain's table: The team found this ornate salt cellar concealed under centuries of sediment and silt . Relics: The researchers chipped away at each of the artefacts from the ship, which were covered in silt . 'A lot of the things we found, we didn't know what they were because they had come up covered in sand and gravel,' he said. 'We X-rayed them and painstakingly chipped away at the silt until we found what was underneath. There were boots, spoons and a salt cellar straight from the captain's table.' The team also found ingots of lead and tin and Kentish ragstone ballast in the cargo hold, along with a powder chamber for an iron gun. The ship's oak timbers have now taken their final journey from a Navy torpedo testing lake to the National Dive Centre in Stoney Cove, Leicestershire. Preserved by the water, they are now part of an 'underwater museum' which can be explored by the site's 30,000 trainee divers each year. The researchers hope to put the artefacts on display at Southend Museum in Essex from 2018.

"With some 130million books in existence, it's hard to fathom how the literary sphere's wealth of storylines could be boiled down into just six different categories. But a professor is now claiming that there are only half a dozen possible plots which any novel can follow. Matthew Jockers, from the University of Nebraska, has used a high-tech computer system to analyse more than 40,000 novels in a bid to find out the pattern behind storylines. Man in a hole: A professor has claimed that there are just six possible plots for novels - and that Moby Dick (left) and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (right) fall into the 'man in a hole' category . This graphic shows how the James Joyce novel follows a broad journey in which it starts on a positive note, plunges, and then re-emerges with positivity: a concept 46 per cent of novels follow, research shows . Instead of focusing on the narrative, the program, called Syuzhet, automatically studies the emotional journey on which novels take their readers. Mr Jockers found the emotional pattern used in novels can be broken down into just two categories, both of which are then divided into three sub-groups. He has labelled the two basic forms as 'man on a hill' - a mainly positive story in which there is a mid-way peak - and 'man in a hole', which tends to follow a character as they get into trouble and crawl back out again. According to Mr Jockers, 46 per cent of novels are made up of 'man in the hole'-style storylines, the most prominent of which is A Potrait of the Artist as a Young Man by James Joyce. Matthew Jockers analysed 40,000 novels through a computer system and found that novels follow these two broad emotional concepts - 'man in a hole' and 'man on a hill' Moby Dick by Herman Melville was also put into the same category, while the analysis shows Loves Music, Loves to Dance, by Mary Higgins Clarks, follows a similar format. Intensity by Dean Koontz and A Creed in Stone Creek, by Linda Lael Miller, were two examples of the 'man on a hill' format. The remaining four types  come from variations of those two broader categories, Mr Jockers claims. Mr Jockers said Intensity by Dean Koontz is one of the 'man on a hill' novels, as this graphic shows . A Creed in Stone Creek, by Linda Lael Miller, is another variant of the 'man on a hill' story . Mr Jockers decided to create the program after attending a lecture by Kurt Vonnegut, author of Slaughter-house Five. Mr Vonnegut said there was no reasons why the 'simple shape of stories' could not be fed into computers. It was Mr Vonnegut who initially coined the phrases 'man in a hole' and 'man on a hill'. Experts have long been trying to analyse how novels are formed. Meanwhile, Mr Jockers shows that Simple Genius by David Baldacci is a version of the 'man in a hole' story . In 2004, Christopher Booker published The Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories. He suggested there were seven types of tales: rags to riches; overcoming the monster; the quest; voyage and return; comedy; tragedy, and rebirth. In the 18th Century, Italian playwright Carlos Gozzi said there were 36 dramatic situations, which included the revolt; the enigma; madness; involuntary crimes of love; self sacrifice, and ambition.","Matthew Jockers used a high-tech computer system to carry out research .

The 27-year-old athlete, whose arms span 6ft 7in (201 cm)—disproportionate to his height of 6ft 4in inches (193 cm)— maintains that his performance is down to his highly calorific diet, which sees him feast on a staggering 12,000 calories every day.

"Manchester United's stars are being worked harder in training than ever before by new manager Louis van Gaal, club insiders have revealed. Such is Van Gaal's ferocious desire to fast track the players he inherited from David Moyes on to the levels he desires that Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie, Juan Mata and Co. are being driven relentlessly by the Dutch coach on a daily basis. Chief among Van Gaal's methods as he tries to bring about fundamental change at Old Trafford are incessant passing drills that see the United players put through endless repetitive routines aimed at honing and developing new instincts. Manchester United's players have been put through their paces daily since Louis van Gaal took over as boss . Louis van Gaal has placed extra importance on passing drillsas he stamps his authority on Manchester United . Louis van Gaal has stepped up the intensity of United's training to get stars such as Angel di Maria fitter . Van Gaal has spoken of how he wishes his players to think differently and react differently when they are in possession. By putting them through these endless drills, he hopes they will use the ball better and will eventually make better decisions without even seeming to think. The new United manager has also shown himself to be a lover of double training sessions. Van Gaal asked the United squad to train twice-a-day regularly on pre-season tour of America as he sought to change his players' thoughts and instincts quickly. That practise has continued to an extent, though, now that the Barclays Premier League season has started and it's not unusual for players to train late in the morning, rest in the sleep unit that was installed last year at Carrington and then train again in the afternoon. 'It can seem relentless but the players understand why Louis is doing it,' said a club source on Tuesday. Louis van Gaal was spotted leaving the Lowry Hotel in Manchester on Tuesday morning . Louis van Gaal seemed to be looking for the right space as he prepared to leave the Lowry hotel . Louis van Gaal was seen loading his gear into a car as he left the Lowry Hotel . Manchester United's players have also been playing full-paced 11v11 games in training prior to games . Robin van Persie (right, with Radamel Falcao) has praised the methods of Louis van Gaal . Manchester United's players have often been sleeping at Carrington between double training sessions . 'The passing drills are incredible. It's just 'pass, pass, pass' until the manager and his coaches think the players are beginning to do it almost naturally and instinctively.' Van Persie – who played under van Gaal for two years for the Dutch national team – said yesterday that some of the United manager's sessions are 'incredible', with players having to be focussed during 'every single minute'. It is also understood that another of Van Gaal's policies is to play full-sided 11 v 11 games for 45 minutes two days before a game. This game is required to be of the intensity of a Premier League game and is aimed at preparing the players mentally and physically for the competitive game that is due to follow 48 hours later. Wayne Rooney (left, with coach Marcel Bout) and his United team-mates are said to be pleased with training . Luke Shaw (left) and Radamel Falcao are two new signings adapting to Louis van Gaal's training methods . It is not unusual for managers to play full-sided games in training as it allows the weekend's anticipated first team the opportunity to get used to each other and grow familiarity. However, they are usually played at half or three-quarter pace and full-on contact is minimal as managers are generally paranoid about injuries. What has struck the United players about Van Gaal's 45 minute games, though, has been the intensity. To play these games at full pace is rare but Van Gaal insists on it so that his players are 'match ready' when the actual competitive fixture comes around two days later. During his time in England – and indeed during the World Cup – Van Gaal has shown himself to be surprisingly open about injuries and fitness issues. Most managers like to hide problems from the public so as to keep the opposition guessing and will sometimes exaggerate minor knocks to fool rivals in to thinking star players aren't available. Van Gaal doesn't do this but the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach is obsessively secretive about his team shapes and training drills to the extent that he will only allow players and staff absolutely vital to the session anywhere near the Carrington pitches when the first team are working. Paddy McNair made his debut for Manchester United against West Ham last Saturday . Paddy McNair (left) is one of several young players Louis van Gaal has promoted to United's first team . Other Carrington staff are asked to stay away so that Van Gaal can go about his business in private before players are handed individual dvds and dossiers of their training performances to watch later with United's performance staff and even at home in their spare time. Meanwhile, United fans can expect Van Gaal to introduce more young players in to the team. Sources have revealed that players like Paddy McNair – who made his debut at home to West Ham on Saturday – will continue to be blooded even when it's not 100 per cent necessary as Van Gaa is determined to find out which are good enough and which aren't as soon as possible. 'He's doing great,' added Van Persie this week. 'He's trying to get his philosophy in to a lot of new players. I'm convinced that we will do what he wants us to do and go where he wants us to go. It's very demanding but in a good way.' Like our Manchester United Facebook page.","New United boss has implemented a strict new training regime .

Skyler was born at 3:44pm at home into my loving and welcoming hands. 'Skyler is a very chill dude and super easy going. Looks a lot like his sister too. Thank you for all of the support and I look forward to sharing this chapter of my life with you!' Royal College of Midwives spokesman Janet Fyle said: 'She's quite far along in her pregnancy so there can't really be any problem with it, and if she's always done weightlifting I don't think it would suddenly bring on early labour. 'Obviously we aren't advising pregnant women to take up weightlifting if they've never done it before, but if she's used to the exercise it's OK. 'We always say if women were riding bikes or going to the gym before they were pregnant they can continue to do so, they just need to tell their instructor they are pregnant and then they can adjust the exercises. 'I understand why people might be concerned, but if the woman doesn't want to stop doing her exercise that's fine.' She added: 'Take that haters! Ha ha ha!' While some appeared to support her decision in September - including several people who claimed to be doctors - others were horrified. 'This is actually sickening,' wrote Amanda Cinq-Mars. 'I hope pregnant [women] around the world do not do this kind of cr**. 'I am a crossfit enthusiast but I DO NOT recommend this at all. Doctors always strongly suggest to not lift heavy because you can sever your placenta and cause major damage an early labour and miscarriage... Posting this picture goes people the wrong message that this is OKAY when it's not!' Another, Josh Giannapolous, wrote: 'Cross fit? This goes way beyond a way of life, and right into an obsession. 'She is very selfish for endangering a life for her own personal gains and achievements. This is not a proud picture to post. 'That amount of weight lifted above the head is extremely dangerous while pregnant. Cross fit is a hobby, not a necessity to life. It's becoming unconscious to the dangers of reality.' Users who sprang to her defence included Katy McNiff Nicholas, who wrote: 'You go girl! Looking great!!! Much better than a lot of obese pregnant ladies with high blood pressure and diabetes who get short of breath walking up a flight of steps.' Controversial: Lea-Ann Ellison provoked debate when she posted photos of herself lifting weights . Body-building: Ms Ellison was pictured lifting heavy kettlebells above her head just weeks before she was due . Ms Ellison is not the only workout-loving mother-to-be to make headlines after her pregnancy regime came to light. Four years ago Cambridgeshire fitness enthusiast Sarah-Jane Cousins hit the front pages after being pictured lifting 15kg dumbbells with just 11 days to go before her due date. The Los Angeles bodybuilder is a devotee of the CrossFit training regime . Another mother criticised for continuing a tough fitness regime throughout her pregnancy was model Nell McAndrew, who was stunned at the backlash she received after competing in a gruelling marathon while 20 weeks pregnant. Speaking to MailOnline after the marathon in November last year, McAndrew said: 'When I tell people I'm still exercising, they react as if I've told them I've been smoking or drinking alcohol while pregnant. 'But what I'm doing is actually good for me and my baby.' Nell's belief that fitness aids labour is backed up by studies that have found that babies of women who exercise are better off when it comes to their birth because 'foetuses of exercising women may tolerate labour better than those of non-exercisers,' according to The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG). Along with official NHS guidelines that recommend 30 minutes of moderate exercise a day for expectant mothers, the RCOG also advocates exercise where there are no complications in the pregnancy. Precautions like not exercising at a high intensity or running when it is too hot should also be taken. The Royal College guidelines said: 'In most cases, exercise is safe for both mother and fetus during pregnancy and women should therefore be encouraged to initiate or continue exercise to derive the health benefits associated with such activities.' They add that it is untrue that exercise increases the risk of miscarriage or damage to an unborn baby. The guidelines add: 'Additionally, active women experience less insomnia, stress, anxiety and depression.'

"Increased risk: Pregnant women who suffer severe morning such as the Duchess of Cambridge, pictured leaving hospital in December, are more at risk of pre-eclampsia, a study has found . Severe morning sickness that blighted the early weeks of the Duchess of Cambridge’s pregnancy could cause complications for mother and baby, doctors said yesterday. Those who, like Kate, need hospital treatment for the sickness before 12 weeks of pregnancy are around 20 per cent more likely to be at risk of pre-eclampsia, a study has found. But experts said they hoped the timing of Kate’s sickness, which came early in her pregnancy, meant she would escape the most worrying consequences because the condition is most hazardous when it occurs during the middle three months. In early December, the Duchess was admitted to King Edward VII Hospital suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, a rare disorder that triggers severe vomiting during pregnancy. Kate, whose baby is due in July, was forced to cancel engagements following repeated bouts of sickness and dehydration. But Palace officials say she is now making a steady recovery and she has been seen out and about in public looking much better. Her condition is most common in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, after which the symptoms ease in most sufferers. But the new research suggests that when the condition occurs during the second trimester, it can lead to serious complications in later pregnancy that need close monitoring. The complications include pre-eclampsia, which raises the woman’s blood pressure leading to strokes and even death, premature separation of the placenta from the womb lining before birth, and having a small baby. The study, published in BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, examined data from the Swedish medical birth register between 1997 and 2009. Data from 1,155,033 women showed that . 1.1 per cent of them suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum before they . were 22 weeks pregnant. The condition is caused by high levels of the . pregnancy hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin, and a woman’s . sensitivity to it. Researchers . compared data from women having normal pregnancies to those who needed . admission to hospital for treatment in the first or second trimester of . pregnancy. Danger: Pre-eclampsia is more common in first-time pregnancies and can lead to premature birth, still birth and babies being born smaller than average . They found a slightly increased risk of almost 20 per cent in the rate of pre-eclampsia in women who were hospitalised with sickness before 12 weeks of pregnancy. Pre-eclampsia is more common in first-time pregnancies and can lead to premature birth, stillbirth and babies being smaller than average. As many as one in 20 first-time mothers develop pre-eclampsia, while around 20 women die each year from conditions linked to high blood pressure. It is thought to claim the lives of 600 babies a year in the UK.","Pregnant women who need hospital treatment before 12 weeks are 20 per cent more likely to suffer pre-eclampsia, study finds .

"Kansas City Chiefs safety Husain Abdullah should not have been penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct when he dropped to his knees in prayer after an interception, the NFL said on Tuesday. The league's rule book prohibits players from celebrating while on the ground, but spokesman Michael Signora wrote in an email on Tuesday that 'the officiating mechanic in this situation is not to flag a player who goes to the ground as part of religious expression, and as a result, there should have been no penalty on the play.' The flag thrown in the fourth quarter of Kansas City's 41-14 victory over the New England Patriots on Monday led to criticism on social media, with many wondering how it was different from players such as former NFL quarterback Tim Tebow dropping to one knee in Christian prayer. Penalty: Kansas City Chiefs safety Husain Abdullah received a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty after he dropped to the ground and performed the Sajdah (above) during Monday's game against the Patriots . Big play: Abdullah had just intercepted a pass from  Tom Brady (above) and ran it back into the end zone . Further punishment: The NFL may also fine Abdullah (above) as well . Abdullah is a devout Muslim who took a year off from American football to make a pilgrimage to Mecca. He said after Monday's game that he knew before he even reached the end zone he would drop to his knees in thankful prayer after intercepting Tom Brady. After he slid to the grass in Arrowhead Stadium, yellow flags came flying from the officials. 'I don't think it was because of the actual prostration that I got the penalty,' Abdullah told The Associated Press afterward. 'It was because of the slide.' And that's precisely the explanation that Chiefs coach Andy Reid said he received from the game officials. They had no issue with the prayer, Reid said, only the celebratory slide. 'I'm pretty sure he (Reid) understands who I am, what my faith is,' Abdullah said. 'And again, the prostration is all right. It's the slide. Come to a full stop, get down, make the prostration, get up and get out.' Faith: Abdullah (above, with his son Jalaal) is a devout Muslim who fasts during Ramadan . Pilgrimage: Abdullah (above, with his son Jalaal) also sat out the 2012 season so he could visit Mecca during the Hajj in October . No response: Abdullah (above) has yet to comment on the call . The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a civil liberties and advocacy organization, issued a statement early Tuesday asking that the NFL take steps in response to the penalty. 'To prevent the appearance of a double standard, we urge league officials to clarify the policy on prayer and recognize that the official made a mistake in this case,' CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper said. Reid didn't agree with the penalty, but he also didn't make much of it. 'When you go to Mecca,' he said, referring to the end zone, 'you should have the privilege to slide anywhere you want to slide. We have two priests in here. They will vouch for me.' Indeed, there were two pastors sitting in Reid's postgame news conference. Tebowing: Giving praise following touchdowns and major plays is common among many players in the NFL, most notably Tim Tebow (above) Abdullah is in his second year with the Chiefs after spending an entire season away from the game. He decided that, in the prime of his career, he would join his brother Hamza - who also was playing in the NFL at the time - to make a pilgrimage to Mecca. The Fifth Pillar of Islam is The Hajj, the pilgrimage that all Muslims are supposed to make once in their lifetime. Abdullah, who also fasts during Ramadan, told the AP in an interview last year the brothers wanted to make sure they did the pilgrimage while they still had the health and means to go. In the case of Hamza, it proved costly. He never got a shot to return to the NFL.","Husain Abdullah received a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty after he performed the Sajdah on Monday night .

"Britain's children are ballooning in size and perhaps no one is more aware of this than Paul Wibberley, a school uniform specialist based in Merseyside. He is now selling size 26 school skirts to children as young as 11 and blazers with a 56 inch chest. ‘Nearly all of my suppliers are offering increased sizes and they’re providing larger and larger sizes with every season,’ he said. His shop is featured in the latest episode of the Big Body Squad, Channel 5’s series about how Britain’s bulging waistline is spawning a whole new industry of services for those who are so large they need specialist help. Paul Wibberley runs a successful school uniform business in Merseyside but he has noticed a worrying trend in sales of plus-sized clothing . Mr Wibberley shows the camera quite how large the waist of a pair of 'sturdy fit' trousers can be . For the first time in history, obesity is killing more people than malnutrition. Around 15 million Britons are obese and it is estimated that this will cost the UK a staggering £27 billion by 2016. Services touched on in the series include specialist shoe-makers who are catering to the those with fat ankles and feet as well as companies who are using military science to develop extra strong harnesses and hoists to mobilise those who cannot move themselves. And in the latest episode, the issue of school children as young as five being offered plus-sized clothes is explored. With one in three children  now classed as obese and 140,000 so large that they reach the adults recommendations for adult weight loss surgery, larger fitting garments are big business. In 2001, Mr Wibberley’s shop only supplied two sizes of uniform - ‘slim fit’ and ‘regular fit’ - but now ‘slim fit’ no longer exists and has been replaced by ‘sturdy fit’. Sturdy fit trousers are elasticated and their leg length and waist are in different proportions to normal trousers. Their . waist size is for children two years older than the leg length, meaning . that trousers designed for a ten-year-old  will have a waist for that . of a 12 year-old. This style goes up to a staggering 50 inch waist. A recent study has shown the extent of children's growth over the past 35 years. The data will be used to create a new generation of clothing to fit the nation's taller and wider youth . The best-selling skirt on offer at the shop starts at a ladies size 10 and goes up to 26. Mr Wibberley says he has sold the biggest sized skirt to girls as young as 11. And on the day of filming, the shop assistant sells a blazer with a 40 inch chest to an 11-year-old girl. Now, 40 per cent of customers at the uniform shop opt for sturdy fit. Five years ago Mr Wibberley also brought in real adult clothes for children as young as 11. This means he is now able to provide blazers for men with a 42 inch going up to a 56 inch chest. Uniforms as large as 3XL are already  an established part of sizing in the shop but Mr Wibberley believes  that to keep up with the growing demand for larger uniforms, companies will soon be offering 4XL. Ironic: Uniformed sportswear is now catering to supersize teens who need clothes for PE lessons. Currently the largest size is XXXL, but Mr Wibberley believes it will go up to XXXXL next year. Kerry Taverner, an NHS weight management advisor in the area, is concerned about  the rapidly rising number of overweight customers frequenting Mr Wibberley’s  shop: ‘Around 70 per cent of parents are unaware  their children are overweight. ‘When I see sizes like [the ones in this shop] I find it worrying and definitely, something needs to be done. ‘Culturally, when we see someone who is overweight, they fit in much more now than a few years back.’ But Mr Wibberley isn’t the only person offering children larger fitting clothes. Clothing chains have been forced to rip up their sizing system for children to reflect the fact youngsters are now taller, wider and heavier than ever. A new template for those aged four to 16 has been devised for retailers to reflect the major changes to body shapes over the last few decades. Six of the country’s biggest children’s fashion chains – Marks & Spencer, Next, George at Asda, Tesco, Monsoon and the Shop Direct group – are now using the guidleines. Full body 3D scans were carried out on 2,885 youngsters across the country to produce the updated size regime. The last time a comprehensive survey of children’s shapes was carried out was by the British Standards Institution in 1978. The figures were compiled by Shape GB, a collaboration between retailers, several academic bodies, clothing size experts Alvanon and scanner experts. Girls of 11 were found to be on average  four inches wider around the waist, while boys are generally bigger through the waist and chest. Research has shown that over 80 per cent of obese children today will go on to be obese adults. Childhood obesity costs the capital alone £7 million a year and if these children do not lose weight it is estimated they will costs the taxpayer £110 million in adulthood.","School uniform specialist Paul Wibberley has seen kids' waists balloon .

"David Moyes insists that no-one is good enough to displace Wayne Rooney up front for both Manchester United and England. Moyes, who put Rooney at the heart of his Manchester United side before being sacked in April after less than a year in charge, reckons that the best could be yet to come from the forward - so long as he concentrates on scoring goals rather than all-action forays across the pitch. The Scot did, however, urge Rooney's team-mates to help ease the pressure on their captain by creating more chances for him. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rooney: Good performance four years ago counts for nothing . Plenty to say: Wayne Rooney in training with England at St-Jokob Park in Basle on Sunday . Centre of attention: Rooney will lead England against Switzerland in their first Euro 2016 qualifier on Monday . Rooney has taken over the armband for both club and country this season but both teams have been lacklustre and the 28-year-old is showing far from his best form, despite scoring the winning goal in last week's friendly win over Norway. Radamel Falcao's blockbuster loan signing at United has raised questions over Rooney's role in his club team, while Raheem Sterling's emergence has led to calls for the Liverpool starlet to fill the No 10 role in Roy Hodgson's side currently occupied by Rooney. 'Some people might wonder if we have seen the best of him. I don't,' Moyes told The Sun. 'I still believe he is one of the best in the Premier League. Bright future: Raheem Sterling (second left) is viewed by many as England's No 10 in waiting . Pressure: Colombia striker Radamel Falcao could be competing for a place with Rooney at Old Trafford . 'What he needs to make sure is that he's not trying to do everyone else's job too. Sometimes he feels like he has to do everything. 'Other players have to help Wayne, find him in the right positions, supply him so he can score goals.' Rooney will lead England against Switzerland in Basle on Monday night in the Three Lions' first Euro 2016 qualifier. Despite 19-year-old Sterling's brilliant displays for both Liverpool and England, Moyes made it clear that he thought Rooney remained a better player than anyone younger than him and deserved his lead role in Roy Hodgson's side. Moyes also added that in future he could see Rooney dropping deeper into a midfield role but not while he still had plenty to offer as a striker.","Wayne Rooney needs Manchester United and England team-mates to create more chances for him, according to David Moyes .

"We all know people who aren’t happy unless they have a better house, car or job than the neighbours. Now it seems there’s another way to keep up with the Joneses – in the bedroom. Believing that they are having more sex than their neighbours is a crucial happiness factor for couples, says Tim Wadsworth, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Colorado Boulder . Professor Tim Wadsworth, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Colorado Boulder, analysed data collected . between 1993 and 2006 from the General Social Survey, an opinion poll . which has monitored the psyche of American society since 1972. Satisfied: Couples who know they are having more sex than their friends are happier . In total, . he studied data collected from 15,386 people. Since the beginning of the survey, all . respondents have been asked whether they are ‘very happy’, . ‘pretty happy’ or ‘not too happy’. After taking factors including income, marital status, health and age into account, . respondents who had sex at least two to three times a month were 33 per . cent more likely to report a higher level of happiness than those who . had no sex during the previous 12 months. Prof Wadsworth found that people . reported steadily higher levels of happiness as they reported steadily more regular sex . Those who had sex once a week were 44 . per cent happier than those had not had sex for a year, whilst those who . had sex two to three times a week were 55 per cent more likely to . report a higher level of happiness. But his study, entitled ‘Sex and the Pursuit of Happiness: How Other People’s Sex Lives are Related to Our Sense of Well-Being’, also found that those who were having sex but believed they were having less sex than their peers were unhappier than those who believed they were having as much or more than their peers. He found that if members of a peer . group . were having sex two to three times a month but believed their peers were . on a once-weekly schedule, their probability of reporting a higher . level . of happiness fell by about 14 per cent. He . said: ‘There's an overall increase in the sense of wellbeing that comes . with having sex more frequently, but there's also this relative aspect . to it. Chatting about your sex life can be a source of anxiety according to new research . ‘Having more sex makes us happy, but thinking that we are having more sex than other people makes us even happier.’ But while income can be guessed from a neighbour's new car, sex is a more clandestine activity. So how do men and women know how frequently their peers are  have sex? Prof Wadsworth says that the mass media provides people with clues. Wadsworth noted that magazines such as Cosmopolitan and Men's Health, frequently reported the results of their own or others' sex surveys. Conversations within friendship groups also suggest how much peers are getting intimate. ‘There is plenty of evidence that information concerning sexual behaviour is learned through discussions within peer groups and friendship networks,’ added Prof Wadsworth. ‘I can't think of a better explanation for why how much sex other people are having would influence a person's happiness.' He added that, as a species, we tend to worry that we are not measuring up to an ideal. ‘We're usually not looking down [on people] and thinking of ourselves as better off. We're usually looking up and feeling insufficient and inadequate.","Major study finds that keeping up with the Joneses in the bedroom is an important source of satisfaction .

"England's greatest goalscorer Sir Bobby Charlton has backed Wayne Rooney to break his long-standing record. New England captain Rooney is closing in on Charlton's international tally of 49 having scored for England for the 41st time against Norway last week.

Charlton, 76, could also see his record Manchester United mark of 249 beaten by the club's current skipper Rooney, who has netted 217 times for the Old Trafford club. Charlton, who retired from international duty after the 1970 World Cup, said: 'He is really keen to break my record, which seems to have stood for a long time. 'I've told him not to worry too much. He has my backing. I'll be quite happy when it comes. 'I told him, ""Think hard about it and maybe you'll have some good news"". 'I've had good news from it all my life. I don't mind him taking it. 'It would a great achievement - and it would be a change for me. That's good. He's a good lad and I don't mind it at all.' As well as his records, Charlton is also revered as one of England's 1966 World Cup winners and he hopes Rooney will one day be able to add team success to his international achievements. Goal machine: Rooney could also break Charlton's Manchester United goalscoring record . Record holder: Charlton scored 249 times for Manchester United during his time at the club . Rooney has been criticised in the past for a failure to shine at major tournaments and he has taken over the national captaincy at a tough time after a poor World Cup campaign. Charlton said: 'What we have to do now is make sure that he wins. We need to start winning. It is all very well having these accolades that people push to you, but you have to make sure you get something out of it.' Charlton was representing his charity 'Find A Better Way' which aims to rid the world of effects of landmines by harnessing cutting-edge technology. Traditional methods of finding landmines in former war zones using crude metal detectors are slow and dangerous. Knowledge: Charlton was speaking at day one of the Soccerex Convention in Manchester . Charlton has brought people from different fields together and found funding from many sources to find better ways of detection. He said: 'There are lots of places I have been to and we have to make sure it is safe. 'There are places where if it is raining people go under the trees, but there are other people that will lay a bomb there simply because people will go under the trees. That can't be right. 'Now we have improved things and got into the minds of many people who are very interested in helping. We have universities who are helping. 'It's been fantastic.

"Men could soon be able to buy an anti-impotence drug over the counter. Pharmaceutical companies Sanofi and Eli Lilly and Co say they plan to ask health regulators for permission to sell Cialis, the world's top-selling anti-impotence drug, without a prescription. The drug, which is also used to treat enlarged prostate glands, is currently only available by prescription. The anti-impotence drug Cialis could become available over the counter in the U.S. and Europe . Under the terms of the agreement, Sanofi is buying the exclusive rights to apply for approval of Cialis tablets over the counter in the U.S., Europe, Canada and Australia. It is not yet clear whether this could include the UK and when the drug could become available if approved. It also remains to be seen whether regulators will allow Cialis to be sold without a prescription, in view of possible side effects. Like rival anti-impotence drugs, such as Pfizer Inc's Viagra, Cialis can cause a dangerous fall in blood pressure if taken with nitrates, a class of heart drugs that include nitroglycerin. It is also inappropriate for use by people with severe heart disease. Viagra is not currently available over the counter but can be bought from some specialist pharmacies without a prescription. It's not clear when the drug could become available and if health regulators will allow it to be sold without a prescription as it is dangerous for people with heart disease and those on some medications (file picture) However, before it can be purchased, patients have to be asked a series of health questions by the pharmacist to ensure it is appropriate for them to take. Professor Raj Pesad, a urologist in Bristol, told MailOnline: 'If it happens, there needs to be a measure of safety but I think is entirely feasible for pharmacists to advise because Cialsis is a very safe drug. ‘It's the sort of thing that doesn't necessarily need to be restricted to doctors’ prescribing - but it needs to be given with care to people with heart disease or those taking some heart drugs. ‘The local pharmacist will know what medications people are on from their local GPs so it is a safe system. ‘However, it can have side effects and could make things like heartburn and acid reflux worse.’","Drugs companies will ask for permission to sell Cialis without a prescription .

Six wins out of six, joint top of the table, and Ashley Cole’s first return to England as a tasty side dish. Not enough for the home supporters, apparently. Manchester City failed to sell out their crucial Champions League game against Roma on Tuesday night . By contrast Roma were handed a huge lift by their packed away end rammed with passionate supporters . A half-empty Etihad Stadium certainly did not impress Paul Scholes, United legend turned TV pundit. ‘They've got the team, they've definitely got the players, the quality is definitely there, but do the crowd realise how lucky they are to be in this competition? I don't think they do,’ was the damning verdict from Scholes. Busy tweeter Rio Ferdinand posed the question: ‘Would fans rather watch Ramsay’s Kitchen?’ Ouch. Double ouch given the United leanings. Not even the Manchester return of Ashley Cole could rouse the fans to turn up in their droves . Misfiring strikers . Four goals in the two games leading up to this one meant that expectations were high for Edin Dzeko but he found the Roma defence a step up from Hull and, er, Sheffield Wednesday. Strange, that. The Bosnian can be infuriatingly inconsistent, which is why his City career includes so many substitute appearances. He was clearly disappointed when he was taken off for James Milner but with Stevan Jovetic coming back from injury, this was Dzeko’s chance to show why he should be first choice when all the forwards are up and running. Credit should go to Roma’s defenders, too. They have only conceded three goals all season and Tuesday night’s was from the penalty spot. Sergio Aguero was the scorer but that was the high point. The Argentine has five goals in eight games this season but did not look anything like the deadly menace he was for most of the last campaign until his thigh and hamstring problems started. He is a player of sublime quality but needed to show it against Roma. Edin Dzeko is sometimes infuriating to watch when he leads the line for Manuel Pellegrini's side . No-no for Yaya . Last season’s player of the year is another who appears to have taken several steps backwards since the summer. Rather like Steven Gerrard at Liverpool, Toure is the go-to player when things are going wrong on the pitch. He can break up play, he can pick a forward pass and he can gallop forwards and score blinders. But that’s when he is on form. Whether it is the speculation of his departure after the ‘birthday cake affair’, or whether it is an emotional hangover from the death of his brother – which would be quite understandable – Toure is not making his usual impact. Roma were ripped apart by injuries on Tuesday night so it could have been Toure’s stage. He did not take the opportunity. Yaya Toure has struggled with his performances since a summer of discontent at the Etihad Stadium . Vincent Kompany stares at the floor after Francesco Totti equalised for the Italian visitors . It was a mistake by Kompany to allow Totti through on goal before he sublimely finished beyond Joe Hart . Spanish sighs . Boss Pellegrini had this game down as a must-win, which meant he had to look for creators who could unpick the Italian lock. Full backs Maicon – a flop at the Etihad and made to look a dummy by Gareth Bale four years ago – and veteran Ashley Cole would have been targeted, pre-match as possible weak links. Oh dear. Yes Maicon conceded the penalty, for which he was booked, but that apart the Brazilian looked a player transformed from his City experience. Equally Cole was comfortable in his role. Jesus Navas was so bad that he only lasted 45 minutes while fellow Spaniard David Silva gave his all but could not find the creative spark which was required. Jesus Navas was hooked at half-time after struggling to exert himself on the game from the start . Maicon was seen as a weak link before the fixture but had a superb game rampaging forward from the back . Leaving Les Rosbifs on the bench . A galaxy of talented foreigners on the pitch, two dyed-in-the-wool, no-nonsense English players sitting on the bench. Yet when James Milner and Frank Lampard were finally let loose, City started to re-discover their drive. Milner is one of those players who gets an unfair press – just look at the managers who have selected him for club and country. In ice-cream terms, he is vanilla. No frills, no chocolate topping, but utterly reliable as he showed that again on Tuesday night. As for Lampard, Frankie boy is enjoying his own Indian summer since his departure from Chelsea and was the manager’s pick to replace Dzeko. Had those two been on from the start, dictating the tempo and added some English grit, who knows what might have happened against a Roma side who had key players out, including Kevin Strootman. And before anyone brings up thirty-something Lampard’s age, think Francesco Totti, 38. Like MailOnline Sport's Facebook page.

"Former Argentina striker Mario Kempes underwent heart surgery in the United States on Tuesday. The 60-year-old had six bypasses during the operation in Connecticut and was in intensive care following the procedure, according to ESPN. Kempes is most famous for being top scorer with six goals as Argentina won the 1978 World Cup. Mario Kempes, 1978 World Cup and Golden Boot winner with Argentina, underwent heart surgery on Tuesday . Kempes scored twice in a 3-1 win over Holland in the 1978 World Cup final in Argentina . This included two in the final against Holland, which his country won 3-1. He scored 20 goals in 43 matches for Argentina and also played for Spanish side Valencia, where he was the league's top scorer for two seasons.

"Donald Sterling has been rejected by eight different law firms as he tries to file a lawsuit against the NBA. The disgraced LA Clippers owner has been banned from the NBA and is reportedly hoping to prevent a forced sale of the team following the racist recordings of him speaking to his alleged mistress. TMZ reports that the 81-year-old billionaire has approached eight major law firms asking them to represent him but he has been rejected by them all. Turned down: Donald Sterling has reportedly approached eight different large law firms to help him sue the NBA over his lifetime ban but all of them are believed to have turned him down . The names of the specific Los Angeles and San Francisco-based firms have not been released but they were described as being extremely large and prestigious. Legal sources told the site that the firms are worried that it would lead to bad publicity if they accepted him as a client. They reportedly fear that not only would any of their African American clients get upset, but also with their scandal-averse corporate clients. The rejections have reportedly come as personal insults to Sterling because he has doled out favors- and Clippers tickets- to partners at the respective law firms in the past. These reports come hours before a taped interview with the embattled owner is set to air. Apologizing: Sterling taped an interview with Anderson Cooper on Sunday and it is set to air Monday night . Sterling sat down with CNN's Anderson Cooper and apologized, the full tape of which will be shown later tonight. 'I'm not a racist,' he said in the . 'I made a terrible mistake. I'm here to apologize.' In his first public comments since being banned for life from the NBA, Sterling said years of good behavior as an owner should count toward his future. 'I'm a good member who made a mistake,' Sterling said. 'Am I entitled to one mistake, am I after 35 years? I mean, I love my league, I love my partners. Am I entitled to one mistake? It's a terrible mistake, and I'll never do it again.' Sit down: Shelly Sterling (left) revealed that she plans to formally divorce her husband of more than 60 years . The interview came nearly two weeks after NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling, fined him $2.5 million and urged the other league owners to force him to sell the team. Sterling said he waited to make a public apology because he was 'emotionally distraught.' 'The reason it's hard for me, very hard for me, is that I'm wrong,' Sterling said. 'I caused the problem. I don't know how to correct it.' He later added, 'If the owners feel I have another chance, then they'll give it to me.' Sterling's comments came on the same day ABC News posted excerpts of an interview his estranged wife gave to Barbara Walters.","The embattled NBA owner is reportedly trying to sue the league .

"Alan Pardew has admitted he is lucky not to have been sacked by Newcastle owner Mike Ashley – but will continue to fight for his future by axing senior players at Swansea. The under-fire boss has conceded that he is fortunate to still be in charge of the Magpies, who are joint bottom of the Premier League after six games. And Sportsmail understands Pardew will gamble on his position by making changes for Saturday’s trip to the Liberty Stadium – including dropping Yoan Gouffran and handing forgotten man Gabriel Obertan his first Premier League start in 18 months. Newcastle boss Alan Pardew will take some gambles with his team for their trip to Swansea next up in a bid to improve their fortunes . Magpies owner Mike Ashley reportedly told a journalist Pardew would be sacked if Newcastle lost at Stoke . United spent £30million on their first-team squad during the summer but Pardew is prepared to rip up the tactics employed during the early part of the season in a bid to bring about an improvement. Emmanuel Riviere – the £6m striker who was hooked at half-time during Monday’s 1-0 defeat at Stoke – is set to be replaced by Papiss Cisse, while £12m Remy Cabella is running out of chances to return on his sizeable investment. But it is the recall for Obertan – who featured just three times in the league last season – which demonstrates how frustrated Pardew has become with some players. The 25-year-old was signed on Pardew’s recommendation in 2011 but has struggled for form and fitness and has made just 22 top-flight starts in three years. Pardew, meanwhile, will talk with Ashley this week, although his employment remains safe in the short term. Sources close to the billionaire insist that even defeat at Swansea would not trigger a change of manager, with Pardew set for a £5m payout should he be sacked. Pardew was met with a barrage of criticism after Newcastle's defeat to Stoke on Monday night . Newcastle supporters held numerous banners calling for Pardew to be sacked during the 1-0 defeat at Stoke . Ashley does not want to go through the financial trauma of changing bosses and remains in support of the 53-year-old, despite unrest among supporters who fear a repeat of the 2009 relegation. Skipper Fabricio Coloccini, however, insists there is a better mood around the camp compared to five years ago, when United went down after a season in which Kevin Keegan, Chris Hughton, Joe Kinnear and Alan Shearer all took charge of first-team affairs. ‘It feels very different,’ said the Argentine defender. ‘We have controlled games. Last time we went down we could not control games. Now we do. Despite a poor start to the season Newcastle skipper Fabricio Coloccini is confident they can turn it around . ‘We have a tight group all working for each other. We are staying positive as well. We just need three points to take the pressure off. ‘I have extra responsibility because I am captain and I take that.’ And Coloccini has called on fans to get behind the team this weekend. ‘The fans have been fantastic,’ he said. ‘We just have to keep going. 'We are training hard and giving everything. You can see on the pitch we want to win the games. The other teams have maybe two chances against us, and they score. That happens when you are having a bad time.’","Alan Pardew says he is lucky to still be in a job after Newcastle remain rock bottom of the Premier League after a 1-0 defeat to Stoke on Monday night .

"Atletico Madrid will have Diego Simeone back on the touchline as they attempt to put their Champions League campaign back on course. If his return to the dug-out has the same effect it had on Saturday in the league then Juventus have a long night ahead. The communion between the Calderon and the man they call El Cholo is, at present, greater than the bond between any manager and his home fans, and his return from a six-match suspension at the weekend helped inspire a 4-0 win over Sevilla. Diego Simeone has served his European touchline ban and will return for the clash against Juventus . Simeone's name was sung before the start of Saturday's game, hundreds of photographers surrounded him as he took his place on the bench, and when the show began the Argentine coach put in his usual shift, constantly on his feet pointing, correcting and encouraging with that contagious energy that inspires his team but has also seen him fall foul of the game's governing bodies in recent matches. His Liga ban was for tapping the fourth official on the back of the head in the Spanish Super Cup second leg. His ban in Europe came from going on to the pitch in the European Cup final seeking out Real Madrid's Rafael Varane. In his absence Atletico had dropped two important home points in the league against Celta Vigo and lost to Olympiacos in their first group match in the Champions League. During his absence, Atletico Madrid drew with Celta Vigo in the league and lost to Olympiacos in Europe . Tonight they will be at full strength on and off the pitch as Juventus come to town. The Italians beat Atlanta 3-0 at the weekend to maintain their 100 percent record. Carlos Tevez will lead the line for them tonight and former Atletico youth-teamer and Real Madrid player Alvaro Morata should also feature. Of Tevez, Simeone said: 'He is an extraordinary player. The closer he is to goal the more he comes alive. We have to make sure that he has no time to think and that he can never comfortably receive the ball in time and space.' The Argentine manager's return to domestic competition coincided with a 4-0 rout of Sevilla . Atletico Madrid will not name their playing squad until just hours before the game but Simeone did confirm that Miguel Moya will start in goal ahead of Jan Oblak who let in three against Olympiacos in the first group game. Captain Gabi is almost definitely out with Koke like to move back to holding midfield alongside Tiago behind a Raul Garcia, Arda Turan and Antoine Greizmann. Simeone has vowed to try to keep his temper under control on the touchline to avoid another ban. 'You feel helpless up in the stands' he said after a frustrating night in the Georgios Karaiskakis Stadium against the Greek Champions two weeks ago. That defeat has heaped the pressure on last year's finalists. 'This is a final' said Simeone ahead of what should be another raucous night in Madrid against currently the best side in Italy.

'She was quickly followed by thousands of stingers who completely engulfed it.' Staying well clear: People keep a safe distance from the post box which had been taken over as a temporary nest by a swarm of wasps . The wasps buzzed around the box for around five minutes before returning to their nest on the side of a nearby house. Passerby Peter Lloyd said: 'I was too scared of getting stung to send my letters.

"A Tory MP has questioned how Benefits Street 'star' White Dee can make repeated live television appearances while she is unable to work because she is depressed. The unemployed single mother-of-two was accused of being 'bone idle' today after she was interviewed by Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford on ITV's This Morning. The 42-year-old appeared to have had her hair coloured and put make-up on before appearing on the show. White Dee - whose real name is Deirdre Kelly - went on the show just two days after she appeared on Channel 4's Benefits Britain: The Live Debate. Scroll down for video . Television appearance: White Dee has made TV appearances but says she was not paid . Questions: Following the appearance Dee was accused of being 'bone idle' by a Conservative MP . There have also been rumours that she is being lined up to appear on Celebrity Big Brother which will net her a minimum fee of £60,000. The 42-year-old insists that she has been unable to work since her mother died because she has been suffering from depression. She said in a recent interview on Channel 5: 'I haven't been on benefits my whole life. At the moment I am not in a place where (I can work). I suffer with depression and I am being assessed for bipolar disorder. Footage courtsey of ITV This Morning . TV appearances: White Dee has been tipped to appear on Celebrity Big Brother after 'starring' on Channel 4's Benefits Street . Controversy: Critics have questioned whether White Dee is really unable to work. However, mental health charities have said that depression is not always obvious . Benefits row: Tory MP Philip Davies today accused White Dee of being 'bone idle' 'I have a good day, I have three bad days . and then I have two good days. What sort of employer would I ring up . and say ""sorry I can't come in for three days - I'm low"".' Conservative MP Philip Davies accused White Dee of not being interested in finding a job. ‘If the people from Benefits Street are going to make these public appearances hopefully they are going to be paid for it so the taxpayer can get some of their money back,' he said. ‘I think every time people look at White Dee make an appearance hopefully it will serve as a reminder to people of the mess the benefits system is in and how badly Iain Duncan Smith’s reforms are needed. ‘White Dee is bone idle and doesn’t want to work another day in her life and has no intention of finding a job. She expects the taxpayer to fund her life on benefits. ‘The only person who should be depressed is the taxpayer who has to pick up the bill.’ Mr Davies spoke out today as separate figures revealed 800,000 people on Jobseeker's Allowance have had their benefits suspended because they had not done enough to find work. Anger: White Dee, from Channel 4's Benefits Street, appears on a live debate on Monday evening . Show stars: White Dee puts her arm  round fellow James Turner Street resident Tich during a benefits debate on Channel 4 . White Dee admitted that she receives 'about £200 per week' in state handouts to live off. The money she receives consists of child tax credits, child benefit and Employment Support Allowance (ESA). As a mother-of-two, she receives £20.30 per week for her first child 16-year-old Caitlin plus £13.40 for her second child Gerrard, aged seven. Claim form: White Dee will have to have filled out an 56-page form like this before she can claim benefits for depression . She is also eligible to receive £5,995 per year in child tax credits - which works out as £115 per week. Finally she receives ESA, which is paid to people who are sick. White Dee could receive up to £100.15 per week. However, this can be reduced if the individual does not attend support group sessions. In order to qualify for the ESA, she would have had to fill out A 56-page form giving full details of her medical condition. One of the questions on the form asks: 'Do you know when you will be well enough to work again? Yes or No'. Questions: One of the questions on the 56-page form is 'do you know when you will be well enough to work again?' Claimants are required to give brief details of their illness plus provide contact details for the doctor who signs off their medical statements. Once the form is submitted, White Dee will have been assessed by workers from Atos who would have ruled that she is unfit to work because of her depression. White Dee has insisted that depression means she cannot work - because she would be forced to take regular days off sick. During a recent television interview on Channel 5, she said: 'I haven't been on benefits my whole life. At the moment I am not in a place where (I can work). I suffer with depression and I am being assessed for bipolar disorder. 'I have a good day, I have three bad days and then I have two good days. What sort of employer would I ring up and say ""sorry I can't come in for three days - I'm low"". I would prefer to be working.' More than 800,000 people have had their Jobseeker's Allowance payments suspended by the government because they are not doing enough to look for work, new figures revealed today. Tough new rules were introduced in October 2012 as ministers made it clear what claimants had to do in return for their benefits. Payments have been suspended a total of 818,000 times since then if claimants failed to attend an appointment, rejected a job offer or were not doing enough to find work. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: 'This Government has always been clear that in return for claiming unemployment benefits jobseekers have a responsibility to do everything they can to get back into work. 'As part of the Government’s long-term economic plan, we are ending the something for nothing culture and supporting those who want to work hard and play by the rules.' 'People who are in a job know that if they don’t play by the rules or fail to turn up in the morning, there might be consequences, so it’s only right that people on benefits should have similar responsibilities. 'Sanctions are used as a last resort, but it’s only right that there is a penalty if people fail to play by them.' White Dee has revealed she receives around £200 a week in handouts which consist of Employment Support Allowance (ESA) because of her condition, child benefit and child tax credits. In order to get her ESA benefits for . depression, White Dee will have been assessed by Atos workers who would . have signed her off as unfit to work. During the process, she may have . provided a GP's note confirming that she is sick. As a mother-of two she is entitled to £33.70 child benefit per week, a maximum of £100.15 ESA payments because she is 'depressed', plus £115 per week child tax credits. The Benefits Street matriarch has been living off handouts after being sacked from her job as a council administrator seven years ago. She narrowly avoided prison after being caught stealing £13,000. Speaking on This Morning today, she said that although she appeared jovial on screen, Channel 4 did not do enough to show how bad her condition is. She said: 'It's a horrible stigma, depression - just because you suffer from depression, you don't suffer from it twenty four hours a day. They (Channel 4) were let into the house when I was sleeping, so they did see both sides of it. And in reality they could have put more of that out.' She added: 'It started off as a bereavement depression when I lost my mum - the most important person in my life - was just gone.' The mother, who has children Gerrard, . seven, and Caitlin, 16, also said that she appeared on Benefits Street . thinking it was going to show off the community spirit in James Turner . Street where she lives. 'I think we went into it very naively to be honest,' she said. 'Obviously . we went into it believing it was community spirit - I know people are . probably sick of hearing us say that now - but we were told that how we . live were how children used to live years ago, where they could all play . out together, where we all helped each other, when someone is ill, . someone else looks after their children.'

It has been criticised by viewers for being unrealistic . Benefits Street 'star': Street matriarch White Dee, pictured with her daughter Caitlin, 16, who has been tipped to star on Celebrity Big Brother after her appearances on Channel 4 . She appeared on television today after accusing Channel 4 of 'manipulating' her and her neighbours during a live television debate on Monday. She said: 'You (Channel 4) spent up to 18 months, up to two years, to film people that were working, you filmed old age pensioners, you came to parties, you filmed open days, community spirit and boom (you showed)... five of us.' The single mother - who chewed gum during the live show - added that on-screen life on handouts was made to look like fun. 'It looks great, it looks like a right barrel of laughs. It looks like you are having a great crack,' she said. 'Obviously it is just a programme that they put together into 40 minutes that they had spent 18 months filming.' Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the mental health charity SANE, said that people with depression have good days and bad days. 'Mental illnesses like depression can fluctuate from day to day and the current way people are being assessed for benefits takes no account of the reality of these conditions,' she said. 'Our own experience at SANE is that most people with depression really want to work. But they are simply unable to take the stress of a full working week to overcome the exhaustion and debilitation which are symptoms of the illness. 'White Dee is right that this makes it exceptionally difficult for employers and potential employees who may not be able to fulfil the demands of a full working week. We need a benefits system flexible enough to protect both.'","White Dee has appeared live on Channel 4 debate and ITV's This Morning in the last three days .

"When the world's tallest water slide finally opens it will be, as this video shows, be absolutely terrifying. The Verruckt, German for ‘go insane’, will see its riders drop 17 storeys or 168-foot-tall - further down than if they were jumping off Niagara Falls. The opening date at Schlitterbahn Kansas City Waterpark was recently delayed for a third time by problems with the conveyor system that transports the four person raft to the top of the slide. Scroll down for video . The Verruckt was scheduled to open at Schlitterbahn Kansas City Waterpark in May but has faced repeated delays, now owner Jeff Henry has released video footage of him taking the plunge to prove that it is now safe for humans . The ride was originally due to open in May - but now the park is confident it will be open for business sometime during July . Henry has described the experience as 'the scariest thing [he'd] done', while Schooley has called it an 'extreme thrill' without comparison . The ride was originally due to open in May - but now the park is confident it will be open for business sometime during July. Co-owner of the park Jeff Henry has compared the experience of riding the attraction to 'jumping off the Empire State Building' and he should know, as newly released footage shows him and his head designer John Schooley testing out the slide. Initial trial runs around Memorial Day weekend had reportedly launched test sandbags into the air, but as this video shows the slide is now perfectly safe for humans. Depending on weight and weather conditions, the ride will travel at speeds between 45 and 65 miles per hour. The slide goes down a giant drop and then riders travel over a five-story bump before reaching the end.

'There is a three-second free fall before you get launched into a weightless situation for a few seconds, and then you come down like a roller coaster and have a long splash down.' Verruckt was certified as the world's tallest water slide in April by Guinness World Records. Waterpark spokeswoman Winter Prosapio had previously said they would not hesitate to delay operation for however long it takes to make sure the slide is safe. 'We'll take embarrassment before putting someone in the slide when it is not ready,' she said . No risks: A spokeswoman for the waterpark said they'd rather face embarrassment than risk injuries . Sunday's opening was to coincide with a one-hour special on the Travel Channel titled 'Xtreme Waterparks' documenting the designing and building of Verruckt. The slide's drop is so steep, it is almost at a right-angle to the ground and to get up to the top of it, thrill-seekers must climb 264 steps. There they wait for their turn on a deck made from railroad tanker cars before speeding down, up a five-storey hump and then back down a second slide into the final pool.

"Just shy: England captain Eoin Morgan's former mentor says the Irishman's decision not to sing the anthem is not political . England's Irish cricket captain Eoin Morgan does not sing the national anthem before matches as he is 'very shy', not because of politics, his former mentor says. The Dublin-born batsman, who switched from the Irish to the English side in 2009 and was made captain late last year, has stayed quiet as God Save The Queen has boomed out at the Cricket World Cup. While some have suggested his silence is because he is from Ireland, those close to the skipper say he is simply too shy to sing on camera. Asked why he has not been belting out the anthem before the Test matches in Australia and New Zealand this month, Morgan said it was 'a long story' and 'a personal thing'. Adding that he would not sing the Irish anthem either, he said at a press conference: 'It's pretty simple. I have never sung the national anthem when playing for Ireland or England. It does not make me any less proud to be an English cricketer. 'I am extremely proud to be in the position that I am in and privileged to be captain of the World Cup side.' Morgan's former deputy headmaster Kevin Jennings, who gave the cricketer a scholarship when he was 11 years old, told the Daily Telegraph that his decision not to sing was not political. He said: 'He’s a very shy fellow. I would imagine he’d be quite self-conscious singing in that context. I would say it’s as simple as that. He certainly wasn’t in the school choir. 'I’ve known him since he was 11 and he was always very quiet and reserved. Where he was confident was going out to bat. 'I know people could read something into it, but I don’t think it’s political. He certainly isn’t political to my knowledge.' The Dublin-born batsman has stayed quiet as God Save The Queen was boomed out at the Cricket World Cup . England rugby mascot Harry Westlake was described as a 'legend' by full-back Mike Brown for belting out the anthem before a Six Nations match this month . Mr Jennings, now retired, added that Morgan is 'well-mannered and polite but never an extroverted fellow. He wouldn’t overdo the chat. When I see him do these press conferences now I think, he couldn’t have done that seven or eight years ago. He must be coached for that.' Morgan's silence has divided opinion on Twitter, with some saying that the England captain should sing the national anthem. The England cricket team represents England and Wales and rules state that only British and Irish players can be picked. These British and Irishmen must be born in England or Wales, however they can qualify by residency, as Morgan did by living in Middlesex for four years. However during those years he was still allowed to play for Ireland, as they do not play full Test cricket like England do. Morgan was the third Irishman to switch allegiance, after Ed Joyce and Boyd Rankin. Until 1992, the England team also represented Scotland. Piers Morgan wrote: 'If you want to captain England, then sing the damn national anthem too.' But Gary Lineker defended the cricketer, saying: 'Not everyone is comfortable singing. Some do, some don't. Doesn't alter performance. 'I used to hate singing it. Still do. Mainly because I'm hideously bad. Don't understand why it's important.' England rugby mascot Harry Westlake was described as a 'legend' by full-back Mike Brown for belting out the anthem before the Six Nations match against Italy a fortnight ago. Six-year-old Harry could be seen singing with all of his heart before the match at Twickenham and his performance went viral on Twitter. Before the football World Cup in Brazil last summer, England Roy Hodgson demanded that his players sing the national anthem with pride. He said at the time: 'You very rarely play against opponents and they haven't got their hands on their hearts and singing their anthem as loud as they can. 'We are proud to be England players and, in my case, England manager, so when the national anthem comes up it's an obvious one for me that we sing it.'","England captain Eoin Morgan criticised for not singing national anthem .

"Newcastle midfielder Cheick Tiote has defended his lifestyle by claiming there is nothing unusual about having two wives and a mistress. Tiote, who earns £45,000-a-week at Premier League outfit Newcastle United, reportedly wed Laeticia Doukrou in a traditional ceremony this month, despite already being married to first wife Madah, 25. The 28-year-old, who currently lives with Madah and their two children in a £1.5million mansion in Ponteland near Newcastle, also has a one-year-old child with mistress Nikki Mpofu. Wife Number 1: Newcastle United star Cheick Tiote, with first wife Madah, is said to have taken a second bride . Wife Number 2: Midfielder Tiote, 28, who is a Muslim, has married Doukrou Laeticia in his native Ivory Coast . And the mistress: Nkosiphile Mpofu, known as Nikki, has a son, Rafael Tiote, by the footballer from Cote d'Ivoire . Newcastle midfielder Tiote played in Newcastle's 1-0 defeat against Stoke City on Monday night . His agent has confirmed reports he has married for a second time. Jean Musampa said: 'I can say that he did get married and that it is his second marriage. 'This is nothing unusual. He is a Muslim.' The footballer, who can have four wives under Islamic law, is also said to have insisted to friends that having several partners is commonplace in his native Ivory Coast. A source told The Sun: ‘He doesn’t see a problem with having two wives. ‘It’s perfectly acceptable in his culture. He doesn’t see he has done anything wrong and doesn’t know what the fuss is all about.’ It is reported that his 33-year-old Zimbabwean mistress Ms Mpofu recently ended her three-year affair with the footballer after he allegedly promised to make her his wife. Tiote reportedly says he 'doesn't know what the fuss is all about'. Right, the footballer appears in court in Newcastle last year charged with string of motoring offences . The Sun reported that she was ‘comfortable’ with him being married but decided to call the relationship off because he ‘used me like a mop’. She was pictured earlier this week leaving a Waitrose store in Ponteland, Newcastle, with her and Tiote’s son Rafael. Tiote was spotted a day earlier leaving his home in the same village with his first wife Madah, who is said to have forgiven him for marrying another woman. Newcastle United were not available for comment. Tiote received interest from Lokomotiv Moscow during the summer and was thought to be keen on a move to Russia. He remained on Tyneside after Lokomotiv failed to make an acceptable offer but his contract is set to expire in 2016. In October 2013 Tiote was lucky to avoid prison after admitting to possessing a fake driving licence, for which he was given a seven-month suspended sentence and 180 hours of unpaid community work. Judge James Goss said Tiote, 27, avoided jail only because he pleaded guilty and added: ‘I have no doubt that, using your considerable talent, you will be able to assist others in the community by encouraging them and passing on your skills that way.’ The Ivorian had to be called back to court after prosecutors forgot he should have been banned from driving after accumulating 12 points. Like MailOnline Sport's Facebook page. Polygamy was abolished in the Ivory Coast in 1964. Despite this, and the threat of six months to three years in prison or a fine, polygamy in west Africa is a very common practice. It tends to be more prevalent among the animist (a form of spiritualism) and the Muslim communities. In Senegal it was reported that nearly 47 per cent of marriages feature multiple women. It is legal in South Africa, Egypt, Eritrea, Morocco and Malaysia. In Iran and Libya it is legal with the written consent of the first wife. In other places it is illegal but the law is rarely, if ever, enforced. Some anthropologists believe that polygamy has been the norm throughout human history. In 2003, New Scientist magazine reported that, until 10,000 years ago, most children were fathered by a comparatively small number of men. Polygamous marriages may not be performed in the United Kingdom, and if a polygamous marriage is performed, the already-married person may be guilty of the crime of bigamy. Polygamous marriages legally performed in another country where the law allows it are not recognised for pension, immigration or citizenship purposes. It is estimated that there are as many as 20,000 polygamous Muslim marriages in the UK.","Cheick Tiote reportedly has more than one wife and a mistress .

"Mission: Sir John Sawers, the chief MI6, pictured, went to visit Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to urge him not to bomb Iran . The head of MI6 has made an extraordinary secret visit to Israel to urge Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to give the go-ahead to plans to bomb Iran, the Daily Mail can reveal. In an indication that the Government believes a strike on Tehran’s nuclear programme could be imminent, Sir John Sawers is understood to have made a personal mission to deliver a clear message that Britain is opposed to action now. It is unusual for the head of MI6, who is known in Whitehall as ‘C’, to make a foreign visit as an emissary of the Government, and still more so for details to leak. David Cameron is understood to have become increasingly concerned at the rhetoric from the authorities in Israel, who have been threatening unilateral military action to halt Iran’s nuclear drive. Mr Netanyahu and his defence minister Ehud Barak have been pushing London and Washington to take a tougher line against Iran amid growing concern about suspected nuclear sites. The issue has been discussed by the Government’s National Security Council, with some observers suggesting Israel may seek to strike before the US presidential elections in November, while the leadership in Washington is in a state of limbo. British fears about an imminent strike on Iranian nuclear facilities are said to have been heightened by Mr Netanyahu’s failure to provide clear answers to questions about Israel’s intentions. Sir John is thought to have met Mr Netanyahu and Mr Barak, as well as a number of Israeli security and diplomatic officials. He stressed that Britain believes there is still time for diplomatic and economic sanctions against Iran to succeed in deterring its hardline regime from developing a nuclear weapon. Britain, the US and Israel have long suspected that Tehran is trying to develop a nuclear bomb, in flagrant contravention of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Tehran has always denied any military motivation for the programme, claiming it is for civilian purposes. Foreign Office officials say there are signs that the latest sanctions, imposed in July to bar Iranian oil exports to the EU, are having a ‘serious impact’ on the Islamic republic. Sir John is thought to have suggested to Mr Netanyahu and Mr Barak that sanctions could be tightened yet further. However, his mission, thought to have taken place around two weeks ago, has failed to cool Israeli rhetoric. In comments which appeared to bring the possibility of an attack closer, Mr Netanyahu last night took the West to task for failing to act more decisively. Threat: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, pictured, has been pushing London and Washington to take a tougher line against Iran amid growing concern about suspected nuclear sites . President Obama's re-election bid could be derailed by a new war . He said: ‘The world tells Israel, ‘‘Wait, there’s still time’’. And I say, ‘‘Wait for what? Wait until when?’’ Those in the international community who refuse to put red lines before Iran don’t have a moral right to place a red light before Israel.’ On Monday, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Washington would not set a deadline in further talks with Iran, saying there was still time for diplomacy to work. Mr Netanyahu’s remarks came as diplomats said six world powers – including the US – were poised to voice ‘serious concern’ about Iran’s uranium enrichment programme and to urge Tehran to open up access to suspected nuclear sites. US Defence Secretary Leon Panetta said yesterday that Washington would have little more than a year to act to stop Tehran if it decided to produce a nuclear weapon. Mr Netanyahu has had a strained relationship with President Barack Obama over Iran and other issues, such as Jewish settlement building in the occupied West Bank. The website of Israel’s Haaretz daily newspaper said Mr Netanyahu’s remarks constituted ‘an unprecedented verbal attack on the US government’. Iran has threatened to retaliate against Israel and US interests in the Gulf if it is attacked, and President Obama’s re-election bid could be derailed by a new war. Mr Netanyahu added: ‘If Iran knows that there is no deadline, what will it do? Exactly what it’s doing. It’s continuing, without any interference, towards obtaining a nuclear weapons capability and from there, nuclear bombs.’ Downing Street, the Foreign Office, the British embassy in Israel and Mr Netanyahu’s office in Jerusalem refused to comment on Sir John’s mission. A security source said: ‘We would never discuss his travel plans or the reasons for it.’ Checks: Iranian nuclear power plants, such as this one in Bushehr, are under scrutiny .","British fears about imminent strike on Iranian nuclear facilities heightened by Israeli leader's failure to state country's intentions .

"Calls to boycott the 2018 World Cup in Russia would be 'empty-gesture politics' and would end up as a show of weakness, according to former sports minister Richard Caborn. European Union officials, reportedly with the backing of British Prime Minister David Cameron, are considering a move to call for a boycott of the tournament as a protest against Russian actions in Ukraine. Caborn was a leading voice in the sporting boycott of South Africa during the apartheid years but believes similar action against Russia would be ineffective and that - as happened with the 1980 Moscow Olympics when the USA boycotted but a British team still competed - there would be a global split. It's our turn: Calls to boycott the 2018 World Cup in Russia have been described as 'empty-gesture politics' Controversial: A boycott of the tournament would be as a protest against Russian actions in Ukraine . Frustrated, Fabio? Capello gestures during Russia's 4-0 win over Azerbaijan in Wednesday's friendly . Wait and see: FIFA president Sepp Blatter says the footballing body will not back moving the World Cup . He said: 'Politicians often think they can institute a boycott but that can end up as being a show of weakness not of strength. 'You'll end up having the world split down the middle as happened in 1980, and that is the worst of all worlds. 'No one condones what is going on Ukraine but it would be merely empty-gesture politics from those that did boycott the World Cup. 'The sporting boycott of South Africa worked because there was a total consensus between sports and politicians - but there is not at over Russia.' FIFA president Sepp Blatter has already made it clear that the world governing body will not move the World Cup. He said at the weekend: 'We are definitely holding the World Cup in Russia. We are in a situation in which we have expressed our trust to the organisers of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. (A boycott) has never achieved anything.' Cameron was part of the final push for England's failed bid for the 2018 World Cup and was furious that a number of FIFA members who had promised their vote reneged on their pledge.

"Mike Ashley does not want to sack Alan Pardew. He does not want to suffer the financial trauma of changing managers. Mike Ashley, however, does not want to be relegated. Likewise, he does not want to suffer the financial trauma of that sorry scenario (again). Alan Pardew has come under fan pressure following a poor start to the season but has the players' support . Mike Ashley does not want to sack Pardew and would be content to finish fourth from bottom in the league . To that end, if a mystic Magpie were to fly by the owner’s helicopter and reveal that, under Pardew, Newcastle would finish fourth from bottom, he would remain in charge. It’s a numbers game with Ashley - check his bank balance and you’ll see why. He is divorced from sentiment, stung - emotionally and financially -  by agreeing to the return of Geordie Messiah Kevin Keegan in 2009. So if Pardew, then, can guarantee Newcastle’s Premier League status and the cash bonanza to which survival equates, he will be OK by his paymaster. Mike Ashley was stung following the return of Geordie Messiah Kevin Keegan in 2009 . But would Pardew be happy with such an eventuality? A fortnight ago, on the eve of the home game with Hull, he held court with journalists at the club’s training ground, convincing us – and perhaps himself – that his was a cause worth fighting for. There was off the record, on the record, gusto and guts. In the subsequent match, his team were equally spirited, rallying to recover a two-goal deficit and claim a point. Four days later there was the League Cup win at Crystal Palace. Relief? Or merely a temporary reprieve? His demeanour in the wake of Monday’s 1-0 defeat at Stoke suggests the latter. For the first time, he looked like a man in need of a break. He has not lost the dressing room. On the contrary, senior players remain in support of their boss, both privately and publicly. Pardew still has the support of his players and the owner, but the fans are clear that they want him to go . Fans hold up signs calling for Pardew to be sacked as Newcastle lost again at Stoke on Monday night . If anything, though, that is something of a concern. For had there been discord behind the scenes, a change of coach could well trigger an improvement. But this lot – and you suspect Pardew knows this – simply aren’t good enough. This is a team without invention, identity, energy or endeavour, and for that he is in part culpable. But the manager does not have autonomy on transfers – far from it – and has been denied a goalscorer, the one commodity which masks the failings of others. He cannot speak out against the club’s transfer policy and the modus operandi of their soccermarket sweep of the continental aisle. Now that WOULD be a sackable offence. Peter Crouch's headed goal, which earned Stoke a 1-0 win on Monday, put yet more pressure on Newcastle . Instead, he has offered a whole host of reasons as to the team’s shortcomings in recent seasons – hence the now familiar chant, ‘Alan Pardew, it’s never your fault’. But perhaps now he’s had enough of it all – hands tied in transfer dealings, supporter unrest and venom hissed in his direction, no ambition from above and a squad which, no matter the man in charge, will lurk in dangerous waters until January at least. Does he attempt to paddle through until then? Or is he resigned to being taken by the current which runs against him? Either way, he will not abandon the liferaft to which he currently clings. But were Ashley to blow him out of the water, you get the impression it would save the manager from drowning. Perhaps now it is for the best.","Mike Ashley does not want to sack Alan Pardew .

'All I heard on the sidelines when I was growing up was about hard work and tackling. A good tackle would be applauded as much, if not more, than a great bit of skill. Tackling is a great part of the game. But, for me, the skill factor overrides everything else. 'The best players have the best skills because it’s something they’ve done all their lives in their own, original, unstructured ways. 'Look at Cristiano Ronaldo: unstructured street football as a kid. He just played and played because he loved to play.

Wayne told me a few times how coaches wanted him to play in one position and he refused, saying, ""No, I want to play here, because I’m the best and that’s what I’m doing.""

Gervinho was seen exchanging words with some supporters after the ball had gone out for a throw . Referee Clement Turpin spoke to Gervinho, both managers and a UEFA official about the incident . But Turpin was forced to to take both teams off the pitch amid concerns for the safety of the players in the 55th minute, following the controversial dismissal of Feyenoord's Mitchell Te Vrede for a challenge on Kostas Manola. The teams returned about 10 minutes later and almost immediately substitute Elvis Manu equalised for the Dutch side but Gervinho put Roma 2-1 in front three minutes later which was the final score, giving them a 3-2 win on aggregate. 'It was right to suspend play as we could have opened a shop with all the objects that were thrown from the stands,' Roma coach Rudi Garcia told Italy's Mediaset channel. 'It doesn't help the club, and I'll never cheer that,' Feyenoord coach Fred Rutten said. 'Those sorts of things only hurt Feyenoord. It's a shame it happened.' Roma fans who try to leave the old harbour in Rotterdam are stopped by police before the match . The first leg of the last 32 tie had been marred by crowd trouble and Rotterdam police were out in force . Roma fans were escorted from Amsterdam to Rotterdam by Dutch police in a bid to prevent trouble . Roma supporters were also transported by bus to De Kuip Stadium in Rotterdam . Around 2,7000 Roma fans had travelled to Holland for the highly-charged second leg of last 32 tie . Turpin also briefly stopped proceedings in the first half after an inflatable banana was launched onto the field. Rutten denied racism was at play. 'There is such a fuss made about it. I don't see it that way,' he said. 'We have different nationalities in our team. It's nonsense. We make too much of it.' It came a week after Chelsea were forced to apologise after video footage emerged of fans stopping a black man getting onto a train in Paris after a Champions League tie. The first leg of the last 32 tie had been marred by crowd trouble and Rotterdam police were out in force on Thursday night. Officers arrested 17 Dutch nationals and five Italians before the match. Police spokesman Gijs van Nimwegen said the fans were held for a variety of offenses, including fighting, possession of fireworks, and not following police orders. He said two people were found to be carrying knives, but could not say what nationality they were. 'It has been very busy for the police,' Van Nimwegen said. 'We have put a lot of energy into stopping fights. ... If we had done nothing, there could have been a lot of fighting.'

Feyenoord's (L) and Roma's players leave the pitch after the match was interrupted for second time . Former Arsenal forward Gervinho scored the winner as Roma secured a 3-2 aggregate victory . Police were bent on avoiding a repeat of last week's violence in Rome. Police on horseback led hundreds of Roma fans to Feyenoord's stadium for the late evening kickoff. Feyenoord fans rioted in Rome before the round-of-32 first leg, clashing with police, damaging a recently renovated fountain, and leaving part of the city's historic center strewn with beer cans and smashed bottles. The match ended 1-1, setting up a tense return leg. Police estimated about 2,700 Roma fans would travel to Rotterdam for the match at 50,000-seat De Kuip Stadium. A small number of Italian police who know the Roma fans were to be on hand to help their Dutch counterparts identify possible hooligans. Van Nimwegen said 83 Roma fans were denied entry into Amsterdam, and when they arrived in Rotterdam in two buses they were taken to a police station near the stadium and then taken directly to the stadium. Rotterdam Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb drafted an emergency order that police could invoke if hooligans begin rioting, giving police enhanced powers to detain fans and eject them from the city. Roma fans gathered around the city's historic old harbor and were kept segregated from Feyenoord fans. Buses were to transport them to the stadium ahead of the match. Dutch authorities have said they will support private fundraising initiatives aimed at helping to pay for the repair of the 400-year-old Fountain of the Barcaccia that was damaged last week in Rome. Aboutaleb says the hooligans responsible for the damage should ultimately be prosecuted and made to foot the bill.","Feyenoord's Europa League match with Roma was suspended early in the second half due to crowd trouble .

"A drunk who tried to squeeze under the glass wall of an ATM booth instead of using the door had to be rescued by baffled firemen. Passers-by in Zhejiang, an eastern coastal province in China, called the emergency services when they found the man stuck fast and unconscious after a night on the town. ‘We think he got in by the door but, for some reason - he was incapable of explaining to us at the time - he decided to get out through the small ventilation gap at the bottom of one of the walls,’ said fire service spokesman Hsin Ke. Scroll down for video . Tight spot: Firefighters rescue a drunk man in China who tried to squeeze under the glass wall of an ATM instead of using the door . He added: ‘He was well and truly wedged and unfortunately he was too intoxicated to follow our instructions on how to get himself out so we had to smash the glass panel to remove him. It is going to turn out to be a very expensive night on the town for this man.’ Police - who later identified the man as Cheng Kao - said: ‘He will be charged for the cost of repairing the booth.’ ‘He told us that he had entered the booth normally by using his bank card to authorise the doors to open and had gone to the cash machine to withdraw money. Bad idea: The man's bank card was swallowed by the ATM - then he decided to exit by crawling out . ‘But after inserting his pin number falsely three times, the cash machine swallowed the card. He said he was unable to open the door and thought the best way to get out was through the gap under the door.’ Earlier this year a man in China was left in agony for six hours after he trapped his arm in a filthy cesspit trying to retrieve his new mobile phone. Chen Ho was using the public lavatories in the city of Jianyang in Sichuan province and talking to a friend when the device slipped out of his hand and down the toilet. Connected to a deep cesspit, Chen rolled up his sleeves and fished around for the smartphone before his arm got stuck - sparking a six hour rescue operation.","Firemen had to cut the man free as he was too drunk to follow instructions .

"It was all going so well for Barcelona. Six games played and no goals conceded. The statistics laughed in the face of critics who said in the summer that once again they had failed to bring in the correct defensive reinforcements. Then they played a team with something approaching a world class forward line and the house of cards came tumbling down. Lucas Moura, Edinson Cavani and Javier Pastore is not the Europe's greatest forward line but it's a good few notches up on the Spanish league teams Barça have played so far and it was too much for a back four made-up of three full-backs (two of them who play like wingers, and one converted into a centre-back) and a holding midfielder, also converted into a centre back. Those flying full-backs Dani Alves and Jordi Alba were at fault for the first two goals. Alves conceded the free-kick for the first and Alba lost possession ahead of the second. The Brazilian gave the ball away 15 times and Alba 8 times as Barcelona lost possession 82 times during the game. Marco Verratti heads in PSG's second goal of the evening during the Champions League clash with Barcelona . Having not conceded in their opening six games of the season, Barcelona then shipped three in one game . 'I have seen a lot of Barcelona games and teams always create chances by getting in behind their advanced full-backs,' said Laurent Blanc after the game. Barça always played with a high full-back under Pep Guardiola but he was usually balanced out by a more defensive player on the opposite flank. Guardiola's Barça, at its best, had Alves on the right and Eric Abidal on the left. Alves AND Alba has long been one risk too many, especially against good teams. In the centre of defence it would be unfair to blame the Mascherano Mathieu axis – almost as unfair as when the French defender was confronted by an angry fan at the club's training ground last week over a bet the supporter had lost because Barça failed to beat Malaga; Mathieu didn't even play in the game. In truth both have been solid and developed a good understanding. Both have the pace to play the high line that suits Barca's pressing game but it's also true that neither is the young dynamic defender the club's supporters have long requested be signed. Barcelona play with an incredibly high defensive line which can leave them exposed on the flanks . Under Pep Guardiola, Dani Alves would attack while the left-back defended, but now both push forward . There was an attempt in the summer to sign Marquinhos but Barça were priced out of the move. Late on in Tuesday's game he made the last gasp save from Jordi Alba that made sure of all three points. His wild celebration – as if he had scored – was telling. He had shown on the night that he was worth the money Barcelona were unable or unwilling to pay for him. Alongside him was David Luiz who had also been on Barcelona's radar and in the stands was a watching Thiago Silva who was the original 'missed target' as they have failed to sign a top defender despite the obvious need. Neymar and Lionel Messi are on form for Barcelona but without an improved defence they will struggle . This was arguably the first time this season that Barcelona had faced an attacking line-up with real quality . One top defender who is at Barcelona is Gerard Pique but he has only started two games all season and is evidently not in Luis Enrique's first choice XI. On his own recent admission he is not the majestic all-conquering defender of old and is currently third choice. With Pique back to his best and either Mathieu or Thomas Vermaelen at left back to give the back four more balance we may yet see Barça sort themselves out defensively. Settling on a keeper and bringing to an end the constant switching between Marc-Andre Ter Stegen and Claudio Bravo may also help. Until such time they will continue to be picked off by Europe's best attacking teams. They can't win the Champions League if when Messi and Neymar score at one end, chaos continues to reign at the other.

Speaking to Savannah Guthrie, she added that she was shocked when she watched her husband's latest interview with CNN, in which he sparked more controversy by saying Magic Johnson had done nothing to help the African-American community. He made a series of disparaging remarks about Johnson's HIV-positive status - mistakenly saying he had AIDS - dismissing his work in charity and business and saying he's not a proper role model. 'What kind of a guy goes to every city, has sex with every girl, then he catches HIV?' he said. 'Is that someone we want to respect and tell our kids about? I think he should be ashamed of himself. I think he should go into the background. But what does he do for the black people? He doesn't do anything.' Shelly told the Today show that she would stunned by the interview.

"Cristiano Ronaldo goes in search of the all-time European Cup goalscoring record in Bulgaria’s Vasil Levski stadium on Wednesday with coach Carlo Ancelotti admitting: 'He is the best player I have ever coached.' The words of praise came with Ronaldo just three goals from Raul’s Champions League scoring record of 71. The man Manchester United fans tried to tempt back with a 20ft banner and a light aircraft at the weekend has 68 Champions League goals and is homing in on the former Real Madrid captain’s haul. Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo is closing in on Raul's European goalscoring record . Former Manchester United ace Ronaldo is currently three goals behind former Real Madrid striker Raul . 1. Raul - 71 goals . 2. Cristiano Ronaldo - 68 . 2= Lionel Messi - 68 . 4. Ruud van Nistelrooy - 56 . 5. Thierry Henry - 50 . 6. Alfredo Di Stefano - 49 . 7. Andriy Shevchenko - 48 . 8. Eusebio - 46 . 8= Filippo Inzaghi - 46 . 10. Didier Drogba - 42 . For mere mortals the gap might be too big to bridge in one match but having already scored 25 hat-tricks in his career Ronaldo has a chance to equal that other famous Madrid No 7 on Wednesday night. Messi is also chasing down the record and drew level with his footballing nemesis after scoring against Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday. Ronaldo overtook Messi last season scoring 17 goals in 11 games in Real’s Champions League-winning campaign, including a penalty in the final. He has scored 53 goals in 52 games in Europe for Madrid, vastly improving his average at  United. Ancelotti joked before the game. 'His greater strike rate is all down to me playing him in a position where he can score more goals he knows that.' At the weekend Ronaldo made a mockery of the idea that he might be slowing down as he approaches his 30th birthday by breaking the 20mph barrier in his run that led to Real's second goal on Saturday. Madrid doctors believe he is back operating at the same speeds as before the injury problems that marred his end to last season and also inhibited him during the World Cup. He has had difficulties with his left knee and his left hamstring and he has already missed one game this season – Real Madrid’s away defeat by Real Sociedad. But the sprint against Villarreal seems to suggest he is back to his explosive best. Carlo Ancelotti has said Ronaldo is the best player he has ever coached during his managerial career . Barcelona's Lionel Messi has also scored 68 goals in Europe after he netted against Paris Saint-Germain . It’s not the first time this season he has shown his athletic prowess – he leapt to over 2.6 metres for the headed goal he scored in Real Madrid’s 8-2 win over Deportivo recently. It’s little wonder United fans keen on his return don’t seem too worried about the fact that he will turn 30 next February. His goal at the weekend meant he had reached 10 goals in a league season earlier than any player in the club’s history and faster than anyone in La Liga since Pahinho for Deportivo in 1954. Madrid’s opponents Ludogorets nearly took a point from Liverpool in their opening group game and play their first home match in the Champions League. They do so without genuine home advantage, however, because their 6,100 capacity Ludogorets Arena does not meet UEFA’s minimum requirements and so they must play 324 km away in the national stadium in Sofia. Around 5,000 fans will make the five-hour trip to watch their team and many of the the remaining 40,000 tickets have been snapped up by Bulgarian supporters in the capital as anxious to see Ronaldo as they are to see how Ludogorets fare.

"A 24-year-old woman has up to 50 orgasms a day due to a rare medical condition which leaves her constantly aroused. Amanda Gryce, who suffers from Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder, says the condition has almost  ruined her life. Her uncontrolled orgasms can be triggered by anything from riding in a car to a loud bass. Scroll Down for Video . Amanda Gryce, with boyfriend Stuart Triplett, suffers from Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder - meaning she can orgasm uncontrollably up to 50 times a day . Miss Gryce said: 'It can happen anywhere and sometimes I'll have five back to back. 'It's not pleasurable - it has become like torture. I've been living with it since I was six.' For years, she suffered in silence, too ashamed to tell friends or family. She said: 'I can have 50 orgasms in one day and five or ten within an hour of each other. 'It happens when I'm with my friends or out in public and it's very embarrassing. Miss Gryce suffered in silence for years because she was too ashamed to confide in friends, family or a doctor . 'It kills me inside. I just have to put on a smile and pretend that nothing's wrong.' Once at the point of despair, she is now turning her life around after finding love - and much needed medical treatment, after battling doctors who didn't understand PGAD or how to treat it. Miss Gryce said: 'Since last year I've been on a quest to find out more about this condition. 'It's been one disappointment after another thanks to the reluctance of some doctors to see this as a valid condition.' But after making contact with pelvic pain expert Dr Robert Echenberg, she hopes she has found a way to control her orgasms. Miss Gryce said: 'After seeing Dr Echenberg I found there are things which can . reduce the intensity of the orgasms - even though they are still . constant. 'I take medication to numb the areas and do exercise to try to take me mind of it.  Taking control over the disorder rather then it controlling me is a dream come true. However, under doctors' orders, Miss Gryce and her boyfriend Stuart Triplett, 22, must abstain from sexual contact. The couple met seven months ago on a dating website. And despite previously having sex to cope when her symptoms were bad, she must now stay celibate. She said: 'It was difficult at first to explain my disorder to Stuart. I wasn't sure when was the right time or how he was going to react. 'But he's so supportive, he completely understands and he is just my rock. Since seeking help a year ago, Miss Gryce is slowly getting her condition under control. She also has treatment from physical therapist Gina Parsons (pictured) 'Stuart's really been holding me back as far as the intimacy goes - he actually has to remind me we're not allowed to do anything.' Recently Miss Gryce visited physical therapist Gina Parsonis in Clearwater, Florida, . who examined how her body reacts to the condition. She also performs meditation and stretching excersises to keep her episodes under control. Now Miss Gryce and Mr Triplett hope to move in together and plan their future. The couple must also abstain from sex until she gets her condition under control - something that meditation can help with . He said: 'I suppose you could say it was love at first sight with Amanda. Dealing with her symptoms at first was kind of a challenge, because I didn't quite know how to approach it the right way. 'As far as the sex ban goes, it was kind of hard to cope with but then I realised that it's important to her health that she doesn't do this so I've been able to abstain as well as her. 'I'll continue to do whatever I can to support her.' Miss Gryce added: 'This past year has been amazing. Meeting Stuart and Dr Echenberg, I finally feel like I'm going to have a more normal life - and eventually a positive sex life.' Dr David Goldmeier, an expert on sexual medicine at Imperial College in London said: 'Persistent genital arousal disorder is a newly recognised condition, where the sufferer complains of long periods of genital arousal that are not associated with sexual desire. 'PGAD sufferers experience intrusive, unsolicited and spontaneous genital arousal that can be unrelenting. This arousal can persist for hours, days or even longer. 'This can be highly distressing for a woman and despite attempts to relieve it with sexual activity or orgasm, this often doesn't help or can worsen the symptoms. 'Spontaneous genital arousal is quite common but it's those women who can't control the arousal which is uncommon. 'I see around 20 women a year with this condition, it may be as common as one in 100 we just don't know. 'Sometimes it may resolve on its own, there is no cure but there are a number of ways to manage the symptoms such as meditation and pelvic floor exercises along with pain medication for the patient.'","Amanda Gryce, from Florida, suffers Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder .

"It is one of the most polluted countries on earth. So it may come as little surprise that the latest fad in China is literally offering its city dwellers a breath of fresh air. Numerous fresh air stations have been set up in some of China's most polluted cities. The stations are stocked with individual air bags which provide users with pollution-free fresh air. And they have proved to be a big hit with one air station in Zhengzhou city in central China's Henan province which was inundated with visitors.

Uniformed air hostesses hook up visitors to oxygen masks so they can breathe air sourced from the Laojun Mountain scenic spot in Luanchuan county, which is 80% green land, in Henan province. There was no shortage of takers as locals flooded to enjoy the free fresh air. User Feng Lin, 75, said: 'The air is really good, but the time is too short. I had to stop too soon but it was really great until then.' It comes after just three of China's 74 cities met the official air quality standards, according to the Ministry of Environmental Protection in China .

The . air stations follow on from last week when costumed characters called . Oxygen Babies were giving away air bottles filled with air collected at . the Tianmu mountain scenic spot in the county of Linan in Zhejiang . province. The Oxygen babies have been touring the country, promoting the new products, which are currently free of charge, and were pictured in the city of Hangzhou in east China's Zhejiang province. Product manager Long Peng said: 'The air in Tianmu mountain is so fresh that negative oxygen ion is 3,300 per cubic centimetre, much higher than the normal level. The problem is that there are not enough negative ions in daily life. All the modern things we have generate an over abundance of positive ions that make us feel tired, depressed and irritable.' Capturing air: Bottled air pictured being collected at the Tianmu Mountain scenic spot in Linan county in Zhejiang province . Bottled air is proving to be a big hit as new figures show that just three of the 74 cities in China meet official air quality standards . But in Laojun, where the air bags are . being distributed, park managers say the average negative oxygen ion is . 30,000 per cubic centimetre. In some places on Laojun Mountain, the . average negative oxygen ion can be 50,000 per cubic centimeter. The . inspiration for the idea reportedly came from tourist shops near Mount . Fuji in Japan, where cans of fresh air have been a huge success. During a National Congress meeting, China's president, Xi Jinping, suggested Guizhou 'sell cans in the future', adding: 'Air quality is now a deciding factor in people's perception of happiness.' However, it's not the first time bottle air has gone on sale in China. Last year, Chen Guangbiao, who made his fortune in the recycling business and is a high-profile philanthropist, claimed to have sold 10 million cans in just 10 days, as pollution levels reached a record high. The move comes after the country's biggest online travel agency and insurance firms joined forces to offer policies to tourists whose trips are blighted in being visually impaired by the pollution.

"Barcelona legend Xavi will break a Champions League record when he makes his 143rd appearance in the competition against Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday night. The 34-year-old midfielder will surpass former Real Madrid icon Raul, with whom he is currently level on 142 appearances. Former Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs made 151 appearances, but 10 of those were in qualifying rounds. Having won Europe's most prestigious club competition three times with Barcelona, he deserves to be considered one of Champions League's all-time greats. Here is our list of the top 10 Champions League players (and there's no room for Zinedine Zidane). Raul - 142 . Xavi - 142 . Ryan Giggs - 141 . Iker Casillas - 141 . Clarence Seedorf - 125 . Ryan Giggs - 151 . Xavi - 148 . Raul -144 . Iker Casillas -143 . Paolo Maldini - 140 . 10: EDWIN VAN DER SAR (Ajax and Manchester United) Winner: 1995, 2008 . Van der Sar was the calm, unflappable figure in goal when Louis van Gaal's extremely young Ajax side caused the biggest upset in the competition's history by overcoming the mighty holders AC Milan. More than a decade later, the goalkeeper's place in Champions League history was assured when he saved Nicolas Anelka's spot-kick in Moscow to earn Manchester United their third European crown with victory against Chelsea. Fittingly, Van der Sar's illustrious career ended with a Champions League final, though this time he was helpless to prevent United from losing 3-1 to Barcelona at Wembley in 2011. Edwin van der Sar won the Champions League with Ajax in 1995 and Manchester United in 2008 . The Dutchman saved a decisive penalty from Nicolas Anelka in the 2008 Champions League final . 9: CLARENCE SEEDORF (Ajax, Real Madrid and AC Milan) Winner: 1995, 1998, 2003 and 2007 . The only player to win the Champions League with three different clubs, Seedorf was the midfield glue that helped some of the world's greatest players get their hands on the famous trophy. The Dutchman was just 19 when he helped Ajax beat AC Milan in 1995. Three years later, he helped Real Madrid end a 32-year wait for European glory by beating Juventus 1-0. But it was at Milan that he enjoyed his greatest successes. He was part of the side that defeated Juventus on penalties at Old Trafford when Andriy Shevchenko converted the decisive kick and, after losing to Liverpool in 2005 (more of which later in the countdown), he won a fourth title by defeating the same opponents 2-1 in 2007.

Clarence Seedorf is the only man to win the Champions League with three different clubs . 8: IKER CASILLAS (Real Madrid) Winner: 2000, 2002, 2014 . He may be receiving criticism in the latter stages of his career but nobody can deny Casillas in his place among the all-time greats. To win three Champions League trophies, spanning 14 years, is an incredible achievement and it might be a long time before anyone repeats it. And of course he's still going. The Spaniard was just four days past his 19th birthday, extremely young for a top-class goalkeeper, when he kept a clean sheet in the 2000 final against Valencia. He was one of the few to survive into the Galactico era, keeping goal when Zidane memorably won the 2002 final, and then went beyond the post-Galactico era and played in last May's 4-1 win against Atletico Madrid for La Decima.

Casillas kisses the trophy after Real Madrid's win over Atletico Madrid in the 2014 final in Lisbon . 7: STEVEN GERRARD (Liverpool) Winner: 2005 . Gerrard hasn't got the multiple medals of others in the top 10, but none of them have dominated a final like he did in 2005, when his man-of-the-match performance helped create The Miracle of Istanbul, a match so famous it's been turned into a film. With Liverpool 3-0 down at half-time to AC Milan, Gerrard scored the opening goal of a miraculous comeback with his head, and ended up playing at right back to ensure his side, far weaker than the Italians man-for-man, reached extra-time and penalties. Previously, Liverpool had only qualified for the knockout stages after his thunderous late strike against Olympiacos at Anfield had staved off elimination. And he is still doing the business now, his last-minute penalty against Ludogorets gave Liverpool victory in their opening group game of the 2014 campaign two weeks ago. Steven Gerrard (right) and Jamie Carragher (left) kiss the trophy after a miraculous win in Istanbul . Gerrard scores arguably his most famous goal against Olympiacos at Anfield in 2004 . The Liverpool captain's goal four minutes from time took his side through to the knock-out stages . 6: XAVI (Barcelona) Winner: 2006, 2009, 2011 . Despite the spellbinding feats of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, this period of world football will be go down as the Xavi-Iniesta era, where they helped Barcelona and Spain dominate with a passing philosophy known as 'tiki-taka'. Xavi was an unused substitute when Barcelona beat Arsenal in the 2006 final but three years later he was an integral part of their midfield in the defeat of Manchester United that prompted Ronaldo's exodus to Spain. In 2011, he was majestic as the Catalans again got the better of Sir Alex Ferguson's side. Now 34, Xavi's consistency, both in terms of keeping the ball and producing season-on-season, are unsurpassed and he will be a worthy record-breaker when he plays his 143rd Champions League game. Xavi has won the Champions League with Barcelona three times - in 2006, 2009 and 2011 . Xavi skippered Barcelona and ran the midfield in the 2011 final victory against Manchester United . 5: RAUL (Real Madrid and Schalke) Winner: 1998, 2000, 2002 . Holds the record for most goals and appearances in the Champions League, though the latter is about to be eclipsed by Xavi. Raul was the King of Madrid as they recaptured the glory years of Ferenc Puskas and Alfredo Di Stefano when the competition was called the European Cup. He won the trophy three times in five years against Juventus, Valencia and Bayer Leverkusen, the highlight coming at Hampden Park in 2002 when he scored the opening goal against the German side in a match ultimately won by Zidane's stupendous volley. Real Madrid legend Raul is the top scorer in Champions League history with 71 goals to his name . 4: RYAN GIGGS (Manchester United) Winner: 1999, 2008 . The only United player who appeared in both finals of Sir Alex Ferguson's Champions League-winning teams. In 1999 against Bayern Munich, he unselfishly played on the right-hand side to accommodate the left-sided Jesper Blomqvist in a United reshuffle forced by suspension to Roy Keane and Paul Scholes. Nine years later against Chelsea in Moscow, Giggs converted United's last penalty in the shoot-out that preceded Anelka's crucial miss. Giggs has played more Champions League game than anyone else if you include qualifying rounds (148), but it's as much to do with respect as statistics that he commands a place in the top 10. The Welshman has become a byword around Europe for sportsmanship, as another United great Sir Bobby Charlton was before him, a reputation underlined when he was applauded by Real Madrid fans in the heat of a tense battle. Ryan Giggs was part of Manchester United's Champions League winning teams in 2008 (left) and 1999 (right) 3: CRISTIANO RONALDO (Manchester United and Real Madrid) Winner: 2008, 2014 . Scored in victorious finals for two different clubs – and ended up being crowned World Player of the Year on both occasions. Ronaldo's header for United against Chelsea in the 2008 final changed any perception that he was a flat-track bully and unable to produce on the big occasions. Six years later, he was the talisman as Real won a record 10th European Cup against Atletico Madrid in Lisbon. He already has 68 Champions League goals, three behind Raul's record, and as he hasn't yet turned 30 it is only a matter of time when he passes that milestone, though Lionel Messi is also breathing down his neck on 67. Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates his goal against Atletico Madrid to help Real Madrid win 'La Decima' The Portugal superstar also scored in Manchester United's 2008 victory against Chelsea in Moscow . 2: PAOLO MALDINI (AC Milan) Winner: 1994, 2003, 2007 . Played in no fewer than six Champions League finals – and also won the European Cup twice in the 1980s before the competition changed format. The ultimate Italian defender, tough and resilient, Maldini's finest hour came in 1994 when Milan produced arguably the best performance in tournament history by thrashing Barcelona 4-0 without their first-choice centre-back pairing of Franco Baresi and Alessandro Costacurta. As captain, Maldini also helped Milan recover from the shock of losing a 3-0 lead to Liverpool in Istanbul – where he scored the opening goal - to beat the same opponents in the 2007 final. Paolo Maldini has won the Champions League three times, but also won two European Cups in the 1980s . 1: LIONEL MESSI (Barcelona) Winner: 2009, 2011 . On course to smash all Champions League scoring records. Messi has already hit 67, four fewer than Raul and one behind Ronaldo; but at the age of 27 he could become the first player to net a century of Champions League goals. In the biggest head-to-head between the world's two best players, Messi completely outplayed Ronaldo when Barcelona met United in the 2009 final in Rome. He even scored with a rare header from Xavi's cross. Two years later, he scored again when Barcelona beat United 3-1 at Wembley, their ultimate European performance. But the reason Messi is marginally ahead of all the other great players listed is because of the way he has transcended the sport with his brand of magic. The Argentine has the quickest feet in the history of the game and is the figure that has given the Champions League its own sense of excitement. He may not have won the World Cup like Diego Maradona, but Maradona never won the European Cup and Messi has helped make the Champions League the glamorous institution it is today. That is why he is No 1. Like MailOnline Sport's Facebook page. Lionel Messi has won the Champions League three times already with Barcelona at the age of 27 .

"CSKA Moscow may have been forced to play their recent clash with Bayern Munich behind closed doors, but that didn't stop a group of German fans from attending.

"Rapid Vienna have invited fans to help demolish their Gerhard Hanappi Stadium this Saturday, offering them the chance to unscrew seats, chisel away pieces of the walls and even cut out bits of the goal net to take home. The Austrian club are set to leave their home of 37 years and move into a new 22,000-seater stadium which is due to be completed in 2016. Prices at the 'Demolition Party' this weekend include 19.77 euros (£15.40) - the year the stadium was built - per seat and 18.99 euros (£14.80) - the year the club was founded - for a section of net.

Hanappi played for the club between 1950 and 1965 before becoming an architect. He planned the stadium, known initially as the Weststadion, and it was named after him following his death in 1980. The 18,500-capacity ground was renovated between 2001 and 2003 but the club have outgrown it and they will move to the Allianz Stadion in two years' time.

"France is resorting to selling off many of its most prestigious and valuable properties in a desperate bid to raise funds and keep its national debt under control. With France's total debt expected to hit almost €2trillion ($2.7trillion) by the end of the year and President Francois Hollande's government hoping to save around €50billion ($67billion) over the next three years, state-owned properties across the world are having to be offered up for sale. The latest property to go on the market is 1143 Fifth Avenue in New York - a stunning seven-floor, red brick and limestone block in central Manhattan once home to many of France's top U.S. diplomats. Up for grabs: This seven-floor apartment block in Manhattan, New York, which was once used to house  French diplomatic staff is being offered for sale for $32.5million . Covering 16,000 sq ft, the imposing block was built in 1923 and has an asking price of $32.5million (€24million). It consists of five apartments each boasting an impressive 1690 sq ft as well as a stunning eight-room duplex offering a huge 2712 sq ft. Viewings are understood to have started in April and it is believed that a buyer has already been found as the official authorisation for the sale was granted last week by France's Office Journal, the Daily Telegraph reports. It follows the sale earlier this year of the luxurious 18-room French ambassador’s residence at 740 Park Avenue which was reportedly snapped up by an American financier for a cool $70 million (€52 million). Once dubbed the world's 'richest . apartment building' the block was once home to Jacqueline Kennedy and . John D Rockerfeller. The 18-room, 7-1/2 bath duplex apartment featured . five fireplaces was reportedly used to host parties on an almost daily . basis.

New . York City socialite Elizabeth Kabler reportedly upended the sale . because she didn't like the idea of a French ambassador moving in and throwing too many parties. Fearful . of too many guests, constant entertaining and of a neighbor who fancies . himself above the law, Kabler waged a biter campaign to urge her fellow . stakeholders to block the sale of the 14-room co-op to French , or any . foreign emissaries.

The trend was started by the US government which sold its embassy in grosvenor Square to the Qatari royal family — for an estimated £500 million. Canada recently sold its Mayfair embassy for £306milion - more than six times the value placed on it just 14 years ago. The Brazilian embassy, on Green Street, Mayfair, fetched £40 million, with one agent describing the diplomatic market as a 'goldmine'.","France's national debt expected to hit almost €2trillion by the end of the year .

"Bread has almost become synonymous with the word bloating and 20 per cent of Britons think they'd be better off without it. But they may nearly all be wrong - and staying away from bread could do more harm than good, a panel of experts has warned. They argue that research has shown bread produces less bloating than pasta, and what makes us fat is not the sandwich, but the filling. Unfairly maligned: Experts say bread doesn't cause bloating - but the fatty fillings many of us adore may cause weight gain . Moreover, while bread is often singled . out as a bloating culprit, the evidence continues to show that this is . more perception than reality. The list of celebrities who refuse to touch gluten is long. Gwyneth won't let it pass her lips and Madonna swears avoiding gluten is what keeps her young. Although 98 per cent of Britons say they . eat bread, many blame it for bloating and weight gain, and think they . would be better off going gluten-free. And while 20 per cent think it’s important to eat gluten and wheat-free, just 0.5 per cent of the population has gluten intolerance. This means many could be losing out on vital nutrition such as fibre, iron and calcium by avoiding bread. Banned by the A-list: Many celebrities, such as Madonna and Gwyneth Paltrow, claim they maintain their trim figures by avoiding gluten-containing products, such as bread . In fact, gluten free products can . actually be higher in additives, saturated fat and sugar, Ayela Spiro . from the British Nutrition Foundation, told a London conference of . dieticians and nutritionists discussing bloating this month at King's College London. She also cited a new (as yet . unpublished) study from the University of Bristol, which showed bread . produced less physically measurable abdominal bloating than a pasta . meal, despite diners saying they expected the bread would bloat . them more. Sue Baic, of the British Dietetic Association, added it is a common misconception that bread is fattening - 'it's what goes on the bread that is most harmful to our waistlines,' she argued. Hidden enemy: Fatty sandwich fillings such as egg mayo are more likely to cause weight gain than the bread that surrounds them, experts say . Two . average slices of bread provide around 190 calories and 2g of fat, but spreading margarine or butter on them almost doubles the calories . (334 calories) and adds 16g fat. Furthermore, the . nation’s favourite sandwich filling – egg mayonnaise – provides just under . 600 calories and a huge 34g of fat, which is almost half the recommended . daily intake for a woman. Ms Baic added that many people assume white bread is bad for us, but this is not the case, saying: 'The half and half types such as Hovis Best of Both, that look . and taste like white but combine white and wholemeal flours can contain . 75 per cent of the fibre content of wholemeal.' 'As well as being a good source of calcium, iron and fibre, two slices . of bread contain 20-30 per cent of our recommended nutrient intake of . vitamin B1 [and other vital nutrients]. 'At just 5-10p per two slice serving it’s a very . inexpensive way to get some good nutrition in your diet.' Lesser thief: Bread was found to be less bloating than a bowl of pasta . So if it’s not bread that causes bloating, what does? Gastroenterologist, psychotherapist and medical adviser to the IBS Network, Dr Nick Read said that 'bloaters' may just be more sensitive to the feeling of abdominal gas, but not actually produce more of it. 'Possible risk factors for bloating include obesity, anxiety or depression, being inactive, constipated or premenstrual, and, in those with irritable bowel syndrome, eating too many fermentable carbohydrate sources in general, not just wheat,' he added. For example, some people with IBS may react with bloating on consumption of wheat but this is possibly more likely due to the presence of fructans found in many foods including onions, artichokes, asparagus and leeks rather than gluten, the panel concluded.","Britons falsely blame bread for bloating and weight gain .
One fifth of Britons believe they would benefit from avoiding bread .
While 5% claim to be gluten intolerant, true number is 0.5% .
Bread contributes almost a fifth of the nation’s intake of calcium and magnesium, 15% of our daily iron intake and 20% of our fibre ."
"As recently as March Fabian Delph addressed his England chances as a welterweight might think about beating a fighter of heavyweight class; hopeful, but not investing too much faith. The Aston Villa midfielder, a big boxing fan, had just scored a delightful back-heeled winner against Chelsea but in typically humble, matter-of-fact manner rowed back from suggestions that Roy Hodgson could come calling. ‘It’s every players’ ambition to represent their country,’ said Delph back then. ‘But I think I might be a bit away from that. There seems to be a lot of quality midfield players who are English who are above me at the minute. I’ll keep grafting and maybe one day.’ Big day: Fabian Delph will make his first start for England when they take on Switzerland on Monday night . Progress: Delph (second right) made his debut for Roy Hodgson's side in the win over Norway last week . Battle hardened: Delph played the last 20 minutes against Norway as England laboured to a 1-0 victory . That day has arrived quicker than he anticipated. After a promising cameo to win his first cap against Norway at Wembley, Delph is set to start in Switzerland as England begin their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. The retirements of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard edged the door open, while Jordan Henderson’s injury has widened it further. Delph, who may still play even if the Liverpool man recovers in time, is ready to stride through. It may seem like a remarkably quick rise to an important role but the Bradford-born midfielder, 24, has been earmarked for international honours ever since his days as a teenage starter at Leeds. It was there he would kick Gus Poyet during early training sessions – ‘He’d go crazy, speaking in Spanish to me. I learnt a few words I can’t use’ – and there he scored an outrageous goal from near the half-way line against Stockport County in December 2008. Arsene Wenger came close to signing Delph but ultimately it was Martin O’Neill who paid an initial £6million to take him to Villa in 2009. Just eight months later he ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee and was out for nearly a year. During that time he constantly questioned those treating him to the point where he is now called Doctor Delph by team-mates. ‘I like to know what’s wrong with me. I don’t just want to sit on the couch like a potato,’ he says. Delph’s game was put back though and little more than 18 months ago Villa fans wondered about his impact on the team. Sometimes there were jeers. But his resilience and talent saw him emerge and once fully fit he became the engine of Paul Lambert’s midfield, winning the club’s player of the year award last season. Flying in: Delph impressed as a teenager at Leeds having joined from Bradford as a youth player . Young gun: Delph spent three years at Leeds before moving to Villa where he took time to establish himself . A thunderous goal at Southampton was the highlight, yet it was his energy, work-rate, and positive passing that helped Villa arrest a slide that at one stage looked like it might end in relegation. This summer he took only one week off before employing a personal trainer to increase his strength. ‘The start of my career was dreadful,’ Delph admits. ‘Probably the worst injury you can get in football is your anterior cruciate ligament, I also did my lateral meniscus, and my medial as well. It’s been a tough road.’ There were long journeys in childhood too. Delph grew up in a council estate with little money and would travel a six-hour round trip to training at Leeds. Single mum Donna raised him and remains his inspiration. ‘We never had a car so we would get three buses and a train,’ he says. ‘My mum’s a massive influence, a great lady, a hard woman. She wouldn’t let me come with any excuses.’ Such an upbringing has formed Delph’s character both on and off the pitch. In interviews he answers straight and thoughtfully and often with northern humour. In midfield he is robust, but refined. The late tackles have become less frequent but there is an edge to his style. Philippe Senderos may provide Swiss opposition and is aware of Delph’s ability. 'He will bring his energy, his power, his will to move forward all the time,’ says the Villa defender. For the past months Delph has been getting acquainted with fatherhood alongside partner Natalie as they raise baby girl Sofia. Such maturity is bound to have an impact on his profession. He adds: ‘You never forget where you come from. I wouldn’t change anything from when I was a young lad. You learn a few things when you’re that age; to strive for better.’ Club call: Delph's impressive form for Aston Villa earned him a call-up to the England squad .

"The mystery of what happened to a historic Stradivarius violin stolen in a stun gun attack has been revealed as Milwaukee police recovered the instrument this week. The violin, built in 1715 by Antonio Stradivari and valued at $5 million, was found hidden in a suitcase in the attic of a man who had no idea the instrument was there, police say. The heist has been blamed in part on an art thief who once tried to sell a statue back to the gallery he had stolen it from. Scroll down for video . Recovered: The Lipinski Stradivarius was found hidden in a suitcase in an attic . Suspects: Salah Jones, left, and Universal Knowledge Allah, right, have been arrested over the theft . Three people have been arrested in the case, and Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn said there was no evidence of other 'shadowy' figures from the art world being behind the theft. 'It appears we had a local criminal who had an interest in art theft and was smart enough to develop a plan for a robbery,' Flynn said. 'Beyond that, we don't know what his motive was.' The violin, which police said appeared to be in good condition, was stolen last week from concert violinist Frank Almond, who was shocked with a stun gun. His attacker grabbed the violin and hopped into a waiting vehicle. Police traced the stun gun to Universal Knowledge Allah, a 36-year-old barber. A citizen's tip led police to Salah Jones, the 41-year-old convicted of stealing a $25,000 statue from a gallery at Milwaukee's Pfister Hotel in 1995. Officers had the men under surveillance before arresting them Monday, along with a 32-year-old woman who was later released from custody. Police also have not said what role each suspect had in the heist. Attack: Violinist Frank Almond, pictured with the instrument, was hit by a stun gun during the robbery . Relief: Frank Almond, concert master of Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, is delighted his violin has been found . Milwaukee District Attorney John Chisholm said Thursday that he expected to charge at least one of the suspects Friday. He said charges were delayed while prosecutors negotiated with one suspect for the return of the violin. On Wednesday night the suspect led police to the home of an acquaintance, who had allowed the suspect to store a suitcase in his attic. Concertmaster Almond thanked police for finding the violin so quickly, and expressed gratitude at the emotional support he had received from the community. 'It was truly heartening during what was obviously a very difficult time. I could not have imagined a better outcome for this particular chapter in the violin's life and look forward to having it in my hands as soon as possible,' he told the Chicago Tribune. It is not clear what the suspects planned to do with the violin. Such high-value instruments are almost always well-documented with photographs and easily identified, David Bonsey, a New York-based violin maker and appraiser who appears on Antiques Roadshow, said. 'There's virtually no place that a violin like this can be taken and fenced,' Bonsey said. 'You can't take it to a pawn shop.' Some art collectors will buy stolen objects that they keep hidden for their own enjoyment, Bonsey said. But Police Chief Flynn said there was no indication in this case of 'shadowy figures in the art world that were trying to purchase this' violin. The violin, known in musical circles as the Lipinski Stradivarius because it was once played by Polish violinist Karol Lipinski, has been appraised for insurance purposes at $5 million. Two Milwaukee police officers guard the rare violin after it was recovered . The rare Stradivarius, valued at $5 million, was stolen at the end of January . It has value as a musical instrument and as a work of art, Bonsey said. The violin is 'part of a body of work from someone whose work just cannot be imitated,' he said. 'A lot of people do sculptures, but there's only one Michelangelo.' Experts estimate 600 to 650 Stradivarius instruments remain - about half of what the master produced. One of the most famous is the Gibson Strad, owned by virtuoso Joshua Bell. It was stolen from Carnegie Hall in 1936 and not found until the violinist who stole it died in the 1980s. FBI special agent David Bass, an expert in art crime, said Stradivarius thefts are reported every few years but most instruments are found. A Stradivarius stolen from a South Korean musician in 2010 while she ate at a London sandwich shop was found about three years later at a property in central England. Three people were convicted in that theft. Attack: The violin was stolen from outside Wisconsin Lutheran College, where Frank Almond had been playing . The Lipinski Stradivarius was taken from Almond, concertmaster for the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, as he walked to his car after a January 27 performance at Wisconsin Lutheran College. Mark Niehaus, the orchestra's president and executive director, said the instrument appeared in good shape, but Almond, who also teaches music at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois has not yet seen it and had time to inspect it. The Lipinski Stradivarius was crafted in 1715 by Antonio Stradiveri. An early owner was composer Guiseppe Tartini, who gave it to his student, Salvini. Salvini passed ownership to Polish violinist Karol Lipinski. After Lipinski played for him, Salvini is said to have smashed the musician's violin, before handing him the Stradivarius and saying, 'Try this instrument'. After Lipinski's death in 1861 the violin was acquired by Engelbert Röntgen, and it stayed with his family for three generations. In the 1940s the violin was sent to Cuba, where it was owned by a supporter of the Havana Symphony. But after fleeing the revolution, the violinist was forced to sell the instrument so he could start a new life in the U.S. It was bought in New York in 1962 by Evi Liivak, an Estonian who played secret concerts to keep spirits raised during the Nazi occupation. In 2008, Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra's  Frank Almond was given the violin on permanent loan. Source: A Violin's Life . The violin was on loan to Almond by . its owner. Such arrangements are common in classical music in part . because most artists can't afford instruments worth millions of dollars. The owners benefit as well because use keeps the instruments in good . shape and can add to their value. 'When . famous people play these instruments it builds what we call the . instrument's provenance,' Bonsey said. 'It adds to the value of the . instrument down the road.' The violin had been previously owned by a string of high-profile musicians, including Devil's Trill composer Giuseppe Tartini, and Polish violinist Karol Lipinski. It had survived the Cuban revolution, . during which its sale helped a Havana musician escape to the U.S., and . was used in concerts across Europe by a woman who escaped the Nazis. Almond was offered the use of the violin in 2008, when a family . clearing the estate of a dead relative contacted the concertmaster to . ask his opinion of an instrument they had found. In an interview with The Violinist last . year, Almond recalled how he had at first been skeptical, saying . that he is regularly contacted by people who believe they have found a . rare instrument. After . meeting the owners, who showed him paperwork and old concert programs, . Mr Almond was led to a bank vault where the precious violin had been . stored for 20 years. 'It . turned out that they had put it in a bank vault - a regular bank vault . at M & I Bank, which happened to be about, I'd say, 100 yards from . the concert hall,' Almond said. 'It was ironic - I'd been playing all the time in this hall, and there was a 1715 Strad, down the street in a bank vault.' Craftsman: An illustration of Antonio Stradivari, who made the missing violin in 1715 . Origins: The violin's early owners included Giuseppe Tartini, left, and Karol Lipinski, right . Generations of music: The violin was also owned by Engelbert Rontgen, left, and Evi Liivak, right . The . violin had an impressive pedigree, and allowed Mr Almond to perform on . an instrument once used by 'godfather of modern violin playing' Tartini, and Lipinski. 'If . you start thinking about everything behind that instrument, it's easy . to feel quite tiny,' Mr Almond said in a previous interview. 'Sure, it . was creepy to play the Devil's Trill sonata for the first couple times. But that's what the violin is for: playing. 'It's going to be here a lot longer than I am, and every day that I'm able to play on it, to me, it's amazing.' Its last owner had been a child prodigy from Estonia, whose music studies in Budapest were cut short when her father was killed by the Gestapo. Evi Liivak was known for playing secret concerts in bunkers to raise the spirits of those living under Nazi oppression. She took possession of the violin in New York in 1962, when her husband, a Milwaukee pianist, bought it for $19,000 from a Cuban who was forced to sell it after escaping Havana. Its enticing history led Mr Almond to record A Violin's Life in tribute to it. The CD features him playing pieces that had been composed or were associated with its various owners in the past 300 years.","$5 million Stradivarius found inside suitcase in an attic .

"David Luiz became the first player to score against Barcelona this season as Paris Saint-Germain beat Luis Enrique’s side 3-2 in Paris. The French Champions have not been beaten at home in the Champions League since 2004 and their record continued in a five-goal thriller. PSG took the lead on 11 minutes and it was Luiz – a player linked with a move to Barcelona before he finally left Chelsea for Paris in the summer – who got the goal. Dani Alves was penalized for handball and Lucas Moura’s free-kick dropped to Luiz who swept it past Marc-Andre ter Stegen. David Luiz wheels away in celebration after scoring Paris Saint-Germain's opening goal in the 3-2 victory over Barcelona . Looking every bit a rock star, Luiz executes the perfect celebratory power slide after scoring the opener in Paris Saint-Germain's win over Barcelona . PSG: Sirigu, Van der Wiel, Marquinhos, Luiz, Maxwell, Verratti (Cabaye 71'), Thiago Motta, Matuidi, Lucas Moura (Bahebeck 91'), Cavani, Pastore (Chantome 86') Subs not used: Douchez, Bahebeck, Aurier, Digne .

Goals: Messi, Neymar . Booked: Dani Alves . Referee: Nicola Rizzoli (Italy) Barcelona had made enquiries to sign Luiz in the past and made a more concerted effort to sign Marquinhos. They were facing both players and it was Luiz who had put paid to perfect defensive record. Within a minute, however, the visitors were level. The luminous yellow shirts charged forward and Messi and Andres Iniesta played a wall pass inside the area with the Argentine finishing past Salvatore Sirigu for his 68th Champions League goal. Now only Real Madrid’s Raul has scored more and Messi had moved within three of the record. It was also Barcelona’s 500th goal in the European Cup. Messi created Barca’s next real chance with a lofted pass that Neymar stretched to reach ahead of Sirigu - he got there first but failed to keep this shot down. From so nearly taking the lead, Barcelona were soon behind again. Jordi Alba lost possession, PSG won a corner and from Thiago Motta’s kick Marco Verratti scored at the far post. It a owed plenty to fine delivery, but even more to Ter Stegen wandering off his line and failing to claim the ball as it sailed over his head it, leaving the goal at Verratti’s mercy. The old demons of not being able to defend set-pieces had undone Barcelona, with them conceding from a free-kick and a corner. The game remained ridiculously open in what was left of the first half – something that suited Luiz. The Brazilian exists somewhere between total football and total chaos. He had one run down the right wing, one run down the left wing, and there was some kamikaze defending, but he had scored one of the goals that sent his team down the tunnel leading 2-1 at half time. David Luiz takes a brilliant first touch in the box before turning and driving home his left-footed finish to give Paris Saint Germain the lead over Barcelona .

PSG were doubling up on Alba with Lucas Moura and Gregory van der Wiel down the Barca left and the home side’s full back crossed from the right for Blaise Matuidi to score the third. Barcelona repeated their first half trick of responding inside a minute with Alves’ cross was converted by Neymar to make it 3-2. Barcelona were still looking exposed at the back and both Edinson Cavani and Javier Pastore had the chance to extend PSG’s lead.

Barca coach Luis Enrique brought on Xavi for his 143rd Champions League appearance, sending him past Raul’s competiton record, as Ivan Rakitic, who had also been at fault for PSG’s second goal, beaten in the air by Verratti, made way. Barcelona’s best chance to salvage a point came with 15 minutes left when the ball dropped to Iniesta in space on the edge of the area. It was the same range he scored his most famous Champions League goal at Stamford Bridge in 2009. He even had the same colour shirt on but the shot was high and wide and the clock was now ticking down on Barcelona’s unbeaten start to the season. There were still two more big chances with Alba shooting from inside the area only for Marquinhos to throw himself in front of the goalbound effort and Barcelona substitute Munir El Haddadi to hit the post from distance. Marquinhos celebrated his block as if it were a goal, and PSG had their victory. PSG midfielder Blaise Matuidi celebrates after getting on the end of a cross to make it 3-1 in the hosts' favour .

"Amid the fuss about Jose Mourinho’s return to Lisbon, Nemanja Matic was forgotten. At least, he was until the 34th minute when the former Benfica midfielder appeared unmarked to head Chelsea into the lead. A less popular goalscorer it would have been hard to find inside Sporting Lisbon’s Estadio Jose Alvalade. Matic used to play for their fierce city rivals and returned to spoil their first Champions League home game in six years. Nemanja Matic (second right) proved the matchwinner for Chelsea, scoring the only goal in the 34th minute with a towering header at Sporting Lisbon .

Referee: Antonio Lahoz (Spain) Attendance: 40,734 . For Chelsea it was a vital goal, giving them a grip on a game they had dominated without managing to punish Sporting, with Diego Costa among those guilty of wastefulness, although not to the same degree as Andre Schurrle. Matic stepped forward to score his second of the season and his first Champions League goal for the club he re-joined in January for £21million. It clinched Chelsea three points and issued a reminder of how critical the tall Serb has become to Mourinho’s team. While Costa and Eden Hazard take acclaim for their work in front of goal, Matic supplies the midfield power which allows them to attack with such freedom. Amid all the fuss about Costa’s strike-rate and hamstrings and Hazard’s jinking dribbling skills, Matic is easily overlooked. Here was the perfect moment to hail his contribution for he is every bit as important as the goals of Costa or the jinking runs of Hazard. Sporting were very disappointing until they went behind. They appeared to freeze but generated more urgency and purpose in the second half, when Chelsea’s defensive unit had to work to protect the lead. Matic weighed in with some of the more familiar unsung stuff, eating up the miles, disrupting the game’s rhythms, winning the ball and the Londoners moved to the top of Group G with back-to-back ties next against Maribor of Slovenia, who drew at Schalke on Tuesday night. ‘We had to win,’ said captain John Terry after his 100th Champions League appearance. ‘It puts us in control again.’ Nani and Fredy Montero both went close in a closing phase which had no right to be as nervy as it was for Chelsea. They squandered the chances to win comfortably, starting in the second minute when Costa was released by Oscar. Costa stormed clear on goal with oodles of time, perhaps too much time, and opted for a low shot which Rui Patricio saved with his left foot. Patricio went on to perform brilliantly and Mourinho strode into his penalty area at the final whistle to offer his hand. Unlike Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert and his sidekick Roy Keane, Portugal’s No 1 shook it. ‘I’m not going to repeat what I said because the words would be censored,’ said the Chelsea boss. ‘It was something about spoiling the night.’ Diego Costa (right) had a glorious chance to put Chelsea ahead in their Champions League group match at Sporting Lisbon, but he saw his shot saved by Rui Patricio .

Nani and Mourinho shared brief pleasantries as the game unfolded on Tuesday night in the Portuguese capital . After thwarting Costa, Patricio frustrated Schurrle, who tried to sidle past him but the keeper scrambled across the turf to smother his shot. He saved again from Schurrle, a more routine catch from a header after Naby Sarr, who endured a torrid night, had been dispossessed, and again, to keep out a low strike from the edge of the box. It was shaping up like the Capital One Cup tie against Bolton when Schurrle had a dozen shots and could not score. Midway through the first-half he managed to screw an absolute sitter horribly wide. Mourinho spun towards the bench, throwing his hands in despair. He knew Chelsea must score during this dominant period. The chance was made by Hazard, who sped past Sarr and picked out Schurrle, arriving from deep, completely unmarked. All he had to do was roll the ball into the net but somehow he missed the target. Oscar (centre) wasted another glorious chance to double Chelsea's lead, seeing his shot saved by Patricio (right) when through on goal early in the second half . Nani's (right) influence grew in the second half as Sporting pressed for an equaliser against the 2012 winners .

Referee Antonio Miguel Mateu Lahoz (far left) booked the Sporting defender (centre) for the challenge - who had to be carried off on a stretcher as a result of his foul . Chelsea wastefulness kept Sporting in the game and Marco Silva had them drilled to break at pace and numbers. Thibaut Courtois was a bystander for much of the first-half but alert to save from Islam Slimani when he needed to be. Pressure was eased by Matic, when the Serb found space in a crowded goalmouth to apply a firm header to a free-kick delivered by Cesc Fabregas and looped over Patricio into the far corner. There were similarities to the winner scored by Branislav Ivanovic in the Europa League final against Benfica, when Matic was on the beaten team. Chelsea had a lead and went after the second, but it was no easier to acquire. Mauricio blocked from Costa, soon after the break, and Oscar was unable to beat Patricio when clean through on goal.

Another run by Costa was brutally halted by Mauricio, who managed to injure himself in the process. It might have been interpreted as a red-card foul by the last defender, but the referee gave him the benefit of the doubt and the centre-half left on a stretcher with a yellow. ‘It’s understandable, no problem,’ said Mourinho. ‘It is a young team, young players, a big match for them. There was some frustration because we controlled most parts of the game. The game was hard but correct.’ Sporting summoned some quality in the second half. They were spirited and much more threatening and almost found a way back into the game. Nani crashed his best chance into the site-netting from an angle and curled another close, while Montero flashed a header wide. Chelsea survived the scares and are well placed to win the group. ‘We can control our destiny,’ said Mourinho. ‘We play two games against Maribor and if we manage six points that would be 10 and job done.’","Nemanja Matic proved Chelsea's matchwinner  with a towering header on 34 minutes in Portugal .

"Rochelle 'Shelly' Sterling may be ready to let go of husband Donald Sterling, but she has vowed to fight tooth and nail to keep her share of the Los Angeles Clippers despite the NBA saying she would lose her share if he sold the team. The league issued a statement Sunday that her 50 per cent share of the team would be forfeited if team owners voted to force her husband to sell. She has repeatedly stated through her attorney and even in an ABC News interview that she would take any battle to retain her half of the team to court if necessary. Defiant: Shelly Sterling insists she has rights to her half of the team despite the league saying otherwise . 'Under the NBA Constitution, if a controlling owner's interest is terminated by a three-fourths vote, all other team owners' interests are automatically terminated as well,' the league statement explained. 'It doesn't matter whether the owners are related as is the case here. These are the rules to which all NBA owners agreed to as a condition of owning their team.' The philandering racial hatred-spewing owner's wife disagreed, and issued the following reply to the Los Angeles Times through her attorney Pierce O'Donnell. 'We do not agree with the league's self-serving interpretation of its constitution, its application to Shelly Sterling or its validity under these unique circumstances. 'We live in a nation of laws. California law and the United States Constitution trump any such interpretation.' Her defiant statement came shortly after she told ABC's Barbara Walters that she shouldn't be penalized for her husband's transgressions, and would do everything in her power to keep the team. Not welcome: Banished Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling attending the NBA playoff game between the Clippers and the Golden State Warriors shortly before he was barred from the league . 'I will fight that decision,' she said, adding the team is her 'passion,' and 'a legacy to my family. 'I've been with the team for 33 years, through the good times and the bad times.' She also admitted she plans to divorce the disgraced billionaire. The ABC interview was made public at about the same time Miami Heat forward LeBron James said the entire Sterling family should be banned from the league. The fiery soon-to-be-ex-wife of the NBA's public enemy number one also suggested he transfer his ownership stake to her name.' Her lawyer previously said that her legal team 'will fight vigorously to defend her property rights.' Donald Sterling's interest in the team is likely to be up for grabs after league commissioner Adam Silver banned him for life and fined him $2.5million after recordings of him angrily grumbling racial slurs at his presumed mistress V Stiviano were made public last month. He told CNN on Sunday that he will do everything in his power to keep control of the Clippers despite the league having already installed an interim CEO to run the team as it charges through the playoffs while trying to claim its first-ever NBA title.","Shelly Sterling would lose her share of the team if owners vote to force Donald Sterling to sell, the league announced Sunday .

"A Dutch colleague watching Louis van Gaal’s most recent press conference on the internet found it amusingly familiar. He recognised the facial expression that said Manchester United’s new manager was less than impressed with what he considered a challenge to his authority. Not to mention a tactic he often employs when he does not want to answer a question. He simply dismisses it as a poor one and moves on. As Van Gaal said after being asked if Wayne Rooney’s red card had made him doubt the wisdom of selecting the combustible Englishman as his captain, it was his ‘right’ to offer no response. Which it was. New Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal does not suffer fools gladly during press conferences . Van Gaal's temper is reminiscent of the way in which Sir Alex Ferguson ruled at Old Trafford . Ferguson would often dish out contempt to questions he didn't agree with during press conferences .

TOTAL: 13 major trophies . And on a weekend when Phil Mickelson demonstrated how destructive public criticism can be in a team environment, the Dutchman did himself no harm by displaying the kind of unity on which success at Old Trafford has long been built. If he was unhappy with Rooney for getting himself suspended for three matches in what promises to be a tough few weeks for a misfiring United side, he expressed that view in private. For what it’s worth, Van Gaal actually missed the point when it came to that particular enquiry about Rooney. Sometimes questions need to be asked in anticipation of a wider response and the days of debate that have followed Rooney’s dismissal for kicking Stewart Downing prove the point. Some of it has been hysterical, some of it rather surprising. Some of his fiercest critics have suddenly become his most vocal allies, pointing to the fact that three years had passed since Rooney’s last red card. True enough. But a red card only six games into his captaincy at United is a statistic that at least raises concern that the burden of responsibility might occasionally become too much for a player of Rooney’s volatile nature. That does not mean that Rooney is not the right man to lead United in these challenging times, particularly at a football club where the captain has often been an extension of a combative manager. There was a time when the same heart appeared to beat inside Sir Alex Ferguson and Roy Keane, even if Ferguson would now deny it and Keane will no doubt do the same when his new autobiography goes on sale next week. Wayne Rooney was sent off for kicking out at West Ham's Stewart Downing at Old Trafford last weekend . The decision to hand Rooney the captain's armband has been scrutinised over the last week . Van Gaal, however, brushed off questions surrounding his choice when asked on Saturday . The relationship between Van Gaal and Rooney is similar to that of Ferguson and Roy Keane . Van Gaal clearly sees something of himself in Rooney. It will be why he chose him. And while Rooney’s professional relationship with Ferguson might have ended much like Keane’s, he might see something of his former manager that he admires in Van Gaal, too. That press conference on Saturday certainly reminded me of Ferguson, even if it lacked the sheer explosiveness of some of Fergie’s more memorable encounters with the media. What made Ferguson so fascinating, in particular for the reporters whose job it was to see him ahead of every match, was his unpredictability. Sometimes he was mesmerising. Other times grumpy and disinterested. He might surprise you by suddenly appearing friendly; funny even. And then there were those moments when he could descend into a blind rage with venomous, personal attacks. On one particular morning he concluded his answer to the last question by telling the assembled reporters to ‘go away and write’ their ‘s***e’. Those who were there still laugh about it to this day. The Dutch journalists recall similar tales of Van Gaal, even if many of them have found him difficult to warm to over the years. In certain cases relationships have been eroded by the tone of the confrontation. Not because he might declare a question unworthy of a response but because of the way he then goes on the attack. He might inform a reporter that their opinion lacks credibility because they have not had the benefit of attending his training sessions all week. Ferguson addresses the media ahead of the 2009 Champions League final against Barcelona . He might even point to the fact that they have never played the game professionally - an argument that jars with every football fan - and therefore are not entitled to doubt him. ‘He can be funny, too,’ said my Dutch colleague earlier this week. ‘But he sometimes enjoys trying to ridicule you in front of your colleagues.’ At the World Cup in Brazil last summer certain reporters felt Van Gaal was too controlling. He had an excellent tournament where it mattered most, of course, guiding his country to the semi-finals, which was all the more impressive for the fact that he was not blessed with quality in every area of the pitch. But he limited his access to the official FIFA press conferences and that proved a frustration because those gatherings could be manipulated to silence certain journalists, essentially because the media officer decides who gets the microphone you require to ask a question. There were senior writers who were left deeply frustrated by the lack of opportunities to engage with their national team coach, particularly when the same reporter from a Dutch children’s TV show was invited to ask the final question every time. Ferguson and Rooney share a joke during training ahead of a Champions League semi-final in 2011 . So far here in Manchester there have been few such complaints. Reporters would probably consider Van Gaal’s press conferences a bit too brief. But for the most part he has been candid and accommodating, and if there have been flashes of that arrogance, aloofness and aggression it is only to be expected. These, after all, are characteristics a manager probably needs to lead a club like United, and were certainly employed to good effect when he followed that astonishing 5-3 defeat at Leicester by tearing into his players in the dressing room. As the faces Van Gaal encounters in his press conferences become more familiar, and he develops a greater command of English, there is sure to be more confrontation in that arena too. According to my Dutch colleagues, Saturday was fairly tame by Van Gaal’s standards. With some relish they often recall a clash he had with a Dutch reporter during his time at Barcelona when he objected to a question about Rivaldo. ‘You’re very bad,’ said a ranting Van Gaal. ‘Very, very bad. No, no, no, you’re very bad. Very bad! Always negative. Never positive. Always negative.’ Give him time, and a few decent results, and there will be plenty more echoes of Ferguson.

"‘I’m going into the bathroom to read.' Those were the words Elvis Presley uttered to his fiancée Ginger Alden in the early morning hours of August 16, 1977 at his Memphis mansion, Graceland. And they were the last words he would ever speak. The King couldn't fall asleep and he didn't want to disturb the beauty queen who was about to become his wife. ‘Okay, but don’t fall asleep,’ she responded, fearing he would zone out while sitting on the john. She  went to bed, leaving his reading light on for him when he returned. The King and I: Ginger Alden, Elvis Presley's last love, will tell her story in her book, Elvis and Ginger, to be published September 1.  The couple had a great time with friends on their last holiday in Hawaii before he died . Iconic Elvis: In the 1950's and 1960's he was the King of Hollywood as well as the King of Rock and  Roll . When Alden woke up hours later at 2 pm and noticed Elvis' reading light still on, she knocked on the bathroom door, called his name and opened the door. ‘That’s when I saw him in there’. In her upcoming memoir, Ginger and Elvis, due out September 2 from Berkley Hardcover, the still heartbroken Ginger, now 57, recounts some of the details of her short-lived life with Presley. She reveals she found him slumped over on the bathroom floor, on his knees with his hands beneath his face, in a grotesque position as though he had been praying. Ginger bent down to touch him to find his body cold, according to a review of the book by Kirkus Reviews. ‘I slapped him a few times and it was like he breathed once when I turned his head,’ she revealed in the only interview she has given to date. She tried opening an eye to see a cloudy blue pupil. ‘It was just blood red, but I couldn't move him.’, . ‘I didn't want to think he was dead. God wouldn't want to take him so soon’. She pressed the intercom in the bedroom at Graceland that rang in the kitchen and called for help. ‘Elvis has fainted,' she screamed. Beauty queen: With titles Miss Traffic Safety, Miss Mid-South and runner up Miss Tennessee University it's no wonder Ginger caught Presley’s eye . Elvis’s old army buddy and helpmate, Joe Esposito, ran up the stairs, rolled Elvis over and pounded on his chest to try to get him breathing, but rigor mortis had already set in. Elvis had died of poly-pharmacy - the use of multiple medications that are clinically unnecessary -  in his bathroom at Graceland. ‘His swollen face was buried in the red shag carpet, his tongue, nearly bitten in half, protruding from clinched teeth,' wrote author Alana Nash in her own well-documented biography of Presley, Baby Let's Play House. 'His beautiful skin now mottled purple-black,’ wrote Nash. He vomited and crawled a few feet before he died. It was not a painless death, according to Nash. If Elvis had called out, Ginger likely would not have heard him,'  Nash wrote. Elvis had called nurse Tish Henley, who worked for his personal doctor on site, Dr. George Nichopoulos, known as ‘Dr. Nick’, and asked her to bring up something to help Ginger sleep. Nash reports that Henley insisted she sent up one Dilaudid pill, a strong opiate, stronger than Ginger would actually require for the menstrual cramps she said she was suffering. In her memoir, according to Kirkus, Alden tells the chronological story of how she first met the King when she was five years old and her father was a Public Relations Officer in the army in Memphis. She met the music icon at a local fairground when Elvis recognized her father and walked over to say hello. He patted the little girl on her head. Fast forward to November 1976 when Alden’s sister, Terry, the reigning Miss Tennessee, was invited to Graceland to meet Elvis and her sisters, Rosemary and Ginger, went along. So in love: 'I know this sounds funny but when Elvis entered the room, I thought trumpets would sound. He looked so handsome,' Ginger revealed in an interview . Ginger, a local Memphis beauty queen with the titles Miss Traffic Safety, Miss Mid-South and runner up Miss Tennessee University was the one who caught Presley’s eye. Ginger gushed, ‘I know this sounds funny but when Elvis entered the room, I thought trumpets would sound. He looked so handsome. He quickly sat in a chair and started talking with each of us. It turned out to be a truly wonderful evening as he took us on a tour of Graceland. 'Later he sang for us and read aloud from some of his books about religion’. Alden was two decades younger than Elvis and twenty at the time when she got caught up in life at Graceland and he began showering her with presents of jewels, three cars including a Lincoln Continental, furs and promises his death would prevent him from keeping. Nash writes that Alden was a reluctant girlfriend who was put off by his drug use and still involved with a boyfriend in Memphis. But she was encouraged by her mother, Jo LaVern Alden, a serious Elvis fan, to hang in there with the King. Jo had taken her little girl to Graceland to peer through the big iron gates, she was such an Elvis fan. To motivate Ginger to accompany him on tour, Elvis even promised to pay for landscaping at her mother’s house as well as pay off her mortgage. That payout would be an issue the mother would take to court after Elvis’s death. And she would win. Death in the family: Elvis accompanies Ginger to her grandfather's funeral in in Arkansas in 1977 . Yes sir: Alden tells the chronological story of how she first met the King when she was five years old and her father was a Public Relations Officer in the army in Memphis. This is her dad with Elvis. While Ginger writes glowingly about being at his shows, Elvis often motivated her to travel with him by flying in her family as well. He proposed to Alden in his bathroom at Graceland on January 26 1977. ‘When January 26th came, I felt as I had known Elvis longer than a few months. Our relationship had been so intense as if he wanted me to know almost everything about him in a short time. 'I knew I had fallen in love and couldn't imagine not being with him. His cousin Billy had told me how Elvis would come in from riding motorcycles, fall across the bed and say, ‘there must be someone out there for me’. We had been together a short time but I felt I had found my soul mate’. Elvis presented the 11.5 carat diamond engagement ring worth $70,000 made from his TCB (Taking Care of Business) ring he wore on stage saying, ‘I never thought that I would find it in my own backyard, I’m asking you, will you marry me’? ‘I was so happy as he presented a green velvet box, opened it and placed a very large and beautiful diamond ring on my finger. My hand was shaking as we kissed and stepped out of the bathroom into the bedroom. My hand was still trembling as he kept lifting it to look at the ring saying, ‘oh boy’. Elvis proposed to Alden in his bathroom at Graceland on January 26, 1977.  He died in his bathroom on August 16 . Chill: Ginger said Elvis had a relaxing time on their Hawaiian vacation but it was cut short when he got sand in his eye and scratched his cornea. He wanted a doctor in Memphis to check it out . Describing their first sex, in her book she writes, ‘I felt chills as he touched me. Was this it? Were we finally going to make love? I was aroused but anxious, barely able to breathe’. In her memoir, Ginger reveals Elvis hit her once and apologized. He shot off firearms at a television set and a telephone, threw a dish of ice cream he was devouring when she decided to talk about calories and being fat. He always apologized for his passive aggressive behavior that he exhibited when he didn't get his way. But she tells her story with affection drawing a rosy aura over the scant details she’s willing to finally divulge. Ginger writes that Elvis was interested in numerology and conspiracy theories but according to the early review, Elvis comes off as a lightweight. Ginger was a witness in early March 1977 to the signing of Elvis’s Last Will and Testament but there was no mention of her in the document. Immediately after Elvis's will was signed, he went to Hawaii with an entourage of thirty including the Alden's sisters -- Rosemary and Terry. They all checked into the Rainbow Towers, Hilton Hawaiian Village Hotel but Elvis would move out with Ginger and into a rented beach house in Kailua, on the other side of the Island. He relaxed on the beach, played touch football, went shopping, watched television, played ping pong and ate cheeseburgers, pizza, barbecue dinners -- before promising he'd go on a diet when he got back to Memphis. 'My time with Elvis was so special and the Hawaiian vacation was a lot of fun', Ginger said. It was to be his last vacation, but it was cut short when he got sand in his eye and scratched his cornea. He wanted a doctor in Memphis to check it out. 'I stayed at Graceland and administered eye cream for a few days so I could help him be prepared for his next tour.' Fans branded Ginger as the woman who had not saved Elvis. Ginger stepped out of the public eye after the King’s death. She did the one interview in  2002 and declared this was the last time she was talking – until the idea for her memoir evolved twelve years later.

"The only people who could possibly have caught Nico Rosberg on Sunday were Interpol. He disappeared off our screens almost all afternoon only to emerge as the inevitable winner of the German Grand Prix. It was the perfect end to a fantastic fortnight for Rosberg who got married, watched Germany win the World Cup and signed a new £40million contract with Mercedes. As Rosberg lapped up Deutschlandlied, the German national anthem, plus the applause of his home crowd at Hockenheim, Lewis Hamilton looked slightly glum. He was perhaps a bit hard on himself, for he drove swashbucklingly well from 20th on the grid to finish third. Celebrate: Nico Rosberg sprays champagne after winning the German Grand Prix on Sunday . Happy: Rosberg accepts the admiration of the German fans as Lewis Hamilton rubs his eyes (right) Catch me if you can: Rosberg led the way after starting in pole position in Hockenheim . Well done: Rosberg embraces Dieter Zetsche (right) after winning the German Grand Prix in Hockenheim . VIDEO Rosberg uses local knowledge to triumph . He slipped a further 10 points behind Rosberg in the drivers’ standings, a mercifully small margin given that brake failure in qualifying left his legs, back and car badly bruised. The gap is now at 14. Asked if his glass was half full or half empty at the end of an entertaining race, he sighed: ‘Hmm. Well. I don’t know how to answer that. I came from the back to get on the podium — it’s quite an achievement so half full. ‘But I can’t be too ecstatic about it because it has been a tough weekend for me and I’ve ultimately lost more points to Nico in the championship battle.’ The title will probably be decided by the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi, where points ludicrously count double. The loser of that contest, joked Mercedes boss Toto Wolff, might need psychological help. Hamilton was all action here, going three abreast with Kimi Raikkonen’s Ferrari and Daniel  Ricciardo’s Red Bull. It was reminiscent of a move that imprinted itself on the conscience of the wider world in the GP2 race at Silverstone eight years ago . He was again brave and daring, his car emerging from the outside of the hairpin ahead. For the most part, his car was so much stronger than the rest that he simply scythed through the field. He briefly lay second while others pitted but was ultimately thwarted in his attempt to pip Williams’ Valtteri Bottas to runners-up spot. Hamilton . was not helped in this endeavour by clipping Jenson Button’s McLaren, . believing his old team-mate was letting him through. His front wing was damaged and he lost downforce, but he continued, waving in apology as he passed Button the following lap. Podium finishers: Rosberg won the race whilst Hamilton came from the back to finish third . Losing ground: Hamilton is now 10 points behind his Mercedes team-mate in the standings . ‘He has been such a gentleman this year and not given me too much trouble getting past but it was just a misunderstanding today,’ said Hamilton. ‘I wasn’t close enough to try and pass but I was on the inside line in the corner. It looked like he had gone wide, then he cut back across the corner and perhaps he didn’t see me there. 'I lost quite a bit of downforce with the damage and it made it very hard to look after the front left tyre. We converted from a two-stop strategy to three.’ However, Button was unimpressed by Hamilton’s driving. ‘Why would we let anyone through?’ he asked. ‘I don’t know if you’ve noticed but a lot of drivers do that line to get a good exit from the corner. The problem with Lewis is he expected me to let him past. I don’t think I’m the only person he drove into today. It’s strange. With his car being so much quicker you’d think he wouldn’t get into so many fights, but there you go. ‘He drove into my rear wheel. I’m out there doing my race. It would make it boring if we all let him past when he was coming through the field.’ Bottas was no more willing to yield than Button, stubbornly defending from Hamilton in the closing laps. The Finn — who has long been rated highly by his boss Sir Frank Williams — is proving a fine driver in a car that is the best of the rest after Mercedes. It was his third consecutive podium finish. He is outgunning his team-mate Felipe Massa, the little Brazilian who was again entangled in a spectacular crash. Trouble behind: Rosberg leads the way as Massa crashes at the first corner . Out: Felipe Massa crashed in the first curve of the German Formula One Grand Prix in Hockenheim . Rolling: The high-speed crash saw Massa's car flipped upside down . Relief: The Brazilian seemed to be OK after the heavy collision with Kevin Magnussen . Heat of the moment: Daniil Kyvat was forced out of the race as his car burst into flames . He was disputing the first corner with Kevin Magnussen when the two men collided. Massa was flipped over and skidded upside down along the asphalt for a  second or two. ‘It is normally a guy who comes from GP2 who causes this accident,’ said Massa, in a classic case of finger-pointing. ‘I was in front. I was doing the corner in front of him. If anyone needs to watch, it is the car behind.’ Magnussen argued: ‘If I’d had somewhere to go, then there wouldn’t have been contact with Felipe. I did my best to try to avoid the accident but there wasn’t much else I could do.’ The stewards investigated the incident but decided, not unreasonably, that it was a ‘racing incident’ undeserving of a punishment for either man. The race was threatened by rain throughout, but it was not until soon after the podium ceremony that it came. Still, we were hardly starved of fun. We got another three abreast joust, this time with the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso, Raikkonen and Ricciardo’s Red Bull, and then a nip-and-tuck fight between Alonso and Ricciardo. We held our breath when Adrian Sutil’s Sauber was left in the  middle of the track. Surely the safety car would come out. But, no, it stayed there until marshals finally scampered on and pushed it away. It was hairy. Lap 1: Three places gained on the opening lap . Lap 3: Passes Max Chilton, Pastor Maldonado and Esteban Gutierrez to move up to 14th . Lap 4: Nails Romain Grosjean to go 13th . Lap 7: It’s Adrian Sutil next . Lap 13: Makes contact with Kimi Raikkonen before barging his way past the Finn, then passes Ricciardo on the same lap. A flurry of pit-stops means he is now 7th . Lap 14: Starting on the harder tyre has paid dividends. He is 5th after passing Sergio Perez . Lap 27: Pits for first time; re-joins in 8th . Lap 30: Damages his front wing after banging wheels with Jenson Button . Lap 31: The damage isn’t terminal though, and he passes his former McLaren team-mate . Lap 44: Pits and re-joins in 5th .

"Allan Austin, 57, has a hernia the size of a football which makes it hard for him to walk and causes 'awful' pain . A man with a hernia the size of a football says he was accidentally wiped from the surgery waiting list - and has now been told there's no funding to treat him. Allan Austin, 57, has seen the 30cm by 30cm hernia continue to grow during his eight-month ‘nightmare’ and says he can barely walk. Mr Austin, from Maidenhead, says he is in ‘awful’ pain - and the delay in his treatment has meant the hernia is now too big for standard hernia surgery to be appropriate. As a result, he needs a £12,000 more complex operation, but has been told funding is not available as the surgery is ‘not essential’. Mr Austin said: ‘It’s been a nightmare. They can’t leave me like this, it’s just too painful. ‘It’s awful. In the morning I can sort of walk about but as the day progresses it gets heavier and by the end I can hardly walk. ‘The hernia was painful to start with but I could get about. Now it is five times bigger and really heavy. ‘If I drop something on the floor I can't get down to pick it up and I’m in constant pain. ‘The stabbing pain stops me in my tracks and it’s so sore. After 4.30pm every day I spend the rest of the day sitting down because of it.’ Mr Austin, who works for an engineering firm, was first admitted to Wexham Park Hospital, near Slough, with a burst abscess in his bowel in April 2013. He credits staff for saving his life during an operation to fit a colostomy bag, but he developed a small hernia as a result. Surgery to correct it was postponed in November as doctors weren’t happy with the results of an ECG – a test used to detect heart problems. Then in January, the hospital revealed Mr Austin had accidentally been removed from the waiting list altogether. By now, the hernia had got worse, ballooning from around three to four inches to the size of a football. And rather than standard hernia treatment, he needs a four to five hour operation to fit a mesh to hold the hernia back. He said the doctors appealed to the local clinical commissioning group for a grant to cover the £12,000 cost but were only offered £5,000, leaving a £7,000 shortfall. Wexham Park Hospital accidentally wiped Mr Austin from its hernia surgery waiting list. The hernia is now so big he has been told standard hernia surgery will not be sufficient and he needs a £12,000 operation for which no funding is currently available as it is deemed 'non-essential' Mr Austin has hit out at the administration errors that have caused him to fall through the cracks. He is particularly concerned as untreated hernias can cause dangerous complications such as a bowel obstruction or interruption to the herniated tissue's blood supply. In a letter to MP Theresa May, he said: ‘The sheer negligence and incompetence shown to me in the last eight months is quite unbelievable. ‘No one seems to care anymore. Not once have I been asked about this whole situation and how I feel about it.’ The hospital trust has apologised for the delay and launched an investigation. A statement from the hospital said: ‘Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust would like to apologise to Mr Austin for the delay in his treatment. ‘The trust is conducting a thorough investigation into all aspects of Mr Austin’s care and is in contact with him to ensure he is aware of the outcomes of this investigation.’","Allan Austin had surgery after suffering a burst abscess in his bowel in 2013 .

"Hollywood actress Brittany Murphy would still be alive today if her mother had called for an ambulance 24 hours before she collapsed, a leading pathologist claimed yesterday. Tragically Murphy was so frightened of the paparazzi outside her home she had turned into a social recluse and was reluctant to receive medical help when she first started having trouble breathing. Miss Murphy was also very sedated due to the drugs she was taking and so may not have appeared as ill as she was. As a result Miss Murphy’s mother Sharon only called 911 after her daughter sank into her arms, lifeless, on the morning of December 20, 2009. Scroll down for video . Murphy pictured in 2006 in Sydney at the premiere for the movie Happy Feet. She died three years later . Tomorrow night a new documentary will examine the final hours of the 32-year-old actress, who soared to fame after appearing in the hit 1995 comedy Clueless before starring in films including 8 Mile and Sin City. Officially, the coroner attributed her death to pneumonia and anaemia - the same ailments that would kill her husband, British filmmaker Simon Monjack, 40, five months later. Rumours also circulated at the time that Miss Murphy was a cocaine addict and had an eating disorder. Now pathologist Dr Richard Shepherd, who was involved in examining the deaths of Princess Diana and murdered Crimewatch host Jill Dando, has claimed Miss Murphy’s life could have been saved if she had been seen by doctors 24 hours earlier. Dr Shepherd said: ‘By the time Brittany collapsed in her bathroom there was probably nothing the paramedics or hospital staff could have done to save her. But had she been taken to hospital 24 hours earlier and given intravenous drugs, there is a very good chance she would have survived and would still be here today.’ The pathologist doesn’t say it was deliberate, nor does he directly blame the mother. But it is the mother who called the ambulance in the end. Dr Shepherd does not blame Sharon for her daughter’s death and in the documentary explains they may not have realised how ill she was as she was addicted to prescription drugs and was in a sedated state. Brittany Murphy, right, rose to fame for her role alongside Alicia Silverstone and Stacey Dash in the movie Clueless . He said: ‘Brittany was so sedated it’s quite possible neither Simon nor Sharon had any idea how ill she actually was. That may be the reason why they didn’t call an ambulance.’ In the days and weeks leading up to Miss Murphy’s death she had been taking a ‘cocktail’ of prescription medication, Dr Shepherd said, including anti-depressants, sedatives and anti-anxiety drugs. She was also taking cough medicine to help ease the symptoms of her chest infection. According to the pathologist the combination of drugs in Miss Murphy’s system might have contributed to her death. Dr Shepherd said: ‘Drugs can have a very beneficial effect but they also have side effects. And mixing them together means that these side effects can combine and become lethal.’ He added: ‘Cough medication is designed to stop you coughing so that you feel better. But actually it also stops you bringing up the mucus and the bacteria out of your lungs. So it tends to make pneumonias worse. Brittany was perhaps coughing but she wasn’t coughing enough or fiercely enough to clear the mucus in her lungs.’ Theories about Miss Murphy’s death have ranged from anorexia to cocaine and even suspicion she was poisoned – none of which Dr Shepherd’s analysis of her autopsy report found to be true. Traces of Methamphetamine, for example, came from an inhaler not illegal drug usage. But he said there is evidence the poor condition of her home – described by her mother-in-law Linda Monjack as ‘a place of unhealthiness’ – exacerbated her condition. At the time, Miss Murphy’s mother asked the pathologist to investigate whether fungi in the mould growing on her walls and poorly ventilated rooms could have contributed to her death. Images have been released showing the vast CCTV camera network which Murphy had installed in her home . Murphy and her husband became reclusive, installing CCTV cameras and fingerprint-recognition locking systems . Living in poor housing conditions would likely have had an effect on her health, the pathologist said . Dr Shepherd said: ‘The autopsy report shows they didn’t find any fungi, either in her blood stream or in the sections of lung that they examined under the microscope. So mould and fungi haven’t played a direct role in the death of Brittany. ‘But living in poor housing conditions like that is likely to have had a debilitating effect and contributed to her infection and death.’ He added: ‘She was apparently living in appalling conditions.’ Autopsy: The Final Hours of Brittany Murphy, which is on Channel 5 on Thursday at 9pm, will also expose the extent of Miss Murphy’s paranoid fear she was being watched. As well as being fearful of the paparazzi, she and Mr Monjack, believed they were being targeted by the American Government, after Miss Murphy gave evidence in a whistle blowing trial involving a friend. Murphy pictured acting alongside rapper Eminem in the critically acclaimed 2003 film 8 Mile . The couple, who were married in 2007, became reclusive within their home, where they installed ‘Fort Knox’ style security, including a fingerprint-recognition locking system, CCTV cameras. And they hired a guard to patrol the property 24-hours a day. Describing their set up as ‘completely raving mad’, Mrs Monjack said: ‘They would say there were helicopters flying over-head, they were being watched, both of them were very fearful of this. The house was like Fort Knox. They had surveillance cameras all around the house. And they had a security guard there 24 hours. The security was mad. Totally completely raving mad. It was way over the top. And it was because they were frightened.’ She added: ‘They were very reclusive.’","Coroner blamed pneumonia and anaemia for her death in December 2009 .

"Coffee and red wine are known offenders when it comes to staining teeth. But did you know there are foods that can actually help whiten them? Beverly Hills dentist Dr Harold Katz says dark chocolate, green tea and strawberries can all help. And to get the best results, they should eaten first thing in the morning after plaque has built up on the teeth during the night. Here, Dr Katz’s shares his top tips for naturally white teeth with MailOnline... Eating dark chocolate, strawberries and cheese can help whiten the teeth, a leading dentist says . Dark chocolate . This contains theobromine, a bitter powder which helps harden the enamel surface of teeth. This in turn helps to prevent staining, as a weak outer coating on the teeth makes them more susceptible to discolouration. Sadly for milk chocolate lovers, the effect does not apply with this type of chocolate. In fact, Dr Katz says milk chocolate can cause bad breath because it contains sugar and milk. Green tea . Green tea contains tannins which prevent staining because they stop bacteria sticking to the teeth. This means it can also prevent bad breath. The drink also contains chemicals called polyphenols which fight oral acids and bacteria. Drinking it also boosts fluoride levels in the mouth which may lead to less erosion of the teeth’s enamel. Dark chocolate contains theobromine which helps harden the enamel surface of teeth. Green tea contains tannins which prevent staining by stopping bacteria sticking to the teeth - it also combats bad breath . Strawberries . These contain malic acid, an enzyme that actually cleans stains off the teeth - and mashed strawberries can be mixed with baking soda to create a natural whitening product. However, Dr Katz warns that other berries do not have the same effect – in fact, he says some actually stain teeth. Cheese . A little-known benefit of cheese is that it increases the pH level in the mouth making it less acidic. This means the chance of discolouration and tooth erosion is reduced. The calcium in cheese can also contribute to stronger, healthier teeth. Cheese reduces the pH of the mouth making it less acidic - this means it reduces the risk of tooth erosion . Nuts, seeds, apples and pears . Crunchy and abrasive foods - such as seeds, nuts, apples and pears – help to scrub plaque and stain-causing substances from the teeth. The crispy texture of apples can also toughen the gums reducing the risk of gum disease and tooth loss. And, the high water content in apples and pears increases saliva production – saliva is essential for reducing bacteria. Dr Katz has a new range products that help to whiten and banish bad breath. The Breath Co line will launch in Boots on June 25.","Dr Harold Katz says dark chocolate helps harden the enamel surface of teeth .

"People consume 200 extra calories a day when eating at a restaurant compared to dining at home, a new study has revealed. Researchers have found that adults who eat out take in more calories, sugar, saturated fat and salt than when they stay in to eat, whether they are at a fast food outlet or a formal restaurant with full table service. The study published online by the journal Public Health Nutrition, backs up previous research linking eating out to people consuming more calories. People can consume an extra 200 calories a day if they eat out at a restaurant, new research has revealed . This includes data which shows adults, who reported eating fast food, consumed more calories, fat and salt as well as less fruit, vegetables and vitamins compared to those who don't eat it. The research was conducted by Binh Nguyen of the American Cancer Society and Lisa Powell of Chicago University. They used data from more than 12,000 people aged 20 to 64, who were asked about visits to fast food and table service restaurants on two successive days. The study found that on days when eating at a fast-food restaurant, there was a net increase of total energy intake by 194.49 calories, saturated fat by 3.48 grams, sugar by 3.95 grams and salt by 296.38mgs. Researchers found that eating at fast food restaurants caused people to consume on around 194 calories a day more than if they ate at home . Eating at a table-service restaurant was also associated with a higher energy intake with diners consuming an extra 205.21 calories, and with higher intake of saturated fat by 2.52 grams and salt by 451.06mgs. The study also found individual characteristics moderated the impact of restaurant food consumption. Net energy intake was larger for black adults compared with their white and Hispanic counterparts and greater for middle-income compared to high-income adults. Doctor Nguyen said: 'Our study confirms that adults’ fast-food and full-service restaurant consumption was associated with higher daily total energy intake and poorer dietary indicators.' The researchers say the larger adverse effect they measured on energy intake for some lower socio-economic and minority populations has policy implications. They say efforts to improve diet and reduce energy intake from restaurant sources could actually help to reduce racial and socio-economic disparities in diets.","We also eat more sugar, saturated fat and salt when dining out .

"In many ways, Rafaella Kopelan is like any other six-year-old girl - she enjoys playing on swings, riding her bike and . playing with the family's dog. But every activity has to be done with extreme care - because her skin could tear at any moment. Rafaella suffers from the rare condition epidermolysis bullosa - a genetic disorder which can prove fatal. The incurable condition means her skin blisters constantly - and has caused her fingers to fuse together. Rafaella Kopelan, six, was born with a rare and incurable genetic condition - called epidermolysis bullosa - which means her skin blisters and tears at the slightest touch . It takes more than 90 minutes to prepare her for the day - starting at 5.15am, all of her bandages have to be changed. Her parents must also bath her and apply a special cream, as well as cleaning and dressing her wounds which are prone to infection. The condition has also caused her fingers to become fused together. But Rafi, who lives in Manhattan, New York, refuses to let her condition slow her down and has even helped raise an incredible $600,000 (£358,000) for charity. Her father, Brett, Executive Director of the charity Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa Research Association (DebRA), had never heard of the disease before she was born. He said: ‘When Rafi was born she was missing skin on the back of one hand and on both feet. The hospital didn't know what was wrong and after six hours she began to blister. ‘The next morning when I saw her the world fell out from beneath my feet. ‘Doctors started to rule things out and then about nine days later tested for EB. ‘I called my brother who is a physician . and tried to pronounce the name and he said “oh no” - at that point I . knew our lives were going to change forever.’ Rafi's parents, Brett and Jackie, have to smother her in special cream and spend hours caring for her wounds . The condition has also caused Rafi's fingers to fuse together and it leaves her in agonising pain . Rafi’s mother, Jackie, had to stop working and her father worked from home for the first three years of her life. For two years they rented an apartment in Minneapolis, Minnesota, so Rafi could undergo an experimental stem cell transplant which only seven children had undergone before. Mr Kopelan said: ‘She had a severe case of EB and there was nothing else at that time. ‘Jackie and I knew Rafi might not survive the procedure but we had many factors in our favour. Epidermolysis . bullosa is a term used to describe a group of rare, inherited skin . disorders that cause the skin to become very fragile. In people with EB, even the gentlest touch can cause painful blisters. Symptoms . include blisters inside the mouth, thickened skin and nails, fingers . and toes becoming joined together, blistering in the oesophagus, chewing . and swallowing problems, vision problems and skin cancer. Symptoms are usually present from birth. EB occurs because of faulty genes inherited from one or both parents and affects about one in every 17,000 children in the UK. There is currently no cure - treatment aims to relieve symptoms. The outlook depends a lot on the severity and type of EB a child has. Source: NHS Choices . ‘She was young, the disease hadn't progressed to a certain point and we were able to use the cord blood from a German girl who was a good match for her.’ Despite the extremely high risks involved, the transplant allowed Rafi's body to begin producing the protein, Collagen 7, which it could not before. This protein production meant her condition is slightly less severe, but she still has a bad case of EB. Doctors are unsure whether her body will ever produce enough of the protein in the future.

There is currently no cure - treatment aims to relieve symptoms. The outlook depends a lot on the severity and type of EB a child has. Mr Kopelan . said: ‘EB is like the feeling when you fall off a bike or scrape your . leg and then get into a shower - how much it hurts when the water and . soap hit it. ‘If you imagine most of your body as an open wound - we have to hurt our daughter in order to keep her clean and safe. Rafi underwent pioneering stem cell treatment which improved her condition slightly but it is still severe . ‘Every time you approach a child with EB you have to stop and think because everything that is innate about handling a child is now different. ‘You can't lift a child with EB from under the arms to give them a hug as that might rip skin. ‘Truth is, you just can't be rough with a child with EB. You can't run at them and grab them and swing them in the air like you would a healthy child. ‘I think that is where the idea of you can't hug a child with EB came from. Does that make me sad? Yes it does. ‘It makes me sad she can't zoom down a slide for fear that she loses skin on her bottom and then hurts her feet when she hits the ground. Rafi's father, Brett Kopelan, said: 'EB is like the feeling when you fall off a bike or scrape your leg and then get into a shower - how much it hurts when the water and soap hit it' ‘It makes me sad when my parents go to pick her up and they don't always think not to lift her up the way they do their other grandchildren. ‘Rafi can't do the things or experience some things that other children can and that makes me very sad. It's impossible to know what she goes through. ‘Whenever you physically interact with Rafi, or any child with EB for that matter, it is better to breathe first, think second and then act accordingly.’ In 2012, the family set up 'Rafi's Run' - an annual 5km fun run in New York which raises money for research into a cure. She attends a local school in Manhattan and her father said she is very mature about the disease. Mr Kopelan said: 'There is no one I admire more in this world than my daughter' Her father added: ‘There was a time when Rafi said having EB made her unique, which was an incredibly mature thought pattern for a five-year-old. ‘I couldn't be more proud - but, the truth is she hates having EB and I can't blame her. ‘I keep telling her about the different medicines being developed to help her and she is excited about the possibility of beating her EB. ‘It's not fair she has to go through everything that she does, but she handles it with a grace and courage that I know I couldn't muster. ‘There is no one I admire more in this world than my daughter.’ For more information on the condition visit the Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa Research Association website.","Rafaella Kopelan has the incurable skin condition epidermolysis bullosa .

"Richard Dart pictured after he had converted to Islam . A filmmaker attempts to understand his stepbrother's journey from middle-class white boy to convicted terrorist in a new documentary. In 2010 Robb Leech spent a year filming his stepbrother Richard Dart after he turned his back on the world he grew up in to become a fundamentalist Muslim called Salahuddin. The pair grew up together after Robb's father married Richard's mother. At the weekends they would play with the family dog in their garden in Weymouth, Dorset, and enjoyed swimming and playing football. Family holidays were often spent camping in France. In his mid-teens Richard moved to the Isle of Wight to live with his father and the boys saw less of each other. By his early twenties, Richard went to the U.S. to work with children in a summer camp. However, when he came back Richard told people he had found religion and was now a Christian. By the following year, things had changed dramatically in Richard's life. He had converted to Islam and changed his name to Salahuddin al-Britani. Robb went to meet his stepbrother in Mile End, east London, and was shocked to discover Richard wearing robes and sporting a long beard. Robb told the Sunday Mirror: 'I was shocked. I tried to connect with him but he preached for five hours. I went away thinking he'd been brainwashed.' To make some sense of it all, Robb began filming with his stepbrother. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

"Luis Suarez is currently Public Enemy No 1 as the villain of the hour at this World Cup but where does he really rank in the all-time Rogues Gallery? In most lists of men and women who have blackened their sports by cheating on the field of play or horrendous misconduct off it, the names of Lance Armstrong, Ben Johnson and Diego Maradona are invariably the big three. By such populist judgement Uruguay’s chomper at bits of his opponents would not make the top 20 in historical context. Not in the long term rather than in this very immediate heat of the moment. Ain't that the tooth: Suarez reacts after biting Chiellini (seated) at the World Cup clash in Natal . It is when absolute moral criteria are applied in the proper order that Suarez not only nibbles his way into the reckoning of shame but gnaws his way above the syringing cyclist, the steroid sprinter and the snorting goal-scorer. There are four degrees of scandal  – drug abuse, match-fixing, plain cheating and the deliberate inflicting of grievous bodily harm. In my estimation the latter is by far the most serious and the big six in this list reflect their gravity in this culpability. Below them the places of shame are shuffled among the other classes of offenders, taking into account not only the extent of the negative impact on their sports but, even more importantly, how they shattered our dreams. These ratings also reflect an element of British interest since the nearer it hits to home, the closer to the bone. 20) FRED LORZ . To start,, one to give us a much chuckle. In 90-degree heat at the 1904 St Louis Olympics, which reduced the 32-man field to 14 finishers, this New Yorker covered a mountainous marathon course in just three hours and 13 minutes. Alice Roosevelt, daughter of the president, was about to present him with the gold when it was discovered he had ridden 11 miles as a passenger in his manager’s car. Comical: Fred Lorz made history at the 1904 Summer Olympics when he quit running the marathon and decided to grab a lift in his manager's car instead - it broke down and he walked the remaining six miles... many thought he won . 19) STEPHEN LEE . Snooker’s carefully cultivated image transformation from dingy, smoke-filled gambling halls to gleaming TV arenas took a hit when, in 2012, Lee was hit with a 12-year ban for match-fixing. Shamed: Snooker player Stephen Lee was handed a 12-year ban in 2012 after being found guilty of match fixing . 18) TOM WILLIAMS . Rugby preens itself as a game for thugs played by gentlemen. Not after Bloodgate. Cheating with blood replacements was exposed when Harlequins winger Williams (bit on a capsule to fake a mouth injury in a Heineken Cup tie against Leinster. Bloodgate: The world of rugby was shocked after Harlequins' Tom Williams bit a capsule to fake a mouth injury . 17) TIGER WOODS . What happened in Las Vegas didn’t stay in Las Vegas. The role-model image of the greatest golfer in the world fell between the gambling tables and the ladies of the Strip. He admits he has never been the same since. Nor has the game that made him so famous. Villain: Golf star Tiger Woods publicly admitted to cheating on his wife Elin Nordegren in 2010 . Suffering: The all-conquering American maintains that he has never been the same since the scandal . 16) MICHAEL ATHERTON . When England cricket captain Atherton was fined £2,000 for  having dirt in his pocket at the home of the game during a Test match against South Africa, it shook Lord’s to its foundations. Shook to its core: England cricket captain Mike Atherton kept dirt in his pocket to tamper with the ball during a Test match against South Africa in 1994 at Lords... he was fined £2000 . 15) MICHELLE SMITH de BRUYN . Irish eyes were smiling when, at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, their darling swimmer won their first three Olympic gold medals ever — then crying when she was banned for four years after tampering with her urine sample. That deepened suspicions about the influence of husband and coach Erik de Bruin, a Dutch discus thrower previously suspended for steroid abuse. Stripped: Michelle Smith de Bruin won three Olympic gold medals for Ireland in 1996, only to be banned for four years after tampering with her urine sample... her husband and coach was previously suspended for steroid abuse . 14) ALEX RODRIGUEZ . Most expensive baseball player ever when bought by the New York Yankees, but became the poster-boy for steroid-abusing  sluggers. A-Rod has been fingered, also, for betraying his team-mates by tipping off opposing hitters as to what pitches to expect. 'Poster boy': Alex Rodriguez of the New York Yankees admitted taking performance-enhancing drugs . 13) BORIS ONISCHENKO . Ukrainian pentathlete went home in disgrace from the 1976 Montreal Olympics after being outed by British rivals Adrian Parker and Jim Fox for the most bizarre of all these offences — electronically wiring his sword to score hits in the fencing discipline even when it failed to make contact. Bizarre: USSR's Boris Onischenko was sent hom from the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games after he electronically wired his fencing sword to score hits in the pentathlon... here his epee is checked by an official . 12) SHOELESS JOE JACKSON . The all-time great baseball player was accused of involvement in the worst controversy to blight America’s Game, when the Chicago White Sox sold the 1919 World Series to Cincinnati Reds for a bribe of $5,000 a man — known as the Black Sox scandal. One sobbing boy famously put into words the sentiment of millions of heartbroken young fans when he begged Jackson outside the court: ‘Say it ain’t so, Joe.’ Say it ain't so, Joe: Chicago White Sox's Shoeless Joe Jackson was accused of his involvement in throwing the 1919 World Series to the Cincinnati Reds after receiving a $5,000 bribe . 11) DIEGO MARADONA . Usually cited for his Hand of God goal against England but listed here not for this form of cheating which, sadly, is common-place in football, but for being expelled from the USA World Cup of 1994 for the ephedrine doping which set a terrible example for his millions of young worshippers. Two counts: Diego Maradona scored this 'goal', dubbed the Hand of God against England at the 1986 World Cup . Scandal: Maradona scored in the 1994 tournament for Argentina... but was then expelled after failing a drugs test . 10) MARION JONES . The most infamous cheat in women’s athletics, Jones was forced into admitting the use of performance-enhancing drugs at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 and was stripped of her five medals. At her peak: Marion Jones was a women's sprinting icon after winning the 100m at 2000 Sydney Olympics . Tearful: But she was forced to admit taking performance-enhancing drugs and was stripped of her medals . 9) BEN JOHNSON . Shocked the world by winning the 100 metres at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul by the length of a street. Then he shocked the world again by testing positive for steroids and being stripped of his gold. Comfortable: Ben Johnson easily won the 100m in 1988 in Seoul, he later tested positive for steroids . 8) HANSIE CRONJE . Of all people to open the worm-can of cricket match-fixing, South Africa’s puritanically religious captain was the most unlikely. Yet in 2000 he was found guilty of collaborating with Asian bookmakers during a tour of India. He died in a light plane crash three years later, still banned, still in denial. Captain shock: South Africa's Hansie Cronje was found guilty of match-fixing in 2000, he died three years later . 7) LANCE ARMSTRONG . After years of denials, the cyclist finally confessed that those record-breaking Tour de France triumphs were fuelled by steroids. Also betrayed the millions of devoted fans who admired him for the phenomenal willpower that had raised him from a cancer deathbed. Record breaker: But Lance Armstrong admitted all those Tour de France titles were fuelled by steroids . The truth: Armstrong sat down with masseuse Emma O'Reilly and Sportsmail's Matt Lawton for an exclusive interview last year . 6) LUIS SUAREZ . Football’s serial biter whose latest sinking of the fangs was into Italy’s Giorgio Chiellini in Brazil. More than enough said. New entry: Luis Suarez is a definite on this list after he bit Giorgio Chiellini in the World Cup match last month . Painful? Suarez was banned for four months and nine international games... he has only just apologised . 5) ANTONIO MARGARITO . Had plaster of Paris taped onto his knuckles for a world-title fight in 2009, turning his fists into sledgehammer-like weapons. He could have killed Sugar Shane Mosley and his ban took into account suspicions that it had happened before. Sledgehower like weapons: Antonio Margarito (right) had plaster of Paris taped round his knuckles during his fight against Shane Mosley in 2009 . 4) HARALD SCHUMACHER . The worst of all football’s  assaults saw Germany’s keeper hurtle out of his area in the 1982 World Cup semi-final in Seville and fling his body at Patrick Battiston as the Frenchman was through on goal. Battiston was feared dead but responded to oxygen and was taken to hospital in a coma, with shattered vertebrae and broken teeth. Sickening: Harald Schumacher ploughed into Patrick Battiston during the World Cup semi-final in 1982 . Sorry sight: The French defender was feared dead... no foul or card was given to the West Germany keeper . 3) MIKE TYSON . In sport’s most outrageous  biting incident, 17 years ago last weekend Iron Mike chewed off Evander Holyfield’s ear in a world heavyweight title fight in Las Vegas — confirming his deliberately  cultivated image as The Baddest Man on the Planet. Take that Luis Suarez: Mike Tyson bit a chunk off Evander Holyfield's ear during a World Heavyweight title fight . 2) TONYA HARDING . Such are the pressures on adolescent ice maidens that this sweet little missy from Portland, Oregon grew up so desperate to win the 1994 US figure skating championships and thereby qualify for that year’s Winter Olympics that she and her ex-husband commissioned an iron-bar knee-capping of her main rival Nancy Kerrigan.

"She's famous for her poise but even Queen Letizia, 42, couldn't help taking a step back when confronted with an angry-looking bull during a visit to a farm show. And the enormous beast wasn't the only one to leave her with ruffled feathers. An Andalusian horse that shied while being gingerly petted by the royal also had her reeling back to safety. By contrast, husband King Felipe, 46, appeared to take a shine to the horse although even he looked a little on the nervous side while holding the bull's lead rope. Taking a step back: Letizia takes cover behind husband King Felipe as they get close to a bull during a fair . Not a fan: Letizia jerks back in alarm after the Andalusian horse she was petting shied and tossed its head . Happily, the 6ft 5"" monarch soon had beasts of a smaller size to contend with and was spotted towering over a flock of sheep while enjoying a chat with their owner. Letizia, meanwhile, went outside to meet the crowds waiting outside the venue in Zafra, a town in Spain's southern Extremadura region, where she was soon busy with selfies. She also had a close encounter of an altogether more amenable kind, when she plucked a young well-wisher out of her mother's arms for a cuddle - much to the family's delight. The trip to the International Cattle Fair in Zafra was a far cry from yesterday's business, which saw the Spanish royal couple welcome President Juan Orlando Hernández of the Honduras and his wife to Spain. Honduras' presidential couple were welcomed at the Zarzuela Palace in Madrid as they began a state visit to Spain with a formal reception. Gingerly does it:  Letizia gives the horse a nervous pat... but Felipe appears to be enjoying himself . Enormous: Even 6ft 5"" King Felipe looked a little nervous during his close encounter with the huge bull . Much less frightening: King Felipe looked animated as he got involved in a discussion about sheep .

King Felipe, meanwhile, was dapper in a navy suit with a pink tie that matched his wife's ensemble - a trick he repeated in Zafra with a suit that came in an identical shade of grey to Letizia's.

Earlier this week, the couple enjoyed a rapturous reception as they arrived at the Castilla-La Mancha University in Toledo ahead of a reception with academics. It isn't the first time the couple have spent time with academics in recent weeks, with a visit to meet Spanish intellectuals working in New York included in their American trip at the end of last month. The visit, which saw Letizia reunited with her old friend Queen Maxima of the Netherlands, saw King Felipe make a speech at the UN in which he called for Spain to be given a temporary seat on the UN Security Council.

"The images of Germany celebrating their fourth World Cup triumph in the Maracana Stadium on Sunday evening will live long in the memory. Sadly, so too will the pictures of Joe Hart and Jack Wilshere tearing it up in Las Vegas after England’s latest tournament humiliation. Naturally these alarming pictures are amplified by the joyous scenes in Rio de Janeiro. Those German boys are entitled to celebrate.

AUGUST 2010Involved in a fracas outside a London nightclub, which left a woman with a broken arm. Wilshere was arrested and bailed but faced no charges. He received a caution for common assault, though a spokesman insisted he acted as peacemaker. MARCH 2011Wilshere received a police warning for trying to spit on a cab driver wearing a Spurs hat. The midfielder, who was drunk, later apologised. JULY 2012Wilshere was warned by UEFA after tweeting about betting during an Arsenal Champions League game. UEFA regulations state players cannot bet on games involving their own teams. INJURY LIST . JULY 2011 Limped out of a pre-season friendly with a stress fracture on his right ankle. FEBRUARY 2012 Suffered a second stress fracture to the heel of same foot. MAY 2012 Knee injury slowed his rehabilitation and eventually he required surgery, which kept him out for four more months. MARCH 2013 Inflamed left ankle saw him miss a Champions League game and two World Cup qualifiers. MAY 2013 Had surgery to remove a pin in his right ankle and missed two England’s friendlies.

Head and shoulders: The England goalkeeper in the pool at the MGM Grand . Grimacing: Jack pulls a face in the bubbling pool in front of two bikini-clad women . Top-class athletes cannot sustain these lifestyles and they should not seek them out either. It . was only a year ago that England’s captain Steven Gerrard claimed . Wilshere was a ‘world-class talent’ and even went on to say that the . Arsenal midfielder could succeed him as skipper. With . a ball at his feet, no-one doubts that Wilshere is a gifted individual, . but boozing it up in bars and smoking like a trooper is no way to . fulfil that talent. Last . October, Wilshere, who earns around £50,000 a week, assured Arsene . Wenger, his manager at Arsenal, that it was a ‘one off’ when he was . pictured smoking on a night out in London. ‘I . made a mistake. Players make mistakes. I’m not a smoker,’ he told . Arsenal’s official website. ‘I spoke to the boss and he asked me what . happened. I explained it to him and we sorted it out. He put me in the . team and hopefully I repaid him.’ Don’t . forget, in the hours that  followed Arsenal’s FA Cup victory, he was . caught on camera responding to supporters singing ‘What do we think of . Tottenham’ by shouting ‘****!’. Caught: Jack was photographed smoking a cigarette outside Dstrkt nightclub in October last year . No biggie, but Wilshere needs to straighten himself out if he is to go on to have a first-class playing career. He is 22 now. When . Arsenal play their opening  fixture against Crystal Palace in the . Barclays Premier League on August 16, Wilshere will be fighting for his . place — and it is getting congested in there. Mesut . Ozil, a World Cup winner now, new signing Alexis Sanchez, Aaron Ramsey, . Mikel Arteta, Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain are all battling . it out. Wilshere has a big  season ahead and this gem of a player is no . longer guaranteed a start in a mediocre England squad. He . is not alone. It was only a couple of weeks ago that Sunderland . striker  Connor Wickham was pictured with his pals in Puerta Banus, . Marbella, with the receipt for a £17,500, 15-litre bottle of Armand de . Brignac champagne. Anger: His Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was furious with the England midfielder for smoking in October . If he . wanted it badly enough, Wickham — who has represented England at Under . 16, 17, 19 and 21 levels — would be a full international. He has the . talent, but not the aptitude. At this rate, there is not a chance that . he will be considered for the England squad. Back . to Hart. At the Lions and Roses charity dinner on May 18, England’s . head coach Roy Hodgson allowed his players to have a couple of drinks. On . one table, Gerrard and Lampard had half a glass of red wine poured for . them and did not touch a drop. On another, far more  boisterous table, . Hart drank bottle after bottle of beer at a remarkable rate. Sitting . on the same table was Luke Shaw, a young man who cannot even drive yet, . at his first official England function. At the time he was 18. What . an  example to set a kid, . Trouble brewing? Jack assured Arsene Wenger (left) his last smoking episode was a 'one off' Disappointing: Jack had a frustrating World Cup as England crashed out in the group stage . Hart’s . boozing was Shaw’s introduction to what it means to be part of an . England squad preparing for the World Cup. It felt, and looked,  like . the keeper’s last big blow-out before the tournament. The next day England’s first-choice goalkeeper trained with the rest of his team-mates. Some preparation that is. Can . you imagine Manuel Neuer slugging back a few beers before the World Cup . in the same way with the Germany national team? Not on your life. Neuer . and his team-mates have  committed their lives to being the best they . can be. And they have made the necessary sacrifices to achieve their . ambitions on the field. As ever with England, they are  pouring it all away.","Arsenal star apologised for smoking near a London nightclub in October .

"Going public: Joanna Shields will create an international hub for technology in London . A senior executive from Facebook is joining the public payroll – and will be paid almost as much as the Prime Minister to try to turn London into a rival to Silicon Valley. The appointment of Joanna Shields comes at a time when the social networking site has come under fire for paying hardly any tax despite its huge profits. She will earn £115,000 a year in her new role as chief executive of the Tech City Investment Organisation, plus a £25,000 performance-related bonus, meaning her total pay is just short of David Cameron’s £142,500 salary. Miss Shields, 50, Facebook’s vice president and managing director in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, defended the company against allegations of tax avoidance. Last year it paid tax of only £200,000 on estimated UK revenues of £175million. ‘What’s missing from the story is why people do it,’ she said. ‘The reason those companies make those decisions is because of the investment environment and the tax environment.’ Miss Shields takes up her post in January. It was set up by the Government body UK Trade and Investment to encourage investment in a technology hub around Shoreditch in East London known as Tech City . Around 3,000 digital companies already operate in the area. Miss Shields said London was the . perfect international hub for digital innovation and should not be the . ‘stepchild’ of Silicon Valley in California and Bangalore in India. Miss Shields (pictured left at a press conference) will leave her position at Facebook. She received critical emails after the revelations of the company's tax affairs . 'Delighted': David Cameron is pleased Joanna is joining the Tech City Investment Organisation . Her role is to help secure investment for start-up companies and to lessen the red tape associated with starting a business. It also involves working as a business ambassador promoting the UK around the world. Meanwhile, two more foreign companies were yesterday accused of paying minimal tax in Britain despite big sales. The American internet auction giant . eBay paid only £1million of corporation tax on sales of £789million and . estimated profits of £181million in the UK during 2010 after channelling . cash through foreign companies to slash its bill legally from . £51million.

"They spent months together inside their mother's womb. But twins Axel and Alfie Perkins do not share a birthday - because they were born five days apart. The boys, who will soon celebrate their second birthday, were born at just 24 weeks after their mother Emma Day went into premature labour. But after giving birth to Axel - and expecting Alfie any minute - Miss Day's cervix inexplicably closed. Alfie (left) and Axel (right) Perkins are twins but they were born five days apart. Axel was born on July 19, 2012 and Alfie followed on July 24. Axel was born when their mother was just 24 weeks pregnant . She said: ‘A doctor gave me an inspection and was amazed. Axel’s placenta and Alfie were still stuck inside. ‘I . had to wait five more days before I went into labour again. I went down . to be by Axel’s incubator while I was still pregnant with Alfie. ‘It was so strange to be there with my newborn son, while I was still pregnant.’ Axel arrived on July 19, 2012 weighing just 1lb 12oz and required emergency treatment to keep him alive. He was wrapped in plastic to keep him warm and rushed to a specialist care unit. Alfie was delivered on July 24, weighing just under 2lb. The boys had almost arrived even earlier, after Miss Day’s waters broke when she was just 21 weeks pregnant. She said: ‘I felt two huge gushes and rushed to hospital immediately. Once I was there, I was told that my waters had broken. ‘A . team of neonatal specialists attended to me and told me that if the . boys started to arrive there and then, they were almost certain not to . survive. Axel (pictured) weighed just 1lb 12oz when he was born and required emergency treatment to keep him alive . After Axel's birth, Miss Day's cervix inexplicably closed again. As a result, Alfie (pictured) was not born immediately as expected. He was delivered after she went into labour again five days later . ‘They would have tried to save them, but the chances weren’t good. ‘I prayed for them to hang on to 24 weeks, to allow them to benefit from steroids to help their lungs develop.’ Amazingly, doctors managed to prevent the birth until Axel was born at 24 weeks – the legal abortion limit. In . the weeks following the birth Miss Day, a former nurse, and her . partner, Tom Perkins, 27, a telecoms project manager, were warned Axel . might not survive. Miss . Day, of Barwell in Leicestershire, said: ‘When I tell people our twins . were born five days apart, they’re always amazed. It’s not something you . hear about every day. ‘It . was touch and go after they were born. They were in intensive care for . four months. Doctors warned us at one point that Axel might not survive . 24 hours. ‘They came home on my 30th birthday - which was an enormous treat – and three weeks ago we were able to take Axel’s oxygen away. Miss Day says it was a surreal experience to see Axel in an incubator while she was still pregnant . Axel and Alfie (pictured together in an incubator) have not both learned to walk and talk but their development is expected to catch up with other children. They are pictured with their parents, Emma Day and Tom Perkins . ‘They’re doing fine now, considering what they’ve been through. They’re very loving towards one another.’ Axel required further steroid treatment as well as laser eye surgery and two operations to fix hernias. Alfie was born stronger than his brother but still required incubation and a course of antibiotics. Alfie was able to leave hospital after three months, and Alfie was to follow a month later, so that on Miss Day’s 30th birthday she had both her boys at home with her for the first time. Until three weeks ago, Axel required oxygen through a tube to aid his development. He is not walking yet and Alfie has yet to say his first words, but doctors are confident they are hitting the correct developmental milestones considering their rocky start in life. Miss Day said: ‘Last year we had one birthday for the two of them but this year we’re celebrating their birthdays on different days - they have different birthdays, whichever way you look at it. ‘Alfie is definitely the one in charge, but he’s very caring towards Axel. He’s always giving him hugs and even helps to put food into his mouth. He’s quite protective over him.’ Miss Day said: 'Alfie is definitely the one in charge, but he's very caring towards Axel.

"One of the world's rarest motorbikes once owned by Steve McQueen is expected to raise as much as $750,000 at auction next month. The canary yellow 1915 Cyclone was among Hollywood star McQueen's extensive collection of classic motorbikes when he died from cancer in 1980 aged 50. The Cyclone is one of the the most desirable motorbikes in the world due to its exclusivity - it was made for just three years between 1913 and 1916 and only six are known to exist today. Set for auction: This canary yellow 1915 Cyclone, expected to raise $750,000 at auction, was among McQueen's extensive collection of classic motorbikes when he died from cancer aged 50 . Hollywood royalty: Actor Steve McQueen famously loved motorbikes and fast cars and was known for performing his own stunts . They were built for board track racing, a popular motorsport where riders would compete around a huge bank-sided oval circuit similar in shape to a velodrome. The bikes, made without brakes, could hit record speeds of more than 110mph courtesy of a 996cc 45hp engine. Cyclones were sold for just $350 - the equivalent to about $7,000 today. But failures in various parts meant running costs were high and by 1916 the company behind them, the Joerns Motor Manufacturing Company, had folded. Extremely rare: The motorbike was made for just three years between 1913 and 1916 and only six are known to exist today . Worth a fortune: The Cyclone bike is tipped to fetch a staggering $750,000 when it goes under the hammer at Mecum Auctions in Las Vegas . It is not known how long McQueen, an avid motorcycle fan, had owned the Cyclone for when he died. He is best remembered for his role as Captain Virgil Hilts in the 1963 film The Great Escape, based on the story of an escape attempt from the Stalag Luft III POW camp in Poland. The iconic final scene sees McQueen's character jump a barbed wire fence on a motorbike before being captured by Nazi guards. The bikes, made without brakes, could hit speeds of more than 110mph courtesy of a 996cc 45hp engine . The Cyclone bike is tipped to fetch a staggering $750,000  when it goes under the hammer at Mecum Auctions in Las Vegas. That price would make it one of the most expensive motorbikes ever sold at auction. The world record was set last year when the Harley Davidson from the film Easy Rider sold for $1.3million. A spokesman for the auctioneers said: 'This combination of Steve McQueen and Cyclone is unique in the world - it is by far the most interesting motorcycle owned by the King of Cool.' The motorcycle was bought by world renowned American collector EJ Cole at an auction of McQueen's bikes in 1984, four years after his death, then restored to its former glory. Now 89 years old, Mr Cole has decided now is the right time to sell it off along with more than 220 vintage American motorbikes from his collection, which he has spent 50 years amassing. Famous scene: McQueen is best remembered for his role as Captain Virgil Hilts in the 1963 film The Great Escape, based on the story of an escape attempt from the Stalag Luft III POW camp in Poland . Mr Cole said: 'If my age hadn't gotten ahead of me I'd still be out trying to add to my collection, but being that I'm 89 I feel like it's time to quit. 'Here at my place nobody gets to see them and they need to be out where people can enjoy them.' The auction will be held in Las Vegas on March 20. McQueen's old vehicles have a history of attracting fortunes at auction and several cars once owned or driven in movies by the star have raised millions of dollars. In August last year, a British car collector spent £9million on a 1967 Ferrari because it was once owned by the actor. The actor bought the Ferrari 275 GTB/4 while filming police drama Bullitt. In the film, his character Frank Bullitt is followed in his 1967 Ford Mustang Fastback by a black Dodge Charger in one of the best car chase scenes in Hollywood history. McQueen insisted during filming that he would perform most of his own stunts, including the high-speed car chase.","1915 Cyclone was among McQueen's collection when he died in in 1980 .

"The decision to award the Golden Ball for the 2014 World Cup's best player to Argentina forward Lionel Messi has been greeted with surprise in many quarters. Messi performed well in the group stages, scoring four goals in three games against Bosnia, Iran and Nigeria but his star has faded since, with the Barcelona star failing to find the net in knockout matches against Switzerland, Belgium, Holland and Germany. In the final against Germany, Messi flashed one gilt-edged opportunity wide but otherwise struggled to influence proceedings.

Arjen Robben (Holland) - Although there were simulation antics, Robben's poise in . possession and potency in front of goal were deciding factors in Louis . van Gaal's team finishing third. Nonetheless, after the final whistle, he was presented with the adidas Golden Ball, ahead of other leading contenders such as Colombia's James Rodriguez, Holland's Arjen Robben and German trio Manuel Neuer, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Thomas Muller. It has led the conspiracy theorists to suggest that Messi, an ambassador for adidas, may have been granted preferential treatment, although it should be noted that the German firm also have links with Monaco star Rodriguez and they manufacture Germany kits. Further speculation was triggered when it emerged that for the first time the Golden Ball was decided by FIFA's Technical Committee, rather than by a media vote. The . general consensus, however, remains that Messi was a little fortunate to . receive the award and that his name and reputation may have earned him . the prize. Former .

"It may be the fastest animal to run on the Earth, but the cheetah could be racing to extinction. Scientists think the animals' speed has left them ill-equipped to deal with their modern environment. There are fewer than 10,000 cheetahs left in the wild - down from 100,000 a century ago. It may be the fastest animal to run on the Earth, but the cheetah could be racing to extinction. Scientists think the animals' speed has left them ill-equipped to deal with their modern environment . And the way they are built for speed - with a slimline build and low body mass - has left it less able to store energy when it is not sprinting. Before humans built across the African savannah where cheetahs hunt, this was not a problem. In times of plenty, the animals could rely on their 75mph speed to catch plenty of prey. But in the modern age, with their shrinking habitat squeezed on all sides by buildings and farmland, there is far greater competition for food from larger and stronger predators such as lions, leopards and hyeenas. There are fewer than 10,000 cheetahs left in the wild - down from 100,000 a century ago. With their shrinking habitat squeezed on all sides by buildings and farmland, there is far greater competition for food from larger and stronger predators such as lions, leopards and hyeenas . Academics at Queen's University Belfast found that they spend much of their time and energy slowly stalking the savannah in search of food - an activity they are not evolved for. While they are built for sharp bursts of speed, their lightweight frame means they cannot store energy for long treks. Lead researcher Dr Michael Scantlebury, whose paper is published in the journal Science, said: 'Cheetahs may be Ferraris but most of the time they are driving slowly. Wildlife populations around the world have more than halved in just four decades in the face of unsustainable human consumption, a report has warned. Mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish have declined on average by 52 per cent from 1970 to 2010, according to WWF's Living Planet Report, which uses information on 10,380 populations of 3,038 species to see how global wildlife is faring. Experts from the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), which maintains the database of information on the species, said the figures meant that where in 1970 there was a population of 100 animals, now there were only 50. For freshwater creatures, the situation is even worse, with population declines of more than three-quarters (76 per cent) in 40 years, the 'living planet index' of species shows. 'What our study showed was that their major energy costs seem to be incurred by travelling, rather than securing prey. 'If you can imagine walking up and down sand dunes in high temperatures day in, day out, with no water to drink you start to get a feel for how challenging these cats' daily lives are.' 'The reality may be that human activities – for example erecting fences that inhibit free travel or over-hunting cheetah prey – are forcing cheetahs to travel ever-increasing distances and that this may be compromising their energy more than any other single factor.' The team studied 19 free-roaming cheetahs each for two weeks across two sites in southern Africa, injecting them with a traceable substance and then collecting their droppings. Analysis of the waste showed how much of the substance they were losing each day, allowing the scientists to calculate their energy expenditure. Co-author Dr Nikki Marks, also from Queen's University Belfast said: 'Research of this type helps improve our understanding of the challenges facing cheetahs as they strive to survive and helps inform future decisions on conservation strategies for cheetahs and other threatened animals.' Dr John Wilson, of North Carolina State University in the US, who also worked on the resaerch, added: 'Too often we blame lions and hyenas for decimating cheetah populations when in fact, it is likely to be us humans that drive their declines. 'Imagine how hard it must be for a small cub to follow its mother further and further through the desert to look for food, while she herself is fighting for survival.' Academics at Queen's University Belfast found that they spend much of their time and energy slowly stalking the savannah in search of food - an activity they are not evolved for. While they are built for sharp bursts of speed, their lightweight frame means they cannot store energy for long treks .","Around 10,000 cheetahs in the wild, down from 100,000 a century ago .

"A gym instructor who paid £4,000 for a boob job was horrified when surgeons first made her breats too big - and then the implants exploded inside her. Kim Brockhurst, 51, went under the knife hoping to increase her 32AA breasts by two cup sizes. But she was shocked when she came round after the surgery to find she had a pair of huge DD breasts. Kim Brockhurst, 51, paid £4,000 for a boob job to increase her breast size from a 32AA to a 32B. When she woke up, she was horrified to discover she had been given DD breasts (pictured) Ms Brockhurst learned to live with her oversized chest until she discovered she had been given faulty PIP implants which had burst, leaking industrial grade silicone into her body. To make matters worse, she only learned of the problem when her new breasts became lumpy and misshapen. She said: ‘I was really flat chested and I wanted a bit more bounce. ‘So I saved up for the surgery hoping it would give me a nice confidence boost. ‘But I ended up with these big heavy breasts - much bigger than I’d asked for. ‘But it got worse when my breasts slowly went out of shape - it was a terrible time. After surgery Ms Brockhurst noticed her breasts becoming lumpy and misshapen. She then discovered she had been given faulty PIP implants which had to be removed. She is pictured after reconstructive surgery . Ms Brockhurst (pictured with her partner, George-Edward King) is now worried because she knows silicone from the implants leaked into her body and she doesn't know the long-term consequences . ‘Soon I had a big dent in my right breast and the implant on the left just exploded - leaking the implant’s industrial strength silicone into my breast tissue.’ Almost 50,000 women in the UK, and some 400,000 worldwide, were affected by the scandal which came to light after doctors found unexpectedly high numbers of women were suffering from ruptured implants. It  emerged that the French firm Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) had been manufacturing implants using industrial grade silicone intended for use in mattresses. Ms Brockhurst had just gone through a painful divorce when she had surgery in 2004. She asked doctors to boost her chest to a modest 32B. However, in June 2013, doctors confirmed her surgeon used the medically unauthorised PIP implants which were leaking and she says the implants were much bigger than she requested. She was then told they could be removed on the NHS, but not replaced. Ms Brockhurst, from Ebbw Vale, South Wales, said: ‘The NHS would take out the implants but wanted £3,800 to restructure my breasts. Ms Brockhurst says it was 'a terrible time' when her breast implants started to leak and became lumpy. She is pictured just after the initial boob job . Ms Brockhurst (pictured right after having reconstructive surgery following the removal of her PIP implants) says she is now happy having smaller breasts, which are better for her job as a yoga and Pilates instructor . ‘It was awful knowing I couldn’t afford that surgery but all the while I had silicone leaking into my body. I still don’t know where it’s gone and that’s a real worry.’ Ms Brockhurst finally had her breasts taken down to a more manageable 34D in an operation paid for and recorded by Channel 5 reality TV show Botched Up Bodies in July 2013. She says her new streamlined shape is ideal for her job teaching yoga and Pilates. She said: ‘Everyone says it’s taken years off me. ‘I can go out running again and dance and move without having to strap myself down. ‘Sometimes it’s nice not to have a big cleavage.’","Kim Brockhurst, 51, wanted to increase her breast size from a 32AA to a 32B .

"British scientists could have found the key to wiping out malaria-carrying mosquitoes - by developing a genetically modified species that produces just male offspring. Malaria is spread by infected female mosquitoes who pass on the killer disease when they bite humans. But Imperial College London researchers looked to genetics to disrupt the breeding of mosquitoes so fewer females are produced, which should see mosquitoes die out within a few generations. In lab tests they have modified mosquitoes to produce sperm that will only create males, pioneering a fresh approach to eradicating malaria. Genetically modified mosquitoes that almost exclusively produce male offspring could wipe out malaria . The new genetic method distorts the sex ratio of Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes, the main transmitters of the malaria parasite. In . the first laboratory tests, the method created a fully fertile mosquito . strain that produced 95 per cent male offspring, the study published in . the journal Nature Communications revealed. These were introduced to five caged wild-type mosquito populations. In four of the five cages, this eliminated the entire population within six generations, because of the lack of females. The . hope is that if this could be replicated in the wild, this would . ultimately cause the malaria-carrying mosquito population to crash. This is the first time that scientists have been able to manipulate the sex ratios of mosquito populations. Since . the millennium increased prevention and control measures have reduced . global malaria mortality rates by 42 per cent, but the disease remains a . prevalent killer especially in vulnerable sub-Saharan African regions. Malaria . control has also been threatened by the spread of insecticide resistant . mosquitoes and malaria parasites resistant to drugs. Releasing the GM mosquitoes into the wild could lead to the extinction of disease-carrying mosquitoes. Image shows a red blood cell deformed by the malaria parasite . Over 3.4 billion people are at risk from contracting malaria and an estimated 627,000 people die each year from the disease. Professor . Andrea Crisanti from the Department of Life Sciences said: 'Malaria is . debilitating and often fatal and we need to find new ways of tackling . it. We think our innovative approach is a huge step forward. 'For . the very first time, we have been able to inhibit the production of . female offspring in the laboratory and this provides a new means to . eliminate the disease.' Colleague Dr Nikolai Windbichler added: 'What is most promising about our results is that they are self-sustaining. 'Once . modified mosquitoes are introduced, males will start to produce mainly . sons, and their sons will do the same, so essentially the mosquitoes . carry out the work for us.' In this new experiment the scientists inserted a DNA cutting enzyme called I-PpoI into Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes. In . normal reproduction, half of the sperm bear the X chromosome and will . produce female offspring, and the other half bear the Y chromosome and . produce male offspring. The . enzyme that the researchers used works by cutting the DNA of the X . chromosome during production of sperm, so that almost no functioning . sperm carry the female X chromosome. As a result the offspring of the genetically modified mosquitoes was almost exclusively male. It took the researchers six years to produce an effective variant of the enzyme. Dr . Roberto Galizi said: 'The research is still in its early days, but I am . really hopeful that this new approach could ultimately lead to a cheap . and effective way to eliminate malaria from entire regions. 'Our goal is to enable people to live freely without the threat of this deadly disease.'","95% of eggs laid by the GM mosquitoes hatch into male offspring .

"A woman who says her huge 38KK breasts are ruining her life is outraged after being denied surgery to reduce them on the NHS. Kim Mills, 32, has been refused the operation even though she claims her enormous chest has caused arthritis of the spine. The mother-of-two has even lost 4st in a bid to shrink her chest - but it failed to help. Kim Mills has 38KK breasts and she says they are so big they have caused her to develop arthritis in her spine . Ms Mills has applied for funding to have her breasts reduced on the NHS but her request was refused . However, . her local Clinical Commissioning Group in Essex has denied her request to have her breasts reduced her to a D cup because her circumstances are ‘not exceptional’. Ms Mills says she is unable to afford to have the surgery carried out privately. She now . hopes that Jeremy Hunt’s call yesterday to stop cosmetic procedures . being carried out on the NHS will free up money for surgery like hers. Yesterday, . Mr Hunt said the taxpayer should not be funding cosmetic surgery and . that there should be a clampdown on NHS spending on it. Ms Mills, a resource planning analyst, said: ‘People may think it's not a serious health issue but they don't have to live with it. ‘My breasts are so heavy and I'm only 5ft 8in. It affects everything from cleaning to struggling to brush my four-year-old daughter's hair. ‘If I attempt to go for a run I'm left in agony, it's horrendous. The NHS are happy to shell out boob jobs for vanity reasons but I just want a reduction so I can live normally.’ Ms Mills, from Chelmsford, Essex, was wearing a 38DD by the age of 13 and had was a KK by her early 20s. Ms Mills has lost 4st in a bid to shrink her breasts but it failed to reduce their size . While her friends longed for bigger breasts, the mother-of-two hated her chest and the unwanted attention it attracted from men. On nights out men would make lewd comments about her chest, despite Ms Mills always making sure her big bust was covered. With her self-esteem at a low point, she turned to comfort eating and by 2010 had ballooned to 19st 8Ibs. Yesterday the Health Secretary said cosmetic surgery should not be paid for by the tax payer. He said there should be a clampdown on NHS spending and that he could understand public anger at high profile cases of breast enlargements and dental work being offered by the NHS. Mr Hunt insisted all decisions must be taken on ‘clinical need’ and public money must not be used to pay for surgery just to improve someone's looks. He said: ‘We should not be doing cosmetic work on the NHS. 'The decisions are taken on the basis of clinical need, but I have made it very clear that I am against purely cosmetic work being done. ‘There will be times when there is a mental health need, which the local doctor has said is very serious. ‘But I do completely understand people’s reservations about some of the things that happen.’ Despite this, her weight did not affect her bust size and she stayed a massive 38KK. ‘I . hated my boobs so much I comfort ate,’ she said. ‘I would snack on . chocolate and sweets when I was feeling low, and soon my waistline . started to grow but my boobs didn't. ‘At my biggest weight I felt so depressed that I decided to lose weight in an attempt to shed some pounds from my boobs as well. But it was to no avail.’ Now her 4st weight loss has failed to help, she says her situation is becoming desperate. Last month she was diagnosed with arthritis of the spine and believes her breasts are to blame. She claims the fear of showing a man her large chest has also prevented her from having a relationship for the past three years. Ms Mills said: ‘Mr Hunt's comments really ring true for me. The use of NHS funds for glamour and vanity reasons is disgraceful. ‘It seems wrong that I should be denied a breast reduction on the NHS when it is seriously affecting my health. ‘If the government stop the funding for cosmetic procedures then that might leave enough funding to help people who need the operations for medical reasons.’ The single mother, who lives with daughters, Alana, 14, and Alyssa-Mae, four, added that the condition is affecting her mental health. She said: ‘People see me as a confident girl, but it is far from the truth. I have no self-esteem because my chest has ruined my life. ‘I've lost all my confidence and haven't been seen naked by a man for three years. Ms Mills (pictured with her daughter, Alana) says her breasts are so big that exercise leaves her in agony . Ms Mills is angry that other women have been given boob jobs on the NHS for cosmetic reasons . ‘The thought of showing a man my chest horrifies me because they're so heavy and saggy. Wherever I go men make lewd comments at me, it's embarrassing. ‘Women are always getting boobs jobs and nose jobs on the NHS, it seems unfair I can't get a breast reduction when it isn't just for cosmetic reasons but for my health. ‘Girls out there are getting nose jobs and boobs jobs on the NHS, going up from As to DDs. So it seems unfair I can't get a breast reduction. ‘I have never been on benefits in my life, and I'm a single working mum so I can't afford to pay for the surgery privately. ‘I can't get involved with my children when they are playing, and I look ridiculous. ‘Where ever I go people stare at my chest or make lewd comments. I hate it and the NHS won't do anything.’ Last year, NHS surgeons carried out 790 breast implant operations costing the taxpayer approximately £3.5 million. A spokesperson for Mid Essex Clinical Commissioning Group said: 'New evidence has been submitted regarding this case and it is due to be considered again in early July so we cannot comment any further. Mid Essex CCG do not fund cosmetic surgery.'","Kim Mills, 32, says her enormous breasts are ruining her life and her health .

"A Pennsylvania teenager is being hailed a hero after he pulled the fire alarm to alert other students that a knife-wielding 16-year-old was on a stabbing spree at Franklin Regional High School Wednesday morning. Nate Scimio is among 20 people - 19 students and a school security guard - who were injured in the frightening attack that began around 7:13 a.m. at the Murrysville school. Murrysville Police Chief Thomas Seefeld said Nate's courageous move to set off the campus fire alarm prevented more stabbings - and possibly saved lives. Scroll down for video . Hero: Nate Scimio, pictured, posted this image to Instagram after the attack in which he is believed to have pulled the fire alarm to alert other students . 'It was a good thing that was done,' Seefeld told a news conference Wednesday morning. The brave teen, who is recovering at UPMC Children's Hospital, posted a picture of himself wearing a hospital gown later this morning, with the caption 'Chillin' at Children's.' Not only did Nate alert other students to the emergency and encourage them to run away, he is also believed to have been injured when he stepped in front of other students to protect them. From the photo it appears Nate suffered cuts to his right arm but he seemed to be in good condition. Suspected stabber: Alex Hribal, pictured left and right, reportedly stabbed 20 people Wednesday morning at his Pennsylvania high school . Injuries: Police confirmed 20 victims were injured in the early morning attack . Seefeld also applauded the bravery of assistant principal Sam King who he said wrestled the suspect - who CBS Pittsburgh later identified as Alex Hribal - to the ground. The teen was then handcuffed by a resource officer who had earlier called 911. 'There was a school principal who had contact with the juvenile and that led to his (arrest),' Seefeld said. In a press conference, Dr Mark Rubino from Forbes Hospital credited another hero with potentially saving a life - a young girl who applied pressure to her friend who was seriously injured. Her name is not yet known. Dr Rubino said: 'She displayed an amazing amount of composure to help that friend who was losing a lot of blood. She probably played a significant role in his ability to survive this.' Kristen Beard told NBC News she talked to her injured friend about the spring dance to keep him conscious. She said she spotted the suspect running down the halls with 'a knife in each hand' and then noticed her friend. 'and when I looked back, I saw [him] fall,' she told the network. Tears: Parents and students embrace along School Road near Franklin Regional High School after more than a dozen students were stabbed . Patients: Multiple students were in critical condition after the stabbing though some were released from hospital a few hours later . 'He said, ""Help, I'm hurt,""' Beard said. She said she tried to pull him into a classroom to safety when a teacher came to the rescue. He had a wound to the lower back, she said, adding that she spoke to him about the prom. Beard said another student in the room was throwing up and coming in and out of consciousness and had a very severe wound to the stomach.' She said she was interviewed by the FBI so didn't go with her friend to the hospital. But she later learned he lost a kidney in the attack. Five students remain in critical condition following the early morning attack. The suspect was driven from Murrysville police station to a nearby hospital just before 10:30a.m. to be treated for cuts to his hands or wrists. It's not yet clear what the motive was for the stabbing or whether the suspect was targeting anyone in particular. Nate was being lauded on Twitter by users following the stabbing that has shaken the community. One tweeted: 'A hero emerges from a tragedy. Good thinking, Nate Scimio.

"Harassment: Earl Sampson, 28, was questioned by police 258 times, searched more than 100 times, jailed 56 times and arrested for trespassing 62 times at his place of work . A Florida convenience store owner and his employee plan to sue the city of Miami Gardens and its police department for racial profiling after his employee was questioned by police 258 times, searched more than 100 times, jailed 56 times and arrested for trespassing 62 times. Alex Saleh, the proprietor at the 207 Quickstop on Northwest 207 Street in Miami Gardens, said he has more than two dozen surveillance videos to support his case. The employee at the centre of the controversy, Earl Sampson, 28, says police officers constantly harass him while he’s at work, sometimes two to three times a day, without any justified cause. ‘They’re always stopping me, going in my pockets, asking me for my ID, running my name,’ Sampson told CBS4. ‘I feel like I can’t even be in my own neighborhood anymore.’ In three separate instances on the video clips, police can be seen questioning the same man at the same location. Sampson’s lengthy rap sheet is filled with minor infractions, including more than 60 citations for trespassing, mostly at the 207 Quickstop, where he works. ‘I’ve seen the outrageous police abusing people in the community. They’ve been treating the people wrong, Saleh said. Proof: The proprietor at the 207 Quickstop on Northwest 207 Street in Miami Gardens, Florida, said he has more than two dozen surveillance videos to support his case . 'Always stopping me': Sampson says the police are always going through his pockets, asking me for his ID and running name checks on him. 'I feel like I can't even be in my own neighborhood anymore,' he says . Shocking: In three separate instances on the video clips, police can be seen questioning Sampson at the store where he is at work . Saleh, Sampson and their attorney Steve Lopez plan to file a federal civil rights lawsuit soon against the police department. The complaint will allege officers have been instructed to illegally stop and search citizens via racial profiling. ‘They’re stopping people for no reason in front of the business. Anywhere. Illegally search people,’ Saleh told CBS4. Mayor Oliver Gilbert said he would not comment on pending litigation, however just two weeks ago, following a string of recent shootings, Gilbert explained the city’s crime-reduction strategy. ‘The line is zero tolerance,’ Gilbert explained to Pastrana. ‘So if you break a law, you’re going to jail.’ 'Abuse': The convenience store owner, Alex Saleh, says he has seen 'the outrageous police abusing people in the community. They've been treating the people wrong', he claims .

No reason: In this image, Sampson can be seen, bottom right, wearing black clothes, stocking up a fridge as an officer comes in and starts questioning him without any cause . But Sampson argues he has not broken the law the times he was stopped for trespassing at his place of employment.

"A mother-of-two says having a baby saved her life because she found a lump in her breast while breastfeeding. Gill Thomson, 37, noticed a fast-growing lump in her breast five months after her son Jack was born. Initially, she suspected it was simply a blocked milk duct and didn’t consider the possibility it could be a tumour, even when her GP suggested screening as a precaution. Gill Thomson, 37, was diagnosed with breast cancer after finding a lump while breastfeeding her son, Jack . But Mrs Thomson, from Edinburgh, received the devastating diagnosis after being referred to a specialist breast cancer centre. The communications manager, who has now made a full recovery, said: ‘I feel really lucky because doctors think there was a very good chance I had the cancer while I was pregnant. ‘Obviously it was a massive shock. It’s overwhelming to think that if it wasn’t for Jack, it might not have been caught so quickly and it might have been too late for me. ‘I was petrified, thinking how am I going to look after my children while dealing with cancer?’ It’s natural that you fear the worst.’ After the joy of giving birth to Jack, now two, the cancer diagnosis came as a terrible shock to Mrs Thomson, husband David and their daughter Maisie, five. Doctors at Edinburgh’s Western General Hospital suspected that hormones had accelerated the tumour’s growth, making it bigger but easier to detect. Mrs Thomson (pictured with her husband, David, son, Jack, and daughter, Maisie) had to have chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery before she was given the all-clear . The diagnosis forced Mrs Thomson to stop breastfeeding while she underwent a series of tests before starting her treatment. And she had to leave her family for 24 hours to protect the children from the possibility of radiation after being injected with a special dye to see if the cancer had spread. She said: ‘Five months after giving birth to my baby boy, we found ourselves in a small consulting room hearing the life-changing news that I would begin chemotherapy in less than two weeks. ‘It sounds really melodramatic, but having to stay that night at my parents’ house before finding out if it had spread was definitely the hardest part. A lump or area of thickened tissue in either breast. A change in the size or shape of one or both breasts. Discharge from either nipple or a lump or swelling in either armpit. Dimpling on the skin of the breasts or a rash on or around the nipple. Pain in either breast. Source: NHS Choices . ‘I ended up having to turn all of the photos of the kids face down because it was just so heart-breaking. ‘You almost feel like you have let them down, which I know is stupid. I was worrying what they were going to do if the worse-case scenario happened.’ Within a fortnight, Mrs Thomson was on a trial of a strong chemotherapy drug, which caused her immune system to weaken and her hair to fall out. But the morning after her first session, the family were shattered by more misfortune when Mr Thomson was knocked off his bike in a hit-and-run incident. The accident left him on crutches with Mrs Thomson having to take up the role of childcare - all while suffering the ill-effects of chemotherapy. She said: ‘It was just ridiculous - our family truly have been through hell and back. At that point I remember thinking “how could things get any worse?”’ Despite Mrs Thomson’s early treatment, the tumour continued to grow, and she had a lumpectomy before she continued with chemotherapy. She was put through daily radiotherapy for five weeks early in 2013 before being given the all-clear a year ago. Health professionals recommend that she remained on medication to suppress her levels of oestrogen, a hormone known to encourage growth in some breast cancers. Mrs Thomson (pictured with Jack) says she believes the cancer wouldn't have been diagnosed so early if she hadn't been breastfeeding and credits Jack with saving her life . She will go through the menopause early, leaving her unable to have more children. But the mother-of-two said it was a price that she was more than willing to pay for the chance of a long life with her family. She said: ‘Breastfeeding made me a lot more aware than I’d usually be and probably helped me to notice sooner that I had quite a big lump. ‘I’m just so glad I got it checked or there could have been a very different outcome. ‘The kids have both been amazing and - with mine and David’s family - they have all really helped me through a tough time. ‘I’m just so happy to be at the other end and be all-clear from cancer now. I know not everyone’s as lucky as me but it may not always be the worse-case scenario. ‘I want people to know that you can get over this and there’s so much support out there.’ Gillian Smith, director of the Royal College of Midwives, said Mrs Thomson’s story showed how important it was for health professionals not to be complacent with changes to women’s breasts when lactating. She said: ‘We have to be careful that we don’t assume that every lump and bump women have is a blocked milk duct. ‘It’s absolutely the right route that everyone’s taken here - if there’s anything suspicious at all, don’t make an assumption, make sure it gets checked out.’","Gill Thomson found a lump when her son, Jack, was five months old .

"Girls as young as 11 find e-cigarettes ‘highly appealing’ and the use of the devices among children is ‘widespread’, worrying new research has found. The study authors say this is because children can easily get the devices from friends, parents and shops. The report, for Public Health Wales, also found . girls with low aspirations who do not take part in sports or . after-school activities are the most likely to smoke e-cigarettes. Electronic cigarettes are 'highly appealing' to young girls, new research suggests . Smoking among girls aged 11 and 12 in North Wales was examined and researchers found children are more likely to start smoking if their parents do. They also found smoking rates among young girls are highest in deprived communities. Andrew Jones, executive director of public health for Betsi Cadwaladr, the health board for North Wales, said: ‘Two per cent of 11 to 12 year old girls smoke, with prevalence rising to five per cent in some communities. ‘The study found that awareness and use of e-cigarettes was commonplace in some areas. ‘Most of the girls who took part in focus groups could name at least five different flavours of vapours which include strawberry milkshake, gummy bear and bubble gum. ‘Some were . not aware that e-cigarettes could have nicotine in them and most felt . that e-cigarettes were “not as bad” as cigarettes.’ The . study authors are now calling for a review of education programmes to . ensure children and young people get the correct information about . tobacco and e-cigarettes. They also recommend introducing control . measures for the sale of e-cigarettes to children both online and on the . high street and ‘strengthening activities to raise aspirations and . build confidence in young girls’. Two per cent of 11 and 12-year-old schoolgirls smoke - and they are more likely to if they parents do . The news comes just days after leading health experts said e-cigarettes should be subject to much more stringent controls to ensure they are safe. More than 100 experts sent a letter to the World Health Organization outlining their concerns about what the unregulated products might contain. They fear manufacturers of electronic nicotine devices are 'making false and unproven claims, misleading the public into thinking these products are harmless (they are not) and effective cessation aids (which is unknown)'. Another recent study, by scientists at the University of California, San Francisco, suggested e-cigarettes could be responsible for a new generation becoming hooked on nicotine. It showed teenagers who use the devices are more likely to smoke traditional cigarettes and are less likely to kick the habit. As the popularity of e-cigarettes - promoted as a way to help people quit smoking - increases, scientists found ‘the wild west marketing of e-cigarettes is not only encouraging youth to smoke them, but also it is promoting regular cigarette smoking among youth.’","About two per cent of 11 and 12-year-old girls in North Wales smoke .

"Younger siblings are more likely to take their own lives than their older brothers or sisters, a new study has today found. The study, carried out at Stockholm University, estimated that more than 20 per cent of suicides could be influenced by birth order and a mother's age at child birth. For each increase in a person's birth order, from eldest to youngest child, the suicide risk in adulthood went up 18 per cent, according to the study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology. A study carried out at the University of Stockholm found younger siblings are more likely to commit suicide . Study leader Mikael Rostila, of the university's Centre for Health Equity Studies, told Live Science: 'Our findings are important, . since they highlight that birth order should be considered an early-life . circumstance that determines mental health across the life course.' The report said: 'Recent studies have indicated that birth order is associated with suicide risk, with later-born children experiencing an increased risk of suicide. 'It has been estimated that more than 20 per cent of suicides might be attributable to the combined effects of maternal age at child birth and birth order.' Researchers say they still do not understand why younger siblings may be at a higher risk of committing suicide. It means there is little information researchers can pass on to family's to help protect youngest siblings. The study also found that younger siblings were more likely to die from an accidents. It suggests those with a higher birth order are more impulsive or risk-prone, which could contribute to suicide, researchers said. It raises the possibility that . younger brothers and sisters are more risk-prone or impulsive in general, which . could contribute to suicide, the researchers said. Several past studies have found birth order has an affected on a person's health. A study in February found eldest siblings may have a higher risk of diabetes and heart disease, linked to a metabolic patterns in the womb. Researchers say bullying by older siblings, the fact youngest children can be more impulsive and a lack of attention from parents could be reasons. File picture . But differences between families and parenting makes the affects difficult to judge. Another study of 1.7 million people carried out in Norway found that for each increase in birth order, suicide risk went up 46 per cent, according to results published in the journal last year. The new study replicated the findings from the research done in Norway. Rostila and his team examined births and deaths of everyone born in Sweden between 1931 and 1980. They then recorded deaths from 1981 to 2002. Their findings found the later a person's birth order was, the higher their risk for suicide was. 'Our findings are important, . since they highlight that birth order should be considered an early-life . circumstance that determines mental health across the life course' - Study leader Mikael Rostila . And the team found the link between birth order and suicide remained even when other factors, including the age difference between siblings, the number of siblings, their marital status and socioeconomic status was taken into account. Rostilla said the reasons are not clear, but suggested bullying by older siblings, and the fact parents rarely lavish as much attention on later-borns as they did their first child, could play a part. 'Lower levels of attachment to parents because of restrictions in quality time could give rise to emotional and behavioral problems, separation stress and psychiatric disorders, thereby contributing to a higher suicide risk among later-born siblings,' Rostila said. Another possibility is that the risk is linked to a biological explanation. Greater stress during later pregnancies could lead to the unborn child being exposed to higher levels of the hormone cortisol, which affects brain development. The World Health Organisation's latest statistics, for 2011, show Sweden's suicide rate is 11.1 suicides per 100,000 people.

"Fertility treatment can painfully expensive and many infertile couples scrimp and save for years to be able to afford it. But a growing number of people are turning to a more novel way of funding treatment - getting others to donate to their cause. Some American couples have raised up to $20,000 thanks to the kindness of strangers. One such pair are Bryan and Lisa Heine, from Bloomington, Illinois, who used a crowdfunding site to raise the $6,000 (£3,500) they needed to pay for an egg donor. Bryan and Lisa Heine raised $6,000 for fertility treatment through a crowdfunding website . Amazingly, they raised the money in just four months and are now waiting to be matched with a donor. They received 43 donations ranging from $10 to $500. The couple, who married in August 2005 and started trying for a baby a year later, became concerned when they'd had no success after 18 months. Mrs Heine, 32, went to see a doctor, who gave her devastating news. Not only did she have polycystic ovary syndrome and an underactive thyroid, there was a tumour on her pituitary gland in the brain. The gland helps control the balance of hormones in the body and a tumour on it can disrupt this function, making infertility much more likely. Mrs Heine, a beauty teacher, was put on medication to balance her hormones in the hope this would enable her to conceive. But a year later, they had still not been successful. The couple were amazed to reach their fundraising target in just four months after donations flooded in . In January 2011, Mrs Heine was told her tumour had grown and that it had haemorrhaged. As a result, in May 2011, she had surgery to remove the tumour and, miraculously, in September she discovered she was pregnant. Writing on her GoFundMe crowdsourcing page, she said: ‘At the very end of an appointment [with my doctor] she had me take a pregnancy test, just to make sure. ‘The lab technician came rushing out of her room as I was leaving mine and we almost smacked right into each other, then she held out her hands and there was my test with two little lines. 'I was shocked! Bryan and I were thrilled - we were on cloud nine!’ UK: . In the UK, the fertility treatment available to couples on the NHS depends on what their individual primary care trust offers. This varies across the UK and waiting lists can be very long. In general, women under 40 are entitled to three cycles of IVF on the NHS if they have been trying to get pregnant for at least two years or if they have failed to conceive following 12 cycles of artificial insemination. In some cases, women between the ages of 40 and 42 are also offered one cycle of IVF. Some couples choose to go private to avoid the long NHS waiting times, or to have more cycles than the NHS offers. One cycle of IVF carried out privately costs about £3,500.U.S: . In the U.S. some states offer IVF paid for by insurance, but many do not. For couples whose insurance does not cover IVF, there are a few grants available. But, the only option for many couples is to pay for it themselves and this can cost thousands of dollars. But tragically, two days later, she discovered it was an ectopic pregnancy which was developing in one of her fallopian tubes. Mrs Heine had to have surgery to end the pregnancy and to remove the fallopian tube. Determined not to give up, in 2012 the couple started IVF treatment. They were devastated when they were told not a single embryo had survived during any of their three cycles of treatment. The only option they had left was to try and conceive using a donor egg - an expensive process they couldn't afford. It was for this reason that they turned to crowdfunding through the website gofundme.com . Mrs Heine said: ‘Although we experienced so much loss, we are still extremely hopeful that we can still become parents. ‘This entire experience has been an emotional and financial burden on us, but Bryan and I remain a strong couple determined to conquer these obstacles together. She added: ‘We continue to pray and have faith that we were meant to have a child to love and help grow.’ Amazingly, in April, just four months after they started fundraising, the couple reached their $6,000 target - and are now waiting to be matched with a donor. Mrs Heine told Fox News: ‘It was difficult at first, because I know the baby won’t have any of my features, but we’re okay with that now.’ She added: ‘Everyone’s donated so much money to be able to do this and there’s always that fear in the back of our heads. ‘What if this doesn’t work? All these people donated for this happy ending and what if we don’t get one?’","Bryan and Lisa Heine, from Illinois, raised the money within just four months .

"A mother whose aorta burst when she was eight months pregnant ended up having life-saving surgery during which her baby was also delivered. Edita Tracey, 35, suffered a foot-long rupture in the main blood vessel taking blood from her heart to the rest of her body. Miraculously, she is now back at home with her daughter and is expected to make a full recovery. Edita Tracey, 35, nearly died when her aorta ruptured when she was 36 weeks pregnant . Mrs Tracey, from Philadelphia, was 36 weeks pregnant and in the hairdressers when she started suffering pain back pain, Fox 29 reports. She says the pain was not severe – it was more of a pressing pain. She phoned her husband, Ken, who was on a business trip but said he would fly home immediately. But when the pain spread to her chest, she called an ambulance. She told Fox 29: ‘The last thing I remember is emergency people coming, and that's it. I don't remember anything else.’ Mrs Tracey was rushed to hospital where tests revealed her aorta - the largest blood vessel in the human body - had ruptured and she did not have long to live. Medics immediately sent Mrs Tracey’s scans to a cardiologist and organised for her to be airlifted to another hospital. Mrs Tracey had nine hours of emergency surgery during which baby Arabella was delivered and her aorta was repaired. She and Arabella are pictured with her husband, Ken . Amazingly, baby Arabella did not suffer any ill effects as a result of her traumatic birth . When she arrived she was rushed into emergency surgery and within 30 seconds of her being put to sleep, her baby had been delivered. Miraculously, Arabella was born completely healthy and weighing 6lbs 12oz. Mrs Tracey was extremely lucky to survive the rupture in her aorta as it is the largest blood vessel in the body. Image shows an aorta . However, her mother remained in surgery for nearly nine hours as surgeons fought to repair the foot-long tear in her aorta. Dr Omar Lattouf, the cardiologist, said it was the most complicated case he had ever encountered in his 30 years of operating. He had to drain all of the blood that was gathering around her heart, before putting her on a heart and lung bypass machine. The surgical team then had to reduce her body temperature to prevent brain damage while they repaired her aorta. While Mrs Tracey was still in surgery, her husband arrived at the hospital and was able to hold Arabella for the first time. He told Fox 29: ‘You think about the baby, this should be a joyous occasion. And now your mind goes right back, it goes right back to if she's going to make it. The whole night was up and down.’ It was not until the next day that Mrs Tracey woke up. She was in intensive care but was able to be brought her newborn baby. She is now recovering at home and says she is incredibly grateful to the surgeons who saved her life. She is expected to make a full recovery but doctors are still trying to establish why her aorta ruptured. They believe she may have developed pre-eclampsia as a result of the pregnancy and that this could have caused her blood pressure to increase, putting pressure on her aorta.","Edita Tracey, 35, called an ambulance when she developed bad chest pains .

"A baby born without an immune system is trialling a world-first gene therapy cure to ‘re-boot’ her body’s defence systems and give her the chance of life outside a sterilised environment. Seventeen-month-old Nina Warnell suffers from Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Syndrome (SCID) - an inherited condition known as ‘bubble baby’ syndrome - which affects just one in 300,000 babies. She has all the appearance of a healthy child but her body is unable to fight even the mildest germs - meaning even a cough or sneeze could kill her. Nina Warnell, 17-months-old, was born with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Syndrome which means her body is unable to fight germs . The radical new treatment - devised by doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital - has its risks but Nina’s parents Graeme and Aga Warnell, from Maidenhead, have been left with few choices. ‘With Nina’s condition, you’re against a ticking clock,’ said Mr Warnell, 43, a real estate project manager. ‘If you don’t do anything within the year, the chances of recovery and survival are very limited. ‘It’s very rare that a child survives beyond two if nothing is done.’ Nina was diagnosed in March 2012 after her mother became concerned that she was sleeping too much and not feeding properly. At five-weeks-old she was admitted to hospital where doctors discovered that she had multiple infections including advanced pneumonia. Nina (pictured with parents, Aga and Graeme) is having a world-first gene therapy treatment to 're-boot' her body's defence systems and give her the chance of life outside a sterilised environment . The treatment works by re-engineering Nina's bone marrow to add a vital missing gene. Doctors hope that this will allow her body to create its own immune system . She was placed in isolation to stop her coming into contact with any more disease and the infections were tackled with a cocktail of antibiotics and anti-viral drugs. The family had to scrub down and wear masks and gowns before being allowed through an airlock-type room to see their critically ill daughter. Things then went from bad to worse as doctors told them Nina needed an urgent bone marrow transplant for any chance of survival. Both her sisters and parents did not match and so Mr and Mrs Warnell campaigned for the public to register as donors with the Anthony Nolan Trust and equivalent charities abroad. Nina (pictured moments after her birth) was believed to be a healthy baby until her mother noticed that she was sleeping a lot and not feeding well. She was admitted to hospital at five-weeks-old . Tests revealed that she was suffering from numerous infections. She was diagnosed with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Syndrome and put on the bone marrow donor list but no match could be found . But with Nina getting worse by the day the family decided to move her to Great Ormond Street. Over the following months she slowly started to recover and finally put on weight and doctors managed to create an ‘artificial’ immune system for her. She has to take 15 medications a day and immunoglobulin transfusions every three weeks to maintain it - but it is still very weak. At this point, Professor Bobby Gaspar, a consultant in paediatric immunology, approached the family about the possibility of gene therapy - and things are now starting to look brighter. A team led by the professor is in the process of trialling a new form of gene therapy on the youngster. Nina was getting sicker by the day waiting for a transplant so her parents moved her to Great Ormond Street Hospital for pioneering treatment . Doctors used an extensive drug regime to create an 'artificial immune system' for her but she is still very weak . Nina is missing a gene which produces an enzyme vital to the production of a healthy immune system. The doctors have harvested her bone marrow and have re-engineered it using a new type of ‘reprogrammed virus’ to splice the vital gene she is missing into her DNA profile. The re-engineered bone marrow has been re-inserted into her body and they hope a fully functioning immune system will develop. Doctors estimate a 60 to 90 per cent chance of success. Professor Gaspar told MailOnline that he hopes this form of gene therapy will be able to help many other children as well, and that it could eventually replace bone marrow transplants as the main form of treatment for children with immunodeficiency. As part of the treatment, Nina underwent a session of chemotherapy to wipe her existing bone marrow so that the new one can grow in its place. They are trying a new treatment which involves harvesting some of her bone marrow and re-engineering it to include a vital gene that she was missing. They hope this will allow her body to create its own immune system . She has suffered sickness and lost some of her light-blonde hair in the process. She also had to be housed in a sterilised room during treatment to minimise the risk of catching a potentially fatal disease. SCID is a genetic disorder which results in a poor antibody response to germs. It is the most severe form of primary immunodeficiency and can be caused by any one of nine different gene mutations. It is also known as the bubble boy disease because one patient, David Vetter, became famous for spending 12 years living in a sterile bubble. Patients are usually affected by severe infections early in their life - these can include pneumonia, meningitis and ear infections. If left untreated, the babies usually die within one year. The most common treatment is a bone marrow transplant. There were several scares after she contracted a virus and the bone marrow became contaminated with bacteria when it was inserted into her body. However, Mr Warnell said that in ‘true Nina style’ she fought them off and her cell count started to move slowly in the right direction. As this is a pioneering treatment, . the long-term outlook for Nina is unclear and it could be months, years . or even decades for side effects to surface. Nina . returned home last month but the family will not know if her body has . started producing its own immune system until Christmas. If the gene therapy treatment is found to be unsuccessful, Nina will require a bone marrow transplant. Although . a potential match has been found - this is not the preferred option as . Nina would require more aggressive chemotherapy and face the risk that . her body will reject the donor marrow. Mr . Warnell, who has another daughter, Megan, 11, from a previous marriage, . said: ‘When I look back at the last year of what we’ve been through and . what’s happened to our family, it’s very hard to describe. ‘I . can only really summarise it as like playing a record and someone just . grabs the needle and pulls it straight off with a horrendous scratch and . then there’s just silence.’ Nina (pictured with her sister, Mia, three) also had chemotherapy to wipe her existing bone marrow and allow the new marrow to grow. Doctors believe there is a 60 to 90 per cent chance the treatment will be a success . However, they have been buoyed by Nina’s ‘fighting spirit’ which has seen her battle through several close scrapes. He . added: ‘Nina has maintained this internal resilience, which has baffled . some of the doctors, where by, she has fought through all of these . things whilst having no real immune system. ‘There is no medical answer why, she just has a very strong constitution which has enabled her to survive. ‘She’s . now, in a very strange way, a very confident baby, in that she’s so . used to being examined by doctors and people looking at her, people . prodding, poking her, injecting her, that she’s almost a child that . welcomes any form of human interaction in the hospital, especially as . when at home she’s quite isolated.’ Since . Nina left hospital, the family have had to turn their house into a . quarantine zone and must screen everyone, and everything, that enters . the house. Nina has now been allowed home but her parents will not know whether the treatment has worked until Christmas. They have to disinfect everything (pictured) to ensure she is not exposed to germs . Mrs Warnell, 39, said: ‘We sterilise probably three to four times a day and then anything that drops on the floor has to be washed and sterilised again. ‘There’s also obsessive hand-washing. This is a house of compulsive hand-washers, but it has worked, it has really prevented any infections.’ The barriers they have had to impose on Nina has been particularly hard on the couple’s other daughter Mia, three. She has to have limited contact with other children because of the risk of picking up a cold. Mr Warnell said he often sees her staring longingly out of the window at the other kids playing outside.

"They say that teenage years can be the best of a person's life. But for one 13-year-old, too much fun or excitement could be fatal. Hannah Bowness-Major's organs start to shut down if she becomes too excited or stressed and her heart has already stopped four times. She suffers from Addison's disease, which affects just 160 children in the UK, and her mother, Karen, is terrified she will eventually fail to recover from an attack. Hannah Bowness-Major can't have too much fun as a rare condition means excitement could kill her . The teenager, from Cheshire, needs a cocktail of 30 drugs a day just so she can lead a normal life and she suffers from severe allergies that also put her at risk. Hannah’s adrenal glands do not produce enough of the hormone cortisol and if the body’s levels of this chemical drop too far, it can be fatal. Cortisol is vital to the functioning of the body because it helps to regulate blood pressure and allows the body to deal with stress. If levels of the hormone in the body fall suddenly, symptoms such as vomiting, abdominal pain, low blood pressure and collapse can develop. This can be fatal if it is not treated quickly. Addison’s disease can also cause weakness, fatigue, loss of appetite and dizziness. Hannah (pictured in hospital) has Addison's disease which means her adrenal gland doesn't produce enough of the hormone cortisol. Cortisol is vital as it helps regulate blood pressure and the immune system . Hannah has to take a cocktail of 30 drugs a day to enable her to live a nearly normal life . Hannah said: ‘Living with my condition has sort of just become routine now because I have suffered with it for most of my life. ‘My friends know to tell me if they have something in their lunchbox that I could be allergic too. ‘But thankfully most of the things I'm allergic to my friends don't like anyway - so I have got that one in the bag. ‘I do miss out a bit when my friends go swimming because I can't go but I can still try and do most of the things they do.’ Addison's disease is a condition in which the body does not make enough of the hormone cortisol. When the body's cortisol levels drop too low, this can cause a range of symptoms. These include weakness, dizziness, fatigue and abdominal pain. A very low cortisol level can be life-threatening. This is because cortisol is vital as it helps regulate blood pressure and the immune system and it helps the body respond to stress. Addison's disease is treated with hormone replacement tablets. It is thought about 8,000 people in the UK have the illness and most cases first develop in people aged between 30 and 50. About 70 per cent of cases are thought to be caused by an autoimmune disease but it can also be triggered by TB. Source: patient.co.uk . When Hannah gets excited, stressed or worried her body goes into an adrenal crisis which can cause her to faint or collapse. The condition, which she was diagnosed with in 2006 after routine blood tests, means she needs to be very careful about her choice of activities. Mrs Bowness-Major, 38, said: ‘When she gets too excited her body can't cope and shuts down. ‘She has collapsed on a trip to the Trafford Centre before now because of too much excitement. ‘It is physically and emotionally crippling to see Hannah looking at her younger sister on her bike or at swimming and you can see her wishing that she could do the same.’ Hannah’s condition means her body also struggles to fight infections because cortisol is important in controlling the immune system. As a result, even a common cold could make her severely ill. Mrs Bowness-Major, who works as a florist, said: ‘She can't go on public transport in case someone has a cold and sneezes on her. ‘She caught a stomach bug in 2010 and we really thought we were going to lose her. ‘Her body was shutting down and doctors had told us to prepare for the worst but, thankfully, she pulled through.’ Hannah can only tolerate three types of antibiotics and has food allergies so severe she has never even been able to go on a plane for fear that she could be exposed to an allergen in the plane’s atmosphere. She is dangerously allergic to fish, pulses, citrus fruit, pulses, peas, green beans and some antibiotics, among other things. Being exposed to even microscopic quantities of these items can cause her body to swell and makes it difficult for her to breathe. Her mother said: ‘I want to be able to get my baby the best possible treatment. Hannah (pictured with her mother, Karen, and sister, Grace) also has some very severe allergies. She is dangerously allergic to fish, peas, pulses, citrus fruits and some antibiotics . Hannah's family are raising money to enable her to have a special pump fitted which will supply her body with the cortisol it desperately needs. They hope it will enable her to live a more normal life . ‘It is a struggle for Hannah every day. It takes her about two hours in a morning just to get out of bed. ‘She struggles to walk great distances and it is hard because of her allergies to take her on holidays or out to restaurants. ‘You don't always know when she will get excited or stressed to monitor it because it is just something that happens.’ Her family are now raising funds so Hannah can be fitted with a hydrocortisone pump which would constantly supply the hormone she is missing. Mrs Bowness-Major said: ‘I am desperate for her to be the person that I know she can be. ‘She still makes top sets in her classes despite missing 50 per cent of her classes and tries her hardest to do what other pupils can, even if it hurts her. ‘She is such a thoughtful kid, and despite some of the horrendous times she has been through she has never once cried. ‘If I could wave a magic wand and make it better or take it away from her and have it myself I would.’ To support Hannah click here or follow 'Helping Hannah' on Facebook.","Hannah Bowness-Major, 13, has Addison's disease which means her adrenal gland does not produce enough of the vital hormone cortisol .

"Her best friend had just died of cancer and she had been in and out of hospital having painful surgery. So by the end of 2012, Tarryn Severn was feeling emotionally drained, rundown and unhealthy. The 25-year-old was eating badly, drinking too much and lacking self-confidence. Tarryn Severn dropped from 10st 7lbs (left) to 9st 2lbs (right) while taking part in a body makeover challenge . She also felt lethargic, she lacked energy and her immune system was struggling. So, Ms Severn, who lives in London, decided it was time to focus on improving her mental and physical health. Along with her boyfriend, Dominic Ball, she signed up for a Body Makeover Challenge. Run by the supplement company USN, the challenge saw the pair attempt to improve their health and lifestyles as much as possible in three months. Ms Severn, an Executive Assistant at Barclays, said: ‘I needed something to focus on physically and mentally. ‘I did it to get my health right because I hadn’t been looking after myself, and I needed to sort out my health. Her boyfriend, Dominic Ball, also took on the challenge and he dropped from 13st 3lbs (left) to 11st 6lbs (right) ‘I saw it not as a diet, but as a mental and physical lifestyle change.' Mr Ball added: 'I generally didn't feel good in myself, physically and mentally. 'My energy levels were always low and I could never concentrate for very long. 'It got to the point were I knew I had hit rock bottom. 'I had to make a change and I knew it needed to be a big one. My entire lifestyle needed a total overhaul. BEFORE: . Breakfast: Nothing . Lunch: A chicken and mayonnaise baguette followed by some chocolate . Dinner: Spaghetti carbonara . Drinks: A bottle of wine three or four evenings a week . AFTER: . Breakfast: Porridge . Mid-morning: Eggs with spinach . Lunch: Chicken stir fry . Mid-afternoon: Lean meat with vegetables . Dinner: A protein shake . Drinks: Water and coffee - very little alcohol . 'I was browsing through the internet and stumbled on the USN makeover challenge. 'It was exactly what I needed. I have always been a very competitive person and since this was a competition I thought that would help give me the added motivation to stick with it.' At the start of the challenge, in January 2013, Ms Severn weighed 10st 7lbs and was feeling lethargic and unhealthy as a result of drinking too much and eating too much stodgy food. She had stopped looking after herself properly because she had had an incredibly tough year. Her best friend, Ilona, had died of bowel cancer at the age of just 31 and she had suffered constant, crippling stomach pain as a result of severe endometriosis. Ms Severn, who is from Australia, had gone through surgery to treat her endometriosis and had even ended up back in hospital after developing complications related to the treatment. She was drinking a bottle of wine in a night three or four times a week and was eating unhealthily. She would skip breakfast, have a chicken and mayonnaise baguette and some chocolate for lunch followed by spaghetti carbonara for dinner. She told MailOnline: ‘I considered Ilona my sister – we just clicked when we first met and I am so glad that I met her. We were very, very close. ‘It is still very difficult – very raw. ‘I felt guilty because I was in England having surgery while she was very sick in Australia. I felt bad because I wasn’t at home with her.’ She added: ‘I ate really badly and I got ill a lot because my immune system was weak. The couple took on the challenge after realising they were not looking after themselves very well and that it was affecting their physical and mental health (they are pictured before) Ms Severn and Mr Ball say that since they revolutionised their diets (pictured) they feel more confident and healthier. Mr Ball says he is now less tired and Ms Severn says her hair and nails are better . ‘I didn’t feel good and so I would then eat more comfort food which just made it worse. ‘By the start of the new year in 2013 I knew I needed to sort out my bad habits and improve my health.’ Ms Severn signed up for the Body Makeover Challenge Competition and set about changing her life. She started to eat every three hours, instead of just having two big meals a day. She also gave up alcohol and started following a strict exercise and weights regime. Her diet was revolutionised when she started eating porridge for breakfast, eggs and spinach mid-morning and a chicken stir fry for lunch. Mid-afternoon she would eat some lean meat with vegetables, followed by a protein shake for dinner. After three months following this programme, she had lost 1st 5lbs to drop to 9st 2lbs. She said: ‘I don’t get sick so often now, I have more energy, I am not as lethargic and sleepy and I am a lot healthier. Ms Severn used to eat a lot of bread and pasta (left) but now focuses on lean meats and vegetables (right) ‘My skin and hair are better and my nails grow faster. ‘I am proud of what I accomplished and I am more confident and feel better in myself. ‘My life has changed dramatically.’ She says she now intends to stick to this new routine as it has changed her life for the better. She told MailOnline: ‘It has been really worth it. I really enjoyed doing it with my boyfriend – it brought us closer together and I was fun. ‘I needed it and I haven’t looked back.' Mr Ball also followed the programme with his girlfriend and he dropped from 13st 3lbs to 11st 6lbs. He said: 'I think doing the USN challenge was probably one of the best decisions I have ever made. 'Before I never used to like my body, I’m sure a lot of people can relate to that feeling. Mr Ball (pictured before the challenge) and Ms Severn both won their sections of the Body Makeover Challenge . 'Now I’m proud of it, I’ve swapped the beer gut for a ripped six pack. I never even thought that would be possible.' He added that his energy levels and sleep patterns have also improve as has his concentration. Amazingly, Ms Severn and Mr Ball both won their sections of the Body Makeover Challenge Competition – Ms Severn won the female section and Mr Ball the male one. Ms Severn said: ‘It is a life-long change – it has changed my life completely. ‘I have learned so much about what to eat and when. Before this I didn’t know any of this – it has been a great learning experience. ‘I 100 per cent intend to stick with it. I like eating healthily and I love my veggies now.' Mr Ball added: 'I was totally amazed at Tarryn’s transformation. 'She looks amazing and I can tell she has a lot more confidence in herself. 'She always used to have big body image issues, but after completing the USN challenge she had enough confidence to take part in a bikini competition and achieve second place.'","Tarryn Severn, 25, lost her best friend, Ilona, 31, to bowel cancer in 2012 .

"Despite countless Whitehall campaigns and initiatives, Britons still don’t really care about the environment, a survey has found. Nearly two thirds  admit to being indifferent, and one in ten young people claim not to care about recycling at all. A third of people thought they recycled as much as possible – but only one in six said they consciously bought items because they were made from recycled materials. Scroll down for video . According to research, the average UK home recycles only 250 of the 440 plastic bottles it uses every year . The survey of 1,000 people was carried out by Pledge4Plastics, the latest Government-backed initiative to tackle unnecessary use of landfill. It will undoubtedly worry bureaucrats tasked with getting Britain to hit EU targets of recycling half our waste by 2020. In September last year, England’s household recycling rate stood at 43.9 per cent – a decline from 44.1 per cent in 2012. And according to Pledge4Plastics, the average UK home uses 440 plastic bottles a year, but recycles just 250 of them. One in five people admit they don’t recycle fizzy drink or milk bottles, while a quarter don’t put juice or water bottles in the correct bin. Some 5billion plastic bottles were sent to UK landfill sites last year. The most recent figures from the EU statistics office reveal that Germany is the continent’s recycling leader at 65 per cent. Britain is on 43.9 per cent, while France recycles 39 per cent. Romania recycles just 1 per cent of household waste.","Only one in six bought items because they were made of recycled materials .

"A Texas student killed by a campus cop during a traffic stop last year was nearly twice the legal limit when the officer shot him five times, an autopsy has revealed. Cameron Redus, 23, had a blood alcohol level of .155 when he was stopped for driving erratically and killed by Corporal Christopher Carter outside his San Antonio apartment on December 6. Redus' family have said that despite their son's mistakes that night, the severity of these mistakes did not warrant the treatment he suffered at the hands of Carter. The autopsy, released Thursday, revealed all of the five shots fired by Carter were at close range. Killed: Cameron Redus, who was described by friends as not being aggressive, was shot five times at close range by a campus cop who had pulled him over for driving erratically last December . Details of the medical examiner's report, released to Kens5, showed the University of the Incarnate Wood student had gun shot wounds to his left eye, upper chest, back, left elbow and right hip. Confrontation: Corporal Chris Carter fired several times at the student . The shot to the back became lodged in Cameron's heart and was 'the most immediately lethal,' the medical examiner reported. A shot to the eye could also have been lethal, the report added. The student's family say he was never aggressive or confrontational but, according to Corporal Carter, Cameron tried to beat him with his own baton after he was pulled over for driving erratically. His parents, Mickey and Valerie Redus, and their other sons, released a statement saying they were 'devastated' by the autopsy findings. 'We are stunned to learn that Cameron was . shot in the back from very close range. The report also shows that the . shot to his eye was delivered at a downward angle, again from very close . range,' they wrote. 'That knowledge, coupled with information from the earlier police . report indicating that Cameron died on his back with his legs underneath . him, has left us heartbroken and shaken to the core.' The family added that they did not . condone his decision to drive while under the influence, but said they . were 'thankful' he arrived home safely without harming anyone else on . the night in question. They added: 'Cameron’s mistakes do not negate the . amazing and productive life he lived nor the loving, encouraging and . compassionate person that he was. 'While mistakes do bear consequences, . the extreme and brutal results of Cameron’s encounter with Officer . Carter far exceed the magnitude of his mistakes.' Fatal: An autopsy report shows Cameron was shot at close range and in the back . Crime scene: Police investigate the street outside Cameron's apartment, where he was shot dead . The . Incarnate Word student was in his final year at the San Antonio . university and had been celebrating the end of the fall semester with . friends when he was shot outside his apartment. In a press conference after the shooting, Chief . Richard Pruitt of the Alamo Heights Police Department, said Cameron had . wrestled Captain Carter's baton from him and hit the policeman in the . head and arm with it. Captain Carter eventually got the baton back and told Cameron four times to stop fighting him or he would shoot. That's . when the student allegedly turned around and charged at Captain Carter . with his arm raised to strike, and Captain Carter fired six shots, . hitting Cameron five times in the chest, neck, eye, arm and thigh. While . the camera on the police cruiser . was out, audio was still working which captured Captain Carter warning . the student 56 . times to stop resisting arrest, 14 times to place his hands behind his . back and three times that he was under arrest, the police claimed. Heartbroken: One of Cameron's brothers, and his father Mickey, at the vigil. The family were shocked by the contents of the autopsy . Doubts: Mickey Redus, pictured at his son's vigil, says he has doubts about the police account of the shooting . Shortly after his death, Cameron's parents said: 'Our family does not believe the . officer’s report ... For him to confront a police officer would be completely out of his character.' In the statement, reported in KVUE, the family said: 'We are grieved by the tragic and unnecessary death of our son Cameron.' Friends and professors of Cameron told his parents 'just how much they admired and respected Cameron and expected him to be a success in life'. Mr and Mrs Redus added: 'We expect all official reports to confirm that Cameron’s death was unnecessary and unjustified.' The . family said they knew their son would have been unarmed and added that . the police had searched his apartment and cleaned up the scene before . they arrived. Police are investigating the shooting but the family said they . questioned the campus officer's decision to follow an unknown person to . an off-campus apartment. 'Even if Cameron was driving erratically, . he presented no threat to the campus police officer or anyone else once . he parked his truck,' they said in the statement. Cameron had been celebrating the end of semester with friends before he was shot .

Seeing the attack, the coach's wife pulled out a gun and fired it into the air. At this point, according to Lt. James Espinoza, the coach managed to escape and ran to his car to get another gun. His assailants fled before officers arrived and confiscated both guns . Espinoza appealed for anyone with video footage of the incident to contact police. He also expressed concern that children at the practice saw the attack. 'They'll probably never forget that,' Espinoza said. 'It should be no part of the sport.'

"The United States last night demanded an urgent investigation into allegations that the  Syrian government used poison gas on opposition fighters. Washington claimed it has proof that a toxic chemical, thought to be chlorine, was used earlier this month in a helicopter attack on a rebel stronghold in the town of Kfar Zeita. A US State Department spokesman said: 'We are examining allegations that the government was responsible. Obviously there needs to be an investigation of what's happened here.' Scroll down for video . French President Francois Hollande  and French Foreign Affairs minister Laurent Fabius welcome French journalists Edouard Elias and Didier Francois taken hostage in Syria last year and freed on Saturday.

US Secretary of State John Kerry was . briefing President Barack Obama on the disturbing development last night . amid speculation that, if substantiated, the chemical use could spur . tougher action against president Bashar al-Assad's embattled regime. The . US statement came hours after French president Francois Hollande . accused Syria of carrying out chlorine gas attacks. He said that Western . officials had found 'credible evidence' of the gas being used in at . least three locations this month. 'What . we have seen from this regime is the horrific methods it is capable of . using and the rejection of any political transition,' Mr Hollande added. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad marked Easter by visiting a Christian town near Damascus recently recaptured by his forces, state media reported. The claims come days ahead of an April 27 deadline for Assad's government to have handed over Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles for destruction . Syrian opposition activists said helicopters dropped chlorine gas on Kfar Zeita on April 11 and 12. With . the US confirming 'indications' of a chemical drop, it appears the .

"An epileptic boy who had 300 fits a day has had his life transformed by a high fat diet. Six-year-old Charlie Smith from Epsom, Surrey, would lose consciousness when he had an attack. The youngster was taking a cocktail of drugs to control his severe seizures, but they left him drowsy and had little effect. Charlie Smith is epileptic and had up to 300 fits a day until he started following a high fat, low carbohydrate diet . His desperate family were running out of options. So, when a neurologist suggested the family try a radical diet overhaul, Charlie's parents, Debbie and Wayne, felt they had nothing to lose. Within three weeks of putting Charlie on a high fat, low carbohydrate ketogenic diet, Charlie had stopped having seizures completely. His parents have also managed to wean him off his anti-seizure drugs completely. The ketogenic diet works by changing the fuel the body uses. The . diet forces the body to burn fats, instead of glucose from . carbohydrates, putting it into a state of ketosis, which appears to . reduce seizures, although it remains unclear how this works. While Charlie was struggling to eat any . meals before the diet due to his severe seizures, he now clears his . plate and loves butter so much he will eat it by the spoonful when he . gets the chance. He also gorges on fatty foods such as cheese and cream. Charlie (pictured with his parents, Debbie and Wayne) has not had a fit since his started following the diet . Charlie had his first epileptic fit when he was two and medication was unable to control his seizures . Mrs Smith, . 47, said: ‘The diet has changed our lives for the better. As soon as . Charlie switched to it, it was as if a cloud had been lifted. ‘We were at our wit’s end and just were just praying for a miracle. I was nervous about whether the diet would work. ‘Charlie's fits were horrific, and as parents we were constantly worrying about him. She added: ‘His first seizure was completely out the blue. He had no previous health problems, but stopped breathing one day. The ketogenic diet is a treatment option for epileptic children who do not respond to medication. It has been shown to reduce the number or severity of seizures, as well as to have positive effects on behaviour in some children. The diet is high fat and low carbohydrate. Usually the body uses glucose from carbohydrates for fuel but the diet forces the body to use ketones - made when the body burns fat for energy - instead of glucose for its energy. It does this by depriving the body of carbohydrates. Most often the ketogenic diet involves consuming a lot of fat from cream, butter and oil. It is not suitable for all children with epilepsy but can help those with Dravet syndrome and West syndrome. To make sure the diet is nutritionally balanced, a dietitian has to work out exactly how much of which foods a child needs to eat each day. A Great Ormond Street Hospital study suggested the diet helps about 40 per cent of children who have not responded to medication. Source: Epilepsy Society . ‘He was rushed to hospital and we were absolutely terrified.’ After . Charlie's first seizure at the age of two, they gradually got worse . until the little boy was having 300 seizures a day, and drugs were . failing to help him. The family endured two years of torment trying to find a solution to Charlie's health problems, while also looking after their three other children Joe, 11, Jack, 12, and Lauren, 14. The family were put in touch with charity Matthew's Friends, who specialise in helping families and children who are embarking on the ketogenic diet. Charlie's mother said: ‘Matthew's Friends have been fantastic and really opened our eyes to the wonders of the diet. ‘They helped us work out exactly what Charlie could eat, and what portion sizes he needed.’ ‘He loves the meals on the diet and knows how important it is to stick to them. ‘Charlie has definitely developed a taste for butter- he can't get enough of it and will eat it with a spoon if he can.’ It is important Charlie sticks to the high fat diet as it been carefully calculated to ensure he is nourished but also keep his seizures at bay. Charlie's father, 48-year-old Mr Smith, who works in the film industry, said: ‘We were nervous about Charlie relying on the diet alone to keep him seizure free, so weaning him off was a slow process, but since he was drug free it has been fantastic. Charlie stopped having fits within three weeks of a doctor suggesting his parents put him on the ketogenic diet. He is pictured with parents, Debbie and Wayne, sister, Lauren, and brothers, Jack and Joe . ‘Charlie has his life back, and hasn't had an attack since he started the diet, two years ago. It is a miracle and we couldn't be happier.’ As part of his diet, Charlie will have butter with every meal and has at least 12g with his breakfast, which is usually a cheese omelette, made with butter, oil, mushrooms, eggs and cheese. Lunch comprises more high fat foods, including cheese and mayonnaise pitta bread, with yet more butter, and fruit. And for dinner he will have a high fat version of his family meals, which include lashings of extra butter on top of any meal. His mother carefully measures the ingredients in Charlie's diet and he also takes additional vitamins to make sure he is fully nourished. Charlie's mother carefully weighs his food and he follows a strict diet plan to ensure he is well nourished as well as following the ketogenic diet closely to prevent his seizures . Mrs Smith said: ‘In the beginning it took a bit of planning and preparing but now we have worked out recipes for buttery foods which Charlie enjoys.’ Founder of Matthew's Friends, 46-year-old Emma Williams, MBE, started the charity after her own son, Matthew, dramatically reduced his seizures after starting the diet. Ms Williams said: ‘To see the turnaround in Charlie is phenomenal for him and his family. ‘Before he started on the diet, he was suffering these horrendous seizures which may have worsened until Charlie had no quality of life. ‘He is a phenomenal little boy who is now catching up and school and living his life - he is completely drug and seizure free and this is why we do it - to help children and families.’","Charlie Smith is epileptic and used to have hundreds of debilitating seizures .

"Tiger Woods once said that the champions of golf are measured by their performances in the majors but there is something that even separates men like Woods from the rest. It is something that divides the greatest from the great, and something that we have witnessed here at Hoylake this week in the form of Rory McIlroy. Sergio Garcia had said there is no real weakness in his game and so it proved on the lush fairways of Royal Liverpool, McIlroy withstanding what amounted to a serious attack from the Spaniard with a measured, impressively mature performance. VIDEO Scroll down for highlights . Proud moment: Rory Mcilroy lifts the claret jug after winning the 2014 Open Championship at Royal Liverpool . Eyes on the ball: McIlroy was in control at the Open and has been blessed with few powers athletes possess . There were anxious moments, of course. The bogeys on five and six. Not to mention the dreadful tee shot on 13 that enabled Garcia to close to within two shots of the Northern Irishman. But never did he allow Garcia to move any closer. Never, even when Garcia was tearing up this golf course prior to his own mistake in the bunker at 15, did he relinquish control. McIlroy was in control from the gun to the tape over four mesmerising days, taking command of the 143rd Open Championship with a magnificent demonstration of his ability. He has been blessed with powers few athletes possess. A degree of talent that, when harnessed, makes him simply untouchable; completely unplayable; a class apart. Family affair: McIlroy was joined by his mum Rosie and dad Gerry after claiming victory on the Wirral . VIDEO The Open Championship: Final Round . At times, and certainly over the first three days, it was like watching Usain Bolt in full stride, Roger Federer at full stretch, Michael Schumacher at full throttle. Happy chappy: The new open champion poes with the famous Claret Jug . It was Lionel Messi when he had Arsene Wenger comparing him to a Playstation figure, or Cristiano Ronaldo when a moment’s improvisation produced a moment as magical as that mule kick against Valencia. There was a moment on Sunday afternoon when Garcia dared to dream. When an eagle at the tenth was followed by an exchange of looks between player and caddie that said, ‘hey, we might just have a chance here’. But Garcia will also reflect on this tournament and remember why, on Saturday night, he compared McIlroy to Woods at his indomitable best, and perhaps accept that he was always coming from too far back to snatch what would have been his first major. So glorious was McIlroy he actually left the rest of the field feeling they were competing for second place in a way that only the finest athletes on the planet do. A few hours before delivering what Lord Coe considered the performance of the London Olympics, David Rudisha offered Timothy Kitum a few words of advice. Rudisha informed his fellow Kenyan of his intention to become the first man to cover two laps of the athletics track in less than a minute and 41 seconds that night and suggested it would be unwise to follow him if he wanted to win a medal. Write caption here . At 25 years and two months, Rory McIlroy is the youngest Open champion since Tiger Woods in 2000. Woods won it aged 24 years 6 months . Kitum listened, let Rudisha dominate the 800m final from the gun and in the last straight picked off those foolish enough to chase the world record holder to take bronze. When Federer was at his peak, winning the Australian Open in 2007 without dropping a set and losing only one set en route to securing the third of his seven Wimbledon titles in 2005, the best his rivals could realistically hope for was the prize money for the runner-up. To the brand of tennis he was able to produce, a beautiful yet devastating combination of finesse and power, they had no answer. Armed with a golf club McIlroy also combines that finesse and power, striking the ball not just with perfect timing but with the kind of precision that nobody else could match with such consistency here on The Wirral. It was a privilege to watch. To see those drives on the fifth on Thursday and the 17th on Friday, the second of which was just shy of 400 yards. McIlroy pointed out afterwards that Dustin Johnson had driven the ball even further on that particular fairway, ignoring the fact that Johnson is near enough a foot taller than him and built like a basketball player. Winning combination: McIlroy's father Gerry banked £50,000 after Rory won The Open this year . Distance, however, is not the only determining factor. Accuracy and control are vital components too, as McIlroy demonstrated on Saturday with eagles at 16 and 18 that also emphasised the importance of timing of a different kind. The timing of an attack, that one coming just as Rickie Fowler and Garcia were dropping shots. This is why McIlroy has become the first European golfer to win three different majors and why it felt last night like there will be plenty more to come. Beyond even a career Grand Slam. Those close to him certainly see a 25-year-old now coming of age, just as they see significance in that recent meeting with Jack Nicklaus. Perhaps the guidance he took from the greatest golfer of all amounted to the final piece of the jigsaw in creating the champion now in possession of the Claret Jug. All week he has oozed confidence, even when there was talk of his ‘freaky Friday’ problem after that opening 66. That afternoon in the media tent he was completely unfazed; not the slightest bit rattled. It is how the greatest of the greats are, whether they are on a football pitch, a running track, a tennis court or a golf course. They are different. Indeed, after one game at the World Cup, Messi was said to be ‘from Jupiter’. The same could be said of McIlroy. He already has a home there after all.","Rory McIlroy triumphed at Royal Liverpool to claim three of the four golf majors .

"A helicopter rescue worker arrested on suspicion of stealing Michael Schumacher's medical notes has been found hanged in his police cell, prosecutors said. The suspect was found dead today around 24 hours after he was held by officers investigating the theft and leaking of the confidential file. The man, who has not been identified, worked for Swiss helicopter rescue firm Rega, which organised the Formula One champion's transport from a French hospital to a unit in Switzerland in June, the Zurich prosecutor's office said in a statement. Scroll down for video . A helicopter rescue worker has hanged himself in his cell a day after being arrested on suspicion of stealing a medical file on Michael Schumacher (above) who was in a coma for six months after a skiing accident . Schumacher, 45, suffered a major head . injury when he fell while skiing in France in December and was kept in a . medically induced coma for six months after the accident. He was recently transferred from the hospital in Grenoble, France, to a unit near his Swiss home, allowing his wife Corinna to attend a public event at her ranch in Givrins. The records are believed to consist of several pages of medical notes outlining the extent of the injury suffered by Schumacher. Earlier this year, his manager Sabine Kehm revealed the documents had been 'clearly stolen' and warning that anyone buying or publishing the 'confidential files' would be prosecuted. It is understood the notes were offered for sale across Europe to media organisations for £50,000. The man worked for Swiss helicopter rescue company Rega (seen in a file picture above) which organised the sportsman's transport from a French hospital to Switzerland in June . Last month, a Swiss newspaper claimed Schumacher was making such good progress in the Lausanne rehab clinic he may be home before the end of the summer. Schumacher woke up from his medically induced coma last month after smashing his head on rocks while skiing on December 29 in the French Alps. It is understood that he remains paralysed and communicates with his wife and children Gina-Maria, 17, and son Mick, 15, by fluttering his eyes. Doctors at the Lausanne clinic hope to have Michael sitting upright in an advanced electronic wheelchair that he can control via his mouth within a few weeks.","Suspect found dead a day after he was arrested over the alleged theft .

"One hundred years ago today, 21-year-old Edward 'Ryko' Reichenbach, arrived at the old Darwin Post Office, having cycled 3,000km across the desert from the post office in Adelaide. Ryko, a keen cyclist and photographer, broke the record for the fastest person to cycle form Adelaide to Darwin, completing the journey in just 28 days. The Northern Territory Library, which is on the site of the old post office, where Ryko completed his journey, is marking the centenary of the occasion with an exhibition of some of the photographs Ryko took during his journey. Ryko is pictured riding his bike through a 'gauntlet of spears', though it is believed the picture was posed and he had a good relationship with local indigenous people. The caption on this picture reads 'Arnheim Land cycling episode - overcome by the Myalls. Running the gauntlet of spears' Ryko rode his modified bike from Adelaide to Darwin and spent the next few years travelling around the Northern Territory photographing the landscape . The adventurous young man embarked on the 3,000km journey with a friend, John Fahey, but just before crossing the border from South Australia into the Northern Territory, Mr Fahey sprained his ankle and was forced to stop and rest, leaving Ryko to continue the journey alone. A keen photographer, Ryko took a Koadak camera with him and used the trip to photograph some of Australia's most remote sites. After arriving in Darwin, Ryko opened a shop where he sold prints of his photographs for four pence each, developing the photos in a stuidio out the back. But in December 1915 he sold the business and resumed his nomadic lifestyle, travelling across the Northern Territory, taking photographs as he went. Ted Ryko is pictured here carrying his bicycle through a swamp in the Norther Territory. In 1914, he set the record for cycling to Darwin from Adelaide, completing the 3,000km trip in just 28 days . Today marks the 100th anniversary of his bike ride and his family have celebrated by recreating the final leg of the journey, with his 68-year-old granddaughter riding from Tennant Creek to Darwin . This picture  shows Indigenous people carrying Ryko and his bicycle through the Northern Territory. The caption reads: 'Arnheim Land cycling episode - carried to safety' He often visited the Mary and Alligator Rivers, near Kakadu, to photograph the buffalo shooting camps, and returned to Darwin every few months to develop, print and sell his work. During the First World War the Northern Territory government suspected Tyko of being a German spy, due to his German heritage – though he was Australian-born – and because of his travelling and photography. His name was cleared, but by 1917 he had already left the Northern Territory. Ryko moved to Sydney, but his flat was robbed and his collection of photographs, from which he derived his income, was stolen. The collection has never resurfaced and the only photographs of his that are currently publicly available come from the prints he sold that survived in private collections, museums, archives and libraries. Ryko poses with three snakes around his neck as part of his series on Northern Territory travels . His trusty bike: Ryko's granddaughter Michele Adler had a replica of her grandfather's bike made and rode it on the final leg of the journey into Darwin today .

"Murder suspect Shrien Dewani will stand trial in October for plotting to kill his new bride after a panel of psychiatric experts ruled that he was mentally fit. The 34-year-old businessman, who denies any involvement, lost a lengthy battle against extradition to South Africa in April after claiming to be too traumatised and depressed to face justice. But mental health experts in the country unanimously agreed Dewani was well enough to be tried for wife Anni’s abduction and murder during their honeymoon in 2010 after observing him for 30 days.

"The number of people being poisoned by e-cigarettes has soared in the last few years, according to an official report. The number of calls to poison centres in the U.S. relating to the liquids in e-cigarettes has risen from one per month in September 2010, to 215 per month in February 2014. The figures, from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, also show that the number of calls per month relating to conventional cigarettes did not increase in the same way. Scroll down for video . The number of people being poisoned by e-cigarettes has rocketed in the last four years, figures show . The CDC statistics show that more than half of the calls relate to children under the age of five. However, some 42 per cent are related to adults over the age of 20. As e-cigarettes become more popular, they are linked to more poisoning cases. The analysis compared total monthly poison centre calls involving e-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes, and found the proportion of e-cigarette calls jumped from 0.3 per cent in September 2010 to 41.7 per cent in February 2014. Poisoning from conventional cigarettes is generally due to young children eating them. Poisoning related to e-cigarettes involves the liquid containing nicotine used in the devices. It can occur in three ways - by ingestion, inhalation or absorption through the skin or eyes. ‘This report raises another red flag about e-cigarettes – the liquid nicotine used in e-cigarettes can be hazardous,’ said CDC Director Tom Frieden. E-cigarettes are now responsible for 42 per cent of all poisoning cases related to cigarettes . ‘Use of these products is skyrocketing and these poisonings will continue. ‘E-cigarette liquids as currently sold are a threat to small children because they are not required to be childproof, and they come in candy and fruit flavours that are appealing to children.’ E-cigarette calls were more likely than cigarette calls to include a report of an adverse health effect following exposure. The most common adverse health effects mentioned in e-cigarette calls were vomiting, nausea and eye irritation. The data for the study came from the poison centres that serve the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Territories. Poison centres reported 2,405 e-cigarette and 16,248 cigarette exposure calls from September 2010 to February 2014. The total number of poisoning cases is likely higher than reflected in this study, because not all exposures might have been reported to poison centres. ‘The most recent National Youth Tobacco Survey showed e-cigarette use is growing fast, and now this report shows e-cigarette related poisonings are also increasing rapidly,’ said Tim McAfee, Director of CDC’s Office on Smoking and Health. ‘Health care providers, e-cigarette companies and distributors, and the general public need to be aware of this potential health risk from e-cigarettes.’ The news comes just days after it was announced that the Welsh government will consider including e-cigarettes under the smoking ban. Ministers say they might ban smoking the electronic devices inside because they could glamourize smoking and act as a gateway to normal cigarettes. Currently, there are no plans to ban them in England, but the chief medical officer has raised concerns about their safety. Earlier this week it was announced that the Welsh government is considering extending the smoking ban to include e-cigarettes. This would mean people were not allowed to smoke the electronic devices inside. Ministers say they have made the proposal because they fear e-cigarettes could glamourize smoking and act as a gateway to normal cigarettes. Mark Drakeford, health minister in the Labour-run Welsh government, said people have spent 30 years creating a climate in which people understand smoking is not glamorous but he is concerned e-cigarettes could undo that good work. There are currently no plans to ban them in England but the chief medical officer has raised concerns about their safety. Dame Sally Davies said: 'We are normalising e-cigarettes. If they were regulated as a medicine and we knew what was in them and the dose of nicotine, then they might play a useful role in stopping smoking. But they aren't, so at the moment we don't know their safety or the dose they deliver. 'Flavourings are often attractive to children – cookies and cream and bubblegum. 'They are sold rather cheaply and many are made in China, so I worry about what's in them. 'I am also worried about once again making smoking seem like a normal activity.'","More than half of poisoning cases were in children under five .

"A choirmaster who had been in a coma for 10 days has recalled the remarkable moment he woke up - after his wife played a recording of his own singers in action. Barry Todd even began whistling along as the choir performed Give a Little Whistle, from the Disney classic Pinocchio. The 64-year-old father-of-two said: 'Music has always been my life - and now it has saved it.' Choirmaster Barry Todd was brought out of a coma by his wife, Carol, playing a recording of his singers . Mr Todd was lucky to survive a ruptured aortic aneurysm and had been unconscious for ten days. He said: ‘I was a very active person, it happened totally out of the blue. I very nearly died. ‘I had been unconscious for about a . week-and-a-half but they say hearing is the last thing to go. 'Music . stimulates the brain and it could well have been that it helped me come . out of it.' He added: 'My wife played music and I began to join in and whistle. ‘I was only semi-conscious. I don’t think I even realised I was doing it. Mr Todd nearly died when he suffered a ruptured aortic anuerysm. He spent 10 days in a coma (pictured) Mr Todd (pictured facing away with his choir, the Midland Voices) started whistling along when he was played the recording of a Pinocchio song even though he was only semi-conscious . Mr Todd, from Solihull, collapsed last October with severe back pain after suffering a ruptured aortic aneurysm. An aortic aneurysm is a bulge in the blood vessel known as the aorta and it occurs as a result of a weakness in the blood vessel's wall. As blood passes through the weakened blood vessel, the pressure causes it to bulge outwards like a balloon. Occasionally, this bulge can rupture causing dangerous internal bleeding. An aortic aneurysm is a bulge in the major blood vessel known as the aorta. It occurs as a result of a weakness in the blood vessel's wall. As blood passes through the weakened blood vessel, the pressure causes it to bulge outwards like a balloon. Occasionally, this bulge can rupture causing dangerous internal bleeding. As . the aorta is so large, most people who experience a ruptured aortic . aneurysm die rapidly, but some can be saved with emergency surgery. Those . that survive the initial rupture, are at risk of complications . including kidney problems, organ failure and respiratory problems. Aortic aneurysms are most common in men over the age of 65. People are at greater risk if they smoke, are overweight and eat a high fat diet. As the aorta is so large, most people who experience a ruptured aortic aneurysm die rapidly, but some can be saved with emergency surgery. Those that survive the initial rupture are at risk of complications including kidney problems, organ failure and respiratory problems. Mrs Todd, 53, who has three grown-up children from a previous marriage, said: 'Barry had woken in the night complaining of excruciating back pain. 'In the morning it hadn't got any better so I called the paramedics. 'They came and said it might be kidney stones so he was taken to hospital by ambulance. 'I followed in the car behind because I thought he would be discharged soon but he didn't even get out of the ambulance. 'He was taken straight to Coventry hospital and rushed into theatre. 'The doctors told me to get the family together and prepare for the worst. They even asked us if we wanted a priest to come in to read Barry his last rites. 'We were devastated. For days he just lay in a coma and we did everything we could to stay positive. I played him the choir's CDs for hours and sang to him as well. 'Something inside me made me sure that if anything was going to get him out of his coma it would be music. 'Music . has been such a huge part of his life and we are just delighted he woke . up. He has a long way to go but he's alive and that's the most . important thing. It's a miracle.' Mr Todd needed 12 operations as he recovered at Coventry’s University Hospital. Doctors were also forced to amputate his left leg after he developed a blood clot and also had to remove most of his bowel. After suffering the ruptured aneurysm, Mr Todd developed a blood clot and his leg had to be amputated . However, he hopes to be able to stand and conduct one of Midland Voices’ three choirs at a concert later this month. ‘To be able to rehearse the choir is uplifting,’ Mr Todd said. ‘The music really helps the healing process.’ Mr Todd has spent his career in the entertainment business after studying the piano and trumpet at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, in London. He founded Midland Voices five years ago and its choirs rehearse at venues across Warwickshire. Mrs Todd, who was forced to give up work as a music teacher to care for her husband, said: 'The choir have been wonderful. 'The managers of the concert venue where they perform have built a ramp for Barry and he will conduct the singers and orchestra from his wheelchair. 'He is so determined, music is his life.'","Barry Todd, 64, was luck to survive a ruptured aortic aneurysm in October .

"HIV could be cured by genetically editing stem cells, researchers believe. U.S. scientists say they have already demonstrated that it is possible to alter the genetic material of some stem cells. This in turn provides HIV resistance, they report. A new 'genome editing' technique could be the key to curing HIV. Image shows HIV in human tissue . The researchers, at the University of California, San Francisco, have found a way of removing one DNA sequence and replacing it with a different one, a technique known as ‘genome editing’, New Scientist reports. In this case, they replaced it with a rare DNA sequence that gives some people natural HIV resistance. This DNA sequence comes from people who have two copies of a mutation in a gene linked to the protein CCR5. HIV attaches to CCR5 when attempting to invade a person’s white blood cells. In people with the gene mutation, HIV is unable to attach to this protein meaning the person cannot become HIV positive. Only about one per cent of European people have two copies of the gene mutation. The technique involves removing a DNA sequence from a stem cell and replacing it with another, HIV-resistant one . The idea behind the research was the treatment of the so-called Berlin patient. Timothy Ray Brown was ‘cured’ of HIV after receiving a bone marrow transplant from a person who was resistant to the virus. This is not a practical way of curing patients as there are hardly any HIV-resistant bone marrow donors. So, the University of California researchers attempted to achieve the same thing but without a bone marrow donor. They say it is quite easy to make the necessary stem cells from a patient’s own cells and that these stem cells – which can be used to create white blood cells – can then be genetically edited to offer HIV-resistance. These edited stem cells could then be transplanted into patients causing them to develop HIV-resistance. It is hoped this technique could eventually offer a personalised equivalent of the treatment Mr Brown received. The researchers accept, however, that they are a long way from being able to use the technique in practice. To date, they have only got so far as to prove it is possible to edit the genome to produce white blood cells that are HIV-resistant. Currently 98,400 people in the UK are HIV positive, according to data from Public Health England. The most affected group are gay men, followed by black African men and women. One of the key difficulties in preventing the spread of HIV is that about one in five people who are HIV positive do not know this is the case.","It's possible to alter genetic material of stem cells to provide HIV resistance .

"Patients could one day 'grow' new organs from their own stem cells to replace failing body parts, a leading transplant surgeon says. It could offer a solution to the donor shortage crisis in the UK, which will only get worse as the population ages. Professor Paolo Macchiarini after performing the pioneering surgery at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona in 2008 . At least 1,000 Britons die each year while waiting for a new heart, . kidney or liver, while others are forced to pay for black market organs . bought in other countries. Professor Paolo Macchiarini who performed the first transplant of an organ grown from the patient's own cells in 2008, said scientists were now on the verge of using regenerative medicine to treat a far wider range of conditions. The pioneering technique involves inserting a patient's own stem cells into an artificial scaffold. It requires no human donors and as there are no problems with organ rejection patients will not need to spend a lifetime taking immuno-suppressive drugs. Explaining Claudia Castillo's treatment . Writing in The Lancet, Prof Macchiarini from the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm,  said: 'Such . an approach has already been used successfully for the repair and . reconstruction of several complex tissues such as the trachea, . oesophagus, and skeletal muscle in animal models and human beings. 'Guided . by appropriate scientific and ethical oversight, (this) could serve as a . platform for the engineering of whole organs and other tissues, and . might become a viable and practical future therapeutic approach to meet . demand after organ failure.' Prof Macchiarini said patients involved in early clinical trials should only be chosen if they have social support and are willing to cope with media interest. In 2008, 30-year-old Claudia Castillo hit the headlines after becoming the first person in the world to have a trachea transplant grown from her own cells. She had contracted TB which had damaged her windpipe leaving her breathless. Prof Macchiarini, leading a team from Barcelona University, stripped a donor trachea of its living cells and reseeded it with Claudia's cells before transplanting it. Claudia Castillo was the first recipient of an airway grown using her own cells . In 2010, he led a British team at Great Ormond Street Hospital to perform a similar operation on a 10-year-old boy born with a narrow windpipe. The trachea is a simple organ compared to a pair of lungs or the heart, however lung tissue has already been developed and transplant into mice. However, Prof Macchiarini said more needs to be done to address ethical questions raised by the new technology before it goes any further. 'The pressure to advance this technique, driven by . demand, the race for prestige, and the potential for huge profits, . mandates an early commitment be made to establish the safety of various . strategies… particularly when there are so many potential patients and . doctors who are desperate for any remedy that offers hope,' he said. He called for policies to address issues including transparency about the techniques involved and costs to patients.","At least 1,000 Britons die each year while waiting for a new heart, .

"Workers in the U.S. are more likely to develop depression after losing their jobs than those in Europe. A new study has revealed job loss is associated with depressive symptoms both sides of the Atlantic. But the effects are much stronger in America - perhaps due to less generous benefits systems, it has been suggested. U.S. workers suffer more depression after losing their jobs than European ones do, research suggests . The Harvard study discusses how the 'Great Recession' of 2008 caused significant job losses in both Europe and the U.S., with particularly strong consequences for older workers. Among people aged 50 to 64, unemployment rates rose from 3.1 per cent to 7.3 per cent in the U.S., and from 5.4 per cent to 6.15 per cent in the EU. The researchers speculate that iIncome loss may have particularly devastating consequences for the retirement plans of older workers. Prior evidence has also suggested job loss among older workers is associated with poorer health, increased substance abuse, and increased depression risk, they add. The study, led by Carlos Riumallo-Herl and published in the International Journal of Epidemiology, is the first to compare how these associations differ across countries. The researchers used data on 38,356 people from the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) and the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) covering the years 2004 to 2010. The findings could reflect the more generous benefits systems in Europe . Surveys were carried out via questionnaire face-to-face in Europe and over the phone in the U.S., and covered 13 European countries – including Spain, France and Italy - and the USA. At each interview, individuals were classified into four broad categories – employed, unemployed and looking for work, retired, or disabled. The reasons for job loss were also gathered - due to the worker's firm or plant closing down, due to redundancy, or job loss for another reason. And the individuals’ levels of depression were also recorded. The results showed overall job loss was associated with a 4.8 per cent increase in depression scores in the U.S., and a 3.4 per cent increase in Europe. However, when job loss due to plant closure was looked at separately, depressive symptom scores increased by 28.2 per cent in the U.S. as compared to 7.5 per cent in Europe. The role of wealth also differed across the two regions. Dr Riumallo-Herl said: ‘In the USA, the impact of job loss is significantly stronger for those with little or no wealth than for wealthier individuals and the impact of job loss due to plant closure was stronger than in Europe. ‘In contrast, we observed significant but weaker effects of job loss on depressive symptoms in Europe, which were not modified by pre-existing levels of wealth.’ The researchers suggest the results could reflect the more generous benefits systems in Europe.","Job loss linked to 4.8% rise in depression in U.S., and 3.4% rise in Europe .
When job loss is due to plant closure depression increases 28% in the U.S.
In this situation, depression scores increase by 7.5% in Europe .

The state-run airline is often criticized over allegations of corruption and flying old planes. Last year, the European Union banned all Nepalese airlines from flying to Europe because of poor safety records. The plane had 15 passengers and three crew members. One passenger was Danish, according to the Danish Foreign Ministry, while the rest were Nepalese. The age of the passenger with the infant ticket was not given. The plane's charred wreckage was flung across a wide area, said police official Bam Bahadur Bhandari. Some victims were identified using documents found in the wreckage, he said. Nepalese policemen receive the dead bodies of plane crash victims at the Teaching hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal . A helicopter was able to spot the wreckage earlier Monday near Machinelek, about 250 kilometers (160 miles) west of the capital, Katmandu, but they only way to access the remote location was on foot. The bodies were first picked up using ropes and nets by a smaller helicopter and then taken to a cleared area. They were then moved to a bigger army helicopter and flown to the capital, Katmandu. Doctors at the Tribhuwan University Teaching Hospital were performing autopsies before releasing the remains. Police and soldiers were trying to dig a temporary helipad for rescue helicopters. The cockpit voice recorder was also recovered from the crash site, the air rescue office in Katmandu said. The plane was flying from Katmandu to Jumla, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) to the west, when it made an unscheduled fuel stop in the city of Pokhara, about a third of the way into the journey.

"A ‘sacred' path that may have led to a 6,000-year-old henge has been discovered on a building site in Kent. The ceremonial gathering place in Iwade measures 98ft (30 metres) in diameter and is formed of a pair of ring ditches. Evidence suggests the outer ditch may have originated in the Neolithic period, and been later transformed in the Bronze Age into a funerary monument, with the addition of the inner ring. Scroll down for video . The ring of ditches (pictured) is believed to have been a henge, or ceremonial gathering place, and has a diameter of 98ft (30 metres). Archaeologists believe the outer ring dates to the Neolithic period, but was later transformed into a Bronze Age funerary monument . A henge is a circular or oval-shaped area enclosed, typically a ditch with an external bank. Henges have either a single ditch, or a pair of concentric ditches surrounding a central area. However, some henges have been known to have no ditch, while others have three. Access to the central area was through formal entrances and the majority of henges have either one entrance or two opposed entrances. The original purpose and function of henge monuments is not known, but they are commonly thought to have been  ceremonial or ritual monuments. However, further analysis is needed to determine the exact date, phasing and character of these two monuments. The discovery was made by Dr Paul Wilkinson and his team from Swat Archaeology. It is part of a larger, ongoing investigation on the site, ahead of development by Persimmon Homes at Iwade Meadows just to the west of Sittingbourne in Kent. The rings are positioned on the north-west slope above the Ridham Fleet stream that runs through the centre of the site. The outer ring has an entrance facing north-east, which suggests it may have originated as a henge-type monument, similar to Stonehenge. The inner ring appears to have been built later, and is an unbroken circuit. The researchers claim this may be associated with a Bronze Age burial mound, known as a barrow, although no bodies have been found. A second smaller monument lies close to the larger rings, and experts believe it may have been a secondary barrow, also dating to the Bronze Age. While the monuments may have fallen out of use for their primary function by the middle Bronze Age, Swat archaeology believe they would have still been significant landscape features.

In particular, they believe a track from the north east was extended to the causeway entrance of the outer ring. Its purpose is not known, but the experts claim it may have been formally used as a ‘sacred way’ leading to the Neolithic henge. ‘The importance of the location in the Neolithic is bolstered by the rare findings of a series of pits close to the monuments that may indicate the area was being used before the construction of the monument or represents activity associated with it,’ said Dr Paul Wilkinson, from Swat Archaeology. ‘The investigation of the monuments is almost complete and the numerous finds and records of the investigation will be analysed to reveal more clues about these prehistoric monuments and their surrounding landscape,’ continued Dr Wilkinson.

"Background noise from the TV is a common sound in many households, but a new study suggests it might damage more than just the electricity bill. U.S. researchers have found that the drone of a TV can adversely affect toddlers’ language development. They say it has long been known children develop their language skills from listening to their parents - and parents speak to their children less when the TV is on. Previous research has found that leaving the TV on in the background could harm a toddler's language development . For the study, published in the Journal of Children and Media, parents of toddlers aged 12, 24, and 36 months were observed interacting with their children while they played. They were observed for an hour and for half of that time the TV was on in the background. The researchers noted that while the TV was on, the quantity of words and phrases, as well as the number of new words spoken by the parents, was lower than when the TV was off. Given that the language used by parents is so intrinsically linked with child language development, the results of the study suggest that prolonged exposure to background TV has a negative influence. Children learn language skills from listening to their parents and their parents talk to them less if the TV is on . And in light of recent findings that children in the U.S. under 24 months watch an average 5.5 hours of background TV per day, the effect may be substantial. Author of the study, Tiffany Pempek, said: ‘Our new results, along with past research finding negative effects of background TV on young children's play and parent-child interaction, provide evidence that adult-directed TV content should be avoided for infants and toddlers whenever possible. ‘Although it is impractical and probably not desirable for parents to play with their young child all of the time, children do benefit greatly from active involvement by parents during play. ‘Ideally, parents should play with their child without the distraction of TV in the background.’ The American Academy of Pediatrics recently upheld their recommendation children under two years of age should not spend any time watching TV. While previously the guidelines focused on foreground media exposure, recent reports have noted the potential harm of background exposure as well, a form of TV exposure which parents may not be aware has any effect on their child at all.","Children learn to speak from listening to their parents talking to them .

"Beleaguered NSW Liberal MPs Tim Owen and Dr Andrew Cornwell have resigned from parliament as of this afternoon.

Mr Owen told ICAC on Monday that either his campaign manager Hugh Thomson or former NSW police minister Mike Gallacher arranged the December 2010 deal. But in sensational evidence today at the hearing into Liberal Party funding and breaches of the electoral donation funding act in Sydney, he said the money was never given back but 'rolled into (his) campaign'.

"Britain's tax system is a ‘complicated’ mess which successive Governments have made even worse, the Institute . for Fiscal Studies said last night. Paul . Johnson, director of the economic forecaster, launched a withering . attack on a tax system which he said is riddled by complexity and shows . ‘few signs of a wider coherent strategy.’ He . criticised council tax for becoming ‘increasingly absurd’, claimed . stamp duty was ‘a strong contender for the UK’s worst-designed tax’ and . condemned the increase in the number of higher rate taxpayers to around . five million people. The number of higher rate taxpayers and those paying tax at 45 per cent has soared from 3.3million when the coalition Government came to power to an expected 5.3million next April, while rules on the chocolate eyes of gingerbread men remain complex . Every government is guilty of tweaking, tinkering and tearing up tax rules, which are then overhauled by their successors. What is left is a complex web of rules, and hundreds of bizarre unintended consequences. They include: . Mr . Johnson also ridiculed ministers for boasting about helping . ‘hard-working families’ by increasing the tax-free personal allowance - . but failing to change National Insurance. In . a speech in London last night at an event organised by the Chartered . Institute of Taxation he said Britain’s tax system is far more complex . than it needs to be. He cited . the example of VAT being charged at 20 per cent on gingerbread men . decorated with chocolate - but not charged if only two bits of chocolate . are used for the gingerbread man’s eyes. Mr . Johnson said stamp duty is ‘one of the worst designed and most damaging . of all taxes’, and is one which ‘helps to gum up the entire property . market.’ He said the tax, paid by the majority of homebuyers when purchasing a property, will be worth around £15billion a year by 2018. That compares to just £800million in 1997. It . used to be charged at one per cent on homes sold for more than £60,000, . but is now charged at five different thresholds of up to seven per cent . on homes bought for more than £2million. The . IFS singled out the absurdity of the threshold system, which means a £1 . increase in the sale price of a property can increase the tax bill by . £40,000. Mr Johnson added: ‘The case for maintaining stamp duty is very weak indeed.’ Moving . on to council tax he said it is ‘patently inequitable’ because the tax . is based on the valuation of people’s homes which was done in April . 1991. Mr Johnson warned: ‘It . seems more than likely that we will enter the 2020s and beyond with our . main property tax...based on property values from the latter part of the . last century.’ The IFS . director accused politicians of being too scared of revaluating people’s . homes because ‘the political cost of creating losers is judged too . great.’ The number of higher . rate taxpayers and those paying tax at 45 per cent has soared from . 3.3million when the coalition Government came to power to an expected . 5.3million next April. That’s . because the starting salary at which higher rate tax is paid has fallen . from £43,875 to £41,865 today and only £42,285 next April. Mr . Johnson said this ‘reflected a deliberate policy choice by a government . aiming to keep down the (huge) cost of raising the personal allowance.’ Mr Johnson also ridiculed ministers for boasting about helping 'hard-working families' by increasing the tax-free personal allowance - but failing to change National Insurance . And he said the increase in . the number of higher rate taxpayers represents a ‘fundamental change to . our tax system’, but one which has ‘never been announced or properly . debated. Meanwhile an . increase in the amount you can earn before paying tax has seen more . people paying national insurance when they are not paying income tax. Since . 2010 the personal allowance has increased from £6,475 a year to £10,000 . a year but the starting point at which National Insurance is charged . has barely changed. Mr Johnson said: ‘It is hard to think of a rationale, and none has been offered.’ More than one million low-paid workers are now paying National Insurance, but not income tax, he said. Paul Johnson, director of the economic forecaster, launched a withering attack on a tax system which he said is riddled by complexity and shows 'few signs of a wider coherent strategy' He . said it is now ‘a commonplace accepted by virtually all tax experts . outside of HM Revenue and Customs and HM Treasury that National . Insurance is no more than an additional tax on earnings’, adding: ‘They . are a tax.’ Mr Johnson said: . ‘The pious statements of politicians that they are raising the personal . allowance in order to help ‘hard-working families’ look less credible in . the face of the clear fact that raising the National Insurance primary . threshold would be more effective in doing so.’ Meanwhile, . he also singled out the failure of the Government to apply annual . inflation-linked increases to some key tax changes, such as the . scrapping of child benefit. Since . January 2013, no family is allowed to receive child benefit if one or . both parents earn more than £60,000. They start to lose child benefit . once one of their salary’s goes over £50,000. Equally, the tax-free personal allowance begins to be withdrawn once a person’s salary hits £100,000. He . said: ‘Chancellors looking to fill their coffers as a result of fiscal . drag will no doubt enjoy the effects of the lack of indexation of these . new thresholds, but this looks like a move away from rational design.’ Mr . Johnson also said the married couples’ tax allowance has been poorly . designed because it creates such a ‘cliff edge’ - that is, the problem . of becoming a higher rate taxpayer. A . couple will lose the benefit, worth around £210 a year off their tax . bill, if one of them becomes a higher rate taxpayer. For example, a £1 . pay rise could result in an additional £210 tax bill. Last . night, Patrick Stevens, tax policy director of the Chartered Institute . of Taxation, said it is ‘very important that the UK has a coherent and . workable tax system’, but warned: ‘Much work remains to be done.’ He . said politicians have ‘a duty to respond’ to Mr Johnson’s criticisms, . even though they are a ‘often driven by short-term pressures’. A . Treasury spokesman said: ‘As part of our long-term economic plan, we . have steadily cut income tax so that hard-working families have more . financial security for the future. ‘Our tax reforms have made the UK one of the most competitive countries in the world, attracting investment, jobs and business. ‘We have changed the approach to tax policy making so that it is more predictable, stable and simple.’","Paul .

"An American explorer recently became the first person to make it to the world's largest beaver dam, after trekking more than a week through 200 miles of unforgiving wilderness in northern Canada. Rob Mark, 44, of Maplewood, New Jersey, successfully made it to the dam located in Alberta's Wood Buffalo National Park on July 20, braving 'horrific' mosquitoes and dangerous swampland to be the first human to see the natural wonder in person. The beavers may have started construction on the 2,790-foot-long dam in 1975, but it was only discovered by researchers using Google Earth in October 2007. A first: New Jersey adventurer Rob Mark recently became the first man to visit the world's largest beaver dam in far northern Alberta, Canada . Amazing find: The dam was discovered by researchers in October 2007, who spotted it on Google Earth . 'Just to be able to be the first to walk somewhere where no one else did, it felt impressive. I was pretty impressed with myself,' Mark told the Edson Leader. He says the most difficult part of the journey was battling the insatiable mosquitoes, which sounded like 'helicopters', and were worse than the bugs he faced spending a month in the Amazon. Mark wore a rain jacket the whole time, to stop the mosquitoes biting through his clothes, and spent the nights sleeping in a hammock, draped in bug netting. 'Just to be able to be the first to walk somewhere where no one else did, it felt impressive. I was pretty impressed with myself,' Mark told the Edson Leader . The final mile of the journey was the most difficult, and took Mark five hours, since he had to keep himself from sinking into the constant waist-deep sludge. 'Every step you take is nerve-wracking because you don’t know how deep you’re going to sink in, and then your foot gets stuck and you have to lay down and pull it out. It’s just really, really hard going. The entire time I would never take a step without holding on to a willow or some sort of foliage,' Mark told GrindTV Outdoor. But it was worth the struggle to see the engineering marvel built by the industrious beaver colony. Hard to see: Mark says the beaver dam doesn't photograph well since it's completely overgrown in foliage . Angry beaver: The whole day Mark spent at the dam, he only saw one beaver which slapped its tail against the water in anger . 'It was the only hard ground around for miles so I was happy to stand on it,' he said. However, the dam is a marvel to be witnessed in person, since it doesn't photograph well. 'When I got there I expected to see a big beautiful dam,' Mark told GrindTV. 'It’s huge, but it’s not tall and there’s nothing to take a picture of. It’s completely covered with dirt and it’s completely overgrown. So there was no nice beaver dam face to take a picture of or anything like that.' And for such a large dam, Mark only saw one beaver the entire day he was there. 'It was incredibly angry when I was there,' Mark told the Edmonton Journal. 'It kept slapping its tail against the water.' The return trip only took Mark three days. It was his second attempt reaching the beaver dam. He failed to reach the dam two years ago, due to bad weather. The second largest beaver dam in the world is 2,139 feet and is located in Three Forks, Montana. Home: The highlighted aerial view of the dam above show the edge of the structure and the two lodges where the industrious beavers live .","Rob Mark 44, of Maplewood, New Jersey reached the 2,790-foot-long dam in Alberta, Canada on July 20 .

"You're more likely to have heard of David Beckham and Angelina Jolie than Jim Chapman or Zoella, but these YouTube vloggers are now more popular role models for young people than reality TV stars, Hollywood actors or footballers, according to research. When asked, almost 40 per cent of 16-25 year olds said they would prefer to follow in the footsteps of professional video bloggers than make a living from being a reality TV star (6 per cent) or even from a career such as law or politics (34 per cent). Almost one in three young people are avid viewers and fans of YouTube vlogs, tuning in at least twice a week; with almost half of these admitting to watching their favourite YouTube stars over ten times a weekly. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Is he YOUR idol? Vlogger Alfie Deyes, who last week released his first book, is one of the YouTube vloggers that young people now aspire to emulate the success of . Young people think that being snapped in a national newspaper is no longer enough to classify someone as ‘famous’. The digitally-savvy 'selfie generation' believe that the top indicator for fame now must include a huge social media presence, such as having over two million YouTube subscribers (55 per cent), or over half a million Twitter followers (37 per cent), found the survey by Tesco Mobile. And it seems that these youngsters have good reason to aspire to be YouTube stars. For the likes of Jim Chapman, Tanya Burr and Alfie Deyes, filming their daily musings and sharing them on YouTube has snowballed from an innocent hobby to a multi-million pound making machine. So successful have certain vloggers become that they're set to take the world of literature, beauty and television by storm. Alfie Deyes, a 20-year-old Youtube personality, is case in point. The star from Brighton is the wholesome (and rather well groomed) face behind the PointlessBlog, a Youtube 'vlog' that documents his life. He began creating his pioneering videos at the age of 15 with titles including 'Girls are confusing', often featuring YouTuber girlfriend Zoe Sugg (otherwise known as Zoella) and friends Marcus Butler and Caspar Lee. The PointlessBlog celebrated its fifth anniversary in July 2014 and #5YearsOfPointlessBlog trended worldwide number #1 for 9.5 hours. Power couple: Alfie is part of a new wave of vloggers who have found fame online, here he is pictured with fellow Vlogger and girlfriend Zoella at her beauty range launch . Popular: Alfie's videos have attracted over 3M subscribers and he is now looking to the print industry to extend his success . His book which he is calling 'a gift to his fans' takes on a similar premise to his videos encouraging readers to take on harmless 'pointless' tasks and 'challenges of nothingness' including baking a cake in a mug and creating a time capsule. The 20-year-old's vlog content seems to match it's namesake  but however mundane the content may seem it has attracted an army of followers. Alfie currently has 5,380,000 YouTube subscribers and his book seems to be going in the same direction. The Pointless Book has already reached the top of the Amazon best-sellers list. According to the Telegraph, at his book signing at Waterstone's in London's Piccadilly Circus the popular vlogger was met by 8000 screaming fans. Alfie Deyes who is naturally flattered by the reaction says that he thinks that it is his down to earth attitude that has won him his fandom. 'I think I'm just someone my viewers can relate to.' Alfie is fast becoming a familiar face and is regularly approached by fans when he is out and about but for Alfie this is just one of the perks of the job. Beauty girls: Zoe Sugg, left, who goes by the virtual name of Zoella, and Tanya Burr, right, have both created beauty ranges for Superdrug, which have sold out . He says of being mobbed by fans whenever he goes shopping: 'I love it! I just double the amount of time I would previously have allowed for the trip.' Alfie Deyes: 3m . Tanya Burr: 2.4m . Jim Chapman: 1.8m . Zoella: 6m . The 20-year-old has already seen his vlog take him to new and exciting places with some of the best perks including trips to America, Canada for Digifest US and Dubai. And this is only the beginning for the power player, who told this weekend's Observer that he would consider moving into the world of conventional, networked TV and radio - only as long as he was in control of the content. 'Having creative control, as well as carrying out the whole process myself - shooting, editing and post-production - of all my videos is important,' he said. 'But I would not completely reject TV. If something were to come up where I had enough control and it was suitable for my fanbase, I would consider it.' Big launch: The online launch of her bath range, which ranges in price from £4-£10, saw the social media sweetheart sell thousands of products in just minutes, with over ten per cent of shoppers logging on to the Zoella pages of the Superdrug website before it was even on sale . Gloss posse: So influential is Tanya that she created a range of lipglosses and nail varnishes on sale in Superdrug. When the products went on sale exclusively on feelunique.com, they amassed the biggest waiting list the site has ever witnessed . Deyes isn't the only one making waves in the virtual world. His girlfriend Zoe Sugg, a.k.a Zoella, started her channel in 2009 to share her love of all things fashion and beauty. Today, aged 24, she has over 5.5m subscribers and millions of social media followers and last week launched her first ever beauty collection at Superdrug - and sales are already on track to make this the biggest brand launch of the year. The online launch of her bath range, which ranges in price from £4-£10, saw the social media sweetheart sell thousands of products in just minutes, with over ten per cent of shoppers logging on to the Zoella pages of the Superdrug website before it was even on sale. From tomorrow, the collection will also be available exclusively at 102 Superdrug stores nationwide, and fans are expected to strip the shelves of the range of seven products, featuring images of her beloved guinea pigs Pippin and Percy. New launch: Zoella unveiled her bath range on Friday (Jamie Oliver even went to the launch because his daughters are such huge fans) A spokesperson for Superdrug said: 'YouTube and social media has introduced the world to a whole new type of star. These bloggers and vloggers invite viewers in to their homes and lives, building a rapport and sense of trust in a way we haven’t seen before. 'Beauty bloggers creating their own beauty ranges makes perfect sense, as shoppers trust their online idols to create products they would use themselves. At Superdrug we’ve been quick to tap into this trend and earlier this year launched an exclusive cosmetics range by Tanya Burr (2.5m YouTube subscribers) and our best-selling brand of make-up brushes Real Techniques has been created by the PixiWoo sisters (1.6m YouTube subscribers).' To celebrate the launch of her new range, Zoella will be meeting fans in Superdrug later this month. Brit favourite Tanya Burr accumulates 10m views per month on her channel, has almost 2m subscribers and nearly a million Twitter followers. So influential is Tanya that she has created a range of lipglosses and nail varnishes on sale in Superdrug. When the products went on sale exclusively on feelunique.com, they amassed the biggest waiting list the site has ever witnessed. Youtube originals: Jim Chapman, Zoe Sugg and Tanya Burr attend YouTube phenomenon Zoe Sugg's (Zoella) launch of her debut beauty collection . Speaking to MailOnline about her success, the 24-year-old said: 'I'm not entirely sure how my YouTube channel has become such a success, but I think it could be to do with my positive, friendly personality. 'I think the girls who watch my videos can relate to me as I'm not a traditional celebrity that seems unattainable, I'm still just a normal girl despite my large following. 'People say that when they watch my videos thy feel like I'm their friend and I love that. When I meet fans in the street I always feel like we could be best friends as we seem to always have lots in common which is lovely! 'I think the world of YouTube is amazing in that you can feel like you're hanging out with your girlfriends just by watching a video. It's also incredible in that, if it wasn't for my YouTube channel, I wouldn't have started my own makeup line. Party girl: Tanya Burr walks all the big red carpet and hit showbiz's biggest events, such as the TV Baftas . 'I couldn't have done it without the support of my fans. I spent a year and a half developing my lip gloss and nail polish range and was involved every step of the way. I started with these products as I feel like lip gloss and nail polish are fun items of beauty as you can wear so many different colours and play around lots. 'I love the colours I designed so much and I named them after all of my favourite things and places. For example, I got engaged in New York so I named one of the darker polishes New York Night and I love picnics so I named my favourite pretty pink gloss Picnic In The Park.' Tanya, who often sits front row at fashion week and is a regular on the London social circuit, is already planning her next range of beauty products, which are likely to have similar success. As well as adding eight new lip gloss colours to her range next week, at the end of October, she will be launching something totally new that's 'top secret', she tells MailOnline. Her fiance Jim Chapmam, whose sisters are the brains behind the amazing Real Techniques cosmetic brush brand, is also seeing his star rise. He just signed a modelling contract with esteemed agency, Model 1, and is a presenter on Simon Cowell's syco Youtube channel. Conquering the fashion world: Tanya Burr also recently curated her first range for Very.co.uk .","Youngsters idolise vloggers with millions of followers .

"Nibbling contentedly at a twig, this beaver is one of a group caught in an unprecedented conservation battle. At least ten have made their home on the banks of a Devon river, to the delight of wildlife lovers. But the first beavers to breed in the wild in England for 800 years face a threat from an unexpected quarter – the men from the ministry. This exclusive Daily Mail photograph captures on the River Otter beavers in close up for the first time . For officials from the environment department, Defra, say the creatures must be caught and culled or rehomed in zoos. They claim the beavers, which have been living and breeding on a 12-mile stretch of the River Otter for at least five years, may carry diseases that could harm other species or even pose a risk to human health. Whitehall has issued licences for pest controllers to round them up and cages have already been bought. But wildlife experts and conservationists have begun a court battle to save the beavers and 12,000 people have signed a petition to back their cause. Environmental charity Friends of the Earth has started legal action in a bid to block Defra, claiming that rounding up the beavers would be illegal. It says they are protected under European law and alternatives to their removal have not been properly considered. The Devon Wildlife Trust agrees the beavers should be caught and tested for disease, but wants them returned to the river afterwards and has submitted a proposal to monitor them for a further five years. The trust’s Peter Burgess said: ‘They do not have a big negative impact. They have been there for four or five years and nobody has noticed, let alone complained. Beavers have a hugely beneficial impact on rivers. ‘They provide habitats for other species. Our rivers are not in great health and one solution is to have these natural engineers back in our watercourses.’ Friends of the Earth campaigner Alasdair Cameron said: ‘At a time when our wildlife is facing an unprecedented crisis, the Government should be taking steps to protect and expand the range of key native species like the beaver – not removing them. Officials have claimed that beavers may carry diseases that could harm other species or even pose a risk to human health . ‘Beavers can bring many benefits – as well as injecting a little more joy into our landscape.’ Retired environmental scientist Tom Buckley, who spotted the first of the beaver group near Ottery St Mary a year ago, said: ‘There is an overwhelming majority of people are in favour of the beavers staying and being left alone by the Government.’ Beavers were wiped out by hunters in the Middle Ages and their reappearance in Devon remains a mystery. There are several captive breeding programmes, one 30 miles away. But none of the animals is missing. A Defra spokesman said: ‘The beavers on the River Otter may carry a disease which could pose a risk to human health. That is why it’s our responsibility to take precautionary action.’ A bid to reintroduce beavers to the wild in Scotland is considered an outstanding success and has caused no threat to other species. Five families were trapped in Norway and released into the remote forests and lochs of Knapdale in Argyll in 2009 and 2010. Some died and some disappeared but others bred and 14 young – known as kits – have been born. The beavers have engineered dams 60ft long, while the biggest lodge is as large as a double garage. Their presence has boosted local tourism, with more than 30,000 people taking part in walks, talks and education sessions and more than 200 school and college visits. Those running the five-year trial say it has shown that beavers can live and breed in the Scottish countryside. The results will be presented to the Scottish Parliament, which is expected to give the go ahead for the programme to be expanded. However, it could also shut the project and order the beavers to be put down, or trapped and taken to a zoo.","Officials from Defra say beavers must either be culled or rehomed in a zoo .

"Officials in suburban Orlando, Florida, are searching for an ex-convict who they say is responsible for a crash this afternoon that killed a little girl inside a day care center and left 13 others injured. Local television showed multiple people, including children, being wheeled away on stretchers Wednesday afternoon. Small children and infants in cribs were evacuated from the building and deposited outside on the playground. Just after 3pm on Wednesday afternoon a Dodge . slammed into this suburban Orlando daycare and then fled the scene. More than a . dozen people, including 12 children, were rushed to hospitals . Impact: Police say a silver or grayish Dodge crashed into a vehicle that then struck the Goldenrod Road KinderCare at North Goldenrod Road and University Boulevard in Winter Park . Chaos: The inside of the KinderCare classroom is a shambles after the car was towed out of the scene where several children were injured . Disbelief: Rescue officials say 15 people, including 11 children, were injured including Lily in the horror wreck . The Florida Highway Patrol officials say some of the victims are in 'very, very serious' condition. In all, 12 people were hospitalized and . two others were treated at the scene, said John Mulhall, a spokesman for . the Orange County Fire Rescue. Six of the kids who suffered the most serious injuries were rushed to Arnold Palmer Hospital. One person at the hospital was in critical condition and five others were in serious condition, said Katie Dagenais, a spokeswoman for Arnold Palmer. The name of the 4-year-old girl killed in the crash has not been released. Wanted: Robert Cochardo, 28, is being sought by the Florida Highway Patrol in connection to the KinderCare hit-and-run accident . Two of the surviving victims, including a 3-year-old girl named June, were reportedly pinned under the car that slammed into the building and had to be extracted by first responders. Children who have escaped unharmed were taken to a safe place within a portion of the building that was not affected by the collision, and officials took a roll call so they could reunite them with their parents. Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs called the crash 'an absolute tragedy and disaster.' Police say a silver Dodge Durango crashed into a Toyota Solara convertible, which then struck the Goldenrod Road KinderCare at North Goldenrod Road and University Boulevard in Winter Park just after 3pm. The Durango then took off from the scene, heading into Seminole County. The Toyota driver was not hurt. Troopers have implored the public to . come forward if they have any information about the vehicle or its . owner. The 2004-2006 Durango had wheelchairs in the back and would have . front-end damage and its front bumper missing. Just . after 5pm, the Florida Highway Patrol announced that the SUV involved . in the hit-and-run has been found abandoned, but the driver, identified as . 28-year-old Robert Corchado, was not yet in custody. Authorities . had initially believed the person of interest may attempt to flee the area by boarding . a flight from Orlando International Airport,. FHP . officials said he drove to the airport, rented a Mazda CSX-1 SUV with . the license plate CHRQ41, and then left. Anyone who sees him is being . asked to call 911.

Court records cited by Orlando Sentinel show he was sentenced to three years in prison in 2010 for cocaine trafficking. He was released in 2012. Last December, the 28-year-old was arrested for heroin and cocaine possesion with intent to sell, and another hit-and-run involving property damage. In 2004, he was arrested on charges of extortion, conspiracy and tampering with a witness. A year later, Cochardo landed in police custody once again for allegedly making threats and extortion.

"The recent recession triggered a surge in suicides, particularly amongst men. A new study has found the financial crisis between 2008 and 2010 was responsible for thousands of deaths across Europe and North America. The research, published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, shows that suicide rates ‘rose significantly’ after the 2007 financial crash. The financial crisis was responsible for at least 10,000 suicides, new research suggests . Experts from the University of Oxford and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said the increase was four times higher among men than women. They analysed data from the World Health Organisation about suicides in 24 EU countries, the U.S. and Canada. Between 2007, when the economic crisis began, and 2009, suicide rates rose in Europe by 6.5 per cent, they found. The rates remained elevated until 2011. This corresponds to an additional 7,950 suicides than would have been expected across these EU countries during this time period, they said. Before the recession suicide rates had been falling in Europe, they added. In addition, suicide rates in Canada and the U.S. rose by 4.5 per cent and 4.8 per cent respectively, during the same time. Redundancies, debt and home repossessions were the main causes of suicides related to the recession . Overall there were at least 10,000 additional suicides as a result of the crisis, the authors say. But they added that this is a conservative estimate. Job loss, home repossession and debt are the main causes of suicide during economic downturns, they believe. ‘There has been a substantial rise in suicides during the recession, greater than we would have anticipated based on previous trends,’ said lead author Dr Aaron Reeves, of Oxford University’s Department of Sociology. ‘A critical question for policy and psychiatric practice is whether suicide rises are inevitable. ‘This study shows that rising suicides have not been observed everywhere so while recessions will continue to hurt, they don’t always cause self-harm. ‘A range of interventions, from return to work programmes through to antidepressant prescriptions, may reduce the risk of suicide during future economic downturns.’ Co-author Professor David Stuckler, also from the University of Oxford, added: ‘Suicides are just the tip of the iceberg. These data reveal a looming mental health crisis in Europe and North America. ‘In these hard economic times, this research suggests it is critical to look for ways of protecting those who are likely to be hardest hit.' Most suicides are committed by people with clinical depression, and the research revealed a marked rise in antidepressant use during the economic downturn. In the UK, prescriptions of the drugs soared by 19 per cent between 2007 and 2010. Programmes that actively help people who are out of work appeared to reduce the number of suicides, according to the findings. The researchers estimated that every $100 (US) (£59.57) spent per head on assistance for the unemployed lowered the risk of suicide by 0.4 per cent. During the financial crisis, the suicide rate among men rose much faster than the suicide rate among women . Austria, Sweden and Finland were examples of countries where suicide rate did not rise markedly despite rising unemployment during the 2008 to 2010 recession. In Sweden and Finland the rate remained stable while in Austria it actually decreased. An earlier period of increasing unemployment in the 1990s saw suicide rates go down in both Sweden and Finland. Those few industrialised countries that escaped the recession, such as New Zealand, also avoided a rise in suicides, the study found. In the EU, the number of suicides per 100,000 of the population declined from just under 12 to around 10 between 2001 and 2006. Then it began to rise, increasing by 6.5 per cent before levelling out in 2009/10.
