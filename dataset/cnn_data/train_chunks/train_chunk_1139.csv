"Denmark, which like its Nordic neighbours prides itself on promoting equal treatment for men and women, has taken gender equality all the way to the beauty salon. A ruling last month by Denmark's Board of Equal Treatment effectively stated that price differences between men's and women's haircuts were illegal. It ordered a salon advertising women's haircuts for 528 crowns - £59 - and men's haircuts for 428 crowns - £48 - plus an extra fee for long hair, to pay 2,500 crowns - £281- to a woman who had filed a complaint. Hair-raising decision: Denmark's Board of Equal Treatment effectively ruled last month that price differences between men's and women's haircuts were illegal . Now, a trade organisation for hairdressers has called the decision absurd, saying it will become a nightmare to set prices for customers and warning of 'pricing chaos'. 'It takes, quite simply, longer time with women,' said Connie Mikkelsen, chairwoman of the Danish organisation for independent hairdressers and cosmeticians. The board's decision has been appealed and a court will determine whether hairdressers need to find a new way to charge for their services, in the length of time, or the standard of the cut. 'Measuring time will lead to a discussion of hair length - what is medium length, and what is long. It will end in a series of conflicts with customers,' Mikkelsen said. Nordic countries consistently hold some of the highest rankings in global gender equality indices. Denmark ranked seventh out of 135 countries in the World Economic Forum's global gender gap index which benchmarks national gender gaps on economic, political, education and health criteria.

"An historic castle once owned by Henry VIII has been put up for sale for £2.6 million. The notorious monarch exchanged the stunning Westenhanger Manor in 1523 for other lands with Sir Edward Poynings, who served as a diplomat under Henry VII. There he entertained guests, held meetings of state, threw lavish feasts and brought his mistresses for weekend breaks, away from the watchful eyes of his six wives. It remained a royal palace until 1581 when Queen Elizabeth I gave it to her Collector of Customs, Thomas Smythe. The fortified property dates back as far as 1045 AD when it was occupied by King Canute. King's rule: Henry VIII exchanged Westenhanger Manor in 1523 for other lands with Sir Edward Poynings, who served as a diplomat under Henry VII . Rich history: Parts of the fortified property date back as far as 1045 AD when it was occupied by King Canute. Under Henry VIII the tower was converted into a dove cote, housing birds for the king to eat . Hunting ground: Henry VIII carried out minimal works to the manor and in 1542 ordered the laying out of a deer park so he could hunt in the castle's grounds . In recent years the Grade I listed home, regarded as one of Kent’s greatest historical houses, became little more than a ruin. But the current owners, the Forge family, have spent the past 16 years setting about saving Westenhanger Manor. Graham Forge, 75, who owns the . property, said: 'Henry VIII effectively used Westenhanger as his private B&B when visiting the south of England on state affairs. 'He certainly would never have brought any of his wives here but is known to have taken his mistresses to the house instead. 'He made many large improvements to the house because he was concerned about an invasion and wanted a permanent castle on the south coast.' Very little else is known about what actually happened when Henry VIII visited Westenhanger because next to nothing was written down, said Mr Forge. 'He also developed the gardens for his daughter Mary who he hoped would move in,' he added. 'Although there's no evidence she ever even visited the manor.' It was Elizabeth instead who used the . property, often entertaining more than 300 guests at any one time with . lavish feasts that could last for days. But in 1581 she was forced to . give the castle up to Thomas Smythe. In the Royal hands: Henry VIII exchanged other lands for the manor in 1523 and it was held as a Royal palace until his daughter, Elizabeth I, gave it away, probably to cover her debts . Grand courtyard: Under Henry VIII's rule, this part of the gardens would have been a vast courtyard where Henry would have rode into followed by dozens of soldiers as he visited the southern corner of his realm . Fit for a king: This would have been Henry VIII's banquet hall where he entertained guests with lavish feasts of pigeon, deer, boar and lots of wine . 'Elizabeth didn't like Smythe at all,' says Mr Forge. 'In fact she was . most probably intimidated by him... not least because he stood at a . giant 5'7"". 'His job was to . collect customs in the south of England and raised more than £30,000 - a whopping sum in those days. Given her dislike for Smythe, she most . likely gave it to him because she owed him money. What we do know is . that no cash ever changed hands between them.' The . Forge family, a family of engineers, bought the castle from the . Ministry of Transport and started carrying out millions of pounds of . sensitive restorations with the help of English Heritage. They are now selling Westenhanger Castle with estate agents Jackson-Stops & Staff for £2.6 million. The house currently comprises three bedrooms, three reception rooms and two bathrooms. The main reception room has a fine inglenook fireplace and splendid oak beams while a second reception room boasts a brick fireplace and flagstone floor with underfloor heating. There is also the central living accommodation which is currently incomplete and set over three floors. A replica medieval kitchen is also under construction. Grandiose: The roof of the hall is built in signature Tudor style. It dates back to around the 15th Century though it was repeatedly refurbished by Henry VIII . Living room: This room would have served as Henry's living room where he relaxed in front of the fire with courtiers, mistresses and entertainers . For £2.6 million, any buyer will also get a wedding venue set in the 14 acres of grounds. This includes an outbuilding with kitchen, bar and toilets joining a large marquee. But there are significant running costs involved with the upkeep of the grand property, with maintenance costing around £100,000 a year. However, the manor is a money maker, hosting around 25 weddings each year. The bridal suite comprises the exquisite bedroom with an exceptionally fine stone mullioned leaded light window believed to date from around 1500. It has ancient “graffiti” to the inner left side jamb of the window said to depict James II. The grounds of Westenhanger Manor also boast two remarkable 16th century Grade I list barns which are being offered separately. One of these has one of the finest hammer beam roof structures in the UK while the other is needs to be restored. Graham Forge bought the castle from the Department of Transport for £330,000 in 1996. The DoT had taken possession of it a couple of years earlier when the previous residents had fled. Mr Forge, a retired engineer, has now decided it is time for someone new to take on Westenhanger Manor. Wedding room: This room, to the front of the house, also served as living quarters. It is now used to hold wedding ceremonies . Party house: Elizabeth I used the property more than Henry, often entertaining more than 300 guests at any one time with lavish feasts that could last for days. But in 1581 she was forced to give the castle up to Thomas Smythe . Grand: These stairs lead up to the bedrooms where Henry held meetings with both his courtiers and his mistresses . He said: 'When we bought it we thought about turning it into a hotel but it is too special for that so we spent 16 years restoring it. 'All the essential work is done, we have never had any archeology work carried out because of the huge cost, instead we saved our pennies for the restoration. 'My wife, who I have been married to for 52 years, loves the property. You try hard not to fall in love with it but it's hard. 'We've had so many special times here from parties and birthdays to family weddings. I think it is the best place in the world but I'm 75 now. It has been a great experience, we love it but it is time to move on.' The castle was under Henry VIII's ownership from 1523 until his death in 1547 at the age of 55. During that period the property was extended with separate suites of rooms for the use of royalty and at one point it had 126 rooms. In 1552, Thomas Smythe, a Collector of Customs, moved into the castle with his wife Alice following their marriage. Queen Elizabeth I visited the castle on a number of occasions and stayed there with her entourage of 300. It remained a Royal Palace until 1581 when Elizabeth I handed it to Mr Smythe. Customer Smythe, as he became known, died a wealthy man in 1591, owning 12 manors including nearby Leeds Castle in Kent. Mr Forge has been hosting weddings at the property for eight years, which he describes as 'very successful'. He added: 'Originally it covered three corners and was three storeys high but in the 18th century it was damaged by a number of fires and they decided to pull a lot of it down, only leaving one corner. 'Henry II kept his mistress here and when King Canute was dying, he drew up a charter to pass the property on to the Archbishop of Canterbury. That charter still hangs in the British library. 'English Heritage value the property enormously and we hope it will find the right owner who can carry on the work.'","The notorious monarch exchanged stunning Westenhanger Manor in 1523 for other lands with Sir Edward Poynings .

"Glenn Mason was jailed for 15 months today after the Old Bailey heard he stole £185,000 from the accounts of elderly Natwest customers to fund his online gambling addiction . A respected NatWest bank manager who stole £185,000 from his elderly customers to fund his internet gambling addiction sobbed as he was jailed for 15 months. Glenn Mason, 56, plundered the accounts of nine pensioners including an 83 year-old woman and a 92 year-old man who banked at his branch in Biggin Hill, Kent. Mason, who was given an award by the Metropolitan Police in Bromley in 2009 for his crime fighting efforts, got away with the thefts for almost a year before his arrest in July 2012. His attempts to cover up his crime by transferring money using the identity of two of his colleagues, Julie Jeffrey, 50, and James Cato, 35, led to them being sacked and charged with fraud. It was only when Mason pleaded guilty in September that the case against them was dropped at the Old Bailey. Andrew Lawson, representing Mason, told the court that Mason turned to gambling after his teenage son was injured by a roadside bomb while fighting with British troops in Afghanistan. Mr Lawson said that all of the stolen money was paid into his gambling account and told the court: ‘It was late night poker and online games that are designed to tempt you into spending money in the hope of a big win.’ The court also heard statements from two of Mason’s victims, Julie Amos and Leslie Pilditch, who both said they no longer felt able to trust banks. Julie Jeffrey, one of the workers implicated in the crime by Mason, described how she lost her job after her arrest and added: ‘I no longer feel proud, my life has fallen apart.’ Elaine May, the current manager of the NatWest Biggin Hill branch, also said in a statement that the thefts had ‘an ongoing impact within the community’ and put a strain upon the staff. Mason continues to live in the area with his wife and son and has been working in a local newsagents. The judge, Mr Recorder Simon Farrell QC, told him: ‘You stole roughly £185,000 over a period of a year from nine victims who were all elderly and undoubtedly vulnerable. ‘Your fellow worker Julie Jeffrey, who was falsely arrested because you used her ID details to steal the money, described how, having worked for NatWest since the age of 16, losing her job as a 50 year-old woman and being reduced to delivery leaflets in all weathers. ‘Plainly these are very serious offences which everyone agrees cross the custody threshold. You are of previous good character and someone who has suffered considerable personal tragedy. ‘Your wife suffered from cancer in 2005 and your son at only 19 went to Afghanistan to fight for his country and was the victim of an improvised explosive device that caused him very serious injury. The court heard Mason's actions, which took place at Natwest in Biggin Hill (pictured), caused elderly customers to lose their faith in banks . The judge added: ‘I accept this caused you to develop a serious gambling addiction which was in fact the root cause of stealing the money from customers. ‘In my judgement I am afraid these matters are so serious that I am not able to suspend the sentence. The best I can do is to pass a sentence of 15 months imprisonment. But for your personal mitigation this sentence would have been far longer.’ Mason, of Biggin Hill, pleaded guilty to a single charge of fraud. The case against Jeffrey, of Orpington, Kent, and Cato, of Plumstead, south London, was discontinued by the prosecution. Both provided alibis when interviewed by police but they were only accepted by the Crown when Mason indicated his plea.Mason made no comment in police interview.","Bank manager Glenn Mason stole money to play late night poker online .

"Incredible new images released by NASA show the terrifying scale and power of the Oklahoma tornado as seen from space. The giant twister that pulverized the suburb of Moore on Monday was up to 600 times more powerful than the atomic bomb that levelled Hiroshima. Wind speed, air moisture, temperature and timing all came together to create the perfect storm, which left at least 24 dead, including nine children, and some 237 injured. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . View from space: This image released by NASA shows the growing storm system just minutes before the devastating twister formed in Oklahoma . Terrifying: NASA has released this spectacular image of the fierce twister from space . Force: The tornado can be seen making its way across Oklahoma, leaving a trail of devastation in its wake . Using real time measurements to . calculate the energy released during the storm's 40-minute life span, . meteorologists estimate the tornado had eight times to more than 600 . times the power of the bomb that flattened the Japanese city during . World War II, with more experts at the high end. Their calculations, based on energy . measured in the air and then multiplied over the size and duration of . the storm, come as NASA released spectacular images of the fierce . twister from space. On . Tuesday, the National Weather Service gave it the top-of-the-scale . rating of EF5 for wind speed and breadth, and severity of damage. Wind . speeds were estimated at between 200 and 210 mph. The United States averages about one EF-5 a year, but this was the first in nearly two years. Levelled: Wind speed, air moisture, temperature and timing all came together to create the perfect storm, which left at least 24 dead, including nine children, and some 237 injured . Path of destruction: The National Weather Service gave the tornado a top-of-the-scale rating of EF-5 for wind speed, breadth and severity of damage. Wind speeds were estimated at between 200 and 210mph . Goldilocks phenomena: The weather conditions such as the humidity and a cold downdraft had to be just right for such a powerful tornado to form, experts say . To . get such an uncommon storm to form is 'a bit of a Goldilocks problem,' said Pennsylvania State University meteorology professor Paul Markowski. 'Everything has to be just right.' For . example, there must be humidity for a tornado to form, but too much can . cut the storm off. The same goes with the cold air in a downdraft: Too . much can be a storm-killer. But when the ideal conditions do occur, watch out. The power of nature beats out anything man can create. 'Everything . was ready for explosive development yesterday,' said Colorado State . University meteorology professor Russ Schumacher, who was in Oklahoma . launching airborne devices that measured the energy, moisture and wind . speeds on Monday. 'It all just unleashed on that one area.' An . EF5 tornado has the most violent winds on Earth, more powerful than a . hurricane. The strongest winds ever measured were the 302 mph reading, . measured by radar, during the EF5 tornado that struck Moore on May 3, . 1999, according to Jeff Masters, meteorology director at the Weather . Underground. Monster: Meteorologists estimate the storm on Monday had between eight and 600 times more energy than Hiroshima . Dwarfed: Monday's tornado dwarfed the power of the atomic bomb, pictured, that was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, August 6, 1945 . Still, when it comes to weather . events, scientists usually know more about and can better predict . hurricanes, winter storms, heat waves and other big events. That's . because even though a tornado like the one that struck Moore was 1.3 . miles wide, with a path of 17 miles long, in meteorological terms it was . small, hard to track, rare and even harder to study. So . tornadoes are still more of a mystery than their hurricane cousins, . even though tropical storms form over ocean areas where no one is, while . this tornado formed only miles from the very National Weather Service . office that specializes in tornadoes. 'This . phenomenon can be so deadly you would think that something that . catastrophic, that severe would lend itself to understanding,' said Adam . Houston, meteorology professor at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. 'But we're fighting the inherent unpredictability of these small-scale . phenomena.' Ruins: The bomb on August 6, 1945 left Hiroshima in tatters, pictured . Man-made: The blast devastated the Japanese city, however it had only a fraction of the energy of Monday's natural disaster . Unlike hurricanes, which forecasters can fly through in planes and monitor with buoys and weather stations, usually over a period of days, tornadoes form quickly and normally last only a matter of minutes. While meteorologists and television hosts chase tornadoes and try to get readings, it's not usually enough. This storm lasted 40 minutes -- long for a regular tornado but not too unusual for such a violent one, said research meteorologist Harold Brooks at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Oklahoma. Still, the conditions needed to form such a violent and devastating tornado were there and forecasters knew it, warning five days in advance that something big could happen, Brooks said. By Monday morning, forecasters at the National Weather Center, home of the storm lab and storm prediction center, knew 'that any storm that formed in that environment had the potential to be a strong to violent tornado,' he said. 'This is a pretty classic setup,' Brooks said. Pummeled: This aerial photo shows, from bottom to top, the path Monday's tornado took through Moore, Oklahoma, leaving it destruction in its path . Flattened: The monster tornado leveled approximately 2,300 homes . Tornadoes have two main ingredients: moist energy in the atmosphere and wind shear. Wind shear is the difference between wind at high altitudes and wind near the surface. The more moist energy and the greater the wind shear, the better the chances for tornadoes. But just because the conditions are right doesn't mean a violent tornado will form, and scientists still don't know why they occur in certain spots in a storm and not others, and why at certain times and not others. On Monday, the moist energy came up from the Gulf of Mexico, the wind shear from the jet stream plunging from Canada. 'Where they met is where the Moore storm got started,' Brooks said. With the third strong storm hitting Moore in 14 years -- and following roughly the same path as an EF5 that killed 40 people in 1999 and an EF4 that injured 45 others in 2003 -- some people are wondering why Moore? It's a combination of geography, meteorology and lots of bad luck, experts said. If you look at the climate history of tornadoes in May, you will see they cluster in a spot, maybe 100 miles wide, in central Oklahoma, Houston said. That's where the weather conditions of warm, moist air and strong wind shear needed for tornadoes combine, in just the right balance. 'Central Oklahoma is a hot spot and there's a good reason for it,' Houston said. 'There's this perfect combination where the jet stream is strong, the instability is large and the typical position for this juxtaposition climatologically is central Oklahoma.' And the timing has to be perfect. Earlier in the year, there's not enough warm moist air, but the jet stream is stronger. Later, the jet stream is weaker but the air is moister and warmer. Survivors: Jon Johnson, left, looks through what is remains of his home at 14716 S. Broadway with his brother Matt Johnson on Tuesday . Recovery@ A firefighter watches vehicles pass by in front of a destroyed home north of SW 149th between Western and Santa Fe on Tuesday, May 21, 2013, after a tornado struck south Oklahoma City and Moore, Oklahoma, on Monday . The hot spot is more than just the city of Moore. Several meteorologists offer the same explanation for why that Oklahoma City suburb seemed to be hit repeatedly by violent tornadoes: Bad luck. Of the 60 EF5 tornadoes since 1950, Oklahoma and Alabama have been struck the most, seven times each. More than half of these top-of-the-scale twisters are in just five states: Oklahoma, Alabama, Texas, Kansas, and Iowa. Less than 1 percent of all U .S. tornadoes are this violent -- only about 10 a year, Brooks said. The United States' Great Plains is the 'best place on Earth' for the formation of violent tornadoes because of geography, Markowski said. You need the low pressure systems coming down off the Rocky Mountains colliding with the warm moist unstable air coming north from the Gulf of Mexico. Scientists know the key ingredients that go into a devastating tornado. But they are struggling to figure out why they develop in some big storms and not others. They also are still trying to determine what effects, if any, global warming has on tornadoes. The jet stream can shift to cause a record number of tornadoes -- or an unusually low number of them. Early research, much of it by Brooks, predicts that as the world warms, the moist energy -- or instability -- will increase, and the U.S. will have more thunderstorms. But at the same time, the needed wind shear -- the difference between wind speed and direction at different altitudes -- will likely decrease. The two factors go in different directions and it's hard to tell which will win out. Brooks and others think that eventually there may be more thunderstorms and fewer days with tornadoes, but more tornadoes on those days when twisters do strike. 'Tornadoes are perhaps the most difficult things to connect to climate change of any extreme,' said NASA climate scientist Tony Del Genio. 'Because we still don't understand all the factors required to get a tornado.'","Wind speed, air moisture, temperature and timing all came together to create the perfect storm, which left at least 24 dead, including nine children, and some 237 injured .

"A mother was unable to abort her severely disabled son despite doctors' warnings after seeing her baby's smile in a 3D scan picture. Katyia Rowe was told her baby's brain had not formed properly and that he would never walk or talk and would need 24-hour care. But after seeing real-time moving scans of him smiling, blowing bubbles, kicking and waving his arms she made the heartbreaking decision to go through with the birth. Tragically Lucian, as she named him, died nine hours after he was born. Mother Katyia Rowe gave birth to her severely disabled son Lucian, despite doctors advising her to have an abortion, after seeing a 3D scan of him smiling, pictured . Despite the ordeal, Ms Rowe said she had no regrets going through with the birth as she was able to cuddle her baby son. Katyia, 26, a training administrator, said: 'We were devastated to be told our son’s . brain abnormalities were so severe they were life limiting we should . consider a termination. ‘Further scans were arranged to asses . the extent of his disabilities but when I saw him smiling and playing . inside me I knew I couldn’t end his life. 'If he could smile and play and feel . then despite his disabilities he deserved to enjoy whatever life he had . left, no matter how short. Just because his life would be shorter or . different, didn’t mean he didn’t deserve to experience it. ‘As long as he was pain free I vowed to let him enjoy his life both while inside me and outside, no matter how long that be.’ Miss Rowe, from Telford, Shropshire was thrilled to discover she was expecting a baby with partner of four years security officer Shane Johnson, 26, in March last year. She added: ‘It was a shock but we were thrilled. Shane and I were so excited and looking forward to the birth. We had so many plans for the future and could not wait to meet our baby. Katyia Rowe and her partner Shane decided to have the baby despite the complications, saying the child deserved to live . ‘Our first scan at three months was wonderful. When we saw our baby on screen for the first time we fell in love straight away. As far as we were concerned everything was perfect.’ The couple decided to wed when their son was old enough to walk down the aisle with them. Only the 20-week scan highlighted complications. Following further tests, doctors told Miss . Rowe and her partner of four years that their baby's brain had no . formed properly and he would be severely disabled. They were then told the tragic news by experts at Birmingham Children's Hospital that their child would never walk or talk and would need 24-hour care. The couple were offered the chance to terminate the baby at 24-weeks. But despite his poor prognosis, being able to watch her son in real time 3D scans during the screening tests, Miss Rowe said she was astonished to see him smiling, blowing bubbles, kicking and waving his arms. She said: ‘Despite all the awful things I was being told, while he was inside me his quality of life looked to be wonderful and no different to any other baby’s, he was a joy to watch. ‘I was told he would never walk or talk yet the scans showed him constantly wriggling and moving. ‘As I watched I knew that while I was carrying him he still had a quality of life and it was my duty as a mother to protect that no matter how long he had left, he deserved to live.’ The couple pictured together in the room that was decorated for their baby boy Lucian. Tragically he died nine hours after his birth . Katyia was told if her son survived . birth he would require 24 -hour care for the duration of his life . expected to be anything up to five years. She added: ‘It didn’t phase me at . all. It was ironic because I had never considered myself particularly . maternal but now I wanted nothing more than to care for my son and give . him the best quality of life possible. I was more than happy to dedicate . my life fully to his care. Katyia Rowe who went through the birth of her baby, pictured in a frame, and said she didn't regret her decision . ‘I researched all his disabilities to . prepare myself fully for his needs. I never had a moment of doubt. I . only had to look at the scan pictures of him enjoying life in the womb . to know I was doing the right thing by giving him a chance. ‘Not knowing how long he would live . meant we were determined to enjoy him for as long as we could. We . learned he loved the shower and would kick when I sprayed the water on . my tummy. ‘As he grew bigger I could see his . little feet and hands prodding through my bump when he wriggled. He may . not have been born but he was already our son and I took each movement . as a sign we had done the right thing. ‘I would talk to him and play him music because I wanted him to experience as much as possible.’ Because of her son’s disabilities he . couldn’t swallow the amniotic fluid surrounding him meaning Kaytia had . to undergo painful draining procedures for the last nine weeks of her . pregnancy. She said: ‘It was agony and I knew . some people questioned if it was worth putting myself through all this . for a severely disabled baby that may not live for long. ‘But I never ever thought like that. As a mother you will do anything for your child and for me I became a . mother as soon as I fell pregnant, that job had started already.’ And for Katyia the rewards for her . pregnancy were she says the most joyful and fulfilling nine hours of her . life – the time she spent with her son. - Mother Katyia Rowe . He was delivered after being induced . when her waters went on October 23rd last year at the Royal Shrewsbury . hospital and as expected was rushed straight to special baby care for . his condition to be assessed. She says: ‘I was prepared not to be . taking our baby straight home like all the other new parents, but beyond . that I didn’t know what the future held.’ But shortly after the birth midwives burst into the delivery suite and warned Katyia her son had just minutes to live. She says: ‘I was shocked but we had . already decided that after his birth we would let Lucian lead the way. I . didn’t want him given any unnecessary treatment if ultimately it . wouldn’t help him. 'He had already given me the greatest . honour of being his mummy for the last nine months. It was up to him . now if he was ready to go.’ Katyia rushed to his side and finally the son she had nurtured for nine months was placed in her arms. She said: ‘It was without doubt the happiest . moment of my life. Lucian could have died at anytime in my womb but he . held on long enough for us to meet properly. ‘My son looked utterly perfect. ‘The love and joy I felt the moment they put Lucian in my arms told me it had all been worth it.’ She added: ‘I thought I didn’t want . to be a mother but Lucian taught me it is the most wonderful job in the . world and I will always be grateful for that.’ Before his death he was held in his mother's arms and he even met his grandparents.

"The suit against Michael Jackson’s concert promoter by the late singer’s family may soon reveal the biological father of his three young children after years of speculation. Filed against AEG, the company behind Jackson’s ill-fated ‘This Is It’ tour, the suit includes all three of the icon’s children as well as his mother Katherine and alleges the company contributed to Jackson’s death by pushing him to work too hard ahead of the tour and by hiring the doctor responsible for giving Jackson the drugs that killed him. As part of the trial’s potential award phase, AEG is prepared to present to the court evidence that, despite Jackson’s claims, only one of the children is the King of Pop’s biological child. Michael's? A suit filed by Michael Jackson's family may answer the question of who fathered Paris, Prince, and Blanket . According to a New York Post report, that child is the youngest of the bunch, 10-year-old Blanket. A plea to the judge in the case from Jackson’s family says it doesn’t matter, however. They have begged her not to allow AEG to include biological evidence of the children’s parentage in the case, arguing it is irrelevant and only a means of damaging the family reputation. But AEG maintains that Jackson’s claim that he fathered all the children himself is part of a bigger pattern. Origins: Paris, 15 (left), and Prince, 16 (right), likely know Debbie Rowe is their mom, but a new report alleges Michael is definitely not their dad . ‘There was a whole lot that Michael Jackson or his family wasn’t and isn’t being forthcoming about,’ said the Post’s source at AEG . ‘The drug use by Jackson, his use of alcohol, his relationship with his own family, and the identities of the children’s parents.’ Michael Jackson died in June 2009 after his personal doctor Conrad Murray administered a dose of the anaesthetic propofol that proved deadly for the singer. In the suit against AEG, the family claims the concert company failed to properly vet Murray, who they hired on behalf of Jackson. Though the biological origins of the Jackson children remain a mystery on the father’s side, many agree on who their mothers are. Paris, 15, and Prince, 16, for instance, have a mother in former Jackson nurse Debbie Rowe. And many take as fact the assertion that Blanket’s mother is an unnamed San Diego-area Hispanic woman. Young Michael: Prior to Michael Jackson's (left) plastic surgeries, many say he looked a lot like son Blanket (right) and a new report alleges 10-year-old Blanket is Jackson's only biological legacy . If AEG’s claims are true, though, Paris and Prince could have fathers among an assemblage of men. Jackson’s former dermatologist Arnold Klein, has said he is the biological father of both Paris and Prince. A former Jackson bodyguard named Matt Fiddes asked for a DNA test to prove that he’s father to sapphire-eyed Paris shortly after Jackson’s death and former child star Mark Lester has said he, too, may be Paris’s father. As people take bets on who fathered the older children, no one seems to be refuting AEG’s supposed allegations about Blanket. ‘Blanket looks just like him,’ a Jackson family member told the New York Post. ‘There is no doubt that he is Michael’s.’","Only one of the three Jackson children can claim Michael's DNA, say sources in a new report .
The King of Pop maintained he was the father of Prince, Paris, and Blanket but a company the Jacksons are suing for $40M says that was one of many family lies ."
"Studying for a PhD in engineering at Cambridge, she might not seem like  a prime candidate to  enter into a polygamous marriage. But that is what Nabilah Phillips did, dropping out of university to become the second woman married to businessman Hasan Phillips who has since acquired a third wife. Yesterday it emerged that Mrs Phillips, from North London, is among thousands of Muslim women entering into such relationships which are illegal in the UK but allowed under sharia law which permits men to have four wives. Scroll down for video . Nabilah Phillips dropped out of Cambridge to become one of three women married to businessman and charity worker Hasan Phillips, 32 . Hasan Phillips and his three wives Nabilah 35, Sakinah 33, and Anub 41. Having already been through a divorce, Nabilah, originally from Malaysia, signed up to a similar matrimony service specifically looking for a married man . Hasan Phillips and his three wives Nabilah 35, Sakinah 33, and Anub 41 . Channel 4 . A new television documentary, The Men with Many Wives, exposes the rise in these unions – of which there are believed to be as many  as 20,000 in Britain – and the dating agency, Muslim Marriage Event, responsible for setting many of them up. The couple were interviewed in this week's Radio Times . Having already been through a divorce Mrs Phillips, 35, originally from Malaysia, signed up to a similar matrimony service specifically looking for a married man. She told the programme: ‘I  was looking for someone who  had been married or was already in a marriage. ‘I was married before and having gone through one divorce, you kind of know what you want in marriage, so I wanted someone who already knows how to be a husband. ‘I really enjoy being in a polygamous relationship. We are not stupid people who are forced into this type of relationship.’ Through the service she signed up to she met 32-year-old Mr Phillips – also divorced but re-married to City worker Sakinah, 33, – and decided to abandon her studies to become his second wife. The wives occasionally meet when Mr Phillips, who as well as being a businessman also works for a charity aiming to spread the word of Islam, organises family outings. Nabilah Phillips said: ‘If any problem happens between co-wives it’s usually his fault. Praising somebody too much. “Why don’t you be more like her, she’s this, she’s that”. If he didn’t say that, we would all be happy.’ She has two children with Mr Phillips, who has six in total, and helps to run his import-export business. But abandoning her high-flying academic career was not her only change after she married. She  also began wearing the Muslim veil, the niqab. She told Radio Times: ‘I wanted to wear one before I got married – being married to Hasan has given me the opportunity to wear one and be steady at it. The only prejudice I have met so far has been from other Muslims.’ Nabilah has two children with Mr Phillips - who has six in total - and now helps run his import-export business. But abandoning her academic career was not her only change after she married. She also began wearing the Muslim veil, the niqab . During filming Mr Phillips, who converted to Islam from Christianity when he was 16, marries a third woman, Somalia-born Anub, 41. He did not invite his other two wives to the small ceremony, held at the local mosque, saying: ‘I don’t think it would be right to invite them. Even though they are accepting of polygamy, you don’t want to really rub it in their faces, “Look, I’m getting married”, and expect them to be happy and have a party about it.’ Each wife lives in a separate house in London and Mr Phillips spends three nights in each home before moving on to the next. The programme, to be broadcast at 10pm next Wednesday on Channel 4, also speaks to Mizan Raja, who claims to have more than 50,000 clients on the books of Muslim Marriage Event, which appears to facilitate polygamous marriages. He said the popularity of such arrangements is driven by the women who are having difficulty finding a husband, and admits that while these women are looking for security, many of the men have baser motives. He said: ‘Most men who want to do polygamy, probably 80 per cent, it’s a sexually driven thing.’","Nabilah Phillips dropped out of Cambridge to marry Hasan Phillips .

"A former prosecutor who says Tawana Brawley, now known as Tawana Gutierrez, falsely dragged his name through the mud in a defamation judgment from 1987 is looking to collect this year. Steven Pagones, a former Dutchess County prosecutor, says Brawley still owes him . $429,000, including interest, after falsely calling him a 'gang-raping, kidnapping racist.' 'In all these years, she’s never told the truth about this hoax or paid me a cent,' Pagones told the New York Post on Christmas Eve. 'Now I’m going to seek anything I’m entitled to under the law,' he said. 'In all these years, she’s never told the truth about this hoax or paid me a cent,' says former assistant district attorney Steven Pagones . That could well cost Brawley, a single mom working as a nurse in . Virginia, up to a couple of hundred dollars a week, according to the Post. Twenty-five years after Brawley's claims of being raped by a gang of white men polarised New York City, the woman has been tracked down living in hiding in Virginia. On November 28, 1987, the then-15-year-old was found in a trash bag, dazed, smeared with feces with the word n****r scrawled on her body. She told police she had been abducted by . two white men and driven to the woods where they and four others . ravaged her for four days - one of which had a badge. Here to collect: Pagones says he would consider dropping his demand for money if Brawley admits she made up her story against him . The case was catapulted onto the national stage by attorneys Alton H. Maddox and C. Vernon Mason, and the then-little-known Rev. Al Sharpton, who claimed she was raped 33 times. Celebrities weighed in, with Bill Cosby posting a $25,000 reward for information on the case, Don King promised $100,000 for Brawley’s education and boxer Mike Tyson gave her a $30,000 watch to ease her pain. Fishkill Police Officer Harry Crist Jr. was implicated after being found dead in his apartment a week after Brawley was discovered, and Pagones was also accused when he stepped in with an alibi for the 28-year-old. But in 1988 a grand jury found the whole shocking story was a hoax, and Brawley was never raped. Now 40 years old, The New York Post tracked her down working as a nurse in Virginia. 'I don't want to talk to anyone about that,' Brawley told the newspaper recently as she emerged from her apartment in Hopewell, Virginia, wearing scrubs. Racial tensions: Rev Al Sharpton catapulted the case of Tawana Brawley, center, onto the main stage and made him a household name across the country . Historic case: Reverend Al Sharpton, pictured in 1988, picketed outside the hotel of New York governor Mario Cuomo . She lives what appears to be a relatively normal life in a neatly kept brick apartment complex with signs warning of video surveillance cameras. To avoid detection, Brawley goes by the aliases of Thompson and Gutierrez and has a young daughter, a neighbor told the Post. She reportedly works as a licensed practical nurse at The Laurels of Bon Air in Richmond. But her co-workers have been in the dark about the incredible story of brutality, which turned out to be false. 'Are you serious? We don't know her by that name. Isn't that a trip?' one staffer said, adding that the woman who they call Tawana Gutierrez was 'a good worker.' According to a neighbor, Brawley has lived in Hopewell - Virginia's most crime-laden town - for at least a year. 'Tawana V. Gutierrez' and 'Tawana V. Thompson' have held the same nursing license since 2006, state records show. The Virginia Board of Nursing confirmed issuing it to a 'Tawana Vacenia Thompson Gutierrez.' False claims: Brawley, pictured in 1988, claimed she was gang raped by a group of white men, one of whom had a badge . Rally: Tawana Brawley, left in 1988, of Wappinger Falls, N.Y., was the center of the legal controversy over her rape charges . Brawley maintains a PO box in Claremont, Va., under the name Gutierrez, according to The Post's sources. The grand jury panel, which heard from 180 witnesses over its seven-month investigation, found that Brawley made up the story to avoid being punished for staying out late and missing school. They found evidence she had ran away from home and was hiding out in her parents' former apartment after they got evicted. Many believed that Brawley feared her stepdad Ralph King's and needed an alibi for her absence. King spent seven years in prison in the 1970s for killing his first wife. Traces of the charcoal-like material used to scrawl the hateful word on her body were found under her fingernails, and she showed no signs of genital trauma or exposure, the jury found. One witness said Brawley was spotted climbing into the bin bag. We believe you: The case polarised New York City in the late 1980s . Lawsuit: Brawley, pictured in 1997, spoke at a rally in support of Alton Maddox who lost a lawsuit for defamation of character by Steven Pagones . 'It is probable that in the history of this state, never has a teenager turned the prosecutorial and judicial systems literally upside down with such false claims,' state Supreme Court Justice S. Barrett Hickman wrote at the time. Pagones has tried to forget the sorry affair but says he can't. 'It'll come up randomly. It'll come up when something happens with Sharpton,' he told The Post. Pagones won a defamation lawsuit against Sharpton, Brawley and her lawyers in 1998. Maddox was found liable for $97,000, Mason for $188,000, and Sharpton was ordered to pay $66,000. Brawley was ordered to pay $190,000 at 9 per cent annual interest but hasn't paid any of that bill. In total, she owes $429,000. He continues to look for her. 'Through her silence, she's as guilty of libel as Maddox, Mason and Sharpton,' he told the newspaper. 'The only way to hold her accountable — at least at this stage — is financially.'","Steven Pagones, a former assistant district attorney, says Brawley 'never told the truth about this hoax or paid me a cent'

"A High Court family judge who divorced after committing adultery with a younger woman called yesterday for the abolition of the legal rights and responsibilities of marriage. Sir Nicholas Mostyn, 57, said that there was no difference between the relationships of married and unmarried couples, and condemned the divorce system that gives special protection to wives. ‘It is not the role of the state, in my humble opinion, to go round telling people how they should form their relationships,’ he said. Sir Nicholas Mostyn, 57, said there was no evidence to suggest married relationship is more stable than cohabitation and condemned the divorce system that gives special protection to wives . He said state support for marriage was ‘social engineering’ and there was no evidence to show a married relationship is more stable than cohabitation. ‘I do not support two classes of adjudication depending on whether there happens to be a marriage,’ he said. ‘I support the extension of the existing system of judicial equitable distribution to the unmarried, warts and all.’ The judge, who sits as Mr Justice Mostyn, said there should be no difference in the way the courts treat the break-up of relationships of any kind. His own divorce came in 2012 after he walked out on his wife Lucy in 2010 to live with divorce barrister Elizabeth Saunders, 42. Mrs Saunders’s barrister husband Mark was shot dead by police marksmen during a siege off King’s Road in Chelsea in 2008. Sir Nicholas Mostyn left his wife for divorce barrister Elizabeth Saunders, above, in 2010 . During his less than amicable parting from his wife, Sir Nicholas was reported to have obtained an order to stop her speaking publicly about their break-up. However, his lawyers refused to say which court granted the order, or give any detail of its terms. Lady Mostyn refused and later told friends that the attempt to silence her amounted to ‘pathetic bullying’. The couple’s joint assets ran into millions of pounds. They had a Grade II-listed home in Little Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, with hundreds of acres. Sir Nicholas was until 2010 a divorce QC. Said to have earned up to £500 an hour, he represented clients including Sir Paul McCartney and Earl Spencer. His success on behalf of wives earned him the nickname Mr Payout. His views, delivered in a speech to a family law conference, come at a time of increasing pressure from senior judges for new laws to give cohabitees, and in particular women who are long-term unmarried partners, new legal rights when relationships break up. Sir James Munby, the judge who heads the Family Division, said last week that cohabitees should be protected by law, and married couples who want to divorce should no longer need to go to court. Sir Nicholas’s speech was aimed at Sir Paul Coleridge, the High Court family judge who stepped down this year amid a row over his launch of a think tank, the Marriage Foundation, aimed at rallying political support to strengthen the institution of marriage. Sir Nicholas said he did not agree with Sir Paul and added that marriage was already discriminated in favour of through the tax system. But researcher and author on the family Patricia Morgan said: ‘The judge is wrong to say there is discrimination in favour of marriage. ‘Marriage is discriminated against in the tax and benefit system. The only benefit is through inheritance, and couples who want to marry are not thinking about that – it is way down the line.’ And Harry Benson, research director of the Marriage Foundation, accused Sir Nicholas of saying that ‘marriage doesn’t matter’. In 2011 Earl Spencer dropped a legal action against Sir Nicholas, who represented him in his 2009 divorce, and whom the earl blamed for his loss of £1million in the settlement. During the row Earl Spencer revealed that Sir Nicholas had told him that he had named seven piglets on his farm after Sir James Munby, the judge in the case. Sir Nicholas named his piglets James, Munby, Self-regarding, Pompous, Publicity, Seeking and Pillock.","Family judge Sir Nicholas Mostyn, 57, divorced wife after committing adultery .

"Lisa Egersdorf is accused of taking her son on a drive-by shooting so he could attack a rival gang . A mother has been accused of driving her son to a convenience store so he could shoot at rival gang members he had been fighting with at school. Prosecutors said Lisa Egersdorf, 36, picked up her 17-year-old son from his school in Salt Lake City, Utah, and was behind the wheel when he fired several shots at the group. Egersdorf asked, 'Did you get them?' after he fired six rounds at the group on September 22, charging documents showed. One of the shots hit a woman's car outside the 7-Eleven store, in the Millcreek area of the city, but no one was injured. Her son Damian Garcia and his friends got into Egersdorf's Toyota Corolla in the school parking lot after the fight. Police said that Garcia yelled: 'Mom, they just jumped me.' She replied: It's all right, we're going to get them.' Egersdorf later told investigators that she and her son are part of the same gang, police said. She accepted that she drove Garcia to the 7-Eleven but denied that the shots came from her car. The charges read: 'The next day [the woman] called police at their request and arranged for and [her son] to meet with them. '[She] claimed that there was another vehicle that she saw fire upon three gang members. When confronted about what witnesses had stated, [she] said, ""What am I supposed to do?""' Egersdorf was charged with 10 felonies and three counts of reckless endangerment. Garcia, who can be named as he is being prosecuted as an adult, was also charged with 10 felonies, including aggravated assault and six counts of firing a gun. Neither were available for comment.

"Amne Alrifai said Muslim women have become too frightened to leave their own homes . Muslims communities in Sydney have organised 'chaperoning services' for women on public outings after a rise in abuse and vandalism. They say there has been a rise in attacks since the anti-terror raids three weeks ago, as well as reports of Australians fighting for the Islamic State in recent months. There has been 30 attacks reported on Muslims because of their religion since the first anti-terror raids in Sydney on September 18, according to the Muslim Legal Network. Most of these attacks were on women wearing the traditional Muslim hijab, the organisation says. Now men are offering to step in and chaperone women wearing hijabs while they are out in public doing their shopping, during the school drop off and pick up, and escort them where they need to go to ensure their safety. The support is being organised through the Australian Non Muslims supporting Muslims Facebook group, which opened in September and already has more than 8000 members. On the Facebook page, the group said the rising trend of 'Islamaphobia and discrimination encountered every day by Muslims living in Australia is unacceptable.' A group member, Amne Alrifai, 23, who was born and raised in Liverpool in Sydney's south-west, said that Muslim women are facing so much aggression in Western Sydney that they are becoming too frightened to leave their own homes. 'The chaperoning has been required as a result of many reports of harassment from within the community,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for videos . Amne Alrifai said her newsfeed has been rife with accounts of abuse and photographs of vandalised properties. This photograph was taken in Wentworthville, in western Sydney, on September 20 . 'Facebook was a hotbed of reports of harassment and women were starting to fear that they would be next. 'The men offering chaperoning services put the call out for everyone, but focused on women without a 'muhram' or male relative, so that they may accompany these ladies during their daily errands and to ease their fears. ‘They just want to live their lives peacefully and should not need chaperones to feel safe enough to do their shopping.’ The services are organised through a Facebook page called Australian Non Muslims supporting Muslims, which opened in September and has over 8000 members . The 23-year-old said her newsfeed has been rife with accounts of abuse and photographs of vandalised properties, with all sorts of terrible, disgusting messages being left on cars, homes and places of worship of Muslims. ‘People's cars and backyards have been spray painted, with some saying: ‘F**** MUSLIM’ and most of it is happening in the suburb where I spent most of my life growing up,’ she said. ‘Now, what would drive someone to do something so disgusting? ‘It is terrifying that these violent, angry bigots do not see that they are walking the same line that ISIS does. Muslims communities are organising chaperoning services for public outings after a rise of incidents of abuse and vandalism. This car was taken in Liverpool of Sydney's south-west . ‘Yes, there have not been any beheading's in the streets, but why should I have to be concerned for my safety in the streets of Australia because of my religious beliefs?’ Among recorded incidents, a Muslim women had her hijab pulled off her head and thrown to the ground at Casula Mall in Sydney’s south-west, which has left her feeling threatened. 'How is it that anyone can think it’s reasonable to react to violence perpetrated in the name of Islam by fighting innocent, Muslim women?’ she said. ‘I started receiving messages from people I barely know, asking me if I was okay because their Muslim friend had been hassled in the streets. ‘We shouldn’t have to be texting each other to see if we’re okay. We shouldn’t have to change the way we live our lives either.’ Another vandalised vehicle taken in Wentworthville of  west of Sydney - taken on September 20 . ‘I had never seen such a widespread affect. I mean, a few isolated incidents, sure. But almost everyone? Never. Ms Alrifai, who now lives in Canberra, said she is also mortified and concerned about the possibility of ‘young Muslim men falling into cult-like groups, such as ISIS’. ‘As an Australian Muslim, I’m mortified about the possibility of young Muslim men abandoning their Islamic teachings of love and kindness and falling within the folds of yet another terrorist organisation, threatening the world,' she said. ‘We, [Muslims of Australia] are under pressure and the worst thing to think about is that these people who have been charged are Australian. 'We need to have the support networks in place to identify when these youths are going down this path and prevent it from happening. ‘On the other hand, we’re trying to defend ourselves from bigots who don’t realise how similar they are to the ‘terrorists’. ‘These guys are the terrorists of Australia, and I denounce them in the same way I denounce ISIS. 'I fear them as much as I fear ISIS. They are just as much a threat to my personal safety and security as ISIS – if not moreso. They are in my backyard. ‘It’s terrifying, and I feel sorry for the parents of these men. If I’m feeling this broken, I can’t imagine how they’re feeling now. Ms Alrifai moved to Canberra two years ago and said she has never had to deal with any racism or discrimination in the nation’s capital. ‘In fact, sometimes I forget that I wear a hijab. But Liverpool will always be home, as inglorious a place as it can be,’ she said. 'This picture of my colleague and I on the day she wore a hijab to work to support Muslim women . Ms Alrifai said the media coverage of ‘terrorism’ at the moment is overwhelming but what makes it different this time is that it’s a threat on Australian soil. 'What we need is more coverage about the acts of support and unity and the overwhelming amount of good contributed to Australia by Muslims. 'People who commit crimes against Australian Muslims should be made to feel that they are the unwelcome minority in the public’s opinion, not the other way around. ‘Acts of violence committed by someone claiming to be Muslim is so often reported as ‘terrorism’, has become a word that has lost all meaning. ‘We’re just the same as everyone else and we’re just as outraged by the idea of violence in our country.’ Amne Alrifai, 23, who was born and raised in Liverpool, said that Muslim women have faced so much aggression in Western Sydney; they have become too frightened to leave their own homes . She said the increased violence against Muslims is counter-productive and has created a further divide between the Muslim and non-Muslim community. ‘I would never claim that all Muslims are perfect, or that the Islamic community is doing everything possible to identify and prevent the radicalisation of our youth. We have a lot left to do - we’re working on it. ‘What I know for a fact is that we find ISIS to be just as terrifying and abhorrent as the rest of the world. We are just as worried about what the future holds.’ Ms Alrifai said she hopes to see a united Australia that appreciates that most Muslims just want to live normal lives and that they are all an important voice in this dialogue . Despite all the threats and concerns in the Muslim community, Ms Alrifai said she hopes to see a united Australia that appreciates that most Muslims just want to live normal lives and that they are all an important voice in this dialogue. ‘I’m hoping to a see a stronger Islamic community that is aware enough to prevent home-grown terrorism and resilient enough to ensure that the majority of Muslims, who are just normal people, feel safe and supported. ‘An Australia where non-Muslims can rest assured that they are safe. I want to see Australia where following a certain religion, coming from a particular culture, loving a particular person and being of a particular skin colour does not result in harassment. ‘I know I can’t speak for all Muslims, but I have spent the last week and a half fighting what feels like a losing battle on every front. ‘However, I am glad that the Islamic community is coming together to support each other. It's something we haven't been so good at in the past.' ‘Everything is going to be okay in the end, and if it’s not okay, it’s not the end.’ You can read more of Amne Alrifai's blog HERE. NSW .

"A maid in the United Arab Emirates who attempted to kill her employer's three children by scolding them with boiling water and attacking them with a cleaver while they slept has been jailed for life. The 25-year-old Ethiopian maid, referred to as Y.S., claimed she attacked the children, two girls and a boy aged 15, 14 and 10, because they and their mother had made threats against her own life. 'The four of them, the mother and the children, threatened to kill me,' she told the Dubai Criminal Court through a translator from the Ethiopian embassy.

She said her employer, a 42-year-old teacher, repeatedly accused her of stealing and refused to send her back to Ethiopia, claiming that her passport was missing. The eldest sister said the incident happened the same day her mother had to go away for medical treatment. She said: 'My sister and I were sleeping on one bed while our brother was sleeping on a mattress. 'Around 7am I felt some boiling water splashing on my face... I woke up shocked and saw the defendant. 'She held a boiler and a cleaver in her hands. She stabbed me repeatedly in my face, and then she attacked my sister and then my brother.

"The row over the cost of Britain’s police commissioners grew last night after a Mail on Sunday investigation found that more than a dozen of them have appointed deputies on wages  of up to £68,000. Just weeks after the £75 million vote  that saw a record low turnout for  a national election, a third of the crime chiefs are giving jobs to councillors, magistrates and former police officers to help them in their roles. Some are being paid £68,000 a year – more than backbench MPs earn and almost enough to pay for three constables, who start on £23,500. Third paid role: Yvonne Mosquito, left, will be paid £65,000 for a 32-hour working week by West Midlands PCC Bob Jones, right, and continue to receive £27,000 for two other council jobs . The new unelected jobs are being created even though police and crime commissioners (PCCs) have offices full of staff from the Police Authorities they replaced. They do not have to advertise the posts and many have handed them to friends and political allies. It has raised concerns that the PCCs, who themselves earn up to £100,000  a year, are not as accountable as they were meant to be – and are wasting cash that could be spent on frontline services to catch criminals.

PCCs, who set budgets and priorities, have just one pot of money to spend on their own offices and the force they govern, totalling almost  £8 billion a year nationwide. The more they spend on their staff, the less they will have for frontline police. All 41 PCCs will meet for the first time tomorrow when they travel  to the Home Office to see Theresa May, the Home Secretary, and Damian Green, the Policing Minister.

"The most popular boys' name in England and Wales last year was Muhammad, according to an ONS poll released earlier today.

"This is the moment an alleged sniper and member of the pro-government forces was beaten by anti-government protestors in Kiev, as protestors took control of the presidential administration building. As Ukrainian protesters said they had . taken control of government offices and President Viktor Yanukovich fled the city, angry civilians kicked and shouted at members of the government, and could be seen tussling with an alleged sniper. 'He's (Yanukovich) not here, none of his officials or anyone linked directly to the . administration are here,' Ostap Kryvdyk, a protest leader inside the . grounds of the administration building, said.

An alleged sniper and member of the pro-government forces is beaten by anti-government protestors in Kiev . The regime of Ukraine's president appeared close to collapse on February 22 as the emboldened opposition took control of central Kiev . The opposition has taken control of key government and parliament positions and voted to immediately free its jailed leader Yulia Tymoshenko . An alleged sniper has a crucifix shoved in his face as a crowd grabs him. Thousands have people have swarmed Kiev's streets as their president has allegedly fled the country . The turmoil in Ukrainian parliament comes as former prime minister and opposition icon Yulia Tymoshenko has been released from prison. Protesters in the Ukrainian capital claimed full control of the city Saturday following the signing of a Western-brokered peace deal aimed at ending the nation's three-month political crisis. They were seen demanding the resignation of their president and attacking politicians, a move which Mr Yanukovych branded 'a coup' and likened it to the rise of Nazis in the 1930s. Viktor Yanukovych also says he has no intention of resigning or leaving the country. Hours after he and opposition leaders signed an agreement aimed at resolving the country's turmoil yesterday, Mr Yanukovych went to Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, the heartland of his support. Today, he made the coup accusation in a televised statement. The opposition has demanded a new election be held by May 25, as the pro-Russian leader's grip on power rapidly eroded following bloodshed in the capital. The nation's embattled president, Viktor Yanukovych, reportedly had fled the capital for his support base in Ukraine's Russia-leaning east. Ukraine's border guard service said that a leading governor and a mayor from the president's eastern base have fled to Russia. A spokesman for the border guard service, Oleh Slobodyan, said Kharkiv regional governor Mikhaylo Dobkin and Kharkiv Mayor Hennady Kernes left Ukraine across the nearby Russian border. Both are top allies of President Viktor Yanukovych, whose rule appeared increasingly under question after protesters took over the capital and parliament voted to remove him. There are fears that Ukraine might split in two, creating a Russian-leaning east and Europe-leaning west. Police abandoned posts around the capital, and protesters took up positions around the presidential office and residence. Parliament discussed voting on impeaching Yanukovych and setting a quick date for new elections to end a crisis over Ukraine's identity and future direction.

But . despite the promise of an election and significant concessions, . protesters blame him for police violence and amassing too many powers . and want him ousted immediately. At . a special parliament session today, Oleh Tyahnybok, head of the . nationalist Svoboda party, called for discussion of impeachment. The parliament speaker — Yanukovych ally Volodymyr Rybak — announced resignation, citing ill health as the reason. The . president's representative in parliament warned against splitting the . country in two, an outcome that worries many but is increasingly seeming . a possibility. The country's western regions want to be . closer to the EU and have rejected Yanukovych's authority in many . cities, while eastern Ukraine — which accounts for the bulk of the . nation's economic output — favors closer ties with Russia.

It was the worst violence in Ukraine's modern history. Andriy Parubiy, a leader of the protest camp on Independence Square, known as the Maidan, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying that Yanukovych fled for Kharkiv, the center of Ukraine's industrial heartland. Kharkiv was the capital of Soviet Ukraine from 1919-1934. The claims of the president's departure could not be immediately confirmed, however. A group of protesters in helmets and shields stood guard at the president's office today, with few police in sight.

A motion seeking the president's impeachment was submitted late Friday to the Ukrainian parliament, where members of Yanukovych's faction defected in droves to the opposition side, quickly passing constitutional amendments that trimmed his powers. It wasn't clear if or when the impeachment motion would be put to a vote. The standoff between the government and protesters escalated this week, as demonstrators clashed with police and snipers opened fire in the worst violence the country has seen since the breakup of the Soviet Union a quarter-century ago. The Health Ministry put the death toll at 77 and some opposition figures said it's even higher. The U.S., Russia and the 28-nation EU are deeply concerned about the future of Ukraine, a divided nation of 46 million. The parliament on Friday quickly approved a measure that could free Yanukovych's arch-rival Tymoshenko, who has served two and a half years on a conviction of abuse of office, charges that domestic and Western critics have denounced as a political vendetta. Legislators voted to decriminalize the count under which Tymoshenko was imprisoned, meaning that she is no longer guilty of a criminal offense. However, Yanukovych must still sign that bill into law, and then Tymoshenko's lawyers would have to ask the court for her release from prison in Kharkiv, the city controlled by Yanukovych's loyalists where the opposition has little public following.

"A baffled coroner has ruled that a man who burned to death in his home died as a result of spontaneous human combustion. Dr Ciaran McLoughlin, the coroner for West Galway in Ireland, said that although Michael Faherty, 76, had been found lying on his back close to a fire in an open fireplace, that blaze had NOT caused his death. He said a detailed investigation into all other possibilities had offered no other explanation, so he was delivering such a verdict for the first time in his 25 years as a coroner. Death: The home in Ballybane, Galway, where Michael Faherty spontaneously combusted in his sitting room . It is believed to be the first case of its kind in Ireland, although a number of unexplained cases are reported each year around the world. The term spontaneous human combustion (SHC) describes alleged cases of the burning of a living human body without an apparent external source of ignition. Mr Faherty, of Ballybane, Galway, died on 22 December 2010. The inquest was told that forensic experts were certain that a fire in the fireplace of the sitting room where the badly burnt body was found had not been the cause of the blaze that killed him. Wife Maureen Faherty, right, arrives at Galway Coroner Court today with Assistant Chief Fire Office Gerard O Malley . There had been no trace of an accelerant, such as petrol or alcohol, and there had been nothing to suggest foul play. There have been a number of documented cases where police have found corpses burned almost to ashes but no burned furniture around them.Temperatures of 3,000 degrees would be required to burn a human body to this extent, yet in these cases only smoke damage is reported.Puzzled scientists have come up with the ‘wick theory’ to explain such events. The theory is that the human body can become an ‘inside out’ candle.The person’s clothes are the wick, while their body fat is the wax or flammable substance, that keeps the blaze going. Limbs may be left intact because of the temperature gradient, with the bottom half of the bodybeing cooler than the top.A grisly aside is that greasy stains left after such an event could be a residue for the person’s body fat.The combustion would not be ‘spontaneous’ however, because it would need an external source to start it off, such as a cigarette. Some have postulated that static electricity could cause the needed spark.Home Office pathologist Professor Michael Green told the BBC in 2005: ‘The way the body burns - the so-called wick effect - seems to me and to my colleagues to be the most scientifically credible hypothesis.’A body would take around five hours to burn in this way to ashes. Victims are often elderly, sick, or under the influence of alcohol, which might explain why they would not have been able to escape. While his body was totally destroyed by fire, it had not spread and the only minor damage in the sitting room was to the ceiling above him and the floor beneath him. Dr McLoughlin said he had consulted medical textbooks and carried out other research in an attempt to find an explanation. 'This fire was thoroughly investigated and I'm left with the conclusion that this fits into the category of spontaneous human combustion, for which there is no adequate explanation,' he said. Mr Faherty's daughter Mairin said her family was satisfied with the investigation and they accepted the inquest's findings. However, she added: 'Unfortunately, it doesn't provide us with any real explanation.' Claims about SHC have been made for centuries. The gin-drinking character Krook the alcoholic in  the Charles Dickens novel Bleak House is said to spontaneously combust. Relatives of a British woman who died in 1982 said they saw her burst into flames in her north London home but coroner Dr John Burton said there was 'no such thing' as SHC and recorded an open verdict. The human body is mostly water and its only properties which burn readily are fat tissue and methane gas. Temperatures of nearly 2,000F are required to reduce a body to near ashes. Many experts believe there is no such thing as SHC. Retired professor of pathology Mike . Green said he believed there always had to be some source of ignition, . such as a lit match or cigarette. 'There is a source of ignition somewhere, but because the body is so badly destroyed the source can't be found,' he said. He said the circumstances in the Galway case were very similar to other possible cases. Truth stranger than fiction: An illustration from Charles Dickens' Bleak House of the moment Krook dies from spontaneous combustion - the fate which befell Michael Faherty in West Galway . 'This is the picture which is described time and time again,' he said. Mr Green said he doubted explanations centred on divine intervention. 'I think if the heavens were striking in cases of spontaneous combustion then there would be a lot more cases. I go for the practical, the mundane explanation,' he said.","Coroner records first ever case in Ireland .

"A man had to be rescued after he became impaled on an ornamental headboard in a freak accident in Australia - but it took emergency workers 90 minutes to free him. Paramedics were called to the 60-year-old man's home in Reid, a suburb of Australian capital Canberra after he became impaled through his stomach. He was freed by fire crews from the Australian Capital Territory Fire & Rescue service and local police officers - but not before he had been stuck in the agonising position for an hour-and-a-half. Agony: The freak accident which saw a 60-year-old man impaled through the stomach on an ornamental headboard happened in the Reid suburb of Canberra, Australia . He was rushed to Canberra Hospital where he is said to be in a serious but stable condition following the incident which happened on Sunday. It is unclear how the man came to be impaled on the headboard. The Australian man is not the only one who had a lucky escape after becoming impaled in an accident in 2012. Earlier this month a Chinese man who tried to use a hydraulic pressure spindle to barbecue a sheep ended up with a metal bar impaled through his abdomen when it exploded. It took two hours of surgery to remove the bar from the man's stomach. Also in December, another Chinese man almost blinded himself in one eye after impaling it on a giant metal hook. Wang Chenggen was using the rusty hook to pick up rubbish when he slipped and fell face first onto it. The bizarre accident happened in Harbin, in China's Heilongjiang Province. Meanwhile, closer to home in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, a pensioner was impaled through the chest on a metal table leg and had to be freed by firefighters.

"Convicted: Gang member Johnson Olayinka was convicted of trafficking a 23-year-old Nigerian woman into the UK for sexual exploitation . Three members of an international prostitution ring that smuggled a Nigerian woman into the UK to work as a sex slave under the threat of a voodoo curse are facing jail today. The gang conned the innocent 23-year-old into flying to Heathrow Airport on a bogus passport with the promise of education, a job and a new home. Before leaving Nigeria, she was raped and forced to go through a black magic ‘juju’ death ritual to prevent her running away. But when the woman arrived in London, her employment failed to materialise. Instead, she was told she was destined to work as a sex slave in Italy, a court heard. The plan was only thwarted when Italian authorities spotted her forged ID and sent her back to the UK. It is believed the woman is just one of many victims of the group, based in Africa, that trafficks young women through England to work as prostitutes in mainland Europe. Olusoji Oluwafemi, 44, Johnson Olayinka, 45, and Florence Obadiaru, 48, were convicted of trafficking the woman into the UK for sexual exploitation and arranging for her transfer to Italy. Oluwafemi and Olayinka were also found guilty of conspiring to get the woman a false passport. Oluwatosin Osoba, 48, was acquitted of the same charge following a trial at the Old Bailey. Judge Rebecca Poulet said custody is inevitable and sentence was adjourned until July 11. The victim, who only spoke a little English, had been recruited by a Nigerian local called Beneditta in her home village near Benin City. Her family had struggled financially since the death of her father in 2008, but she aspired to become a nurse. In February 2011, Beneditta offered to help the young woman by sending her to England to be educated properly and get a job, the court heard. She was told the cost would be £40,000 - which she would have to repay to the organisers. Prosecutor Christopher Ames told the court: ‘She had no idea at all what £40,000 was in her own currency, her life had been very hard after her father died, and she jumped at the chance to be educated and be trained for a job, and get away from the desperation and misery of her current family situation. ‘She was very excited, a naive young girl, at the prospect of going abroad.’ She was sent to the Nigerian capital of Lagos on March 23, 2011, to meet a man called Felis who made her a false passport and coached her in getting through UK immigration. ‘While he was doing that, he began to sexually assault her’, said Mr Ames. ‘That led him to beat her with a belt and that in turn led to him raping her that night.’ When she complained to Beneditta the next morning, she was told: ‘It was what you should have expected’. She was then told to pose for photos with a man who would pretend to be her husband. In September 2011 she was summoned to the west African country of Benin to get a visa. The woman was then told to swear an oath to repay the money in a ceremony that involved cutting her armpit and pubic hair and taking finger nail clippings. Guilty: Florence Obadiaru was also convicted for trafficking the woman. The court heard how the innocent girl was raped and forced to go through a voodoo ritual before coming to the UK . ‘The oath she was solemnly required to take was to repay that money, £40,000, on pain of death if she did not,’ said Mr Ames. ‘This was what was known as a juju ceremony.’ She was driven to Lagos on September 12, 2011 and put on a plane to the UK, meeting Olayinka at Heathrow Airport. Olayinka, calling himself ‘Mike’, checked her into the Marbella Hotel in Peckham, south London, and took away her money and passport. She was next taken to the house of Obadiaru, an old friend of Beneditta’s, and kept there for a few weeks with no sign of a job or education. Obadiaru’s son, who suffers from learning difficulties, groped her on the first night in the house in Brockley, southeast London. But when she complained, Obadiaru allegedly told her: ‘What do you think you are here for?’ The woman was told she was being sent to Italy on October 3, 2011, and collected another false passport from Olayinka’s home. ‘It was then for the first time that this very young girl from a small village in Africa, miles away from home, realised she was about to be sent to Italy to be forced into prostitution’, Mr Ames said. Sex slave: When the woman arrived in the UK, she was kept at a house in London before being told she was going to Italy, the Old Bailey (pictured) heard. Only then did she realise she was being sold in to prostitution . ‘She came to that gradual realisation, and she suddenly remembered hearing conversations between some men and their girls in Italy. ‘She couldn’t speak Italian and there was no question of her being able to work in Italy in the normal sense. ‘She became very upset and fearful of what awaited her.’ The gang’s plan was thwarted by Italian immigration officials, who stopped the woman on an obviously forged passport at Milan Airport and sent her straight back to the UK. After she was detained by immigration officials, the woman led them to the alleged identity factory in Osoba’s flat in South Bermondsey, southeast London, and laptops which had been used to make false documents by Olayinka. Mr Ames said the National Crime Agency launched Operation Visionary after quizzing the woman ‘to penetrate and stop the activities of an organised crime group based in Africa and here in England, which has as its aim the trafficking of vulnerable young women from Nigeria to European countries, including Italy and France for the purpose of prostitution’ Oluwafemi, of South Bermondsey, southeast London, Olayinka, of Peckham Rye, southeast London, and Obadiaru, of Brockley, south London denied conspiracy to traffic a person to the UK for the purpose of sexual exploitation, and conspiracy to traffic a person out of the UK for the purpose of sexual exploitation. Oluwafemi, Olayinka, and Osoba, of South Bermondsey, southeast London, denied conspiracy to commit an offence of possessing false identity documents.","Innocent 23-year-old from Nigeria promised education, job and home in UK .

"Madonna appeared to make a public apology to France's far-right nationalist leader Marine Le Pen last night after depicting the politician with a swastika across her forehead.

Backtracking: The pop star, pictured yesterday in Paris, issued what appeared to be an apology to the French nationalist leader . Madonna then went on to praise France for its tolerance and the welcome it had shown to black performers. She said: 'Before the civil rights movement in America, African American artists were not allowed to perform in America, but France opened its arms to Josephine Baker, Charlie Parker, to people of colour and people who were different. Minorities felt welcome in France. 'If we don't learn from history we will just repeat it. So the next time you want to point the finger at somebody and blame them for the problems in your life take that finger and point it back at you.' Despite her emotive words, there were boos when Madonna, who turns 54 in August, performed for just 45 minutes, after fans paid up to £200 to see her. Music to their ears: The 54-year-old announced that she 'did not want to make enemies' with a 'very angry' Marine Le Pen, right, and praised France for its tolerance and welcome it has shown to black performers . She also raised eyebrows when she said: 'I have a special affinity with France, and I have for many years. It could go all the way to Napoleon because I think of myself as a revolutionary.' The pop queen was attacked for only singing for around 30 minutes - and spending 15 minutes 'wittering on about politics'. As she left the stage, the curtains closed behind her with a message reading 'I love you'. But when she did not reappear for an encore, audience members began jeering, booing and pelting the stage with bottles. An image displayed by Madonna at a Paris concert earlier this month showed Ms Le Pen, 43, with the Nazi symbol super-imposed over her face . Ticket prices for the sold-out gig started at £60 rising to £200, but were exchanging hands on the black market for up to £1,000. Concert-goer Guillaume Delaval said afterwards: 'The show was OK but it only last 45 minutes, and she spent 15 minutes of that wittering on about politics and tolerance. 'We didn't come to hear that. It was a concert, not the United Nations.' Madonna's staff were not available for comment today on why she ended the gig so abruptly. The National Front has already lodged . a formal legal complaint on Madonna for the Nazi stunt, which she . pulled at another concert in Paris earlier this month. Florian . Philippot, the FN's vice-president, said the party could not accept . 'such an odious comparison', adding: 'This is just another provocation . in Madonna's world tour so that people will talk about her. High glamour: The National Front said the 54-year-old singer had displayed the provocative image in an effort to get people talking about her . 'Marine Le Pen will defend not only her own honour but her supporters and the millions of National Front voters.' Ms . Le Pen, 43, threatened prosecution when Madonna performed the same . stunt in Israel, saying: 'We understand how old singers who need to get . people talking about them go to such extremes.' Other sources in the National Front, which has frequently been linked with anti-Semitism and racism, said Madonna had offended all of its members. 'We are not a Nazi party, and object to being depicted as such,' said a source in the party, which won a fifth of the popular vote during the first round of presidential elections in April. 'If you accuse the National Front of being anti-Semitic and racist then you accuse a fifth of the French people of being anti-Semitic and racist.' Marine Le Pen pledged to reform the party after taking over the leadership from her notorious father, Jean-Marie Le Pen last year. He is a convicted racist and anti-Semite who has in the past denied that the Nazi Holocaust actually took place during World War II. Despite this, he came runner-up in the French presidential election in 2002, proving that he had widespread support. Ms Le Pen has toned down the party's extremist views, but regularly pledges to limit Muslim immigration, and to clamp down on Islamic culture in France. Madonna is well known for her provocative acts, and is currently dating a Frenchman called Brahim Zaibat who has a North African Muslim immigrant background. Ms Le Pen won just under 18 per cent of votes in the presidential election but failed in her bid to become an MP in France's National Assembly.","Leader of National Front is planning to sue the pop star .

"Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has revealed that UEFA restrictions on the size of his club's Champions League squad is likely to prevent him pushing for new signings this January. The transfer window opens on Saturday morning and some City fans are expecting Pellegrini to spend in a bid to strengthen his team in the absence of injured strikers Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko. But City's Champions League squad is restricted to 21 – rather than the usual 25 - as part their punishment for breaching Financial Fair Play regulations and Pellegrini hinted last night that this is likely to be a decisive factor. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini is unlikely to be signing new players in  January . Some City fans expected reinforcements for the injured Sergio Aguero (left) and Edin Dzeko (right) to come in . 'I think we are not thinking about the window,' said the City manager. 'We have the option. We will see players we can bring or sell or go on loan, but it is not our first important thing at this moment. 'We will see during January what will happen. 'But we have important restrictions about amount of money and restrictions on players we can put in our Champions League squad. 'So it's difficult to bring in a player when he cannot play in the Champions League.' City are functioning with just one frontline striker at the moment, Stevan Jovetic playing and scoring against Sunderland on New Years Day. Vincet Kompany has recovered from a hamstring injury but will be rested when City play Sheffield Wednesday . Frank Lampard (centre) scored City's winner as they beat Sunderland 3-2 at home on Thursday . However Pellegrini hopes Aguero and Dzeko will return in the next couple of weeks. 'I hope in the next week Edin Dzeko will be fit and in the next week will be Kun [Aguero],' added Pellegrini.

"The agency responsible for detaining and deporting illegal immigrants released more than 36,000 criminals living in the United States illegally last year, according to a new report. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency put rapists, murderers, kidnappers, dangerous drug dealers and other criminals who were in the process of being deported back on the streets the Center for Immigration Studies says. Many of the criminals had more than one conviction, CIS says, for a combined total of nearly 88,000 criminal convictions. U.S. Border Patrol and U.S. Air and Marine agents work together to detain illegal immigrant after chasing him down near the U.S.-Mexico border on April 11, 2013 near Mission, Texas . The Obama administration has earned a reputation for deporting more . illegal immigrants than its immediate predecessor. Since President Obama . took office close to two million illegal immigrants have been deported. Two-thirds of deportees have broken minor laws or no laws at, however, The New York Times reports. Only 20 percent illegal immigrants who are . deported commit violent crimes. 'We keep hearing from the administration that they are focused like a laser on enforcement against the worst of the worst, convicted criminals, as their top priority. On the other hand, they are releasing, at a rate of about 100 a day, aliens from their custody with criminal convictions, and many of them are serious criminal convictions,' CIS policy studies director Jessica M. Vaughan told the Washington Times. ICE arrested says it deported 216,810 criminal aliens in 2013 and arrested another 40,218. Based on CIS's report, ICE released the majority of the criminal aliens it arrested but did not deport. The Center for Immigration Studies report says ICE released 36,007 criminals who committed a combined total of 87,818 crimes in 2013. Of those, 17,228 convictions were for minor traffic violations and 15,635 came from DUIs. Other crimes were more serious, including . 9,187 dangerous drug convictions, 426 sexual assault convictions, 303 . kidnapping convictions, 193 homicide convictions, 1,317 domestic . violence convictions and 1,075 aggravated assault convictions. Some of these criminals were placed under supervision, others were not. CIS said it was unable to obtain the breakdown of how many illegal immigrants were unsupervised, supervised, placed on parole or received alternatives to detention such as tracking devices. ICE did not return the Washington Times' request for comment on the CIS report, but last year it blamed the looming sequester on a release of 622 immigrants. 'This is very hard for me to believe that they can’t find cuts . elsewhere in their agency,' House Speaker John Boehner said in response to ICE's actions. 'I frankly think this is outrageous.' House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte also criticized the decision. 'By releasing criminal immigrants onto the streets, the administration is needlessly endangering American lives,' he said at the time. The agency also said it had to let illegal immigrants go because did not have enough beds to hold all the people it was catching. Yet, two months ago ICE deputy director Daniel Ragsdale told a . House subcommittee that it would be requesting less money in 2015 for beds for detained illegal immigrants than it did the year before. The agency is reducing the number of beds at its facilities from 34,000 to 30,509 next year, he said. Ragsdale told members of the House Appropriations subcommittee on Homeland Security that the agency that it would focus 'costly detention capabilities on priority and mandatory detainees, while placing lower-risk, non-mandatory individuals in lower cost alternatives to detention programs.' 'ICE will work to realize continued efficiencies in detention operations to achieve this bed rate level,' he said. The Center for Immigration Studies questioned the timing of ICE's decision. 'The news that ICE . released so many criminal aliens convicted of so many serious and . violent crimes suggests that ICE could use more detention capacity, not . less, in order to prevent further harm to the public from these . individuals,' Vaughan writes in CIS' report. Public pressure over deportations seems to be at work, the report argues, noting that, 'A number of criminal aliens in detention while awaiting completion of . deportation proceedings have been the subject of petition campaigns, . prayer vigils, demonstrations, and other forms of protest against . enforcement.' 'Typically these protests occur on behalf of a criminal . alien who has family members in the United States. ICE should be asked . to disclose how many of these releases came after such appeals were made . on behalf of criminal aliens,' the report says.","A Center for Immigration Studies report .

"From supernatural strength to an unfortunate taste for human blood, vampires have long enjoyed a terrifying reputation. But according to a pair of real life British vampires Vanian, 53, and Ethereal Dark, 27, who both hail from Manchester, the reality of vampiric living is somewhat different. Although they do sleep during the day and drink blood, the married couple insist that they would never take it unasked ('That would be assault!' says an outraged Vanian). Scroll down for video . Acceptance: Vanian, 53, and Ethereal Dark, 27, want people to be more accepting of vampires . Myths: The couple are also keen to bust vampire myths, among them a dislike of garlic, churches and mirrors . Nocturnal: Although the couple can - and do - come out in the day, they prefer to 'honour the night' They also are happy to eat garlic, can get near a cross without mishap and even like churches, while fake fangs are a no-no. 'It's a myth that you can bite someone to get blood because that would be assault,' explains a wearily patient Vanian. 'You don't know whether they have infections either. 'We don't sleep in coffins - we don't even have a coffin. We don't walk around with fangs either; in fact, we don't have false fangs.' They do, however, enjoy a drop of blood or two with most coming from volunteers who have been dubbed 'Black Swans' by the vampire community, or from each other. 'Too much blood would make you vomit,' adds Vanian. 'It's not like in a film where it's dribbling down your chin. Your body tells you. 'It's personal too. It's always done one on one. We drink blood about twice a week but we do eat other food as well, especially red meat.' Vanian, who says he uses a little razor rather than fangs to extract blood from his wife, is at pains to point out that not just any blood will do. 'Black Swans have to get a health certificate or [drinking blood] is like Russian Roulette,' he continues. 'You don't know what they've got. Infections are everywhere. Also, we don't hack people up, that's not what we're about. Anyway, you'd be arrested if you did that.' Other vampiric myths that Vanian and Ethereal Dark are keen to quash include any suggestion that they can't enter churches and don't have a reflection. They also say that far from being forcibly turned into a vampire as shown in films and TV series such as True Blood, the process happens via what they describe as a 'gentle awakening'. 'It can happen at any age,' explains Vanian. 'It's a calling. A natural progression. You realise that you don't feel like everyone else. 'You start asking questions and waking up to who you really are. It's a way of looking inside yourself and yes, you do lose people when it happens. 'We're doing this interview to educate people,' he adds. 'It's your choice whether you believe in what we say or not.' Supper: The pair say they are happy to eat human food and only take blood from each other . Community: The couple run a group for fellow vampires and say there are many more than you might imagine . Given that the couple closely resemble goths and have little in the way of fictional vampires' supernatural powers, are they surprised that people question their credentials? 'We do encompass the gothic culture. and we may well look like gothic people. It's always been there with the culture, the music, the artwork,' ripostes Vanian. 'The vampire extends to goths but there are people in our community who have mainstream looks. It's not necessarily a look that everyone wants. There could be someone three seats down from you who is a vampire and you would never know about it.' Much like the 'normal' appearance of the vampires in True Blood and Twilight then, although Vanian says he's far from impressed by the latter. Good stuff: Vanian and Ethereal Dark are fans of True Blood which they say is - in some respects - accurate . Ridiculous: Twilight by contrast is well wide of the mark and bears little resemblance to the couple's lives . 'True Blood is very good but Twilight is not,' he says. 'No we don't sparkle. Again, it's not the true story. It's not my world.' Nevertheless, the couple say they would like more people in their world and hope that in time, people will become more accepting of their lifestyle. 'I'd like people to understand that we're real and that we're here to stay,' says Vanian. 'We're not horrible or evil and we want acceptance for what we are. 'Acceptance that there is a different way of living. People should be more open minded.'","Vanian, 53, and Ethereal Dark, 27, from Manchester say they are vampires .

"In this land of fire and ice, where the fog-shrouded lava fields offer a spooky landscape in which anything might lurk, stories abound of the 'hidden folk' - thousands of elves, making their homes in Iceland's wilderness. So perhaps it was only a matter of time before 21st-century elves got political representation. Elf advocates have joined forces with environmentalists to urge the Icelandic Road and Coastal Commission and local authorities to abandon a highway project building a direct route from the tip of the Alftanes peninsula, where the president has a home, to the Reykjavik suburb of Gardabaer. They fear disturbing elf habitat and claim the area is particularly important because it contains an elf church. Land of mystery: A highway connecting Gardabaer in Reykjavik to the Alftanes Peninsula in Iceland has been put on hold because of protests about the environmental and cultural impact - including affect it could have on local elves. Pictured is one of the few huts along the Laugavegur trail . The project has been halted until the Supreme Court of Iceland rules on a case brought by a group known as Friends of Lava, who cite both the environmental and the cultural impact - including the impact on elves - of the road project. The group has regularly brought hundreds of people out to block the bulldozers. And it's not the first time issues about 'Huldufolk', Icelandic for 'hidden folk', have affected planning decisions. They occur so often that the road and coastal administration has come up with a stock media response for elf inquiries, which states in part that 'issues have been settled by delaying the construction project at a certain point while the elves living there have supposedly moved on'. Scandinavian folklore is full of elves, trolls and other mythological characters. Most people in Norway, Denmark and Sweden haven't taken them seriously since the 19th century, but elves are no joke to many in Iceland, which has a population of 320,000. A survey conducted by the University of Iceland in 2007 found that some 62 per cent of the 1,000 respondents thought it was at least possible that elves exist. Ragnhildur Jonsdottir, a self-proclaimed 'seer', believes she can communicate with the creatures through telepathy. 'It will be a terrible loss and damaging both for the elf world and for us humans,' said Jonsdottir of the road project. The Supreme Court of Iceland will rule on whether the highway project should go ahead after Friends of Lava protested against the plans . Though many of the Friends of Lava are motivated primarily by environmental concerns, they see the elf issue as part of a wider concern for the history and culture of the very unique landscape. Andri Snaer Magnason, a well-known environmentalist, said his major concern was that the road would cut the lava field in two, among other things, destroying nesting sites. 'Some feel that the elf thing is a bit annoying,' said Magnason, adding that personally he was not sure they existed. However, he added: 'I got married in a church with a god just as invisible as the elves, so what might seem irrational is actually quite common' with Icelanders. Terry Gunnell, a folklore professor at the University of Iceland, said he was not surprised by the wide acceptance of the possibility of elves. 'This is a land where your house can be destroyed by something you can't see (earthquakes), where the wind can knock you off your feet, where the smell of sulfur from your taps tells you there is invisible fire not far below your feet, where the northern lights make the sky the biggest television screen in the world, and where hot springs and glaciers `talk,' Gunnell said. 'In short, everyone is aware that the land is alive, and one can say that the stories of hidden people and the need to work carefully with them reflects an understanding that the land demands respect.' Gunnell said similar beliefs are found in western Ireland, but they thrive in Iceland because people remain in close contact with the land. Parents still let their children play out in the wilderness - often late into the night. Vast pristine areas remain, even near the capital, Reykjavik. Pristine: There are still vast, untouched areas of land in Iceland, even near the capital Reykjavik, which is believed to be one of the reasons many residents still believe in ancient folklore . And at Christmas, Icelanders await not just one Santa Claus, but 13 trolls known as the 'Yule Lads' who come to town during the 13 days before Christmas, each with his own task, putting rewards or punishments into the shoes of little children. They include Stufur, or Stubby, who is extremely short and eats crusts left in pans; Pottaskefill, or Pot-Scraper, who snatches leftovers; and Hurdaskellir or Door-Slammer, who likes to slam doors at night. 'If you ask an Icelander about elves, they might say they don't believe,' said Jonsdottir. 'But we always have stories of them, if not from ourselves then from someone close like a family member. Of course, not everyone believes in the stories, but the stories and the elves are still there and being told.' Hilmar Gunnarsson, a writer in Reykjavik, fondly remembers a story his grandmother told him about a mischievous elf. 'She told me about (a pair) of her scissors that went missing and she was certain that an elf borrowed them,' Gunnarsson said. 'She would not believe that they were just lost and she would not buy (new) scissors. She said the elf would give them back when he was finished. She said they were returned.' One of Iceland's most famous daughters, the singer Bjork, had no hesitation in responding when asked by U.S. comedian and TV host Stephen Colbert if people in her country believed in elves. 'We do,' she said. 'It's sort of a relationship with nature, like with the rocks. (The elves) all live in the rocks, so you have to. It's all about respect, you know.'","Friends of Lava are campaigning against the new road from the Alftanes peninsular to Gardabaer in Reykjavik .

"He is the billionaire bondage fanatic fanning the flames of lust in women across the globe. A large part of Christian Grey's allure no doubt comes from the fact that readers are able to conjure up their very own fantasy figure as they read the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy. But now, as plans for a Hollywood version of Fifty Shades get underway and casting begins for the man who will play this most sensational of roles, thoughts have turned to just what this magnetic mystery male should look like. The face of Christian Grey? An academic has used descriptions and image-generating software to create the so-called first picture of the protagonist of EL James's novel Fifty Shades of Grey . Ahead of the big reveal, scientists have come up with their very own version of Christian Grey - created using the same e-fit software used to catch criminals. They have today revealed what they are dubbing the 'first picture' of the Fifty Shades protagonist, who previously only existed inside the imagination of the reader. Using the e-fit software employed in police investigations they strived to put a face to the mysterious character at the centre of millions of women's fantasies. They created the black-and-white image - which shows a man with tousled hair and high cheekbones - based on descriptions of how women imagined him to look. The handsome composite was the brainchild of University of Central Lancashire's (UCLan) Dr Faye Skelton, who said the man in the image had drawn comparisons with famous actors and sports stars. She took the descriptions from 12 female readers' to create the striking image. The inspiration: The e-fit was created using the eyes of Patrick Dempsey, left, and the jawline of Brad Pitt, right . The e-fit academics were inspired by David Beckham's face shape and jawline when they created the image , and right, a young Val Kilmer's lips were put forward as women's fantasy feature . Greys Anatomy star Patrick Dempsey's . eyes were cited as those women thought Christian Grey might have, while . Brad Pitt's famous chiselled jawline was used to help create the fantasy . Christian Grey's face. Dr Skelton said: ""While we don't want . to intrude on anyone's fantasies, based on a small sample of women, . this is the image of Christian Grey they have in their heads when . reading the novels. 'Personally, I think he's quite handsome, although everyone's interpretation will be different. 'It was just a bit of fun, but it does show the quality of image we can now generate. 'Most . of the descriptions drew comparisons with famous film stars, which may . help Hollywood moguls when the film remake comes to casting.' One . fan, Laura Stokes, 24, from Perry Barr, Birmingham, said: 'I think it's . better if it's left to women's imaginations rather than a computer - . but it still pretty clever. Fifty Shades of fantasy: The e-fit, made from combining a list of 12 famous faces, has echoes of TOWIE star Mark Wright, left, and right, rugby star Jonny Wilkinson . Real life Christian Greys? the computer generated image of Christian Grey has drawn comparisons with model David Gandy, left, and right, Welsh rugby star Gavin Henson . 'It's not the image I have of him in my head, but he's very good looking nonetheless.' The e-fit, the result of a combination of 12 famous faces, looked strangely familar, drawing comparisons with former England rugby captain Jonny Wilkinson, and fellow rugby playing peer and ex-partner of Charlotte Church, Gavin Henson. Others thought the e-fit bore more than a passing resemblance to Eddie Redmayne, thanks to the full lips, and Mark Wright of TOWIE for his chiselled jaw and classic good looks. Model David Gandy earned a mention, as did fellow model Paul Sculfor. Author EL James' first book in the trilogy has sold ten million copies world-wide becoming the fastest-selling novel of all time - outselling Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code and even JK Rowling's Harry Potter books.

"A woman who feared she may have Ebola has tested negative for the deadly virus at a hospital in south London, health officials have confirmed. The patient, who has a history of travel to West Africa, went to St George's Hospital in Tooting last night complaining of a fever. A Public Health England (PHE) spokesman said today that test results for the disease had come back negative. The patient was kept in isolation and was closely monitored overnight in line with national guidelines for handling the outbreak. She will continue to stay in hospital. Scroll down for video . Treatment: The patient presented herself to St George's Hospital (pictured) in Tooting, south London, last night with a high temperature. After telling staff she had visited west Africa, she was tested for Ebola . A spokesman for St George's Healthcare NHS Trust said: 'An unwell patient who had recently travelled to West Africa was admitted to St George's Hospital yesterday. 'In line with national guidance the patient was moved to our clinical infections unit and underwent a series of tests, as a precaution one of which was for Ebola. 'The outcome of the Ebola test result is negative. We can confirm that the patient will remain at St George's Hospital. 'All appropriate actions have been taken by our staff to protect the public and the patient.' A PHE spokesman said: 'It is important to remember that as yet, there has not been a case of Ebola diagnosed in the UK and the infection can only be transmitted through contact with the bodily fluids - such as blood, vomit or faeces - of an infected person. 'We have advised all front line medical practitioners and NHS call handlers to be alert to signs and symptoms of Ebola in those returning from affected areas and following such advice we would expect to see an increase in testing.' He said PHE would not confirm how many people have been tested for the virus in the UK since the outbreak in West Africa. A person infected with Ebola virus will typically develop a fever, a headache, joint and muscle pain, a sore throat, and intense muscle weakness. These symptoms start suddenly between two and 21 days after becoming infected. Diarrhoea, vomiting, a rash, stomach pain and impaired kidney and liver function follow. The patient then bleeds internally, and may also bleed from the ears, eyes, nose or mouth. Ebola virus disease is fatal in 50 to 90 per cent of cases. The sooner a person is given care, the better the chances that they will survive. Source: NHS Choices . Earlier today, visitors to the hospital told how sections of the building were cordoned off while the tests took place. A visitor, who popped out of the hospital to phone a relative after her father was taken to A&E, said that, when she returned, the corridor was blocked and staff were not letting people through. The woman, who did not wish to be named, said: 'When I went back in, the A&E section was closed off with a big sign saying ""do not enter"" with staff standing nearby to make sure no-one got through. 'I heard someone saying something about a woman having Ebola. 'I was worried as I had to get back to my dad and the corridor was now blocked. A&E is split into major and minor and it was the major that was cordoned off.' Map of the location: The patient was treated in isolation at St George's Hospital in Tooting, south London . A spokesman for the hospital later said the patient had tested negative for Ebola but would remain in its care . A Public Health England spokesman said this morning: 'PHE can confirm it will undertake precautionary tests relating to a patient presently at St George's Hospital in Tooting, who has a history of travel to West Africa. 'Ebola is considered unlikely but testing is being done as a precaution, as is our usual practice in these circumstances. We are confident that all appropriate actions are being taken to protect the public's health.' It comes after the head of a leading charity said yesterday that the Ebola crisis in west Africa is still getting worse. An atmosphere of 'fear and anxiety' pervades the region, Save the Children chief executive Justin Forsyth said on a trip to Freetown in Sierra Leone. So far, almost 5,000 people have been killed by the virus and more than 13,000 have been infected, although experts say the real figures could be much higher. William Pooley, 19, of Suffolk - who had been working as a nurse in Sierra Leone - was the first confirmed Briton to contract Ebola and was flown home in August to be treated in a specially-adapted unit at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, north-west London. Previous case: William Pooley, 19, who had been working as a nurse in Sierra Leone - was the first confirmed Briton to contract Ebola and was flown home to be treated in a specially-adapted unit in north-west London . He was treated with the experimental drug ZMapp. After being given the all-clear he agreed to donate his blood plasma, which contains antibodies vital to combating the disease, in a bid to develop treatment for victims. But he returned to Sierra Leone again last month. Last month, a suspected Ebola patient walked into A&E at Lewisham Hospital in south-east London, fearing he had the virus after travelling to Britain from Sierra Leone two weeks earlier. The man - who was later found not to have the virus - was not transferred to the specialist Royal Free Hospital, which is the only hospital in Britain equipped with a fully 'Ebola-proof' isolation unit. Also last month, a training exercise saw an actor pretend to collapse at a shopping centre in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, after telling passers-by he was not feeling well. He was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle by an ambulance crew equipped to deal with an Ebola case, where he was put into an isolation unit - and then transferred 300 miles south to the Royal Free Hospital. Test run: Staff from North East Ambulance Service and the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle carry out a Ebola training exercise last month . Health crisis: So far, almost 5,000 people have been killed by the virus. Pictured, an ambulance leaves an isolation unit carrying the bodies of victims to a burial site, at the Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone . London Mayor Boris Johnson has previously admitted that he expected Ebola to come to Britain soon and warned that he feared the disease would probably hit the capital first. 'I have little doubt that eventually there will be a case of Ebola in this country and probably in this city,' he said, adding that it was impossible to blood test everybody coming into the country. And Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told Parliament in October that up to ten Ebola cases could be seen in Britain by Christmas - and that the health crisis will get worse before it improves. Other UK hospitals and health centres which have seen walk-in cases of patients tested for Ebola - with negative results - include the City of Coventry Health Centre and Southmead Hospital in Bristol. St George's Hospital - which is currently featuring in Channel 4 series 24 Hours in A&E - has nearly 8,000 staff across the Trust and serves a local population in the capital of 1.3million.","She went to hospital in Tooting, south London, with a high temperature .

"An Arizona high school has sparked outrage from civil rights leaders after it held a 'Redneck Day' for students. Yesterday's school-wide event at Queen Creek High School was designed to satirize a reality TV show called 'Duck Dynasty,' school officials said. But the day's questionable title has offended some students, parents and local African-American and civil rights leaders who claim it serves as grim reminders of slavery and segregation. Anger: Queen Creek High School, pictured, has sparked outrage from civil rights leaders after it held a 'Redneck Day' for students . According to the Arizona Republic, one student wore a large Confederate flag to school, which particularly upset critics. 'We all know the connotation of ""redneck,"" Rev. Ozetta Kirby, pastor of Holy Trinity Community AME Church in nearby Mesa told the newspaper. He added that the day 'really got to' his 16-year-old grandson, Marcus, who attends the school. Steve Montoya, a prominent civil-rights attorney in Phoenix, said the Confederate flag was the most offensive part. He told the Arizona Republic: 'The Confederacy represents the horrible institution of slavery, and that is a direct attack on African-Americans.' Spoof: The school-wide event was designed to satirize a reality TV show called 'Duck Dynasty,' pictured, which follows a family of duck hunters in Louisiana . Tom Lindsey, the superintendent of the Queen Creek Unified School District, said the only intent of 'Redneck Day' was to spoof the characters on the reality show, which follows a family of duck hunters in Louisiana. He said the student wearing the Confederate flag wasn't from Arizona and didn't appreciate the reaction the flag would receive. The boy was pulled aside and asked to change his clothes by an assistant principal and the meaning of the flag in Arizona was explained to him. 'We apologize to any people who, because of the word (redneck), were offended,' Lindsey said.","Wednesday's event at Queen Creek High School was designed to satirize a reality TV show called 'Duck Dynasty'

ISIS jihadists posed with assault rifles underneath the bridge in Mosul - their largest stronghold in Iraq . Dozens of fighters from the terror group took part in the training drill in the Iraqi city on Sunday . Today's military drill follows days of massacres by ISIS across Iraq and Syria, which have become commonplace in areas held by the terror group as it imposes a severe form of sharia law. The extremists lined up and shot dead at least 50 tribesmen, women and children in Iraq's Anbar province, officials said today. The latest mass killing by the militant group against a Sunni tribe took place in the village of Ras al-Maa, north of Ramadi. There, the militant group killed at least 40 men, six women and four children, lining them up and publicly killing them one by one, Sheikh Naim al-Gaoud, a senior figure in the targeted Al Bu Nimr tribe, said. The training exercise follows weeks of mass killings across ISIS controlled areas of Iraq and Syria .

Pictured are the bodies of 30 men from the Anbar province, west of Baghdad, who were executed on Thursday . Another 17 people were kidnapped by ISIS, he added. This took the number of people in the tribe killed by the terror group close to 300. Yesterday, in Syria, grim pictures emerged showing ISIS supporters encouraging a baby to kick the severed head of a dead soldier. The father can be seen smiling with delight in the photo as he watches his innocent child kick the severed head. It appears to be the head of a dead prisoner, although it is hard to distinguish his features due to the heavy decomposition of the face. The face has also suffered a deep wound, suggesting the victim had been mulitated with a knife. A shocking photo has emerged showing a suspected ISIS supporter encouraging a toddler to kick the severed head of a dead soldier . Earlier today Unesco chief Irina Bokova slammed the 'barbaric' destruction of Iraq's cultural heritage, as ISIS jihadists destroy age-old sites in areas they control. Iraq has 'thousands of temples, of buildings, of archaeological sites, of objects, that represent a treasure for (all) humanity,' Bokova said during a visit to Baghdad, Iraq. 'We cannot agree that this treasure, that this legacy of human civilisation, is being destroyed in the most barbaric matter,' she said. 'We have to act, we don't have time to lose, because extremists are trying to erase the identity, because they know that if there is no identity, there is no memory, there is no history, and we think this is appalling and this is not acceptable.'","ISIS militants seen abseiling off a motorway bridge as part of training drill .

"A retired decorator has painted his whole council house in the style of the Sistine Chapel and is using celebrities as models for his versions of priceless Renaissance paintings. Robert Burns, who lives in a £93-per-week rented home in Brighton, East Sussex, has depicted Russell Brand as Jesus, Wayne Rooney in prayer and Jose Mourinho as Leonardo da Vinci's Salvator Mundi. The only hint of what is within the 1960s terrace is the Renaissance decorations he has added to his green . wheelie bin, and his house number is in Roman numerals. The 66-year-old's ten-year project is all the more impressive because he has never been to Italy and has never been taught art. When Rome meets Brighton: Retired painter and decorator Robert Burns has painted his council house to look like the Sistine Chapel . Renaissance man: Mr Burns has used celebrities as his muses, including comedian Russell Brand as Jesus, and even his wheelie bin is decorated spectacularly . No clue: Despite the fantastical painting and decorating inside the building, the outside of this humble terrace shows no signs of Mr Burns' flair for art . Grandfather-of-three Mr Burns, 66, said: 'I get inspired when I see a celebrity offering themselves in a Renaissance pose. 'I used the Russell Brand picture from the front of a magazine, I thought he looked like Jesus of Nazareth. 'I just put the crown of thorns on his head. 'It is the camera angle that inspires me.' He added: 'I don't follow football but when I found out Jose Mourinho calls himself 'The Special One' I knew I had to do him next. 'He is extremely photogenic, there was this photograph and I thought, 'he looks just like the Salvator Mundi photo'. 'Salvator Mundi means Saviour of the World, I think it suits him very well.' Incredible: The ceilings of his council house have renaissance scenes simlar to those found in Rome, but this one is in his upstairs loo . Magnificent: The grandfather-of-three and former decorator has painted his entire home in this style, although the spare room still needs some work . Inspired by the stars: His religious art includes Wayne Rooney in the style of Francis of Assisi by Francisco de Zurbaran and 'the special one' Jose Mourinho . He has also painted Wayne Rooney in the style of Francis of Assisi by Francisco de Zurbaran after seeing him in prayer. Mr Burns describes the picture as 'the ultimate hoody'. Mr Burns has famously painted the entirety of the inside of his terrace home with elaborate frescoes inspired by 15th century Italian painters. Every surface in his house - bar the spare room - shows a gilt-edged nativity scene, cherub or picture of the Virgin Mary. In the last year Mr Burns has also dedicated his bathroom to the Renaissance style - in fact there is just one room in his three-bedroom house not yet decorated. His bathroom has pictures inspired by The Triumph of Galatea by Raphael and The Birth of Venus by Botticelli the ceiling is painted with a version of the Venus and Adonis by Sebastiano Ricci. Talented: Mr Burns started work on the house in 2003 and ten years on he admits that if he were to leave the house he would want to take his artworks with him, but knows he can't . Magic: His bathroom has pictures inspired by The Triumph of Galatea by Raphael and The Birth of Venus by Botticelli the ceiling is painted with a version of the Venus and Adonis by Sebastiano Ricci . Eye for art: Despite his passion for the renaissance Mr Burns has never visited Italy to see the art in situ and has never been formally taught art . He first started decorating his home in 2003 and in the last decade has dedicated hours to transforming boring magnolia walls into works of art. Mr Burns said: 'The spare room is still waiting to be painted. 'That will be the next project. 'I have recently completed an altar piece in the bedroom. 'I'm really pleased with how it has all turned out.' As the work is painted onto plaster if Mr Burns ever moves he will be unable to take his work of art with him. Despite his passion for the Renaissance Mr Burns has never visited Italy to see the art in situ and has never been formally taught art. Instead he is inspired by books on art and especially on the Vatican he picks up at car boot sales. He says his children and grandchildren are used to visiting the house now and 'hardly notice it anymore'.","Robert Burns, 66, has spent ten years turning his £93-per-week council home into a giant work of art .

"Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, a cross-dressing artist had a magical idea to build a fairytale house. It would look just like somewhere Hansel and Gretel would like to live (provided they wanted to live in Essex) and of course, it would have an enchanting tale behind it. Three years ago it was simply a dream for Turner prizewinner Grayson Perry. Today his vision – nicknamed the Gingerbread House by disgruntled locals in the rural, riverside village where he’s plonked it – is a reality nearing completion. Scroll down for video . Unusual design: Grayson will also be responsible for designing the interior of the two-bedroomed home . The cottage tells the story of a mythical woman named Julie, whose statute sits atop the house (pictured right) Britain's most bizarre holiday cottage? A green and gold gingerbread home is nearing completion in Essex . He is proudly putting the finishing touches to the two-bedroom holiday cottage at Wrabness, on the banks of the Stour estuary – and it will soon be available as a holiday rent. Some of the locals have declared it ‘a practical joke’ and say it will ruin the landscape. But here’s a twist in the tale. Despite some continuing misgivings and the initial horror of some residents when the plans were announced, there is a growing feeling that everyone might yet live happily ever after alongside the artist’s green and gold creation. One told the Daily Mail: ‘I love it!’ Janet Higgins, 65, added: ‘I find it really uplifting. It’s a beautiful spot, and it needed something like this.’ The house is located on the banks of the River Stour, near the rural village of Wrabness . The home's green and white ceramic tiles, which feature safety pins, can be seen for miles . Perry admits that he first came up with the design whilst 'doodling wildly and quite drunkenly in front of the TV' Perry admitted he had originally designed the house whilst ‘doodling wildly and quite drunkenly in front of the television’. He wanted it to resemble a ‘jewel box’ that told the story of a mythical Essex woman called Julie, who had a difficult childhood, love life, divorce and late career. Hence, there’s an 8ft statue of her on the roof, naked and pregnant, and her name is emblazoned all over the walls. The nappy pins and hearts may be a tribute to her mothering skills; the three knives on shields are the Essex coat of arms; and the cassette tapes are assumed to be elements of her story. Outside, 2,000 hand-made tiles provide the colour. Inside, tapestries and mosaics have been designed to illustrate Julie’s life. Before: A pebble-stone farmhouse initially stood on the land. However, some residents are still unhappy that the more traditional structure was torn down . Local residents in favour of Grayson Perry's creation hope that it will bring tourists to the area . The Turner Prize-winning, cross-dressing artist is known primarily for his work with ceramics . The project was funded by Living Architecture, which engages world class architects to create unique homes for rent. Perry told locals at a village hall presentation the house would effectively be a shrine to Julie, a conceptual, everyday woman from the county in which he was born. Later he revealed he had taken inspiration ‘from single mums in Dagenham and hairdressers in Colchester’. The house, he said, would ‘relate to buildings put up as memories to loved ones, to follies, to eccentric home-built structures, to shrines, lighthouses and fairy tales’. Quite so. Except that some objectors told planners the proposed building was a ‘monstrosity’. Although the parish council denied the plans for the re-build, a second application was eventually approved . Perry has said that he hopes and believes that the cottage 'will add greatly to the cultural standing of the area' Despite this, Tendring District Council granted permission for the 54-year-old married father-of-one to create his dream. Elizabeth McCloy, who lives on the lane to the house, described it as ‘very interesting but in the wrong place’. She added: ‘It has totally ruined the natural scenery.’ Kate Kincaid, however, disagreed. ‘We are quite privileged to live next door to it. I suspect the number of visitors will be annoying though.’ Picking up on that theme, another resident said: ‘People will come and visit from London and have a very amusing tale to tell at dinner parties. 'But they won’t have to look at it day in and day out and wonder if they are victims of a practical joke.’","Artist Grayson Perry nearing completion on avant-garde holiday cottage .

"Brad Pitt's zombie action flick has been mired by negative publicity concerning rewrites, re-shoots and an inexperienced creative team that has caused the film's budget to increase from $170million to a reported $400million. Based upon Max Brooks's science fiction novel of the same name, the film now has the biggest budget ever recorded. And with the film opening in cinemas next month, could World War Z be the most expensive flop in cinematic history? Scroll down for trailer . Re-shoots: Brad Pitt's production company had to pay $200 million to re-film the final act because no one liked the ending . Bad times: Brad Pitt's World War Z has reached a $400 million budget, making it the most expensive film in cinematic history . Commentators have cited a number of the reasons for the poor predictions of the film's box office success. Help: Lost and Star Trek writer Damon Lindelof was brought in to help steer World War Z in the right direction . Vanity Fair contributor . Laura M. Holson blamed poor communication between director . Marc Forster and 42-year-old star Pitt whose production company Plan B is bankrolling the project. She said their differences led to an unclear ending to the story that caused serious delays in filming. Forster's limited experience of big budget films - previous credits include Quantum Of Solace which earned box office success but was considered a critical failure - was also pointed out as a possible reason for the overrunning of the . shoot. A day of filming was reportedly lost after caterers didn't have . enough food to feed 750 extras and 'undocumented bills from a Malta shoot' were found unpaid, also adding to the escalating budget costs. Scenes for the movie were shot on . location in three continents in the cities of Glasgow, Budapest, Malta, New York, and Russia Budapest which will . have increased the budget further. The screen rights were secured in 2007, and Changeling writer JM Straczynski's drafted an initial script, reportedly praised by many in the way it redefined the genre. But in the six years since then, the film went through a complete rewrite by Matthew Michael Carnahan (The Kingdom) to make it fit into the action genre more readily. Vanity Fair say Pitt's production company Plan B then spent . an extra $200 million to re-shoot the film's 40-minute long third act, because 'executives weren't happy with the ending.' That's when Lost and Star Trek writer Damon Lindelof was brought into help. Pitt reportedly told Lindelof: 'The thing we really need right now is someone who is not burdened . by all the history that this thing is inheriting, who can see what . we've got and tell us how to get to where we need to get.' Inexperience: A creative team unused to working on blockbuster films also contributed to the problems on set and rising budget . Speaking to Vanity Fair Lindelof admitted: 'I didn't think anyone was going to say, 'Let's throw it out and try . something else.""' That is precisely what happened, with . the producers both at Plan B and Paramount - who bought the option with . Pitt for $1 million - agreeing to dump previously shot footage and make . way for a complete rewrite of the final act. Commentators claim the $400million film will struggle at the box office because it is not part of a movie franchise. Drumming up interest: Brad Pitt speaks to the audience at a special viewing for his film World War Z held at the Museum of Modern Art on Wednesday night in New York City . While Iron Man 3 and Star Trek Into . Darkness benefited from their global fanbase returning to the cinema, World . War Z is the first adaption of Max Brooks's zombie novel. The original book is presented as a . series of anecdotal histories detailed by various survivors of the . zombie apocalypse from across the world. The highest grossing zombie movie of all . time is Hotel Transylvania securing approximately $148 millon followed . by Zombieland with $76 million according to Boxofficemojo.com. Is it any good? Brad also surprised an audience at a special screening of the flick in New Jersey to check reactions from fans, who filmed him doing so . Film Analyst Phil Contrino of BoxOffice.com, told Business Insider: I think $120 million to $150 million here is a very possible [box office] goal for World War Z. 'It's . a kind of movie that people really respond to. I think people are . missing the comparison to I Am Legend, another zombie movie that was . extremely successful.' However, if Contrino's estimate about World War Z's box office success proves accurate that would mean a loss of almost $250 million. World War Z is released in the UK & US on June 21st.","The budget for the zombie movie ballooned from original $170 million .

"An animal act billed as the world’s smallest pony has been kidnapped from a horse fair in Italy. Charlie, who is just 63cm tall, was snatched from his stall overnight in the Umbrian town of Città di Castello. Police believe the mafia may be holding Charlie for ransom. Pony-napped: Charlie, believed to be one of the world's smallest horses was stolen from his stable ahead of a horse fair in Italy (file photo) He was due to perform at the show with his owner but ‘equestrian artist’ Bartolo Messina was forced to alert police when he found the pony’s stall empty. Police are investigating the theory that the mafia may be involved and believe the thieves could be holding the pony for ransom. The tiny show-pony was in the central Italian town for the 47th edition of the National Horse Fair. Police said that the horse thieves snipped a wire fence surrounding the fairgrounds, grabbed the miniature pony and made off through a nearby tobacco field where a car was waiting to speed them away. Investigation: Police in the Umbrian town of Città di Castello believe the local Mafia may be involved and that Charlie is being held for money . A spokesman for the Carabinieri in Citta di Castello said: ‘Investigations are continuing. We are not excluding any possibilities including that the perpetrators are part of a criminal organisation.’ The President of the National Horse Show Angelo Capecci called the theft ‘a shameful act’. He said: ‘We were victims of a serious crime that offends and humiliates the equine world.’ ‘The security measures that for years have ensured the safety of the participants and that have always prevented the occurrence of similar incidents, were apparently undermined by a shameful act that does not reflect the horse world and its values. ‘ . He added: ‘We sympathise with Bartolo Messina, a great equestrian artist who loves and lives by his horses, and had trained the victim of this sad episode with extraordinary kindness and ability .’","Miniature pony 'believed to have been taken by Mafia'

"Business owners and motorists today hit out at developers of a new skyscraper which they blame for starting fires and causing damage by reflecting the sun's rays. The half-finished 37-storey tower in central London has been dubbed the ‘Walkie Scorchie’ due to its distinctive shape and apparent ability to bounce heat from the sun onto buildings in the next street. Angry business owners in Eastcheap say the £200 million project has blistered paintwork, caused tiles to smash and singe fabric. A motorist has also said the intense heat melted part of his Jaguar. One shopkeeper said the glare caused his doormat to start smoking and damaged a lemon, another said it blistered paint - and one journalist even managed to fry an egg with the startlingly bright rays. Scroll down for video . Unbelievable: An egg is fried in intense sunlight reflected from the Walkie-Talkie building, in Eastcheap in the City of London, where sun light reflected from the building melted part of a Jaguar car . Further damage: The seat of a bicycle parked near the building was also allegedly singed by the blinding light . How does it happen? This graphic shows how the concave shape of the skyscraper means a large amount of sunlight is reflected into a small area . Scorched: Men stand in the doorway of a barbers shop, which has a burn mark on the carpet in London. It was reported that the carpet was set alight from sunlight reflected by the Walkie Talkie tower . Even the fruit suffered: A damaged lemon is seen in the window of a barbers shop in the City of London . Looking up: A general view of the Walkie Talkie building, taken from Eastcheap in the City of London . Developers called the problem with . the building at 20 Fenchurch Street ‘a phenomenon’ and said they . are ‘looking into the matter as a priority’. Cyclists have also reported scorched bicycle seats. Ali . Akay, of Re Style barber's, said the position of the sun at a certain . time of the day caused a searing bolt of sunlight to start a small fire . and burn a hole in his company doormat. He . said: ‘We were working and just saw the smoke coming out of the carpet. We tried to cut the fire down, there were customers in at the time and . they were obviously not happy. ‘Customers are not going to come in if there is a fire in the front of the door.’ Blinding: The phenomenon takes place in the afternoon on bright days in the City of London . Up close: A camera man films broken slates outside a cafe in London. It was reported the tiles had shattered from sunlight reflected by the Walkie Talkie tower . Problems: Tiles melted and a doormat caught fire after being hit by the rays reflected from the Walkie Talkie . Big issue: The singed carpet in the barber's shop in the City of London can be seen here, circled . Due to it's concave design, sunlight is reflected into a very localised point in the early afternoon . Mr Akay, 22, said they had spoken to the managers of 20 Fenchurch Street to find a solution. 'Customers are not going to come in if there is a fire in the front of the door' Ali Akay, Re Style barber's . He . said: ‘It is getting really serious. This is a health and safety issue. They should have looked into this before they built it.’ Colleague Ayca Juma, 29, said: ‘It's the Walkie Scorchie. That's what caused this.’ Next door at the Viet Cafe, Diana Pham, 25, said they had suffered similar problems. Cycling past: Sun rays and heat reflected from the Walkie Talkie building caused extreme heat on Eastcheap . Bright light: 'Boris Bikes' are lined up on the left of this photograph, taken near the Walkie Talkie building . ‘Yesterday . it was very hot so there was a concentration of light here,' she said. 'We thought . something was burning in the restaurant but it wasn't, we searched . everywhere.

But I don't know what they (the developers) can do about it.’ Motorists . have reported problems, too. Local businessman Martin Lindsay told City . A.M. his high-spec Jaguar XJ, parked on Eastcheap on Thursday . afternoon, had warped panels along one side. Mystery: The building developers are investigating the bizarre phenomenon . 'Burning plastic smell': The car was said to have been in the ray for just an hour but the panels were buckled . The wing mirror and badge had also melted from the heat of the reflection, he claimed.

"Facing court threat: Princess Cristina could be named as a suspect in a multimillion euro fraud case . The daughter of Spain's King Juan Carlos may be formally named as a suspect in a  multimillion fraud case, it was reported today. Princess Cristina faces a possible indictment as her husband Inaki Urdangarin - the Duke of Palma - appeared in court  to be questioned about allegations of money-laundering. Politicians are already calling for the abdication of her father after 37 years on the throne as anger grows over the corruption scandal engulfing the family. The preliminary request by prosecutors to name the princess is likely to be made next week based on the evidence of Diego Torres, her husband's business partner. Today on the Mediterranean island of in Palma de Mallorca, Urdangarin faced questions over allegations he and Torres funneled millions of euros to companies they controlled via a foundation on which Cristina served as a board member. Around 170 police kept noisy protesters away from the courthouse as Urdangarin, who has not been charged with a crime, went into the building. The investigating magistrate has ordered that he and Torres post a joint bond of €8.1m (£7m). They are alleged to have done fraudulent deals with politicians in regional . governments in Valencia and the Balearic Islands while running the not-for-profit Nóos Institute. Part of the money was then laundered through offshore accounts, it was claimed. Both Urdangarin and Torres deny any wrongdoing. Scroll down for video . Questions: Urdangarin  and Princess Cristina who served on the board of his foundation . Family: Princess Cristina holds her daughter Irene beside  her husband Inaki Urdangarin in 2005 . Miguel Bernad, head of the far-right Clean Hands movement told the Guardian: 'If the princess sits in the dock, the blow to the monarchy's prestige will be huge.' King Juan Carlos: Reported to be outraged by his son-in-law's behaviour . Clean Hands sent a prosecutor to join the case and has made earlier requests to magistrate José Castro to name Cristina as a suspect. Now Bernad has claimed new evidence had cast serious doubts over her husband's statement that his wife had a 'hands-off ' relationship with the foundation. Castro was set to question Urdangarin about three alleged offences . against the Treasury, including corporate tax fraud related to his . foundation and matters linked to his personal income tax returns. The judge also intends to ask about alleged bank accounts in tax havens such as Andorra, Luxembourg and Switzerland. Last week Torres revealed he had copies of dozens of emails that allegedly show that King Carlos tried to help his son-in-law land big contracts. The Guardian reported that he has hundreds of emails stored, and has slowly been releasing them in as an attempt to force the royal family to help him avoid jail . The investigation into the alleged financial misdeeds has deeply embarrassed the monarchy in a country hard hit by a financial crisis and sky-high unemployment. Urdangarin was given the title of Duke of Palma by the king, now 75, after his daughter married the Olympic-medal winning handball player in 1997.","Duke of Palma alleged to have done fraudulent deals with politicians .

"A country barman has experienced life as a millionaire after he discovered a 'loophole' in his bank's ATM system. Dan Saunders, from Wangaratta in north-eastern Victoria, lived the high life for about four and a half months in February 2011, spending wildly on expensive escorts, private jets, exclusive restaurants and gambling. The 29-year old-stumbled across a technical fault in the National Australia Bank's  ATM system which meant he had access to free money whenever or wherever he wanted. Scroll down for video . Dan Saunders (pictured) living it up. He went on a wild spending spree paying for private jets, hookers and  gambling . The country barman  discovered a 'loophole' in his bank's ATM system one night when he went to get some money out while drinking with friends . One night he needed to withdraw cash from the ATM but he just had $3 in his savings account, so what he did was transfer $200 from his credit card, and despite the screen saying 'transaction cancelled' it worked . He took home his first $200 before embarking on a transaction spree . 'I've never felt more alive than when I was charging on my credit card,' Mr Saunders told Australia's Current Affair. - He would transfer money from credit to his savings account while ATM system was 'offline' -The ATM would read 'transaction cancelled' - but still dished out the money . - He took advantage of a loophole in the system which meant the ATM couldn't record transactions during late-night maintenance - but still dispensed cash . - The withdrawal would not  register on his account - effectively giving him free cash . - He continued withdrawing and the bank didn't catch up . - He also tricked the ATM by transferring money from his 'credit' option to his Mastercard... even though he only had one credit card . 'With the NAB card I could be anyone I wanted to be, go anywhere I wanted to go, do anything as long as I had the card in my back pocket. I felt like a king.' 'I felt like a rock star, probably looked like a fat, white Kanye West, but you felt like you were Kanye West,' he said. In an exclusive interview with ACA, he divulged how it all unfolded one night out for beers with mates and how he quickly went on a wild spending spree, with money that was not his. Mr Saunders had just moved to Wangaratta in country Victoria and one evening in February, 2011 he was out drinking with friends. Like most people he needed to withdraw cash from the ATM, but when he tried, he realised he just had $3 in his savings account, so what he did was transfer $200 from his credit card. 'It said transaction cancelled but it worked,' he said. $200 richer, Mr Saunders happily went back to the pub to continue drinking with his friends. Dan Saunders (pictured) went on a wild spending spree on his discovery and told his new friends he was a poker player, sometimes a surgeon or an investment banker . From the humble life as a barman in Wangaratta, in country Victoria, Dan Saunders (pictured right) reached millionaire status and lived life to max from a technical fault in his banks ATM system . The barman who made a mere $700 a week couldn't believed his luck when he stumbled apon the technical fault in the banking system . But it wasn't until later that night that the barman, who earned a mere $700 a week, decided to try his luck again. He tried to check his account balance at another ATM but it was just registering 'balance unavailable' so he again transferred $200 and it worked before he pushed his withdrawals out to $2000, the limit of his credit card and went home. Because ATM are known to go offline at certain times, where people can transfer funds but not get a balance for their account, the money he was withdrawing was not registering. He didn't stop  there and within a couple of weeks, Saunders had  transferred $20,000. With his new found riches, rumours started to make their way around the small town and when he began punting heavily with a mate while at work one night at the pub, his luck turned. 'Turns out that we turned over more than the TAB would turn over in three weeks in one night so that alerted the TAB to the fact that we'd done that,' he told ACA. 'I told them it was friend taking the bets but they didn't want to take that on board and they got the publican to fire me as a result.' To make matters worse, rumours made their way to his girlfriend, that he was spending money all over town and she then dumped him via text message. Private Jets.... why not?! Dan Saunders (pictured) splurged on a number of expensive items when money started rolling in from the ATM . Within a couple of months of withdrawing money from the ATM, because of a 'loophole' he had already stolen from NAB about $1.6 million on his credit card . Mr Saunders (pictured) who talked exclusively to ACA said he 'felt like a king' after conning money out of NAB's banking system . But instead of wallowing in his losses, he decided to go back to Melbourne, get some advice from friends and kept his bank balance, rather healthy. 'On one hand you've lost your girlfriend, lost your job, but on the other hand, hey, you've got unlimited funds. Let's smash it up for a bit let's sort things out,' he said. While he believed it was a luxury that would be short lived, Mr Saunders kept withdrawing more and more money every day and there his lifestyle as a country barman dramatically transformed into that of a millionaire. He created many different alias' to new friends, including being a poker player, a surgeon and even an investment banker, living the dream of a high roller. He then discovered another way to trick the ATM and double his money, transferring money from the ATM's 'credit' account option to his Mastercard, even though he only had one credit card. Dan Saunders (pictured) conned NAB bank out of thousands, then evevtually reaching $1.6 million through an ATM flaw . At first he thought it was a mistake but tried his luck again and realised he could beat the system and withdraw as much money as possible whenever and wherever he wanted . In May that year, Saunders was believed to have already stolen $1.6 million of the banks money on his credit card. But like anyone who is cheating the system, Saunders soon started felling guilty about his adventures and began to see a psychologist. It was in June, four and a half months after making his costly discovery, that he stopped making continuous transfers. He told ACA he then called the bank, who told him it was under police investigation and they wouldn't talk to him. 'It was never about the actual money it was just about the journey.' Three and a half years later and Mr Saunders had still got off scot free for his dealing with ATM's, still blazay about funding his lavish lifestyle with money that wasn't his own. 'I've overdrawn my own accounts if that makes me a crook that makes me a crook,' he said. It wasn't until just last week that police issued a warrant for his arrest and continue to look for Mr Saunders, who is now suddenly missing in action. After four and a half months of solid spending Dan Saunders (pictured) said guilt got the better of him and he rang the bank, but they said police were investigating and they wouldn't talk to him . Finally after three and a half years of not being caught for his wild spendings have police issued a warrant for his arrest .","Dan Saunders, 29, discovered a 'loophole' in his bank's ATM system .

"This is the incredible photo showing two U.S. sprinters crossing the finish line on the same thousandth of a second during trials for the Olympics - a finish too close for even the camera to call. Now a toss of a coin or a head-to-head sprint could decide whether Allyson Felix or Jeneba Tarmoh represents the country in the women's 100 meters at the London Olympics, athletics officials said. Felix and Tarmoh finished in a dead heat - at 11.068 seconds - for third place in Saturday's 100 final at the U.S. Olympic trials. They both leaned into the finish line and their torsos, by which a winner is judged, were even. Until now, there has been no protocol for determining the winner. Scroll down for video . Too close to call: Jeneba Tarmoh (bottom) and Allyson Felix both cross the finish line for the Olympic trials with a time of 11.068. The race is decided by when their torsos cross the line, and the picture showed a tie . Officials spent most of the next 24 hours developing a procedure for breaking the deadlock. Each nation can be represented by a maximum of three athletes per event at the Games. U.S. officials said the final place, who would join world champion Carmelita Jeter and Tianna Madison for the 100 in London, would be determined by the time the trials end on July 1. 'We will select our team before we leave here,' USA Track and Field (USATF) spokeswoman Jill Geer said. Battle: The track timer had initially named Tarmoh, right, as the winner before officials reviewed the results . Under the procedure, if neither athlete declines a position on the team, they can choose either a run-off or coin flip. Bob Kersee, who coaches both athletes, said he considered the procedure, which was developed by USATF and U.S. Olympic Committee officials, to be fair. 'But if there is a run-off, the health of the athlete must be protected,' Kersee said. If the two women fail to agree on which option to employ, the final place will be decided by a race. If they choose the toss of a coin, Felix, as . the highest ranking athlete, would pick heads or tails. The procedure, a two-page document, even specified details of the coin, which must be a quarter dollar with the image of first U.S. President George Washington on one side and an eagle on the reverse. Disbelief: The two women finished dead heat for the third position on the women's 100m Olympic team . Both Felix and Tarmoh will compete in the 200 trials on Thursday and the finals for that event are on Saturday. They have not been given an official deadline by which to make their decision for the 100 metre place. Kersey said they would not make their choice until after the 200 metre trials. Kersee said that track officials 'need to leave my athletes alone and let me coach them in the 200, then make a decision.' He added that he would not choose . which runner made the Olympic team because 'it would be like, ""Which kid . do you love the most?""' 'I’ve never seen anything like this,' Ato Boldon, a four-time Olympic sprinter from Trinidad and Tobago who . now works as an NBC boradcaster, said, the New York Times reported. Support: The two women have the same trainer and contracts with Nike. If they choose to run in a head-to-head, it will take place after this weekend, when they are both trying out for the 200m team . Anxious: Felix (right) is keen to compete in the Olympic 100m even though her main event is 200m . 'How long has this sport been around? It’s crazy that there’s not something very specific. I guarantee that there will be something put in there now. How we reached this point without a rule, I have no idea.' At first, the timer had ruled Tarmoh was the winner, with Felix, who has won three Olympic medals, placing one-thousandth of a second behind her. Brandishing a mini American flag, Tarmoh went to a news conference with Jeter and Madison, while Felix gave an emotional interview and said 'fourth is the worst'. But track officials revised the results and discovered there had been a tie. See below for video .

"Pharrell has lent his support to six young people in Iran who've been arrested by government authorities for creating their own version of video for the hitmaker's number one song Happy. The video titled Happy in Tehran features them dancing in various locales just as in the original and is one of hundreds of covers of the hit made by fans around the world. But after the video hit YouTube and racked up close to 200,000 views with the help of Western news sites like the Huffington Post, authorities hunted down its stars, interrogated them in footage seen across the country and threw them in jail. Sad: These six young residents of Tehran have been arrested for remaking Pharrell's feel good hit video Happy . Pharrell responded to the shocking arrest late Tuesday in a tweet expressing is dismay . 'After a vulgar clip which hurt public chastity was released in cyberspace, police decided to identify those involved in making that clip,' said Tehran police chief Hossein Sajedinia according to the ISNA news agency. By Tuesday night, the Grammy award winning singer had weighed in on the controversy. 'It's beyond sad these kids were arrested for trying to spread happiness,' Pharrell tweeted, with a link to a New York Times blog story about the arrests. The arrests came despite the three men and three women trying to dial back their fame by setting their video to private when they realized it had angered Islamic authorities. 'Following a series of intelligence and police operations and after coordinating with the judiciary, all the suspects were identified and arrested,' said Sajedinia. The Iranians' rendition of the hit angered authorities who seemed to fear it was evidence of a new generation casting aside the old Islamic lifestyle for Western ideals (a still from the remake is at left, with Pharrell's original at right) Islamic law requires women to cover their heads in public. Authorities called the video 'vulgar' Their interrogations showed the women veiled and angry officers asking questions. Sajedinia said they 'confessed to their criminal acts.' Islamic law stipulates that women must cover themselves in public. The video appears to show three women dancing exuberantly to the hit on Tehran rooftops, sans headress. The move comes a perplexing time since just recently Iranian President Hassan Rouhani spoke publicly in support of loosening the state's cencorship of the internet. 'We ought to see (the Internet) as an opportunity. We must recognise our citizens' right to connect to the World Wide Web,' said Rouhani according to the official IRNA news agency. The young people were publicly shamed as their interrogation was aired on Iranian television along with clips of their video . Veiled: The three women from the video were seen veiled in the interrogation footage . 'After a vulgar clip which hurt public chastity was released in cyberspace, police decided to identify those involved in making that clip,' said Tehran police chief Hossein Sajedinia . 'Why are we so shaky? Why have we cowered in a corner, grabbing onto a shield and a wooden sword, lest we take a bullet in this culture war?' he said in his weekend speech. In a interview with IranWire last month prior to the arrests, one of the women explained that the video was meant as a celebration of Iran and to show that young people there have fun like they do anywhere. 'Despite all the pressures and limitations,' she said, 'young people are joyful and want to make the situation better. They know how to have fun, like the rest of the world.'","The young men and women were participating in a worldwide viral phenomenon when they created their version of the song 'Happy'

"David Cameron is encouraging Barack Obama to leave his wife Michelle at home when he attends the G8 Summit in the UK this year. British sources say the Prime Minister wants the summit in June to be WAG-free to ensure leaders remain ‘focused’ on issues like tackling tax avoidance, without the distraction of having their wives and girlfriends in tow. Diplomats have begun the delicate process of enquiring whether the spouses of the world’s most powerful individuals are happy to be left behind during one of the highlights of the global political calendar. David Cameron has asked that the leaders of the G8 summit, including Barack and Michelle Obama, leave their wives and husbands at home . Samantha will break from tradition and not provide an alternative list of activities for wives and girlfriends of the G8 leaders . It is being made clear that Samantha Cameron plans to break with G8 tradition and not host a separate programme of activities for visiting wives. If the ploy is successful it means that the likes of Michelle Obama and Valerie Trierweiler, girlfriend of France’s Socialist President Francois Hollande, will not attend the summit, being held at the luxury Lough Erne resort in Northern Ireland. Officials admit that they will be powerless to resist if leaders insist on bringing their wives, in which case Mrs Cameron may host a modest lunch in Downing Street. But they hope to persuade them otherwise, in order to make the summit a business-like leaders-only affair. A Number 10 spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister wants the G8 to be small, intimate and focused on the three issues of the day - tax, trade and transparency. Other issues, like the role of spouses at the G8, are yet to be confirmed.’ Leaders such as French President Francois Hollande, pictured with Valerie Trierweiler, may decide to bring their partners anyway. Mr Cameron’s ploy is reminiscent of the stance taken by the former England football manager Fabio Capello who banned players’ wives and girlfriends - dubbed the WAGs - from attending the 2010 World Cup in South Africa so that they could focus on winning. The tactic failed when the team put in a string of dismal performances. British sources said Mr Cameron was inspired by last year’s G8 Summit at President Obama’s Camp David country retreat. The summit was attended by the leaders alone, although Mrs Obama hosted a White House lunch for visiting wives in Washington. The plan to scrap the traditional programme of events for the ‘First Wives Club’ is likely to raise eyebrows, particularly as Mrs Cameron has failed to attend any of the three G8 summits of her husband’s premiership. The role of the wives has become increasingly elaborate in recent years. In 2011 a pregnant Carla Bruni hosted a summit on tackling global illiteracy for visiting wives when the summit came to the French resort of Nice. Traditionally the partners of politicians are invited to state events, but Mrs Cameron has failed to attend any of her husbands G8 Summits . In 2009 Sarah Brown was granted an audience with the Pope and treated to a cultural tour of Rome when the summit was held in the Italian capital. And Cherie Blair laid on a shopping spree, tree planting and drinks with the Queen and Prince Philip when Britain last hosted the G8 in 2005. British sources insisted that Mrs Cameron was not snubbing the event and that the plan to ditch the programme for leaders’ wives had not come from her. The arrangement will be greeted with relief by Joachim Sauer, the low-profile husband of Angela Merkel, who shuns the limelight and rarely attends summits. It will also come as welcome news to security chiefs who are having to deal with an alarming resurgence in terrorist activity by dissident republicans. One source said: ‘We are already trying to work out what to do if Putin wants to swim in the lough. The fewer people we have to deal with, the easier it will be.’ But the pared-down G8 is likely to disappoint members of the public in Northern Ireland who will miss the chance to see Mrs Obama, Mrs Cameron and other first ladies.","Cameron has asked that the G8 leaders leave their partners at home .

"A sperm donor has been ordered to pay child support for the biological daughter he fathered to a lesbian couple who found him via Craigslist. Angela Bauer, 40, and partner Jennifer Schreiner, 34, placed an ad on the site three years ago for a donor which was answered by William Marotta. 'We are foster and adoptive parents and now we desire to share a pregnancy and birth together,' Bauer wrote in the online posting. Donor: William Marotta, pictured, answered an ad placed on Craigslist by Angela Bauer, and her partner Jennifer Schreiner looking for a sperm donor . Battle: Angela Bauer and former partner Jennifer Schreiner (right) are supporting their sperm donor William Marotta in his fight against paying child support for their daughter . Mr Marotta provided sperm which was used for artificial insemination by Ms Schreiner. In return, he gave up parental rights including financial duties for the child. Should sperm donors be exempt from all financial responsibility for the child? Should sperm donors be exempt from all financial responsibility for the child? Now share your opinion . The three signed a legal document which stated Mr Marotta, a married mechanic who fosters children with his wife, would have no rights to the child. Bauer and Schreiner updated Marotta on their daughter's well-being occasionally but he has had little contact, according to the Kansas City Star. The arrangement changed earlier this year when Ms Schreiner, the only parent registered on her daughter's birth certificate, applied for social welfare. Ms Bauer had been supporting the child but was left unable to work due to ill health. On October 3, 2012, attorney Mark McMillan filed a petition on behalf of the Department of Children and Families seeking a ruling that Marotta is the father of Schreiner's child and owes a duty to support her. United: Ms Bauer and Ms Schreiner celebrating their same-sex union. The couple adopted eight children together during their relationship but have not been given the same rights as straight couples . Caregiver: Mr Marotta is a married mechanic who fosters children with his wife . It said the department provided cash assistance totaling $189 for the girl for July through September 2012, and had paid medical expenses totaling nearly $6,000. Schreiner had allegedly been put under pressure to reveal Mr Marotta's name so that her daughter could continue to have health care. The legal agreement that the three made in 2009 was deemed invalid by Kansas state because they did not use a certified doctor for the insemination. It may appear unconventional but searching for sperm donors on Craigslist is not unheard of. In 2010, the popular cafemom blog lit up in outrage after a man from Beaverton, Oregon advertised his sperm donor services on Craigslist. He wrote: 'I'm ready to help.

However the site 'does not control, is not responsible for and makes no representations or warranties with respect to any user content...

Ms Bauer and Ms Schreiner, who separated in 2010, plan to help Mr Marotta fight the state's decision, saying they are 'forever grateful' for the child he gave their family. Ms Bauer, from Topeka, told cjonline.com this week: 'We’re kind of at a loss. We are going to support him in whatever action he wants to go forward with.' Hannah Schroller, Mr Marotta's attorney, argued that the case was consistent with a 2007 case in which the Kansas Supreme Court denied parental rights to a man who sought them after providing a sperm donation under similar circumstances. A licensed physician performed the insemination in the 2007 case. Schroller wrote that Marotta took the same actions as the man in the 2007 case did, and he - like that man - should be considered a sperm donor, not a father. She stressed that sperm banks regularly ship donations for the intended purpose of artificial insemination within the United States and abroad to both residential and medical facility addresses. Schroller argued in court documents that if a donor is free of parental responsibility only when a doctor performs an insemination, 'then any woman in Kansas could have sperm donations shipped to her house, inseminate herself without a licensed physician and seek out the donor for financial support because her actions made him a father, not a sperm donor. 'This goes against the very purpose of the statute to protect sperm donors as well as birth mothers'. Ms Bauer and Ms Schreiner had been together for eight years and adopted eight children. They ended their relationship in 2010 but continue to co-parent their . sons and daughters who range from three months to 25 years old. The . state of Kansas does not recognize same-sex unions, so each of their . children was registered for adoption by a single parent. A motion to dismiss the state's case will be heard in Shawnee County District Court on January 8. Angela de Rocha, spokeswoman for the . Department for Children and Families, said that Kansas law . prevented her from commenting on the case.

"Detroit's top law enforcement officer has been suspended amid allegations that he had a sexual . relationship with a subordinate. Chief Ralph Godbee's affair with Angelica Robinson, an internal . affairs officer, emerged after she posted a photo with her service weapon in her mouth on Twitter, after learning Godbee was at a police conference with another woman. Godbee had other officers locate the 37-year-old and put her under surveillance after seeing her photo. Shocking photo: Angelica Robinson posted this image after finding out that Detroit Police Chief Ralph Godbee was seeing another woman . Her attorney, David Robinson has confirmed that there was a relationship between his client and Chief Godbee, who is married but filed for divorce in August, according to myFoxDetroit.com. She now refers to herself as Godbee's former lover, and claims he is a 'sex addict,' the news website reports. 'There was a sexual relationship between my client and . Godbee,' Robinson told The Associated Press. 'She was trying . to end the relationship, and Godbee didn't want to let it go.' With regards the images his client posted on Twitter, Robinson added; 'Obviously, it raised the implication of suicide.' 'The story is that she was hurt he was at a conference with . another woman. Certainly this has created a lot of pressure. Unfairly, her . future is a little bit uncertain. She has to suffer the humiliation.' Angelica Robinson has been reassigned from internal affairs . to other duties. Her gun has since been taken away as she undergoes evaluation, myFoxDetroit.com reports. This is the second time in two years that a Detroit police . chief has been embroiled in scandal. Godbee's predecessor, Warren Evans, was fired by Mayor Dave Bing in . 2010 partly because he was romantically involved with a female officer. Detroit Police Chief Ralph Godbee has been suspended after allegations that he was involved in a relationship with Angelica Robinson . 'After learning of the allegations regarding Chief Ralph . Godbee, I have placed him on a 30-day suspension pending a full and thorough . investigation of this matter,' the mayor said in a statement Tuesday that did . not specify the allegations. Godbee could not be reached Tuesday afternoon for comment, . police spokeswoman Sgt. Eren Stephens said. Angelica Robinson, who is married, told her attorney the . relationship with Godbee lasted about a year. Godbee is separated from his . wife. David Robinson said the relationship was consensual. Without being specific, Robinson said he will approach the . city 'and see what their position would be and hopefully (the city will) do the . right thing' in regard to his client. 'The chief of police exceeded his professional status,' David Robinson said. 'He's breached the trust of the department.' Godbee and Bing have been assailed by officers in recent . weeks over a 10 percent pay cut and implementation of 12-hour workdays to help . cut millions of dollars from the police budget. Officers complain the cuts and . new work rules are too much to take in a city with one of the highest violent . crime rates in the country. The 287 murders committed through Sept. 23 in Detroit are 26 . more than at the same point last year. Godbee was named chief in 2010 after Bing fired Evans. Evans, a former Wayne County sheriff, was appointed chief by . Bing in 2009 and fired after he raised the mayor's ire by taking part in a . promotional video for a cable police reality show. Bing later said he also fired . Evans because the chief was romantically involved with Lt. Monique . Patterson. Godbee, too, had a romantic relationship with Patterson . before she began dating Evans and when she was Godbee's subordinate. The prior relationship between Godbee and Patterson was . disclosed publicly after Godbee was named interim chief, and Bing issued a . strongly worded statement after its disclosure saying he wasn't considering . firing Godbee for having an affair with a subordinate. Godbee, 44, joined the department in 1987 and rose to . assistant chief in 2007. He later retired only to be reappointed assistant chief . in July 2009 when Evans was hired.

"Glacial ice in the Peruvian Andes that took at least 1,600 years to form has melted in just 25 years, scientists have discovered. Researchers visiting Peru's Quelccaya Ice Cap have released a stunning pair of images to show the dramatic change. They were also able to obtain ice core samples from the area and track plant life as it moved into previously glacial areas.Two annually dated ice cores drawn from the tropical Peruvian Andes reveal Earth's tropical climate history in unprecedented detail—year by year, for nearly 1,800 years. Qori Kalis Glacier is the largest outlet glacier flowing off the Quelccaya ice cap: this collage shows the retreat of the Qori Kalis (1978 versus 2008) over 30 years . Researchers at The Ohio State University retrieved the cores from a Peruvian ice cap in 2003, and then noticed some startling similarities to other ice cores that they had retrieved from Tibet and the Himalayas. 'These ice cores provide the longest . and highest-resolution tropical ice core record to date,' said Lonnie . Thompson, distinguished university professor of earth sciences at Ohio . State and lead author of the study. 'In . fact, having drilled ice cores throughout the tropics for more than 30 . years, we now know that this is the highest-resolution tropical ice core . record that is likely to be retrieved.'The cores will provide a permanent . record for future use by climate scientists, Thompson said. This is . very important, as plants captured by the advancing ice cap 6,000 years . ago are now emerging along its retreating margins, which shows that . Quelccaya is now smaller than it has been in six thousand years. 'The . frozen history from this tropical ice cap—which is melting away as . Earth continues to warm—is archived in freezers at -30ºC so that . creative people will have access to it 20 years from now, using . instruments and techniques that don't even exist today,' he said. What . a difference This 2002 photo of Quelccaya Ice Cap Right) is, taken from . the same spot as a previous photo in 1977, and clearly shows the . retreat of the ice wall's vertical margins. The team also plotted newly emerged plants growing where previously there was a glacier . Patterns in the chemical composition of certain layers matched up, even though the cores were taken from opposite sides of the planet. The cores provide a new tool for researchers to study Earth's past climate, and better understand the climate changes that are happening today. The new cores, drilled from Peru's Quelccaya Ice Cap, are special because most of their 1,800-year history exists as clearly defined layers of light and dark: light from the accumulated snow of the wet season, and dark from the accumulated dust of the dry season. Quelccaya in 2005 showing 2002 plant deposits in the newly-uncovered areas . They are also special because of where they formed, atop the high Andean altiplano in southern Peru. Most of the moisture in the area comes from the east, in snowstorms fueled by moist air rising from the Amazon Basin. But the ice core-derived climate records from the Andes are also impacted from the west—specifically by El Niño, a temporary change in climate, which is driven by sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific. 'We have been able to derive a proxy for sea surface temperatures that reaches back long before humans were able to make such measurements, and long before humans began to affect Earth's climate,' Thompson said. The team have drilled ice cores . from glaciers atop the most remote areas of the planet—the Chinese . Himalayas, the Tibetan Plateau, Kilimanjaro in Africa, and Papua . Indonesia among others—to gauge Earth's past climate. Each new core has provided a piece of . the puzzle, as the researchers measured the concentrations of key . chemicals preserved in thousands of years of accumulated ice. The remoteness of the site and the technology available at the time limited the quality of samples they could obtain, however. The nearest road was a two-day walk . from the ice cap, so they were forced to melt the cores in the field and . carry samples back as bottles of water. This made some chemical . measurements impossible, and diminished the time resolution available . from the cores. 'Due to the remoteness of the ice . cap, we had to develop new tools such as a light-weight drill powered . by solar panels to collect the 1983 cores. 'However, we knew there was much more information the cores could provide"" -Mosley-Thompson said. 'Now the ice cap is just a six-hour walk from a new access road where a freezer truck can be positioned to preserve the cores. 'So we can now make better dust measurements along with a suite of chemical analyses that we couldn't make before.'","Images show the astonishing differences - with the Quelccaya glacier left at its smallest for 6,000 years .

"He may be too young to drive a car, but he is already an old hand at operating diggers. Aged just five, Wang Shuhan has been filmed driving a digger on a construction site in central China. The youngster was captured on video calmly driving the yellow vehicle around the site in Whuan in Hubei province. Scroll down for video . Old hand: At the age of just five, Wang Shuhan is filmed driving a digger on a construction site in central China . He operated its wheel, gear stick and brakes, as well as using its scoop to pick up and move sand. Shuhan's father Wang Xuebing, who works on the site, said his son became interested in driving diggers after he regularly brought him to work with him. 'I sometimes explained to him the functions of the gears within . the compartment, and when he was three he asked me to have a try. Amazingly he did it,' he said. Xuebing said the youngster now see the excavator as a big toy and often pleads to drive it.

A new underground car park in the city of Yan'an in western China's Shaanxi province toppled over today after rainstorms undermined the building's foundations. Engineers claim the mass of water that flooded into the area could not have been foreseen, but they have been accused of failing to build proper foundations by local media. Driver: Shuhan's father Wang Xuebing, who works on the construction site, said his son became interested in driving diggers after he regularly brought him to work with him. He said he now see the excavator as a big toy . Keeping him safe: But in the interest of safety, Wang Xuebing added: 'I keep an eye on him when he runs it' Engineer An Meng, 52, said: 'We had finished the basic work and only needed to put the earth back around the side which would stop the water flooding down and eating away at the foundations. 'Because the site was still open all of the water in the area flooded into the hole and that turned the earth underneath into a liquid mass which quite simply couldn't support the car park.' As a result, the huge building tipped to one side and seemingly sunk into the ground. Council officials are now looking at whether they will need to demolish and rebuild the car park.

"Families need to pay more for food and have become 'far too used to paying too little', Masterchef judge Jay Rayner told MPs today. The food critic and author told a parliamentary committee that food was too cheap to support British farmers. He said: 'We pay too little. We're far too used to paying too little. And the only way we have at our disposal, I think, to secure a robust food supply is by investing in British farming and that does mean consumers pay more and look for that label.' Masterchef judge Jay Rayner told MPs that cheap food was costing the British farming industry and that consumers needed to pay more . Mr Rayner dismissed concerns that hiking the cost of food would hit the poor. He told MPs on the Environment Committee: 'If we stop talking about food poverty and address the issues that are causing poverty - social exclusion, benefits changes and so forth - that are forcing people into those positions then we're dealing with the issue at hand. 'Yes, we do need to pay more for food but if you focus on a thing called food poverty then you're not going to be looking at the bigger picture involving the whole population.' Mr Rayner, before the committee as it raised questions around food security with regards to demand, consumption and waste, said food supply should be regarded as a public utility. He said: 'I think we have to regard food supply as a public utility, and one that's almost more serious in some regards than gas or electricity. 'If gas or electricity was off for three days we'd get by. If food supply stopped for three days we'd, to repeat Lord Cameron's great line ... we are nine meals from anarchy. So it is a rather vital thing. 'There is a small group of very large companies to whom we have given free run of the retail food market. I mean 95% of the retail food market is controlled by nine companies. 'And I strongly believe that with that market share comes a massive social responsibility. They are custodians of the food supply, and the government of the day, the state, does have a role to mediate that supply, so that we can still guarantee a reasonable food supply given the challenges that lie outside our own borders.' Mr Rayner told MPs on the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs select committee that farmers were badly hit by cheap food . Mr Rayner dismissed concerns that hiking the cost of food would hit the poor and said growing food bank use was because of other problems in society . He added that it was time the UK started thinking 'very seriously' about introducing a form of sustainability measurement 'which forces businesses to be very clear and upfront about that sort of stuff and slapping it on the packet'. 'It has to be said I can't imagine why any food business would not do a whole lifecycle analysis of what it does. It's good business to know exactly what your footprint is. 'But we are now seeing a massive price war between the supermarkets. It may well require the involvement of government to make that sort of thing happen. 'I think you'd probably do it on a CO2 per kilo yield measure and then traffic light it.' But he added: 'I think it's fair to say anything that requires extra work and extra compliance is resisted by the supermarkets for business reasons.' Asked if buying locally produced food, for example at farmers markets, was simply an indulgence for the well-off or helped to secure the national food supply, Mr Rayner said: 'It has absolutely nothing to do with the national food supply. It is a cultural and aesthetic choice for the affluent middle classes. That is all it is. 'I think the most you could possibly say is that it connects you with the food supplier because people come along with wheel barrows and sell it off.'","Jay Rayner told MPs food was too cheap to support British farmers .

"Altai in southern Siberia sits right at the centre of Russia. But the tiny, mountainous republic has a claim to fame unknown until now - Native Americans can trace their origins to the remote region. DNA research revealed that genetic markers linking people living in the Russian republic of Altai, southern Siberia, with indigenous populations in North America. A study of the mutations indicated a lineage shift between 13,000 and 14,000 years ago - when people are thought to have walked across the ice from Russia to America. Altai in Siberia: A study of genetic markers in DNA showed that the lineage of Native Americans changed around 13-14,000 years ago - when people are thought to have walked across the Bering Strait . This roughly coincides with the period when humans from Siberia are thought to have crossed what is now the Bering strait and entered America. 'Altai is a key area because it's a place where people have been coming and going for thousands and thousands of years,' said Dr Theodore Schurr, from the University of Pennsylvania in the US. Among the people who may have emerged from the Altai region are the predecessors of the first Native Americans. Roughly 20-25,000 years ago, these prehistoric humans carried their Asian genetic lineages up into the far reaches of Siberia and eventually across the then-exposed Bering land mass into the Americas. 'Our goal in working in this area was to better define what those founding lineages or sister lineages are to Native American populations,' Schurr said. The region lies at the intersection of what is now Russia, Mongolia, China and Kazakhstan. An engraving of early native Americans from the 1500s: DNA research hints that their ancestors came from one tiny region in central Russia . Dr Schurr's team checked Altai DNA . samples for markers in mitochondrial DNA which is always passed on by . mothers, and Y chromosome DNA which sons inherit from their fathers. Because of the large number of gene markers examined, the findings have a high degree of precision. 'At this level of resolution we can see the connections more clearly,' Schurr said. Looking at the Y chromosome DNA, . the researchers found a unique mutation shared by Native Americans and . southern Altaians in the lineage known as Q. Mitochondrial DNA is found in tiny rod-like 'powerplants' in cells that generate energy. Both kinds of DNA showed links between Altaians and Native Americans. In the Y chromosome DNA, the researchers found a unique mutation shared by Native Americans and people from southern Altai. The findings are published today in the American Journal of Human Genetics. Calculating how long the mutations they noted took to arise, Schurr's team estimated that the southern Altaian lineage diverged genetically from the Native American lineage 13,000 to 14,000 years ago, a timing scenario that aligns with the idea of people moving into the Americas from Siberia between 15,000 and 20,000 years ago. Though it's possible, even likely, that more than one wave of people crossed the land bridge, Schurr said that other researchers have not yet been able to identify another similar geographic focal point from which Native Americans can trace their heritage. 'It may change with more data from other groups, but, so far, even with intensive work in Mongolia, they're not seeing the same things that we are,' he said.

"Pope Francis is set to grace the cover of Rolling Stone as he continues to capture the hearts and minds of worshippers across the world. The Pope features on the front page of the rock and roll magazine's new issue - with an accompanying article titled 'The times they are a-changin''. Dressed in white robes, he can be seen smiling at the camera while waving his right hand. Scroll down for video . Iconic: Pope Francis graced the cover of Rolling Stone in February showing just how famous throughout the world he has become . It comes as the 77-year-old Pontiff is accused of killing defenceless doves by releasing them from a Vatican window - with animal activists claiming they . inevitably get preyed upon by wild birds. Earlier . today, the Italian RSPCA equivalent was revealed to have declared in an . open letter that because doves are bred in captivity, the Pope's act of . releasing them is 'condemning them to certain death'. The . group appealed to Pope Francis to end the practice of releasing doves . from the window overlooking St Peter's Square, a day after a pair . of the peace symbols were attacked by a seagull and crow while a crowd . including thousands of children watched below. In contrast, Rolling Stone's cover article highlights the Pope's success at 'establishing himself as a people's Pope'. Off they fly: Francis was celebrating the prayer from the window of his studio overlooking St. Peter's Square . Off they fly: Francis was celebrating the prayer from the window of his studio overlooking St. Peter's Square . It comments on his 'noticeable break . from Vatican tradition', which has seen him 'present a more . all-inclusive attitude toward human rights'. The cover photo itself was taken by the magazine's contributing editor Mark Binelli, who visited the Vatican in person, according to Rolling Stone. During . his visit, Mr Binelli witnessed the Pope display his 'all-inclusive' attitude by . telling a congregation weathering a storm in the piazza that he . wished he could be with them. 'He seemed to really mean it,' Mr Binelli told the magazine. Yesterday, the National Animal Protection Agency . published an open letter reminding Pope Francis that domesticated . doves are easy prey for predators like gulls. Not getting away: A dove which was freed by children flanked by Pope Francis is attacked by a seagull . Watch out: A dove which was freed by children flanked by Pope Francis is chased by a black crow . ‘Do . not use animals and their lives anymore, for these already outdated . traditions,’ the animal protection agency, known as ENPA, said, adding . that freeing doves in Rome is like ‘condemning them to certain death.’ ‘Animals . born in captivity, not being wild animals, aren't able to recognize . predators as such and are thus incapable of fleeing from possible . dangerous situations,’ ENPA said, adding it was launching a signature . petition to garner the pope's attention. The two larger birds swooped on the . defenceless doves during the Pope’s weekly Sunday Angelus prayer in . front of tens of thousands of worshippers gathered in the Vatican. After . saying a prayer for Ukraine, where at least three people were killed . during the latest clashes that have seen Kiev in flames, the Pontiff . helped schoolchildren release the doves from the window of the Apostolic . Palace as a peace gesture. Crow fought the wings of a dove: While speaking at the window beforehand, Francis had appealed for peace in Ukraine, where anti-government protesters have died . But they were immediately attacked. The seagull pinned one . of the doves against the wall of the palace and pecked at its tail, but . was left with a mouthful of feathers as its victim made an escape. The . crow caught the smaller bird unawares, as it rested on a windowsill, . before pecking at it repeatedly.  Again, the victim managed to get away. Eventually both doves flew off, seemingly uninjured, to the relief of tens of thousands of onlookers. The release of the birds concludes the Vatican’s annual  Caravan of Peace event. Last year one of the doves was set upon by a gull, while in 2012 they simply flew back into the Apostolic Apartments. While speaking at the window . beforehand, Francis had appealed for peace in Ukraine, after at least . three people were killed during the latest clashes in the two-month . crisis.","Pope Francis graces the front page of the new issue of Rolling Stone .

"The prime minister of Finland has blamed Apple for the economic downturn his country is experiencing which saw it lose its AAA credit rating on Friday. Alexander Stubb said the remarkable success of the California-based tech giant has had a negative impact on his country’s two biggest industries - technology and paper. ‘We have two champions which went down,’ Stubb told CNBC on Monday. Alexander Stubb, left, has said on Monday that the remarkable success of California-based tech giant Apple has had a negative impact on his country’s two biggest industries - technology and paper. Nokia, right, was once the global market leader in mobile phone handsets but has been superseded by the likes of Apple . Not only has handset manufacturer Nokia suffered due to the success of smartphones such as the iPhone, but Finland’s paper industry has also fallen on hard times. The country is a key production site for Europe's biggest paper producers, UPM-Kymmene and Stora Enso, but Stubb said the success of tablet devices like the iPad had hit the sector hard. ‘A little bit paradoxically I guess one could say that the iPhone killed Nokia and the iPad killed the Finnish paper industry, but we'll make a comeback,’ he predicted. Once a global market leader in handsets, Nokia has struggled to compete with not only Apple, but also Google and Samsung. The Finnish company sold its entire phones business to Microsoft in April, after the two companies had worked together on several smartphones. The forest and paper industry has also been hit hard in recent years by the emergence of tablet computers and e-readers. The paper killer? The Finnish Forest Research Institute warned in its 2013 end of year report of a ‘poor situation’ for paper production in the country and the rise of tablets such as the iPad is to blame . The Finnish Forest Research Institute warned in its 2013 end of year report of a ‘poor situation’ for paper production in the country and predicted that it would continue to contract in 2014. Ratings agency Standard & Poor's downgraded Finland's sovereign debt rating from AAA to AA+ on Friday, citing persistent economic growth problems. The country has yet to return to its 2008 economic output levels and besides the problems in the mobile phone and paper industries, dwindling exports due to the euro zone crisis and the crisis over Ukraine were also blamed. Finland's 'downgrade reflects our view of the risk that the Finnish economy could experience protracted stagnation because of its aging population and shrinking workforce, weakening external demand, loss of global market share... and relatively rigid labour market,' S&P said in its report. Despite the depressed forecast, Stubb remained upbeat on both industries. ‘Forest is coming back in terms of bio energy and other things. And actually a new Nokia is emerged in terms of (Nokia) Networks,’ he said. ‘Usually what happens is that when you have dire times you get a lot of innovation and I think from the public sector our job is to create the platform for it.’ Germany and Luxembourg are the only euro states with a full set of top-grade ratings from all three main rating agencies.","Finland had its credit rating downgraded from AAA to AA+ on Friday .

"Tennis star Caroline Wozniacki says she was left 'shocked' after her ex-fiancé Rory McIlroy broke up with her over the telephone - but says she now intends to date a taller man. The 24-year-old, who this week clinched second place in the U.S Open, split with the world number one at the end of May this year, just days after the couple sent out their wedding invitations. At the time, the Northern Irish golfer said the end of the three-year relationship was 'mutual and amicable' - but now Ms . Wozniacki has revealed McIlroy broke up with her out of the blue during a . ten-minute call and did not even give her 'a face-to-face'. Scroll down for video . His loss! Caroline Wozniacki attends a Michael Kors show in NYC on Wednesday, left, and poses with fellow tennis star Serena Williams, right. She has described her shock at her break-up with Rory McIlroy . Speaking about the break-up for the first time, she told In Depth With Graham Bensinger on Yahoo! News: 'It was very hard because he made it very public from the start. He put out a press release so I didn’t have a choice, you know,  it just got put in my face. ‘Oh I was shocked. I thought at least, you know, I would get a face to face or something. But there was nothing – it was just a phone call and I did not hear from him again. '‘I don’t think you expect to find yourself in a situation like that, you can’t prepare yourself or your body for anything like that so I think I was in a bit of a shocked phase there for a while.’ During the interview, the 5ft 10in tennis ace also made an apparent dig at her ex-fiancé by saying she would next date someone 'tall' so that she can wear high heels. Dumped: McIlroy, pictured on Sunday, broke up with his fiancee on the telephone . Speaking about her ideal man, she said: ‘Someone who is fun to be around who doesn't take himself seriously. I would like a taller guy so I can wear my heels.' Ms Wozniacki was two inches taller than 5ft 8in McIlroy and usually wore flat shoes when they appeared together in public. After the break-up, Ms Wozniacki famously posted a picture of herself shopping with a friend in Istanbul wearing platform heels. She wrote: 'Out and about in Istanbul. It's been three years since I have worn high heels on a normal day out. #feelsgood #looksgood #shopping #highheels #sun'. Multi-millionaire . McIlroy, who won the coveted British Open in July, announced he and Ms . Wozniacki had split earlier this year because he was not ready for ‘all . that marriage entails’. He later said in a statement released through Dublin-based communications consultants that the 'problem is mine'. At . the time, he said it would be difficult to concentrate on the . tournament on the back of a public break-up. But days later, McIlroy . went on to win the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth. His form continued and, in July, he won the British Open by a clear margin, before going on to win the U.S. PGA Championship. He . later claimed that the break-up was the reason behind his unstoppable . form, saying: ‘I think what happened has been for the best in terms of . my golf. 'I’ve put a bit more time into it and it has refocused me. I mean, what else do I have to do now?' The couple, pictured here in April 2013, were together for almost three years and were reportedly due to tie the knot in November at the Rockefeller Centre, New York . Last days: McIlroy and Wozniacki were seen at a cafe in London just days before their split earlier this year . Mz Wozniacki, who is 5ft 10in, was uncomfortable with being taller than her ex-partner, something which she now makes no secret about . Meanwhile, Miss Wozniacki crashed out in the first round of the French Open. But ever since, she has made a remarkable comeback, and this week narrowly missed out on the  US Open title to her best friend Serena Williams. Yesterday she credited her resurgence on focusing on tennis and the support of female friends such as Miss Williams. She said: ‘I went to Miami after the French Open and Serena was there and we had a great time. 'I came back from that and I felt refreshed, I felt like a new self. I started practising towards Wimbledon and I was playing well ... I think you just have to take life as it goes and I believe you never get things put on you that you can’t handle. I’m definitely on the other side now – I’ve moved on.’ But she also seemed to hit out at her former fiance, suggesting McIlroy had found it hard to balance his career with their relationship. She added: ‘I think it is very important to have a life off the court and to me it wasn’t that hard to balance tennis and a relationship.’ After . two years together, McIlroy, who is worth an estimated £28million, . proposed to Wozniacki in Sydney, Australia, on New Year's Day with a . £120,000 diamond ring. In July, Ms Wozniacki posted this picture, saying she was wearing heels for the first time in three years. Wozniacki was taller than McIlroy in heels so often wore flat shoes . Shortly after the break-up, the tennis star was seen enjoying herself in Miami, Florida, with fellow tennis star, Serena Williams . The pair . experienced an on/off relationship during their time together, with . sources close to the couple claiming McIlroy broke it off with Ms . Wozniacki in April last year. They . eventually confirmed their engagement on New Year’s Day after McIlroy, . who also won the US Open in 2011 and the U.S. PGA Championship in 2012, . proposed during a fireworks show on New Year's Eve in Sydney. According to sources, their wedding was due to take place at the Rockefeller Centre in New York on November 8. At . the time of their engagement, Wozniacki, who is worth an estimated . £15m, posted a picture of the engagement ring on her Twitter account. Ms Wozniacki claimed second place in the U.S. Open earlier this week, losing in the final to her good friend . She wrote: 'Happy new year everyone! Rory and I started 2014 with a bang! ...I said YES!!!!' McIlroy then . shared the same picture and added: 'Happy New Year everyone! I have a . feeling it's going to be a great year!! My first victory of 2014 . #shesaidyes!!' But in the statement after their break-up, McIlroy said: 'The problem is mine. 'The wedding invitations issued at the weekend made me realise that I wasn't ready for all that marriage entails. 'I wish Caroline all the happiness she deserves and thank her for the great times we've had.' Ms Wozniacki, who was born in Denmark to Polish parents, became world number one in 2012. The pair confirmed they were engaged on New Year's Day by posting a series of pictures on Twitter, featuring her diamond ring . But after the break-up was announced, the tennis player tweeted saying: 'It's a hard time for me right now'. She referred to supporting Liverpool - a subtle reference to her ex-fiancé's love for Manchester Unite . McIlroy . suffered a difficult golfing season last year and said he had . considered seeing a sports psychologist to help overcome his issues. He is currently involved in a lengthy legal battle with his former management company in the courts in Dublin over commissions from his lucrative sports sponsorship and endorsement contracts.

"Lori Moore and her new boyfriend Lance Griffel were attending a high school reunion in an Illinois sports bar on Saturday when her ex-husband walked calmly inside and fatally shot them both. Incredibly, James Moore, 40, was prevented from committing mass-murder by a heroic off-duty FBI officer who shot the gunman dead at the Fifth Quarter Sports Bar and Pizzeria immediately after. Moore, 33, and Griffel, 36, were both rushed to hospital where they were pronounced dead after suffering gunshot wounds to the head. Tragedy: Lori Moore and Lance Griffel (both pictured) were shot dead in East Peoria in Illinois today by Moore's ex-husband, James Moore, 40 . The tragic couple were attending an East Peoria Community High School reunion for the class of 1999 when Moore walked in around 8 pm and shot them both in front of 100 stunned witnesses. 'After just a brief moment inside the bar, he pulled out a weapon and shot a female and a male,' said East Peoria Police Chief Dick Ganschow to the Pekin Times. 'He was subsequently shot.' Moore filed for a divorce from Jason A. Moore in March of 2013 and the dissolution of the marriage was finalized in May 2013. In a June 5 Facebook post, Lori Moore posed happily for a picture with Griffel, giving him the moniker, Sir Lancelot. Ganschow praised the quick thinking off-duty officer for their reaction to the shooter. 'It's very difficult to say. You can play the 'what if' game over and over again, but I think it's pretty clear in his case the presence of this officer and his ability to take very quick and very decisive action prevented a further tragedy,' said Ganschow.

Scene: The Fifth Quarter Sports Bar and Pizzeria in East Peoria, where the shooting happened on Saturday night . Ganschow said the crime scene has been released, but will remain closed to the public.

"Vice-president Joe Biden has controversially told an audience made up of several hundred black supporters that Mitt Romney would put them 'back in chains' with his Wall Street financial deregulation plans. The potentially inflammatory comments were made to an audience of 800 at the Institute for Advanced Learning and Research in Danville, Virginia, where the majority of people are African American. 'Romney wants to, he said in the first 100 days, he’s gonna let the big banks again write their own rules, unchain Wall Street,' said Mr .Biden, who then lowered his voice and added, 'They are going to put y'all back in chains.' Scroll Down for Video . Joe Biden drew the ire of the Mitt Romney camp after telling an audience that the Republican would put voters 'back in chains' with his Wall Street financial deregulation plans . Asked about the comments on MSNBC, President Obama's deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter said Mr.Obama 'probably agrees with Joe Biden's sentiments. 'I mean he's using a metaphor...He was making a point that if we repeal Wall Street reform which is what Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan want to do, we're going to go back to the days where they're writing their own rules, and we saw what happened. 'Taxpayers had to bail them out. 'We had to spend billions of dollars of taxpayer dollars bailing them out. 'Now I would think that that, you know, that is a problem for middle class taxpayers. 'That would hamper their ability to take care of their own finances.' Vice President Joe Biden made controversial statements while in Danville. More than 50 percent of the Virginian town's population is African American . Following Joe Biden's comments to the Institute for Advanced Learning and Research in Danville, Virginia, Republican commentators have called upon President Obama to apologise for his deputy . US President Barack Obama delivers a speech today during a campaign event at B.R. Miller Middle School in Marshalltown, Iowa, during his three-day campaign bus tour across the state . However, Mitt Romney's spokesperson Andrea Saul hit back, claiming that the Obama campaign had hit the gutter. 'In case anyone was wondering just how low President Obama could go in his campaign for re-election, we now know he's willing to say that Governor Romney wants to put people in chains,' said Saul. Democrats rushed to defence of Mr. Biden claiming that his metaphor was taken out of context and that he was talking in purely financial terms . President Barack Obama speaks during a campaign event at the Nelson Pioneer Farm & Museum, Tuesday, Aug. 14, 2012, in Oskaloosa, Iowa, during his three day campaign bus tour through Iowa . President Obama was treated to chants of 'Four More Beers' as he purchased himself a drink at the Iowa State Fair yesterday . 'Whether its accusing Mitt Romney of . being a felon, having been responsible for a woman's tragic death or now . wanting to put people in chains, there's no question that because of . the President's failed record he's been reduced to a desperate campaign . based on division and demonisation.' As the controversy over Mr. Biden's comments grew, Saul called on the President to distance himself from his deputies comments. 'After weeks of slanderous and baseless accusations leveled against Governor Romney, the Obama Campaign has reached a new low,' press secretary Andrea Saul said in a statement. 'The comments made by the Vice President of the United States are not acceptable in our political discourse and demonstrate yet again that the Obama Campaign will say and do anything to win this election. 'President Obama should tell the American people whether he agrees with Joe Biden’s comments.' Rush Limbaugh also waded into the controversy. 'They’re going to put y’all back in chains, he says to a . predominantly black audience. They’re going to put y’all back in chains. And, of course, the reaction, ‘Oh that’s just Joe. That’s just Joe,' said the right-wing radio host. 'He . sees a guy in a wheelchair, ‘Stand up Chuck! Oh God bless you, what . have I done. Everybody stand up for Chuck.’ 'He’s a walking buffoon and . Obama knows it. They all know it. But it’s getting to the point it’s too . late to do anything about it. … Is Obama going to be in chains? That’s a . good question. Good question. Is Ryan going to put chains back on . Obama?' Republican's such as Ari Fleischer, George W. Bush's press secretary took to Twitter to denounce the comments. 'The press pounded (Sarah) Palin when she talked about 'blood libel'..,what will they do about Biden's 'chains' remark.' And as an interesting conclusion to his speech, Mr.Biden appeared to forget where he was. He thanked those who had come to hear him speak and told them that with their help they 'can win North Carolina again.' Biden had seemed to forget that he was speaking in Virginia. August 2012: Joe Biden told an audience made up of several hundred black supporters in Danville, Virginia, that a win for Mitt Romney would put them 'back in chains' with his Wall Street financial deregulation plans.January 2012: During  speech at a manufacturing plant in New Hampshire the vice president spoke about outsourcing to India and put on a bad Indian accent while asking 'How many times do you get the call, 'I like to talk to you about your credit card.'December 2010: During the swearing in of a Republican Senator Mark Kirk in Congress, Biden told the Capitol Hill newcomer to put that hand on the Bible and raise his left.  According to the congressional rulebook, it should have been the other way round.March 2010: He dropped the F-bomb during the signing of the administration’s historic health reforms, apparently unaware that the microphones would catch him out when he whispered into the President’s ear immediately before the announcement, declaring: 'This is a big f****** deal!'March 2010: Mr Biden said 'God rest her soul' in reference to the mother of Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen. Mr Cowen's mother is alive; his father had died. Realising his misstep, he corrected with: 'God bless her soul'.October 2008: Speaking in Athens, Ohio about John McCain's economic strategy, he said: 'Look, John's last-minute economic plan does nothing to tackle the number-one job facing the middle class, and it happens to be, as Barack says, a three-letter word: jobs. J-O-B-S, jobs.'September 2008: During a political rally in Missouri, he urged wheelchair-bound state senator Chuck Graham to rise and be recognised, saying: 'Stand up, Chuck, let 'em see ya.' Realizing his mistake, he said: ‘Oh, God love you… what am I talking about?’September 2008: After he was named the vice presidential nominee, he addressed a crowd in Nashua, New Hampshire, questioning how he beat out Hillary Clinton: 'Hillary Clinton is as qualified or more qualified than I am to be vice president of the United States of America,' he said in New Hampshire. 'Quite frankly it might have been a better pick than me.'August 2008: He also mixed up Barack Obama’s name at his first campaign rally with the president, introducing him as: 'A man I'm proud to call my friend.

A Romney aide who was not authorized to speak for the record said the event is closed to the media because it is a 'finance meeting' instead of a fundraiser.

A study has found women with more of the additives in their system are more likely to say no to sex . Phthalates are man-made chemicals thought to interfere with the natural hormones that are crucial to overall health. They are found in everything from PVC flooring and shower curtains to car dashboards – and may also be in our food. Tiny particles can enter our systems either through breathing or eating. Previous studies have linked them to diabetes and asthma. They have also been blamed for feminising the brains of baby boys and last year the World Health Organisation warned they have ‘serious implications for health’. The latest research, presented at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine’s annual conference in Honolulu, suggests they are doing psychological, as well as physical, damage. In the first study of its kind, Dr Emily Barrett, of the University of Rochester School of Medicine in the US, measured levels of phthalates in the urine of 360 pregnant women in their 20s and 30s. She also asked them how often they lost interest in sex in the months leading up to their pregnancy. Those with the most phthalates in their bodies were two and a half times as likely to say they had frequently lacked interest in sex as those with the least. She said: ‘It is interesting because these are chemicals that we are all exposed to every day. They are throughout our environment and every person studied showed measurable levels.’ Scientists are now warning the chemicals could have serious health risks (file image) Dr Barrett suspects that phthalates interfere with the production of sex hormones oestrogen and testosterone, both of which are involved in female libido. She said that learning more is of ‘utmost importance’, adding: ‘For a lot of women with loss of libido there is no obvious reason and it is important to know how these chemicals might contribute.’ She said that food is a significant source of phthalates, particularly processed and highly-packaged products. It is thought to get into into food from processing equipment and from packaging. Dr Barrett, who tried to avoid fast food when pregnant over fears that the chemicals it contains would harm her unborn baby, said: ‘One of the recommendations... to potentially lower your exposure is to eat less processed food and to pick fresh things without packaging.’ Other advice includes choosing natural wooden flooring over PVC and switching plastic shower curtains for glass screens. Elizabeth Salter Green, director of campaign group CHEM Trust, said it is ‘highly likely’ that phthalates are also found in British food. She said our exposure to them is ‘constant’ because they are used in so many products. However relationship expert Dr Pam Spurr said many factors can influence a woman’s libido, including smoking, medication, having a baby or changing jobs. A spokesman for the Chemical Industries Association, which represents manufacturers, said: ‘We are not aware of any globally accepted tests which can yet measure the effect chemical exposure may have on libido.’ He added that phthalates are among the most researched chemicals and the use of any that affect fertility is restricted. Certain phthalates are banned from use in cosmetics, toiletries and toys in the EU and further restrictions are due next year.","PVC flooring and plastic shower curtains could lower women's libido .

"The ‘tyranny’ of capitalism is leading to widespread social unrest, the Pope warned yesterday. In his first major teaching document, Pope Francis, 76, said inequality would inevitably lead to conflict resulting in ‘disintegration and death’. He used his 84-page ‘apostolic exhortation’ to call for an overhaul of the financial system in Western economies that promote ‘unbridled consumerism’. Anti-capitalism: Francis has previously expressed his disdain for Western capitalism, calling for a more ethical banking system and curbs on financial speculation . Pope Francis said: ‘As long as the . problems of the poor are not radically resolved by rejecting the . absolute autonomy of markets and financial speculation and by attacking . the structural causes of inequality, no solution will be found for the . world’s problems.’ The document, known as an apostolic exhortation, builds on views the pontiff has aired since his election in March. Poverty and peace: Since his enthronement Francis has repeatedly called for 'a poor church' Francis . has previously expressed his disdain for Western capitalism, calling . for a more ethical banking system and curbs on financial speculation. He . even wrote to David Cameron ahead of the G8 summit in Northern Ireland . reminding him that money should serve mankind and rather than the . reverse. Since his enthronement Francis has repeatedly called for ‘a poor church’. He immediately ditched the traditional . scarlet slippers and golden cross for a plain iron cross and his . battered old black brogues from Buenos Aires. And . he has continued to live by example eschewing the grand Papal . apartments for a room in a humble priest’s boarding house, travelling in . a Ford Focus, and suspending a bishop who spent millions of euros on . his luxurious residence. He even chose the name Francis after the medieval saint who renounced his riches for a life of poverty. The document said that the inequality and injustice of capitalism would eventually lead to an explosion. He . wrote ‘When a society – whether local, national or global – is willing . to leave a part of itself on the fringes, no political programmes or . resources spent on law enforcement or surveillance systems can . indefinitely guarantee tranquillity. ‘Without . equal opportunities the different forms of aggression and conflict will . find a fertile terrain for growth and eventually explode.’ Foreboding: The document said that the inequality and injustice of capitalism would eventually lead an explosion . He called for action 'beyond a simple welfare mentality' and added: 'I beg the Lord to grant us more politicians who are genuinely disturbed by the state of society, the people, the lives of the poor.' The exhortation, presented in the pope's trademark clear and warm style, in contrast with the academic writings of his predecessor, also calls for devolution of the church, with more power for bishops to decide doctrine for their diocese. He reiterated earlier statements that the Church cannot ordain women or accept abortion. The male-only priesthood, he said, 'is not a question open to discussion' but women must have more influence in Church leadership.","Francis made remarks in first major work he has authored alone as pope .

"Labour peer Lord Sugar tonight called for Gordon Brown to replace Ed Miliband as leader . Celebrity Labour peer Lord Sugar has called for Ed Miliband to be replaced as party leader – by Gordon Brown. The Apprentice star said Mr Brown had been handed a ‘bad deal’ after taking over as Prime Minister from Tony Blair in 2007 just before the economic crash. Lord Sugar welcomed the former PM’s return to the Commons today – where he spearheaded the Labour’s opposition to Tory plans to ban Scottish MPs voting on English laws. He added: ‘I wish he’d come back as leader of the Labour Party to be honest with you.’ He told Iain Dale’s LBC radio show: ‘He took over from Blair in 2008 or 2007 when the real problems in the world economy broke and he got the blame, as far as England is concerned. ‘It’s absolutely wrong. It wasn’t his fault.’ The remarks come amid mounting pressure on Mr Miliband’s leadership following his disastrous party conference speech in which he forgot to mention the deficit. In the wake of the speech some polls put the Tories ahead of Labour – leaving some backbench MPs worrying about the chances of holding on to their seats at the next election. Mr Miliband addressed Labour MPs last night for the first time since the party scraped to victory over Ukip by 600 votes in the Heywood and Middleton by-election. In the wake of the result there were growing calls for the party to take a harder stance against immigration. He told the MPs that the party's chances of winning the next election would 'slip away’ unless they stop sniping at his leadership. In a desperate plea for unity, Mr Miliband appealed to MPs to rally behind his faltering leadership – or risk being punished by the voters in May. Addressing a private meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party at Westminster last night, he insisted victory was ‘do-able’, but said: ‘Normally after an election defeat we show disunity and division. ‘Instead, we have had four years of unity. I am not going to let us, seven months before an election, start lapsing into the bad habits of the past. ‘Things are going to be more difficult. There will be ups and downs which make the last few weeks look easy. I know that we will pass that test.’ Mr Miliband was given a polite hearing by most MPs, although several attacked him over the party’s slump in the polls and failure to address the Ukip challenge on immigration. But the Labour leader said the party could not ‘out-Ukip Ukip’. He insisted Labour had the right policies on immigration and told MPs they needed to just ‘keep going on at it’, a source told MailOnline. Scroll down for video . Labour leader Ed Miliband last night issued a 'call to arms' to his party's MPs to back his leadership ahead of the next election . One MP said: ‘He said immigration was obviously an issue, but there’s more to it. He said there was a deeper malaise with the main political parties. ‘If there is an issue around immigration we can’t just out Ukip Ukip. He said our policy was correct and we needed to keep going on at it.’ Another MP at the meeting said Mr Miliband told them it was no good offering ‘quick fixes’ and called on the party to keep pushing Labour’s message on immigration. In a thinly veiled rebuke to Labour MPs calling for the party to talk more about immigration Mr Miliband also told the meeting that ‘describing the problem is not a solution’.","Lord Sugar hails Gordon Brown adding: 'I wish he’d come back as leader'

"Proud father: Jason Robert Bell has spoken about birth of son Ajax . They spent weeks grooming the media for the maximum publicity they could get. But now it appears that the . performance artist who gave birth in front of a gallery audience has . become rather shy of the attention she is receiving. Marni Kotak said that she did not expect the amount of interest for her ‘work’ and that she is finding it hard to cope whilst nursing her first child. Her husband Jason Robert Bell . revealed she is ‘totally afraid’ whilst their friends claimed she feels . like there is a ‘bounty on the picture of her first child’. Mr Bell confessed that ‘artists like attention because it pays the bills’ but denied that their motivation was to be famous. He also revealed that his and Miss . Kotak’s families had a ‘mixed’ reaction to their plans and that none of . them had even been informed by them when it was happening - so none . attended the event. Ajax Bell was born at the tiny Microscope Gallery in Brooklyn, New York weighing 9lbs 2oz on Tuesday at 10.17am. Miss Kotak - who said giving birth is . the 'highest form of art' - had set up a home-birth centre at the . gallery and turned it into a brightly decorated bedroom with ocean blue . walls and photo-imprinted pillows, along with a shower. According to those who attended, the . space was ‘steamy’ and after Ajax was born the placenta was put in a . bowl that had been lying around. Among the invited onlookers and ‘art friends’ were a couple expecting a baby who wanted to see what a birth would be like. Mr Bell revealed that the entire . process lasted around 24 hours - he and Miss Kotak, 36, arrived around . 5pm on the Monday and left at 6pm or 7pm on the next day following the . morning birth. Art: The website of The Microscope Gallery in Brooklyn, New York, where Marni Kotak gave birth announced that the child was a healthy baby boy, weighing 9lbs 2oz . Around 20 people were there for the . Ajax’s arrival and they helped to clean up and bring food to the new . mother - including a Chinese takeaway dinner of sesame chicken with . broccoli. A midwife they had hired was present . but there were no medicines and it was a natural birth which caused Miss . Kotak ‘the worst pain in her life’. Mr Bell, 39, said the couple hardly slept on the first night of having their child at home and were exhausted. He added that his wife was ‘very . surprised by all the attention’ it had received - even though the event . had been featured extensively in the media. Shuttered: The gallery was closed Wednesday after Tuesday's 'exhibit', titled The Birth of Baby X, and it's website said it would reopen with normal business hours on Thursday . ‘Marni has been doing things like this for years and no-one has cared,’ he said. ‘Restaging funerals and doing all . things that were very public/private and stuff.  Things that she thought . would be crazy.  She’s a performance artist, she went to school for . performance art, she’s been doing performance art for over 10 years. ‘Artists like attention because it . pays the bills. There’s much easier ways to get attention than give . birth in public, that’s pretty crazy doing it for that reason. ‘If you were doing this would be you . doing it in some lackadaisical silly manner? Would you be doing this . just to seek attention? That’s kind of monstrous to do that. ‘My wife has integrity. There’s a . history of people that do stuff like this in galleries and what’s . interesting in all the past one, it’s like: ‘This guy shot a dog in an . art gallery’, this guy got shot by someone in an art gallery, but this . wasn’t somebody getting hurt in a gallery, this was a positive thing. ‘That’s the difference.’ Scene of the birth: The Microscope Gallery in Bushwick, Brooklyn, turned into a makeshift maternity Tuesday ward when Marni Kotak gave birth to her son Ajax, in front of a crowd of 20 non-relatives . He added that some people said some ‘really nasty stuff’ on the Internet which had upset them. He said: ‘Now she (Miss Kotak) is . totally afraid because she didn’t understand it was going to be in the . news. She didn’t understand it was going to freak people out.’ Speaking from his home in Brooklyn near to the gallery, Mr Bell described himself and his wife as ‘just two Bohemian artists’. He admitted that both his and his wife’s family only found out about their plans through news reports and not from themselves. He said: ‘The family did not express an interest in being there but they were interested afterwards. My brother said afterward: ‘Why didn’t you tell me?’ ‘Overall there was a mixed reaction. My mum thought it was pretty cool that the birth of her grandson was international news’. Mr Bell said he chose the name Ajax . as an ‘intelligence test’ to see if people how people would react:  - if . they said the detergent instead of the Greek God then he knew they an . idiot . If Ajax had been a girl he would have been called Xara. All set: Marni is now terrified of the media attention but her painter-artist husband Jason Robert Bell spoke briefly Wednesday . Among those who saw the birth was . Katarina Hybenova who wrote on bushwickdaily.com that Miss Kotak . experienced the 'unforgettable moment' surrounded by a 'handful of . randomly chosen participants'. She said: 'I was one of the lucky . ones attending, and the atmosphere in the gallery was magical. I believe . that all of the participants were deeply moved by this emotional, raw . and true 'piece of art'. 'I feel like the entire audience accomplished this together with Marni, using the commonly created positive energy.' Araceli Cruz, of the VillageVoice blog, said she just missed out on witnessing the birth. She also revealed, in a post that the baby measured 21 inches long. She said: 'We first received notice that the baby was coming soon at 9.34am and rushed to the quaint gallery. 'Although we were one of the select . few to attend the live birth, an art performance/installation by Marni . Kotak, we, unfortunately, didn't arrive in time. 'What we did find when we entered the . steamy space, which the artist converted into a birthing centre, was . Kotak calmly eating a banana, the placenta in a bowl and the baby's . father, Jason, holding his son who was wrapped in a blue towel. 'The beautiful baby boy was . wide-eyed, and as quiet as could be, staring blankly into the camera and . video lenses that hovered above him. A video of the birth will be added to . forthcoming exhibition at the gallery, and forms the start of an 18 . year project which called Raising Baby X, where Miss Kotak will document . her child's upbringing until college with weekly video podcasts. Marni laughs as her artist-painter husband Jason Bell, plays with a rubber ball that is part of the birthing room . She launched the exhibition on . October 8 and the gallery's opening hours were extended so that she . could develop a rapport with members of the public. The Microscope gallery  is a scruffy building located in a downtrodden part of Bushwick in Brooklyn. The one storey structure appears to be an extension of the house next to it and has a flat roof crudely fashioned out of metal. On the front are three black metal shutters and a black metal bench sits outside. On one side is a photographer’s . studio space and on the other a coffee shop which has been covered in . graffiti, but over the road is what appears to be a car dump being . guarded by an elderly man and his dog. Further down the road is a small patch of wasteland whilst round the corner is a Family Dollar discount store and a KFC. Whilst Miss Kotak’s friends have been unsurprisingly supportive, not all of those living close to the gallery were behind her. Ari Sneider, 26, who lives very close . to the gallery and runs a moped shop down the road, said: ‘This is just . exploiting the child for the benefit of his parents. ‘Nobody had heard of their small gallery in Brooklyn before this, and now everyone knows where it is. ‘The baby did not have any say in how he came into this world – how do we know this is what he would have wanted. ‘Kids can be really mean and if there is anything different about them they get teased, and this kid is going to get teased. ‘By the time he gets old enough to understand it then he won’t be old enough to care, but then it will be too late. ‘I think it’s attention seeking and, even in our age of sharing everything on the Internet, a step too far’. Ready: The gallery has been converted into a birthing room for Marni . But Henry Glucroft, 26, one of the . owners of the Little Skips cafe next door to the Microscope Gallery, . said that he knew Miss Kotak and respected what she did. He said: ‘I think it is challenging our idea about where we can be born and how it takes place. ‘If this had happened in the Upper East Side (of New York) there would be uproar, but people here are different and accepting’. He also admitted that in a gallery . was ‘not where I want my child to be born’, but that he thought the . attention was ‘good for our neighbourhood’. A friend of Miss Kotak said that the . couple did not really understand the mess they were getting into and may . have done things differently in hindsight. The friend said: ‘She feels like there’s a bounty on the first picture of her child . ‘Perhaps she should have, could have thought about this a bit more and realised what would happen after the birth. ‘She and Jason are now finding it . very difficult to cope with all of this attention whilst dealing with a . newborn baby. They’ve had enough’. The friend denied that Miss Kotak was . being hypocritical, but admitted that ‘they might not have fully . realised what they let themselves in for’.","Brooklyn parents didn't notify their relatives before the birth of their son .

"Beijing officials this week warned children and the elderly to stay indoors due severe smog. It has become a major problem in China's capital city and elsewhere in the country - forcing closures, damaging health and reducing visibility to less than 10 metres. The solution, according to Dutch designer Daan Roosegaarde, is to use an electronic vacuum cleaner to clean up the air. Scroll down for videos . A woman wearing a mask checks her mobile phone during a smoggy day on the square in front of Harbin's landmark church, in Heilongjiang . Difficult to see: Buildings are shrouded in heavy fog in Shengyang, China. A heavy smog shrouded Harbin yesterday for the second straight day, forcing the closure of schools and highways . Walking on: A woman wearing a mask walk through a street covered by dense smog in Harbin, northern China . Uphill battle: Visibility shrank and small-particle pollution soared to a record 40 times higher than an international safety standard in the northern Chinese city as the region entered its high-smog season . Roosegaarde has been working with the mayor of Beijing to use the technology in a new park in the city, according to Dezeen. The system uses copper coils to create an electrostatic field that attracts smog particles to clean the air. This creates holes of clean air through the smog which can be as large as 60 metres, according to Mr Roosegaarde. ‘It's a similar principle to if you have a statically charged balloon that attracts your hair,’ Mr Roosegaarde told Dezeen. From above: This NASA satellite image shows haze over northeastern China. Choking clouds of pollution blanketed Harbin, in China's Heilongjiang province, which is famed for its annual ice festival .

This creates gigantic holes of clean air in the sky, which can be as large as 60 metres, according to Roosegaarde. The coils can be buried beneath the grass of a park and are release no toxic residues. He added that the coils can be buried beneath the grass of a park and release no toxic residues. This combination of high-tech and imagination is what Mr Roosegaarde calls ‘techno-poetry’. Mr Roosegaarde's company has been working with scientists at the University of Delft to unveil a working prototype of the system. He now plans to spend a year and a half developing the technology before deploying it in a park in Beijing. The .

"From Wayne Rooney to James Nesbitt, the list of celebrity men who have resorted to hair transplants to revitalise their balding manes is a long one. As a result, inquiries about the treatment have shot up by 260 per cent over the last 12 months while 59 per cent of men say they would consider the treatment if they started losing their hair. But as Michael Avola, 49, an unemployed former martial arts champion from Northampton knows only too well, the fiddly surgery doesn't always go to plan. Botched: Michael Avola, 49, was left bald and scarred following six bungled hair transplant operations . Embarrassed: Mr Avola, who is unemployed, said his confidence was wrecked by the bungle . After he began losing his hair - and his confidence - at the age of 23, he turned to surgery in a bid to fix the problem. But six operations and £7,000 later, Mr Avola was left badly scarred and still bald. 'They promised me there would be a . really good result,' he reveals. 'They said the scarring would be invisible and that there would . be full coverage at the front.' Instead, after a bungling surgeon botched the operation, Mr Avola was left with a small amount of wiry regrowth and a front section without any hair on it at all. 'It . looked horrendous,' he adds. 'It was growing like wire. Emotionally, I was just . broken.' The complex surgery, which involves carefully removing and then re-implanting up to 1500 delicate hair follicles, was repeated five times before Mr Avola conceded defeat. Shockingly, despite confronting the inept medic, the clinic refused to refund his money or compensate him for the damage. 'I went back and explained to them that, really, they'd wrecked . my life and nothing happened,' he explains. He adds: 'Every day, when I leave the house, I try to wear a hat if I can help it. You go through all the emotions... You get embarrassed, you get angry because you think, ""How could I do such a stupid thing?""' Painful: The back of his head was left badly scarred by the surgeon's attempts to harvest follicles . Celebrity fans: Wayne Rooney has confessed to having two hair transplants, while James Nesbitt has had one . Mr Avola, who appears in the latest episode of Channel 5 documentary, Botched Up Bodies, is now attempting to repair the damage by consulting another surgeon but may have to wait up to 18 months before his mangled hair grows back. 'I would have expected to see a lot more hair growing on his head considering the amount of surgery he's had,' comments Manchester-based hair restoration surgeon, Dr Bessam Farjo. 'I think the operations Michael has had, certainly in my opinion, are below par. One, because he's had multiple scars where he should have had one or two scars. Painful: Hair transplants involve having up to 1500 hair follicles extracted and re-inserted into the scalp . 'Second, because there's not enough hairs growing from one operation, let alone six, and thirdly, the hairs that are growing, the size of the grafts, the angles and directions are not giving him a natural appearance.' Although Mr Avola has since had a seventh operation in the professional hands of Dr Farjo, he still has more than a year to go before finding out whether his hopes of a full head of hair will be realised. 'It's been an improvement and hopefully it will progress a bit more,' he says, adding: 'I'm very excited about the future.' Michael Avola appears on Botched Up Bodies, Thursday night at 10pm on Channel 5 .","Michael Avola, 49, was scarred and still bald after a botched hair transplant .

"Nearly 50,000 Romanians and Bulgarians applied to work in Britain in the first three months of this year, dramatic new official figures showed yesterday. A total of 34,904 Romanians and 10,445 Bulgarians registered for National Insurance numbers in January, February and March – the first three months after the lifting of employment restrictions on migrant workers from the two countries. The new statistics severely undermine claims made last week that the number of Romanians and Bulgarian workers in the country actually fell in the first months of this year. Scroll down for video . Nearly 50,000 Romanians and Bulgarians applied to work in Britain in the first three months of this year. Among the first to arrive earlier this year was Romanian Victor Spirescu. Landing at Luton Airport on New Year's Day, he was greeted by Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs committee . In the run-up to the European elections, the BBC claimed there were 4,000 fewer Romanian and Bulgarian workers in Britain in March than in January, and its political editor scoffed: ‘So much for those predictions of a flood of immigrants coming from Romania and Bulgaria once the door to the UK was opened.’ However the evidence used by the BBC and others was drawn from Office for National Statistics (ONS) surveys widely regarded as being flawed. The National Insurance number record – which provides an accurate count of exactly who has applied to work in this country – told an entirely different story when published yesterday, the day of the elections. In the year to March, 46,890 Romanians applied for the National Insurance qualification, up by 163 per cent on the 17,820 who applied in the previous 12 months. Bulgarian applications went up by 71 per cent over the 12 months to 17,750. National Insurance registrations by Romanians in the first three months of this year are nearly double those for the whole of 2013. The ONS said 30 per cent of those registering in 2014 had been in Britain for more than a year and 22 per cent had registered within three months of arriving in Britain. In the year to March, 46,890 Romanians applied for the National Insurance qualification, up by 163 per cent on the 17,820 who applied in the previous 12 months . ‘This indicates that the January to . March registration figures are actually reflecting migration over an . extended period,’ it said. However it may also indicate that . Romanians and Bulgarians who had been working illegally in Britain . seized the chance to become lawfully employed in January. The . MigrationWatch think-tank, which projected that 50,000 Romanians and . Bulgarians would arrive each year now that their citizens were free to . work in this country, said the National Insurance figures backed up its . analysis. The . ONS figures claimed that a total of 140,000 people born in Romania and . Bulgaria were employed in Britain in the first three months of the year . and Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, said its . findings ‘give the lie to Ukip’s scaremongering on immigration’. However, the National Insurance figures show that between the spring of 2002 and the spring of 2014, there were nearly 300,000 numbers issued to citizens of Romania and Bulgaria. Overall, the immigration statistics yesterday said that net immigration – the number by which immigration swelled the population after emigration has been taken into account – was 212,000 last year. This is double the 1990s levels that David Cameron is pledged to reach by the time of the election next year. Among the first to arrive when controls on migrants from the two impoverished countries lapsed  earlier this year was Romanian  Victor Spirescu. Landing at Luton Airport on New Year’s Day, he was greeted by Labour MP Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons home affairs committee. Mr Spirescu, 30, told reporters: ‘I don’t come to rob your country. I come to work and then go home.’ Days after arriving, he found work with a team of fellow Eastern Europeans washing cars at a supermarket in the Bedfordshire town of Biggleswade – but he  lasted only one day before disappearing. Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said: ‘While recent net migration levels remain stable, the figures show that it has fallen by a third since its peak in 2005 under the last government and that this Government’s reforms have cut net migration from outside the EU to levels not seen since the late 1990s. ‘We are focusing on cutting out the abuse of free movement between EU member states and addressing the factors that drive European immigration to Britain.’ But Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: ‘David Cameron has broken his solemn promise to the British people on one of the most important political issues. And he has done so because he refuses to take back control of our borders in respect of more than 400 million people from more than two dozen countries on continental Europe.’ Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: ‘David Cameron and Theresa May promised “no ifs, no buts” to get their net migration target down to the tens of thousands by the end of the Parliament, and the actual figure is over twice that.’","34,904 Romanians and 10,445 Bulgarians registered for National Insurance numbers in January, February and March .

"Fatima Mangre was married to Arjun Bakridi when she was just four, but when her husband came to collect her four years later her father realised it was wrong and refused . An eight year old girl has become the youngest person ever to be divorced in India after she was married off aged just four. Fatima Mangre was given away by her father Anil, from the Shravasti district of Uttar Pradesh state, in an arranged a marriage with 10-year-old Arjun Bakridi. However when the boy arrived four years later to take his new bride away, Anil said he wanted the girl to wait until she was 18 before leaving. He said: 'I finally realised that this practice of marrying off daughters so young was wrong and that she should have a childhood, and that it was my duty to provide that.' However Arjun's father Dipak was unhappy with the decision, and an argument broke out after which Anil filed for divorce. The state government of India's has called for an inquiry into the incident that happened last week at Nakhi village in the Shravasti district of India's northern state of Uttar Pradesh. It ordered the probe after the New Delhi-based National Commission for Women (NCW) member Nirmala Samant sent a letter, demanding details of the divorce and threatening action against the parents of the girl and the boy. She said: 'This is a scandal, we need more details before taking action. The girl's father must answer why he married her off at four years old and the boy's father must answer why he agreed to such a marriage and then went to demand the girl when she is barely eight years old. 'This is insensitive, controversial and objectionable,' she added. However Fatima's father has already written to NCW, saying he should be pardoned because he stopped his daughter from being taken away by her in-laws. The northern state of Uttar Pradesh has one of the highest rates of child marriage in India, especially in he Shravasti district where Fatima was from (file picture) 'I have already admitted my mistake. Social pressures are high in our village. But the marriage has been annulled. I have admitted it was wrong to marry her off so early,' he said in a handwritten note. He added: 'I now want to make things right. I want to give my daughter a good childhood. I will do everything to protect her.' Mr Bakridi has gone into hiding following the altercation. According to UNICEF, over 32.9 percent of the girls are married against the national average of 22.1 percent below the legally permissible age of 18 in the state. The Shravasti district accounts for the majority underage weddings in India where the female literacy is just 19 per cent.","Fatima Mangre was married to Arjun Bakridi when she was four .

"Actors Tom Cruise, John Travolta and Kelly Preston were in attendance yesterday as thousands of Scientologists gathered in Clearwater, Florida for the dedication of their new $145million 'cathedral'. The 377,000-square-foot Flag Building is the tallest building in downtown Clearwater, and has been in construction for nearly 15 years. The opening of the building will mark the first time Scientologists have a place to practice the 'Super Power' program, developed by the religion's founder L Ron Hubbard in the 1970s. While the city was told to expect 10,000 Scientologists this weekend, the crowd gathered outside the Flag Building yesterday was noticeably smaller. The Tampa Bay Times estimated that numbers could have been less than 6,000. In the front row: Tom Cruise and John Travolta side-by-side in the front row as the Church of Scientology's Flag Building in downtown Clearwater, Florida is opened. The building is rumored to have a floor where members can get 'super powers' Jumbo-tron: Church of Scientology leader David Miscavige's speech was broadcast to the large crowd on a large video screen . Applause: Confetti falls as the Church of Scientology leader David Miscavige dedicates the massive Flag Building in downtown Clearwater . The ceremony was for parishioners only but even born-and-bred Scientologists couldn't get into the exclusive dedication ceremony. Danielle Lumberg is a third-generation Scientologist who belongs to the church in Clearwater, but wasn't allowed past the thick security surrounding the new buidling. Instead, she stood outside the event and tried to get as good a look at the new building as possible. 'It sounds like Disney World in there,' she told the Tampa Bay Tribune. Exclusive: The ceremony was for parishioners only but even born-and-bred Scientologists couldn't get into the dedication . Headquarters: The $145m building reportedly will be the only place where a highly classified Super Power program, first advanced by church founder L. Ron Hubbard in the 1970s, will be conducted . But she didn't seem to hold any grudge against the church for not letting her into the event. 'Thank God it's finally done,' she said. 'There are so many more people joining the church we really needed more space so we could be more comfortable and do more things for the community, and the response today is absolutely breathtajing. We've been looking forward to this for a long, long time.' Brad Kugler is a second-generation Scientologist from nearby Palm Harbor and he too wasn't allowed into the ceremony. Mr Kugler climbed a palm tree just for a better vantage point into the ceremony. 'I've been watching this come out of the ground for the better part of 15 years. It's huge,' he told the Tampa Bay Times. After a quick eight-minute speech by Scientology's leader David Miscavige, confetti-rained down and the cathedral's doors were opened to the thousands gathered outside. But for non-church members excluded on the outside, the building's opening was not a celebration. Around four people were seen protesting the event in Guy Fawkes masks, while other locals weren't happy at the religion's takeover of the city. Long-awaited moment: A live image of Church of Scientology leader David Miscavige is projected on a screen for a crowd . Tight security: Many people weren't allowed into the event to watch the unveiling. But they didn't mind. Danielle Lumberg said: 'Thank God it's done, we need more space' Huge crowds: Thousands of Scientologists were there to see the opening of the building which has been under construction for 15 years . The Super Power course was developed by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard and  promises to boost a person's perceptions or senses through a series of mental and physical tasks.Scientologists believe that in addition to the five senses of hearing, sight, touch, taste and smell we have 57 additional abilities known as 'perceptics'.These include an ability to sense blood circulation, balance, compass direction, temperature, gravity as well as an 'awareness of importance, unimportance.' In his writings Hubbard described the course as: 'A superfantastic, but confidential series of rundowns that can be done on anyone whether Dianetic clear or not that puts the person into fantastic shape unleashing the super power of a thetan.'This is the means that puts Scientologists into a new realm of ability enabling them to create the new world. It puts world clearing within reach in the future.'It consists of 12 separate high-power rundowns which are brand-new and enter realms of the tech never before approached.'Hubbard had originally wanted to offer the course in 1978 but many of his staff who had been through the instructor training left the church on completion of the course.In a written statement, church spokesman Ben Shaw said: 'Super Power is a series of spiritual counseling processes designed to give a person back his own viewpoint, increase his perception, exercise his power of choice, and greatly enhance other spiritual abilities.' 'People don't want to come to downtown . Clearwater because that's all you see — big groups (of Scientologists) walking everywhere. Downtown Clearwater could be a really interesting, . vibrant place,' said Debbie Halvorsen, 62, of Largo. Mo . Iskander would disagree. The local restauranteur sees the center's . opening as a money-making opportunity. He opened his new restaurant Mixx . Bar and Bar and Grill yesterday as well and aims to bring in . Scientology parishioners. 'The . church will play a big part in bringing attractions, festivals and . nightlife to the downtown area, and we're just the first,' he said. 'The . Scientologists are always well dressed, they look nice, and they keep . our city a nice place. And they need to eat, too.' The group broke ground on the Mediterranean Revival-style  building in 1998, but stopped work after finishing the shell. For . three years, the group ceased construction on the project until the . city started imposing $250-a-day fines for code violations. Scientology . defectors have explained that the building's slow construction is due . to church leader's who have allegedly used the project as a fundraising cash cow. An analysis by the Tampa Bay Times discovered that the church had raised $145million for the building, much higher than the $100million it was estimated to cost. Former Scientologist couple Rocio and Luis Garcia of Irvine, California contributed more than $340,000 to the construction of the Super Power building, before ultimately suing the church in federal court for dragging out the project 'as a shill'. Church representatives have described the Garcia's suit as 'frivolous'. While the new building is part of a larger complex of buildings that serve as a spiritual retreat for Scientologists, there will be space on the ground floor for visitors to learn about the religion. The visitor center will have a 'grand lobby' with a three-story atrium and exhibits that explain the religion's belief system and practices. The second and third floors are home to offices and classrooms while the basement houses a huge kitchen and dining areas. Three hundred small rooms for 'auditing' can be found on the buildings upper floors. Auditing is the religions form of counseling and a session can cost $1,000. But the jewel in the crown of the Flag Building is on the fifth floor, where members can pariticapte in the Super Power program for the first time. The Super Power program was developed by the religion's found L Ron Hubbard and described as one of his greatest discoveries. 'Super Power is a series of spiritual counseling processes designed to give a person back his own viewpoint, increase his perception, exercise his power of choice, and greatly enhance other spiritual abilities,' church spokesman Ben Shaw said in a statement. Hubbard went further in his description of the program saying: 'Super Power is the answer to a sick, a dying and dead society...With it we literally revive the dead.' As part of that therapy, members will be spun on an anit-gravity simulator blindfolded to improve their 'perceptics' - Hubbard's 57 senses which include sight, smell, taste, blood circulation, and awareness of awareness. Another interesting feature of the building is the circular running track located on floor six. Scientologists use the track for 'Cause Resurgence Rundown'. Basically they run until they have a moment of enlightenment called 'cognition'. Allegations: Former members of the church claim leaders have used the building's lengthy construction process as a fundraising ploy . A giant tent with the phrase ''Golden Age of Tech'' on it was set up next to the new Flag Building for its dedication in downtown Clearwater . Photographers look over the crowd which is estimated to have been around 6,000 strong .

"President Barack Obama has welcomed the Ukrainian Prime Minister to the White House and issued a stern warning to Russia about any plans to continue their occupation of Crimea. Mr Obama said that if Russia continues an aggressive path in Ukraine, the United States and other countries will, in his words, be ‘forced to apply costs’ to Moscow. Obama referred to the Russian military presence in Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and said the greatest threat facing Ukraine is to its territorial integrity. Together on the issue: President Obama welcomed Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk to the White House on Wednesday amid the ongoing crisis in his country . Serious issue: President Obama has continued to speak out against the Russian occupation of Crimea which started as the Ukraine was in political turmoil following a crackdown on protestors and the exile of their former prime minister . Obama made his remarks after meeting with Ukraine's new prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, at the White House in a display of support for the fledgling government. Yatsenyuk said Ukraine will ‘never surrender’ in a fight over its territory. The Crimean regional government has scheduled a referendum Sunday on whether to separate from Ukraine and join the Russian federation. Obama said he will stand with Ukraine in ensuring that its territorial integrity is maintained. In addition to issuing warnings, Obama expressed hope Wednesday that a referendum on the future of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula can be halted, as he met with the new leader of the former Soviet republic. Sitting side by side in the Oval Office with Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, Obama said he hoped last-ditch diplomatic efforts might lead to a 'rethinking' of Sunday's Russian-backed referendum. Symbolic: The Ukrainian Prime Minister's visit shows how closely the turbulent government is aligning itself with the United Staets . Diplomatic talks: Yatsenyuk  also paid a visit to the State Department and spoke with Secretary of State John Kerry who traveled to Kiev earlier this month . If the vote does occur, Obama said, 'We will not recognize any referendum that goes forward.' Obama and Yatsenyuk met as the Senate began considering a package of both possible new sanctions on Russia and economic aid to Ukraine. The bill stops short of going after Russian banks or energy companies as some legislators proposed, but it would give Secretary of State John Kerry more leeway as he readies for diplomatic talks with his Russian counterpart in Europe on Friday. Yatsenyuk, a 39-year-old pro-Western official, took control in late February after Ukraine's pro-Russian president fled after three months of political protests. First handshake: Obama's meeting with Yatsenyuk amounted to a diplomatic dig against Russia, which does not recognize Ukraine's new government . Looking on: Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry were in the Oval Office for the historic meeting . With Ukraine now caught in a diplomatic battle between East and West, Yatsenyuk said Russia must recognize that his country can have ties with both. 'Ukraine is and will be part of the Western world,' Yatsenyuk said, speaking in fluent English. Obama's meeting with Yatsenyuk amounted to a diplomatic dig against Russia, which does not recognize Ukraine's new government. Russia has moved military forces into Crimea, a pro-Russian area that will vote Sunday on whether to become part of Russia or remain in Ukraine with broader powers. Obama urged Congress to quickly approve the $1billion loan guarantee to help Ukraine's fledgling government. That guarantee is supposed to supplement $15billion in assistance from the European Union, as well as additional money from the International Monetary Fund.","Ukrainian Prime Minister Arsenly Yatsenyuk has arrived in Washington .

"Criminal intent: Actress Brittany Murphy's death in 2009 was initially attributed to pneumonia but a new toxicology report says she may have been slipped rat poisoning or an insecticide . A new toxicology report says rat poisoning may have been the real cause behind the death of actress Brittany Murphy. The mother of the Clueless actress found her dead body on December 20, 2009 and the Los Angeles Coroner originally attributed the death to pneumonia and anemia. Murphy's husband, Simon Monjack, followed her in death five months later from the same causes. But according to an independent report ordered by her father, Angelo Bertolotti, Murphy did not die from natural causes, leading some to believe that she and her husband may have been poisoned by a third party. Mr Bertolotti finally secured the release of his daughter's hair, blood and tissue samples for testing after years of litigation and submitted them for independent testing. The Carlson Company found ten heavy metals in Brittany's system which were several times higher than World Health Organization high levels at the time of her death. 'If we were to eliminate the possibility of a simultaneous accidental heavy metals exposure to the sample donor then the only logical explanation would be an exposure to these metals (toxins) administered by a third party perpetrator with likely criminal intent,' the report says. Heavy metals are found in most rodenticides and insecticides meaning the actress could have been slipped rat poisoning or bug killer. At the time of her death, Brittany displayed all the symptoms of heavy metal poisoning including: headaches, dizziness, abdominal cramps, coughing, sweating, disorientation, wheezing, congestion and pneumonia. Scroll down for video . Fighting for the truth: The Clueless actress' father Angelo Bertolotti (above) ordered the new toxicology report, and resents the way his daughter's death has been covered in the media . Scene of the crime? Brittany Murphy died at her home in the Hollywood Hills on December 20, 2009. Her husband followed her in death five months later . Who did it? While Murphy's husband Simon Monjack's samples have not yet been independently tested, he exhibited the same symptoms as his wife before his death leading some to believe he too was poisoned . Murphy's husband also exhibited similar symptoms before his death, leading some to believe he too was poisoned. Mother-in-law Sharon discovered his body as well after moving in with him following her daughter's death. 'Vicious rumors, spread by tabloids, unfairly smeared Brittany's reputation,' Mr Bertolotti told the Examiner. 'My daughter was neither anorexic nor a drug junkie, as they repeatedly implied. Brittany and Simon were ridiculed by The Hollywood Reporter, when they complained of being under surveillance in fear for their lives. I will not rest until the truth about these tragic events is told. There will be justice for Brittany.' At the time of her death, early speculation was that the actress died of a drug overdose or anorexia after years of shocking weight loss. Prescription pills were found in the actress' system, but they were treating a cold and respiratory infection. Murphy was perhaps most famous for her role in 1995's Clueless, but she also had more serious roles in Girl, Interrupted and played Eminem's love interest in 8 Mile - the movie about the rapper's life. At the time of her death, Murphy's career had tapered off and her last major role was in 2004's Little Black Book. Before marrying Monjack, Murphy dated Ashton Kutcher, her co-star in the film Just Married. After breaking up with the actor, she went on to have two serious relationships that led to engagements with talent manager Jeff Kwantinetz and production assistant Joe Macaluso before marrying Monjack, a screenwriter, in May 2007.

"President Barack Obama has selected acting Secret Service Director Joe Clancy to stay on as head of the agency permanently. The White House repeatedly cited on Wednesday the 'credibility' of 27-year-veteran of the Secret Service as the reason he selected. Clancy was brought on by Obama last year after former Director Julia Pierson resigned amid fury over security breaches at the White House and elsewhere that put the president in danger. President Barack Obama has decided to appoint Joseph Clancy to be the new head of the Secret Service. Clancy, the acting director of the agency, must now be confirmed by the Senate before he can permanently take over . White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest noted Wednesday Clancy still has 'a lot of work' to do to restore the agency's reputation, but his 'solid performance' in the position so far cemented the president's belief that he was the man for the job. A Department of Homeland Security report following the string of embarrassing scandals involving the Secret Service last fall - including a situation last fall in which the president was allowed to ride in an elevator at a government building with an unvetted security agent carrying a gun - concluded that the agency would benefit from having an outsider at the helm. The Secret Service it said was too 'insular' and the agency was 'starving for leadership.' Clancy was in retirement when Obama begged him to come back on in an interim position to lead the ailing agency. He previously served in the president's detail. Earnest told reporters Wednesday that Clancy had proven that he was able to take a 'candid, clear-eyed' position on reform of the agency. Already, he asked to resign or transfer within DHS at least six longtime agents, including the No. 2 at the Secret Service, Alvin Smith, and four assistant directors. He has also ordered all officers who work at the White House to undergo additional training, Earnest revealed, following a 2014 incident in which a man armed with a knife made it over the fence and into the White House before he was stopped by an agent. Earnest said that Clancy's willingness 'to use his credibility' to make changes and his experience at the agency is 'in some ways is the best of both worlds' when it comes to turning around operations within the security agency. Clancy 'holds himself to a very high standard of professionalism,' Earnest said, and the White House believes 'his style of leadership will have a positive effect on the agency.' Clancy must be confirmed by the Senate before he can officially be named Secret Service Director. President Barack Obama (L) arrives at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport with U.S. Secret Service agents, including then Special Agent Joseph Clancy (C), in Cincinnati, Ohio, in this September 7, 2009 file photo. Clancy was on Obama's personal detail before he retired from the Secret Service, only to be dragged back in to fix the ailing agency by Obama last year . House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz said Wednesday it is 'disappointing the President ignored the recommendation' from the independent panel that reviewed Secret Service operations at the request of Homeland Secretary Jeh Johnson. 'The Panel made it crystal clear that only a director from outside the agency would meet the needs of the agency today – someone with a fresh perspective, free from allegiances and without ties to what has consistently been described as a ""good old boys network,"" ' Chaffetz said in a statement. He added, 'The good men and women of the Secret Service are screaming for a fresh start.' Chaffetz said the Secret Service 'would best be served by a transformative and dynamic leader from outside the agency.' Still, the Utah Republican said he appreciates the work Clancy has done in his short time at the agency to implement the recommendations of the blue ribbon panel and looks forward to working with him.","White House repeatedly cited  'credibility' of 27-year-veteran of the Secret Service as the reason he was selected .

"Sunbathing has been blamed for a massive surge in cancer rates over the past ten years. Cancers caused by unhealthy lifestyles, such as drinking and smoking, have seen a rise of up to two-thirds in the last decade, official figures show. Cases of malignant melanoma – the deadliest form of skin cancer, which affects many young people – rose more than any other type in the past decade. Sunbathing has been blamed for a massive surge in cancer rates over the past ten years . The surge is in part due to people’s ‘choice of clothing’ and failure to cover up in the sun, leaving them exposed to harmful UV rays, according to the Office for National Statistics. Lung cancer and other forms linked to smoking have also gone up, along with oral and kidney cancers, which can be triggered by alcohol. Overall, two out of five cases of cancer are blamed on poor lifestyle, with about a quarter of breast  cancers attributed to lifestyle and environmental factors. The ONS report shows the number of cases of malignant melanoma soared by 66 per cent between 2002 and 2011. Cases of malignant melanoma rose more than any other type in the past decade . In 2002 there were around 6,700 cases diagnosed in England, but by 2011 there were 11,100. Nearly 85,000 non-melanoma skin cancers – also driven by sun exposure – were diagnosed in England in 2011. ‘These increases are considered to be due to altered patterns of behaviour in recent decades, such as a choice of clothing and recreational sunbathing,’ says the ONS. Lung cancer and other forms linked to smoking have also gone up, along with oral and kidney cancers, which can be triggered by alcohol . There were 7,000 cases of kidney cancer – which is linked to drinking – in 2011, compared with 5,000 cases in 2002, and about 6,000 oral cancers. The report found that 27 per cent of cases of breast cancer in women are linked to lifestyle and environmental factors – such as alcohol consumption, obesity, lack of physical activity, and hormonal and reproductive factors. In 2011, 41,523 English women were diagnosed with the disease and it is the most common cancer in women accounting for 30 per cent of cases. Prostate cancer was the most common type in men, with 35,567 cases in 2011 accounting for a quarter. The rate of lung cancer in women is fast catching up with men as older women who started smoking since the 1970s develop the disease. The number of men diagnosed was 19,173 in 2011 – a fall of 11 per cent since 2002. In women, cases rose by 15 per cent over the period, to 15,675. ‘While men remain more likely to smoke than women, the gap has narrowed,’ said the ONS report. Women tended to be diagnosed with cancer at younger ages than men, with breast cancer responsible for 44 per cent of all cancers among women aged 25-59 years. In older age groups men were more likely to be diagnosed and overall, cancer was more prevalent among men than women. Nick Ormiston-Smith, of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘Every year, around 275,000 people are diagnosed with cancer in England. The biggest risk factor is simply getting older. ‘But 40 per cent of cancers can be attributed to lifestyle factors. Cutting down on alcohol, keeping a healthy weight, avoiding sunburn and being more active can help reduce the risk.’ Ciarán Devane, chief executive of  Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘It is startling that the number of new cases of cancer diagnosed has soared by nearly a fifth in the last ten years. ‘However it is important to note this overall figure disguises a wide variation across the cancer types. ‘The figures also reveal a worrying gender gap. Cancer affects women more in younger age groups, but men are significantly worse affected over the age of 60. The reasons for this are only partially understood.’","Cancers caused by drinking and smoking have risen by two-thirds .

"In South Korea alone it is estimated that 2.5 million dogs are eaten every year - and millions more are eaten around in the world, mostly in Asia. Residents of many countries, however, view dog-eating as immoral, while the practice is forbidden by Judaism and Islam.

But the dogs were better able to find the hidden food when the robot had a human face on it's monitor, and acted 'socially'. He cites figures from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) that say 1.2 million dogs are euthanised every year in the U.S. And he suggests eating them is not only an option, but it could also be helpful. According to Sutter, in a book titled ‘Eating Animals’ vegetarian novelist Jonathan Foer writes: ‘Unlike all farmed meat, which requires the creation and maintenance of animals, dogs are practically begging to be eaten. ‘The simple disposal of these euthanised dogs is an enormous ecological and economic problem.' The problem arises in the disposal of euthanised dogs - while some are cremated, others are left on landfills. According to the College of Veterinarians of British Columbia veterinarians use potent drugs to euthanise pets. But if not properly disposed and left on a landfill, 'scavenging wild or domestic animals can be poisoned by the drug remaining in the dead animal.' And Foer continues: ‘It would be demented to yank pets from homes. But eating those strays, those runaways, those not-quite-cute-enough-to-take and not-quite-well-behaved-enough-to-keep dogs would be killing a flock of birds with one stone and eating it, too.’ Sutter, however, does not condone the poor treatment of dogs intended to be food.

However Luke Duggleby, a photographer in Thailand who investigated the dog trade in Laos, Thailand and Vietnam, is divided on the issue. ‘Eating dog is a very touchy subject and one that can provokes incredibly angry responses,’ he tells MailOnline. ‘I personally wouldn't eat it and wouldn't support the idea of eating it but it is not my place to tell others what they can or can't do especially when they come from a totally different culture. ‘I think it is fine to outlaw it in countries like ours that has a very close relationship with dogs and strong animal rights. ‘But in a country whose culture it is and has been for a long time to eat it I don't think it is our place to tell them to stop. ‘Hindu's don't get angry when the rest of the world eats cows so whilst people eating dogs is upsetting to us we must accept that the practise happens and try and see it from their perspective. ‘Seeing the dogs being beaten in such a way was horrible and upsetting but it’s my job to suppress my emotions and simply concentrate on the telling of the issue.’ Sutter cites figures from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) that say 1.2 million dogs are euthanized every year in the U.S. He suggests eating them is not only an option, but it could also be helpful. Pictured is a caged dog rescued by animal lovers in China on its way to a restaurant in 2012 . Sutter does not condone the actions of the trade - which can include cramming dogs into cages among other abhorrent practices. But he does question why we should frown so heavily on eating animals we regard as pets or friends, whereas others like cows and pigs are so readily eaten. On Twitter, opinion has been divided on Sutter’s piece. ‘When is the last time a pig or cow saved a deaf kid from a burning [building]’ writes @robertsamu88. But @MattSchiavenza says: ‘Having spent a lot of years in China, this ‘eating dogs’ op-ed is eminently sensible. Recently in China activists took to the streets to protest against the country's Dog Meat Festival. Held in Yulin, Guangxi province the event sees dogs killed and eaten in celebration of the summer solstice. Animal rights activists say the event is a public health risk because the dogs undergo no quarantine to ensure they are free of disease, and that they are strays grabbed off streets around the country, as well as allegedly stolen from pet owners. The dogs are often poisoned with toxic chemicals that could be harmful to humans, they say.","Eating dogs is commonplace in Asian countries like Vietnam and Laos .

"The bread and butter of Twitter is getting more followers, but to get more followers you ultimately need to get more retweets. A new study has looked into the science behind what makes a tweet popular and therefore more likely to be shared, and has discovered it may be as simple as just adding a photo. Dan Zarrella, HubSpot's social-media scientist, discovered that tweets including photos, and in particular photos hosted by Twitter's own picture service, are 94 per cent more likely to be shared. The study looked at 400,000 tweets and compared their retweet rates. It discovered tweets including photos, and in particular photos hosted by Twitter's own picture service, are 94 per cent more likely to be shared, left. Tweets with Instagram photos attached had a negative effect and were 42 per cent less likely to be retweeted . At the other end of the scale, tweets that include links to Instagram pictures are 42 per cent less likely to be retweeted. Zarella studied 400,000 randomly selected tweets and compared their retweet rates. After discovering that photo tweets received more retweets on average than tweets only containing text, Zarella compared where each of these photos were hosted. Every time a photo is posted online, the original image is hosted on a particular service which then creates a clickable link. This makes it possible to share images without having to send the original files. Zarella looked at photos tweeted using Twitpic, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter's own picture service, pic.Twitter.

"A Kentucky artist is on a mission to paint 5,500 portraits of shelter dogs doomed to be put to sleep. That’s the number of dogs killed per day in U.S. shelters, a number that shocked Mark Barone enough to start doing something about it. By putting a face to the statistic, Barone hopes to spread awareness of the plight of homeless animals in the U.S. Inspired: Kentucky artist Mark Barone spends each day painting doomed shelter dogs as part of a project to create 5,500 canine portraits . It began after Barone’s own dog of 21 years, Santina, died three years ago. His partner Marina Dervan thought it would be a good idea to adopt a new dog. ‘Mark was not interested,’ Dervan told Fast Company. ‘He just wasn't ready…But that didn't stop me. I was going online and looking at dogs. But instead of finding a dog, I found out all of the statistics about what was going on in terms of the amount of animals who were being killed in our shelter system.’ Dervan said she began sending the alarming information along to Mark who, at first, didn’t want to look at it. ‘Two days later, he said, “I have a really clear vision of what I want to do to solve the problem.”’ A videos of how the project came about can be found on Barone and Dervan's website. Touching: Barone paints the dogs whose stories affect him most deeply on giant 8'X8' canvasses. Here, he paints a dog named Oreo . In memoriam: Barone was inspired to spread awareness of the plight of shelter dogs after his own dog Santina (left) died and he learned that 5,500 dogs are euthanized each day in the U.S. Halo: Barone and his partner Marina Dervan name each of the dogs, whose pictures are sent to them by shelters with only ID numbers. Halo, pictured, was deemed unadoptable because of her advanced age . AN ACT OF DOG from Sarah Haeberle on Vimeo. Barone decided to paint 5,500 portraits using photos posted to shelter websites. According to ABC News, various shelters send Barone photos of dogs that have been put to sleep, in order that they be memorialized. The goal is to create a massive memorial that will help spread the word about the problem of countless dog deaths in kill shelters across America. Rosco (pictured) wasn't adopted because he's deaf. 'There is a no-kill solution,' says Dervan . T-Bone: Devan and Barone are on a mission to help more animal shelter convert to no-kill shelters . Lucas: A large proportion of euthanized dogs are pit bulls and pit bull mixes . ‘There is a no-kill solution,’ Dervan said, ‘which more and more shelters are beginning to use. We are trying to raise awareness and spread education on the topic.’ Barone paints around 10 portraits per day and he’s two years and 3,500 portraits into the project. Each painting is 12’’X12’’,but the very special ones are as large as eight square feet. Diamond: Barone wants to put 5,500 faces to the issue of America's overcrowded animal shelters . Jim: 'We are trying to raise awareness and spread education on the topic,' say Dervan. Jim was described as a 'sad and withdrawn' dog . 'Breeze was killed because she was shy and frail,' says Dervan. She and Barone are out to 'heal a broken system' Pit bulls like Harry are sometimes killed within hours of entering the sysem according to Dervan. She hopes the project, An Act of Dog, will help stop such euthanization . Jackie: Dervan and Barone believe all 5,500 euthanizations that happen each day in the U.S. is preventable. Jackie had 'food bowl aggression,' but the artist doesn't believe she deserved to be put down . ‘The size of the project is half the size of the Sistine Chapel,’ Barone says. ‘The Sistine Chapel is 11,000 square feet, and this will be 5,500 square feet. If you stack the paintings 10 feet tall, it'll be two football fields long.’ Barone and Dervan have dubbed the project An Act of Dog and they hope to partner with a philanthropist or city to install the giant work as a permanent display to help raise funds toward turning more shelters into no-kill shelters. Sita (pictured) was another pit bull mix. They are some of the most common dogs in shelters . Barone works on his portraits everyday starting in the morning and sometimes continues well into the night. Pictured is Manny . Mission: Barone is now two years and 3,500 portraits into his projects he hope will get funded to become a museum memorial dedicated to ending kill shelters .","Mark Barone of Louisville, Kentucky hopes to spread awareness about the no-kill shelter alternative using the sad faces of euthanized dogs .

"From politicians to primary schools, unions and sports clubs – no one was exempt from being shamed by the 2014 Ernie Awards which call out the worst sexist comments and policies made in the last year. Christopher Pyne, Australia's education minister, took out two of the top awards for the night, both the Gold and the Political Silver Ernie, for his comment that university fee increases won't disproportionately affect women. 'Women are well-represented amongst the teaching and nursing students,' he said during an appearance on ABC's 7:30 Report. 'They will not be able to earn the high incomes that say dentists or lawyers will earn.' Scroll down for video . Education minister Christopher Pyne (left) and Senator Eric Abetz (right) went head to head in the category for the Political Silver Ernie, with Mr Pyne proving to be the worse offender . Senator Eric Abetz came a close second in the political category however, with his academically inspiring comment: 'I think the studies, and they date back from the 1950s, have said there is a link between abortion and breast cancer'. Both Mr Pyne and Mr Abetz's statements had attendees booing, whistling and thumping their fists at their dinner tables - the procedure by which votes are determined -  for almost 30 seconds after being read out, before a 'boo-off' soon declared Mr Pyne the winner. But who could forget Brian Woods, a member of the Palmer united party whose comment left women everywhere reminiscing about the good old 1950s. Kyle and Jackie O won an award for questioning Channel Nine sports journalist, Erin Molan, about how many sportsmen she had slept with and whether she has had breast implants . Wicked Campervans won the Industrial Silver Ernie for the sexist slogans painted on the back of their vans . Meredith Burgmann, the organiser of the event, read out Mr Woods' comment from the stand with revulsion: 'Domestic violence is solely a woman's choice when it comes to women being assaulted. I'm saying women have a choice to accept it or leave it... don't whinge to me. Dump them or have them removed by law order'. Tony Abbott was also nominated under the political category for three separate occasions, including his infamous wink while speaking to an elderly woman while on the radio who admitted she was forced to work on a sex-line to make ends meet. However, the Prime Minister was instead awarded the Repeat Offenders award, for the eighth year, at the end of the night. Amongst the least surprising winners of the night was Wicked Camper Vans, who were awarded the Industrial Silver Ernie for a number of slogans which appeared on the back of their vans including 'Life sucks if your girlfriend doesn't' and 'In every princess, there's a little s**t who wants to try it just once'. But it was Chevron, the oil and gas company, that left guests bewildered when it was announced that their job application form had asked applicants to supply details about their reproductive past including whether they had ever been pregnant, had a termination and whether their children had been born with any birth defects. Kyle Sandilands and Jacki O won the Celebrity/Clerical award for questioning a female sports journalist, Erin Molan, on-air about how many sportsmen she had slept with and whether she has had breast implants. Journalist Piers Akerman was a clear winner for the Media Silver Ernie, with seven nominations including one for referring to the former governor general as 'the current clothes horse Quentin Bryce'. But it was Mr Akerman's comments about cartoon Peppa Pig that scored him the take-home prize. 'Even the cartoon character Peppa Pig pushes a weird feminist line that would be closer to the hearts of Labor's Handbag Hit Squad than the pre-school audience it is aimed at,' he wrote when referring to the ABC's 'left wing agenda'. A More than 70 nominations were read out across eight categories on the night, with Tony Abbott being awarded the Repeat Offenders award . Meredith Burgmann, the event organiser, celebrated the 22nd year of the event alongside 330 attendees . The Daily Telegraph's Sydney Confidential section also raised an eyebrow or two and encouraged some foot stamping amongst attendees, for their editorial regarding model Lara Bingle. 'Her reps have denied she is pregnant, her breasts however fail to pertain to the rumours. Shots of her looking increasingly baxen in the surf suggest that if she wasn't pregnant, she'd at least had a recent boob job,' the Ernies organiser and founder Meredith Burgmann read out at the podium. The traditional celebration which has entered its 22nd year saw the coming together of over 300 women and men from all ages and backgrounds in New South Wales Parliament House on the night, when more than 70 nominations were read out.","The Ernie Awards call out the most sexist comments and policies made by people and businesses across Australia over the last year .

"Time is running out for women who want to conceive at 35 or older as age is one of the major causes of infertility, warns a Queensland's IVF expert. This follows a new study which revealed a concerning number of Australian women who lacked awareness about their fertility. It showed that many women wrongly believed that IVF was a 'safety net' but in fact need to start trying early if they want to start a family, Queensland Fertility Group medical director David Molloy said. Women should start conceiving before they hit their mid-30s and shouldn't rely on IVF, says a Queensland IVF expert . The survey of 1000 women, released today by IVFAustralia, Melbourne IVF and Queensland Fertility Group, found a shocking 64 per cent of respondents didn't know their fertility would decline rapidly from 36 onwards. It also showed 60 per cent of women thought that infertility in their 40s can be resolved through IVF. However this is a complete misconception. Dr Molloy said IVF doesn't guarantee pregnancy as success rates rapidly decline for aging women. Women who want children need to plan ahead and try to have their first child early, says Dr David Molly . 'Your highest chance of success having a child will be if you can conceive before the age of 35. One of the most common reasons we see patients is age-related infertility, they are basically a modern woman – educated and a valuable addition to the workforce, but what has suffered is their fertility,' Dr Molloy told The Courier Mail. 'If you put a 34-year-old through an IVF program, the chance of getting pregnant on a single treatment cycle is in excess of 40 per cent.' 'When we put a 40-year-old through an IVF program, the pregnancy rate is about 20 per cent.' Karyn Reardon, now mother of two, was 29 when she and husband Gerard first tried to start having children. 'It took me eight challenging years to produce my first baby – if I had waited until after 35, perhaps it would never have happened,' she said. After several rounds of IVF she gave birth to her first child Flyn, 8, at 37 years of age and Ostyn, 4, at 40. She echoed the views of Dr Molloy and urged women start early if they want to start a family.

"Wealthy Middle Eastern clients were supplied with prostitutes during the Cannes Film Festival, a French court has heard. The women formed part of a high-class prostitution network and escorts, models and beauty queens were all hired to entertain men at luxury hotels, grand villas and yachts in France. Seven men and a woman went on trial in the southern port city of Marseille, though the five chief figures are on the run and are being tried in absentia.

"It is one of the most recognisable pictures ever taken and an image that not only defined a war, but defined the career of the man who took it. Kim Phuc was just nine years old when she ran naked towards Associated Press photographer and Pulitzer prize winner Huynh Cong 'Nick' Ut screaming 'Too hot! Too hot!' as she headed away from her bombed Vietnamese village. She will always be remembered for the blobs of sticky napalm that melted through her clothes and left her with layers of skin like jellied lava. Her story has been told many times over the last 40 years since the shot was taken. But now, to mark four decades since Ut took the picture he has released more moving images that he took during the Vietnam war that chart the horrors of that fateful day in 1972. Huynh Cong 'Nick' Ut took this picture just moments before capturing his iconic image. It shows bombs with a mixture of napalm and white phosphorus jelly and reveals that he moved closer to the village following the blasts . Vietnamese Marines rush to the point where a descending U.S. Army helicopter will pick them up after a sweep east of the Cambodian town of Prey-Veng in June 1970 . Trees are ravaged in the background to this picture of a South Vietnamese tank crew as the soldiers inside abandon it after being hit by B40 rockets and automatic weapons two miles north of Svay Rieng in eastern Cambodia . When compared with the first image it becomes apparent that Ut actually started heading towards the village following the napalm attack. The sign to the right of the picture appears larger while what looks like a speaker to the left of the road is no longer in shot. As he headed towards the town and took the photo, which Kim Phuc has now found peace with after first wanting to escape the image, he would have been unaware the effect his picture would have on the outside world. It communicated the horrors of the Vietnam War in a way words could never describe, helping to end one of the most divisive wars in American history. He drove Phuc to a small hospital. There, he was told the child was too far gone to help. But he flashed his American press badge, demanded that doctors treat the girl and left assured that she would not be forgotten. 'I cried when I saw her running,' said Ut, whose older brother was killed on assignment with the AP in the southern Mekong Delta. 'If I don't help her - if something happened and she died - I think I'd kill myself after that.' Spending so much time with members of the military he also got time to picture them having fun. Here he pictured youthful civil defence militiamen leap into the flooded Nipa Palm grove near Saigon on April 6, 1969 . Never far from devastation, Nick Ut took this picture of journalists photographing a body in the Saigon area in early 1968 during the Tet offensive . A line of South Vietnamese marines moves across a shallow branch of the Mekong River during an operation near Neak Luong Cambodia, on August 20, 1970 . Not all his images are full of death and destruction. This one taken on September 20 1970 shows a Cambodian soldier smiling at the camera while on operations in Vietnam . Back at the office in what was then . U.S.-backed Saigon, he developed his film. When the image of the naked . little girl emerged, everyone feared it would be rejected because of the . news agency's strict policy against nudity. But veteran Vietnam photo . editor Horst Faas took one look and knew it was a shot made to break the . rules. He argued the photo's news value far outweighed any other . concerns, and he won. A couple of days after the image . shocked the world, another journalist found out the little girl had . somehow survived the attack. Christopher Wain, a correspondent for ITN . who had given Phuc water from his canteen and drizzled it down her . burning back at the scene, fought to have her transferred to the . American-run Barsky unit. It was the only facility in Saigon equipped to . deal with her severe injuries. Not all Ut's images were of death and . destruction, however, and one taken two years earlier shows a Cambodian . soldier smiling at the camera while on operations in Vietnam. Another shows a group of youthful . civil defence militiamen leaping into the flooded Nipa Palm grove near . Saigon on April 6, 1969. Ut became a photographer when he was . just 16 shortly after his brother, Huynh Thanh My was killed. He joined . Associated Press under the tutelage of renowned combat photographer, Horst Faas, who died last month. This picture Kim Phuc running away from her bombed village when she was just nine is now instantly recognisable and seen as a defining image of the Vietnam war . Brought together by the iconic picture, Ut has met regularly with Kim Phuc since the image was taken 40 years after he insisted she be taken to a U.S. hospital . The pair were reunited yesterday at Buena Park, California, as part of celebrations to mark four decades since that fateful meeting . Soon after newspapers in the U.S. published is iconic photograph, president Richard Nixon spoke with . frustration to his chief of staff Harry Haldeman calling it into . question and suggesting it could have been 'fixed'. Ut wrote when wires of that . conversation were released 30 years later: 'Even though it has become . one of the most memorable images of the twentieth century, President . Nixon once doubted the authenticity of my photograph when he saw it in . the papers on June 12, 1972.... 'The picture for me and . unquestionably for many others could not have been more real.

"Britain has just five scanners to detect stowaways trying to enter the country in lorries through our 29 ports, it can be revealed. There is mounting concern about security at our borders with 2,500 illegal immigrants camped in Calais trying to reach the UK. The UK Border Force budget fell by 20 per cent last year, raising fears about the ability to detect attempts by foreigners to smuggle themselves across the Channel in cars, trucks and trailers. Scroll down for video . Illegal migrants are seen running behind a lorry to try to board it as it passes through Calais in the hope of reaching Britain undetected . The Home Office has admitted that it has only five Passive Millimetre Wave Imaging devices which scan vehicles for the presence of ‘clandestines’ before they reach the UK's 29 ports . Ministers have been forced to admit that despite there being 51 points of entry into the UK at 29 ports for foreign vehicles, there are just five scanners in operation in France checking vehicles before they leave for Britain. The so-called Passive Millimetre Wave Imaging devices scan vehicles for the presence of ‘clandestines’. Each scanner costs around £800,000 to buy, and £83 to run for 24 hours. With so few devices available, there are concerns that they are not used in some areas because they risk causing queues of lorries to build up, making it easier for stowaways to climb into the backs of lorries. The figures were unearthed by Tory MP Steven Barclay in a series of parliamentary questions. He told MailOnline that it raised serious questions about the security of the UK’s borders. He said: ‘It is very concerning that the UK Border Force budget has been cut and there are so few machines to scan vehicles at a time when we know our points of entry, particularly at Calais, are under such pressure. ‘When Parliament is being asked to vote on the European Arrest Warrant we need to demonstrate that everything possible is being done at our borders to prevent illegal entry into the country. ‘The significant increase in illegal entrants identified over the last year illustrates the urgency in resourcing border controls effectively.’ He highlighted figures show that the Border Force budget was cut by 20 per cent from £596million in 2012-13 to £467million last year. The Home Office confirmed that the five Passive Millimetre Imaging devices are ‘located at the juxtaposed controls’ in France and are used for ‘detecting clandestines in soft sided vehicles’. There are a further 19 body-scanners which individuals must walk through, which are used to detect drugs. The Home Office said that last year the Border Force detected and prevented 18,000 attempts to enter the UK illegally before they left the continent, a 62 per cent rise on the previous year. Tory MP Steven Barclay said more needed to be done our borders to prevent illegal entry into the country . Growing numbers of migrants have been trying to enter the UK through Calais in recent months. Last week Bernard Cazeneuve, the French interior minister, called for Britain send police to Calais to deal with the port's 'tremendous problem' with illegal immigration. Calais' mayor Natacha Bouchart told MPs that Britain was seen as an ‘El Dorado’ for migrants – and many were prepared to die to make the journey. Blaming the UK for the crisis, Miss Bouchart said lavish benefits and the prospect of illegal work and accommodation were magnets for immigrants determined to get across the English Channel. She said illegal migrants, many fleeing humanitarian disasters in Africa and the Middle East, were ‘prepared to die’ to reach Britain, believing it to be like the mythical lost city of gold, El Dorado. British taxpayers will be contributing to a new £2.35 million a year welcome centre for UK-bound illegal migrants in Calais. The bill will be added to the £12million the British government has already pledged to the French to improve security in the port town this year. Hauliers face stiff penalties of thousands of pounds if they are caught with illegal immigrants hiding in their lorries. If they are carrying food or crops in their lorries, the cargo is often condemned, leaving them further out of pocket. The Road Haulage Association has urged the Home Office to do more to increase truck speeds through ports ‘in order to reduce boarding times, and limit the opportunities for illegals to board vehicles’. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Security at the UK border is our priority and Border Force employs a number of cutting-edge techniques to detect clandestines. ‘These include the use of body scanners, imaging devices, sniffer dogs, carbon dioxide detectors, heartbeat monitors and scanners - in addition to officers conducting visual searches. “Last year, our officials detected and prevented 18,000 clandestines entering the UK illegally and we will continue to strengthen our border to stop those who have no right to enter the UK.” Calais' mayor  Natacha Bouchart has warned migrants are willing to risk death to cross the English Channel and access Britain's benefits system . Tomorrow MPs will vote on Britain being part of the European Arrest Warrant, which makes it easier for criminals to be deported between EU countries to face justice. The controversial power is one of 35 European Union police and criminal justice measures the  Government wants to opt back in to, with MPs expected to vote on the package as a whole. The Tory leadership faces a revolt from dozens of Tory MPs,who could defy the party leadership to oppose the measure because of concerns that it is too easy for UK citizens to be extradited on relatively minor charges to countries where they may have no guarantee of a fair trial. Home Secretary Theresa May today issued a direct plea for MPs to back the EAW. 'If we want to stop foreign criminals from coming to Britain, deal with European fighters coming back from Syria, stop British criminals evading justice abroad, prevent foreign criminals evading justice by hiding here, and get foreign criminals out of our prisons, these measures are vital. 'Tomorrow evening, the House of Commons should vote to give the police, prosecutors and other law enforcement agencies the powers they need to keep us safe.' Home Secretary Theresa May issued a direct plea for MPs to back the European Arrest Warrant, which makes it easier to deport criminals across EU borders . Tory backbencher David Davis accused Mrs May of 'scaremongering' with her claims the (EAW) would lead to Britain becoming a 'honeypot' for fugitives. Writing in the Sunday Times Mr Davis said: 'It is better to take a few weeks longer to return a terrorist to British justice than to take three years longer to recover a British citizen from a foreign injustice. 'The warnings that Britain will become a safe haven for criminals is an example of the sort of scaremongering that has become far too prevalent in the debates on justice and anti-terrorism measures. 'The UK was certainly no safe haven prior to the introduction of the EAW.'","EXCLUSIVE: Home Office has 5 Passive Millimetre Wave Imaging devices .

"Nine people who own the brand-new iPhone 6 Plus have already contacted Apple, upset about their warped devices, the tech giant said Thursday. Apple Inc went into damage control mode, addressing what has come to be known as 'BendGate' by claiming that costumers' complaints about iPhones warping are few and far between. The statement from the tech giant came just hours after Apple pulled back a flawed software update. 'With normal use, a bend in iPhone is extremely rare and . through our first six days of sale, a total of nine customers . have contacted Apple with a bent iPhone 6 Plus,' Apple . spokeswoman Trudy Muller said in an email. Scroll down for videos . Flexible: Apple Inc responded to its critics saying that only nine customers have complained about iPhone 6 Plus bending . 'Much ado about nothing': The tech giant stated that with normal day-to-day use, a bend in iPhone 6 Plus is extremely rare . Apple shares closed down nearly 4 per cent at $97.87 Thursday, wiping out nearly $23billion in market value. The new devices have faced criticism and widespread ridicule over their apparent bendability. Social media and online forums are overflowing with comments and memes poking fun at the phones' ability to bend when placed in back . pockets or while wearing skinny jeans. Apple said its new batch of iPhones feature stainless steel and titanium . inserts to reinforce high-stress locations and use the strongest . glass in the smartphone industry. The only way an iPhone may have bent is if someone put it in . their back pocket and sat on the phone for a very long time, . said Laban Roomes, chief executive of Goldgenie, which . customizes and gold-plates iPhones. Apple was also forced to withdraw a glitch-ridden update to its . latest operating system after some users of its new phones . complained of call service disruptions. 'We apologize for the great inconvenience experienced by . users,' Muller said. Apple said on its website it was working on an iOS update to . fix the issue, and will release it in the next few days. 'I do believe this speaks to execution issues at Apple,"" said JMP Securities analyst Alex Gauna. 'At the end of the day I . believe this too shall pass, but we are noting with concern that . the miscues pile up.' Apple said on Monday it had shipped 10million units of . iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Users of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus also complained about the . inability to use the fingerprint-reading Touch ID after updating . to iOS 8.0.1. 'Unbreakable': iPhones feature stainless steel and titanium inserts to reinforce high-stress points and use the strongest glass in the industry . Some users had complained of 'sluggish Wi-Fi and dwindling . battery life' after moving to iOS 8, Time magazine reported . earlier this week. Earlier today, Apple issued a step-by-step guide for users to . reinstall iOS 8, launched last week, through the latest version . of iTunes. The health app will not work for now and will be . fixed in the next software update, the company said. Customers might, however, hope for replacements for their . bent iPhones, depending on whether their devices passed an . inspection, tech news website The Next Web reported, quoting an . Apple support executive. Cases of bent iPhones 5 and 5s had been reported in 2013 by . Cult of Mac, a website that exclusively covers Apple. Rival smartphone manufacturers wasted no time taking digs at Apple's woes. A Samsung Electronics Co Ltd ad featured a bending phone against its own product, while . BlackBerry Ltd CEO John Chen said: 'I would challenge . you guys to bend our Passport.' Bend it like Dali: 'BendGate' has gone viral on social media, with Apple's critics poking fun at the new phones' apparent flexibility . The reason for the bend is due to the iPhone 6 Plus being made out of aluminium. Aluminium is a relatively soft metal and is fairly ductile and flexible so, if enough pressure is applied, it will bend and move. According to iMore, no part of either of the new iPhones has more than a quarter of an inch (0.64cm) of aluminium in any spot. This means that, in areas of the phones that are weakest, it’s possible it could be susceptible to bending. This is noticeable in images, with many of the bends occurring near the volume buttons and the SIM card slot. These areas have segments of the shell cut out to make room for the buttons and SIM card, so there is less aluminium - and they are more likely to bend. To stop the phone bending, users need to ensure that they do not put increased pressure on the middle of the phone. For example, do not have it sideways in a pocket, as your pocket will push it against your leg, possibly causing bending. Putting it in your back pocket could also have a similar effect, so storing it in a shirt pocket or bag might be a better option. Another option would be to make sure you have a case for the phone so that it can maintain its rigidity even when pressure is applied.","An Apple spokesperson revealed that only nine customers have complained about a bent iPhone 6 Plus .

"Two long-lost brothers have been reunited for the first time in an incredible 80 years after they were fostered to different families as babies. Ron Boyes, 83, was sent to Heage in Derbyshire when he was three, while his brother, Fred, 80, was taken in by a family in Banbury, Oxfordshire, when he was a baby. But despite living 87 miles apart, they led remarkably similar lives. One big family again: Long-lost brothers Fred, centre left, and Ron Boyes, centre right, are surrounded by their family having been reunited for the first time in an incredible 80 years . Both enlisting with the RAF at 18, . reaching the same rank of leading aircraftman, playing on the right wing . for their football teams, both marrying, and both naming a daughter . Wendy. The pair, who are now pensioners and RAF veterans, were reunited in Belper, Derbyshire, after a relative did research into their family tree. The brothers were both speechless when they came face to face and simply gave each other a huge hug. Fred said: 'It was a very emotional meeting. When we finally got talking, it sparked other things off and then we talked all day.' The siblings left their home in Exeter in 1933, although no one knows exactly why they were fostered. Back together: Fred Boyes, left, and Ron Boyes, were fostered by two different families 80 years ago but were reunited after a relative started researching their family tree . Fred was initially taken in by the Salvation Army and it is thought Ron went to St Bartholomew's Hospital in London. His . family have seen a cutting from The News of The World at the time, . appealing for foster parents to take in children, and one of the . youngsters pictured was Ron. They were brought up under their foster parents' names and were unaware of their true identities. The men first discovered they had been fostered when they joined the air force. Ron was at the time known by the name of Gotheridge and Fred by Geecock. But they needed their birth certificates to enrol and realised they had been born to Rose Boyes in Exeter. Fred said: 'We have no idea why our mother gave us up.' After leaving the RAF, Ron moved to Belper and in the late 1960s decided to find out more about his birth family, by visiting the address in Exeter. Wendy Miles, Ron's daughter, said: 'They explained what information they had and they were asked in. 'He met Rose but to begin with she kept denying that she had had him. Eventually she said yes but only after she learned where they lived.' Catching up: Fred, left, and Ron Boyes, have plenty to talk about after meeting each other for the first time in 80 years . Ron was employed in the textile trade, working at the Stevenson Dye Works while Fred settled in Oxfordshire and set up his own contract cleaning company. Both men married, Fred to Gene and Ron to Margaret, and had children. Both are now great-grandfathers. Wendy said that the urge to find his birth family never left Ron and he often spoke of it. As his health began to deteriorate, he moved in with her. Fred had been contacted by a foster family member who had been researching the family history. Fred said: 'This chap, called Albert, had been doing some family history research and had spoken to my foster family in 1986. But they had never told him that I was adopted. 'Somehow he got that information and gave me the number for what turned out to be Wendy's ex-husband. I gave them a call and once I got through to Wendy we arranged to meet.' Wendy said: 'We had told my dad Ron that it might be too late to find his family. So when we got the call from Fred it was amazing.' The brothers eventually met this month with members of their extended families. Fred said: 'This isn't the end. We're still looking for another brother who believe was also fostered and we think there was a brother who also died in the war.'","Ron Boyes, 83, grew up 87 miles from where Fred, 80, spent his childhood .

"It's not often you hear of fears of a zombie invasion - and if you do, it's almost certainly on television. But in the event of an apocalypse brought about by an army of the undead, civil servants would co-ordinate the military's efforts to 'return England to its pre-attack glory'. The country's contingency plans for a zombie onslaught emerged in a response to an enquiry from a member of the public. In the event of an apocalypse brought about by an army of the undead, the Pentagon has a plan in order to 'preserve the sanctity of human life' among all the 'non-zombie humans' A Freedom of Information request has shown the surprising level of readiness for the eventuality. The Ministry of Defence would not lead efforts to plan for such a horror attack or deal with the aftermath, reported by the Daily Telegraph, because that role would rest with the Cabinet Office, which co-ordinates emergency planning for the Government. The MoD replied to the FoI request: 'In the event of an apocalyptic incident (e.g. zombies), any plans to rebuild and return England to its pre-attack glory would be led by the Cabinet Office, and thus any pre-planning activity would also take place there. 'The Ministry of Defence's role in any such event would be to provide military support to the civil authorities, not take the lead. 'Consequently the Ministry of Defence holds no information on this matter.' It is not unusual for the Army to be called upon to save the day in zombie films. In 2004 comedy Shaun of the Dead, soldiers arrive just in time to save the film's hero. Earlier this year, troops in the US were trained using a mock zombie invasion. Hundreds of military, law enforcement and medical personnel observed the Hollywood-style production of a zombie attack as part of their emergency response training. In the scenario, dubbed 'Zombie Apocalypse', a VIP was trapped in a village, surrounded by zombies when a bomb exploded. The VIP was wounded and his team had to move through the town while dodging bullets and shooting at the invading zombies. An attack of the zombies in the 2004 film 'Shaun Of The Dead'. In the film the Army comes to the rescue . At one point, some of the team are hit by zombies and have to be taken to a field medical facility for decontamination and treatment. Last year, an official from Bristol city council replied to a question asking what it would do in the event of a zombie rampage with a copy of a 'top secret' internal strategy document setting out its response. Peter Holt, service director of communication and marketing, wrote: 'In response to your request for details of Bristol city council's contingency plans for dealing with zombies, I can now release to you the following strategy document. 'Please note that this document contains various redactions as it has been considered that some information contained therein must be redacted for the purpose of safeguarding national security.' Marked top secret, the document set out four alert states, from ambient zombie level where business would proceed as usual to the highest level - zombie pandemic level - where infection levels would be over 30 per cent. To avoid 'widespread panic', staff would be asked to listen for codewords on radio and television broadcasts to warn them that a zombie attack is under way. Under 'health and safety' guidelines, the document urged staff to remember the correct zombie-killing procedure: 'Fully disconnect the brain-stem from the body through either blunt force or full head removal.'","Contingency plans emerge in response to enquiry from member of public .

"The Pacific airline which became the first in the world to charge people according to their weight is to introduce an 'XL class' this week for its heavyweight passengers. Samoa Air is modifying some of the seating in its fleet of propeller aircraft to cater for people who weigh more than 20 stone. Like many Pacific islands, Samoa has heavier people as a result of genetics or the large amounts of root vegetables they consume. More room up top: The airline will fit special seats in a row dedicated to the larger passenger . The country regularly appears among obesity statistics, with more than 80 per cent of the population over the age of 15 regarded as overweight. Now all the airline's Britten Norman and Cessna aircraft are being fitted out with a special XL row that has been extended by up to 14 inches to provide more leg - and stomach - room, with more space between the seats. Samoa Air chief executive Chris Langton told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that the airline had also added a special ramp on its planes to allow for easier access for large passengers. 'Once you're up and around that sort of weight, a traditional seat on any airline is going to be uncomfortable,' said Mr Langton. Anything to declare? The people of Samoa are typically larger due to their diet of root vegetables . 'Quite often the access is difficult and even the space between the seats is enough that even when you've squeezed into the seats there's no room for your legs. 'We don't have a large fleet of aeroplanes, but we wanted to do something that recognised that we are thinking about this.' Mr Langton said the XL size was available with clothing and it was no different when catering for larger aircraft passengers. 'The airline industry is going to have to do that - we're going to have to provide a range of seats categorised in terms of weight and maybe some other indexes like height. 'So when people travel they can give us those indicators and we can allocate them to an appropriate seat.' Samoa Air introduced a 'pay by weight' booking system earlier this year, requiring passengers to type in their weight on the airline's online reservation system, where their individual fares were calculated. On the airline's shortest domestic route, rates range from 60p for 2.2lb to £2.50 per pound for travel from Samoa to neighbouring American Samoa. Mr Langton said the rate includes a passenger's body weight and baggage. A passenger weighing 10 stone, for example, will be able to purchase a domestic ticket for about £40. The airline began flying within Samoa last year and it has now expanded to connect with neighbouring islands.","Airline will give heavier passengers 14 inches more space .

And they add: 'Officially certified as offering class VR6 ballistic protection, it is the first vehicle specifically designed to protect against the world’s most widely used firearm, the AK-47, while at the same time offering drivers the everyday flexibility they need.' The car is fitted with special steel and shatterproof glass and comes with an eight-cylinder, turbocharged engine generating 450 horsepower, which means drivers can power their vehicle away if they feel they are in danger. Other safety features customers can chose from include run-flat tyres, a self-sealing fuel tank, an attack alarm and an intercom system. BMW claim it is the first manufacturer to offer protection from an AK-47 attack in its security vehicles . But despite the safety features, BMW also add that it drives like any other sports utility vehicle offered by the company. However, with normal X5 series vehicles starting from £43,000, an X5 Security Plus is likely to cost around £110,000. The model joins BMW's previous security car, the BMW 7 Series High Security, which is designed for high-ranking officials and corporate executives.

"Car manufacturers are always looking for ways to make driving safer . And in the future, dashboard emotion detectors could search for signs of irritation in a bid to identify the first signs of road rage. A prototype of the device is able to read a driver’s facial expressions using a tiny embedded camera. Scroll down for video . Scientists at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland, developed the prototype device, which identifies a driver's emotions - including anger (pictured) - using an infrared camera placed behind the steering wheel to film their face . Scientists at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland, have developed the system which identifies which of the seven universal emotions a person is feeling: fear, anger, joy, sadness, disgust, surprise, or suspicion. They believe their technology could be of use in medicine, marketing, gaming and in driver safety. ‘We know that in addition to fatigue, the emotional state of the driver is a risk factor, the researchers said. ‘Irritation, in particular, can make drivers more aggressive and less attentive,’ they added. The scientists worked with PSA Peugeot Citroën to create the prototype, which had to overcome the challenge of measuring emotions in the confines of a small space without distracting the driver. Researchers at EPFL's Signal Processing 5 Laboratory came upon the idea of adapting a facial detection device for use in a car by using an infrared camera placed behind the steering wheel. Here, the device shows a driver with a 'neutral' expression . Researchers at EPFL’s Signal Processing 5 Laboratory came upon the idea of adapting a facial detection device for use in a car by using an infrared camera placed behind the steering wheel. ‘The problem was to get the device to recognise irritation on the face of a driver,’ they said, because everyone expresses this emotional state differently. Research leaders Hua Gao and Anil Yüce chose to track only two expressions: anger and disgust, whose manifestations are similar to those of anger. Irritation makes drivers more aggressive and less attentive (stock image) and while the researchers wanted to track this emotion, it was difficult to develop a system that could do this, which could also fit into a small space without distracting the driver . The system first learned to identify the two emotions using a series of photos of subjects making corresponding facial expressions and then the same exercise was carried out using videos. Using this system of learning, the device could accurately detect irritation in most cases and when it failed it was because of an individual’s way of displaying anger. The scientists will aim to create a system that can work in real-time with a more advanced facial monitoring algorithm. The team is also working on a fatigue detector that measures the percentage of eyelid closure, which could one day be used to develop a safety system to stop people falling asleep at the wheel. They are also striving to detect distraction and on using lip reading and voice recognition, to give more of a clue to a driver’s mental state.

Volvo has launched a revolutionary safety device that scans for cyclists and automatically brakes if a collision is imminent. The Swedish car firm says the camera and radar-guided technology, which is being introduced into cars from May, could save hundreds of lives. The system comprises a radar scanner in the grille, a camera fitted in front of the rear-view mirror, and an onboard computer. It allows the car to identify cyclists who swerve into its path and reacts by slamming on the brakes. The driver is given a loud audible warning and a visible warning of a row of red lights flashing up on the windscreen. The new cyclist detector system comprises a radar scanner set into the car’s grille, a camera fitted in front of the rear-view mirror, and a computerised central control unit. The radar measures the distance to any suspicious object while the camera compares its shape and size against an electronic visual catalogue of thousands of images – including bicycles and cyclists. It can even differentiate between a pedal cyclist and a motor cyclist.

"Aruba sounded familiar. Could this be anything to do with the Beach Boys' jingly song Kokomo, where the island's name is sung in the chorus. You know how it goes: 'Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take ya...' As it was, we would be hearing this tune many times on this fascinating Caribbean island. Aruba is a Dutch protectorate. Once part of a group of three islands that fell under Dutch rule (Curacao and Bonaire are the others), it has been independent since 1986. From the moment you touch down at Queen Beatrix Airport, you sense there something special is going on. Home for the week: Enjoying the sunset at the Bucuti & Tara beach resort in Aruba . Yes, it has white-sand beaches and clear, blue waters packed to the brim with every fish you could hope to see and of course the bars ooze rum punch. But there's also the grandeur of the architecture in the capital, Oranjestad. The Bucuti & Tara Beach Resort is a low-lying hotel on the quiet Eagle Beach, on the western coast. It is adults only. Our room was simple, though luxurious, all dark-wood furniture and linens. It overlooked a pretty garden, the lawns stretching out to the beach half a minute's walk away. The capital city of Oranjestad is home to many grand Dutch-style buildings in a myriad of beautiful colours . On our first day, we headed inland to explore some rock formations thought to have healing powers. My wife Rose swore she felt a tingle, touching the rocks. Then we adjourned for lunch with local fishermen at the Zee Rover, a cafe perched above the landing stage for their boats. We decided next day that we would take a snorkelling tour boat to get a close look at a wreck. Tickled pink: Flamingos are easy to spot on Renaissance Island in Aruba . It was something neither Rose nor I had ever done before and we set off in a packed boat for the site, which was about a third of a mile from the shore. We spied some elegant flamingos on the way. The wreck loomed out of the gloom 20 ft below us and suddenly we were confronted by thousands of colourful fish flitting here and there. 'They were so close. I felt like a fish,' said Rose. One day we decided to make a late-afternoon visit to Oranjestad's historical museum. Beautifully laid out in the cool of one of the town's oldest buildings, and packed full of everything from the antiquities made by the island's native people to clever, interactive installations. Beach life: Most holidaymakers park themselves on the fabulous white sand beaches . Our guide, a young history buff, told us gripping tales about the traders, pirates, invaders and other colourful characters. He, and the whole island, is especially proud of one inhabitant, Boy Ecury, who fought with the Dutch in World War II, one of the few black soldiers. He died a hero, executed by the Nazis. This connection to European history was brought home to us later, touring a nearby park, where there is a lovely statue of Anne Frank. Colonial colour: Oranjestad blends Latino and Dutch influences with a myriad of colourful buildings . Colourful iguanas stroll protectively around her feet, and we thought how right it was to see her in such a beautiful place, under the Aruban sun.

"People are taking fewer holidays, according to a survey by travel organisation Abta. The number of people taking a break fell from 83 per cent in 2013 to 80 per cent this year, the poll of 2,008 adults showed. There has also been a decrease in the average number of holidays taken per person, from 3.1 trips in 2013 to 3.0 in 2014, although holidays abroad remain stable at 1.2 per person. The number of Britons having a holiday fell from 83 per cent in 2013 to 80 per cent this year, with only 53 per cent taking at least one holiday abroad . Those in north east England, east England and Scotland took the fewest foreign holidays per person in 2014 with Londoners and those in north west England taking the most. This year Londoners took, on average, 3.9 breaks in the UK or abroad, up from 3.3 in 2013. Londoners also took the most foreign holidays per person, with 11 per cent of them taking four or more foreign holidays in the past 12 months. This compared with just two per cent of those in east England and three per cent of those in the East Midlands taking four or more foreign holidays. The Welsh took the greatest number of domestic holidays, at 2.2 per person. The poll showed that 68 per cent of people took at least one UK holiday in 2014, while 53 per cent had at least one trip overseas.

The number of people booking an overseas package holiday rose from 46 per cent last year to 51 per cent this year, with 41 per cent people taking a holiday both abroad and in the UK in 2014, compared with 39 per cent in 2013. There was also an increase in holidays abroad of 1-3 nights, suggesting overseas city breaks were popular . There was also an increase in holidays abroad of 1-3 nights, with Abta suggesting that the overseas city break had performed well during the year, perhaps helped by a strong pound making short overseas breaks more affordable. The survey showed that 35 per cent think they will take a holiday to a new country over the next 12 months, with 48 per cent saying they were quite likely or practically certain to visit a new resort or city. Younger holidaymakers appeared the most adventurous with 49 per cent of 16-24-year-olds saying it was quite likely and a further 16 per cent saying it was certain they will go to a new destination. But 56 per cent of over 65s and 51 per cent of 55-64-year-olds said that they would definitely not or would be unlikely to visit a new country. Abta chief executive Mark Tanzer said: 'It is clear that despite continuing pressure on the majority of household budgets, people are still keen to preserve their main annual holiday. 'While the market was very buoyant at the start of the year with consumer confidence on the up, the late-holiday market was tougher, perhaps reflecting the broader dip in consumer confidence in July, as well as good weather in the UK in June and July which we know impacts holiday sales. The research shows there are reasons to be optimistic for next year.'","Londoners took most holidays with average of 3.9 trips in UK and abroad .

"A hysterical 911 call made by George Zimmerman's girlfriend today has been made public, where she claims that he pointed a shotgun at her face. Samantha Scheibe called for help at 12.30pm on Monday outside of her home in Apopka, Florida, claiming that Zimmerman had locked her outside and was smashing up furniture. At one point during the call, Miss Scheibe screamed at Zimmerman: 'You put your gun in my freakin' face... Get out of my house. Do not push me out of my house. Please get out of my house.' Scroll down for 911 call . Latest mugshot: George Zimmerman has been arrested again over a new domestic violence claim after his girlfriend reportedly called police following a confrontation at her home that involved a gun . Scheibe said that Zimmerman had smashed a glass table, threatened her with the shotgun and ultimately pushed her out of the house, according to an arrest report. After pushing her out, Zimmerman barricaded the door with furniture and refused to leave, saying that he would talk to police by phone, authorities said. Scheibe told the dispatcher: 'You kidding me? He pushed me out of my house and locked me out. ... He knows how to do this. He knows how to play this game.' Moments later, Zimmerman called 911 from inside the barricaded house to tell his side of the story. 'I have a girlfriend, who for lack of a better word, has gone crazy on me,' Zimmerman said. Zimmerman then said he never pulled a gun on his girlfriend, and that it was Scheibe who smashed a table at the home they shared. He also told the dispatcher that Scheibe was pregnant with their child and that she had decided she would raise the child on her own. When Zimmerman started to leave, 'she got mad,' he said. Seminole County Sheriff's Office Deputy Chief Dennis Lemma said at a news conference that Scheibe wasn't pregnant. Deputies used a key provided by Scheibe to unlock the door and they were able to push through the barricade of items, Lemma said. 'She was very concerned for her own safety especially having the weapon pointed at her and then being pushed out,' he said. Lemma says Zimmerman was compliant and unarmed when deputies came to the house. Zimmerman was arrested following the domestic disturbance call. He . now faces one felony charge of aggravated assault with a weapon and two . misdemeanors after pushing his girlfriend outside of her house and . destroying a piece of furniture in the backyard. He is due to appear before a judge at 1.30pm (EST) on Tuesday. Companion: . Samantha Scheibe is the striking blonde Shellie refers to as . Zimmerman’s ‘latest babe’ according to one close friend of Zimmerman's . estranged wife . Zimmerman was picked up by police in Apopka at the intersection of Topfield Court and Bonnie Drive shortly after 1pm on Monday. The . girlfriend in question has been identified by officials as Samantha . Scheibe and she lives at the residence where Zimmerman was arrested. The Orlando Sentinel reported that an associate of the Zimmerman family have confirmed that he has been living with Ms Scheibe for several weeks. At a Monday evening press conference, Seminole County Sheriff Don Eslinger confirmed that Ms Scheibe was the one to call police. 'She and George Zimmerman were having a verbal dispute and at that time she indicated that he broke a table and pointed a long-barreled shotgun at her,' Sheriff Eslinger said. 'She was obviously very concerned. 'She was on the phone with our dispatch, communicating as much information as she could.' Zimmerman pushed her out of the home and then barricaded the front door so that she could not re-enter, using furniture to block the doorway. Ms Scheibe had her cell phone with her and called police. Officers were able to arrive at the scene less than four minutes later and made verbal contact with her outside of the house. She then gave them a key to the home and they went in the building to speak with Zimmerman. When they found him, he was unarmed and 'offered no resistance to deputies as they responded', the sheriff said. 'Visibly . shaken': Samantha was with Zimmerman when he had a showdown over their . divorce in September. Shellie can be heard on the 911 call screaming . 'there's a woman in there!' He added that Ms Scheibe was being . cooperative with authorities and was still speaking with detectives when . the press conference was held at 5pm. 'We're going to do everything that we can do to protect her,' he added. The . specifics of the altercation remain unclear, but the sheriff's comments . suggested that at some point during the fight Zimmerman threatened her . with a shotgun and then barricaded her outside of the home. The Seminole County sheriff's office released the following information about the location of George Zimmerman as he awaits his bail bond hearing tomorrow: . He has been placed in this status (segregated from the general population) due to the high profile nature of the case. Zimmerman’s cell is designed to hold two inmates and is approximately 67 square feet. It is equipped with a toilet and a bed. A mattress, pillow, bed sheets, and blanket are provided. It remains unclear what exactly prompted the fight, but according to the police report it escalated quickly. '(Ms Scheibe) advised that she and George Zimmerman just had a verbal altercation that resulted in him breaking a glass table in the living room, retrieving a shotgun, and pointing it at her,' the sheriff's office said in the official press statement. 'She was able to get to the front of the house andcall 911. As she approached the door, he ultimately pushed her out and locked the door behind her. He then barricaded the door with several pieces of small furniture. 'She was not injured and no one else was at the home.' Sheriff Eslinger confirmed that there were two weapons found in the home. WKMG reported that Zimmerman is not eligible for bail. A . local news reporter from WFTV cites an unidentified source who says . that the Monday afternoon incident involved Zimmerman, his girlfriend . and a gun. New look: Zimmerman has clearly lost some weight between today (at right) and his murder trial (seen at left on June 14), not to mention his growing beard . Zimmerman's . former lawyer Mark O'Mara, who defended him in the high-profile murder . trial, announced that he will no longer be representing Zimmerman and . has no involvement in today's arrest. It is clear from the latest mugshot . that he has lost some of the more than 100 pounds he gained during the . time leading up to the Trayvon Martin murder trial this summer. He . is also seen with a full beard, showing that he has grown out his . facial hair more than ever previously seen in his earlier mugshots. 'Just when you thought you heard the last of George Zimmerman,' said neighbor Catherine Cantrell. She said she had twice seen a man who looked like Zimmerman get out of a truck that's been in the driveway for nearly a month. The truck parked there Monday appeared to be the same one that reporters have seen Zimmerman drive previously. 'I'm in absolute shock. He was never outside. It's not like he was out flaunting around,' she said. Cantrell said the woman who lived in the home was very sweet and quiet. Sarah . Tyler, 26, also lives across the street from the tan stucco house on a . cul-de-sac street of single family homes in Apopka, about 15 miles . northwest of Orlando. Scene: Zimmerman was arrested at his girlfriend's home on Monday afternoon, and his relatives told a local paper that he had been living at that residence for a few weeks . 'It's kind of frightening,' she said, adding that she only saw a woman came out of the house.

"Landlords are calling time at the bar as developers transform pubs from smelly-carpeted watering holes into multi-million pound apartments. The British pub has been in decline for decades with almost 20,000 shutting over the past 30 years. More than 3,200 of these have shut in London alone and now builders are buying historic, well-positioned buildings to convert into super-pricey homes. Scroll down for video . Then and now: The Red Lion pub in Mayfair used to be run down and boarded up, left, but it was then transformed into a luxury mansion and sold for £25million .

In W1, around exclusive Mayfair, Marylebone and Soho, 36 pubs have closed to be converted into new homes or mixed use. Southwark and Waterloo have seen 27 pubs converted while 13 have had their use changed in Chelsea. The Red Lion, in Mayfair, was recently sold as a £25million mansion while one property developer just paid £27million for The Black Lion in Bayswater. At £32million, the 2008 sale of the City Pride pub in Canary Wharf is the most expensive pub ever sold in London. With a housing shortage and pub profits nosediving, landlords and breweries are taking advantage of the value of the buildings and cashing in by selling them to developers. Space age: The designer kitchen inside what used to be the Red Lion pub features high-end appliances and endless bench space and opens out to the dining room . Luxury lounging: The pub was turned into an open plan mansion with enough room for the whole family to relax; large floor-to-ceiling windows flood the room with light . Top of the world: The new owner of The Red Lion can enjoy their own private beer garden, without having to endure noisy crowds . One developer, Thackeray Estates, has teamed up with Nicola Fontanella, who was Madonna’s interior designer to work on one pub. They are converting historic Dover House, a former hotel and restaurant in Waterloo, into nine luxury residential apartments. The £16million ultra-prime project will provide nine luxury apartments priced from £1million. Black Lion pub in Bayswater occupied prime real estate and it easy to see why developers saw potential in renovating it . The pub has just sold to a developer for £27million and is one of 3,200 London pubs to close in the last 30 years as pub profits plummet .

Home office: The Fulham development has been development with the successful executive in mind and boasts space for the owner to easily work from home . Trendy change: Property agents say social change, taxes, the smoking ban and cheap supermarket liquor are behind pub closures like the Redcliffe Arms . He said: 'Over the last 15 years there has been a huge wave in public houses across the capital being closing and being turned into new homes or mixed use resi-led schemes. 'This is because of social change, taxes, the 2007 smoking ban, cheap supermarket alcohol and the impact of the global recession. 'Redundant public houses across inner London have provided a very significant amount of stock for conversion into new homes or mixed use schemes. 'We recently marketed the former Red Lion Pub in Mayfair which closed in 2009 during the recession and has been converted into a five bedroom mansion priced at £25 million.

"The Alaska marijuana club owner and news anchor-turned-activist who quit her job on-air Sunday with a vulgar flourish has released a video detailing her reasoning behind the bold move. In 'Why I quit' former Anchorage reporter Charlene Ebge AKA Charlo Greene lashes out at marijuana 'prohibitionists' who seek to restrict access to the drug. Timed to come out just as news of her high-profile stunt began to make headlines Monday, the YouTube video is part of Greene's campaign toward legalization of marijuana in Alaska and, she says, eventually all across America. Speaking out: The Alaska marijuana club owner and news anchor-turned-activist who quit her job on-air Sunday with a vulgar flourish has released a video detailing her reasoning behind the bold move in a YouTube video . 'Why differentiate my toke from your beer,' she asks in the over 3 minute explanation of why she confessed her ownership of the Alaska Cannabis Club live on air before making the announcement that has now made her famous. 'And as for this job, well, not that I have a choice but, f*** it, I quit,' she said at the conclusion of her story about Alaska's upcoming marijuana ballot measure that would regulate marijuana. Greene is moving on to dedicate herself full time to making sure that measure passes and along with the video has posted an Indiegogo fundraising page to help her in the cause. 'As a member of the media, I've seen the dirty campaign tricks and lies that prohibitionists have been using over the past several months to sway Alaskan voters firsthand,' Greene laments. She's asking for $5,000, which she intends to put toward re-educating voters on the dangers, or lack thereof, of marijuana use. 'We smokers are responsible, contributing members to society,' as she said in her video. Her plea, thanks in no small part to her career-ending stunt, appears to be helping her cause. No even a day into her fundraiser, Greene raised over $3,700--74 percent of her goal and still 15 days to go. Reporter Charlo Greene made the confession live on air before announcing that she was quitting . Ms Greene had reported on the Alaska Cannabis Club during Sunday night's broadcast, without revealing her connection to it, Alaska Dispatch News reported. But at the end of the report, during a live shot, she announced that she was the club's owner and would be devoting herself to legalizing the drug in Alaska. She said: 'Now everything you heard is why I, the actual owner of the Alaska Cannabis Club, will be dedicating all of my energy for fighting for freedom and fairness which begins with legalizing marijuana here in Alaska.' Ms Greene then announced she was quitting and marched off camera. Back in the main studio, the anchor looked rather flummoxed as she struggled to decide how to proceed, before glancing up and down, offering an quick apology, and saying: 'We'll be right back.' The news channel took to Twitter to apologise. 'Viewers, we sincerely apologize for the inappropriate language used by a KTVA reporter on the air tonight,' it wrote. 'The employee has been terminated.' The Alaska Cannabis Club connects medical marijuana cardholders with other cardholders who are growing cannabis. On its website, the club bills itself as striking 'a perfect balancing act with Alaska's Medical Marijuana laws'. Growers are offered 'donations' as reimbursement for the costs of growing the plant, the club said in an interview with Alaska Dispatch News in August. The club said it hopes to increase access to medical marijuana patients, despite operating in a legal grey area within Alaska's murky medical marijuana laws. Fan: On an image on her Facebook page, Greene can be seen giving marijuana plants the thumbs up . The club had encouraged its Facebook followers to watch the broadcast and video clips were quickly uploaded to YouTube last night. Marijuana legalization opposition group 'Big Marijuana. Big Mistake. Vote No on 2' posted on its Twitter page: '#KTVA reporter covering ballot measure 2 loses her mind, confesses to being an owner of the cannabis club and quits while on the air.' On November 4, Alaska voters will decide on whether to legalize recreational use of marijuana in the state in a move similar to that which has already occurred in Colorado and Washington. No holding back: While on a trip to Colorado, she poses with a joint and marijuana in another Facebook image .","Charlene Ebge AKA Charlo Greene posted a video Monday that details why she walked off during a segment, saying 'f*** it!

Kremlin strongman was asked by a pensioner whether after his annexation . of Crimea, he had colonial ambitions for  the American territory which . was sold to Washington in 1867 for a bargain $7.2 million. 'Faina Ivanovna, dear, why do you need Alaska?' Putin responded to the pensioner.

'Let's not get ahead of ourselves.' Alaska was settled as a fur trading outpost in the 18th century by tsarist Russia. Some Russians have disputed the legality of the Alaskan sale. The .

During the phone-in the Russian President also joked that he couldn't understand Mr Snowden's accent, saying: 'The American version of English is a little different from the kind of English I'm used to.' Mr Snowden had asked whether Russia indiscriminately analyses the information of millions of individuals. He added: 'Recently in the U.S. two individual White House investigations as well as a federal court all concluded that these programmes are ineffective in stopping terrorism and they unreasonably intrude on the private lives on ordinary citizens.

"The five-star hotel owned Andy Murray has failed a food hygiene inspection. Chez Roux, the restaurant at the luxury £1.8m Cromlix Hotel, was inspected in July by the Food Standards Agency at Stirling Council and issued with an ‘improvement required’ rating. The FSA said the classification means that the restaurant, which is run by renowned chef Albert Roux, ‘has not achieved an acceptable level of compliance with requirements of food hygiene law’. The Wimbledon champion bought the property, three miles from his home town of Dunblane, in February 2013 . The Cromlix House hotel was named Scotland's Hotel of the Year just 27 days after it opened in April . Bosses at the hotel, near Kinbuck, Perthshire, have insisted the there was only a minor issue caused by a faulty sink, which has now been fixed. The hotel said they have since applied for a second inspection by the FSA in order to have the FSA's review amended. Graeme Green, the hotel's general manager, said: ‘The first inspection identified a minor fault with the connection of the hand-wash sink. 'We repaired this immediately and have been informed a pass certificate is being processed.' They added that the hotel's restaurant has not been closed during the FSA's investigation. Judges described Cromlix House as a 'national treasure' at the Scottish Hotel Awards earlier this year . An FSA spokesman said: ‘The scheme effectively opens the door to the kitchen and/or food areas and consumers can see how well food businesses in their area have performed at their last food hygiene inspection. 'This will increase consumer confidence and help people make informed choices about where they eat.’ Albert Roux, who also owns La Gavroche in London - the first British restaurant to win three Michelin stars - oversees the restaurant which is also run by award-winning head chef Darin Campbell. The Wimbledon champion bought the property, three miles from his home town of Dunblane, in February last year. The Victorian mansion was extensively refurbished and reopened on April and includes its own private chapel and loch. The £1.8m Victorian mansion was extensively refurbished and reopened to the public earlier this year . Just weeks after it opened its doors to guests the hotel was named Scottish hotel of the year. Cromlix took the top prize at the Scottish Hotel Awards during a ceremony in Edinburgh with judges calling it a 'national treasure'. Awards chairman Gary McLean-Quin said at the time: 'This superbly balanced combination of solid investment, vision and hugely experienced management has made Cromlix the unanimous choice of judges this year. 'Hotels often have sizeable sums of money spent on them but that's only half the battle. Guests can expect to pay up to £595 a night for a room at the Cromlix House hotel during its peak season . 'What impressed us - and specifically enabled this award - was the involvement of award-winning management and individuals in every department - people of excellence we have known for a decade. The result is no less than a national treasure.’ The accommodation at Cromlix features 10 bedrooms and five suites, each of which is named after a great Scot, including Robert the Bruce, William Wallace, Robert Burns and even fellow sporting legends Sir Alex Ferguson and Sir Chris Hoy. The hotel overlooks 34-acres of secluded woodland, manicured grounds and tennis courts. Guests can expect to pay up to £595 a night for a room at the hotel during its peak season. The hotel is being managed for the British number one by Inverlochy Castle Management International and is already fully booked for the Ryder Cup, which is being staged a short drive away at Gleneagles next week. Several of the suites feature hand-painted freestanding gold, silver and copper baths and the rooms’ 32in televisions screens are disguised as mirrors.","£1.8m Cromlix Hotel, was inspected in July by the Food Standards Agency .

"Dream role: Dakota Johnson plays Anastasia Steele . There is no spanking to speak of, barely any bare, the merest whisper of a thrashing and only a snip of whip. Perhaps we should expect no more and no less from the highly anticipated trailer to 50 Shades Of Grey, released across the world yesterday. With the full film adaptation of the EL James novel not due for release until Valentine’s Day next year, this was the first tantalising glimpse of Dakota Johnson as the heroine Anastasia Steele and Jamie Dornan as saturnine Christian Grey, sado-masochistic master and all round good guy. And what of it? Well so far, so tepid. So very well mannered, my dears. Yes, Christian appears to get his top off without delay and wanders inexplicably through several scenes like a scaffolder on a hot day, keen to show off his abs to any passing babes. The main thrust, if I may say, of the clip focuses on one of the most innocent, earliest scenes in the mummy porn novel, where gauche Anastasia in a terrible blouse and a tumbledown ponytail attempts to interview millionaire bigshot Mr Grey in his chrome and steel power office. ‘I just have a coupla questions. Do you have any interests out of work?’ she chirps, as he prowls around the room with a roll of masking tape poking out of his breast pocket while thwacking a riding crop into the palm of his hand. Well, not quite, but we all know where this is going. Mr Grey tells Miss Steele that he doesn’t want to talk about himself, he is much more interested in her. He fixes his penetrating gaze upon her, much in the manner of a golden eagle sizing up a tasty vole. Before you know it, Anastasia is up in his helicopter and sitting on his glider – and I must report that these are real scenes, not euphemisms. They have a bit of a snog in a lift and Beyoncé growls over the soundtrack as if she had a touch of flu and her big toe stuck in a door. The clip ends with Anastasia chained up at last in Christian’s Red Room of Pain, the sado-masochistic lair where carefully choreographed punishments and humiliations are to be carried out upon her person on a regular basis. Well, they are in the book at least. In the trailer we last see her chained to the bed, a silk blindfold around her eyes and a smile playing on her lips. A smile that says… what? That she got the role that every young actress in Hollywood wanted? That everyone will have to wait until next year to see what happens next? Steamy: Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey and Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele in 50 Shades of Grey . Raunchy: The trailer features glimpses of kinky love scenes between the couple . The merest whisper of a thrashing: So far, so tepid. So very well mannered, says Jan Moir . Whatever happens, surely this Hollywood adaptation cannot be as bad as the books; a trilogy of clumsily written teen-style, steamy fiction which Salman Rushdie said made Twilight look like War And Peace. Worryingly, the film has had a troubled inception, with a number of actors, directors, writers and key personnel all being changed at short notice. British screenwriter Patrick Marber was drafted in to beef up the script, while Sam Taylor-Johnson was the chief director. After all, as Christian and Anastasia know, someone has always got to crack the whip.","Fans of the multi-million selling 50 Shades Of Grey books were given a first glimpse of the film adaptation with the release of the official trailer yesterday. Within a few hours the montage of scenes, based on the erotic novel about a pair of lovers who engage in bondage under contract, was trending on social media and had amassed hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube. Here Jan Moir gives her verdict."
"A gold bracelet Queen Victoria had inscribed with a poignant message from her late husband which was then gifted to one of her daughters has been discovered. The gold, diamond, pearl and enamel band was bought by Victoria and Prince Albert for a wedding present to Princess Alice. Albert tragically died six months before the big day which went ahead, although Alice was instructed to wear black mourning dress immediately before and after her marriage to Prince Louis of Hesse. The gold, diamond, pearl, and enamel band features a portrait of the princess next to a picture of a ship . The inscription reads: 'To dear Alice from her loving parents Albert and Victoria R who though visibly parted are ever united, April 25 1862' Victoria inscribed the bracelet with with a message from both of them. The message reads: 'To dear Alice from her loving parents Albert and Victoria R who though visibly parted are ever united, April 25 1862.' Victoria presented the memento to the princess three months before the ceremony and four months after Albert's untimely death. It is thought it was the last significant item the couple had commissioned for any of their children. Queen Victoria gave the gold bracelet to her daughter Princess Alice as a gift for her wedding to Louis of Hesse . The bracelet features a portrait of the princess on the front next to a picture of a ship to signify her leaving the family home and moving to Germany with her new husband. Princess Alice died in 1878 and the bracelet is thought to have been passed on to her second eldest daughter, Empress Alexandra Feodo Rovna. Queen Victoria's daughters Princess Victoria (left) and Princess Alice (right) pictured in 1850. Alice married in1862 . It is thought the band left the family after the empress was executed with her husband Tsar Nicholas II during the Russian Revolution in 1918. It was acquired by Professor Leonard Shaw, a millionaire engineer and antiques collector, who kept it at his home on Guernsey. An auctioneer visited the property after he died aged 98 in November 2010 and discovered the rare piece of royal memorabilia amongst the vast collection. The item is to be sold with a pre-sale estimate of £10,000. James Bridges, director at Martel Maides Auctions in Guernsey, said: 'The bracelet was found as part of Professor Shaw's collection after he passed away. 'He had a huge collection of jewellery and pocket watches, he was a real philanthropist, but we don't know how he came to acquire the bracelet. 'He bought a lot at auction in the 1960s through to the 1980s but it could have been from a private seller. I would be surprised if it was ever on the market before now. 'Princess Alice was engaged in 1861 and Queen Victoria and Prince Albert commissioned the bracelet to be made before she moved to Germany with her husband. Queen Victoria pictured with members of her family. Her husband Prince Albert died in 1861 at the age of 42 . 'The message on the back can be read in two ways; to signify her leaving the family behind or because Prince Albert was apart from his wife and daughter after his death. 'Princess Alice died when she was 35 and had seven children but two of them were murdered in Russia. It could have been here that the bracelet left the family. 'Queen Victoria liked giving jewellery as gifts to people such as nannies and godparents, but it is unusual to have something she gave one of her children for sale. It is incredibly rare.' Princess Alice's wedding at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight was described as 'most sombre of Royal weddings' following her father's death.

"With their ears pricked up and tails wagging, these excited hounds are raring to go as they bound through the autumn countryside as part of their exercise regime ahead of the new hunting season. With the season traditionally starting on November 1, huntsman Andrew German, of the Cheshire Forest Hunt, made sure the dogs were prepped and ready as they raced through fields and over beds of orange autumn leaves . Although a ban on fox hunting has been in force since February 2005 many supporters of fox hunting are continuing to call for a repeal of the ban, saying the current law is hard to interpret and enforce. Boundless energy: Huntsman Andrew German of The Cheshire Forest Hunt exercises his hounds in the autumnal countryside in preparation for the start of the new hunting season .

Changing times: Although a ban on hunting has been in force since February 2005 many supporters of fox hunting are continuing to call for a repeal of the ban, saying the current law is hard to interpret and enforce . The Hunting Act of 2004 bans the hunting of wild mammals, notably foxes, deer and hares, with dogs in England and Wales, although dogs are allowed to follow an artificial scent. A trail of scent is set out in such as way to mirror the movements of hunting live quarry, although with no live prey the progress of the hunt is less predictable and of a slower pace than that of a drag hunt. A combination of oil and either animal meat or urine is used, with the scent being dragged across the land for 10 or so miles. Raring to go: These hounds eagerly await the opening of this gate so they can get out for some exercise . Outlawed: The Hunting Act of 2004 bans the hunting of wild mammals, notably foxes, deer and hares, with dogs in England and Wales, although dogs are allowed to follow an artificial scent .

Playtime: The dogs play fight with one another and push their noses through the gates of their kennels in Knutsford, Cheshire as they prepare for their walk . Hunting in its current form can be traced back to the 16th century. Proponents of fox hunting view it as an important part of rural culture and useful for reasons of conservation and pest control, while opponents argue that it is cruel and unnecessary. Under the Hunting Act a person also commits an offence if he knowingly permits land which belongs to him to be entered or used in the course of hunting wild mammals, or allows a dog belonging to him to be used for hunting. Anyone found guilty under the Hunting Act is liable on summary conviction to a fine. The pursuit of foxes with hounds was banned in Scotland in 2002, although it remains legal in Northern Ireland.

"It was in a radio interview in November when Spain coach Vicente del Bosque, tired of managers pushing their players under his nose saying he should ‘call up this one’ or ‘take a look at that one’, said: ‘Why does no-one ever ask me about Adrian the West Ham goalkeeper?’ A slightly surprised silence among studio presenters gave way to a consensus that amounted to: good question, why does no one ever talk about Adrian? Two months later and more people are talking about the West Ham goalkeeper than ever before. Jose Mourinho, not prone to agreeing with Del Bosque, said after Adrian’s performance against his team on Boxing Day: ‘He was marvellous, just as he was marvellous last season’. West Ham goalkeeper Adrian could be in for an unexpected call up to the Spain squad this year . Sportsmail's Pete Jenson (right) caught up with the goalkeeper at West Ham's training ground . Spain stays glued to the Premier League during La Liga’s winter break and Adrian’s performances only enhanced his chances of becoming No 3 behind Iker Casillas and David de Gea when the next squad is announced in March. ‘I heard what Del Bosque said and it’s honour,’ he says at West Ham’s training ground. ‘It’s not just that he spoke about me but that he was the one who brought my name up. No-one asked him.’ Another famous Spain No 3, Pepe Reina, is one of the major reasons why a 28-year-old from Seville is now plying his trade in east London. ‘I know Pepe very well and I spoke with him before I signed for West Ham,’ Adrian says. ‘He told me: “Do it, don’t hesitate. The Premier League is a great opportunity and you’ll enjoy it hugely just as I enjoyed those years at Liverpool”.’ He doesn’t regret taking the advice. ‘It wins you over more with every game. There is never a match when it seems one of the two teams believe they can’t win. There are times in Spain when you have a team playing one of the big sides and because they have so much respect for them the attitude is “let’s defend and not lose by too many”. Here everyone goes for it. Everyone is brave.’ Spain manager Vicente del Bosque has talked up Adrian's chances of getting an international opportunity . Adrian admitted he was delighted to hear the encouraging words of the Spain boss earlier this season . Manchester United's David de Gea's position as Spain No 1 looks solid for years to come . Not that switching from Spain to the Premier League was easy. As with De Gea, there were adjustments for Adrian to make. ‘The play is a lot more physical here, there are a lot more high balls into the area and the refereeing is different,’ he says. ‘In Spain the slightest push on the keeper, especially if he goes down, the referee will blow. You have to watch the flight of the ball and dodge the challenges. ‘That’s the biggest difference but I have adapted well. I was good in the air in Spain and I’m big enough to cope so that has helped.’ There were other adjustments to make. Spanish goalkeepers are more prone to punch than catch and tend to be more comfortable using their feet. You can’t imagine Sam Allardyce favours a punching playmaker between the posts. ‘It’s true that here they don’t like you to punch,’ Adrian says, ‘but sometimes when the area is crowded and you try to catch you can get a nudge from someone, the ball gets away, and if they don’t blow for a foul it’s a goal. Sometimes a good punch will clear the ball very effectively so you have to mix it up. With passing the ball out from the back you can’t be taking unnecessary risks, but if you are decisive then there shouldn’t be a problem.’ Adrian was a late starter, not taking up the gloves until he was 11 and not breaking into the Real Betis first team until 25. ‘I was an outfield player before I was a goalkeeper,’ he says. ‘I played up front until I was 10 and I loved to score goals but when my Under 11 team CD Altair lost their goalkeeper and the coach asked: “Who wants to go in goal?” ‘I said I didn’t mind while we looked for a new keeper — 18 years on I’m still in goal!’ The former Real Betis man pulls off a remarkable save against Premier League champions Manchester City . Since making his Premier League debut, no goalkeeper has made more saves than West Ham's Adrian . Adrian was called 'marvellous' by Jose Mourinho after his recent performance at Stamford Bridge . He stayed at Betis for 16 years but had to wait for Pepe Mel’s arrival to graduate to first choice in 2012. ‘An obstacle always seemed to crop up. Three years ago I tore my cruciate and the following year I started as third keeper but the first keeper wasn’t playing well and the second keeper had problems after saying something in an interview that the manager didn’t like so my chance came and I took it.’ He’s bright too, picking up the language despite starting from zero. ‘You have to launch yourself into it without worrying about sounding like a fool. You need basic phrases immediately. You can’t be thinking how do I say ‘away’ or ‘man-on’ when you are in the middle of the game. ‘I have my own English teacher because my girlfriend speaks excellent English. Deciphering accents can be the biggest problem and there are plenty in the dressing room.’ There are also plenty of Spanish speakers at the club, though Big Sam is not one of them. ‘I think he knows “tapas” and “cerveza”,’ says Adrian. ‘But the coaching staff are taking Spanish and French classes.’ Adrian’s family knew all about West Ham from Diego Tristan, a former Betis youth player who played for the club. And Adrian adds: ‘They also signed Manuel Almunia. I was only a kid but when Spanish players come abroad — especially a goalkeeper — you notice which club he has signed for.’ Adrian was aware that former Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia had played for the Hammers before him . The Hammers' goal, under Adrian's stewardship, has seemed impenetrable at times this season . His references also go back to the club’s finest keeper. ‘Don’t worry, I also know who Phil Parkes is! I know he is a legendary keeper for this club and everyone loves him.’ Parkes was in goal the last time West Ham won something, lifting the FA Cup in 1980. Adrian believes the team is moving in the right direction after a good summer in the transfer market. ‘There is a change of style,’ he says. ‘The signings have brought a lot more variety and more options, and now the manager can make decisions and think “how do we approach this game?” We now we have plan A, B or C. ‘You can really build from midfield when you have a player like Alex Song who will always show for the ball and move it on. That helps the team to build from the back and not always play the long ball.’ The one thing Adrian oozes is enthusiasm for the game. He doesn’t overplay it, but having seen two young team-mates lose their lives — Miki Roque and Dylan Tombides both to cancer aged 23 and 20 — it can only have made him more aware of the speed at which not just a career but also life itself can pass a player by. Adrian reacts quickly to make a save against Southampton at the Boleyn Ground . Adrian said the Premier League has grown on him and he thoroughly enjoys life in the competition . ‘I had played with Miki from the youth team,’ he says. ‘We were very close friends because we had come through the youth system together. You never imagine it can happen to a team-mate. Everyone has to die some time, but not someone like Miki who was so young and in the best moment of his life. ‘We have to make the most of life and make the most of times when things are going well. When these tragic things happen you are reminded of what life is about — enjoying being alive.’ He does that mantra justice with his goal celebrations that have endeared him to West Ham fans. ‘You can feel a bit isolated in goal so when the team scores I love to celebrate,’ he says. ‘I can’t go running to the other end of the pitch so I celebrate with the supporters.’ A festive dip in results and the failure to win at Everton in midweek have pegged back expectations. But Adrian still feels West Ham are moving forward. ‘Maybe last season we would always hit teams in the same area so in the end they put a wall there. Now we can vary the approach to get around that. We can really compete.’ As long as Adrian’s wall holds firm at the other end, they will have a chance.","Adrian has excelled since breaking into the West Ham first team .

"Interest in travel to Scotland from the rest of the UK has declined by 29 per cent compared to this time last year, according to new research. Ahead of the Scottish referendum on Thursday, industry experts have expressed concern over what independence could mean for the country's tourism industry - but it looks as though its uncertain future may already be having an impact. According to hotel comparison website trivago.co.uk, hotel searches for Scotland from England, Wales and Northern Ireland between August 1 and September 15 have decreased by 29 per cent compared to the same period last year. Decline: Interest in travel to Scotland from England, Wales, Northern Ireland has decreased by 29% on last year . Money on the mind: Scotland's tourism industry will suffer if it cannot continue using Sterling, says one analyst . The Ryder Cup, one of the biggest tourism events in Scotland, has not managed to boost this decline, with hotel searches for the golfing event also declining year-on-year by 19 per cent. And it's not just the rest of the UK seemingly snubbing Scotland: Interest in travel elsewhere in the UK from Scotland has also decreased by 19 per cent from last year. Denise Bartlett, UK Public Relations at trivago, said: 'With the future of Scottish independence uncertain and many questioning how this will affect both potential visitors and the country’s tourism industry, it is interesting to note that Scotland has already seen a decline in travel interest from the rest of the UK. Recipricol disinterest: Scottish interest in the rest of the UK has also decreased by 19 per cent . 'Despite the Ryder Cup, which was expected to boost Scottish tourism, searches for accommodation in the country have decreased in comparison to last year. 'Although this cannot be attributed wholly to the referendum, it is interesting to note that searches made by Scottish users to the rest of the UK have simultaneously decreased. 'With many in Scotland voting for independence, it appears likely that interest in visiting England, Wales and Northern Ireland has declined.' Industry experts this week expressed concern for Scottish travel if the country votes Yes in the referendum. Impact: Industry experts have expressed concern over the affect of independence on Scottish travel . Tourism is a massively important industry in Scotland, where it employs an estimated 200,000 people and attracted over 2.5 million overseas visitors last year. Visit Scotland, the country's official tourism board, said the industry is worth £11bn and showing faster growth than the country's manufacturing, retail and transport industries. But observers are offering conflicting views over  whether that growth will accelerate or slow down in an independent Scotland. The impact of independence on border controls, currency, visa requirements and travel insurance have all been under scrutiny. Joe Goldblatt, an expert in event tourism in Edinburgh, believes tourism to Scotland will boom if independence wins the vote. Scottish holidaymakers may face a reduction in availability of insurance, says Columbus Direct . He told travel news and data agency Skift: 'In the short term, tourism will dramatically increase in Scotland following independence due to the enthusiasm and interest in Scottish ancestry and culture. 'In the long term, tourism will grow even stronger due to easier and better visa regulations being put in place that will welcome more tourists to Scotland and encourage them to extend their stay to explore different parts of its beautiful land.' And then there is the question of whether an independent Scotland should create a national airline. Faced with the possibility of a new competitor, several aviation bosses told the Independent that Scotland shouldn't bother. Christoph Mueller, chief executive of Aer Lingus, said: 'Don't do it.' Professor Keith Shaw from Northumbria University, who has written an analysis on what he believes could happen if Scotland separates, said: 'There is also a good deal of anxiety about the implications, for Newcastle Airport in particular, of an independent Scottish government committing itself to an immediate 50 per cent reduction in Air Passenger Duty. 'There are also fears that cross-border businesses would suffer from any variation in exchange rates and from the potential administrative costs of dealing with two different currencies.'","Hotel searches for Scotland from England, Wales, Northern Ireland decrease .

In reality, sadly I am 30, but three years off the mark isn't bad for an estimate based on a few clicks of a mouse and some basic questions. Taking the test could not be simpler; participants are presented with a series of changing patterns comprised of a series of grey dots and one red one, and must click on the red dot in order to proceed to the next stage. Altogether, users click on around 50 dots during the test. I shot through the first 10 or 20 clicks at top speed, ignoring the intermittent message informing me I could take a short break in a bid to achieve the most flattering result possible. But as the test went on I noticed myself slowing down, inadvertently clicking on white space instead of the red dot in my haste to hit the target. After a shaky finish, my eventual estimate of 27 was better than I had anticipated. 'We are trying to understand how human motor performance changes with age,' the researchers say. 'We . believe that research should be done in collaboration with people—with . people like you who are interested in learning about themselves and . helping research.' The team also hope the results will show in there are differences in performance around the world. Participants are asked to click on approximately 50 targets of various . sizes, and also also asks a few basic questions about users and their . computer use. At the end of each . experiment, you will see a page with your personalized feedback, which . lets you compare yourself and your performance to people of other . countries. 'By participating, you contribute to research on people's . similarities and differences around the world when interacting with . technology, and more than 100,000 people have participated in experiments on the site.' By building up a database of results from around the world, the researcher hope to find out whether different cultures are more adept to this type of test, and whether cultures that use computers more regularly age in different ways. The team has also developed several other online tests. In one, entitled 'Are you more American or more Japanese?', participants learn whether you they are more sensitive to a focal object (as most Americans) or more attuned to the context (as many Japanese). A second tests emotional intelligence, by asking people to read emotions of others just by looking at their eyes. The final test is designed to find out how different cultures view websites, and find out if colorful websites are more Eastern or more Western.It asks people to give their views of different types of site, ranging from dull to extremely colourful. 'Many people have asked me why LabintheWild is mainly about exploring how we are different and similar in our cultural preferences,' say the lead researcher, known on the site as labrat. 'I guess one of the reasons is that I have always liked to travel and see how people around the world differ from each other. 'What I find fascinating, and what my research has shown, is that these differences also translate to the online world.'","Site developed by researchers at Harvard University .

"Two armed raiders held up three couples leaving a St Louis restaurant shouting: 'This is for Michael Brown,' before running off with their belongings. One of the men was holding a silver gun as the diners, aged between 59 and 61 left the Eleven Eleven restaurant on Mississippi Avenue, in St Louis, Missouri. St Louis Police confirmed that the three couples were walking north on the west side of the street after leaving the restaurant around 11pm on Saturday. The three couples left Eleven Eleven restaurant in St Louis at 11pm on Saturday, when they were attacked . Michael Brown, pictured, was shot dead by police in Ferguson Missouri on August 9 leading to civil unrest . Thousands of people took to the streets following Mr Brown's shooting to protest against police brutality . One of the men brandished a silver gun. Police said both men were black and in their early 20s. The first man was described as being of thin build and wore a white tank-top and blue jeans. He had medium length twisted braids and had a small sliver handgun. The second man was 5'8 and was wearing all black clothes with a black ski mask. According to KSDK.com the Michael Brown reference related to the shooting on August 9 in Ferguson, Missouri of an unarmed black man. Both suspects fled the scene after the robbery. Eleven Eleven restaurant owner Paul Hamilton told KSDK.com: 'We feel for our customers. This is an unfortunate incident. We've been here 11 years and nothing like this has ever happened. It's unfortunate that two young guys would do something like this.' The six diners left Eleven Eleven restaurant and headed north on Mississippi Avenue when they were attacked . Sixth Ward Alderman Christine Ingrassia who represents the area said: 'From the time I've spent in Ferguson and what I've watched from the media, I am 100 percent sure that Mike Brown's family would not think this robbery had anything to do with Mike Brown nor would the rest of us. 'There are a lot of people in our community who are using this Mike Brown situation to let the community know there is something else bubbling below the surface. There are racial issues. There are issues of cyclical poverty here, so I think it's important to at least take note of it.'","A pair of gunmen attack the six diners as they leave the St Louis restaurant .

"Fatima Dyczynski was travelling to Perth to start a new life as an intern for IBM on flight MH17 . The grieving parents of Australian MH17 victim Fatima Dyczynski  saw a lot when they arrived at the Ukrainian crash site but nothing that diminished their belief that their daughter had somehow survived. George and Angela Dyczynski   arrived back in the Netherlands on Tuesday after a five-day trip, during which they achieved something no Australian government-backed humanitarian mission has done, reach the crash site in rebel-controlled eastern Ukraine. At Amsterdam Airport, the Perth-based parents clasped a flyer for the upcoming International Astronautical Congress in Canada and told AAP: 'Fatima is a speaker at the conference.' There was no suggestion the couple's brilliant 25-year-old daughter might not be able to make it to Toronto in late September. Indeed, Mrs Dyczynski later threatened to sue anyone who suggested - without evidence - that Fatima was dead. Her parents also want their daughter's colleagues from the space science community to become involved in the crash investigation. 'She was an aerospace engineer, she was a scientist, she was a young person with new ideas and new perspectives and new horizons,' Dr Dyczynski said on Tuesday. 'We want more scientific investigations with the data that's already gathered. It should start now - not wait months and months until we forget.' Dr and Mrs Dyczynski arrived at Schiphol Airport in the Netherlands last Friday and walked past the MH17 memorial . Dr Dyczynski and his wife, Angela, still hold onto hope that their daughter, Fatima, is alive . The couple say an expert panel including space scientists could help prevent future incidents. Dr Dyczynski believes something is amiss in the world's skies - particularly given the disappearance of MH370 in March. 'Maybe not all things are looked at from the right perspective,' the cardiologist and acupuncturist said. 'Maybe other perspectives are important to investigate. It's not only maybe a missile [that downed MH17] but something more. 'If it would have been a missile, and the rebels shot down this aeroplane, they would not have handed out the black boxes.' It is one thing to question how the plane was brought down, but another to believe a passenger could have survived. The fact the Dyczynskis do is down to a combination of faith and science. 'There is a small possibility that something still survived,' Fatima's father said. 'The people of Donetsk were first at the crash site and if somebody survived maybe they have taken them.' Dr Dyczynski threatened to sue anybody who suggest his daughter was not alive . The couple plan to stay in Amsterdam for two or three days and then likely head home to Australia. They have received support from back home and from Foreign Minister Julie Bishop who wrote to them after the crash. In return, the Dyczynskis left Ms Bishop, who's currently in Kiev, one of four sunflowers they took from the crash site. The remaining three flowers are destined for the Netherlands' Princess Beatrix and Fatima's two grandmothers. When they arrived in the Netherlands on Friday night en route to the crash site, Dr Dyczynski said he and his wife knew the dangers of the war zone, but it was something they had to do. 'Every day we believe she is still alive,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'We believe our daughter is alive and we’re going to look after her. 'We know it’s a dangerous place but we have to go because she is our daughter.' Miss Dyczynski, who is trained in aerospace, aeronautical and astronautical engineering, was moving to Perth to start an internship at IBM . The Dyczynskis were some of the first people to take up the Australian government's offer to fly victims' families to the Netherlands to accompany their loved ones home, if they so wish. Miss Dyczynski, who was trained in aerospace, aeronautical and astronautical engineering, was moving to Perth to start an internship at IBM. Miss Dyczynski was the chief executive and founder of Xoterra Space, a high-tech start-up company developing means to create tiny satellites which would connect mobile phones to directly to space technology.","George Dyczynski and his wife Angela have visited the Ukrainian crash site .

"The stripper who was exchanging Twitter messages with New Jersey Senate hopeful Cory Booker has tried to downplay their conversations after they were exposed on Wednesday. Booker, the 44-year-old Newark mayor who is leading in the race to fill his state’s empty Senate seat, is an active Twitter user and regularly converses with constituents and random followers. His social media habit raised some eyebrows this week after the website Buzzfeed disclosed that he direct messaged with Lynsie Lee, a stripper from Oregon. 'Nothing secret or sexy': Lynsie Lee (left) says that she was just innocently flirting with Newark Mayor Cory Booker (right) Newark Mayor Cory Booker has exchanged flirty messages with a stripper from Portland named Lynsie Lee (pictured) Lee told The Associated Press that the interaction was 'G-rated flirting' that had been blown out of proportion. She called it a '1 out of 10' compared with some of the messages she receives. 'I flirted with him publically, as I do with a lot of people,' Lee said about Booker. 'There was nothing secret or sexy about it.' She said she and mayor never communicated outside Twitter. Lee said she resents any implication that she deliberately leaked the conversation for fame or money. Booker and Lee both had appeared in a documentary about using Twitter. In February, Lee wrote Booker to say the West Coast loved the Newark mayor. Booker wrote back to say the East Coast loves her, 'and by the East Coast, I mean me.' 'Well now I'm blushing,' Lee wrote back. 'It's only fair,' Booker responded. The woman, who goes by the name 'Lynsie Lee' on Twitter, shared direct messages between her and Booker from February . Lynsie Lee tweeted this screen shot of a private message with Booker after a woman tweeted that she and Booker, who is running for Senate, often privately message each other . Lee provided a screenshot of the exchange to BuzzFeed, which published a story Wednesday. She said a jokey, catty feud among the girls in the documentary — all of whom, she said, had a crush on Booker — led her to post the image. She also had fun with her newfound political notoriety. 'If you come to see me at @CasaDiablo tonight, bring your wallets. I'm prime meat for the next couple of days! ;)' she tweeted Thursday. The playful exchange is typical of how Booker engages on Twitter, sending out cheeky answers to marriage proposals, responding to a man with a play on the lyrics to Jay-Z's '99 Problems,' retweeting people with risque usernames and regularly asking followers to send him direct messages. Booker brushed off the exchanges with Lee on Thursday, reiterating that he communicates with 'thousands of people' on Twitter. Booker said he doesn't care what people do for work and the 'puritanical judgment' of Lee was 'over the top.' Unique: Johnny Diablo Zukle is the owner of the vegan strip club where Lee works . Rules: Though Lee is not a vegan herself, the strip club takes an ethical stance against animal abuse . Similar interests: Lee and Booker were featured in the same documentary about Twitter . Booker said he talks to everybody and has no plans to stop. 'You guys might have some prurient interest,' he said, 'but at the end of the day this is about extending kindness to folks.' Lee works at a vegan strip club, making the story even more bizarre given the fact that Casa Diablo claims to be the first of its kind. Booker is a vegetarian, though not vegan. Lee said she's also not vegan. Playful: Lee said that her messages with Booker are far less spicy than other flirtations she has online . Self aware: She jokingly posted on Twitter that she will be 'prime meat' for the next couple days because of her new-found popularity . Booker Republican opponent, Steve Lonegan, called the tweets another distraction in a 'rather bizarre campaign of a cult personality,' complaining that the issues have taken a back seat to Booker's celebrity and use of social media. Booker joked that the fascination had to do with more than a strip club. 'I really think it's because the press corps is obsessed with vegan living,' he said.","The woman, who goes by the name 'Lynsie Lee' on Twitter, shared direct messages between her and Booker from February .

Not alone: Beaudoin allegedly worked with three underage accomplices to break in to 42 homes in the Athabaska and Maple areas . Canadian authorities believe Beaudoin worked with three underage accomplices - ages 13, 15 and 17 - to burgle residence in the Athabaska and Maple areas. The nursing student and her cohorts allegedly broke into the homes using the back door or basement windows. Last week, the Crown filed even more charges against Beaudoin, bringing the total up to a staggering 114 counts. She faces charges of breaking and entering, receiving stolen property, as well as illegally owning and storing a cache of nine firearms. Beaudoin (right) pictured in August with her lawyer Denis Lavigne. She is due back in court on November 17 .

Gunslinger: Beaudoin is also facing charges for illegally owning a storing a cache of nine weapons, which police discovered in the back of her car . Police found the guns in the back of Beaudoin's white Mitsubishi Lancer. 'The record is impressive. I was given a document that [is] at least 12 inches thick,' her lawyer Denis Lavigne told La Nouvelle Union newspaper. Mr Lavigne says his client has seen a doctor to determine her mental state during the time of the robberies. Beaudoin is due back in court on November 17.

"When class favourite Roger the goldfish appeared to have a tumour, staff at the school feared there was only one likely outcome. However the seven-year-old fish has now made medical history after he became the first in Britain to receive microsurgery to remove the growth. Roger has now made a full recovery and is back with pupils at Mont Nicolle primary school in St Brelade, Jersey. George the goldfish became the first in Britain to have a lump removed by a vet in Jersey using microsurgery . Teachers at the school feared Roger had developed cancer and took him to veterinary surgeon Jeremy Miller. Mr Miller had seen a similar, world-first procedure earlier this year on an Australian goldfish called George and offered to repeat the treatment. He cut out the lump using intricate micro-surgery and the procedure went so well, the vet has offered to repeat the treatment. The pet fish was sedated by infusing his tank with anaesthetic before he was removed and placed on a plastic tray with a pipe flowing into his mouth to monitor his tiny heart. Staff feared the seven-year-old goldfish, a favourite at his primary school, had developed a cancerous tumour . Jeremy Miller performed the pioneering surgery on Roger the goldfish at All Pets Veterinary Centre in Jersey . Mr Miller said Roger started swimming round the tank and eating minutes after the surgery was completed . Mr Miller, did the work for free at Jersey's All Pets Veterinary Centre, and said the biggest concern was getting Roger to go to sleep as they were concerned about giving him too much anaesthetic. He said once the fish was unconscious they sprinkled water on his mouth and gills while he got to work removing the tumour. He said: 'We did not know how serious the tumour was or whether it was benign. But it may have grown and got close to his eye. 'It was a bit terrifying but I made it clear that if the operation did no go to plan we might lose him, but we decided the risk was worth taking. Dr Tristan Rich, head of exotics and wildlife medicine at Lort Smith Animal Hospital in Australia performed the world-first surgery on George the goldfish in September that inspired Roger's groundbreaking procedure . 'We did something called an electro cautery. Basically, we have a small wire attached to something like a pen that cuts and coagulates the flesh at the same time so it stops the bleeding. 'We had Roger lying in a plastic dish attached to small probe called a Doppler probe that monitored his heart rate. 'The whole operation only took about five minutes but it took about 45 minutes to get him to sleep. 'I was so delighted when I saw him coming round, I did give a little fist pump.' Electrocautery involves using heat from a metal probe, conducted by an electric current. This allows the cutting through of soft tissue and is known as diathermy. Roger has returned to his school in Jersey . At the same time the heat seals, or cauterises the cut, preventing bleeding. Electrocautery was used for the first time on goldfish Roger in Australia in September this year. Electrocautery is routinely used on humans and is seen as a safer alternative to chemical cautery. It is often used to stop bleeding after an injury or during surgery . Mr Miller said once the surgery was completed Roger woke up around five minutes later and was swimming round the tank and eating. The surgery had been arranged for half-term to give staff at Mont Nicolle primary school in St Brelade, Jersey, the chance to break the news sensitively if it failed. Roger was named after tennis star roger Federer and previously shared his tank with a another goldfish named Rafa - after Rafael Nadal. Roger's tumour developed over the summer holidays after Rafa died and teacher Sarah Anderson thinks it may have been caused by the trauma of losing his companion. Sarah said: 'It seems strange that Rafa died in June and almost immediately the tumour began to grow. 'It was growing rapidly and within a couple of weeks it became very noticeable. 'The kids love him and the first thing they asked when they got back after half-term was 'is Roger OK?' 'We were a bit worried about how they would react if it did not go well, which is why we waited until half-term. 'The children have written about Roger and painted him and will be now writing letters to thank those involved, and the children want to interview Jeremy to ask him questions about what he did. 'He got back on Wednesday and the children are ecstatic.' A biopsy of the tumour has since confirmed it was benign, but it could have grown causing him to go blind had it not been removed.","Teachers feared Roger had cancer after spotted tumour on goldfish's head .

"Jeff Bauman has returned to his job at Costco 14 months after he lost both of his legs in the Boston marathon bombings. In a post on his Facebook page, the 28-year-old is pictured wearing a name tag and smiling alongside two colleagues as he stands behind a cash register while lightly holding his crutches. A caption on the photo, which was posted on Wednesday evening, reads: 'Jeffrey back at work today! W/Mike & Maya @#Costco!' It is not clear if Bauman has returned full-time to the Nashua, New Hampshire store, where he worked for three years before the bombings - but well-wishers on the page congratulated him on his return. He's back! Boston Marathon survivor Jeff Bauman, right, has returned to work at a New Hampshire Costco, according to this picture that was shared on his Facebook profile on Wednesday . 'Was thrilled to see Jeff back to work!' one wrote alongside the picture. 'Big smiles throughout Costco on the faces of all the employees as well as the members! Welcome back, Jeff!!!' Bauman was at the Boston Marathon last year to cheer along his girlfriend, Erin Hurley, and was standing near the finish line when the bombs exploded, killing three people and injuring hundreds. In a now-iconic image, an ashen-faced Bauman was photographed being wheeled to medical attention by three rescuers - including 'the man in the Cowboy hat', Carlos Arredondo. As well as losing his legs, Bauman suffered black eyes and cuts, second degree burns to his back, burns around his eyes and both eardrums had ruptured. Behind the wheel: Bauman, pictured with one of his rescuers Carlos Arredondo, is also driving again . Support: He is pictured at a Costco for a book signing for his book 'Stronger' with his parents earlier this year . After the bombings, Bauman underwent . multiple surgeries and was fitted with often-painful prosthetics as he . slowly learned to walk again - and became a key witness for the FBI as . he remembered seeing one of the Boston bombers before the explosions. In another show of his progress, last month he also shared a photograph to the Facebook page of him driving Arredondo on Memorial Day. In a book he released earlier this year, 'Stronger', he credits his family and colleagues with saving his emotional health, but in particular, he credits his girlfriend Erin with getting him through. The couple became engaged in February and are expecting their first child on July 14. 'I tend to think tragedy gives you perspective,' he wrote. 'Who can I be honest with, without being afraid of their reaction? The answer always came up Erin.' He also fostered a close relationship with Arredondo, who attended sports games with him and often visited him in hospital. Fighter: This picture of Bauman and his rescuers came to represent the horror inflicted on the city last year . Strong: He underwent months of grueling physical therapy with his girlfriend Erin, left, by his side . The men were side-by-side at the finishing line of this year's Boston Marathon - and last month, they were both given honorary degrees from Fisher College, where they delivered this year's commencement speech. Arredondo and his wife lost both of their sons - one to a sniper in Iraq and the other to suicide - and have said that the bombings have allowed them a second chance at family. 'Jeff and Erin, they fill a place - they never could never replace Alex or Brian - but having them in our lives eases things,' Melida Arredondo said. 'It helps, and we just enjoy spending time together.' MailOnline has reached out to Bauman's spokesperson for more information about his return to Costco.

"Suffered a miscarriage in . November 2010 that she believes was triggered by sitting . beneath fluorescent lights at work . Hypersensitive: Hannah Metcalfe, 34, says she suffers adverse effects when she is exposed to electromagnetic waves . She cannot make a call on a mobile phone, have a coffee in an internet cafe or pick up an iPad. So severe is Hannah Metcalfe's sensitivity to electromagnetic waves that her husband has to run errands in town in case she is exposed. The pregnant mother-of-one suffers from electrosensitivity which gives her splitting headaches, stomach cramps, bloating and flu-like symptoms whenever she is exposed to electromagnetic waves. Her sensitivity to modern technology is now so severe that she lives a rural life in the countryside with her partner Mark Terry, 34, where mobiles are banned, cordless phones are forbidden and wifi is not an option. Now eleven weeks pregnant, she is worried for the health of her unborn baby as the condition makes her so ill. Ms Metcalfe suffered a miscarriage in November 2010 that she believes was triggered by being made to sit beneath fluorescent lights at work. She believes her condition was caused by using sunbeds every week as a teenager while under doctor's orders to cure the skin condition psoriasis. Now her condition is so severe she has been forced to quit working as a trainee solicitor. Ms Metcalfe, 34, said: 'I'm not a technophobe, I wanted an iPad just like everyone else. But within minutes of switching on the wifi router to go on the internet I felt really unwell. 'I started to feel an intense build-up of pressure in my head and my digestive system was upset. I had a painful stomach and intense bloating. The symptoms only stopped when I turned it off. 'I was diagnosed with psoriasis aged two and at the age of nine I started having phototherapy treatments, maybe about half a dozen a year, using UVB light. 'Then when I was 19 I bought a UVA/B sunbed for about £500 and I used to use it at home about once a week because I was young and I wanted to wear short skirts like other teens. 'I never had any trouble with the sunbeds but then when I was about 25, I bought a handheld light which was really powerful. If you held it against your skin for just 30 seconds you would burn but the idea was to build up a resistance so you could use it for a minute or so at a time. Modern life ban: As Ms Metcalfe's partner is a a farmer the couple are able to live a rural existence away from the hazards of modern technology . 'It allowed me to finally wear what I wanted and to go to the gym without having to be ashamed of my skin condition. But I think it's what tipped my sensitivity over the edge.' Ms Metcalfe started working shortly after completing a law degree at the University of Kent but soon found that sitting under the fluorescent office bulbs made her ill. When her boss removed them, she felt much better but continued to be exposed to EMF waves outside work. Following a miscarriage in November 2010 Hannah decided to quit the job she loved. She was even forced to stop going to the gym as the fluorescent bulbs were ubiquitous wherever she went. Energy saving lightbulbs at home also . had a negative effect on her health and Hannah had to revert back to . the old-fashioned variety. She said: 'I loved the people I . worked with and I loved my job but gradually the situation with the . lights was getting worse and worse. Hannah, . now a full-time mum to Ollie, three, said 'My boss was really . understanding and at one point was going to fit the whole office with . LED lighting but I knew it wasn't going to get any better. 'In . November 2010 I had a miscarriage and the whole time I had been . pregnant the symptoms had been intensifying. When I lost the baby I was . sure it had to be because of how ill I felt. I think my body had gone . into attack mode. I wanted to carry on working but the miscarriage was . the last straw.' Banned list: In Ms Metcalfe's world cordless phones are banned, iPads are forbidden and mobile phones are not an option . Up to 5 per cent of the general population believe themselves to be affected by electro- or radiosensitivity and experience flu-like symptoms, headaches, lethargy and nausea when exposed to various electrical appliances. It is not recognised as a disability or a medical condition in the UK, . Many medics are sceptical about electromagnetic hypersensitivity syndrome and research has not provided any official statistics. The condition is not officially recognised by the NHS. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES . Electromagnetic waves are everywhere and we are constantly bombarded by them from space. Although there is no evidence of any . permanent damage to the body from electromagnetic waves, some people have reported that they . feel unwell when they are within reach of wi-fi or, occasionally, other . types of electromagnetism. Wi-fi, which Hannah Metcalfe can't go near, uses the same type as mobile phones, TV and radio signals . They are all different in wavelength, so have different properties. Wi-fi waves are higher in frequency than mobile phones and are intense due to the amount of info they carry. So far research has not provided any official statistics. Since then Hannah has found it is not only lighting to which her body reacts. She gets pounding headaches if she uses a mobile phone for just a few minutes and has had to throw out all her cordless phones. In November 2011 she bought a iPad and turned on the wireless router within her home but within half an hour Hannah was experiencing the familiar symptoms of her electrosensitivity and was forced to turn it off. She now cannot go anywhere with wifi internet access as even a brief exposure leaves her bloated, sick and unable to function. She said: 'Before buying the iPad I used to have a coping mechanism and I could go to Starbucks and have a coffee and I guess I just tolerated it. 'But now I can feel the pressure building in my head and my stomach becomes sore and swollen. I would love to be able to go to a cafe or a restaurant with Mark but everywhere seems to have it these days, there's no escape.' As her partner is a farmer the couple are able to live a rural existence away from the hazards of modern technology. However, gadgets are banned in the house and he has to do all of the errands in town so his partner can avoid wifi. Ms Metcalfe is now 11 weeks pregnant but after having a scare just a week ago is concerned her sensitivity to EMF waves could be affecting more than just her. She said: 'I had some very bad bleeding and I was sure I had miscarried again because of what happened the last time but thankfully the baby is fine. 'A few days prior to that I had gone to my midwife appointment and there was wifi in the clinic. I was pretty ill that day and when I came home I started bleeding. 'I can't take any chances now, I know I need to avoid wifi as much as I can. I know it makes me ill and I have to consider what it could be doing to the baby as well. 'I'm in a privileged position because I live in a rural area and at the moment it is possible for me to escape it but having found a Facebook group dedicated to electrosensitivity I know others are not so lucky. 'People who can't work like me don't get any financial support like disability benefit. 'There is lots of research out there about the effects these things have on our bodies and unfortunately it is not being listened to. My fear, for myself and for my kids, is that the technology is moving faster than our understanding of it.' Graham Lambrun, spokesman for Powerwatch, said: 'There are a now a significant number of people who appear to be sensitive to modern wireless technologies. 'A minority of those suffer so severely that they have to resign from their job and move house to minimise their exposure. 'Unfortunately electrosensitivity is not recognised as a disability or a medical condition in the UK, leaving these individuals with no way of financially supporting themselves or their families.'","Hannah Metcalfe, 34, says her condition gives her splitting headaches, stomach cramps, bloating and flu-like symptoms .

"Austrian authorities have ordered a search of secret tunnels beneath a former concentration camp complex where Nazi scientists are believed to have conducted nuclear research in a bid to build an atomic bomb. The probe was triggered by a TV documentary which accessed wartime archives containing blueprints and eyewitness accounts of frantic attempts to beat the Americans in the race for the weapon to win the war. And recently, readings were taken of the area at St Georgen showing elevated levels of uranium  - indications of subterranean implosions seven decades ago. Readings taken at the site of the Gusen concentration camp near St Georgen, Austria show elevated levels of uranium  - indications of subterranean implosions seven decades ago. There are 15 miles of tunnels under Gusen, a sub-camp of Mauthausen (above) where tens of thousands of people were murdered . In January 1944, some 272 inmates of Mauthausen were taken from the camp to nearby St Georgen to begin the construction of secret galleries. By November that year, 20,000 out of 40,000 slave labourers drafted in to build the tunnels had been worked to death. (File picture of concentration camp inmates) The 15 miles of tunnels lie under the nearby Gusen concentration camp site, a sub-camp of the notorious Mauthausen where tens of thousands of people were murdered. At one time, 40,000 slave labourers toiled in the tunnels making war weapons, including Messerschmitt aircraft. But now the hunt is on to find evidence of atomic research after a documentary by filmmaker Andreas Sulzer on Hitler's quest for wonder-weapons beneath the Crystal Mountain unnerved locals. The local authority has already spent £10,000 on preliminary searches of the tunnel system and is now seeking to assemble a team of international experts. One hitherto secret underground borehole found by geothermal imaging devices turned up an empty space yielding no clues as to what it might have been used for. If the Austrian site does render up proof of nuclear research, historians may yet have to rewrite the last chapters of WWII to show how close Hitler might have come to winning it . Stefan Karner, a renowned historian at the University of Graz and head of a conflict research institute, is making his own researches in the area in the belief that plant and machinery related to nuclear research might be found. Sulzer searched archives in Germany, Moscow and America for evidence of the S.S.-led nuke building project. He discovered that on January 2, 1944, some 272 inmates of Mauthausen were taken from the camp to St Georgen to begin the construction of secret galleries. By November that year, 20,000 out of 40,000 slave labourers drafted in to build the tunnels had been worked to death. After the war, Austria spent some £10million in pouring concrete into most of the tunnels. But Sulzer and his backers believe they missed a secret section where the atomic research was conducted. The Soviets were stationed in St Georgen until 1955 and they took all of the files on the site back with them to Moscow. In January 1939, nine months before the outbreak of the war, German chemists Otto Hahn (pictured) and Fritz Strassmann published the results of a historic experiment about nuclear fission . Experts are trying to discover if there is a link between St Georgen and sites in Germany proper where scientists were assembled during the Third Reich in a bid to match American efforts to build the ultimate weapon. In June 2011, atomic waste from Hitler's secret nuclear programme was believed to have been found in an old mine near Hanover. More than 126,000 barrels of nuclear material lie rotting over 2,000 feet below ground in an old salt mine. Rumour has it that the remains of nuclear scientists who worked on the Nazi programme are also there, their irradiated bodies burned in secret by S.S. men sworn to secrecy. The thought of Nazi atomic bomb material stored underground made headlines across Germany and the country's Greenpeace movement backed a call for secret documents relating to the dump to be  released to the state parliament from sealed archives in Berlin.  But they remain secret. It was in January of 1939, nine months before the outbreak of the Second World War, that German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann published the results of a historic experiment about nuclear fission. The German 'uranium project' began in earnest shortly after Germany’s invasion of Poland in September. Army physicist Kurt Diebner led a team tasked to investigate the military applications of fission. By the end of the year, the physicist Werner Heisenberg had calculated that nuclear fission chain reactions might be possible. Although the war hampered their work, by the fall of the Third Reich in 1945, Nazi scientists had achieved a significant enrichment in samples of uranium. If the Austrian site does render up proof of nuclear research, historians may yet have to rewrite the last chapters of WWII to show how close Hitler might have come to winning it.","Readings at site of Gusen camp near St .

"From the 793 attack on Lindisfarne monastery that left the surrounding sea red with blood to the pirate raids so vicious Anglo-Saxon king Ethelred the Unready was forced to pay a yearly tribute to keep them away, the mention of the word Viking was once enough to strike terror into the stoutest of English hearts. But the battling Danes, Swedes and Norwegians weren't just ferocious bearskin-clad warriors. As a new book, Viking: The Norse Warrior's Manual, reveals, the Scandinavian raiders also had a surprisingly creative side. Along with huge caches of elaborately worked swords and jewellery, the period also yielded stunning tapestries, pottery and carving - including some that was executed not by the men, but by women. Terrifying sight: A period drawing depicting a shipload of Viking warriors heading out to sea in a longship . Stunning: A beautifully made silver brooch depicting Odin (left) and a carved animal head unearthed in Norway . Among the most stunning are the Överhogdal tapestries, a collection of intricately detailed works that depict a mixture of Christian and Norse gods, all of which appear to be moving towards a vast ash tree thought to be Yggdrasil - believed to hold nine worlds in its branches in Norse mythology. The works, which are thought to date from between 800 and 1100, were created using wool, a textile common in the Viking world, and dyed using plants found in the surrounding Swedish countryside. But while the tapestries prove that the Vikings had a sensitive side of sorts, most of the creative efforts of the period went into producing one of two things: elaborate boats and status-enhancing jewellery. And it was the elaborate longships that were the first part of Viking craft to appear in the UK, when they appeared off the Northumberland coast in 793. Life meets art: This scene from the Överhogdal tapestries depicts one of the Viking's famous longships . Worship: Among the scenes included in the stunning Överhogdal tapestries is this one which shows Yggdrasil . Elaborate: Treasure, including brooches and bracelets from a large hoard discovered in 1868 at Gnjozdovo . Fiery portents, a dragon seen streaking across the Northumbrian sky and whirlwinds lashing the coast could mean only one thing to the fearful Anglo-Saxons watching the heavens in 793 - doom was imminent. And doom duly came in the shape of the Vikings, who between 793 and 1066 were a hazardous part of life for the Anglo-Saxons. Beginning with the Lindisfarne attack, their power and influence grew until by 849, the year King Alfred the Great was born, they held much of the north and east. Although he managed to halt their advance, raids didn't cease until after the Norman Conquest. And while the Vikings may be gone from British shores, their influence does live on in the English language. Beserk, which means murderous rage, comes from the Anglo-Saxon 'beserker' or clad in bear-skin - an early term used to describe the Vikings. Although the sight of an elegant Viking ship on the horizon usually meant a grisly end for the unlucky Anglo-Saxon watcher onshore, the ships also carried carvings created by some of the finest craftsmen of the age. Carved wooden prows were a key part of the adornment lavished on Viking ships, and many featured animals. One of the most stunning examples of the former to be found in author John Haywood's book, is the animal headed post which once adorned a Viking ship. The work, which was found in the Oseberg Ship burial on a farm near Tønsberg in the Norwegian Vestfold region, is a stylised wooden carving of a dog, its mouth open in a ferocious growl, and its neck beautifully decorated with scroll-work. But while adorning ships was an important strand of Viking art, personal adornment proved just as satisfying for Viking craftsmen. Among the incredible examples of Viking jewels to appear in the book, is an elaborate silver brooch, now tucked away in a Stockholm archive, depicting Odin, the king of the Norse gods. There's also a hoard of silver and gold treasure, discovered near St Petersburg in Russia, that includes striking examples of elaborately detailed brooches depicting everything from country life to the bloody raids that so terrified their Anglo-Saxon neighbours. VIKING: The Norse Warrior’s Manual by John Haywood costs £12.95 and is published by Thames & Hudson . Workplace: Most Viking art was created in the cosy confines of homes such as this one in Fyrkat in Denmark . Spectacular: As the Oseburg Ship, found in a burial mound in Norway, reveals, art and war went together . Intricate: This silver gilt pot, discovered near Harrogate, displays the Viking aptitude for design . Familiar: The warriors seen in the History channel's Viking drama series are the bloodthirsty beserkers of old .","Most of the Vikings' creative urges went into ships and jewellery design .
They also created religious works such as the Överhogdal tapestries .
Other works include brooches showing Norse gods and ship carvings .

"After the dust appeared to have settled from the storm created by the alleged hacking of celebrity iCloud accounts, a new wave of stolen nude celebrity photos have been published online - and actress Gabrielle Union confirmed the photos of her are genuine. Union said in a statement to TMZ alongside her husband Dwyane Wade 'it has come to our attention it has come to our attention that our private moments, that were shared and deleted solely between my husband and myself, have been leaked by some vultures.' Scroll down for video . Victim: Actress Gabrielle Union said in a statement photos of her that were published online are genuine . 'I can’t . help but to be reminded that since the dawn of time women and children, . specifically women of color, have been victimized, and the power over . their own bodies taken from them,' the statement also said. 'These . atrocities against women and children continue worldwide.' In the wake of the stolen images, Union is reaching out to the FBI, TMZ reported. 'For anyone out there also being affected by these and other hacking and hate crimes - We send our love, support and prayers,' the statement also said. ' We have done nothing wrong.' The other previously unseen images are alleged to feature reality TV star Kim Kardashian, American goalkeeper Hope Solo and actresses Kaley Cuoco and Vanessa Hudgens. They also reportedly include Nashville star Hayden Panettiere, singer Avril Lavigne and actress-turned-fashion designer Mary-Kate Olson. It comes just three weeks after naked photos of actress Jennifer Lawrence and '100 other stars', including supermodel Kate Upton and actress Aubrey Plaza, were published online. Although most of the latest victims were named on an original list of targeted celebrities, posted by a hacker to the anonymous image-sharing forum 4chan last month, Kim, also 33, was not. Reality star: Nude pictures allegedly showing TV personality Kim Kardashian (pictured) have been leaked online . Victims: The latest wave of naked images are also alleged to feature actress Vanessa Hudgens (left) and American goalkeeper Hope Solo (right). They were reportedly posted to image-sharing forum 4chan and Reddit . Targeted: Kaley Cuoco (left), who plays Penny in The Big Bang Theory (right), was named as a victim last month . According to TMZ, the images were reportedly uploaded to 4chan and Reddit, but the latter quickly removing them due to its stringent policy on hacked photographs being shared on the site. While a representative for Kim declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline, the snaps which allegedly feature her have garnered much attention. They show a woman who resembles the star taking nude selfies in a bathroom setting. It is not the first time Kim, who is married to rapper Kanye West, has had to deal with racy material being leaked to the public. In 2007, her sex tape with then-boyfriend Ray-J was published online. The reality star filed a lawsuit against the tape's distributors, Vivid Enetrtainment, which was finalled dropped when she settled for $5 million. Actress: Hayden Panettiere was also allegedly a victim in the latest online leak of naked celebrity photos . Another victim: According to E! Online, nude photos allegedly showing singer Avril Lavigne (pictured) and actresses Leelee Sobieski and Lake Bell have also been uploaded online. Posing: It is not the first time Kim (pictured, right, in a Twitter image), married to Kanye West (left), has had to deal with racy material being leaked to the public. In 2007, her sex tape with then-boyfriend Ray-J was leaked . The same year, Vanessa was forced to issue an apology after private photos of her were leaked online at the time she was appearing in Disney's High School Musical 2. According to E! Online, nude photos allegedly showing actresses Leelee Sobieski and Lake Bell were also uploaded online this morning. Three weeks ago, compromising images of dozens of celebrities - including model Cara Delevingne and Jessica Brown Findlay - emerged online after a hacker reportedly gained access to their iCloud accounts and stole their pictures. While it appears that she was unaffected by the attacks, actress Cameron Diaz recently expressed her thoughts on the scandal while in London to promote her latest movie Sex Tape. Scandal: It comes just three weeks after naked photos of actress Jennifer Lawrence (left) and '100 other stars', including supermodel Kate Upton and actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead, were published online . Stars: Mary Elizabeth Winstead (left) tweeted that nude photographs of her were taken with her husband 'years ago in the privacy of our home', while actress Aubrey Plaza (right) was also an alleged victim of the leak . Speaking on ITV's This Morning, she said: 'Whoever has done it, they will be caught and made examples of. This can happen to anyone. 'If these guys can do it to this group of people then everyone's vulnerable to it. 'I think that people really need to look at... how would they feel if it happened to them?' The hacking is believed to have been the result of 'a very targeted attack' on celerbrity's ICloud accounts . Last month, actress Kirsten Dunst became the first celebrity to publicly criticize technology giant Apple when she posted a sarcastic message on Twitter. The Spiderman star tweeted 'Thank you iCloud', the day after naked photos of her were published online. Meanwhile, Jennifer Lawrence, a three-time Oscar nominee who won for her role in Silver Linings Playbook, contacted authorities after the images began appearing. 'This is a flagrant violation of privacy,' Lawrence's publicist Liz Mahoney wrote in a statement. 'The authorities have been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.' Apple has denied that its iCloud system was compromised during the attacks, which were the result of 'a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions'. 'We take user privacy very seriously and are actively investigating this report,' Apple spokeswoman Nat Kerris earlier told MailOnline. The firm, which said it was 'outraged' by the security breach, has now advised worried customers to update their accounts with a 'strong' password and enable two-step verification. 4Chan is an image-based forum where users can post photos and videos anonymously, as well as comment on others' posts. Registration is not required, nor possible. The site is split into various boards, each with their own specific content and guidelines. These include content on music, photography, gaming, comics, fashion and images of celebrities, such as Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton and Kim Kardashian. Forum: In the latest hack, the nude celebrity photos were posted on 4chan, before being shared on forums on Reddit. Above, 'The Fappening' subreddit allows thousands of subscribers to view the graphic pictures . Its main board, called 'Random', features minimal rules on what can be posted. It is often where controversial images and videos are uploaded by users. When it launched in 2003, the site was used to post photos and discuss Japanese anime. However, it quickly expanded, and is now linked to various internet subcultures and activism. It has also been linked to a number of high-profile hacks. Last month, actress Kirsten Dunst became the first celebrity to publicly criticize technology giant Apple when she posted a sarcastic message on Twitter . In 2006, users of 4chan and other websites 'raided' American white nationalist Hal Turner by launching multiple attacks and prank calling his phone-in radio show. Meanwhile, in 2008, the Yahoo email account of Sarah Palin was hacked by an anonymous 4chan user, before posting her password and screenshots on Wikileaks. In the latest hack, the nude celebrity photos were posted on 4chan, before being shared on forums on Reddit and other social networking sites. One such forum, called 'The Fappening', allows thousands of subscribers to view the graphic pictures, provides advice on how to share them online and protects the identity of the unnamed hacker. In a post a few weeks ago, the moderator of the subreddit told users that they must not post any information, true or false, about the identity of the person leaking the photos. He or she wrote: 'If you do that, you will be banned from this subreddit.' The moderator, using the handle 'thefappeningmod', went on to list an array of other domains that subscribers can use to access the nude pictures. Every time the subreddit, along with 'live updates' is deleted, a new forum is opened. According to a recent report from the live broadcast, the hacker has more than 2GB worth of footage that they may release to the public for free. Other celebrities named in the original list of 'victims' that are yet to see any photos appear include actress Selena Gomez, model Cara Delevingne, Hilary Duff and Rachel Nicols.","New wave of nude celebrity photos have been leaked on 4chan and Reddit .

"The amphibian-version of Nigella Kitchen appears to be a hit with these leopard frogs. A recent video shows the creatures in a frenzy after discovering an iPhone at the back of a shed. Footage of wiggling worms is then played to the crowd of hungry frogs who leap, pounce and hurl themselves at the glass. Scroll down for videos . The video (grab pictured) was uploaded to the YouTube by user Joe Myers. It shows an iPhone placed behind a sheet of glass. A clip of worms is then played on the device to a crowd of frogs . Throughout the video, the crowd increases in size and at one point there are more than 17 frogs all scrambling to get the best view. And it’s lucky the phone is shielded, because frogs have been known to pull three times their own body weight using just their tongue. While worms are part of their staple diet, leopard frog have also been known to eat other small frogs, and their large mouths can even swallow small birds and snakes. The video, which already has 12,000 hits on YouTube, was uploaded four days ago by Ohio-based Joe Myers. 'Quite a crowd gathers only moments after I put it on their favorite channel!' Mr Myers wrote on his Facebook page. 'I had to put the glass cover over it or they kept changing the channel.' Throughout the video (grab pictured) the crowd increases in size and at one point there are more than 17 frogs all scrambling to get their tongues on the worm. And it’s lucky the phone was shielded, because frogs have been known to pull three times its body weight using just its tongue . The leopard frog is most often recognised as the specimen used in science classes for dissection. Their name comes from the pattern of irregularly shaped dark spots that cover their backs and legs. They are greenish-brown in colour with a white underside and light-coloured ridges on either side of their backs. The frogs can reach lengths of three to five inches (7.6 to 12.7cm) with the males slightly larger than females. While worms are part of their staple diet, leopard frog have also been known to other small frogs, and their large mouths can even swallow small birds and snakes. It isn't the first time the animal kingdom has become engrossed in video footage. A recent study found monkeys in the wild not only love watching videos, but they also tend to copy the behaviour seen on screen. When scientists showed marmosets footage of a monkey opening a box to get a banana, they were able to replicate what they saw and open the box themselves. The study, undertaken in Pernambuco, Brazil, revealed new insights into how monkeys learn from each other in the wild, according to Austrian and Scottish researchers. While leopard frogs may be more enticed by flickering lights than footage of worms, scientists believe wild monkeys could prove that 'how-to' videos work just as well in the wild. ‘How-to’ videos have been a success when shown to monkeys in captivity, but this is the first time they were used to train creatures in the wild . Twelve of the marmosets were able to open the box, 11 of which had seen it done first in a video. One monkey could do it after just seeing the still image .","The video was uploaded to YouTube by Ohio-based user Joe Myers .

"A footballer's wife has defended her decision to post an image of her flat stomach four days after she gave birth. Caroline Berg Eriksen - who is married to Norwegian Premier League player Lars-Kristian . Eriksen - was criticised for putting pressure on other new mothers to lose weight with the photograph. Bloggers have said that to get the washboard waist in such a short space of time was physically impossible, but the 26-year-old has said she did not intend on upsetting anyone with the selfie. Selfie: WAG Caroline Berg Eriksen posted this image of her flat stomach on Instagram, four days after she gave birth . New mother: Caroline Berg Eriksen, pictured with her baby daughter this week, has provoked outrage among the blogging community with the post . The photograph, which was posted on Instagram, shows her standing in front of a mirror in black and pink lace underwear. Underneath, there a caption that reads 'I feel so empty and still not, 4 days after birth'. Mrs . Berg Eriksen, who runs the most visited blog in Scandinavia under the . name Fotballfrue, or 'The Footballer's Wife', prompted one . blogger to criticise the move as 'wildly provocative.' Writer Suzanne Aabel said she couldn't be sure if Mrs Berg Eriksen even 'belonged to the same species'.  She said: 'In my eyes, . this picture is wildly provocative.' Commenting . on the post, one writer Heidi said: 'Is it really necessary to post a . halfnaked picture of themselves?! It's just to show off, thinking's not . much on how that image can affect readers.' Commenting on the photo on Instagram, one user laurajanewilkes said, 'Can she look like this 4 days after???' Pregnancy: The blogger, who is married to footballer Lars-Kristian Eriksen, is well known in Norway as a health and fitness writer . The amount of traffic to her website has doubled since the scandal to two million visitors as the semi-nude image spread online. Mrs Berg Eriksen, who lives in a rural Norwegian town with her husband who plays for Odd Grenland and daughter, told Good Morning America: ‘I . think that all women should be proud of themselves, regardless of how . they look after labour. Happy couple: The blogger is married to Norwegian Premier League player Lars-Kristian Eriksen, pictured . ‘During the pregnancy people kept telling me that my body would never would be the same. ‘I wanted to tell everybody that that is not entirely true. Right after birth, like three minutes after, I felt like myself again.’ Mrs Berg Eriksen has previously replied to her . critics on Facebook, saying: 'I let out the picture because I'm proud of . myself and my body for something as tough as a pregnancy / birth, and I . think all mothers, regardless of the body shall be.' The blogger was also backed by Gro Nylander, head of the women's clinic at the Norwegian National Hospital. According to the Local, she said: 'I don't think we should bully The Footballer's Wife. 'Life is unfair, some people have flat stomachs while others have pouts.' The doctor added that new mothers must understand that every body responds differently to pregnancy and that is was not productive to compare to other women. 'The most imporant thing is to be kind to your body. It's a positive thing to have a few extra kilos on your body after birth,' she said. Mrs Berg Eriksen studied journalism at the Norwegian School of Creative Studies before becoming a fitness and health blogger, writing about her six-day-a-week workout programme and following the  LCHF (low carb-high fat) diet.","Norwegian WAG Carolin Berg Eriksen posted 'provocative selfie'

"Disgraced celebrity chef Paula Deen today said she has learned 'so much' following her racism scandal last year - and vowed to come back stronger than ever. A year after her famous meltdown on the Today show, Deen returned to chat with Matt Lauer  about her 'dark and difficult' year and made it clear  she has not been deterred. When asked what she had learned after she admitted to using the 'n' word, Deen  said  people could find  out by watching her self-made documentary on her new Paula Deen Network - for $9.99. 'I really feel it's going to require another book,'  she said. Scroll down for videos . Comeback: Paula Deen appeared on the Today show on Tuesday - a year after her famous meltdown. She apologized for her hurtful words and discussed plans for her new network, which launches tomorrow . Support: She appeared on the  show with her sons Jamie and Bobby, who will also appear on the network . Last year, a former restaurant employee accused Deen of racial discrimination and sexual harassment, and in a deposition, Deen admitted to previously using racial slurs. It also emerged she had quipped about a 'Southern style wedding' featuring African-American servants. As more details emerged, she was dropped by the Food Network and sponsors. She also appeared on the Today show, where she became hysterical as she begged for forgiveness. 'I didn't recognize that woman,' Deen said on Tuesday. 'That was a woman in trauma and shock, trying to understand what had happened. The cold hard fact was that I probably should not have been here but perhaps under the care of a doctor.' After the show, she went home and thought about what had happened, she said. 'I had to go home, sit on my sofa and get off the merry-go-round so I could think and see things from all the angles,' she said. What a difference a year makes: Deen  broke down on the Today show amid the scandal last year . 'I've learned so much over the year... The most powerful thing - the power of words. I don't care how old they are, words are so powerful, they can hurt. 'Frankly I disappointed myself. And for that I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry for the hurt I caused people. Because it went deep.... I'm here to make people happy, not to bring sadness.' Now, she said, she is trying to forget the past and looking to the future. After realizing that she still had an immense body of supporters, she decided to launch the Paula Deen Network and bought all of her content from the Food Network - but would not disclose the price. She explained that fans can also find out more about her tumultuous year in a documentary, which is set to launch on the network - but it'll cost them. The documentary will only be available to subscribers of her new website, which launches on Wednesday. Recipes on the site will be free, but viewers  need to pay $9.99 a month to view videos. She added in an earlier interview: 'We hope to have it out the first of the year and tell everybody the true story of what really happened. It was a painful year for me. It was a hurtful year when I found myself being labeled for something I was not.' The website will feature an ambitious array of original video content, including traditional cooking shows as well as lifestyle and game show segments featuring Deen and her sons. The site, which will include no outside advertising or sponsors, also includes thousands of Deen's recipes, as well as menu planning tools. Looking to the future: Deen and her two sons will launch the Paula Deen Network on Wednesday after buying all of her content from the Food Network. It will include videos, recipes and documentary about her past year . The plans are part of a larger effort by the star and her backers to resuscitate her career after the public relations disasters cost her nearly all her book, TV and endorsement deals. In 2012, just before the race scandal exploded, Deen announced that she had developed Type-2 Diabetes - and she was widely criticized for promoting her brand of high-fat, sugary Southern cuisine and for scoring a lucrative endorsement deal for a drug to treat the condition she'd   hidden. In 2013, a former manager at Deen's restaurants in Savannah, Georgia, sued her and her brother for sexual and racial harassment - and in a deposition, Deen acknowledged using the 'N word'. Her former employee, who was white, was eventually forced to drop the racial part of her lawsuit - and Deen lamented that this had not been given as much airplay as the woman's initial claims. 'Of course the statement that was released at the end got almost no attention,' Deen said on the Today show. She is now hoping that her new network will give her a degree of creative and financial control. 'That's the beauty of what we're doing now. We have total and complete control,' she told the Wall Street Journal. 'If we disagree on something, we can discuss it right then and there... It's as real as it can get.'","Beleaguered chef was reunited with Matt Lauer on Tuesday, a year after she broke down in tears on the Today show .

"Budget supermarkets Aldi and Lidl are enjoying a surge in sales as shoppers desert the ‘big four’ chains. Sales at Aldi rose 35.3 per cent in the past 12 weeks, compared with the same period a year ago, while the figure at Lidl was 17.2 per cent. By contrast, as the German chains open shops at the rate of one a week, Tesco continues to lose sales despite a £1billion turnaround plan. Its sales in the past 12 weeks were down by 3 per cent on a year ago. Both Aldi and Lidl have seen a surge in sales while the 'big four' supermarkets continue to struggle . Morrisons suffered an even bigger fall of 3.8 per cent. The drop at Sainsbury’s was 1.7 per cent, while Asda proved the most resilient of the major stores with a fall of 0.5 per cent. The decrease in sales at the big four partly reflects the fact that Easter falls later this year, on April 20 compared with March 31 last year. This means the latest figures, from the retail analysts Kantar Worldpanel, do not cover a busy period featured in last year’s. Tesco's sales in the past 12 weeks were down by 3 per cent on a year ago, however this fall has been exaggerated by the fact Easter falls later this year. Last week, the company announced that one of its most senior executives, the finance director, Laurie McIlwee, has decided to leave amid rumours of a clash over the direction of the business. Sales at Tesco in the past 12 weeks were down by 3 per cent on a year ago . Britain’s biggest retailer is due to publish its annual profits next week, which are expected to show a fall of £200million to £3billion. Morrisons suffered an even bigger sales fall of 3.8per cent over the last 12 weeks. The company appears particularly vulnerable to the threat from the budget chains and has announced it is cutting prices by £1billion over three years to try and take them on. Sainsbury’s, which has previously been immune to the threat of Aldi and Lidl, saw sales fall by 1.7 per cent, while the figure at Asda was down by 0.5per cent. Total sales growth for all supermarkets over the 12 weeks was just 0.6per cent compared to a year ago. Morrisons saw sales fall by 3.8 per cent despite announcing it is cutting prices by £1billion over three years . The study says the figure would still have been a very modest 1.5per cent if Easter had fallen at the same time this year. Edward Garner, of Kantar, said: ‘Amid a challenging market backdrop, individual retailer growth might be expected to be restricted. ‘This is certainly not the case for Aldi which achieved its highest ever growth of 35.3 per cent , boosting the retailer to a record market share of 4.6 per cent.   Lidl also experienced strong growth in a record breaking month and now accounts for 3.4per cent of the market. ‘All of the ‘big four’ supermarkets have faced declining sales over the past 12 weeks, which has been accentuated by the late falling of Easter.  Nevertheless, they have also seen worrying share declines.’ Aldi and Lidl have made a concerted effort to attract middle income families with everything from fresh Aberbeen Angus fillet steaks at £5 each to award winning wine, coffee and cheese. Waitrose has managed to hold on to its record 5 per cent market share, while the Co-Op appears to have stemmed falls in sales.","Aldi sales rise 35.3 per cent in the past 12 weeks compared to same period last year .

"Young love: Arin Andrews, 16, pictured left, with girlfriend Katie Hill, 18, were both born the opposite sex . To the casual observer, this young couple look just like any other teenagers in love. But pretty Katie Hill and her boyfriend Arin Andrews share a unique bond - they were both born as the opposite sex. Katie, 18, spent the first 15 years of her life as Luke, son of a Marine colonel, while Arin, 16, was born a girl called Emerald who excelled at ballet dancing and won beauty contests. Both struggled with their sexuality all through their childhoods and were teased and bullied but their lives were changed when they both began hormone therapy and later met at a trans support group in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and instantly fell in love. Katie said: 'All I saw was a handsome guy. We're perfect for each other because we both had the same troubles growing up. 'We're both size five, so we even swap our old clothes our mum's bought us but we hated. 'We look so convincing as a boy and a girl, nobody even notices now. We secretly feel so good about it because it's the way we've always wanted to be seen.' High-school student Arin undergoes testosterone shots to give him the more masculine shape he's craved his whole life. Meanwhile high-school graduate Katie, 18, has finished her female hormone course - oestrogen shots - which helped her to develop natural breasts with no silicone implants. Katie, who has legally been a female since she was 15, believes she was born with naturally high levels of oestrogen and was teased as a boy throughout school for having small AA-cup breasts. An anonymous donor was so touched by her story they paid for her £25,000 ($40,000) gender reassignment surgery just four days after her 18th birthday on May 16, 2012. Katie added: 'Even from age three, I knew deep down I wanted to be a girl. All I wanted was to play with dolls. I hated my boy body and never felt right in it. Scroll down to watch video . Boy meets girl, girl meets boy: Arin Andrews, 16, left, was once a girl called Emerald while his girlfriend Katie Hill, 18, right, was born a boy called Luke . Before the transgender treatment: Emerald Andrews, pictured left at the age of four at dance recital in Tulsa, Oklahoma, before she became Arin, and Luke Hill pictured right at the age of five before he became Katie . Costly: Katie underwent gender reassignment surgery earlier this year after a £25,000 anonymous donation . 'I kept my feelings a total secret growing up and was petrified of what people in our tiny Christian town would say. Now Arin and I can share any problems we face together.' Arin recalls a similar experience and says he knew he was a boy inside from his first day at school, aged just five. 'The teachers separated the girls and boys into separate lines for a game,' he said. 'I didn't understand why they asked me to stand with the girls. Lucky in love: The sweethearts met through a support group for young transsexuals in their hometown in Oklahoma, America . 'Girly things didn't interest me, but I was worried what people would think if I said I wanted to be a boy, so I kept it secret.' Arin's mother Denise, 41, encouraged him to compete in local pageant contests and he became an accomplished female ballet and clogging dancer. But Arin's secret love was riding motocross bikes with his father Mitch, 42, and doing triathlons and rock-climbing. 'Mum and dad argued when my motocross clashed with my dance schedule,' he said. 'But at age 11, mum gave up. She couldn't win. But I'll never hold it against her. She was just proud of her only daughter.' Mrs Andrews now supports Arin by helping with his testosterone shots and has vowed to help him pay for breast removal surgery if he can raise half of the £3770 ($6,000) costs himself. For the time being, Arin hides his chest by 'binding' - tight strapping around the torso use by transgender females-to-males. Even Arin's little brother Wesley, 11, has even started calling Arin his 'big brother'. 'It makes me so proud,' said Arin. Arin's determination to live his life as a male comes after years of 'humiliating' bullying throughout school. 'It was horrible,' said Arin. 'I looked like a pretty girl but acted and walked like a boy. 'Everyone started calling me a lesbian. It felt so humiliating. I didn't feel gay at all. 'I started having suicidal thoughts and told my parents I felt confused, but I didn't even know transgender people existed, so it didn't come up. 'They said it was OK to be gay, but put me into therapy for my depression and to help with my confusion. My feelings of being a boy sounded so stupid I didn't even say it in therapy. 'Then a student at my school, a Christian school, told the teacher's office about a girl I was dating. 'They kicked me out because it was a religious school, even though I was a top pupil. 'I started another school and things have been better there. But everything changed when I met Katie.' 'Keeping his true feelings a secret': Emerald Andrews, before she became Arin, at the age of five in Tulsa, Oklahoma . Support: Both Arin and Katie were bullied growing up in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and they want to help prevent that from happening to others . Encouraging education': Both Arin and Katie spent much of their childhood confused about their identity before they discovered the term 'transgender' The past: Arin poses next to a portrait of himself when he was still known as Emerald . Arin realised he wasn't alone after reading about Katie's transition from male to female in their local newspaper. A girl at heart: Luke Hill, before he became Katie, aged seven . 'All her loneliness and confusion over feeling she was the opposite gender all her life sounded exactly like me,' added Arin. 'It was the moment I first had an explanation for my feelings. I realised I was 'trans' too. I finally had an answer after years of confusion.' The pair eventually met in a local trans support group and hit it off. 'She was beautiful and looked just like Megan Fox,' said Arin. 'I longed to know who she was and eventually plucked up the courage to do the guy thing and ask for her number. 'She said yes and we started seeing each other.' Katie had only learned what 'transgender' meant by browsing the internet when she was 15. 'I'd been so unhappy growing up,' she . said. 'As I got older it got worse and I couldn't help being really . girly with a high-pitched voice and high cheekbones.' Katie's . mother Jazzlyn, 44, and father Randy, 58, a Lieutenant Colonel in the . United States Marine Corps, struggled to deal with their son's confused . feelings at first. Graduate: Katie Hill, 18, smiles at her family as she waits to get her diploma during Bixby High School's graduation ceremony . Graduating grin: Katie, pictured with her mother Jazzlyn, is the first openly transgender teen to graduate from a high school in Oklahoma . Inspiring: Katie said she wants to share her story and help other transgender children . 'My parents were scared stiff and put me through 15 therapist to try and cure my depression,' said Katie. 'None helped because nobody suggested I was trans and I didn't know what it was. 'When I was 15 I found the word 'transgender' while desperately searching the internet and instantly knew it was me. 'Mum was so terrified of losing me. 'I'd once tried to end my life, so she agreed to help me. I owe her everything. 'We made a list of all the things I wanted to do, like wearing bras and panties, getting hormone therapy and maybe one day having gender realignment surgery. 'My brothers and even my grandma Judy were so accepting I was shocked. 'Dad was upset at first because he felt like he was losing his first son. 'Over time he's learned to accept me and now calls me his ""daughter"", which makes me smile.' The couple are speaking out about their experience to help raise awareness of trans issues. 'More needs to be done to let people know about transgender issues,' said Katie. 'We both spent years in the wilderness and felt so alone. 'Our parents didn't know how to help because none of us knew being trans was possible. 'Nobody should have to go through what we did.' Now watch the video .

"They were a race of ferocious warriors, famous for their terrifying seaborne attacks and incredible shipbuilding abilities. But if you thought the age of the Vikings was past, Björn Jakobsen, 66, king of a band of modern-day warriors from Malmö in Sweden, is living proof that for some, they never really went away. Part of a community living and working in the Viking town Foteviken on the southern Swedish coast, Björn says the life of a Viking is a fascinating one and adds he has no plans to return to modern life. Viking life: King Björn (centre) and the other Vikings live and work in the village 24 hours a day, 365 days a year . 'It's a mysterious lifestyle,' he elaborates. 'Of course I can go into modern times as . soon as I step outside the village. 'I could just go and watch the TV but . when I do come back to the village after [venturing out], I realise how . beautiful [living like a Viking] is.' For King Björn and his band of Viking warriors, daily life in Foteviken includes making time to work the surrounding fields and feasting on porridge, although as king, Björn doesn't have to work if he doesn't feel like it. 'I just declared it,' he says of the moment he was crowned king of the Viking village. 'I said OK I am king. It was my decision. 'We have people visiting the village . every day and I spend time communicating with them,' he adds. Home: King Björn outside his traditional Viking home in the village of Foteviken near Malmö . Peaceful: Björn, who unilaterally declared himself king, says he loves the relaxed lifestyle in Foteviken . Fiery portents, a dragon seen streaking across the Northumbrian sky and whirlwinds lashing the coast could mean only one thing to the fearful Anglo-Saxons watching the heavens in 793 - doom was imminent. And doom duly came in the shape of the Vikings, who between 793 and 1066 were a hazardous part of life for the Anglo-Saxons. Most came from Denmark, although Norwegian Vikings were also known to have had a taste for British gold. Either way, following the Lindisfarne attack, Viking power and influence grew until by 849, the year King Alfred the Great was born, they held much of the north and east. Although he managed to halt their advance, raids didn't cease until after the Norman Conquest. And while the Vikings may be gone from British shores, their influence does live on in the English language. Beserk, which means murderous rage, comes from the Anglo-Saxon 'beserker' or clad in bear-skin - an early term used to describe the Vikings. 'All the . other Vikings will be out working in the fields and working on the farm but I can . spend my time just looking around, or sailing or enjoying a chat or . playing a game.' But while Björn ensures life in the Viking village is as authentic as possible, there's one part of Viking life that he's not allowed to recreate. 'Really, it depends what you mean by raids,' he muses. 'We have friends in [other Viking communities] in Europe and we visit each other and each other's . markets. 'We swap Viking tools. We travel all over the place because . there are Vikings all over Europe.' While raids on the British coast might be out of the question, there are still some other forms of entertainment available to Bjorn and his band of modern-day Vikings. Most exciting of all are the feast days when Bjorn and his cohorts get to swap their daily fare for a meat-heavy feast. 'Everyone thinks it was meat and meat and . meat,' he explains of his Viking forebears. 'But it wasn't, they ate with their hands and it was berries and . pork. 'They eat porridge and bread every day along with a very light . beer. If they kill an animal they don't waste it, they eat it.' He adds: 'If a . Viking has done well like pulling in a ship then they get a strong beer . and meat as a reward - as a celebration of what they've done.' Björn, who says his family - all of whom do normal jobs and live in modern homes - come to stay with him in the village in the summer, is also keen to rehabilitate the reputation of the Vikings. They weren't, he says, just ferocious warriors and they most certainly didn't live in furs and horned helmets - for some of the time at least. Old fashioned: All cooking in Foteviken is done over open fires, while food comes from the fields or storerooms . In charge: Björn doesn't have to work so spends his days chatting to visitors or sailing his boat . 'Everyone thinks that Vikings have horns,' he complains. 'They don't. They wore clothes made from silk and linen and had a bow . and a spear for killing. 'Some Vikings had helmets to protect themselves and some might have . had pieces of metal sticking out but not horns. 'You can't have . horns because if you think about it, if you are fighting with horns, . someone could grab those horns and drag you down - it's very dangerous.' Happily for Björn, there's not much fighting to be done when you're a modern-day Viking and he says he wouldn't have it any other way. 'Modern day life is so rushed with all . this modern technology,' he explains. 'Here you can relax and look at the sea and see . the sunset. You can sit still.' King Björn and his Viking warriors appear on Outsiders with Darren McMullen, Friday at 10pm on National Geographic Channel.","Björn Jakobsen is the ruler of a band of modern-day Swedish Vikings .
Lives in a small village and lives exactly as a Viking would have done .
He and other villagers live Viking lives 24hrs a day, 365 days a year .

Sadly for Björn, Vikings can no longer go on raids so UK coast is safe ."
"One of the most important Roman sites in Britain - dubbed the Pompeii of the North - has been saved after being sold in a £2 million deal. The Auckland Castle Trust bought the Roman Town in Binchester, which hit headlines in the summer after a treasure trove of 1,800-year-old remains and jewellery were uncovered there by archaeologists. Fears had been growing that the site was going to be split after the Church Commissioners who own the land put it up for sale over two separate lots. The Auckland Castle Trust bought the Roman Town in Binchester, (pictured). The site hit headlines in the summer after a treasure trove of 1,800-year-old remains and jewellery were uncovered there by archaeologists. Fears had been growing that the site was going to be split and sold off to developers . Binchester, which stands near the River Wear in the north of England, was known to the Romans as Vinovia. It commanded the main road that ran from the legionary headquarters at York north to Hadrian’s Wall. Historians claim it was a key element of the complex frontier system that lay both sides . of the Wall which marked the northern-most edge of the Roman Empire for . nearly 400 years. The fort itself was built in the second half of the first century AD, when the Romans were establishing its power in the North East. Originally, Romans used wood to build the structure, and later rebuilt it in stone when they believed it would become a permanent base. Romans from all over the world used the fort. For instance, historians believe a cavalry unit from Spain used it in the 2nd century AD. A separate group made up of Dutch tribesmen used the fort in the 3rd century AD. The latest find provides an unparalleled opportunity to better understand life on the northern frontier in the Roman period. For example, the altar is a reminder . that bath houses were about more than keeping clean and exercising and . were actually social centres - a bit like our modern day leisure centres. Among other things, the Roman Empire began the practice of taking a census of all the people within its boundaries every so often. The site  also reveals their expertise in straight roads, central heating and concrete. Sites such as Binchester were a proving ground for aspiring politicians and a powerbase for usurping emperors. If the sites had each fallen into separate hands, it would have made public access to, and academic research on, the historical attraction more difficult. But after originally rejecting the £2 million bid, the Church Commissioners have now accepted the  offer for the fort, situated on the banks of the River Tyne. The good news comes following a campaign launched last month by the Trust. More than 4,000 people signed it in an attempt to save the famous site and urge the Church Commissioners not to sell the Binchester plots to separate buyers. Dr Chris Ferguson, head curator at Auckland Castle said: ‘This is wonderful news and we are delighted that Binchester will now be protected for future generations. ‘Contracts still have to be exchanged, but the Auckland Castle Trust has successfully come through the tender process as the preferred bidder and now we can start to look to the future of this vitally important site and ensure its past and status as one of not just Britain’s but Europe’s most important Roman sites is secured. ‘Here at Auckland Castle we have been thrilled by the goodwill and support we have received from so many people as we strove to raise awareness about Binchester and our bid to save it for the nation.’ He added: ‘Our first priorities are to secure the site for the winter, work with Durham County Council and English Heritage to help shape Binchester’s future and to start pulling together plans to ensure the Roman remains continue to be available for archaeologists and the public to enjoy for generations to come. The discoveries at Binchester Roman Fort near Bishop Auckland, made in July, date back 1,800 years and include a silver ring - said to be one of the earliest pieces of evidence for Christianity in Roman Britain. Buried on the site of a Roman fort in County Durham, archaeologists made a series of well-preserved and extraordinary finds. The discoveries date back 1,800 years and include one of the earliest pieces of evidence for Christianity in Roman Britain in the shape of a silver ring (pictured) The many finds at the site also include this small carnelian intaglio, which is thought to have been worn as jewellery. More than 4,000 people signed a petition to save the famous site and urge owners, the Church Commissioners not to sell the Binchester plots to separate buyers . Archaeologists also discovered a bath house with seven-foot high walls, once covered with brightly-painted designs and have dubbed the region 'Pompeii of the north.' The bath house was also found with the original floor, doorways and window openings. Elsewhere on the site, an inscribed altar dedicated to the Roman Goddess Fortune the Home-bringer, was unearthed. ‘These findings are hugely significant as they are virtually intact and present a graphic illustration of life under the Roman Empire,' said Dr David Mason, principal archaeologist for Durham County Council at the time. ‘They are so stunning and spectacular that we can claim we have our very own ""Pompeii of the North"" right on our doorstep.’ A joint project to explore the site between the county council, Durham University, local enthusiasts and American university students, is now in its sixth year. Last year Alex Kirton, 20, from . Hertfordshire, discovered a carved sandstone head at Binchester, which . was believed to be a Roman god that was worshipped . locally. Archaeologists also discovered a bath house (pictured) with seven-foot high walls, once covered with brightly-painted designs. The experts have dubbed the finds the 'Pompeii of the north.' The bath house was found with the original floor, doorways and window openings . The site of Binchester Roman Fort is near Bishop Auckland in County Durham (marked). Binchester, which stands near the River Wear, was known to the Romans as Vinovia and commanded the main road that ran from the legionary headquarters at York north to Hadrian's Wall . Project coordinator, Dr David Petts, lecturer in archaeology at Durham University, said: ‘Our excavations have uncovered parts of one of the best preserved Roman buildings in Britain. ‘The building itself and the wonderful array of artefacts we have recovered from Binchester give us an unparalleled opportunity to better understand life on the northern frontier in the Roman period. ‘For example, the altar is a reminder that bath houses were about more than keeping clean and exercising and were actually social centres - a bit like our modern day leisure centres. Symbol of Christianity? The silver ring is inset with an intaglio, a carving into a flat surface. It appears to show two fish suspended from an anchor, at the time a symbol of Christianity. Archaeologists believe the ring is from the 3rd century AD. If it is a Christian symbol, it would the oldest Christian object in Britain . This ornate  coin is one of many found at the site and shows the technology the Romans brought to Britain . This piece of ceramics contains the image of a face and is thought to date back later than the 4th century AD . ‘The most unique feature of these remains is the sheer scale of their preservation. Lower and middle class Romans living in Pompeii feasted on exotic meats and spicy seafood in times before the city was struck by a devastating volcanic eruption in 79AD. Archaeologists recently disproved popular preconceptions that the rich dined on imported delicacies including flamingo, while the poor survived on gruel, by revealing that all classes of people enjoyed a rich and varied diet. The researchers discovered sea urchin and the butchered leg of a giraffe among less exotic foods like grain and eggs, in a poorer area of the ruined city. ‘It is possible to walk through a series of Roman rooms with walls all above head height; this is pretty exceptional for Roman Britain.’ The altar was inscribed by a retired trooper who served with a unit of the Spanish cavalry based at Binchester. The . trooper described his rank as ‘architectus’ and this is the only . example, outside of Rome, which shows architects were on the staff of . auxiliary cavalry units and not just the legions of the Emperor’s . personal protection unit, the Praetorian Guard. Binchester, . which stands near the River Wear, was known to the Romans as Vinovia . and commanded the main road that ran from the legionary headquarters at . York north to Hadrian’s Wall. It . formed a key element of the complex frontier system that lay both sides . of the Wall which marked the northern-most edge of the Roman Empire for . nearly 400 years. Elsewhere on the site, an inscribed altar (pictured left) dedicated to the Roman Goddess Fortune the Home-bringer (illustration pictured right), was also unearthed. The altar has been inscribed by a retired trooper who served with a unit of the Spanish cavalry based at Binchester who described his rank as 'architectus' This stone fragment from the fort still bares the paint used to decorate the walls of rooms inside the building . This image shows the bath house from above. The altar found on the site reveals that bath houses were about more than keeping clean and exercising, and were actually social centres - a bit like modern-day leisure centres . Archaeologists have also found a number of items made out of bronze, copper and bone, such as this pin . The findings are so preserved and significant, principal archaeologist Dr David Mason said: '[They] present a graphic illustration of life under the Roman Empire. They are so stunning we can claim we have our very own ""Pompeii of the north"" right on our doorstep.'

"Tragedy struck in the Cape Cod town of Hyannis on Monday when an 8-year-old boy perished in a raging shed fire near his home. Savvas Yianasmidis was with two other boys, both 8, when some friendly fun turned into a dangerous bet: $100 to set some paper on fire. When the fire began to burn too hot, one of the boys kicked what he thought was a can of water onto the blaze--only it turned out to be gasoline. Horrific: A boy was tragically killed in a shed fire Monday in what authorities have characterized as a terrible accident that befell three 8-year-olds . Tragedy: 8-year-old Savvas Yianasmidis died Monday in the blaze, which started as he and two others were playing with a lighter . Authorities say one of the children was playing with a lighter. Cape and Islands District Attorney Michael O’Keefe Savvas was in the shed playing on a laptop with the two friends. The boy who kicked the can of gasoline told CBS Boston that he and the other surviving boy leaped over the growing flames, but Yianasmidis was too afraid. Authorities received a call at about 5:30 p.m. and by the time firefighters arrived the 8-foot-by-12-foot shed was engulfed.

"A Costco employee allegedly kicked and broke a customer's leg at the store's exit. Customer Timothy Walls alleges in his $670,000 lawsuit two Portland employees were involved in the altercation, The Oregonian reported.

"A 'price list' for Yazidi and Christian women and child slaves abducted by ISIS militants as spoils of war has been unveiled. The terror organisation recently boasted of enslaving women from the Iraqi ethnic minority. According to the document, obtained by website Iraqinews.com, just £27 will fetch a Yazidi or Christian woman aged between 40 and 50. Chillingly, a child between one and nine will fetch four times that. The document also states that the slavery market has recently taken a downturn, hitting ISIS' war chest. Scroll down for video . Disturbing: A 'price list' for Yazidi and Christian women and child slaves abducted by ISIS militants as spoils of war has been unveiled. Pictured, an Islamic State fighter explaining it is slave 'distribution day' in a video . 'We should have our share': ISIS have said captured Yazidi women are divided 'according to Sharia law' It said: 'The market to sell women and spoils of war has been experiencing a significant decrease, which has adversely affected ISIS revenue and financing of the Mujahideen.' ISIS has now imposed price controls over the sale of women and spoils, threatening to execute whoever violates the guidelines. According to the document, no one is allowed to purchase more than three slaves, unless they are foreigners like Turks, Syrians and Gulf Arabs. One unidentified man, pictured left, says he is searching for a girl while another man sitting next to him laughs . Who wants to sell? A man asks who has a slave to sell and one is quickly found and negotiations begin . Exchange: The seller quickly reveals he is happy to part with his young slave girl for a Glock pistol . Haggle: But the buyers want to know what the girl looks like before they name a price . Yesterday an unsettling video emerged purporting to show Islamic State fighters bartering over Yazidi women at a slave girl 'market', with men appearing in the clip explain it is 'slave market day'. The footage shows the men negotiating the price of the women, with blue and green-eyed young girls fetching a higher price. It starts with one man saying to the camera: 'Today is the slave market day. Today is the day where this verse applies: 'Except with their wives and the (captives) whom their right hands possess, - for (then) they are not to be blamed'. A woman aged 40 to 50 - 50,000 dinars (£27) A woman aged 30 to 40 - 75,000 dinars (£40) A woman aged 20 to 30 - 100,000 dinars (£53) A girl, aged 10 to 20  - 150,000 dinars (£80) A child under nine - 200,000 dinars (£106) He added: 'Today is distribution day God willing. Each one takes his share.' Another then says: 'I swear man I am searching for a girl. I hope I find one.' The men laugh and another says: 'Today is the day of (female) slaves and we should have our share.' Bartering begins after a seller is found, who says he is happy to sell his slave for a Glock pistol. Sellers offer prices, with one going as high as five banknotes. Subtitles on the clip explain that one banknote is probably the equivalent of 100 dollars. But the buyers explain the price they are willing to pay depends on looks and they will need to verify the girl is to their liking. One says he would need to check the teeth of the 15-year-old being auctioned, and explains: 'If she doesn't have teeth, why would I want her?' The video was shot in Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, which was seized by ISIS in June, according to Al Aan TV - which translated the clip into English. Barter: The men begin to negotiate a price with the seller, with some offering money and one offering a gun . Picky: But the buyers explain the price depends on the young girl's looks and they will need to check her teeth . The group has been reported as saying that Yazidi women and children captured during the offensive in Sinjar town were divided among fighters 'according to sharia law'. Last month, a young Yazidi woman forced into sex slavery by the Islamic State claimed militants raped her 30 times in just a few hours. The unidentified woman is understood to have been kept as a prisoner of the jihadists somewhere in western Iraq having been captured by ISIS during the Sinjar massacre in early August. A group raising awareness of ISIS' persecution of women in the vast swathes of the Middle East under its control said the woman had contacted Kurdish peshmerga fighters by telephone to plead for the brothel to be bombed to put the women held as sex slaves out of their misery. She allegedly told the fighters she had been raped so frequently that she could no longer use the toilet, adding the ordeal has been so harrowing that she plans to commit suicide even if freed. Valuable: Blue and green eyes are preferred by the men, who say they will offer a higher price . The men offer money in terms of banknotes, which an English translation says is around 100 dollars . Teeth: But negotiations later stall when it appears the girl, thought to be aged 15, may be missing some teeth . And a 15-year-old girl told how she escaped militants by drugging and shooting two husbands who bought her as a slave. The teenager, who has been kept anonymous to protect her family, was one of hundreds of women from the Yazidi sect who extremists kidnapped after overrunning their homes on Iraq's Mount Sinjar. The UN have confirmed that thousands of Yazidis were slaughtered when ISIS swept through northern Iraq in August. Researchers concluded that more than 5,000 Yazidi were gunned down in a series of massacres by jihadists. Thousands of women are also being held in makeshift detention centres, where they either been taken away and sold into slavery or handed over to jihadists as concubines. The clip begins with one man addressing the camera: Today is the slave market day. Today is the day where this verse applies: 'Except with their wives and the (captives) whom their right hands possess, - for (then) they are not too be blamed'. Today is distribution day God willing. Each one takes his share. Another then says: I swear man I am searching for a girl. I hope I find one. Another adds: Today is the day of (female) slaves and we should have our share. The bartering begins with the words: Who wants to sell? The seller's reply: I want to sell. Why? I pay three banknotes (Subtitles explain one banknote is probably 100 dollars) I buy her for a pistol. The price differs if she has blue eyes. The seller replies: I will sell her for a Glock! I pay five banknotes. It depends on how she looks like. If she is 15 years old, I have to check her... Check her teeth. If she has green eyes... If she doesn't have teeth, why would I want her?","An ISIS document outlining price of slaves in Iraq has emerged .

"A Marine who was left disfigured after fearlessly shielding a comrade from a grenade blast in Afghanistan will receive the Medal of Honor, it has emerged. Kyle Carpenter, 24, will reportedly be presented with the nation's top military award later this year, becoming only the third Marine from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to receive it. While no formal announcement has been made, officials told the Marine Corps Times that plans are being finalized for a ceremony in Washington later this year. Carpenter, from South Carolina, lost his right eye and most of the teeth in the November 2010 blast, which also shattered his jaw and broke his arm in dozens of places, leaving him heavily scarred. Scroll down for video . Hero: Corporal Carpenter is to receive the Medal of Honor for throwing himself on a grenade to save a friend . He was just 21 when he intentionally threw his body over a grenade to save his friend, Lance Cpl. Nicholas Eufrazio, while they stood guard on a rooftop in the Helmand province. Eufrazio survived the attack but the frontal lobe of his brain was seriously injured by shrapnel and it took him more than two years to be able to talk again. After the blast, Carpenter underwent more than 30 surgeries and has been fitted with a glass eye. Speaking to the Times, Carpenter said he had been in Afghanistan for five months before the blast. 'We . knew the area we were moving into was one of the rougher areas,' he . said. Discover more about Kyle's recovery at Still in the Fight . Comrades: Carpenter, pictured left in Afghanistan, threw himself on the grenade to protect Lance Cpl. Nicholas Eufrazio, right, in November 2010. Both men survived but suffered serious injuries . Brave: Corporal Carpenter, from South Carolina, had been in Afghanistan for 5 months before the explosion . Kyle Carpenter will be only the third Marine to receive the Medal of Honor since the start of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. In 2007, Corporal Jason Dunham was awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously for covering a grenade with his body during an attack in Iraq in 2004. He was mortally wounded but saved the lived of at least two fellow Marines. In 2011, Dakota Meyer became the first Marine Medal of Honor recipient out of the war in Afghanistan. In 2009, he had ignored orders to stay put and fought his way into an ambush to help rescue three dozen Afghan and American troops and to recover four dead Americans. Carpenter will become the youngest living Medal of Honor recipient when he is awarded; currently, the title is held by Meyer, who is 25. He said that he refused to be bitter . about his injuries, adding: 'I'm still here and kicking, and I have all . my limbs, so you'll . never hear me complain.' There . has been some debate over exactly what happened before the explosion, . as Carpenter said he was unable to remember what had happened and there . were no witnesses to the event. But troops have said they have no doubt Carpenter had acted to save his friends life. Hospitalman . 3rd Class Christopher Frend, who was the first to treat the men, said . the injuries were consistent with Carpenter covering the grenade. He added that the part of the grenade that detonated was found beneath Carpenter's torso. 'Grenade . blasts blow up; they don't blow down,' Frend told Marine Corps Times in . 2012. 'If he hadn't done it, what we found would have looked completely . different.' Even though he has since left the Marines, Carpenter has maintained close ties with them and has been featured as a guest of honor at several command events. On the anniversary of the blast last year, he wrote on Facebook to thank his supporters. 'It's hard to comprehend that three . years ago today my life and body was torn apart by an enemy hand grenade . on a hot dusty rooftop in Afghanistan,' he wrote. Fighter: Corporal Carpenter, 24, lost his right eye and most of his teeth in the blast. He also suffered a shattered jaw . Still smiling: He has undergone 30 surgeries, including on his right arm which broke in numerous places . 'At . times it has felt so long ago and yet, when I close my eyes, I can . still feel the warm blood pouring out of me onto my skin and fading out . of consciousness with my the final thought of ""I'm going to die"" in my . head... And here I am.' The . Marine Corps Times said that it made inquiries into his receiving the . Medal of Honor because a formal recommendation for the award must be . made within three years of the combat action. The . Marine has also been celebrated as a hero across the nation - appearing . on Katie Couric's show to talk about his experiences, and garnering . thousands of fans on his Facebook page.

"Blood-thirsty bed bugs are set to sweep the UK in the coming weeks as forecasters predict a 'perfect storm' of a wet and mild winter. The conditions will provide an ideal breeding environment for the creatures, which are capable of surviving for a month without feeding as they wait for a human to arrive. And experts have warned people who were away on their summer holidays could have unwittingly brought more bed bugs back in suitcases and travel bags. Bloodthirsty bedbugs are set to sweep the UK in the coming weeks with forecasters predicting a 'perfect storm' of wet and mild winter. The conditions will provide ideal breeding environment for the creatures . 'People often associate an increase in the number of bedbugs with the warm weather, but it is far more likely to be caused by trips abroad or even hotel stays in this country,' said Rob Simpson, managing director of pest controllers register Basis Prompt told the Express. 'Families can bring them home in luggage or clothing and would never suspect a thing. The first time they know about it is when they wake up with a rash which can be itchy for days.' Bedbugs, which feast on blood and leave irritating bite marks, have become far more common over the last decade. Earlier this year, genetic tests revealed that a single undetected pregnant bed bug is all it takes to start an entire infestation. Bedbugs, which feast on blood and leave irritating bite marks, have become far more common over the last decade or so. Their recent resurgence has been blamed by some experts on resistance to commonly used insecticides and the increase in international travel . Snuggling into freshly laundered bed linen is one of life’s little pleasures. But it seems only a fastidious few enjoy it as a weekly routine. As a bed bug invasion is set to sweep the UK, a survey has revealed 35 per cent of adults only change their bed linen once a fortnight. Just over a third made sure to wash their sheets once a week. And one in ten, identified in the poll as ‘au naturels’, confessed they didn’t bother to throw their linen in the washing machine more than once a month. This is equivalent to some five million adults nationwide. Asked by pollsters YouGov when they considered unwashed sheets to become unhygienic, half of those polled said between two and three weeks. As to when they became ‘disgusting’, women said five weeks on average, while men said six. The older we get the more fussy we are about clean linen. Among 18 to 24-year-olds, 37 per cent said they were ‘au naturels’ and only 16 per cent were weekly washers. But among the over-60s, 42 per cent laundered sheets every week and only 14 per cent left their bedding for more than three weeks without a wash. A DNA study at Sheffield University showed that colonies of bed bugs come from a common ancestor or a few of female bed bugs. The pregnant bed bug could rapidly create a colony of thousands of offspring that feed on humans. Bed bugs' ability to generate a new colony from such small numbers might be a 'clue to their recent success'. In the late 1880s, an estimated 75 per cent of households were affected, but by the outbreak of World War II, that figure had dwindled to 25 per cent. Their recent resurgence has been blamed by some experts on resistance to commonly used insecticides and the increase in international travel. Bed bugs spread on clothes, bags and in furniture when it is moved - 'anywhere that people exist, particularly where they sit or lie down', according to bed-bug extermination expert David Cain. They are wingless, rust coloured insects about the size of an apple pip. During the day they lurk in the seams of mattresses, cracks in furniture, behind skirting boards and in crevices in the walls - coming out at night to feed on your blood. They go for exposed areas of the body such as the legs and arms - they don't tend to bother burrowing through clothing. Genetic tests revealed that a single undetected pregnant bed bug is all it takes to start an entire infestation . When they bite, bed bugs inject tiny amounts of blood thinning and anaesthetic agents into their victim, triggering an immune response in humans. In most cases, and if they are left alone, the bites calm down and disappear over the course of a week to ten days. However, in some cases the person bitten has a bulbous reaction to the bite - this is when the skin erupts into pus-filled blisters. While bed bugs are not known to carry diseases, doctors say there is still a question over whether they can transmit hepatitis B or C, although there are no proven cases. But almost more profound than the physical reaction is the psychological one. 'Some people get completely traumatised and go off the deep end, throwing out furniture and fumigating everything, but others deal with it very well,' said Mr Cain. The problem is that victims think it's related to hygiene so it's a stigma. They're terrified to think their house is dirty or that they've introduced something that has caused their family damage.' In fact, bed bugs do not choose a dirty home over a clean one - all they are interested in is your blood. When they bite, bed bugs inject tiny amounts of blood thinning  agents into their victim, triggering an immune response in humans. In most cases,  the bites calm down and disappear within 10 days .","Forecasters are predicting a 'perfect storm' of wet and mild winter .

"A former American Idol contestant forced to crowdsource funds so she can have life-saving brain surgery says it is staying in her small home town, and not moving to Los Angeles, that is saving her life. Heather Cox Coe, of Elkin, North Carolina, was a Top 20 finalist on the fifth season of American Idol, and while public support couldn't get her to the final 12 of the popular reality show, the small town support she is getting now is saving her life, as she has already raised the $30,000 initial payment for her surgery. And it's not just money that is helping the married mother of three get by these days. Scroll down for videos . Most important role: Heather Cox Coe (above with husband Curtis and her three children) is hoping to crowdsource $100,000 so she can have brain surgery . Not going to Hollywood: Miss Coe was a Top 20 finalist on the fifth season of Idol (above), but says her decision to stay in her small own rather than move to L.A. and pursue her career has saved her life . 'Having the community’s support as well as my church family has been one of the ways I’ve been able to stay strong through this,' the 31-year-old told the Elkin Tribune. 'With a small town, someone is always there to give you a hug, tell you they’re praying for you, as well as cook you a meal if needed. Big cities may offer more to do, but my small town has literally been a life saver.' Miss Coe revealed that back in her Idol days, host Ryan Seacrest urged her to move to Los Angeles to pursue her music career, something she is now grateful she never followed through on, preferring to go back to her small town because 'the sense of community is so much greater.' She was diagnosed with having a pineal gland tumor in the center of her brain in 2010, which doctors initially said could only be removed by way of a dangerous craniotomy. Even with this surgery however, there was still a chance she could end up with brain damage or even dead. Miss Coe has since found another doctor who will perform a less invasive surgery, which is good news for the mom whose three children, Lucius, 5, Jayden, 2, and 1-year-old Kaylen, are the biggest reason she keeps fighting. “One of the most difficult thoughts that I have to battle is the thought of my three precious babies growing up without their mommy here,” she said. Famous friends: Miss Coe (above with Ryan Seacrest) got some support from fellow Idol alums Kellie Pickler, Mandisa, and Chris Daughtry, who all publicized her cause . After reaching her first goal two days ago, no doubt thanks to some support from a few of her big name Idol pals like Kellie Pickler, Mandisa, and Chris Daughtry, who all publicized her efforts to raise money, Miss Coe thanked everyone on her GoFundMe page. 'THIS IS A HUGE THANK YOU to family, friends, anonymous donors, and to total strangers who felt it in your heart to give; you are all AMAZING and my heart continues to cry THANK YOU!!!!' she wrote. Her ultimate goal is to raise $100,000. Miss Coe also says she is getting some major support from her husband, Curtis. 'The Lord has blessed me with a wonderful husband, Curtis, and he has been such a pillar of strength for me when I’ve needed it most, and we’ve birthed three beautiful children that have literally given me a reason to live,' she said.

"She's often declared her intention to be seen as more than a political wife in a pretty dress but that hasn't prevented Justine Miliband from upping her style game in recent years. Indeed, Mrs Miliband's most recent appearance in Manchester saw her cut a stylish figure as she took to the stage, resplendent in a trendy £59.99 cerise dress from high street favourite, Zara. True to her independent style, the 44-year-old's new look is all her own work, with Labour sources keen to point out that she chooses all her own clothes and has resisted calls to get a stylist. Scroll down for video . Looking good: Justine Miliband was pretty in a £59.99 cerise dress from Zara as she arrived at Conference . Not, it seems, that she needs it, for gone are the dated, unflattering frocks of four years ago and in their place, a wardrobe of neat, tailored shift dresses that wouldn't look out of place on the Duchess of Cambridge. But while they might look expensive, much of Mrs Miliband's wardrobe comes from carefully chosen high street brands, with Zara and Topshop bulking out a smattering of designer names. Yesterday saw her take to the stage to defend her 'principled' husband in a chic emerald green silk shirt and the sort of flattering cropped trousers regularly spotted on Samantha Cameron. Other highlights of her sartorial career so far include the chic £245 Bassey Jacquard dress and nude L.K Bennett 'Sledge' shoes worn to last year's Labour conference in Brighton and the stylish geometric-print cigarette pants worn to cast her vote at Doncaster Town Hall in May.

Equally well-received was the punchy crimson dress by Scottish eco-designer Henrietta Ludgate worn by Mrs Miliband during Labour's 2012 Manchester conference. Arguably though, it was her stunning Alice Temperley wedding gown that truly propelled her onto the style scene after years of unflattering black. Not that she's immune to the odd slip-up, as the Cherie Blair style salwar kameez worn to the Asian Women of Achievement Awards in June made plain. But, like fellow political WAG (and reluctant leader's wife), Miriam Clegg, Mrs Milliband has developed a punchy style that rarely looks dated and is always appropriate. She might want to be seen as 'more than just a dress' but the environmental lawyer is doing an excellent job of ensuring her glamorous looks are as talked about as her husband's speeches - and usually far more positively.

"With an annual passenger load that rivals the population of a large country, the world’s busiest airport isn’t found in New York, London, Tokyo or Beijing. The location may surprise you even though it has had a stranglehold on the title for nearly two decades. For the 16th consecutive year, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in the US state of Georgia has been crowned the most heavily used airport in the world. Scroll down for video . Busiest in the world: 94.4 million travellers passed through Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport . According to data released by Airports Council International (ACI), 94.4 million travellers passed through the suburban Atlanta airport in 2013, down 1.1 per cent from 2012. It is consistently the busiest in the world because it is a major hub for domestic flights and routes to Europe and South America. Beijing Capital International Airport was the second busiest in the world with 83.7 million passengers, an increase of 2.2 per cent compared with the previous year. In third place was London Heathrow Airport, which saw its passenger totals increase 3.3 per cent to 72.4 million. Third place: London Heathrow Airport saw its passenger totals increase 3.3 per cent to 72.4 million . London remained the world’s largest airport system with almost 140 million passengers handled at six airports, and Heathrow had the most international passengers (67.3 million). Rounding out the top five were Tokyo International Airport (Haneda) and Chicago O’Hare International Airport. The top 10 was largely unchanged, although the rankings signal Dubai’s emergence as one of the fastest growing airports in the world. Dubai International Airport climbed from tenth to seventh place with 66.4 million passengers, a year-to-year increase of 15 per cent.

"Intelligence services were last night trying to  trace an NHS doctor who was part of a terror cell that kidnapped and shot a British photographer in Syria. The AK-47-wielding medic is part of an extremist gang that held veteran war photographer John Cantlie and a fellow western journalist hostage for a week. A heavily bearded Islamic fanatic, he told his prisoners he had taken a sabbatical from his NHS job to wage a ‘holy war’  in Syria. Captive: John Cantlie, who was shot in the arm when he tried to escape the camp in Syria, said his British-born captor planned to return to a role in the NHS . He also told them that he was planning to return to his senior post in a South London A&E department. Last night the General Medical Council said it would be investigating Mr  Cantlie’s account. A spokesman said: ‘Protecting patients is our priority. We are looking very closely at these allegations.’ Mr Cantlie, 41, was captured last . month with Dutch colleague Jeroen Oerlemans while they were covering the . civil war between President Assad’s army and rebel fighters. As he tried to flee in a botched . escape attempt, Mr Cantlie was shot in the arm but was later treated by . the doctor, who was using a clearly labelled NHS medical kit. When asked his name, he told the captives: ‘Just call me the doctor – I’m the only one here.’ The medic, who said he was 28 and had . a wife and child in Britain, was also among the leaders of a group who . were planning to behead ‘spies’ and was furious when the execution of . two Syrians he believed to be undercover agents was halted. It comes just days after the . intelligence services warned that dozens of Britons, many thought to be . of Pakistani origin, were going to Syria to wage jihad, or holy war. The . concern is that they will return to the UK radicalised and pose a . security problem. Destruction: Mr Cantlie and a colleague were held captive at a camp two miles inside the border of Syria - the scene of deadly clashes between rebel fighters and President Assad's army . Mr Cantlie told the Daily Mail of his British captor: ‘When he told me he was an NHS doctor, I thought it was weird. ‘This is a man who has taken an oath . to save people and help them, and here he is walking around with a . Kalashnikov and preaching sharia law. There are not any doctors who I . know that do that. ‘He clearly believed in what he was . doing but to follow something to that extreme is the disturbing thing. He was visibly upset when the execution was called off.’ In a macabre twist, the doctor, who . spoke in a South London accent and kept his face covered with sunglasses . and a scarf – said he was glad of the experience in Syria as when he . returned to Britain . he wanted to specialise in trauma injuries. Mr Cantlie added: ‘He said treating . jihadists wounded in battle was good training and had a pack of gauzes, . medicine, IV drips and medical gear. ‘As he treated the gunshot wound in my arm, he clearly knew what he was doing. He was very well-trained.’ Mr Cantlie and his colleague were . captured when they went to a camp they had previously visited, unaware . that terrorists had since taken it over. He said of the doctor: ‘I asked for . his help as we were both from London but he refused to even send a text . to my girlfriend to say we were alive. He said he would be beheaded if . he did. ‘He said, “I can’t be in here too long because the other guys say I’m too nice to you”.’ The doctor, who is believed to be of . Pakistani descent, was among around 15 British nationals at the terror . camp, just inside Syria’s border, many of whom had London accents. They . were part of a  40-strong cell called Al Absi, which aims to convert . Syria to sharia law. Mr Cantlie, pictured, said he was still eager to return to Syria to report on the war despite his traumatic experience . When Mr Cantlie tried to escape on . the second of his seven days in captivity, one of those who opened fire . was British, wounding him in the elbow and his Dutch friend in the leg. He said: ‘Afterwards the doctor was the guy who treated us. ‘He stabilised Jeroen with saline . drips, that had NHS logos, gave him antibiotics and stitched his wound. His assistant, another Londoner, bandaged my wounds. This guy had shot . at me as we tried to escape. Mr Cantlie was captured last month with Dutch colleague Jeroen Oerlemans, pictured . 'He also smacked the butt of his AK-47 into . my head after we were recaptured. Some of the Brits were vindictive. They wanted us dead.’ He said that after this, the doctor . ‘came into the tent where I was handcuffed and blindfolded. The . militants had smacked me about as they claimed I was the leader of the . escape. ‘He said, “I’m very disappointed in . you, John. Before this you were going to be ransomed, but now I don’t . know. I told you to have patience, that it would be OK. Now it will be . bad”. ‘It wasn’t much fun expecting to end . up on an execution video at the hands of extremists – one of whom was . treating Londoners like me a few months ago.’ The next day, to Mr Cantlie’s horror, . he saw a trestle table being erected and heard knives being sharpened, . but later learned these were for two Syrians who were eventually spared . after repenting and promising to follow sharia law. He added: ‘The . doctor was annoyed. He said they should’ve been beheaded because they . were Syrian spies.’ Throughout his ordeal, Mr Cantlie was kept handcuffed in a tent. On one occasion he heard the doctor on the phone to his family. He added: ‘He was saying, “Hello . babes, how’s the little ‘un? Put him on and let me hear him”.’ At . another point, he even complained to his hostages about the state of the . NHS. ‘He told us the NHS is good if you’re . in a serious accident but if you’re on a hip replacement waiting list . it’s terrible,’ Mr Cantlie said. Unrest: Mr Cantlie and Mr Oerlemans were eventually rescued by Syrian rebels. Above, a member of the Free Syrian Army runs for cover during clashes with army soldiers in Aleppo's Saif al-Dawla district this week . Clashes: Fighting is ongoing in Syria as rebel fighters attempt to wrest control from President Assad's army. Smoke can be seen over the Salah al-Din in central Aleppo after clashes earlier this month . Both photographers eventually managed . to escape from the camp in Northern Syria with the help of the Free . Syrian Army, the rebels fighting Assad’s forces. Speaking yesterday, Mr Cantlie, who . has suffered nerve damage in his left arm and now has only limited . movement in his fingers, said he was still eager to return to Syria to . report on the war despite his traumatic experience. He said: ‘I am itching to get back out . there. The only thing stopping me is my cameras, as I lost them out . there and need to buy some more.’ Do you know the doctor?

"Budget airlines have been cleared to carry on imposing punishing baggage charges on passengers. A number of companies, such as Ryanair, have levied increasingly high fees in a policy to discourage travellers from bringing large bags that need to go in the hold. The ploy angers holidaymakers, but helps airlines cut their airport baggage handling fees and speeds up the turnaround of their aircraft. They also claim that the policy cuts fuel costs. Extra fee: The court's ruling is a big win for European budget airlines such as easyJet and Ryanair . It also allows budget airlines to keep headline fares down – which is the key to attracting customers in the first place. Europe’s . top court has now sided with them rather than travellers, following . legal action by a consumer body in Spain against the airline Vueling, a . sister brand of British Airways. The . case was triggered four years ago when a Spanish woman complained about . a 40 euro – £31.50 – charge for checked-in luggage on a trip between La . Coruna and Amsterdam. The . Galician Consumer’s Institution sided with her and fined Vueling . 3,000euro – £2,360 – on the basis Spanish law did not allow any baggage . surcharge. Vueling appealed . and the Spanish courts asked the European Court of Justice to decide on . the matter. Yesterday, the ECJ said charges to check baggage into the . hold were justified because of the extra costs this generates for an . airline. The EU's top court said a Spanish consumer court was wrong to fine Vueling Airlines for charging a fee . The news will be . welcomed by the likes of Ryanair which charges a fee to check a large . bag into the hold, rising to as much as £75 during peak periods such as . Christmas or the summer holidays. Ryanair . said: ‘We note the ruling and continue to abide fully with EU law. Just . 20 per cent of our customers travel with checked-in baggage, while all . Ryanair customers can bring two free bags on board.’ In . its ruling, the European Court said travellers could not assume that an . airline should be expected to carry their bags free of charge in the . hold as part of the package when buying a ticket. ‘Spanish law requiring . airlines to carry checked-in baggage without a surcharge infringes EU . law,’ it said. ‘The . processing and storing of checked-in baggage is likely to lead to . additional costs for the airline, which is not the case for carrying . hand baggage. The EU court said a Spanish consumer court was wrong to fine Vueling Airlines after a passenger complained . ‘Furthermore, . the extent of the liability of the carrier for damage to baggage is . greater when baggage is checked in than when it is not. ‘The . price to be paid for the transportation of checked baggage of . passengers can be an optional extra cost. Such a service cannot be . considered mandatory or essential for the transport of such passengers. ‘It . is not inconceivable that some passengers prefer to travel without . checked baggage, provided that reduces the price of your ticket.’ The . ruling should not affect major carriers such as British Airways or . Virgin Atlantic because carrying hold luggage is included in their . ticket prices.","Court said checked-in baggage is not considered 'compulsory or necessary’

"He’s famed for being one of the greatest living singer songwriters and now Sir Paul McCartney has turned his hand to rapping.

"From her show-stopping wedding gown and the dazzling dresses she wore as she adapted to her role as a royal, to her chic maternity choices while pregnant, the Duchess of Cambridge was the world's favourite style icon. But it seems that we've had a change of heart as Cheryl Versini-Fernandez, who has been showcasing her wardrobe choices week after week on the X Factor, has pipped Kate to be crowned the most stylish woman. In fact, the Duchess, who recently announced she is pregnant with her second child, is nowhere to be seen on the latest best dressed list. Britain's new style icon: Cheryl Versini-Fernandez, who has been showcasing her wardrobe choices week after week on the X Factor, has been crowned Britain's most stylish woman . Coming in at a close second after the X-Factor judge is Jennifer Aniston, as the nation celebrates the 20th anniversary of Friends this month and the legacy of that haircut lives on. The sophisticated style of Helen Mirren and Yasmin Le Bon has also struck a chord with women up and down the country, as has Victoria Beckham’s elegant look, ahead of her flagship store opening in London this week. Other females to make the top ten includes Kelly Brook,  Alexa Chung and even Kate's sister, Pippa Middleton. Victoria’s husband, the dapper David Beckham, is cited as the top style inspiration for men, pipping the likes of Harry Styles, Bradley Cooper and Pharrell Williams to the post. Contenders: Coming in at a close second after the X-Factor judge is Jennifer Aniston, left, and mature style poster girl Helen Mirren, right, came in third place . Despite eschewing catwalk looks, Britons still look to paparazzi photos, celebrity street style and TV talent for inspiration, with over a third  (37 per cent) admitting that they buy outfits to copy celebrity looks, setting them back an average of £77 per outfit. Perhaps a result of our celebrity-obsessed culture, young people are the most likely to emulate celebrities with over half of 25-35 year olds (52 per cent) confessing to buying outfits to recreate a look they’ve seen on a famous face. With the sun on its way out, and autumn on its way in, the fashion conscious will no doubt be looking to stock their winter wardrobes, with the average Briton set to splash £241 on clothes to keep out the cold. Lost her touch?

Retailers will be celebrating the colder climes as 71 per cent of the UK are set to buy a new coat this winter, while 80 per cent will stock up on jumpers, and 66 per cent will treat themselves to a new pair of boots. This compares to just over £100 spent on clothes for the spring/summer months. Despite the reported rise of the metrosexual male, women still reign supreme on the high street, admitting to spending an average of £430 a year on new clothes and accessories just to stay up to date with the latest trends, compared to just £295 spent by men. When it comes to dressing their children, ten per cent of Brits are also looking to celebrity children for inspiration perhaps emulating the fashions of ultra-trendy Harper Beckham, Prince George and North ‘Nori’ West. Family style: David Beckham topped the best dressed men's list whilst daughter Harper Seven is inspiring ten per cent of Brits looking to celebrity children for inspiration . Almost half parents aged 18-24 (45 per cent) have looked to celebrity children, whilst almost a third (31 per cent) have sacrificed their own fashion so their children can stay on trend.

"A much-loved one-eyed bear will replace last year's Simon the Ogre in a new advert for Thomson as part of its 'Discover Your Smile' campaign. The ad tells the story of a much-loved bear called Miles who has been ground down by everyday life and is stuck in a routine. Miles is noticeably missing a smile as he’s stuffed into a bag by his owner and arrives at a Thomson resort in Jamaica where gradually his smile is restored. Is this the real life? 'Miles' changes from a bedraggled teddy in a humdrum existence to a bear with a smile . Is it just fantasy? Taken everywhere by his loving owner, the bear starts to enjoy his holiday as soon they arrive . Set to William Shatner’s tongue-in-cheek version of Queen's iconic Bohemian Rhapsody, the 60 second film will debut on TV during ITV’s X Factor this Saturday and will also be shown in cinemas across the country from Friday. The advert has the same 'feelgood factor' as last Christmas' hugely popular John Lewis advert featuring a bear and a hare, with the full version of Thomson's ad showing the bear in a toy's own version of a holiday romance. Little highs, little lows: The bear's frenetic urban existence is a far cry from the holiday he is about to go on . 'The new campaign builds on the success of the award-winning Simon the Ogre, which introduced the premise that a Thomson holiday has the power to transform you back to the best version of yourself,' said Jeremy Ellis, marketing and digital director at Thomson. 'The story of Miles the Bear brings that sentiment to life, powerfully introducing Discover Your Smile.' No escape from reality: The William Shatner cover of Queen's classic ballad fits the story well . Because I'm easy come, easy go: The bear's life is about to change as he's stuffed into a bag to take away . The one-eyed bear replaces last year's successful 'Simon The Ogre' advert by the same creative team at BMB . All smiles: Miles will go on sale before Christmas . Miles the bear will soon be able for purchase in Thomson retail stores, with a percentage of the proceeds going to the Family Holiday Association, a charity which provides short breaks in the UK for children and their families who suffer from hardship.

"The mother of Steven Sotloff, the US journalist identified as the next hostage to be executed by ISIS, has today desperately begged her son's violent captors to release him in a heart-wrenching appeal that was aired on an Arabian  television network. Shirley Sotloff directed her message to the leader of ISIS and the self-professed caliph of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, controversially acknowledging his authority despite the fact many in the Muslim world do not. 'My son is in your hands,' Ms Sotloff said. 'As a mother I ask Your Justice to be merciful and not punish my son for matters he has no control over. I ask you to use your authority to spare his life.' Scroll down for video . Release him: Steven Sotloff's mother, Shirley Sotloff, took matters into her own hands today, begging for his captors to spare him . Leader: Ms Sotloff directed her message to the leader of ISIS and the self-professed caliph of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, pictured . ISIS threatened to kill Mr Sotloff in a video uploaded on YouTube last week showing the beheading of his cellmate, and fellow journalist, James Foley. They said they would only spare his life if the American government stopped its air strikes on Iraq. Until that point, the Sotloff family have taken great pains not to publicize their son's case under strict instruction from the terror cell. But after the grisly footage, which showed the 31-year-old paraded by Foley's executioner, was released his mother chose to make a last ditch attempt to appeal to the group for mercy. Grim: ISIS, the terror group that murdered James Foley, has already threatened to kill Steven Sotloff, pictured left and right, if the US government doesn't cave to its demands . Next: ISIS said in a video uploaded to YouTube showing his cellmate, James Foley's death, that the 31-year-old would be the next hostage to be executed . I'm sending this message to you Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi al-Qurashi al-Hussein, the caliph of the Islamic state. I am Shirley Sotloff. My son is in your hands. Steven is a journalist who traveled to the Middle East to cover the suffering of Muslims at the hands of tyrants. Steven is a loyal and generous son, brother and grandson. He's an honorable man and he's always tried to help the weak. We have not seen Steven for over a year and we miss him very much. We want to see him home safe and sound and to hug him. Since Steven's capture I have learned a lot about Islam. I have learned that Islam teaches that no individual should be held responsible for the sins of others. Steven has no control over the actions of the US government. He's an innocent journalist. I have always learned that you, the caliph, can grant amnesty. I ask you to please release my child. As a mother I ask Your Justice to be merciful and not punish my son for matters he has no control over. I ask you to use your authority to spare his life, to follow the example set by the Prophet Mohammed, who protected people of the book. I want what every mother wants, to live to see her children's children. I plead with you to grant me this. Ms Sotloff said in the statement that in the past year she has learned a lot about Islam, particularly that 'no individual should be held responsible for the sins of others.' 'Steven is a loyal and generous son, brother and grandson. He's an honorable man and he's always tried to help the weak,' she said. 'Steven has no control over the actions of the US government. He's an innocent journalist. I have always learned that you, the caliph, can grant amnesty. I ask you to please release my child.' 'I ask you to use your authority to spare his life, to follow the example set by the Prophet Mohammed, who protected people of the book.' Concluding, she said: 'I want what every mother wants - to live to see their children's children. I plead with you to grant me this.' According to the New York Times, in the year since Mr Sotloff went missing in Syria, his mother had asked news organizations to abide by a complete blackout on his disappearance. This was because ISIS had threatened to kill her son if she publicized his case. However, it was his captors themselves who identified Mr Sotloff when they declared him the next hostage to be executed. Chilling footage of the Miami-based freelance journalist shows him paraded in front of the camera and held by the collar of his shirt as a masked operative warned: 'The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.' The video was the first time his parents, Arthur and Shirley, had heard about Steve since December, according to the hostage's long-time friend Emerson Lotzia. ISIS terrorists holding the journalist had allowed him to contact his parents, although the details of their communication are unknown. 'They had no idea if he was dead or alive until they saw that footage. It was a mixed bag of emotions for his family, Lotzia said. 'On one hand they knew he was alive. But now they can see what he's going through. It's every parent's worst nightmare.' Free: The mother's impassioned plea came just minutes after Curtis, pictured Wednesday, who was released from captivity in Syria on Sunday . Lotzia revealed that he had spoken to Sotloff's father after the video's release, and he admitted he felt better before the tape was released than afterwards. The Times reports that, in referring to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as 'the caliph of the Islamic State,' Ms Sotloff is the first non-Muslim to acknowledge his authority, which may be controversial. The mother's impassioned plea came just minutes after fellow journalist Peter Theo Curtis, who was released from captivity in Syria on Sunday, praised the 'kindness' of the American people as he spoke to the world this morning for the first time since his release. During a brief news conference outside his mother's Cambridge, Massachusetts home, Curtis said he had 'no idea' how much effort had gone into securing his freedom from the Nusra Front, the a Sunni extremist group group that held him for 22 months. 'In the days following my release, I have learned bit by bit that there have been hundreds of people, brave determined and big-hearted people all over the world working for my release,' he told reporters, clearly thrilled to be back on U.S. soil. 'They've been working for two years on this.' 'I had no idea when I was in prison. I had no idea that so much effort was being expended on my behalf and since I've found out I am overwhelmed by emotion.'","ISIS, the terror group that murdered James Foley, has already threatened to kill Steven Sotloff if the US government doesn't cave to its demands .

The 40-year-old said: 'Both of those image types are achieved by turning the zoom ring on the lens during the exposure. 'The exploding photos are done with a 30 second exposure with a fast zoom, and the spirals are taken over a few hours with a very slow zoom. 'I set up the camera and use a programmable remote to automate the shoot. 'I usually take between 600 and 1,200 x 40 second exposures, which are later stacked using Photoshop.

"A squirrel poses proudly with a perfectly-formed snowball while another makes sure to capture the moment... by taking a photo. The pair of red squirrels were happy to play model and photographer - before the one behind the camera got fed up and wanted a turn at posing. The playful exchange is picture perfect, with the snow falling lightly as the squirrels play around with their new toys. The two red squirrels frolic about in the snow, and one decides to film their friend with a giant snowball . Photographer Vadim Trunov, 30, captured the courting pair in the woods in Voronezh, Russia, where he lives. He said: 'I took the photographs in the woods near the town, the squirrels were not skittish and are not afraid of people as they live so close to humans. 'I fed them nuts, which they happily took from me and hid in the snow, they kept taking nuts from me and then hiding them. 'Squirrels love to hide nuts, then find them again when they are hungry so they can eat. 'I decided to make a snowball with a nut inside and then left it on the ground. But the 'photographer' gets bored of capturing the action, and decides to get involved in the scene; and right, the squirrel's became interested as a nut was place in the middle of the snowball . 'A squirrel ran up, grabbed the snowball and picked it up. Perhaps she sensed the nut inside. 'Then it happened again with the second snowball I made so I decided to try and do a series of shots about a squirrel photographing another squirrel holding the snowball.' Mr Trunov, who was only four metres away from the pair, set up a camera on a tripod and made another snowball with nuts inside for the squirrels so he could snap the adorable snowy scene. The adorable scene was shot by photographer Vadim Trunov, 30, in the woods in Voronezh, Russia . He said: 'A squirrel ran up to the camera almost straight away and began to sniff it. 'A second squirrel grabbed a snowball and picked it up, again, probably to feel if there was a nut in it. 'She dropped it and picked it up again and it looked like she was posing for the camera. The squirrel to the left stands upright and gives its best side for the camera, dictated to by its partner in crime . 'Then the first squirrel climbed onto the camera, reached for its friend and grabbed her snowball. 'It was a nice moment and to capture it with the two squirrels simultaneously I made more than ten snowballs. 'Squirrels are very playful and curious animals, and I was happy to photograph this moment.'","Vadim Trunov, 30, photographed the pair of red squirrels in the woods in Voronezh, Russia .

Rampant poaching and loss of habitat due to human encroachment are cited as the major challenges to tiger conservation efforts.","Man killed by white tiger after jumping into enclosure at New Delhi Zoo .

"With his speech in front of the United Nations today, Leonardo DiCaprio cemented his reputation as one of the world's highest-profile activists on climate change. 'You can make history ...or be vilified by it,' he dramatically told world leaders. After marching with 400,000 others on the streets of New York this weekend to demand tough regulations to cut the amount of CO2 being pumped into the air, DiCaprio opened a UN climate change summit by urging the world to crack down on polluters and 'put a price tag on carbon emissions.' But the 39-year-old Hollywood star's own jetset lifestyle reveals a double-standard on the issue of climate change. In his speech to the UN, he said: 'This disaster has grown beyond the choices that individuals make.' MailOnline can report that DiCaprio took at least 20 trips across the nation and around the world this year alone - including numerous flights from New York to Los Angeles and back, a ski vacation to the French Alps, another vacation to the French Riviera, flights to London and Tokoyo to promote his film Wolf of Wall Street, two trips to Miami and trip to Brazil to watch the World Cup. Scroll down for video . Jetset lifestyle: Leonardo DiCaprio is seen here getting off his private jet in Nice, France, in May - one of the nearly two dozen trips he took this year . Leader: DiCaprio has fashioned himself as one of the most high-profile climate change activists an today urged world leaders at the United Nations to cut global carbon admissions . Activist: DiCaprio participated in the 'People's Climate March' in New York this weekend, but refused to answer questions about how his own lifestyle impacts the environment . And those were just the trips where he was spotted in public. Additionally, DiCaprio owns at least four homes: two apartments in New York and mansions in Hollywood and Palm Springs. He also recently sold an estate in Malibu for $17million. And this summer, he spent his World Cup vacation on the fifth largest yacht in the world, a 482-foot behemoth owned by Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan - a billionaire oil tycoon from the UAE. A rep for DiCaprio declined to comment for this story. DiCaprio has tried to stay green in other parts of his life. He owns a $4million apartment in an eco-friendly apartment building in Battery Park City. He drives a Toyota Prius and a $100,000 Fisker electric sports car.  He's been spotted riding a bike around New York. In 2007, he produced and narrated the 11th Hour, a documentary about climate change and other threats to the planet. He also represents several environmental charities and has thrown his star power behind Formula E, a new racing circuit that uses electric cars, instead of roaring gasoline-powered vehicles. However, his jetsetting - both for business and pleasure - means that he he's producing a lot more CO2 than most people. When PJTV reporter Michelle Fields confronted DiCaprio about his lifestyle, he refused to answer and Ms Fields was quickly pushed out of the way by a minder . Expensive toy: DiCaprio rented the Topaz, the fifth largest yacht in the world to sail around Brazil for his World Cup trip. It is owned by a UAE oil tycoon . DiCaprio, seen here in 2009, is known to fly in private jets on many of his trips . Despite flying around the world on private jets, DiCaprio has been spotted in New York - seen here in August - riding public Citi Bikes around town . Even if he flew on a commercial jet for all of flights, his carbon footprint so far in 2014 would be a minimum of 40million metric tons of CO2 spewed into the atmosphere, more than twice the average American output for an entire year. That figure only takes into account his flights and assumes that he flew exclusively on commercial airlines . The A-list star is worth an estimated $220million, according to CelebrityNetWorth.com, and it is known to frequently charter private jets. Carbon emissions for private jets vary, but by some accounts are more than 37 times higher than flying commercial. DiCaprio was the biggest star at this weekend's 'People's Climate March,' which drew 400,000 environmental activists to the streets of New York.

He also Forked over $10million to buy an apartment in the health-minded Delos building on Greenwich Village (right) On Tuesday, DiCaprio tweeted: 'Ran into this #climatechange pioneer at the @unitednations this morning. Thank you Vice President Gore.' He told a reporter from conservative PJTV media: 'We want to create 100percent clean energy, we need to make a transition in this country and we need to show leadership. 'And that's what we're doing.' However, when the reporter asked him about how his jetset lifestyle impacts the environment, she was quickly shunted away from the Wolf of Wall Street star by a minder. Today, he addressed the United Nations Climate Summit and told world leaders: 'My friends, this body - perhaps more than any other gathering in human history - now faces that difficult task. 'You can make history ...or be vilified by it.' He urged them: 'We need to put a pricetag on carbon emissions, and eliminate government subsidies for coal, gas, and oil companies. We need to end the free ride that industrial polluters have been given in the name of a free-market economy, they don't deserve our tax dollars, they deserve our scrutiny.' DiCaprio met UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon . Thank you, Mr. Secretary-General, your excellencies, ladies and gentleman, and distinguished guests. I’m honored to be here today, I stand before you not as an expert but as a concerned citizen, one of the 400,000 people who marched in the streets of New York on Sunday, and the billions of others around the world who want to solve our climate crisis. As an actor I pretend for a living. I play fictitious characters often solving fictitious problems. I believe humankind has looked at Climate Change in that same way: as if it were a fiction, happening to someone else’s planet, as if pretending that Climate Change wasn’t real would somehow make it go away. But I think we know better than that. Every week , we’re seeing new and undeniable Climate Events, evidence that accelerated Climate Change is here now. We know that droughts are intensifying, our oceans are warming and acidifying, with methane plumes rising up from beneath the ocean floor. We are seeing extreme weather events, increased temperatures, and the West Antarctic and Greenland ice-sheets melting at unprecedented rates, decades ahead of scientific projections. None of this is rhetoric, and none of it is hysteria. It is fact. The scientific community knows it, Industry and Governments know it, even the United States military knows it. The Chief of the U.S. Navy’s Pacific Command, Admiral Samuel Locklear, recently said that Climate Change is our single greatest security threat. My Friends, this body - perhaps more than any other gathering in human history - now faces that difficult task. You can make history...or be vilified by it. To be clear, this is not about just telling people to change their light bulbs or to buy a hybrid car. This disaster has grown BEYOND the choices that individuals make. This is now about our industries, and governments around the world taking decisive, large-scale action. I am not a scientist, but I don't need to be. Because the world’s scientific community has spoken, and they have given us our prognosis, if we do not act together, we will surely perish. Now is our moment for action . We need to put a pricetag on carbon emissions, and eliminate government subsidies for coal, gas, and oil companies. We need to end the free ride that industrial polluters have been given in the name of a free-market economy, they don't deserve our tax dollars, they deserve our scrutiny. For the economy itself will die if our eco-systems collapse. The good news is that renewable energy is not only achievable but good economic policy. New research shows that by 2050 clean, renewable energy could supply 100% of the world’s energy needs using EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES, and it would create millions of jobs. This is not a partisan debate; it is a human one. Clean air and water, and a livable climate are inalienable human rights. And solving this crisis is not a question of politics. It is our moral obligation - if, admittedly, a daunting one… . We only get one planet. Humankind must become accountable on a massive scale for the wanton destruction of our collective home. Protecting our future on this planet depends on the conscious evolution of our species. This is the most urgent of times, and the most urgent of messages. Honored delegates, leaders of the world, I pretend for a living. But you do not. The people made their voices heard on Sunday around the world and the momentum will not stop. And now it’s YOUR turn, the time to answer the greatest challenge of our existence on this planet... is now. I beg you to face it with courage. And honesty. Thank you.","Leonardo DiCaprio has positioned himself as one of the highest-profile climate change activists in the world .

"In the theatre of sporting combat, many teams are seen in triumph while wearing the colour red. Now a study has found that sportsmen with higher testosterone levels are more likely to choose that colour than any other. Daniel Farrelly, who led the study at the University of Sunderland, said choosing red ‘may unconsciously signal something about their competitive nature and it may well be something that affects how their opponents respond’. Men who choose to wear red when competing in sports have higher levels of testosterone than those who choose to wear blue - the Welsh Rugby team was wearing red when it won the Six Nations in 2013 . The study shows, he added, ‘that . there is something special about the colour red in competition, and that . it is associated with our underlying biological systems’. Some might add that the success of . teams in red – such as Manchester United in football, Wales and the . British Lions in rugby union, and Ferrari in Formula 1 – backs up the . theory. They might also point to Cardiff being promoted to the Premier League this year after changing their strip from blue to red. And Tiger Woods, for example, famously chooses to wear a red shirt on the last day of major competitions. Men who choose to wear red have higher levels of testosterone. This makes them more dominant and aggressive meaning they are more likely to win when playing competitive sport. Sportsmen also view opponents who are wearing red as tougher competition. But despite the link with . testosterone, those who chose red did not actually  perform better in . the study in which 73 men were told they would be performing a . competitive task and their performances would be placed on a . leaderboard. They then chose either a red or blue . symbol to represent them in the table and completed the tasks, as well . as answering questions aimed at gauging whether various personal reasons . may have affected their colour choice. Their testosterone levels were measured from saliva samples at the start of the study and again at the end. The data revealed that men who chose . red had higher baseline testosterone levels – and they rated the colour . as having higher levels of characteristics such as dominance and . aggression, than men who chose blue. But colour choice did not seem to be related to performance in the competitive task. The researchers believe that direct . competition, in which one of  several teams is wearing red, may be . necessary for the red advantage to occur. Higher testosterone levels make men more likely to win because it causes them to be more dominant and aggressive. Tiger Woods famously wears red on the last day of all major competitions . Dr Farrelly added: ‘In some species of monkeys the redness of skin relates to both the individual's testosterone levels and also their dominance. ‘It is possible that a similar innate effect may occur in humans.’ However, cultural associations made with the colour red, as in warning signs and traffic lights, may also have an impact. Dr Farrelly said: ‘This is the first study to look at whether biological factors, specifically testosterone which has been linked to characteristics such as dominance, aggression and competitiveness, may affect the choices we make in competitive scenarios. ‘Also by allowing participants in a test to choose their colour, this study reveals that there may be something intrinsically different about “red” competitors, that can give them an advantage.’","Men who wear red when competing have higher testosterone levels .

"After most of the world's population is wiped off the map by a wayward meteorite or hail of nuclear missiles, the survival of the human race might just depend on a few thousand people huddled in recreational vehicles deep in the bowels of an eastern Kansas mine. That's the vision of a California man who is creating what he calls the world's largest private underground survivor shelter, using a complex of limestone caves dug more than 100 years ago beneath gently rolling hills overlooking the Missouri River. 'I do believe I am on a mission and doing a spiritual thing,' said Robert Vicino, who has purchased a large portion of the former U.S. Army storage facility on the southeast edge of Atchison, about 50 miles northwest of Kansas City. 'We will certainly be part of the genesis.' Scroll down for video . Safe: Following a nuclear attack or a wayward meteorite, thousands of people could surivive by huddling  deep in the bowels of this eastern Kansas mine . Vast: Robert Vicino is creating what he calls the world's largest private underground survivor shelter . Huge: The shelter uses a complex of limestone caves dug more than 100 years ago beneath gently rolling hills overlooking the Missouri River . Before it comes time to ride out Armageddon or a deadly global pandemic, though, Vicino says the Vivos Survival Shelter and Resort will be a fun place for members to take vacations and learn assorted survival skills to prepare them for whatever world-changing catastrophe awaits. Jacque Pregont, president of the Atchison Chamber of Commerce, said some people think the shelter plan sounds creepy or that Vicino has 'lost his mind,' while others are excited because they will finally get a chance to tour the property. Atchison is known as the birthplace of Amelia Earhart and one of the most haunted towns in Kansas, Pregont said, so the survival shelter is likely to add to the town's tourism draw. 'It's quirky, and quirky gets attention,' she said. Recent Hollywood movies have done big business exploring themes about the human race, either through climate shifts, meteor impacts or zombie invasions. And the National Geographic Channel show, 'Doomsday Preppers,' documents the efforts of Americans who are preparing for the end of the world with elaborate shelters and plenty of freeze-dried rations. Protected: A fence helps guard the entrance to the Vivos Shelter and Resort . Leisure time: Before being used during an Armageddon or a deadly global pandemic, however, the Vivos Survival Shelter and Resort will be a fun place for people to take vacations and learn  survival skills . Paul Seyfried, who belongs to a group that promotes preparing for manmade or natural disasters, said Americans have become complacent ever since the death of John F. Kennedy, the last president who urged people to build fallout shelters. 'There has been no war on our soil in over 100 years, so the horror of war is not stamped indelibly in Americans' minds,' said Seyfried, a member of The American Civil Defense Association's advisory board. Ken Rose, a history professor at California State University-Chico, is an outspoken critic of underground shelters. Though he acknowledged that interest in underground shelters is growing, he called projects like the Kansas facility a 'colossal waste of time and money.' 'Some people are just obsessed by this idea,' Mr Rose said. '.. Without minimizing the terror threat here today, the threats were much greater at the height of the Cold War. At least then anxiety was based on a realistic scenario.' The Kansas caverns are 100 feet to 150 feet below the surface and have a constant natural temperature in the low 70s. Owner: Coby Cullins bought the complex and immediately started looking for ways to use it. One of his ideas was to lease the land to a company that builds survival bunkers . Large: Mr Cullins stands next to a scale model of the Vivos Shelter and Resort. The Army used the caverns for decades as a storage facility before putting them up for auction last year . They are supported by thick limestone . pillars six times stronger than concrete and will have blast doors . built to withstand a one-megaton nuclear explosion as close as 10 miles . away, Vicino said. Other . than being surrounded by more than a mile and a half of 6-foot-high . chain-link fence topped with sharp rows of barbed wire, the land above . ground isn't distinguishable from expanses of hills and trees that . surround it. The proposed shelter's entrances - nondescript concrete loading docks tucked discretely into the wooded hillside - are easily defensible against any potential intruders provided there's not a full-scale military attack, Vicino said. The Army used the caverns - created by limestone mining operations that started in the late 1880s - for decades as a storage facility before putting them up for auction last year. The winning bid in December was $1.7 million, but financing fell through and the site was put up for sale again. Springfield investor Coby Cullins submitted his winning $510,000 bid for the property in early April, and he immediately started looking for ways to use it. One of his ideas was to lease the land to a company that builds survival bunkers. Secure: The Kansas caverns are 100 feet to 150 feet below the surface. They will have blast doors built to withstand a one-megaton nuclear explosion as close as 10 miles away . Sprawling: Mr Cullins stands next to a map of the Vivos Shelter and Resort . Mr Vicino, whose company is based in . Del Mar, California, said he received an email from Cullins and flew to . Kansas two days later to check out the property. Vicino . agreed to purchase 75 per cent of the complex, rather than lease it, . while Cullins retained the rest and is marketing it to local businesses. The complex consists of two fully . lighted, temperature-controlled mines with concrete floors. The east . cave, which Cullins owns, encompasses about 15 acres and contains . offices, vaults, restrooms and other developed work spaces. The much larger west cave, which covers about 45 acres, is mostly undeveloped and will be converted into the Vivos facility. The shelter will have enough space for more than 1,000 RVs and up to about 5,000 people. Members will be charged $1,000 for every lineal foot of their RV to purchase their space, plus $1,500 per person for food. Underground: Investor Coby Cullins drives a golf cart in the darkness of one of the tunnels . That means a person who plans to park . a 30-foot vehicle in the shelter with four people inside will pay . $30,000 for the space and $6,000 for food. Actual . sales won't begin until a 'critical mass' of reservations are received . and processed, Vicino said, which hasn't happened yet at the Kansas . shelter. Vivos also owns a shelter in Indiana with room for 80 people to live comfortably for up to a year. There, members pay $50,000 per adult and $35,000 per child, so a family with two adults and two children would have to come up with $170,000 to be part of the post-apocalyptic generation. Purchasers will required to pay for the full balance before taking possession of their shelter space, though the company has offered limited financing in the past with a sizable down payment. Vicino says he won't say specifically where the Indiana shelter or any of his smaller facilities are located because he fears there would be anarchy in the event of a world-changing catastrophe. And it doesn't matter who comes knocking at the 'moment of truth,' Vicino said, they're probably not getting in. 'I've heard people say, ""I will just show up at the door,""' he said. 'Our response is, ""great, where is the door?"" At our secret shelters, you don't know where to go, and your cash will be worthless at that time.'","Caves will be 'the world's largest private underground survivor shelter'

"He is barely old enough to drive a car, let along a 50-tonne aircraft. But youngster Jonathan Irwin has become one of the country's youngest pilots ever to fly passengers on a commercial jet after being offered a job with British Airways at the age of 21. Mr Irwin, from Yorkshire, recently joined the airline as a First Officer, and will be assigned to fly an Airbus A320 aircraft from Gatwick Airport. He is scheduled to fly on short-haul routes across Europe. Scroll down for video . Mr Irwin, from Yorkshire, recently joined British Airways as a First Officer, and will be assigned to fly an Airbus A320 aircraft from Gatwick Airport . Mr Irwin's family said that being a pilot had been Jonathan's dream since he was just 11 years old. He was just 16 when he piloted a glider solo and has since spent five years training with the Air Training Corps 168 Leeds. Mr Irwin's father Paul said that his son is now dreaming of becoming a Captain. 'Ever since he was 11, Jonathan wanted to become a pilot,' he said. 'We're not an aviation family and he decided to go for it on his own. He's living his dream and he is absolutely loving it. 'We are absolutely delighted. It is a difficult profession and he has worked extremely hard. It's worth it to help pursue his dream and to see him happy.' According to the UK Civil Aviation Authority, the minimum age to be licensed for a commercial pilot's license is 18 if the pilot has earned an EASA Part-FCL Class 1 Medical Certificate and has met the training requirements. Paul added: 'If anyone is thinking of becoming a pilot, then work hard and go for it!' British Airways’ manager for pilot recruitment, Lindsay Craig, said: 'Jonathan, and all the other pilots from our British Airways Future Pilot Programme have done fantastically well to get through their rigorous training to arrive at this point. A British Airways Airbus 320 aircraft, similar to the plane that Mr Irwin will be flying for the airline . 'The training is incredibly tough, and standards are very high to ensure British Airways continues to get the best possible new pilots.' Mr Irwin's success comes just over a year after Merseyside teenager Ryan Irwin was offered a job as a pilot with Ryanair at the age of 19. Ryan, who is no relation to Jonathan, was offered a job with the budget carrier after qualifying as a pilot from the prestigious Oxford Aviation Academy. In 2008, 19-year-old Ed Gardner became the country's youngest commercial pilot when he was cleared to take the controls of a Boeing 737. He received his commercial licence while still a teenager and within a day had started work with Stansted-based charter firm, Titan Airways. Also in 2008 schoolboy Jack Dopson was awarded a Private Pilot's Licence at the age of just 16, just three months after he started taking flying lessons. The teenager took his first flying lesson less than a week after finishing his GCSE exams and six days before his 16th birthday. In 2012, Rachael Spelling became the youngest girl in Britain to pilot an aeroplane after taking to the skies on her 16th birthday. She first started taking accompanied flying lessons at the age of 14, soaring to 2,000ft in sole control of a Piper Archer aeroplane the moment she reached the minimum legal age for flying alone.","Jonathan Irwin has become one of the country's youngest-ever pilots .

"A quarter of new mothers said they were abandoned . by their NHS midwives during labour, with some left to give birth on the . floor or in corridors . Three damning reports last night laid bare the crisis in NHS hospitals, maternity units and GP surgeries. One investigation revealed that a quarter of new mothers were abandoned by their midwives during labour, with some left to give birth on the floor or in corridors. The second found that mistakes deemed so serious they should never happen are being made in hospitals five times a week. And the third survey said thousands of patients have all but given up trying to secure appointments with their family doctor. The reports come only a day after the NHS watchdog detailed a catalogue of failings at GP surgeries, including consulting rooms infested with maggots and patients being given dangerous, out-of-date drugs. Public confidence in the Health Service is already at a record low following a run of inquiries exposing a culture of appalling patient care and bureaucratic cover-ups. The shocking report into Mid Staffordshire hospitals, where hundreds are feared to have died needlessly because of neglect, led to increased scrutiny of death rates. As a result, further failures have been identified across the country and 12 trusts were put into special measures after inspectors found staffing shortages and an obsession with targets were putting patients at risk. Police have even been called in to probe claims that staff at Colchester Hospital fiddled figures to hide the fact that some patients waited up to six months for cancer treatment. Tory MP Steve Barclay said the lid was being lifted on long-running scandals: ‘In the past there has been a systematic cover-up and a desire for issues not to blow up on your watch. Police have been called in to probe claims that staff at Colchester Hospital fiddled figures to hide the fact that some patients waited up to six months for cancer treatment . ‘Politicians have been scared to . raise issues and nobody dared criticise the NHS. But the public are well . ahead of politicians and they’ve suspected problems for some time. I’ve . had elderly constituents scared to go into their local hospitals . because of their experiences or those of their spouses. ‘My worry with GPs is that there is very little scrutiny. People are just very grateful for their care.’ The investigation into maternity . units by the Care Quality Commission found that midwives due to help . women give birth at home were failing to turn up, while others were . unable to read machines that monitor babies’ heart beats. No access: A separate survey said thousands of patients have all but given up trying to secure appointments with their family doctor . Almost 150 NHS patients have been harmed by incidents that should never happen, according to new figures . Cathy Warwick of the Royal College of Midwives said: ‘It is sad to see that in three years the NHS has not improved in terms of women seeing the same midwife during their care, which often means women have to repeat their histories over and over.’ She said her union’s latest estimate was that the NHS in England was short of 4,800 midwives. Luciana Berger, Labour’s health spokesman, said new mothers were being badly let down. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said yesterday that NHS staff often confided in him about poor care. Blunders deemed so severe they should never happen are occurring five times a week in NHS hospitals, figures show. In the last six months there were 148 ‘never events’, including 69 where objects including swabs and scalpels were left in patients’ bodies. In one case, doctors carried out heart surgery on the wrong patient and in another, a man had laser surgery on his right eye rather than his left. One woman’s fallopian tube was removed instead of her appendix, while doctors left a large metal block inside another patient’s body. The figures from NHS England also show that 37 patients had surgery or treatment on the wrong part of their body and 21 were given the wrong implant or prosthetic limb. Five patients died or came to severe harm after nursing staff incorrectly inserted feeding tubes into their lungs. Newcastle Hospital Foundation hospitals reported the most never events. Addressing the General Medical Council conference in Manchester, he said: ‘People have come forward and said, it’s not as bad as Mid Staffs where I work, but even though I’m very glad to work at a fine hospital, I see things like that happening on my shifts and we need to sort it out. ‘There has been a hunger to really get to grips with these problems and sort them out and that is something we can be extremely proud of.’ Mr Hunt also said he’d seen some ‘incredible’ care and spoke of how a nurse had gone out of her way to reunite a dying cancer patient with his family in Ireland. The patient who otherwise would have died alone in hospital was flown out and spent his last two weeks surrounded by loved ones. Roger Goss, of Patient Concern, said one of the biggest concerns of patients was the inability to see a GP – a key finding of an NHS survey showing how patients had lost faith in family doctors. Nearly a third said they did not trust their out-of-hours service. ‘The primary care service is the major contact for most patients and if that isn’t up to scratch then how can it be that our NHS is supposedly the envy of the world,’ said Mr Goss. ‘There are surgeries where patients are queuing through the passage and out of the door just to get an appointment. ‘Many surgeries have patient unfriendly booking systems.’ The mistakes that should never happened were detailed by NHS England and included one woman being left infertile after doctors operated on the wrong side of her body. A Department of Health Spokesperson said: ‘People have a right to expect the best standards of care from their GP practice and hospital. A global study last month showed, the NHS is one of the best health services in the world.‘We want the NHS to be more transparent than ever before to help it continue to improve. We expect hospitals and GP practices to look at these figures and reports and take action to make the right improvements to ensure patients are receiving high quality care and services throughout the health service.’","Public confidence in the NHS at record low following run of inquiries .

He said that his father was shot six times in succession after Hernandez, who overheard a loud argument and came to investigate, spotted that he had a gun. Describing the shooting to the Daytona Beach News-Journal, he said: 'I kept telling them that he can’t hear them... I was right there. I saw the whole thing.' The incident was the second time the Millers had visited the towing yard to try to recover a vehicle, having come the previous day and also argued with store staff. Dispute: Mr Miller was arguing with staff at Fryer's Towing Service when Hernandez made his fatal intervention . Miller's son had a gun on the Friday, which caused employees at Fryer's Towing Service to call police. But when they arrived they realized that he was carrying his gun lawfully and left. A spokesman for the Sheriff's Office confirmed the killing, but did not provide details of the incident, which is currently under investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. He said: 'While the specific sequence of events isn’t being released at this time due to the ongoing investigation, during the encounter, Hernandez perceived a threat and fired his duty weapon, striking and killing the man.'","Edward Miller, 52, was killed by a Deputy Sheriff in Daytona Beach, Florida .

"The famous red and white spacesuit worn by Robin Williams in Mork and Mindy is up for auction , with an estimated price-tag of up to $20,000 . The famous red and white spacesuit worn by Robin Williams in hit 1970s TV series Mork and Mindy is up for auction next month, with an estimated price-tag of up to $20,000. Also on sale will be the 'egg' in which alien Mork traveled to earth from Ork in the breakthrough series for Williams. The Mrs Doubtfire actor was found dead at his home in the San Francisco Bay Area last month in an apparent suicide aged 63. 'This is such a big piece from a pop-culture, television history perspective,' Brian Chanes of the Profiles in History auction house told AFP. 'I think that it's going to stand on its own merit, not because of what recently, tragically, happened with Robin,' he added. The Mork spacesuit -- thought to be the only one ever to come up for public auction -- is estimated to fetch $15,000-$20,000, while the egg-spaceship could go for between $4,000 and $6,000. The items will go on sale at an auction of Hollywood memorabilia to be held from October 17-20 at the auction house in Calabasas, northwest of Los Angeles. The 63-year-old actor portrayed Mork, an alien from the planet Ork in the hit show which ran from 1978 to 1982 . Brian Chanes, Profiles in History consignor and client relations specialist, told Yahoo TV that the space suit was originally released by Paramount in the 1980s and has been kept in a private collection until recently. 'This was part of Paramount's wardrobe for years, and it went into a collection and now it's being released to the public,' Chanes said. 'We're very pleased to have that, because it's not only just a great piece of Robin Williams memorabilia, but it is a piece of television history.' Scroll down for video . The 63-year-old actor portrayed Mork, an alien from the planet Ork in the hit show which ran from 1978 to 1982 . He said the egg that is up for auction is not the one seen in opening credits of the sitcom which was was big enough for Williams to climb inside - this egg was used for other purposes on the series. 'This one was one of the transports, and it was used in the pilot episode,' he said. 'And then they used the flip side for other instances when an egg was coming or going, because that's how they would transport things, through these teleport eggs.' Brian Chanes, Profiles in History consignor and client relations specialist said that although the egg featured in the opening credits of the sitcom was big enough for a human to fit inside, the egg that will be on the auction block was used for other purposes on the series . 'This one was one of the transports, and it was used in the pilot episode,' Chanes said . Earlier this year Williams and his Mork and Mindy co-star Pam Dawber were reunited in his CBS comedy The Crazy Ones. In The Crazy Ones, Robin starred alongside Buffy actress Sarah Michelle Gellar, who played his uptight daughter, and the pair took to the stage in May 2013 to sell the show to advertisers at the annual TV Upfronts. The actor soon had advertisers eating out of the palm of his hand as the session descended into one of his trademark frenetic stand-up routines. He joked about strippers and likened the upfronts to the Westminster Kennel Club dog show 'but with more agents, and a little less ass-sniffing'. Robin Williams and Pam Dawber starred alongside each other in 1980s comedy series . As Robin reminded them, 'It’s been a long time since I’ve been on TV, 30 years, when there were much simpler upfronts - and a mound of coke.' As filming started Williams seemed to be back on form, posting pictures from the set on Twitter and Instagram. The series debuted to stellar ratings, with 15.6 million viewers it was the most-watched series premiere of the fall. However, viewers deserted the show and on May 10, CBS announced it was not picking up the show for a second season. This news is believed to have left Robin reeling. Indeed, weeks after the show was cancelled, Robin, who had struggled with alcoholism for decades and battled cocaine abuse in the 1980s, checked into rehab at the Hazeldon Addiction Treatment Center in Minnesota.","Robin Williams wore the suit in the hit 1970s television series .

"Boris Johnson tonight launched an extraordinary attack on Tories who have defected to UKIP, claiming they were the sort of people who injure themselves having sex with vacuum cleaners. He swept into the Tory party conference tonight, with senior party aides hoping he will do away with the nervous jitters caused by UKIP defections and Labour's poll lead. The London Mayor addressed a rally of Conservative activists tonight, mocking UKIP supporters and suggesting Nigel Farage should switch to become a Conservative. Scroll down for video . London Mayor Boris Johnson tore into UKIP supporters and defectors as he addressed a rally at the Tory party conference . Mr Johnson was cheered enthusiastically by Tory activists as he took the fight to the UKIP defectors who have overshadowed the start of the conference . The London Mayor addressed a rally of Conservative activists organised by the website Conservative Home . Mr Johnson vowed to take on the 'quitters, the splitters, the kippers' who are trying to undermine the Tory party. And he mocked defectors with an extraordinary sex joke. He told delighted Tory activists:'The EU commission wants to ban vacuum cleaners on the grounds that they are too powerful. ‘If you do not handle your vacuum cleaner correctly, you may end up inhaling the hamster – the budgerigar through the bars of the cage. ‘And I have read that there are some people – probably the type who are thinking of defecting to UKIP – who present themselves at A&E with barely credible injuries sustained through vacuum cleaner abuse.’ David Cameron is understood to be enraged by the behaviour of Tory MP Mark Reckless, who tried to derail the start of the conference by announcing he was defecting to Ukip. The Prime Minister is said to have erupted during one private reception at the conference about the MP sitting on his ‘fat a***’ and relying on activists’ hard work to get elected, only to betray their trust. He was also alleged to have called Mr Reckless a ‘d***h***’. The outspoken remark is likely to infuriate UKIP supporters, and will draw comparisons to when defence minister Anna Soubry said of Mr Farage: 'I always think he looks like somebody has put their finger up his bottom and he really rather likes it.' Standing together: David Cameron and Boris Johnson have both rounded on the 'quitters' of the Tory party . Mr Johnson pulled a remarkable face when asked what is the worse thing he has ever forgotten: he eventually recalled forgetting his mother's birthday . London Mayor Boris Johnson waves his lanyard to photographers as he arrives at the Hyatt Hotel in Birmingham . Tory strategists hope his arrival at the annual conference will deflect attention from the defection of two Tory MPs to UKIP . David Cameron is expected to pose for photographs with his old friend - and leadership rival - in an attempt to show he is one of the 'stars in the team'. Mr Johnson was in Birmingham this evening at an event entitled: 'How we win in 2015.' It is be the first time he has addressed the conference since announcing his plan to stand for election to Parliament in 2015. Mr Johnson said: 'I say to those who made headlines in the last few days – the quitters, and the splitters and the kippers – there’s only one party that’s going to sort out the European issue and there’s only one party that’s going to sort out the constitutional anomaly that allows Scottish MPs to vote on matters that only affect England when English MPs have no corresponding say over questions in Scotland. 'There’s only one party and there’s only one leader in our country who is going to sort that out and that is David Cameron,' Mr Johnson added. Mr Johnson also said he held a pub meeting with Mr Farage around 20 years ago when he was given 'vodka and caviar' and asked to defect. He added: ‘I said “No, Nigel, you join us”. I repeat my message today, because it is only the Conservatives who are able to deliver the kind of things he is talking about and it is only if the great conservative family unites and we stop Ed Miliband seizing back control of this country that we will be able to deliver the referendum that this country wants and deserves.’ Mr Johnson was cheered into the hall in the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham this evening . The London Mayor's address to conference delegates comes in the wake of two Tory MPs defecting to UKIP . The Mayor's speech, which got a standing ovation, came amid growing concern that more eurosceptic Tory MPs are planning to defect to UKIP. Rebel backbencher Mark Reckless announced his decision to leave the Conservative Party at the UKIP conference in Doncaster on Saturday. He became the second sitting Tory to leave for Nigel Farage's party, following Douglas Carswell's defection last month. Mr Reckless's defection, sparking a by-election in the Kent seat of Rochester and Strood, was the first of two blows for the Prime Minister at the start of this week's Conservative conference in Birmingham. It came hours before charities minister Brooks Newmark was forced to resign after it emerged he had sent X-rated pictures of himself to an undercover reporter. UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the party was in talks with more MPs to defect after Mark Reckless left the Tories on Saturday . Douglas Carswell became the first Conservative to defect to UKIP last month, sparking speculation that up to eight MPs were considering leaving the party . He has already given his fulsome backing to Chancellor George Osborne, who used his speech to conference at lunchtime to announce £25billion in spending cuts, including £billion from freezing benefits for two years. Speaking during a visit to a factory in Newcastle-under-Lyme on his way to the conference, London Mayor Boris Johnson said: 'If you want to have the cash to pay for the whole of society, then you need the economy to be going gang-busters. 'The most important thing for us in the UK economy is you've got to reform welfare and it's quite right that you should be looking at ways of improving how it's spent, but you've got to get the economy moving because that's the way to pay for the whole she-bang.' Earlier Mr Johnson tried his hand at making bricks during a visit to Newcastle-under-Lyne . He spent some time closely inspecting rows of unfired brick ready for cutting during a visit to Ibstock Brick Ltd . The Mayor even made, and signed, a brick which was then fired at the factory . Mr Johnson has been selected as the Tory candidate for Uxbridge and South Ruislip - a safe Tory seat - and hopes to return to government when his term as Mayor ends in 2016. This week Mr Cameron made clear Mr Johnson would have to remain on the backbenches until he has left City Hall. He told BBC One's Andrew Marr show: 'He's got to finish his term as Mayor of London. I know that's what he wants to do and I believe you can be a Member of Parliament and Mayor of London and do a very effective job. 'But once he's finished that, then you know he's a star and, as I've always said, I want to have the stars in the team.' Boris Johnson laid out a challenge to David Cameron in a rallying cry to Tory voters making clear that he had no problem with Britain leaving the EU. He said it was up to the Prime Minister to ‘deliver real change in Europe’ – including controls on EU immigration. Mr Johnson said it was important to ‘sort out our relations with Europe’. Boris Johnson today claimed it would be 'easy' to leave the EU and sign up to a free trade agreement . He said: ‘We all want reform. We want sensible control of the number of people coming in. It is the right and the duty of every state to have some idea of how many people want to settle in its boundaries, what jobs they propose to do there and how much it is going to cost its local authorities.’ The London Mayor’s remarks come amid growing embarrassment within the Tory hierarchy over the Government’s failure to cut net migration – which is back above 200,000 a year. Mr Cameron pledged to slash net migration to ‘tens of thousands’ a year. The London Mayor – who is the Tory candidate in Uxbridge and South Ruislip – also said it would be ‘easy’ for Britain to leave the EU but stay in a free trade zone. He said the single biggest problem which eurosceptics had to allay about leaving the EU was ‘the anxieties of international investors into this country’. Mr Johnson said: ‘In an ideal situation what I would like to see is a reformed EU where we remain squarely at the heart [of the EU].’ But he said: ‘If we couldn’t remain in the current EU we would remain within that free trade zone. ‘I think it would be very easy to set up a free-trade, tariff free zone – so for international investors they would have that reassurance. ‘It’s perfectly possible to construct a vision for this country, where we do better and better on our wits, on our fantastic ability to innovate.’ He added: ‘The EU as a percentage of global GDP has declined over the past 20 years – from about 29 per cent to about 19 per cent. It’s going down and down and down – as the potential target for our exports, that doesn’t mean it is not incredibly important. ‘What I am trying to argue, we could remain on either view in the single market and it would be absolutely insane and self-destructive of the other major nations to want to kick us out.’ He said it was ‘up to use and up to David Cameron to deliver a real change in Europe’","London Mayor delights activists at the party conference in Birmingham .

"James Blunt's lavish wedding reception was mired in controversy last night after it emerged it was at the centre of an official probe for going ahead without permission. The singer-songwriter and his society beauty wife Sofia Wellesley were caught up in a furore over their use of a secluded beach near Ibiza Town to celebrate the private upmarket do. Locals enjoying an afternoon out at the pretty hideaway of S'Estanyol vented their fury on Twitter after workers took over the cove to start setting up a storage tent and tables and chairs for 150 people on the sand. James Blunt is behind the wheel of his classic VW Beetle alongside wife Sofia Wellesley in Majorca, where they held a second wedding ceremony before heading to Ibiza . Some complained they had felt so uncomfortable they had headed home early. And there were even allegations non-guests had been turned away by event promotors with reflective armbands as they drove into the area. Last night, the local council announced it had launched an investigation and said it would be taking action against the organisers of the weekend event for staging the do without permission. Local coastal management chiefs were also reported to have opened a separate probe into claims the wedding banquet may have breached laws governing the use of public spaces. The Saturday night-time do took place a day after former army captain James and his wife, the granddaughter of the 8th Duke of Wellington, blessed their civil wedding at a London registry office with a religious ceremony on the neighbouring island of Majorca. Prince Harry, a friend from their days in the Household Cavalry, was expected to attend the wedding blessing and reception on Ibiza, where James owns a home. James Blunt and his wife Sofia Wellesley at Palma de Mallorca  airport - the couple blessed their civil wedding ceremony in London with a religious ceremony in Majorca before heading to Ibiza . The newlyweds were seen making their way through Palma de Mallorca airport with  friends and family . But a Majorcan-based wedding events firm confirmed last week James, 40, and legal consultant Sofia had married secretly and no royal would be attending the Majorca blessing and Ibiza bash. The singer, who achieved worldwide fame with the singles 'You're Beautiful' and 'Goodbye My Lover', has not been personally accused of any wrongdoing. It was unclear last night where town hall chiefs and coastal officials would end up pointing the finger. A spokesman for Santa Eularia Council, which covers S'Estanyol, said: 'I can confirm we have launched disciplinary proceedings over an alleged misdemeanour. James, 40, and legal consultant Sofia had married secretly and then celebrated with a blessing in Majorca blessing and an Ibiza bash . 'The event organisers had the obligation to ask us for permission before staging a private do of this kind and that didn't happen. 'We've also informed the coastal authorities given that a private use was made of a public space and there may also have been an infringement of the rules there if they too weren't informed. 'No official complaints were made to the local police on the day but we are aware of complaints being made on social networking sites. 'We are actively investigating those complaints although the probe is still at an early stage.' Sophia looked relaxed the day after the couple's second ceremony in Majorca . A source said: 'It's unlikely James Blunt and his wife will be held responsible unless it can be shown they obliged the organisers to occupy the beach in the way they did without permission. 'It's impossible to say at the moment but I imagine this will end up with the company behind the organisation of the event getting a fine.' The newly-wedded couple are thought to have flown to Ibiza from Majorca on Saturday morning. Onlookers said James, said to have compromised on his first choice of Ibiza for his wedding so it could take place on Majorca where his in-laws own a home, dressed formally in a suit and white shirt for the beach banquet while his wife wore a skirt and halter neck blouse. One furious local, venting his rage on Twitter that the private event had gone ahead in a popular cove, wrote: 'Can someone tell the mayor of Santa Eularia that S'Estanyol is a public beach.' Another said: 'A group of five people that were on the beach had to leave because they didn't feel comfortable.' Javier Aras, owner of the popular PK2 beach restaurant at S'Estanyol which the event took place by, said: 'All I provided was my bar after the banquet. 'The event outside was organised on the beach by another Ibiza-based company and they told me they had all the necessary permits. It had nothing to do with me. 'If I receive notification of disciplinary action from anyone, I'm going to give them that firm's name and tell them to deal with them. 'I have to say though that the event didn't start till 9pm when there was no-one else on the beach and the people who were putting out tables and chairs in the afternoon didn't upset anyone. 'The idea that non-guests were being diverted elsewhere is ludicrous. It just didn't happen. 'Ibiza depends on tourism and this furore is to do more political infighting at the town hall than anything else. 'I met James on the night and like the rest of the guests who were there, he seemed like a really nice bloke.' A spokesman for The Shop Ibiza, the company he named as the organisers, said: 'We just rent equipment. We rented out equipment to someone. We weren't the promoter. It's not our concern. 'I'm not going to talk about who my clients are and how my business is provided. James and Edinburgh University law graduate Sofia  got engaged in December 2013 after dating for a year . 'But it will be the promotor who receives a fine if there is a fine and I'm not aware of any fine at the moment.' No-one was available from (M)OMENTS, the Majorcan-based wedding events firm which press-released on James's wedding last week to inform he and his wife were requesting privacy and no royals had been invited. James and Edinburgh University law graduate Sofia were first introduced to each other by his sister Daisy. The couple got engaged in December 2013 after dating for a year. In March 2012 government officials in Majorca fined model Mark Vanderloo for celebrating his wedding to fellow model Robin Van der Meer in s'Espalmador without permission.

"ON SILBURY HILL by Adam Thorpe (Little Toller Books £15) When I went to University College London — before the M4 was constructed — my father would drive me (with all my bags and books) from our Wiltshire home, along the old Bath-London Road (now the A4). Each time we passed Silbury Hill, I would gaze up in fascination at the extraordinary, large tump at the side of the road, while my father hazarded guesses as to who built it and for what purpose. He liked to read about ancient history, and had a good line in ghostly speculation, too. Was it once an island, part of a sacred complex, or a resting place for the long-dead? What would it be like to climb it, at night, in a howling wind? The dark secret of the purpose of pre-historic Silbury Hill, in Wiltshire, still remains unknown . We know that Silbury is the largest prehistoric man-made mound in Europe — covering an area the size of three football pitches and probably built over a period of 100 years. But deeper certainty has always eluded those who have dug, tunnelled, photographed and studied it, from generations of archaeologists to writers such as Adam Thorpe. The enigma of this hill has inspired artists and poets, simply because people like mysteries. And what could be more mysterious than an upside-down pudding basin of earth and grass, a layer-cake of history plonked (by the devil, they used to say) at the side of an ancient route by the River Kennet? In his prize-winning book Ulverton, poet, novelist, playwright, and teacher (and not to mention one-time actor and puppeteer) Adam Thorpe gave us a brilliant overview of rural history. Now, he offers an equally creative, personal panorama of the hill he fell in love with as a boy. At nearby Marlborough College, he suffered the rules, torments and privations long-associated with English boarding schools, but escaped whenever possible into the surrounding downlands to climb strange Silbury and set his imagination free. That sense of wonder remains: ‘She was constructed without earth-movers or diggers, without power tools, without iron tools, without rulers and surveying instruments and hard hats, with only antler picks and ox shoulder blades and wickerwork baskets, plus human muscle. The hill is equivalent in size to a 13-storey building and yet was created without the aid of modern day tools . ‘At around 130 feet high, she is equivalent to a 13-storey building. If the Titanic sailed just behind her in your dreams, you would only see the smoke from the funnels.’ Thorpe’s narrative is as meandering as a walk up a tor, looping around and along tracks created by fox and badger, retracing steps, stopping to gaze at the surrounding landscape, and always entertained by reminiscences, happy and sad alike. In that sense, On Silbury Hill is another example of what might be called the new nature writing: unashamedly idiosyncratic and deeply personal, yet as well-researched as any historian would wish. Thorpe’s memories take us from Marlborough bullies to episodes in India and Cameroon, as well as stories from his days as a travelling player and neo-hippy. But, always, Silbury Hill is the lodestone that draws him back, and he wanders afresh around the surrounding countryside, taking in the dark secrets of Avebury, and speculating on both those ancient stones and the ones at Stonehenge — feeling ill at ease (it seems) in this modern world. Silbury Hill is located near to the ancient route of the River Kennet , which has long since dried up (left) and the mound has always intrigued author Adam Thorpe (right) In a fascinating series of interwoven strands, this book blends history, myth, archaeology, topography and poetry, and always leads us back to the haunting beauty of the question: ‘Why?’ Silbury will keep its secrets — but, on the subject of beauty and history, I must add that, in this era of digital downloads, it’s a real delight (and relief) to hold in my hand a small volume as perfect as this one, a work to treasure, part of the series of Little Toller Monographs, published in Dorset, and worthy of its subject.

"London's ghost Underground stations and tunnels could be sold off to developers so they can be transformed into art galleries, nightclubs and major tourist attractions. Over the next month, Transport for London is inviting companies to bid to become part of a transformation of abandoned Tube stations including some that were used as air raid shelters in the Second World War and others that even once housed immigrant workers. Interested companies could then convert the unusual underground spaces into venues for a range of new purposes. Scroll down for video . One of the most famous Tube stations likely to be offered for a new use is 107-year-old Aldwych Station . A direction sign inside the former Brompton Road tube station, a disused station on the Piccadilly line between South Kensington and Knightsbridge . Abandoned horse tunnels, once considered alternative routes for horse-drawn carriages, are also likely to be offered to businesses. One of the most famous Tube stations likely to be offered for a new use is 107-year-old Aldwych Station, which has been closed for the past 20 years. It was used during the Second World War to shelter artworks removed from public galleries and museums during the Blitz, including the Elgin Marbles. The tracks and platform stand empty at the Aldwych Underground station, which could be part of the portfolio involved in the bidding process . During the Second World War, some of London's Underground stations were used as air raid shelters . The Grade II-listed building is a popular film location and has appeared in a number of movies. Other stations that have played a key part in history and now lay abandoned include Down Street Tube on the Piccadilly line, which dates back more than 100 years and was used in WW2 as both an air raid shelter and an alternative retreat for Sir Winston Churchill when the Cabinet War Rooms were unavailable. Tunnels underneath Stockwell station housed up to 4,000 American troops as they returned home from Germany in 1945, and the Plessey tunnels in east London were used as an underground factory, where women made bullets and bombs. A makeshift warning sign next to the locked gateway leading to the platforms of the former Brompton Road Tube station . Tfl is expected to reveal plans next month for companies to make use of the underground premises . Among other possible uses being suggested for the disused stations and tunnels are tourist attractions, retail hubs, hotels and museums. Some of the underground premises were used as shelters during the war and also to house migrant workers during the 1940s. TfL, who owns 750 of the tunnels, is expected to reveal plans next month for companies to make use of the premises below ground while retaining their ownership. The idea of making use of abandoned stations and tunnels was first proposed in 2009 by former Barclays banking executive Ajit Chambers, 41, who believed the network could be worth £3.6billion. A subterranean kitchen garden, created in WW2 bomb shelters to grow exotic herbs and vegetables, is set up more than 100ft below the Northern Line . The Northern Line . Garden uses special LED energy bulbs and hydroponics system to grow crops including a range of exotic herbs, shoots, vegetables and flowers . Among possible uses being suggested for the disused stations and tunnels are retail hubs and hotels . The abandoned underground stations and tunnels could be worth £3.6billion. The idea to make use of abandoned stations was first proposed in 2009 . He set up the Old London Underground Company with the aim of renovating stations on behalf of TfL. Mr Chambers told MailOnline: 'In 2009 as part of my effort to assist the financial downturn in the UK, I founded a company that would unearth one of London’s state owned ‘‘sleeping property portfolios’’. 'I worked 24 hours a day for five years and am now fulfilling my promise to Mayor of London, Boris Johnson which was to add £200 million to the UK economy through this project. TfL is reluctant to confirm anything about the potential bidding process for tunnels and stations, but there are several iconic venue which could be included in the portfolio: . Old Brompton Road was built in 1812 and is the oldest London Underground Station. It sits on the Picaddilly line and was used as an anti aircraft control centre in WW2. The bunker is also thought to be where Rudolf Hess, Adolf Hitler's deputy in the Nazi Party, was brought to be interrogated after being captured in Scotland in 1941. Leinster Gardens houses a building with a false facade due to the development of the London Underground. With buildings taken out to develop the new mode of transport when it was first created, developers decided to conceal the unsightly cutting to create a District Line tunnel with a false building to keep up appearances. Down Street was first opened in 1907 but was closed in 1932. However, in WW2, it became of use again, housing the Emergency Railway Committee, it was also used by Winston Churchill of several occasions when the Cabinet War Rooms were unavailable. Aldwych was another station to open to great fanfare in 1907 that then feel into disrepair. However, in WW2 it was not only used as an air raid shelter, but as a storage facility for priceless works from the British Museum, including the Elgin Marbles. 'My investment model allows the public to invest in the stations and therefore share in the return of Investment, share offerings are currently managed from the country office near Brighton, East Sussex.' His proposals focus on 13 flagship stations with the intention that they should be converted into art galleries and nightclubs. Mr Chambers is also attracted by the idea of setting up a National Fire Brigade Museum. He has the support of four investors, including Duncan Vaughn-Arbuckle, the founder of wine museum Vinopolis in Southwark. There are 13 flagship stations which, if the plans go ahead, could be converted into art galleries and nightclubs . Mr Chambers has also been in talks with the Mandarin Hotel Group and West Court Real Estate - led by top designer Vinjay Kapoor. TfL are reluctant to talk about the plans at present. A spokeswoman said: 'We cannot show any prejudice ahead of a public tender.' Tunnels beneath Clapham North station are already used for a herb farm, while customers pick up goods from lockers at Chalfont & Latimer station on the Metropolitan line in Buckinghamshire.","The network of abandoned tube stations is believed to be worth £3.6billion .

"A Montana prosecutor is seeking 10 years in prison for a teacher who raped a 14-year-old student, after the Supreme Court rejected a one-month sentence from an earlier judge whose comments pinned some responsibility on the victim. A re-sentencing hearing for 55-year-old Stacey Dean Rambold is scheduled for Friday in Billings before Judge Randal Spaulding. Yellowstone County Attorney Scott Twito said he'll ask for 20 years in state prison with 10 years suspended. Going to jail for more than one month: Prosecutors are pushing for a heavier sentence to be given to Stacey Rambold, a former high school . teacher convicted of raping a 14-year-old student . Outrageous: Rambold has previously said that his 14-year-old victim Cherice . Moralez (pictured here) was responsible for his actions because she . appeared older than her age . Tragedy: The victim Cherice Moralez killed herself while the case against Rambold was pending . But in a memorandum with the court filed Tuesday, Rambold's attorney argued for a more lenient 15-year sentence to the Department of Corrections with all but two years suspended. Defense attorney Jay Lansing noted that Rambold has no prior criminal record and was ranked by the state as a low-risk sex offender. A Department of Corrections sentence could potentially allow Rambold to serve his time in a pre-release center or similar community setting rather than prison. The former Billings Senior High School teacher was 47 in 2007 when he raped freshman Cherice Moralez, a student in his business class. She committed suicide while the case was pending. He served his 30 days under the original sentence last year at Montana State Prison and has since been free. In Tuesday's court filing, Lansing urged Spaulding to review a pair of recorded interviews of Moralez conducted by law enforcement prior to her death. District Judge G. Todd Baugh, who handled Rambold's original sentencing, referenced those interviews when he commented last year that Moralez appeared 'older than her chronological age' and ""was probably as much in control of the situation as the defendant."" Rambold's attorneys also have suggested Moralez bore some responsibility. District Judge G. Todd Baugh: Baugh . sentenced Rambold to one-month in jail in 2013. He has since admitted his huge mistake and even tried . to re-sentence Rambold in August of that year but failed . Twito said he plans to call psychologist Brenda Roche to testify on what the interviews say about the victim's cognitive state. The recordings from 2008 and 2009 have not been publicly released. 'This is still a 14-year-old girl,' Twito said Tuesday. 'Children that age do not understand the consequences of their statements and their actions.' In a unanimous April ruling, the Supreme Court rejected Baugh's one-month sentence as illegal and ordered the case assigned to a new judge for re-sentencing. In their opinion, justices rejected the idea that Moralez' perceived maturity had any bearing on Rambold's punishment. Under state law, children younger than 16 cannot consent to sexual intercourse. Baugh plans to retire when his current term expires at the end of the year. In July, the Supreme Court publicly reprimanded the six-term judge, invoking a rarely-used censure to declare him guilty of misconduct in the case. Spaulding, of Roundup, was named to the case after six other judges recused themselves.

"David Cameron is preparing to issue a personal apologise to the Queen after he was caught boasting she had ‘purred down the line’ when he called to tell her Scotland had rejected independence. The Prime Minister was said to be ‘deeply embarrassed’ last night after he was inadvertently caught on camera discussing the Queen’s reaction to last week’s referendum. His comments were blasted by Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, who led the campaign for independence, as 'absolutely pathetic'. Scroll down for video . In an extraordinary sequence, David Cameron was today heard talking about the moment he rang the Queen at Balmoral to give her the news about the vote . Despite being just feet from the cameras, Mr Cameron appears to have had no qualms about being so indiscreet about his private discussions with the head of state . He told BBC Scotland: 'David Cameron has been prime minister for four years and he hasn't learned basic civility on not gossiping about what Her Majesty The Queen thinks, or doesn't think, to Michael Bloomberg, or anyone else for that matter. 'That's absolutely pathetic and he should hang his head in shame.' Mr Cameron is in New York for talks at the United Nations on tackling the rise of ISIS extremists. But sources indicated the Prime Minister will issue a private apology to Her Majesty over what experts described as an ‘extraordinary breach of protocol’. apparently said she had ‘purred down the line’ when she was told Scots had voted by 55 per cent to 45 to remain part of the UK. Audio experts at the BBC, who analysed the footage, claim he then said: ‘I have never heard someone tear up like that.’ Other listeners were divided, with some saying Mr Cameron had described the Queen as seeming ‘happy’ and ‘grateful’. His comments were blasted by Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, who led the campaign for independence, as 'absolutely pathetic' The astonishing slip came as he chatted with billionaire US media mogul Michael Bloomberg at a trade event in New York yesterday. Mr Cameron appeared to be unaware that his conversation with the former New York mayor was being picked up by the microphone of a camera, which was filming the two men walking into the meeting. Mr Cameron, smiling broadly, can be heard saying: ‘The definition of relief, if you are Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, is ringing up Her Majesty the Queen and saying, “Your Majesty, it is all right, it’s OK.” That was something. That’s relief. She purred down the line.’ The Prime Minister then seems to say: ‘I’ve never, I’ve never heard someone tear up like that ... grateful.’ However, other listeners claimed he had said ‘cheer up’. His comments are embarrassing for the Queen, who stuck scrupulously to her constitutional position of not intervening in politics during the referendum campaign. The closest she came to a comment was when she urged voters to ‘think carefully’ before casting their ballots – interpreted by some as support for a No vote. Downing Street last night declined to comment on what it described as a ‘private conversation’ with Mr Bloomberg. The 38-second piece of footage was put out on a pool basis to newscasters, but Mr Cameron’s unguarded remarks were initially picked up by Sky News. In the most astonishing remark, Mr Cameron was heard to claim that The Queen 'purred down the line' Continuing the bizarre train of thought, the Prime Minister claimed pollsters had given him stomach ulcers . In the video recording, David Cameron can clearly be heard discussing his private conversations with the Queen. He said: . 'The definition of relief is being the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and ringing the Queen and saying 'It's alright, it's okay'. That was something.... 'She purred down the line... 'But it should never have been that close. 'It wasn't in the end, but there was a time in the middle of the campaign when it felt… . 'I've said I want to find these polling companies and I want to sue them for my stomach ulcers because of what they put me through. 'It was very nervous moments.' By yesterday evening, #purringqueen was trending on Twitter after the report went viral. In an apparent rebuke, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ‘We would never comment on a private conversation between Her Majesty and the Prime Minister.’ But the Queen’s former press secretary, Dickie Arbiter, described Mr Cameron’s blunder as an astonishing breach of protocol. He said: ‘I find it extraordinary that a Prime Minister, a head of government, could refer in such a casual way to a conversation he has had with the head of state. ‘This is compounded by the fact that the person to whom he is speaking was, to all intents and purposes, a complete stranger. ‘The Queen’s conversation with her prime ministers are entirely confidential for a very good reason. ‘It is the cornerstone of their relationship and the basis on which she can exert her constitutional right to advise, encourage and warn. You simply can’t afford to have such a casual attitude to this when you are Prime Minister. ‘He, of all people, should have been aware of the cameras and that they could pick his conversation up. Even Tony Blair, for all his bluster, has always kept schtum about the Queen.’ Former Labour defence minister Kevan Jones said Mr Cameron’s slip betrayed an ‘arrogant and disrespectful’ attitude. He added: ‘The Queen worked enormously hard to maintain her neutrality during the referendum campaign despite a great deal of pressure to speak out. I am sure the Palace will be mortified that her private thoughts have now been blurted out by her own Prime Minister.’ Mr Cameron provoked anger in 2011 when he revealed to MPs that Prince William had personally lobbied against cuts to Britain’s air-sea rescue capability. But his latest slip is likely to cause much graver offence at the Palace. It could also spark anger among pro-independence Scots. David Cameron claimed The Queen 'purred down the line' when he called her to say Scotland had voted against independence . The blunder came after Mr Bloomberg congratulated Mr Cameron over the outcome of the referendum. The first part of the Prime Minister’s response is inaudible, but he then says: ‘It should never have been that close. ‘It wasn’t in the end, but there was a time in the middle of the campaign when it felt…’ He is then heard hitting out at the pollsters, who sparked panic in Westminster by briefly suggesting the Yes campaign was on course to win. The comments will fuel concerns among Tory MPs that Mr Cameron panicked and offered major concessions to Scotland on the basis of one or two rogue polls. Speaking about his own reaction to the Scottish No vote, Mr Cameron told NBC News: ‘I was extremely nervous and worried because I’m a passionate believer in the United Kingdom. I represent an English constituency. ‘I’m English ... I’m also British, and I care massively about the potential break-up of our country.’ The extraordinary remarks were picked up as Mr Cameron went on a walkabout at the Bloomberg headquarters in New York, with the city's former mayor Michael Bloomberg . Mr Cameron also vowed to 'sue' polling companies who suggested the Yes campaign was ahead in the referendum campaign, claiming the worry had given him 'stomach ulcers' Scottish First Minister Alex Salmon today returned to the Scottish Parliament today, with his deputy Nicola Sturgeon,  for the first time since he saw his dream of independence rejected by voters . Late on Saturday September 6, details of a YouGov poll for the Sunday Times emerged, putting Yes on 51 per cent and No on 49 per cent . Prime Minister David Cameron has a reputation for speaking before he thinks . 'UKIP is sort of a bunch of ... fruitcakes and loonies and closet racists, mostly.' April 2006 .

"Miss America defended her crown and reputation today as she spoke out for the first time on allegations that she was kicked out of her college sorority for brutal hazing. Kira Kazantsev from Long Island, New York, told GMA on Tuesday that the allegations were not only untrue but incredibly hurtful. The 22-year-old said: 'Under the broad definition of hazing, I was involved... It was part of the culture at Hofstra at the time.' Scroll down for video . Miss America Kira Kazantsev admitted to being involved in hazing while part of the Alpha Phi sorority at Hofstra University in Long Island, New York. She was later kicked out of the sorority for alleged brutal hazing . Not nice: New Miss America Kira Kazantsev was allegedly kicked out of her sorority last year for hazing pledges . Miss Kazantsev, who beat 52 other young women to become Miss America 2015 last week, also described the hazing she had taken part as an Alpha Phi sorority sister at Hofstra University in Long Island, New York. She said the hazing consisted of 'having to stand in a line and recite information, perform mundane tasks and participate in 'crafting... and a few traditional things'. The newly-minted Miss America was expelled from the sorority last year for alleged brutal hazing of new recruits. She claimed she was asked to leave the sorority after she made a joke which was taken out of context. Miss Kazantsev claimed on Tuesday that she was kicked out of her sorority last year for making a joke which was taken the wrong way . 'I was asked by an educator to reach out to new students and I made a joke which was taken out of context and sent to the national office,' she said. 'The joke was that we would make the evening scary for the pledges at an event which never came to fruition.' Following the allegations, Miss Kazantsev said she hoped to turn the negative experience into a positive. The pageant winner, who stood on a platform of anti-domestic violence, said she would share the message with her young fans that it's ok to make mistakes in life. Miss Kazantsev, formerly Miss New York, won the national competition with her sweet performance of Pharrell's song 'Happy' choreographed with a cup. Silence: Neither Hofstra or the Alpha Phi sorority issued public congratulations to Kazantsev when she was crowned Miss America earlier this month. A picture of Hofstra's Long Island, New York campus picture above . On her resume, Kazantsev lists that she was new member educator and recruitment committee president for the university's chapter of Alpha Phi, a position she reportedly shared with her best friend in the spring term of 2013. Kazantsev, pictured in the pageant's bikini round last week, said she hoped to turn the hazing allegations into a positive . A source told Jezebel that Kazantsev and her friend made the pledges' lives 'a living hell' by calling them names, and berating them over physical flaws. The sorority sisters reportedly made the new members perform certain physical tasks to the point of bruising and exhaustion. When someone reported the harsh punishments, Kazantsev and her friend were kicked out of the sorority, near the end of her senior year. They were banned from attending any sorority events, but allegedly sneaked into the society's end-of-year formal with their dates anyway. After she was crowned Miss America for 2015 last week, neither the university or the sorority issued statements of congratulations. When a Jezebel reporter called up the university to ask about a 'high-profile individual who was expelled from her sorority in late April 2013', a representative said 'Was this person, by chance, in Atlantic City last Sunday night?' However, that representative wasn't allowed to say more on the disciplinary matter, per the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA. The Miss America organization has since issued a statement on the hazing allegations, saying Kira has been  'fully transparent' about her termination from Alpha Phi. 'It's unfortunate that this incident has been exploited to create a story line that distracts from what we should be focusing on: Kira's impressive academic achievements at Hofstra University, including earning a triple major from the Honors College and her commitment to serving her community. 'Kira is an exceptional ambassador for the Miss America Organization, and we are excited to be a part of her journey as a force for good across our nation, promoting education and service and working to empower young women,' the statement reads. Kazantsev graduated from the Long Island university in 2013 with honors and three degrees in Political Science, Geography and Global Studies. The daughter of Russian immigrants, Kazantsev is fluent in English, Spanish and Russian. She was the third-consecutive Miss New York to be crowned Miss America, and has viciously defended her internship at Planned Parenthood. 'It was close to my university and I care about women's health. 'It's really important that teens know what resources are available to them and learn to be respectful of their bodies and other peoples' bodies,' she told Cosmopolitan.

"The Costa Concordia will finally be righted next week in the largest and most expensive maritime salvage operation in history. The cost of lifting the giant cruise liner, which sank off the coast of Tuscany in January 2012, off the sea bed, has ballooned to £500million - a figure that could rise if there are problems, organisers admitted. Thirty-two people died when the ship, with 4,200 passengers onboard, hit rocks and ran aground off the island of Giglio after an ill-judged 'salute' to inhabitants by the ship’s captain. Scroll down for video . Heaving work: An underwater platform has been built on which the 114,00-tonne ship will come to rest as jacks and underwater cables haul it upright . The Costa Concordia will finally be righted next week in the largest and most expensive maritime salvage operation in history. Thirty two people died when the ship hit rocks and ran aground off the island of Giglio in January 2012 after an ill-judged 'salute' to inhabitants by the ship's captain . Stricken: Salvage ships circle around the wreck of Costa Concordia as it lies on its side next to Giglio Island in this aerial picture taken from an Italian navy helicopter . Salvage: 500 engineers and 18,000 tonnes of cement will be used to try to haul the Costa Concordia from its current resting place on its side next to Giglio Island . The enormous operation, to pull the . ship off the reef where it capsized, is due to start at dawn on Monday, . weather permitting, and will take 10 to 12 hours, with 500 people . working on the project. The Concordia is currently lying on its . side on an underwater reef. An underwater platform has been built on . which the ship will come to rest as a system of jacks and underwater . cables haul it upright. Uncharted territory: The international team of engineers will use a never-before attempted strategy to set upright the luxury liner . Tragic: The giant wreck of Costa Concordia has lain partly submerged in shallow waters off the Tuscan island of Giglio since the accident in January 2012 . Huge task: The Costa Concordia cruise ship could be upright again next week, nearly two years after the liner capsized and killed at least 30 people . The Concordia is currently lying on its side on an underwater reef. An underwater platform has been built on which the ship will come to rest as a system of jacks and cables haul it upright . The enormous operation, to pull the ship off the reef where it capsized, is due to start at dawn on Monday, weather permitting, and will take 10 to 12 hours, with 500 people working on the project. Above, a graphic of how the ship is stricken on the reef . It will be rolled onto the platform in a manoeuvre known as parbuckling. Workers . will look for the bodies of two people, an Italian and an Indian . unaccounted for since the disaster, as machines haul the 114,000-tonne . ship upright and underwater cameras comb the seabed. Assuming seas are calm, the ship will be slowly pulled to the vertical in an hours-long operation so it can be towed to a mainland port and turned into scrap . Dozens of crank-like pulleys will start slowly rotating the ship upright at a rate of about 3 metres per hour. Steel chains weighing 17,000 tons have been looped under the vessel to help pull it upright. Tanks filled with water on the exposed side will also help rotate it upward . The 114,00-tonne ship will be rolled onto the platform in a manoeuvre known as parbuckling . Unprecedented: The cost of refloating the Costa Concordia has risen to £500million and has involved 500 engineers . Enormity: An aerial view shows the huge scale of Costa Concordia - equivalent to a floating city - set against the backdrop of the houses on Giglio Island . An international team of . engineers and other experts has devised no 'Plan B' if the attempt to . right the hulking wreck goes wrong and . the cruise liner splits apart or falls back on its side. Assuming . seas are calm, the ship will be slowly pulled to the vertical in an . hours-long operation so it can be towed to a mainland port and turned . into scrap. The . possibility that the ship might fall apart is a 'remote event', insisted Franco Gabrielli, head of Italy's Civil . Protection agency, at a briefing to lay out logistics. 'If the . ship doesn't turn back upright, there is no other way to try it . again,' he said. The reef sliced a . 70m (230ft) long gash into a side of the hull, seawater rushed . in and the Concordia began to lean over on one side, listing so quickly . that many lifeboats couldn't be lowered to help save the 4,200 . passengers and cruise aboard the pleasure cruise. Many . of Giglio's 1,500 inhabitants work or go to school on the mainland, and . authorities will let one last ferry sail from the island at dawn . on Monday. But no ferries or other boats will be allowed until the effort . is completed. If seas are rough, or a storm looms, the ship's rotation . will be postponed to a later day next week. Divers have pumped 18,000 tonnes of cement into bags below the ship to support it and prevent it from breaking up. A . buoyancy device acting 'like a neck brace for an injured patient' will . hold together the ship's bow, and fishing nets will catch debris as it . rises from beneath the ship, said Nicholas Sloane, senior salvage master . at Titan Salvage. The . salvage team will go through the ship cabin by cabin and hand over items . found on board to the Italian state prosecutor, and the vessel will be . towed away to be dismantled. The greatest fear for environmentalists is that the ship will break up under the massive force needed to haul it upright. The Italian Department for the Environment have also highlighted the danger of pollution as thousands of tonnes of water inside the ship pours out. The ship’s fuel has been removed over months by divers and construction workers toiling 24 hours a day, but chemicals and toxins from rotting food and drink remain. Arpat, the Regional Environmental Agency of Tuscany, said it ‘will provide a sampling of the water in the affected area both during the rotation and in the days to follow, in order to identify the extent, the extension and duration of pollution.’ Mr Sloane admitted that there are risks - but once the operation begins, there is no way to stop it. ‘Once you start lifting her off the reef, you have already gone beyond the point of no return,’ he said. National Civil Protection agency head Franco Gabrielli said: 'This scale of operation has never been attempted before. 'Like all things that have never been done before, there are elements of uncertainty.' He added: 'The theory that the wreck will break is a remote possibility. 'What’s more likely is the possibility of spills. 'Specific plans have been put in place if that happens.' Eventually, in a secondary operation, the cruise liner will be refloated and towed away to be broken up for scrap metal. Four Costa Concordia crew members and a Costa Cruises company official were sentenced to jail in July for their part in the accident, and the ship's captain Francesco Schettino remains on trial for manslaughter and causing the loss of the ship. The captain is accused of abandoning ship before all crew and passengers had been rescued. A coastguard's angry phone order to him - 'Get back on board, damn it!' - became a catchphrase in Italy after the accident. Four Costa Concordia crew members and a Costa Cruises company official were sentenced to jail in July for their part in the accident, and the ship's captain Francesco Schettino (above) remains on trial for manslaughter and causing the loss of the ship . Passengers onboard the cruise ship Costa Concordia wait to be evacuated after it ran aground . Pulleys, rotation and steel chains: The art of parbuckling . A 500-member salvage team from 24 nations will be conducting the operation to move the ship, known in nautical terms as parbuckling, before the autumn storm season arrives, when winds and powerful waves risk battering it to the point it won't hold together. Dozens of crank-like pulleys will start slowly rotating the ship upright at a rate of about 3metres per hour. Steel chains weighing 17,000 tons have been looped under the vessel to help pull it upright. Tanks filled with water on the exposed side will also help rotate it upward. Although parbuckling is a tested way to set upright capsized vessels, the operation has never been applied to a huge cruise liner. The ship's fuel has been removed over months by divers and construction workers toiling 24 hours a day, but chemicals and toxins from rotting food and drink remain . Mr Sloane said the Concordia will suffer an 'extreme amount of force' of compression in the first part of the manoeuvre. He is 'pretty satisfied' the vessel will survive the stress, adding: 'We expect her to come up to vertical'. 'She's resting in pristine waters on this hill' of two massive pieces of sloping granite seabed, Sloane said. Tension: Observers will hold their breath during the difficult and never-before-tried operation to salvage the Costa Concordia is attempted . He likened the ship's hull bottom to a 'big belly... about the size of a football field' perched on the two reefs. Months ago, divers inserted cement-filled bags and grouting between the reefs to provide more stability. The aim of the parbuckling is to set the wreck upright on an underwater platform that has been installed. 'The objective is to get her to move very slowly and gently,' Sloane said. Engineers indicated they would be anxiously watching the early parts of the effort. Once the ship moves upward some 25 degrees, Sloane said: 'At that point, gravity takes over, and at that point, we start feeling relief.'","114,00-tonne ship sank off the coast of Tuscany in January 2012 and is due to be lifted on Monday .

"The 19-year-old who was shot dead on a Los Angeles highway was once in the city’s Police Department Explorer Academy, but had been discharged because of disciplinary reasons, it has been revealed. Though it is unclear why Abdul Arian was removed from the program, police confirmed the program teaches students who are interested in careers in law enforcement. Arian was killed on live television after a dramatic chase down Highway 101. Police chase: Unarmed motorist Abdul Arian is seen running backwards and simulating pointing a weapon . Desperate: Abdul Arian, 19, was reportedly unarmed as police caught up with him on the 101 Freeway . Tragic loss: This undated photo shows Ray Karimee, left, and his younger cousin, Abdul, while family members are at a loss as to what caused Abdul's erratic behaviour (left centre and right) Abdul: I have been arrested before for possession of destructive devices, I'm not afraid of the cops. If they pull their guns, I'm going to have to pull my gun out on them. Police dispatcher: I don't want you to hurt yourself. Abdul: I'm not gonna get hurt s*** h***, f*** these police, they're going to get hurt. Arian’s uncle, Hamed Arian, told the . Los Angeles Times that his nephew aspired to be a police officer. He . said: ‘He wanted to be an LAPD cop, and the LAPD killed him.’ The dramatic video shows an LAPD . police patrol car smashing into Arian's car as he does a failed U-turn . in the road before he flees simulating pointing a weapon at chasing . police. News helicopter footage from CBS Sky 2 shows Arian jumping out of his car, turning and fleeing the scene running backwards. He then repeatedly spins around in a combat stance just before he was shot on the US 101 Freeway in Woodland Hills, LA. But a different picture is emerging of the man who was killed after the high-speed car chase. His . Facebook page suggests a different story with Arian posting comments . and pictures which shed light on his interests and lifestyle. In one on April 5, he posted a status update, saying: 'Just came back from the shooting range.' There is also an enlarged photo of his car posted on the page. Beaming: A glowing undated picture of the teenager in happier times . Fled: Arian left his car behind to try and avert chasing police in the dramatic footage captured on live television . A helicoptor news camera captures the fleeing 19-year-old after he had failed to stop for driving recklessly . It has emerged that Arian made a . frantic 911 call to police during the pursuit, saying he had a gun, but . one wasn't recovered from the scene. Arian was shot dead by an officer as he fled his vehicle just before 10pm Friday night. The . images of last night's police chase show the aftermath of the scene on . the freeway wreathed with smashed remnants of the suspect’s car and . bullet casings. The shooting comes at a very sensitive time in America following the huge public outcry over Trayvon Martin's shooting. In a case which has gripped America . and generated international headlines, Martin's killer George Zimmerman, . who claimed he was acting in self defence, was charged with second . degree murder this week after police hunted him for 45 days. He faces the prospect of life in prison. Lieutenant Andy Neiman said: 'The investigation will determine what happened, what the officer saw, what the witnesses saw. 'Sometimes what you see from a live shot from the air unit may or may not be exactly what people think so until we determine exactly what the witnesses saw, we can't make any comment on that. Asked if the suspect was carrying a gun, Lt. Neiman said: 'That has not been determined at this point.' The suspect's uncle Hamed Arian told the station: 'He was a nice kid. He was working. He was such a sweet kid, respectful to others. 'He wanted to be a cop and like I said before, during the chase last night, he was calling 911. 'He was afraid of cops. You know, he told me he wants to be a good cop, not a crooked cop.' His family revealed he was working as a party-planning company as he pursued his dream of becoming a police officer. Family members told how he graduated Taft High School but officials with the Los Angeles Unified . School District said he left Taft in October 2011. It was unclear if he . received his General Education Development (GED) test. CBS reported that no weapon had been recovered from the scene as they reported the story last night. The 101 Freeway was littered with smashed car remnants and bullet casings as police arrived on the scene . Carrying a gun? Lt Neiman says everything is not always as it seems from live TV images as the suspect appeared to be simulating holding a weapon . Arian's uncle Hamed said he was a young man who neither took drugs or drank alcohol and was 'afraid of guns'. Abdul was shot dead by police after they fired off more than 90 rounds after a high-speed chase . The youth's uncle said he last saw his nephew at 6pm on Wednesday night when he left for the gym, where he typically lifted weights and had a personal trainer. Just four hours later, police say they saw Arian driving erratically on the Northridge Fashion Center and tried to pull him over. But he refused and police pursued him on a frenetic, high-speed chase through the city's streets before he pulled onto the Ventura Freeway, ending on the eastbound 101 freeway. The suspect's car was a Crown Victoria, which his uncle revealed was a one-time police cruiser that had been bought at an auction. According to a partial transcript of the call made by Arian to a police dispatcher, he said: 'I have been arrested before for possession of destructive devices, I'm not afraid of the cops. 'If they pull their guns, I'm going to have to pull my gun out on them.' The dispatcher desperately tried to stop Arian, pleading with him: 'I don't want you to hurt yourself.' Arian responded with a string of expletives before and a threat: 'These police, they're going to get hurt.' 'As soon as he came out from (the) gym, he ran a red light,' Hamed told Channel 2. 'He panicked. OK? He panicked and he ran."" He suggested that when his nephew got out of the car, he was trying to tell police that he was on the phone with 911. Lt. Neiman added: 'It's certainly bizarre behavior, and it ended in a tragic situation for all involved.' Despairing family members gathered together this morning as news of Arian's death spread. Consoling each other outside his uncle Hamed's home, they desperately tried to make sense of his death. The young man was an aspiring policeman yet he also declared a dislike for police, they said.

"A teenage girl has narrowly avoided death after smoking 'synthetic marijuana' that she bought from a gas station and suffering a series of strokes. Seventeen-year-old Emily Bauer, from Cypress, Texas, has been left with brain damage, paralysis and is unable to see after taking the synthetic weed with friends last December. Her family is now hoping to raise awareness of the dangers of the substance, which is often labelled as 'potpourri', while campaigners battle for stricter laws to make it illegal across the country. Fake weed, which is also known as 'Spice' or 'K2', is an herbal mixture doused with chemicals that trigger a high similar to smoking marijuana, according to the . National Institute on Drug Abuse. Former life: Seventeen-year-old Emily Bauer started experiencing severe migraines in December, after smoking a synthetic weed she had bought from a gas station . It is often sold as incense or potpourri, and is advertised as a legal alternative to weed. While many states have outlawed it, manufacturers have responded by slightly changing the compound so that it can return to shelves. Emily smoked the drug last December with friends and within 15 minutes, she told her boyfriend she was suffering from a migraine and needed to lay down. She suffered a series of strokes which left her in a psychotic-like state, during which she urinated on herself, ran into walls, hallucinated and acted violently, her sister told CNN's iReport. The police were called to help restrain her into an ambulance, and she was taken to Northwest Cypress Hospital, where she bit guardrails and attempted to bite medical staff. Struck down: The drug caused her blood vessels to constrict and she suffered a series of strokes . Frightening: Her family decided to take out her breathing tube - yet the teenager fought for life . 'We thought once she comes down off the . drug, we'd take her home and show her the dangers of this drug,' her older sister, Blake, said. 'We didn't think it was as big of a deal until 24 hours . later she was still violent and hurting herself. We realized you're not . supposed to stay high this long.' She was put into an induced coma as doctors carried out tests on her brain. Doctors soon found Emily's strokes had caused severe vasculitis, meaning contracting blood vessels had constricted the flow of blood and cut off oxygen to her brain. 'In four days' time, we went from . thinking everything is going to be OK and we'll put her in drug . rehabilitation to now you don't know if she's going to make it,' stepfather Tommy Bryant told CNN. Danger: Emily bought the legal 'fake weed' Klimax potpourri by Kush, above, from a gas station . Different life: Emily is now blind and largely paralysed but continues to make small improvements . Synthetic marijuana, which is known as 'Spice' or 'K2', is an herbal mixture sprayed with chemicals that create a high similar to smoking marijuana, according to the . National Institute on Drug Abuse. Advertised as a 'legal' alternative . to . weed, it's often sold as incense or potpourri. When many states . outlawed the drug, manufacturers slightly changed the compound so they . were no longer illegal. It was linked to 11,406 . drug-related emergency department visits in 2010, a study by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health . Services Administration found. Most were aged 12 to 17. The first state laws banning synthetic . drugs were established in 2010. Now at least 41 states have banned them, but that has not deterred the manufacturers. 'These drug manufacturers slightly . change the chemical compound, and it becomes a different substance . that's not covered by the law,' said NCSL policy specialist Alison . Lawrence. Common side effects from smoking synthetic . marijuana include bloodshot eyes, disturbed perceptions, a change in . mood, paranoia, raised blood pressure or hallucinations. Doctors soon found Emily's blood vessels were expanding again and while the family saw it as a sign of improvement, pressure on the teenager's brain grew rapidly - and dangerously. Surgeons had to drill a hole in her skull and insert a tube to relieve pressure. But her brain was still affected. 'We met with Neurology team who showed . us Emily's brain images,' her mother, Tonya Bauer, said. 'They told us that all white areas on images were . dead. It looked to us at least 70 per cent of the images were white.' Doctors said Emily would not be able to recognise her family and would never be able to use her arms or legs again. With this heart-breaking news, Emily's parents made the tough decision to take out her breathing tube and stopped all nourishment on December 16 - but she continued to fight. As her mother went to her room one morning, she said, 'Good morning, I love you' and was stunned to hear a hoarse voice saying: 'I love you too.' 'Even though she couldn't move, is . blind, and could hardly be aware of what was going on around her, she . laughed with us as we made jokes and listened to her soft whisper . replies,' Blake said. 'It is my little sister shining through, in every way she can manage, with every ounce of strength.' Struggle: Emily, pictured hooked up to an ECG, has started eating solid food again in an encouraging sign . New world: Emily is believed to have smoked the fake weed with friends after buying it from a gas station . Emily knows where she is and recognises her family, but every day is still shrouded in confusion. The family does not know how much control she will recover, but she is already moving her arms and legs, and two weeks ago she started eating solid food again. Emily's parents have started a . nonprofit organization called Synthetic Awareness For Emily to educate teenagers and parents about the dangers of synthetic marijuana use. 'Ee want to let kids and . parents know about the warnings signs: migraines and withdrawal,' Bryant said. 'We all know the warning signs of alcohol and cocaine, but with . this synthetic weed stuff, it's so new that nobody knows about this . stuff. We want to let other parents know about this so they don't have . to go what we've been going through.' Lack of awareness: Emily's family said they had no idea how dangerous the fake marijuana could be and are now spreading awareness to educate other teenagers and students . Bryant said he knew Emily used real marijuana occasionally, and told her she would be grounded if he ever caught her smoking. 'Had I thought that there was any chance that she could have been hurt by this stuff, I would have been a lot more vigilant. I had no idea it was so bad,' Bryant told CNN. 'I'd never have thought we'd be in this situation. If she had bought it off the street or from a corner, that's one thing, but she bought it from convenience store.'

"Google has severed ties with right-wing political group, the American Legislative Exchange Council, accusing it of 'lying' about climate change. The company's chairman, Eric Schmidt, said Google had made a mistake in funding the lobby group which opposes US policies to reduce emissions. The move comes ahead of a United Nation's briefing document, to be formally unveiled this week, which attempts to persuade companies to shun climate-denying businesses. Google has severed ties with right-wing political group, the American Legislative Exchange Council, accusing it of 'lying' about climate change. The company's chairman, Eric Schmidt (pictured), said Google had made a mistake in funding the lobby group which opposes US policies to reduce emissions . The American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec) was behind the push to repeal state mandates for renewable energy use. It has also called for research councils to study beneficial effects of climate change and to examine how reducing carbon emissions may damage the economy. Schmidt told National Public Radio that the company had initially joined Alec to campaign on an unrelated issue. 'I think the consensus within the company was that that was some sort of mistake, and so we're trying to not do that in the future,' he said. Schmidt told National Public Radio that Google had initially joined Alec to campaign on an unrelated issue.'I think the consensus within the company was that that was some sort of mistake, and so we're trying to not do that in the future,' he said. On the left is a protester asking businesses to oppose Alec . The world spewed far more carbon pollution into the air last year than ever before, with emissions spurred largely by China, the United States and India. This is according to a recent report that estimated the world pumped 39.8 billion tons (36.1 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide into the air last year by burning coal, oil and gas. That is 778 million tons (706 metric tons) or 2.3 per cent more than the previous year, despite increasingly urgent warnings over the need to curb greenhouse gases. The report also said that China's per capita emissions had surpassed those of Europe for the first time, between 2013 and 2014. Experts said at current rates the 'quota' for the amount of carbon dioxide that can be released into the atmosphere without pushing the world beyond 2°C of warming could be used up within 30 years. The Global Carbon Project report claims that the world is becoming committed to 'dangerous climate change' if it continues spewing emissions at its current rate. 'The facts of climate change are not in question anymore,' he added. 'Everyone understands climate change is occurring, and the people who oppose it are really hurting our children and our grandchildren and making the world a much worse place. 'And so we should not be aligned with such people - they're just, they're just literally lying.' According to the UN, 45 major corporations it investigated belonged to lobby groups which had anti-climate views. Alec responded to the news by reiterating its position that renewable energy should expand based on consumer demand, not as a result of a government mandate. 'Alec members believe the Federal Government exerts too much control on state and local decision-making,' it said. 'Google's renewable energy commitment - as well as those found throughout private industry - is completely consistent with Alec policy because the companies in question chose renewables absent a mandate.' Microsoft cut ties with Alec in July saying affiliating with a group that is actively fighting policies that promote renewable energy was 'incongruous'.

"He was only 15 when the Great War broke out and ten days later he was aboard the cruiser HMS Monmouth, heading for the coast of Chile. But when the small naval squadron commanded by Rear-Admiral Sir Christopher Cradock met a far bigger German force at the Battle of Coronel in 1914, young naval cadet George Muir's early taste of action would be his last. Ablaze at night and crippled by enemy shells, the Monmouth was caught in the spotlight of the German cruiser Nurnberg, which was hoping she would strike her colours and surrender. A young George Muir who was just 15 when he went to war aboard the HMS Monmouth, his posthumously awarded British War Medal (right) was lost for decades before turning up at an auction last year . But instead the stricken vessel, with the Edinburgh teenager on board, turned towards the enemy – who then fired into the Monmouth until she capsized, taking all 735 souls on board to a watery grave. George's heartbroken parents Andrew and Mary received a brutally succinct telegram from the Admiralty – 'Regret that loss Monmouth with all on board must now be presumed' – and their son's posthumous British War Medal. But the precious medal passed out of the family's hands and for decades they believed it to be lost – until suddenly it turned up at an auction last year. It was purchased for a three- figure sum by London-based Royal Navy medals collector Richard Emsley, who understood it had been given up by the family. But now it will be coming home after he agreed to sell it for what he paid at auction. Muir's niece Mary Baker, 77, had heard about the sale and contacted auctioneer Dix Noonan Webb, offering to buy it back. She said: 'It was an emotional moment when I first saw the medal and saw George's name inscribed around the edge. All my family are thrilled about this.' The doomed  HMS Monmouth, a Clyde-built cruiser which was sunk at the Battle of Coronel by German vesel Nurnberg which fired on it until it capsized . The medal will now be taken by George's family to a December 8 memorial service in London, marking the centenary of the British defeat at the Battle of Coronel and the Royal Navy's subsequent victory at the Battle of the Falkland Islands. The Battle of Coronel took place on 1 November 1914 off the coast of central Chile. A Royal Navy squadron, led by Rear-Admiral Sir Christopher Cradock, were defeated by German Imperial Navy forces. Two Royal Navy armoured cruisers were destroyed and 1,570 men killed in the battle. Only three men were injured on enemy forces. It was Britain's first naval defeat since the Battle of Lake Champlain in 1812 and shock at home to the defeat led to the sending of more ships. These ships later destroyed the German naval forces  at the Battle of the Falkland Islands. The medal will then return to Edinburgh where it will remain in the care of George's great-nephew William Muir. Mr Emsley, a company director, said: 'I was drawn to this medal because George was so young. He was one of the youngest people to be killed during the First World War. 'It is a highly emotive medal. I was very surprised to hear from the family. 'I have been collecting for a long time and this has never happened to me before. But as far as I was concerned, there was no doubt that, if the family wanted it back, it should be returned to them.' A few day's after the death of former Edinburgh Academy pupil George, his father received a letter from a Mrs Brown, from Edinburgh, who had also lost a son in the war. It prompted Mr Muir to reply: 'It was most kind of you to write such a nice letter of sympathy to us about our little sailor... since the sad news came to us, we have had a letter six weeks old from the boy and it has cheered us up a little because he was so happy and getting on so well.'","Young naval cadet George Muir was aboard  doomed HMS Monmouth .

"Demand: John Lewis is offering the hijab (pictured) in its school uniform department for the first time . John Lewis is offering the hijab in its school uniform department for the first time. The headdress is to be sold in the company’s stores in London and Liverpool after it signed contracts with two schools – one which was set up to educate Muslim girls and a second that welcomes pupils from all religious communities. The hijab covers the head and chest and is worn by Muslim women after the onset of puberty as a sign of modesty in the presence  of men who are outside their immediate family. It is different from the niqab, which is a full face veil and has proved divisive in schools and public life, for example if wearers are giving evidence in court. There has been controversy over whether it is right for girls attending state schools to wear religious dress rather than the standard uniform. But the fact that a mainstream retailer is starting to stock the hijab alongside blazers and blouses is likely to be welcomed as a breakthrough by Muslim parents who have so far had to rely on specialist shops. John Lewis has won the contract to supply uniforms to the Islamia Girls’ School in north-west London, which was established in 1983 by Yusuf Islam – known as the singer Cat Stevens until his conversion to Islam in 1977. It is selling a white hijab for £9, alongside a teal blazer carrying the school badge, which costs £65, a long ankle-length grey skirt at £40, and other items. John Lewis will also be supplying the hijab as part of the uniform for Belvedere Academy in Liverpool, which is a non-denominational girls’ school with pupils  from a wide range of religious backgrounds. Its two-piece hijabs are sold for £6 each in navy or black and are available alongside a formal uniform with £40 blazers carrying the school badge. Scroll down for video .

The comprehensive has been judged ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted. John Lewis said it is simply responding to demand. A spokesman for the department store said: ‘We provide uniforms for 350 schools across the country. The school informs us of the items they want us to sell as part of their uniform list.’ Last year, former Lib Dem Home Office minister Jeremy Browne,  triggered controversy by calling  for a debate on whether women should be banned from the wearing the veil in public places such  as schools.

Above, pupils are seen at the school in Salusbury Road . He suggested Muslim girls were being pressurized into wearing the religious dress, saying: ‘We should be very cautious about imposing religious conformity on a society which has always valued freedom of expression.’ His comments were rejected by Mohammed Shafiq of the Ramadhan Foundation who said he was ‘disgusted’ by them, adding: ‘Whatever one’s religion they should be free to practise it according to their own choices.’","John Lewis is offering hijab in school uniform department for the first time .

"Mini toiletries bottles and free teabags may be considered fair game. But some hotel guests have a hard time resisting the urge to pilfer anything they can get their hands on, with robes, coat hangers, slippers and sheets being common temptations. So an intuitive hotel in Australia has employed the art of reverse psychology, listing the most coveted items on a menu, complete with prices. Scroll down for video . Warning: Before you run off with that robe, remember it will end up on your bill - at a cost of over £90 . The QT hotel group came up with a menu of 14 items, which included coffee mugs, shoe horns, coat hangers, eye masks, a cocktail shaker and bathroom glasses. The menu, entitled DESIRE, was placed in all of their suites, to remind guests that any stolen items would be appearing on their bill. Prices range from nine Australian Dollars (almost £5) for an eye mask to 175 Australian Dollars (around £96). A spokesman for the group said the menus are becoming  'increasingly becoming more and more popular'. Naughty, naughty: Bathrobes and coat hangers are some of the most common items pinched by hotel guests . A Grand piano . The hefty instrument was stolen from the Starwood Hotel Group by three people dressed in overalls, who walked into the reception and quietly rolled it out. A stuffed boar .

Twelve per cent said they took items because they felt that the hotel wasn't offering them value for money. And 15 per cent admitted to pinching things because they didn't think they'd get caught. Guests who confessed to stealing items from hotel rooms most frequently said they did so because they believed it was expected of them, the survey of 1,000 people revealed. But the largest group prepared to admit their pilfering ways were young people, with 47 per cent of 18-34-year-olds saying they stole from hotels, compared to 45 per cent of 35-54-year-olds and 37 per cent of those aged over 55.","The QT hotel group listed coveted items and placed a menu in each suite .

"When Dorothy Sims, a blonde divorcee from Nottinghamshire, met her future husband Rafaa, she was instantly smitten - but was shocked when he revealed that he felt the same way. For at 70, Dorothy was almost 50 years older than the Tunisian waiter who had caught her eye during an all-girls holiday. After a whirlwind romance, the couple married in 2007 and, to begin with, were blissfully happy together. In love: Dorothy, now 77, was smitten with Tunisian waiter Rafaa, now 28, and the couple married in 2007 . Whirlwind romance: The couple wed less than a year after meeting when Rafaa was just 21 . But after Rafaa was refused a UK visa, things began to fall apart and the couple are now divorced, while Rafaa, now 28, has relocated to Saudi Arabia. Despite her heartbreak, Dorothy says she has many happy memories of Rafaa and would do it all again if she got the chance. 'I went to Tunisia with my sister and her friends,' says Dorothy of her fateful first meeting with Rafaa in 2006. 'I'd never been very far in my life and it was very exciting. There were five of us, all single ladies having a really nice time.' While relaxing by the pool, Dorothy's sister and friends began chatting to one of the waiters and while she found him attractive, she had no idea that the feeling might be mutual. 'I didn't know all these young men chased English women,' she remembers. 'I had no idea! There was an instant attraction between me and this waiter but I never did anything, I never said anything. 'Then he sent me this little note: ""Would I like to go for a coffee?"" Out of the blue. And I said to my sister: ""Is he crackers? What does he want with an old biddy like me when there's all these young birds around?""' Despite her misgivings, Dorothy decided to go and meet him anyway - and was soon smitten. 'I knew there was a relationship brewing,' she says. 'He'd planted it in my head and I knew.' Things swiftly became serious and eventually, Rafaa invited her to meet his family, who lived in Karawan, a tiny town in the far south of Tunisia. 'They lived out in the desert,' she remembers. 'All his family lived there, everybody. Cousins, his grandmother, the lot. 'They came in droves to come and say hello to me because they'd never seen an English lady with blonde hair and blue eyes before.' Culture shock: Rafaa's home in the desert town of Karawan near Sousse was unlike anything Dorothy knew . Misgivings: Despite her concerns, the couple married and Rafaa applied for a British visa but was denied . But despite the warm welcome, cultural differences swiftly became apparent. 'His mum had made a room for us with a mattress on the floor and no door on,' she laughs. 'I didn't know how I was going to sleep there with him and I was shocked because they're Muslims and I didn't think they'd do anything like that. 'We only stayed there two days,' she adds. 'I couldn't live like that. There was no bath, no shower and the toilet was horrendous. It was a hole in the floor and you had to stand over it straddle-legged.' Despite the discomforts, Dorothy was falling more and more in love with Rafaa and found herself liking his family, despite their constant questions about whether or not the two would marry. 'When we were at his mum's, they kept saying: ""Will you marry Rafaa?"" and I said: ""Goodness me, no! No, no, no! I've got no intention of getting married."" 'I'd already been divorced 40-odd years from my first husband, who is now dead. They kept saying, ""You must think about it Dorothy"".' Deeply in love, she decided to take the plunge and the couple married in a ceremony held at a registry office in nearby Sousse. Although 21-year-old Rafaa's mother and aunt were there to see it, none of Dorothy's friends or family came to the wedding. Popular: British women are in demand with Tunisian men, although not always for the right reasons . Instead, an overjoyed Dorothy sent text messages to her relations following the ceremony and settled down to enjoy the wonderful weeks that followed. 'Age wasn't a big issue at all,' she adds. 'Well, it was, it was in the beginning, because he loves kids but we talked about adopting as well.' But while the age gap may not have mattered, their living arrangements did and disaster struck when Rafaa was denied a UK visa. 'He did want to come to England but everybody does,' says Dorothy. 'These Muslim countries aren't in the EU so they can't come here.' Weeks after applying for a UK visa in Tunis, Rafaa phoned Dorothy to tell her that his application had been turned down. 'He rang me to tell me he'd been refused entry,' she remembers. 'He was very upset. I was upset too so I applied again in England and they turned me down again.' The reason? The judge wasn't convinced the relationship would last. 'He said: ""If we allow him into England, there is no evidence that you will stay together."" New life: Rafaa has now moved to Saudi Arabia and the couple have divorced - much to Dorothy's distress . 'And I said: ""Well, there's no evidence that any marriage will stay together. It doesn't matter whether he's Tunisian or where he comes from"".' Despite her protests, the judge remained unmoved and a furious Rafaa gave Dorothy an ultimatum: If he couldn't come to the UK, then she would have to move to Tunisia. 'I didn't like that idea,' she admits. With the couple's relationship floundering and Rafaa unable to get a job in his native country, he began looking abroad, to Saudi Arabia, for work. When, after months of searching, he did indeed find work in the Gulf kingdom, the writing was on the wall for Dorothy and Rafaa's marriage. 'He said we had to divorce,' says Dorothy, sadly. 'He said he couldn't go to Saudi Arabia to work with a wife in the background. 'So I said: ""You will have to do it because I have no intention of divorcing you"". And apparently, he did but I don't know [for certain] because I have no paper work. 'When you love somebody and you've finished, it just doesn't go away,' she adds. 'The hurt doesn't go away, it's still there. I've cried buckets over this, I have, really.' Despite her heartbreak, Dorothy has no regrets and admits that she could see herself doing the same thing for a second time. 'I have lots of happy memories,' she smiles. 'He was very romantic. I had a fabulous time and I could definitely do it all again.'","Dorothy Sims, now 77, was 70 when she married second husband Rafaa .

"Following a week of speculation, and closer inspection, experts are still no closer to identifying exactly what the mystery crocodile-style object is buried in a Siberian river. Fisherman supposedly bumped into the head of the 'rock' last week, and it was apparently confirmed by scientists to be an ancient lizard or even a dinosaur. Now a video has emerged which takes a closer look at the 'remains' and several professors have told MailOnline 'it looks too good to be true and may be a hoax'. Scroll down for video . Fisherman in Siberia claim to have found remarkably intact remains of an ancient lizard (shown). They supposedly found the crocodile-like head while on a fishing trip. And when they sent photos to experts they were told it was likely a lizard or dinosaur from 150 million years ago . The discovery was made by fisherman from the Wild North Fishing Club were travelling by boat down the Ruta-Ru River in the Yamal Peninsula of northern Russia. Their boat struck something that they initially thought was a boulder, but on closer examination had a somewhat more familiar appearance. Several theories have been put forward for what this crocodile-like rock might be. So far experts have suggested the rock is about 150 million years old. The fisherman originally said that Moscow scientists informed them it was a mesosaur, but if the age is correct that would be impossible, as mesosaurs lived from 299 to 270 million years ago. According to Komsomolskaya Pravda it may have been a marine reptile called Dakosaurus-maximus, which lived 161 to 100 million years ago, although more proof will be needed. Other experts speaking to Komsomolskaya Pravda agreed that it was likely a sea lizard rather than a dinosaur. However, speaking to MailOnline several professors and experts in paleontology have expressed their skepticism that the find is genuine, and say it might be a hoax. Dr Mark Evans, Curator of Natural Sciences at Leicester Arts and Museums Service said: 'In this case it does look suspicious, especially in the way it’s poking out of the river bed. 'It’s strange that it’s so much larger than the surrounding cobbles, which would suggest that it hasn’t been transported by the river. 'If it is in its original position, then it should have been eroded away to a greater extent by the cobbles. It is also hard to judge the size of it. It does look rather as if somebody has planted it there. 'Although there is an overall impression of a skull with distinct tooth sockets, some of which have teeth in them, there would seem to be too many tooth positions for it to be Dakosaurus, but that is assuming it is real, and at the moment that is far from certain.' Club chairman Yevgeny Svitov said at the time: ‘It was hard to miss, because the boat driven by my colleague Oleg Yushkov had bumped against it. When he looked to see what it was he found this huge head.’ Following the recent inspection, Professor Sergey Gashev, head of Zoology and Ichthyology at Tyumen State University, told the Siberian Times: 'We plan to go on an expedition to the river next year with scientists from the Yamal Peninsula to prove to the world that it is not a river stone but the remains of an ancient animal.' But Eugenia Khozyainova, a senior researcher from the Shemanovsky Museum in Salekhard, was more sceptical. She said it looks like a big boulder, and there are no eye sockets nor any sign of a skull. But added 'it is just so bizarre looking.' Following the find, club chairman Yevgeny Svitov said the fishermen photographed it and when they got back they emailed the picture to the Zoological Museum of the Institute of Plant and Animal Ecology in the city of Yekaterinburg, Russia. Their scientists came back to them to say that they believed it was the fossilised remains of a lizard that had lived about 150 million years ago, reports The Siberian Times. The Institute's head Pavel Kosintsev said that it was not the first report of fossil discoveries in the region but it was the first photographic evidence that the rumours were 'true'. He said all the indications were that there is possibly a wealth of similar fossils in the area. ‘We have dispatched an expedition there to investigate the remains and secure them for future study,’ he said. ‘At this stage though it's difficult to be precise about exactly what the find shows.’ The institute is confident that the remains have significant scientific value and they are hoping to recover them before the spring thaw washes them away. However, speaking to MailOnline other experts expressed their scepticism that the find was real. ‘If it looks too good to be true, it almost certainly isn’t,’ Dr Tim Palmer of the Paleontological Association told MailOnline. The mystery object is circled in this image. Professor Sergey Gashev, head of Zoology and Ichthyology at Tyumen State University, believes it to be one of the first reptiles . ‘If it looks too good to be true, it almost certainly isn’t,’ Dr Tim Palmer of the Paleontological Association told MailOnline. ‘If it was genuine, old and reworked then it wouldn’t be in the apparently good condition that the picture tries to suggest . ‘If it was genuine, old and reworked then it wouldn’t be in the apparently good condition that the picture tries to suggest. Especially in the pebbly and erosive bed of a river. ‘My personal opinion is that someone has buried a stuffed crocodile - or even a large model - in a river bed in order to make some sort of mischief.’ And Dr Ivan Sansom, Senior Lecture in Palaeobiology at Birmingham University, agrees: ‘Finding a fossil skull in the bid of a river is entirely feasible, but it would be a very lucky find to uncover a specimen as intact as illustrated,’ he says. The discovery was made by fisherman from the Wild North Fishing Club were travelling by boat down the Ruta-Ru River in the Yamal peninsula of northern Russia (shown). Their boat struck something that they initially thought was a boulder, but on closer examination had a somewhat more familiar appearance . If true the find may have been a marine reptile called Dakosaurus-maximus (illustration shown). However speaking to MailOnline several professors expressed scepticism that the find was real and say it may be a hoax, with one saying it was 'too good to be true' Dr Richard Butler of the School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences at Birmingham University says: 'Without seeing an image of the specimen when it is not almost entirely covered with water it is impossible for me to determine if it is indeed a fossil - it may well turn out simply to be an odd shaped rock. 'What look very superficially like teeth could easily be plants growing on the rock for example! 'At this stage I don¹t think we can say anything about this and its potential scientific significance. I am skeptical as to whether it is even be a fossil.' Scientists are trying to figure out if it is a 'Dakosaurus-maximus' dating from the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, as Siberian naturalist Pavel Sitnikov argues, or a freak of nature, a rock appearing to have sharp teeth . The discovery was made by fisherman from the Wild North Fishing Club were travelling by boat down the Ruta-Ru River in the Yamal Peninsula of northern Russia . And Professor of Vertebrate Palaeontology Mike Benton from Bristol University was particularly skeptical of the veracity of the find. 'Well, what can I say. It’s a fake,' he claims. 'It looks a bit like the snout of a crocodile, maybe stuffed, maybe carved in wood, maybe fossil, set up in the pebbles on the bottom of the river and photographed as a student-style prank.' Meanwhile Professor David Martill, a Reader in Palaeobiology from the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Portsmouth says: 'The picture of the skull is unclear because of the water running over it, but first impressions suggest it is something with a long snout and pointed teeth. Thus a carnivore. It could be a bear. 'However, there is the possibility that it is is a much older fossil. 'Siberia is rich in Cretaceous strata which might contain any number of fossils reptiles from marine mosasaurs [a type of extinct marine reptile] to terrestrial dinosaurs. But he adds: 'Why on earth the guys didn't haul it out of the water to get a better view is beyond me. Perhaps it is a hoax.'","Fisherman in Siberia claim to have found remarkably intact remains of an ancient lizard .

"The Mangalyaan spacecraft successfully entered orbit around Mars this morning, making India the first Asian nation to reach the red planet. The Mars Orbiter Mission cost £45 million ($74 million), or about three-quarters the amount to make the Oscar-winning movie Gravity about astronauts stranded in space. It arrived in orbit around the red planet after a tense 300-day marathon travelling more than 420 million miles (670 million km). Scroll down for videos . Thumbs up: India's low-cost mission to Mars successfully entered the red planet's orbit on this morning. Pictured are Indian staff from the Indian Space Research Organisation celebrating the success of the mission . Just an hour after reaching the orbit, India's space agency, ISRO, received the first photographic data of the red planet’s terrain, which will be unveiled later this afternoon. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the Mars Orbiter Mission (Mom) crowned a 'near impossible' push to become the only country to complete the trip on its maiden attempt. Both Russia and the US failed their first attempts to Mars, while the Chinese mission to Mars, dubbed Yinghuo-1 mission failed in 2011 and the Japanese mission to Mars ran out of fuel. 'History has been created today,' said Modi at the state-run Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) when it was announced the mission had been accomplished. Big spenders: A comparison of how much countries have spent on their attempts to reach Mars.

Race to the red planet: The Mangalyaan spacecraft (artist's impression pictured) successfully entered orbit around Mars this morning, making India the first Asian nation to reach the red planet . Jubilant: Indian PM Narendra Modi is seen on a screen as he addresses scientists alongside a graphic of the Mars Orbiter Spacecraft, after the spacecraft successfully entered into the Mars orbit, at the Indian Space Research Organisation's Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network  in Bangalore on Wednesday . This graphic reveals the trajectory and plans for India's Mars Orbiter Mission. ISRO successfully ignited the main 440 Newton liquid engineand eight small thrusters that fired for 24 minutes and trimmedthe speed of the craft to allow smooth orbit insertion under Mars' shadow . On average, it lies 141.6 million miles from the sun. With a diameter of 4,222 miles, it’s around half the size of the Earth and has an average temperature of -85F (-65C). Gravity is much less powerful - slightly less than 40 per cent of ours. The atmosphere is desperately thin – one per cent of Earth’s pressure – and  95 per cent of it is carbon dioxide. It boasts the solar system’s biggest mountain – Olympus Mons, a dead volcano. It measures 335 miles across and rises to a height of 88,000ft, which is almost three times higher than Everest.Mars has two cosmic sidekicks – the moons Deimos and Phobos. Mars’s red colouring comes from the iron oxide that coats its surface. Mars has huge amounts of ice at its polar caps.If they melted, it would cover the whole planet in water 11-metres deep, according to Nasa. 'We have dared to reach out into the unknown and haveachieved the near impossible,' said Modi, wearing a symbolic redwaistcoat at the space command centre in the southern city of Bangalore. Modi has said he wants to expand the country's . five-decade-old space programme. With a spacecraft around Mars, India joins a small group of . nations - the United States, Russia and Europe - that have . successfully sent probes to orbit or land on Mars. ISRO successfully ignited the main 440 Newton liquid engine . and eight small thrusters that fired for 24 minutes and trimmed . the speed of the craft to allow smooth orbit insertion under . Mars' shadow. A confirmation of orbit entry was received at . around 8 a.m. India time. After completing the journey in more than 10 months, the Mangalyaan spacecraft ('Mars craft' in Hindi) will now study the red planet's surface and scan its atmosphere . for chemical methane. It will be examining Mars for methane, a key chemical in life processes on Earth that could also come from geological processes. None of the instruments will send back enough data to answer these questions definitively, but experts say the data will help them better understand how planets form and what conditions might make life possible. Scientists said it was helpful that Mangalyaan's data will reflect the same time period as data being collected by Nasa's newest Maven mission, allowing the two data sets to be compared for better understanding. The U.S. has two more satellites circling the planet at the moment, as well as two rovers rolling across the rocky Martian surface. The official Twitter account of Nasa's Curiosity Rover - which has been on the Martian surface since 2012, tweeted: 'Namaste, @MarsOrbiter! Congratulations to @ISRO and India’s first interplanetary mission upon achieving Mars orbit. Mangalyaan’s Twitter account replied: 'Howdy @MarsCuriosity ? Keep in touch. I’ll be around.' The technological triumph is fortuitously timed for Modi - . he will be able to flaunt the achievement on a trip to the . United States starting on Friday that includes an address to the . United Nations. Nasa's Curiosity Rover Twitter account tweeted a congratulations message to ISRO's Mars Orbiter, to which it replied 'Keep in touch. I'll be around' Vigilant: Indian scientists and engineers from the Indian Space Research Organisation monitor India's Mars Orbiter Mission . As India makes makes space history on Mars, Russia is hoping to do the same on the moon by 2030. The head of Roscomsos, Oleg Ostapenko, said plans were underway for a manned spacecraft to reach the moon by the end of the next decade. The system will deliver cargo and cosmonauts to the moon, and someday also into the deep space, according to Ostapenko. 'Based on the results of lunar surface exploration by unmanned space probes, we will designate [the] most promising places for lunar expeditions and lunar bases,' Ostapenko said. 'The success of our space programme is a shining symbol of . what we are capable of as a nation. Our space programme has been . an example of achievement,' said the nationalist prime minister. Modi also holds the additional charge as India's minister of . space, and in June endorsed the low-cost of the project, saying . it cost even less than the budget 'Gravity'. The Hollywood . blockbuster cost about $100 million to make. India’s Mars, however, has faced some criticism by critics, who have said the country could not afford to indulge in such a mission when a third of the population have no access to electricity. The country's space programme was launched in the early . 1960s and India developed its own rocket technology after . Western powers imposed sanctions for a nuclear weapons test in . 1974. Still, the country remains a small player in the global space industry that grew to £191 billion ($314 billion) in revenues and government budgets in 2013. Experts say Mars mission success can help change that. 'ISRO will now hopefully attract a lot of business,' said Mayank Vahia, a scientist at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. With 30 Indian and 40 foreign satellite launches so far, its nearest cheap competition would be China, which is armed with bigger space launchers. ISRO signed an agreement with China National Space Administration on Friday to cooperate in research and development of various satellites.

"Two Austrian sisters have disappeared from their home in Vienna in what authorities fear could be the latest case of teenagers going to fight for ISIS in Syria. The girls, named only as Violetta, 17, and Viktoria, 16, due to Austrian privacy laws, have not been seen since 11pm on Saturday, and their mother fears they could have gone abroad to join Islamists. If her fears are correct, then the girls will follow in the footsteps of Samra Kesinovic, 17, and her friend Sabina Selimovic, 15, who became poster girls for jihad after going to Syria in April. Sisters Violetta, 17 (left), and Viktoria, 16, may have become the latest set of Austrian girls to escape abroad and join ISIS after they disappeared from Vienna on Saturday . Setaniye, the mother of the latest pair to vanish, said the girls' father died last year from cancer and they had turned to religion in order to cope. She added: 'The two seemed to have been taking some comfort from religion but I was worried lately that they appeared to be getting a bit extreme. 'They were acting a bit strange but as a single mum I was always so busy perhaps I didn't pay as much attention as I should. 'I last saw them at the weekend when they said they were going to the shops and they never came back. They should only have been gone a few minutes but when an hour had gone past I worried, and when I looked there was no sign of them.' She said that her initial concerns turned into panic when she checked the girls' rooms and found the both of them had taken their passports. The 46-year-old mother added: 'Going back over their behaviour now over the last few weeks I'm convinced and terrified that they may have travelled to Syria to join ISIS.' If the sisters have travelled to Syria, then they will follow in the footsteps of friend Sabina Selimovic, 15 (pictured), and Samra Kesinovic, 17, who also fled Vienna earlier this year . Sabina (left) and Samra (right) became known as the poster girls for jihad after their social media accounts were used to spread ISIS propaganda after they fled to join the Islamists . Fellow teenagers Samra and Sabina disappeared in April, leaving notes for their parents which read: 'Don’t look for us. We will serve Allah – and we will die for him'. Since then their social media accounts have been used to pump out pro-Islamic State propaganda aimed at encouraging others to join them. The pair are thought to have been married to Chechen rebels as soon as they arrived in Syria, and are both now believed to be pregnant. Security sources reported earlier this month that both of the youngsters had been in contact saying they regretted their decision and wanted to return home, but were told it may not be possible. This claim had reportedly infuriated ISIS leaders who are waging a constant propaganda war in order to lure young, impressionable people to their cause. According to anti-terrorism police in the girls' homeland, it is almost certain that they would have been ordered to retract anything they had said to keep the flow of recruits coming. Sabina (left) and Samra (right), began posting images of their new lives abroad in an attempt to get other girls to join them, and now authorities fear Viktoria and Violetta may have done exactly that . An Austrian security insider said: 'If they really want it to be believable that the girls are now claiming they don't want to come home, they should let them give the interview on neutral territory where it's possible to see that they aren't being threatened by a gun. 'If the claim they want to come home is untrue, they have the opportunity to walk back into Syria.' Meanwhile Setaniye has filed a complaint with Austrian police to say that her daughters are missing, but police and the Austrian Interior Ministry have so-far declined to comment . However, an insider said the disappearance was a cause for concern, and was being investigated.","Sisters Viktoria, 16, and Violetta, 17, have disappeared from home in Vienna .

"Ginger-haired Australian jihadist Abdullah Elmir, 17, has been condemned by his relatives over a chilling video in which he declares ISIS will not stop their murderous campaign 'until the black flag is flying high in every single land'. In a propaganda video for the terror group published on YouTube, the young white, Sydney born man calling himself Abu Khaled from Australia is flanked by other ISIS fighters. Elmir reportedly told his mother he was 'going fishing' when he disappeared from his home in Bankstown, west Sydney, in June. Elmir and his friend Feiz are believed to have made their way to Syria and Iraq after crossing the border from Turkey, where they were last known to have contacted family members. They travelled via Perth, with stops in Malaysia and Thailand. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Abu Khaled frrom Australia, thought to be Abdullah Elmir, speaks flanked by other ISIS fighters in the latest ISIS propaganda video . Sydney teen Abdullah Elmir reportedly told his mother he was 'going fishing' when he disappeared from his home in Bankstown in June . 'What a stupid idiot,' an unnamed relative told the Daily Telegraph. 'We never associated with him, that guy was brainwashed, I don't know what these kids get into.' 'They don't know how to fight... they should be getting an education and building this country up.' He begins the video by saying 'this message I deliver to you the people of America, this message I deliver to you the people of Britain and this message I deliver especially to you the people of Australia'. Titled 'Message Of The Mujahid 4', the video which is 1.43 minutes long is full of heavily worded threats and taunts the US-led coalition that recently began air strikes on ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq. 'I say this about your coalition: you threaten us with your countries, bring every nation that you wish to us, bring every nation that you want to come and fight us. Whether it's 50 nations or 50 thousand nations it means nothing to us,' Elmir says. Reading from a script, a black and white scarf wrapped around his head and a huge rifle in his hand, he warns: 'Bring your planes bring everything you want to use because it will not harm us because we have Allah which is something you do not have.' A spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Abbott said: 'This video again highlights the threat posed by ISIL.' 'As the Prime Minister has said on many occasions, ISIL is a threat that reaches out to Australia and our allies and partners.' Elmir's family told the Sydney Morning Herald in June they were devastated their son had been 'brainwashed'. Titled 'Message Of The Mujahid 4', the 1.43 minutes long video is full of threats against the west . Bearded ISIS fighters, holding rifles, flank the Australian jihadi as he preaches hate . As he finishes his diatribe the men all cheer and chant in Arabic . His family's lawyer Zali Burrows told the Australian Associated Press: 'The family went to the media today as a plea to the government to bring their boy back. 'We know they have the intelligence to pinpoint him. 'The concern is that he’s being used as a tracking device to gather further intelligence, to see where he's actually going to go.' Ms Burrows questioned how Elmir  was not stopped by Federal Police, who were thought to be monitoring him. On Sunday, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop announced Australia will send its special forces into Iraq to fight against Islamic State. Elmir's video was published one day after the announcement. 'Is it not apparent to you how are these victories possible?,' he asks. 'It comes only from Allah and that is why these small numbers of soldiers that we have we take these massive victories. 'And to the leaders to the Obama, to Tony Abbott, I say to you this: these weapons that we have, these soldiers will not stop fighting, we will not put down our weapons until we reach your lands, until we take the head of every tyrant and until the black flag is flying high in every single land.' Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf is wanted by the Federal Police for his activities in Syria . Former Sydney boxer Mohamed Elomar posted photos of himself holding up decapitated heads on Twitter . The jihadist goes on to claim that ISIS are going to put a 'black flag on top of Buckingham Palace' and the White House. 'We will keep on fighting and we will fight you and defeat you,' he states. As his hate-filled diatribe finishes he begins chanting in Arabic and the fighters around him join in. Monash University terror expert Professor Greg Barton said Abu Khaled was an unknown quantity. 'The big thing is this is the third time Australia's been clearly in the frame,' Prof Barton said. A month ago, Islamic State spokesman Abu Mohammad Al-Adnani urged his followers to murder people of a number of nationalities, including Australians. 'Smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him,' Al-Adnani said. Ten days ago, the Islamic State's official magazine, Dabiq, also singled out Australians. 'At this point of the crusade against the Islamic State, it is very important that attacks take place in every country that has entered into the alliance against the Islamic State, especially the US, UK, France, Australia and Germany,' it said. On October 10, a young Australian named Abu Ousama, working as a combat medic for a terror group in Syria, said he is still a 'true blue Aussie' despite condoning the brutal beheadings by ISIS . In this photo a member loyal to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) waves an ISIL flag in Raqqa . Prime Minister Tony Abbott explained on Wednesday that 200 members of the Australian special forces had been waiting in the United Arab Emirates since mid-September to take on ISIS because Baghdad had not offered them formal legal protections. And Australia launched their first air strikes against Islamic State targets inside the country earlier this month as part of the U.S.-led coalition. There are thought to be over 100 Australians fighting with ISIS in the Middle East, including Sydney-born friends Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar. Sharrouf and Elomar have repeatedly taunted the authorities on social media with photos of alleged beheadings of Syrian soldiers. And on October 10, a young Australian named Abu Ousama, working as a combat medic for a terror group in Syria, said he is still a 'true blue Aussie' despite condoning the brutal beheadings by ISIS. Ousama is living among rebel fighters for Jund al-Aqsa. He took part in an interview broadcast on 7News by British photojournalist Tam Hussain who lived with the 1000 strong Islamic battalion group, which is independent of ISIS but supports their ideology. 'ISIS have taken this role of protecting the innocent Muslims of this country, of this land. 'So, they have to do what they need to do to make their state,' he said.

"These shocking photographs show how Syrian rebels have resorted to building dangerous makeshift weapons in their attempt to overthrow president Bashar Al-Assad. Although the opposition has begun to smuggle in weapons on a larger scale, the distribution of them is reportedly still unorganised.

A makeshift trebuchet was created from planks of wood and used to fire missiles into enemy territory. Earlier this week the U.S congress gave permission to the Obama Administration to send military items to the less extreme rebels. But, the House of Commons voted by 114 to one to ensure that the UK cannot send weapons without putting it to a parliamentary vote. The head of Syria's opposition told U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday the country's situation was 'desperate' and called for the United States to arm the rebels quickly and to push harder for a political settlement.

The three chief distinguishing characteristics of a trebuchet are: . The rebels have adopted methods and weapons used in the making of both trebuchets and catapults. The United Nations says more than 100,000 people have been killed since Syria's civil war erupted more than two years ago pitting President Bashar al-Assad's forces against rebels seeking to end his family's four-decade rule. President Barack Obama, having withdrawn U.S. troops from Iraq and seeking to wind up the U.S. war in Afghanistan, has been reluctant to get involved in the conflict in Syria. However, U.S. congressional panels this month agreed to a White House plan to provide arms to the rebels despite lawmakers' questions about its chances of success and concerns the arms might be used against Western targets. A U.S. official has said funding for . the classified program runs out on September 30, when the U.S. fiscal . year ends. That means the White House will have to seek Congress' blessing again for arming the rebels, the official said, possibly . setting up a renewed confrontation over Washington's policy on Syria. 'The .

"A spooked carriage horse caused a commotion in downtown Savannah, Georgia, Monday afternoon, sending the coach operator to the hospital and damaging five parked cars. Savannah Chatham Metropolitan police say the buggy, operated by Historic Savannah Carriage Tours, was carrying two women, ages 42 and 67, and three children, ages 12, 10 and 7, from Sleepy Hollow, New York, when the horse pulling the coach began running. The driver, 37-year-old Ashley Bignault, was ejected from the vehicle and was later hospitalized with a broken heel. Scroll down for video . Running wild: A surveillance camera in downtown Savannah, Georgia, captured a carriage drawn by an out-of-control horse careening into parked cars in the city's historic center . Startled: A horse named Oscar carrying five people in the buggy got spooked after losing its bit . The 67-year-old female passenger was treated at a nearby urgent care center and released. The incident spanned six city blocks and nearby restaurant employees eventually calmed the horse down with carrots, department spokesman Julian Miller said. Police say the horse that caused the commotion wasn't injured. The animal was identified as a young Percheron gelding named Oscar. The incident took place just before 12.30pm Monday as a horse pulling a buggy with five tourists from New York in downtown Savannah broke into a gallop after losing its bit at Bryan and Barnard streets. According to police, the bridle then became dislodged, making it difficult to control the frightened animal. Unstoppable: The horse and carriage were described by witnesses as a pin ball bouncing off cars . Hanging by a thread: The horse's bridle became dislodged, making it difficult for driver Ashley Bignault (pictured) to control the animal . A surveillance video of the incident shows the horse running to the south side of Ellis Square and turning to Congress Street, with the coach slamming into the sides of five cars before the driver, Ashley Bignault, is ejected. Witnesses described the horse and buggy bouncing off parked cars ‘like a pin ball,’ The Augusta Chronicle reported. ‘I heard the horse coming down and said it sounds like it’s going awfully fast for in the city, or for a tour,’ eyewitness Aaron Senne told the station WSAV. ‘I turned around, could see the horse galloping. Hit with its full chest on the side of the Nissan.’ The out-of-control horse eventually made its way to Congress Lane, where employees from a nearby restaurant were able to stop it just short of Bull Street. According to the website of Historic Savannah Carriage Tours, the company owns nine horses and six carriages. Heroic: After the horse ejected the driver, employees from a nearby restaurant were able to stop it and rescue its terrified passengers . On the website, Oscar is described as 'the baby of the barn' known for his speed and voracious appetite, which at times drives him to 'sneak towards the edge of the street while on tour to grab a snack off a nearby tree of bush.' Local officials told the station WJCL that the tour operator has a clean safety record. Bignault has been with the company for six years. Owner John Tarr described what happened Monday as ‘just an unfortunate accident.’ Nicole and Charles Miller, who were in Savannah on their honeymoon, said the harrowing ordeal has made them think twice about getting into a horse-drawn carriage for a romantic outing. ‘We were thinking of going on one of those rides. Not now,’ said Mr Miller.","Historic Savannah Carriage Tours operator Ashley Bignault, 37, suffered a broken heel when a horse named Oscar threw her .

"A holiday usually spells frenetic excitement from a family's younger members. But a London hotel is now offering a counter balance to over-hyped nippers - with Etiquette Workshops, designed to teach them good old-fashioned  good manners. The prestigious Jumeirah Carlton Tower in Knightsbridge has joined forces with children's clothing brand Catiouche to give visitors to the capital the chance to instill some etiquette into their offspring. The prestigious Jumeirah Carlton Tower has joined forces with children's brand Catoiuche to offer the classes . Lana Berglas, the founder of Catiouche, along with Taryn Jahme - a qualified International Etiquette Trainer with 14 years of experience, will host intimate workshops. The idea is to encourage children to build positive relationships within their communities, schools, social situations and within the home environment. They will educate children on key life skills, such as the importance of exercise, nutrition, dining and social etiquette and grooming. Education: Kids will be taught  the importance of exercise, nutrition, dining and social etiquette and grooming .

The workshops will be open to children aged between three and 13 and the ultimate intention is for participants to grow into confident, considerate individuals with the necessary social tools for a successful future. It's a world away from building sandcastles. Through interactive games and role-playing, the children will assimilate important social skills concepts and behaviour ‘dos’ and ‘don’ts’ while having fun with their peers. The Jumeirah Carlton Tower is renowned for its sophistication - but can that rub off on it's younger guests? Children will learn confidence.  Picture shows children taking part in a previous event organised by Catiouche . According to Berglas: 'In our technologically-driven society we are rediscovering the lost art of etiquette and, whilst communication has become global, human interaction still has its place and the relevant social proficiency seems to be neglected in schools and, unfortunately, even in the family environment.' Meanwhile, parents will be welcome to unwind and enjoy a delicious Sunday lunch at The Rib Room Bar & Restaurant whilst their children take part in the workshop. First class nannies, provided by Perfect Household Staff, will also be on hand to supervise the children whilst Lana and Taryn lead the demonstrations.

"A former West Point cadet has lost a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against members of R&B singer Patti LaBelle's entourage whom he accused of beating him as he waited for a ride outside a Houston airport terminal. In his lawsuit, Richard King alleged he was attacked without provocation by LaBelle's bodyguard and two others while waiting outside Bush Intercontinental Airport in 2011. King had just arrived in Houston, his hometown, while on spring break from West Point. After five days of testimony and 10 hours of deliberation, a federal jury in Houston on Tuesday night absolved Zuri Edwards, LaBelle's manager and son; Efrem Holmes, her bodyguard; and Norma Harris, her hairdresser. She won: Soul singer Patti LaBelle arrives at the federal courthouse for jury selection September 16. in Houston. A former West Point cadet has lost a lawsuit he filed against LaBelle and her entourage saying she ordered her bodyguards to beat him up as he waited for a ride home outside a Houston airport terminal in 2011 . LaBelle, 70, had been dropped from the suit early in the trial. John Raley, one of King's lawyers, told jurors that King was minding his own business outside the airport terminal when he was attacked without provocation by the 400-pound Holmes, as well as by Edwards and Harris. Raley said King had to drop out of West Point because of a traumatic brain injury he suffered when he hit his head on a concrete pillar during the attack. Geoffrey Bracken, one of LaBelle's attorneys, told jurors that King was the aggressor who first punched Edwards. LaBelle's attorneys have said King hurled racial insults at the singer before he attacked her son and that King was told several times to step away from the singer's vehicle after he tried to open a passenger door. Bracken blamed King's drinking for the incident and suggested that King's career at West Point was ended not by his injuries but by a previous history of poor academic performance. Raley said King had a blood alcohol level of 0.28 - more than three times the legal limit for driving - but that King was not driving and was no danger to anyone. Jurors viewed surveillance video of the brawl that included Labelle posing for a fan photo with a police officer beside a puddle of King's blood. LaBelle, whose singing career has spanned more than four decades and includes several hit records and two Grammy Awards, took the stand for about 30 minutes last week. She testified that she rolled down the window in her limousine to ask her bodyguard if all of their luggage had arrived since the flight had been delayed for over an hour, not to give instructions to assault King, as the plaintiff alleged. In his lawsuit, Richard King (seen in yellow here in surveillance footage) alleged he was attacked without provocation by LaBelle's bodyguard and two others while waiting outside Bush Intercontinental Airport in 2011. King had just arrived in Houston, his hometown, while on spring break from West Point . Lost: King claimed he suffered irreparable brain injury from the altercation and subsequently had to drop out of West Point, but a jury didn't see it his way . Distubing: Jurors viewed surveillance video of the brawl that included Labelle posing for a fan photo with a police officer beside a puddle of King's blood . 'I take pictures with anyone and everyone who asks': An attorney for King asked whether LaBelle's posing for photographs with the officers could have influenced the investigation into the melee . The singer said she did not see what happened after King punched her son, Zuri Edwards, who is also her manager. 'After seeing my son beat up, I didn't want to look any more,' LaBelle said when she was asked to explain why she didn't see the whole incident. A Harris County jury acquitted LaBelle's bodyguard, Efrem Holmes, of charges stemming from the melee in 2013. An attorney for King asked whether LaBelle's posing for photographs with the officers could have influenced the investigation into the melee. 'It could have been a homeless person, dear. I take pictures with anyone and everyone who asks,' LaBelle replied. LaBelle said she heard King use a racial slur, but that words, even if offensive, did not warrant a physical attack. 'I've been doing this for 52 years and I've heard all kinds of things and I don't react,' LaBelle said.","The legendary diva had been dropped from the suit over the 2011 Houston airport altercation .

"The Proposers, Daisy Amodio (left) with Tiffany Wright (right) When millionaire property developer Nick Candy popped the question to actress Holly Valance three years ago, little did he know he was helping to unleash a side unheard of in the British male: the hopeless romantic. His proposal - on a beach in the Maldives with the words, 'Will you marry me' written in fire - suddenly became the benchmark against which all proposals would be judged. It was also the proposal that changed the lives of two friends - Tiffany Wright and Daisy Amodio. Walking through Hyde Park one day, they spotted a chap who, hoping to pull off a Candy-style proposal yet lacking the funds, had armed himself with dozens of tea lights with which he spelt out, . 'Make me the happiest man in the world' for his girlfriend. 'It was lovely,' says Tiffany, 'except it was so windy the lights kept blowing out and he'd misspelled “happiest”. So we helped him out. When he said, ""I don't know what I'd have done without you,"" a light bulb went off in our heads.' That moment two years ago led to Tiffany, 33, and Daisy, 32, setting up The Proposers - Britain's first bespoke marriage proposal company. Their exploits are captured in a new series which follows men as they try to come up with the most poignant proposal to spring on their girlfriend. The chaps, largely, look terrified, the women shell-shocked, and it all makes for highly entertaining TV. 'Before it was fine for men to go down on one knee,' says Daisy, a former advertising executive, 'but people want more of a story now. They want to tell their mates about how they did something a bit crazy.' That's one way to describe 35-year-old property investor Peter Agate's proposal to girlfriend Cloe. Having been given a blank cheque, the Proposers organise a Chanel dress and Mulberry bag to be delivered, before a trip by Ferrari, speedboat and helicopter to a chapel where Peter waits with a gospel choir to sing the Keira Knightley wedding scene from Cloe's favourite film, Love Actually. Noah proposes to Naomi with a flash mob on London's Hungerford Bridge . 'He said Cloe wanted to know what it felt like to be a celebrity,' says Tiffany. Other proposals are more simple. Noah, a 23-year-old actor-director, pops the question to his girlfriend Naomi on London's Hungerford Bridge with a flash mob of singers performing Bruno Mars's Just The Way You Are. Some men simply need saving from themselves. 'One guy wanted to take his girlfriend to a restaurant, excuse himself and then return dressed as the Beast from Beauty And The Beast and sing her a song from the movie,' says Tiffany. 'We asked him if his girlfriend would like it and he said, ""No, she's really shy."" Then we asked if she liked Beauty And The Beast and he said no, but it was his favourite film, and when we asked him if he could even sing, he said, “Not really, I'm terrible.” Luckily, we managed to persuade him to propose over a picnic in Hyde Park instead.'

"Lilly-May Allen was playing with a friend on a grid she had chalked on the pavement in front of her home when a marked police van pulled up to warn he she could be arrested . A girl aged ten was told by police that she could be arrested for causing criminal damage – over a game of hopscotch. Lilly-May Allen was playing with a friend on a grid she had chalked on the pavement in front of her home when a marked police van pulled up. An officer warned the girls that using chalk on the pavement was criminal damage and they could be arrested for it, before driving off. But the girls did not understand what they had done wrong and Lilly-May is now reluctant to play outside, according to her father. After Lilly-May told her parents about the incident, they called the police to clarify the law, but officers refused to confirm whether drawing a hopscotch grid in chalk on the pavement was an offence – even though it washes away in the rain. The girl’s father, Bob Allen, 51, who runs his own karaoke business, said: ‘The policeman said to her that what she had done was criminal damage and she could be arrested. He then drove off. ‘She didn’t come into the house for a while and didn’t tell us  straight away because she  thought I was going to tell her off for being naughty. ‘She couldn’t even remember what the policeman had told her it was – only criminal something.’ He added: ‘She is only ten and didn’t know what she had done wrong. 'I rang up the police and asked if chalking up a hopscotch grid was an offence and they wouldn’t say yes or no and said it was a grey area. ‘I’m angry and upset and if it was against the law then the policeman should have knocked on our door and said something.’ Mr Allen, who lives in a three-bedroom semi-detached home in Ramsgate, Kent, said the  incident on Monday had knocked his daughter’s confidence about playing outside. Lilly-May did not understand what she did wrong and is now reluctant to play outside, according to her father . He added: ‘Lilly-May is very dubious about going out to play now in case a policeman tells her off. She’s started playing with her friend in our car in the drive instead.’ Lilly-May said yesterday: ‘It was a bit silly and I really didn’t know why I was in trouble. I’m still going to play hopscotch outside though.’ Her father has now given her the nickname ‘Banksy’, after the Bristolian graffiti artist whose stunts have adorned public buildings across the world, to try to make her feel less worried. A Kent Police spokesman  said: ‘We are trying to trace the officers who are reported to have made this comment. Bob Allen, who lives in a three-bedroom semi-detached home in Ramsgate, Kent, said the  incident on Monday had knocked his daughter's confidence about playing outside . ‘From the circumstances described, it would not appear to have been necessary to advise the young girl that chalking a hopscotch grid may be criminal damage and illegal.’ Last month the country’s first youth police and crime commissioner resigned her post before starting work at the same force after violent, homophobic and racist messages that she had written on the internet were revealed. The 'scotch' part of the game's name means ‘an incised line or scratch’. Hopscotch was first recorded in England in the Book of Games – which was compiled between 1635 and 1672 – where it is referred to as ‘scotch-hopper’. But historians believe it was widely played across the country centuries before. The game involves children throwing a coin or stone into the grid and hopping from box to box in a set pattern to retrieve the object. Many school playgrounds have hopscotch grids marked into the concrete, but they can also be chalked on stone or scratched into dirt.

"If you want to know what Amsterdammers are really like, you could do a lot worse than chat to Iris. There she was, a little girl on a stool in grassy Vondelpark. It was King’s Day, the Saturday in April when the city turns orange because everyone’s just happy to be Dutch. Later in the day there is music, dancing and vast amounts of drink. But King’s Day morning belongs to the children, encouraged by parents everywhere to learn the Dutch habits of entrepreneurship: playing music, selling old toys, making cakes – doing what it takes to earn money, because when they grow up that’s what the Dutch do. Iris sat there with her crayons and easel and offered to sketch a quick portrait for 50 cents. But, as her portfolio proudly demonstrated, she couldn’t draw for toffee. All she had were funny, childlike scribbles. Hugely individual: Author David Hewson says to find the real Amsterdam simply venture out of the city centre . The King’s Day crowds simply laughed, queued up for a truly terrible likeness, then gave her a whole euro for her cheek. Forget coffee shops, the sleaze and tourist tat with clogs and tulips. This is the real Amsterdam, a bright, funny, extraordinarily human place with odd local customs and a huge sense of individual identity. To find it, all you have to do is walk away from the centre. Historic Amsterdam, that old part you first see when you turn up at Centraal Station, may have its monuments but it’s also the most tawdry and overcrowded part of the city. The real city, the place of painters and poets and dreamers, lies elsewhere, in the watery girdle known as the Canal Rings, the elegant Museum District, and the Jordaan, the old working-class area turning into one of the chic-est parts of town. Here you realise it’s impossible to separate Amsterdam from the written word: Anne Frank penned her memoirs in a little house on the Prinsengracht canal, hiding from the Nazis; John Green’s fated lovers in The Fault In Our Stars brave the perpetual tedious queue for the cramped museum her house has now become. People relax by the famous canal of Amsterdam, a city far more elegant and chic than it's given credit for . An extraordinary doll’s house in the Rijksmuseum lies at the heart of Jessie Burton’s The Miniaturist. The same object is an obsession for the Amsterdam detective Pieter Vos in my crime story The House Of Dolls. Here, then, are my top five sights for a lazy, pleasurable break that combines sightseeing with a taste for the real city… . Once rough and working class, as depicted in this work, Neighborhood in the Jordaan by George Hendrik Breitner, Jordaan is trendy and bustling . Dawdling in the Jordaan . Pieter Vos popped into my imagination a few years ago as I was sipping a beer in the De Eland cafe – reimagined in the book as the Drie Vaten – watching the world go by. That’s what you do in the Jordaan. Once a rough working-class area, its narrow streets now house a bustling and increasingly trendy community of small cafes, and scores of tiny, busy restaurants. Stand outside De Eland, on the Berenstraat Bridge over the Prinsengracht, and you see what real Amsterdam life is like. Boats large and small shuttle up and down the canals. In winter the locals pop into a little shop at the Elandsgracht end to feast on stampotje, a kind of Dutch bubble-and-squeak. In summer the same shop transforms itself, with that typical Amsterdam sense of business, into an ice-cream parlour. There are bikes everywhere, of course – on the pavement, in the road, some with dogs in shopping baskets up front; a habit my Amsterdam detective follows too. From here you can walk to the Anne Frank house in five minutes, if you want to spend the next hour in a queue. I’ve never made it inside. My local friends spend their time in De Negen Straatjes, the Nine Streets that make up the city’s most interesting shopping district, where you can buy everything from gourmet cheese to designer clothes. The old Jordaan hasn’t gone entirely, though. Ask for a music cafe and you’ll still find places where locals sing ‘the Dutch blues’ – folk music – of an evening. The tunes are an acquired taste but the experience of being there among a beery bar of singers is something you won’t find anywhere else. The wonder of the Begijnhof . This is a busy, brash city but hidden away in its heart is a quiet oasis of extraordinary calm. The Begijnhof is a courtyard of ancient houses tucked behind the bustle of Spui Square (pronounced ‘Spow’, as in ‘cow’, by the way). This was a community for single Catholic women, and walking into it is like shrugging off the centuries. The last member of the ‘Beguines’, a lay Catholic female order, died in 1971 but it’s still a place reserved for single women, so do treat with care. See the charming little chapel too, then step back out into the real world. The Begijnhof courtyard of ancient houses is an oasis of calm away from the brash city . Culture at the Rijksmuseum . A 15-minute walk away is one of the greatest museums in the world, now reopened after long closure for refurbishment. The doll’s house of Petronella Oortman, which features in both The House Of Dolls and The Miniaturist, is just one of many famous exhibits. Perhaps the best-known is Rembrandt’s vast canvas, The Night Watch. There’s often a queue so buy your ticket in advance through your hotel or through the museum at rijksmuseum.nl/en/tickets. Don’t expect to see everything: the place is much too big for that. Stick with the big sights, the paintings and dolls’ houses, and leave the rest for another time. Petronella Oortman's dolls house at the Rijksmueum in Amsterdam features in Hewson's The House of Dolls . Amsterdam’s Schiphol is one of the busiest airports in the world, with services from many UK main and regional airports by KLM, British Airways and easyJet, among others. You can also get fast trains from London St Pancras to Centraal Station via Brussels Midi on Eurostar and Thalys in less than five hours. Banks Mansion is a handsome boutique hotel on the Herengracht canal, within walking distance of the centre, the museum district and the Jordaan. Staff are happy to book museum tickets and local transport. Rooms start at £150 per night for two and include breakfast and a selection of drinks and snacks throughout the day. Ambassade Hotel is set in a number of old houses along the Herengracht. From about €200 a night, this is the place where authors generally stay in Amsterdam and has a small library full of signed copies to prove it. Hotel Weichmann is one of the few hotels in the Jordaan. Set on the Prinsengracht, it’s a small and popular family-run hotel with rooms from about £103 a night. De Oude Kerk – and red lights . Most visitors to Amsterdam will wander into the red-light district out of sheer curiosity. The narrow streets are mostly safe day and night – just don’t try to take pictures of the women working in the windows. We don’t know exactly where Petronella Oortman lived but we are sure it was in Warmoesstraat, a very old and narrow thoroughfare that runs from near Centraal Station all the way to busy Dam Square. It’s well worth a walk for the odd pretty view and the old-fashioned fish and cheese shops that work next to the more modern establishments. The 13th Century Oude Kerk is the oldest building in the city. It’s massive and not exactly elegant, but interesting, with a quiet cafe and garden. Coffee shops, sex parlours and other louche establishments line the neighbouring streets, but the canals are still pretty. Walk on to Zeedijk, then up to the smart open square of Nieuwmarkt and you’ve left the red-light district behind. A coffee at the old city gatehouse of the Waag here is a pleasant stop. Rembrandt knew this place, and his famous gory canvas The Anatomy Lesson depicts a real-life dissection of an executed criminal that took place in the anatomy theatre – now closed – at the top of the Waag. A taste of the real Holland . Edam and Gouda are genuine Dutch cheeses, but the real thing is a lot less bland than the varieties most of us experience in the UK. Food in Amsterdam is incredibly varied, from local to French, Italian and many Indonesian restaurants offering Rijsttafel, elaborate banquets of tiny dishes. Dutch Edam and Gouda cheeses taste far richer than the bland versions we're so often served up . Some of the best food is cheap, simple and available on the street. Amsterdammers adore chips and will queue patiently for a cone at their favourite friteshuis, soaked in a piquant sauce. Cheese shops often make delicious sandwiches on the spot – try Kaashuis Tromp in Elandsgracht for some of the best freshly cooked cheese croissants you’ll ever taste. On Saturdays the Jordaan area around Lindengracht and neighbouring Noordermarkt are taken over with market stalls from all over Holland selling a wonderful selection of cheese, fish, bread, fruit and home-made produce. If you really want to go local, try one of the herring stalls in the street. The taste of fresh salty fish and sharp onion – in a bread bun if you must – will remind you of this charming and often misunderstood city for ever.

"Militants who stormed the Kenyan shopping mall reportedly burnt victims' faces and cut off their hands in an attempt to conceal their identities before piling the bodies up by the main door to slow the progress of the rescue teams. One security officer said the mall had been turned into ‘an abattoir’ within half an hour as gunmen went on the rampage.

Details of the incident were posted hundreds of times on Facebook. The . woman is said to have been able to speak several times with her . husband, who is outside the shopping centre – but last night he had . heard nothing from her for several hours. Kenya's foreign minister Amina Mohamed said up to three Americans and one British person were among those who attacked the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi. He told PBS' 'NewsHour' program that the Americans were 18 to 19 years old, of Somali or Arab origin and lived 'in Minnesota and one other place' in the U.S. The revelation would support information posted onto Twitter, which suggested the terror cell which carried out the attack was 15-strong and contained many nationalities, including citizens of the United States. The attacker from Britain was a woman who has 'done this many times before,' Mohamed said which lends weight to speculation that the so-called 'White Widow', Samantha Lewhwaite may have taken part in the raid.

Four thunderous explosions reverberated through a neighborhood, raising fears for the lives of any remaining hostages still being held by al-Shabab, a Somali group linked with Al Qaeda, in the mall. Three attackers had been killed in the latest fighting and more than 10 suspects arrested. Eleven Kenyan soldiers were wounded. By evening, Kenyan security officials were claiming the upper hand. The massacre began on Saturday shortly before midday local time. Witnesses . told how terrorists with faces hidden by Islamic scarves stormed the . building, tossing grenades and spraying shoppers with AK-47s. The . killers, who were dressed in Western clothes, ordered all Muslims to . leave, before carrying out rudimentary tests to see if hostages could . recite the Koran and name the mother of the Prophet Mohammed.","Militants piled bodies up by main door to slow progress of rescue teams .

"ISIS extremists have cancelled all classes except religious studies in Syrian schools - with even the two-times table banned in its new curriculum.

"They are moments of simple joy, showing a young family at play and providing a touching insight into the warmth that infused the childhood of Prince Charles and Princess Anne. In one image from previously unseen royal home movies the two young royals are seen dancing in their bathing towels across a beach in Norfolk. In another amusing scene the Queen is seen waving on her two eldest children as they cycle in convoy with Prince Philip – who’s mounted on a bike that’s way too small for him. Scroll down to watch the Queen's home video footage . Bopping on the beach: Prince Charles and Princess Anne dance in their towels while on holiday in Norfolk . Buried: Anne (left) and Charles (right) lie in the sand with only their heads and arms showing . Closer look: Anne (left) and Charles (right) play together on the sand . In other images Charles sits at the wheel of his toy car and stands in his riding gear by his pony. There’s no footage of Her Majesty bathing the children with her crown on, but Prince Charles assures us that she did just that. The footage was last night shown on the BBC programme A Jubilee Tribute To The Queen By The Prince Of Wales, giving a rare glimpse into some of Her Majesty’s most deeply personal moments. Family bike ride: Princess Margaret waves as Anne, Philip and Charles cycle away. The Duke grins as his bicycle is much too small for him . Going places: Charles sits at the wheel of his toy car, complete with 'L' plate, while Anne plays the role of pedestrian . Pit stop: The hubcaps on Charles's toy car gleam as the heir to the throne takes a drive . The inclusion of the home movies in the documentary was seen as a gesture by the Royal Family to allow greater public insight into the private life of the monarch. The Prince pays a son’s loving tribute to what he calls his mother’s ‘natural grace’. Making a cameo appearance at one point is Winston Churchill, 80 at the time, and seen sitting on the edge of a lake at Balmoral. Charles says: ‘It must have been quite reassuring for Mama to have someone like that when she first started – all that experience going back a long way. The shoe’s on the other foot now.’ The film collection comprises probably the most intimate look at the Queen throughout her reign, a cinematic family album. In another shot, Charles leaps from the top of a sand dune, tumbling as he hits the ground and laughing and giggling as he appears to show off in front of the camera. It is the kind of happy holiday snapshot that graces family photograph albums and personal video collections in homes across the country. Watching it from Birkhall, his Scottish home not far from Balmoral, the Prince of Wales watched the footage with fondness, not speaking about what he was watching but was clearly enjoyed it as he laughed along gently. Pony-riding prince: A slightly grumpy-looking Charles sets off on an excursion in a matching red hat and coat .

Throughout . the film, the Prince shares memories and recalls events from both her . public and private life, adding his own commentary and insights. Among the great public moments of the reign for which he provides additional insight is the Coronation in 1953. In one sequence, he recalls how The Queen practised wearing the Coronation crown around Buckingham Palace – even at bathtime. ‘I . remember my Mama coming, you know, up, when we were being bathed as . children, wearing the crown.  It was quite funny – practising,’ he says.

'Amazing poise': The Queen, pictured on her Coronation tour in October 1953, is held in 'respect and affection' by leaders across the globe, Charles says . Watching . the footage some sixty years later, the Prince comments on his mother’s . ‘amazing poise’ and, later, her ‘natural grace’. Although . the prince and his mother have found themselves at odds over the years, . with Charles accusing her of being a somewhat aloof figure, he adds: . ‘My Mama takes great pride in her family, from being a young mother at . the start of her reign, to now being a great grandmother twice over.’ He . demonstrates this by showing pictures to illustrate the more personal . aspect of very public moments, such as his mother and father visiting . him on sports day Hill House School, West London, in the summer of 1957. In his tribute, the prince also draws extensively from news archive to remind us of key public moments such the spectacle of the Coronation, and The Queen’s many overseas tours and visits. ‘I think just the sheer number of Heads of State who are coming to the Jubilee celebrations shows the respect and affection with which my mama is held all around the world,’ he says. ‘I so admire the way she’s managed to hold that unique association – the Commonwealth – together.’ The Prince also points out that The Queen has opened Parliament in Britain 59 times, adding: ‘I’ve always thought my Mama looks absolutely wonderful in that tiara’ before noting that two of her twelve Prime Ministers were not even born when she came to the throne. ‘The fact that my Mama has been a constant feature on the scene has provided that sense, I think, of continuity in a time of immense change over 60 years,’ he says. ‘The Queen has provided an amazing record of devotion, dedication and commitment.’ Historic moment: The Queen at the Coronation ceremony at Westminster Abbey in 1953.

"A shape emerges under the murky green waters as a whale slowly glides, oblivious to the gasps of awe and camera clicks above it. Soon it is joined by another and the sound of shutter clicks resonate in the still, calm air. This was the special moment a group of  lucky sightseers encountered the massive humpback whales of Canada. Once in a lifetime: The whale sighting was a 'spiritual occasion' for sightseers on a whale watching excursion . Unaware of the fuss surrounding their appearance, the whales continue to swim calmly. Furiously taking photographs, the tourists are mesmerised by the graceful movements of the cetaceans as they approach the boat. The pair of friendly humpback whales seem to have no fear of the boatload of watchers and swim ever closer to the vessel. Gasps of awe are heard as they  experience the rare moment. Doug Davis, the owner of Prince Rupert Adventure Tours who organised the whale watching, spoke to CTV News Vancouver about the experience. 'People on the boat had never seen a whale before and all of a sudden you have these whales going right up to the boat,' Mr Davis said of the encounter. Up close and personal: Many of the tourists had not seen a whale before, let alone this close up . More videos of the encounter have since emerged on YouTube, uploaded by the sightseers on the tour . The whales were spotted off the British Columbia coast near Prince Rupert in Canada . 'It's a bit of a spiritual occasion. It puts us in our place a little bit.' According to Mr Davis, the whales behaved rather unusually, swimming around the vessel for the next few hours. He told the Canadian news agency that the group spotted a large pod of at least ten transient killer whales  in the distance. Mr Davis believed the humpbacks were intentionally avoiding the orcas. 'If you look at the end of the video, I took the ID's of the whales,' he said. 'You can actually see the bottom edge of one of the tail flukes had teeth marks on it. 'Obviously this whale had an experience with killer whales before.' Mr Davis said this experience was among one of his best whale watching tours . 'You see this kind of stuff once in a while, not very often,' he said. 'To actually experience it – everybody was just totally in awe.' More videos of the encounter have since emerged on YouTube, uploaded by the sightseers on the tour. 'Fantastic weather. Great number of whales. Couldn't ask for a better way to spend a Saturday!' Eric Bombardier posted  on YouTube. And tourist, Melanie Hooker, who was also on the boat that day posted a video on YouTube. 'Humpback whales ""playing"" around our whale watching vessel for about 45 minutes. Getting up close and personal,' she wrote.","The whales were spotted off the British Columbia coast near Prince Rupert .

"Sex between 13-year-olds is a normal part of growing up, according to official guidance for teachers. The online resource for school staff also gives sexual behaviour in nine-year-olds the green light. Drawn up by sexual health service Brook, the national guidance was sent to all schools earlier this year. Education select committee chairman Graham Stuart warned youngsters should be told that under-age sex is 'dangerous' while Sarah Carter, of the Family Education Trust, said that sometimes what is taught in school sex and relationship lessons is against the law . The Family Education Trust – which sounded the alarm over the pack in evidence to MPs on the Commons education select committee – yesterday urged the Government to distance itself from the advice. But it has already been endorsed by the Department for Education and a string of ministers including Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. Although it is not specifically intended to form part of sex education lessons, it encourages teachers to view sex between 13-year-olds as normal. Campaigners warned MPs yesterday that it effectively condones unlawful behaviour because the age of consent is 16. The advice also describes masturbation and ‘consensual kissing’ as a ‘green behaviour’ – a permitted one – for children as young as nine. The traffic light code used by Brook tells teachers and other professionals how to assess whether children’s sexual behaviour is healthy or unhealthy. It lists green, amber and red ‘behaviours’ for different age groups. For 13 to 17-year-olds, green behaviours include ‘having sexual or non-sexual relationships’, ‘sexual activity including hugging, kissing, holding hands’ and ‘consenting oral and/or penetrative sex with others of the same or opposite gender who are of similar age and developmental ability’. These behaviours are said to reflect ‘safe and healthy sexual development’ and ‘natural curiosity, experimentation, consensual activities and positive choices’. They also provide teachers with ‘opportunities to give positive feedback and additional information’ to the pupils. Sarah Carter, of the Family Education Trust, told MPs that the guidance was at odds with what many parents would want their children to be told. She said: ‘Take the Brook traffic light tool, for instance. It states that young people who are consensually sexually active from the age of 13, [that] this is normal behaviour and development. ‘Whereas, actually, the law states that a young person should wait until they are 16 at least, never mind if they are ready or not. So quite often what’s taught in SRE [sex and relationships education] isn’t always lawful.’ She added: ‘If a teacher has a moral standpoint that young people should be sexually active from the age of 13 then that’s what they are going to communicate to their classroom, when actually that’s a value that parents may not share. They may like their young person to wait before they are sexually active.’ Brook insisted yesterday the tool was specifically designed to help teachers identify children who were being abused or exploited, rather than being used in sex education lessons. But the tool is recommended in the guidance under a section headed ‘How do I teach about healthy relationships, sexual consent, exploitation and abuse?’ There was further pressure on the Government last night as an authority on teenage pregnancy rates added his voice to calls for the guidance to be ignored. The Brook 'Traffic Light Tool' states that for children as yoiung as 13 'green behaviour' includes 'consenting oral and/or penetrative sex' David Paton, a professor of economics at Nottingham University Business School, has already given evidence to the committee’s inquiry. He said there was a ‘big issue’ with describing sexual relations among 13 to 17-year-olds, even if they were a similar age, as ‘safe and healthy development’. ‘I don’t think anyone would agree that it is,’ he said. ‘There’s an awful of evidence that early sexual activity is associated with all sorts of adverse outcomes including early pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases but also mental health issues and adverse academic outcomes. ‘The advice is both misleading and potentially dangerous.’ Joe Hayman, chief executive of the PSHE Association, said he would look again at the links included in the guidance . Graham Stuart, the Labour MP who chairs the education committee, warned that critics might argue that to send out messages that 13-year-olds having sex together is part of growing up and 'not to send out a message that it's wrong, that it's harmful, it's dangerous, is in fact to almost to collude with something which we know is damaging to young people'. Joe Hayman, chief executive of the PSHE Association, said that all the resources that the PSHE Association produces are clear about teaching about the law. 'I think the only challenge with dealing with these subjects, and this is why we need really well-trained teachers, is that we've got to deal with children's realities,' he told the committee. Mr Hayman said: 'What I was saying was that it's really, really important that a dictatorial-from-the-front lesson on what one should and shouldn't do is less likely to have an impact and I think we've got to start from where children are, their reality. 'There's no one in our community who feels we should be trying to sexualise children, or any of those kinds of things. 'What we want is children to develop healthy and safe relationships and it's really important that teachers are provided with the necessary training in order to do that.' Questioned further about Brook's Traffic Light Tool, Mr Hayman insisted it was difficult for him to be accountable for every piece of information linked to in the PSHE Association's supplementary guidance, which has many links within it. He agreed to write to the committee about the issue. A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘No teacher should ever encourage or condone behaviour which is unlawful or risky. ‘Good quality relationship education is an important part of preparing young people for life. ‘Schools should ensure young people develop positive values and a moral framework that will guide their decisions, judgments and behaviour. ‘This guidance by Brook is not intended for use in planning sex and relationship lessons.’","Family campaigners warn behaviour encouraged in schools is unlawful .

Majorca and Ibiza were revealed as the most popular destinations last season, up 68 per cent and 46 per cent from last year, respectively, according to a survey by UK travel organisation Abta.

"On a gloomy November afternoon, I helped carry the inexpensive wooden casket of Lee Harvey Oswald to a grave on a slight rise dotted with dying grass. With no mourners around to serve as pallbearers, it was a task that fell to me and a few other reporters covering the funeral of John F. Kennedy's assassin. Fifty years later, I remain a reluctant and minor footnote in American history. It was a story that began with a tip: Oswald would be buried at Rose Hill Cemetery in Fort Worth, where he had spent part of his childhood, just one day after nightclub owner Jack Ruby shot and killed him during a jail transfer on Nov. 24, 1963, itself just two days after Kennedy's death. As the Fort Worth correspondent for The Associated Press, I drew the assignment. Scroll down for video . Bizarre turn: Reporters were enlisted to act as pall bearers for Lee Harvey Oswald's coffin in 1969 when no mourners turned up. Associated Press reporter Mike Cochran is pictured holding his notepad, front . I arrived to discover dozens of police and federal agents, writers and photographers, but no mourners waiting to bid Oswald goodbye or good riddance. A police escort delivered Oswald's casket in the early afternoon. Much later, officers arrived with his family: mother Marguerite, brother Robert, widow Marina and her two daughters, June Lee, 2, and infant Rachel. No one else would follow; even the minister failed to show. Shaking his head ever so slightly, Jerry Flemmons of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram turned to me and said, 'Cochran, if we're gonna write a story about the burial of Lee Harvey Oswald, we're gonna have to bury the son of a bitch ourselves.' Sure enough, officials asked the gathered reporters to serve as pallbearers. I was among the first they asked, my reply not just 'No!' but 'Hell no!' Today: Cochran, pictured at his home in Haltom City, Texas, said he initially said 'hell no!' to carrying the coffin . Then Preston McGraw of United Press . International stepped forward and volunteered, and with my top . competition for scoops accepting the duty, I realized my error and . joined McGraw and other reporters. The ceremony itself was as brief as it was simple. The Rev. Louis Saunders, executive secretary of the Fort Worth Council of Churches, had been drafted to fill in for the missing minister. His words - 'we are not here to judge, only to commit for burial Lee Harvey Oswald - were barely audible, mingled with muffled sobs by Oswald's mother and widow. Her eyes red and swollen, Marina Oswald stepped beside her husband's casket and quietly whispered something. Not long after the nation's slain president was laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery with tearful family members and millions of television viewers around the world looking on, Oswald's body was lowered into his grave at 4.28pm. Surreal: He holds a photograph showing him carrying the casket 50 years ago beside other reporters . Making history: Cochran uses a magnifying glass to highlight his face along with the other reporters . For years, I would continue to report on . the assassination, interviewing Oswald's mother, investigating . conspiracy theories and writing stories on the anniversary of that . dreadful day in Dallas. For one of the first of those . anniversary stories, I wanted to interview Oswald's widow. She had . remarried, moved to suburban Dallas and rarely spoke to reporters. Her . new husband had reportedly brandished a pistol and chased one writer . away. Early on a cloudy November morning, I staked out their house and trudged up the steps after he left for work. I had not called ahead, but identified myself as an AP reporter when Marina Oswald opened the door. 'I am no longer news,' she said, making it clear she did not intend to talk with me. She was slim and blonde, with arresting eyes of an intense blue-green and a distinctive Russian accent. She was 24 and I must have stared like a smitten dolt. Empty: Only his widow Marina Oswald, his brother, mother and two children had attended to the funeral . Overwhelmed: Marina is pictured at the funeral. Years later when Cochran knocked on her door for an interview and told her he had been there that day, the long-silent widow welcomed him inside . 'Is something wrong?' she asked. Embarrassed, I babbled something about not having seen her since that day at Rose Hill. 'You were there?' she asked. I told her I was a pallbearer. Surprised, she said the least she could do was invite me in for coffee. Several hours later, we were still talking and smoking. Denied cigarettes by Oswald during their marriage, she was now a chain smoker. 'Have you ever tried to analyze yourself?' she asked me at one point, then added: It's very hard to do.' Killed: Oswald was arrested for shooting dead President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963 as he drove through Dallas, Texas. Oswald was shot dead two days later as he was transferred to a jail . Asked about the Warren Commission's . conclusion that her husband was the lone assassin, she said: 'I think . about it a lot. I try to forget. It is very difficult. It is like a . nightmare. ... I have nightmares.' Years later, in 1983, when working on a story about the 20th anniversary, I interviewed Marina Oswald for the second and last time. She was no less candid and still a heavy smoker. 'For a while I thought it would all blow over, just go away,' she said. 'But now I accept the fact that I must live with this the rest of my life. 'I may still be naive, but I'm not stupid.'","Mike Cochran was sent to Rose Hill Cemetery in Fort Worth, Texas to report on the funeral - but no mourners turned up to carry the casket .

"A New York photographer has created a fascinating image that reveals the sheer volume of air traffic at one of the city’s airports. Paul Ker’s composite photo shows every plane landing at LaGuardia Airport on a recent summer day between 1pm and 2pm. With nearly 40 passenger jets in the image, that amounts to one landing roughly every 90 seconds. Scroll down for video . Cleared for landing: Photographer Paul Ker snapped a photo of every plane landing at LaGuardia Airport . Mr Ker's striking image makes it look like the planes are flying together in unison – like a fleet of alien spacecraft going in for the attack – but they were snapped individually as they approached the airport at low altitude. He photographed the commercial aircraft from his home in Woodside, Queens, where he is used to the sound of rumbling planes. Mr Ker told Gothamist: ‘It gets quite loud when we’re out on our terrace, but not nearly as loud as when they take off in this direction. That gets really bad.’ In terms of passenger traffic, LaGuardia is the third busiest of the New York area’s three major airports. More than 23 million travellers passed through the airport in 2013, an increase of 6.6 per cent from 2012.

"A pair of mysterious fast-moving discs of light have been pictured in the skies over the Berkshire town of Bracknell. Steve Lambert, 42, was making a phone call outside the town's Running Horse Pub when he spotted the UFOs at 8pm on Friday. The driving instructor from Basingstoke, Hampshire, said: 'I was drinking with my girlfriend and her son.' The truth is out there: These two discs of light were spotted flying at speed above the Berkshire town of Bracknell by a shocked pubgoer . He added: 'I went outside to make a phone call when something caught my attention. 'It was around 8pm at night so there was a little bit of sun but it was mainly overcast. 'It was heading south west and quicker than any normal aircraft. 'I only saw it for less than five seconds. 'I have seen a lot of funny things in the sky and I have always practised trying to take a photo quickly on my mobile phone. 'I am interested to see if anyone else saw it and whether there were any other witnesses. 'I really want to know what is going on out there - there probably is life out there.' Mr Lambert posted the photo to . Facebook to get his friends' perspective on the mystery and and now . wants to hear from anyone else who saw the UFOs. I want to believe: Mr Lambert has asked other people in Bracknell who may have seen the UFOs to get in touch with him . A former Ministry of Defence (MoD) UFO expert says the photo is 'one of the best' he has seen. Nick Pope, who investigated reports of UFO sightings from 1991 to 1994, said: 'The shape and colour seems to rule out things like aircraft lights or Chinese lanterns. 'It would be interesting to know if anyone else saw this, or if anything unusual was tracked on radar.' This is the second UFO sighting over Bracknell this year after a mystery object was spotted just two miles from where this photo was taken. In February a man, who wished to remain anonymous, said it he saw an object which was orange, bright red and yellow, which 'streaked across the sky for all of three seconds'.

"A Thanksgiving party at a fraternity and sorority house in which men reportedly dressed up in colonial-era costumes and women wore scantily clad Native American-themed outfits is being branded ‘racist’. Officials at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) in San Luis Obispo told NBC News that they were investigating an off-campus party allegedly called, ‘Colonial Bros and Nava-Hos.’ The university is looking into suggestions that the party was both racist and sexist, despite the event being held off campus. Under investigation: The school's fraternity is under investigation for throwing ¿Colonial Bros and Nava-hos¿ party . ‘Cal Poly is currently reviewing an off-campus party that occurred on November 16 that may have included culturally insensitive, sexist, and offensive behavior,’ university spokesman Matt Lazier wrote in an email to NBC News. ‘While the gathering was held off campus, the university takes diversity and inclusivity very seriously.’ In a campus-wide email, university President Jeffrey D. Armstrong denounced the party and said university officials ‘will respond to any violations of the Standards for Student Conduct’ following an investigation. Cal Poly President Jeffrey Armstrong: Events like these have no place in the Cal Poly community and are not reflective of the principles of The Mustang Way ¿ Obviously, this was not a university-sponsored event, he wrote in an email . ‘Let us be clear, events like these have no place in the Cal Poly community and are not reflective of the principles of The Mustang Way,’ he wrote. ‘Obviously, this was not a university-sponsored event.’ A frat student spoke to the local paper saying he didn’t think the party ‘was meant to be racist.’ ‘It’s unfair,’ he said. ‘We are taught that Thanksgiving is Pilgrims and Indians.’ One faculty member identified Phi Sigma Kappa as one of three Greek organizations that hosted the party, though the names of the participating frats and/or sororities will not be released until the University decides whether or not to discipline them. Tasteless: A Fraternity at Randolph-Macon is investigating a Mexican-American party that was deemed to be 'socially unacceptable' and 'racist' Tristin Moone, a citizen of the Diné . (Navajo) Nation who is a student of Native American Studies at Columbia . University in New York, told NBC News that she's concerned by the . psychology of those who would think this type of party is acceptable. ‘I . think the mentality that went into the creation of this party, the . mentality that thought this was OK, is ubiquitous in America,’ she said. ‘I’m . worried about indigenous students in that institution not having an . ally or advocate who can help mentor them, and guide students for a . better understanding of Native peoples around the world,’ she said. ‘I . think (parties) like these are very reflective of how the dominant . narrative is supported and nurtured throughout American schools and . universities, and how it stifles and hinders and silences the Native . American narrative,’ she said. Cal Poly University is not the only educational establishment to suffer Frat house parties in poor taste. Just good fun? Or is it inappropriate for students to dress up as 'illegal' immigrants. The university says it will bring those responsible to account . The Kappa Alpha fraternity at Randolph-Macon College in Virginia may be punished for holding a USA vs. Mexico theme party last weekend. Photos show party goers dressed in stereotypical clothing such as sombreros and big mustaches meant to represent Mexicans. One of the drinking games played at the party involved 'Americans' trying to catch 'illegal immigrants.' Kappa Alpha member Mark Heideman insisted it was not 'meant to be racist whatsoever.' Either way, the college is now investgating. 'The college finds this type of conduct reprehensible and in direct conflict with our values,' the college said in a statement. 'We are in the process of holding the individuals and groups involved responsible through our judicial process.'","Frat party held to celebrate Thanksgiving involved men and women dressing up as 'Colonials' and 'Native Americans'

"Remarkable: Captain Robert Campbell returned to a German PoW camp after being given permission to leave to visit his dying mother in Britain by the Kaiser . When British prisoner of war Robert Campbell asked the Kaiser if he could visit his dying mother, he was astonished to be given permission – on condition that he promised to return. The Army captain kept his word and returned to the German camp after the two-week trip in November 1916, remaining in captivity until the end of the First World War. Historian Richard van Emden, who discovered the incredible incident, said such an act of chivalry was rare even a century ago. ‘Capt Campbell was an officer and he made a promise on his honour to go back,’ he said. ‘Had he not turned up there would not have been any retribution on any other prisoners. ‘What I think is more amazing is that the British Army let him go back to Germany. The British could have said to him, “You’re not going back, you’re going to stay here”.’ Capt Campbell, who joined the Army in 1903, was leading the 1st Bn East Surrey Regiment when his battalion took up a position on the Mons-Condé canal in north-west France just weeks after war broke out in July 1914. A week later, his troops were attacked by the German forces and Capt Campbell was seriously injured and captured. The 29-year-old was treated in a military hospital in Cologne before being sent to the prisoner-of-war camp in Magdeburg. In 1916, he received word from home that his mother Louise was dying of cancer. He wrote to Kaiser Wilhelm II, begging to be allowed to see her one last time. The Kaiser gave him two weeks’ compassionate leave, including two days travelling in each direction by boat and train, on the proviso Capt Campbell gave his word as a British Army officer that he would return. Capt Campbell reached his mother’s bedside in Gravesend, Kent, on November 7 and spent a week with her before keeping his promise and returning to Germany. His mother died three months later in February 1917. Mr van Emden, 48, discovered the amazing story after reading correspondence between the Foreign Office and their German counterparts and it is told in his new book, Meeting the Enemy: The Human Face of the Great War. He said of Capt Campbell’s amazing story: ‘I think it is such a unique example that I don’t think you can draw any parallels. In my experience, this is a one-off and is one of those things that just tickles your fancy.’ SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Evidence: A note found in the National Archives reveals when Capt Campbell was due to return home for a 'fortnight's leave of absence' Historic: This document shows how he was allowed to return to his family home in Gravesend Kent in November 1916 and spent a week with his cancer-stricken mother - then went back to prison for the final two years of war . Progress: This memo from 1916 shows how Captain Campbell came via Holland on his journey home to see his mum on 'parole' After the war, Capt Campbell was released and returned to Britain where he served in the military until retiring in 1925. However, . he rejoined his regiment in 1939 on the outbreak of the Second World . War, serving as the Chief Observer of the Royal Observer Corps on the . Isle of Wight. He survived that war unscathed and died in Britain in . July 1966 aged 81. Mr van . Emden’s book charts the personal contacts between Britons and Germans . and their feelings towards each other as the First World War progressed. Discovery: Historian Richard van Emden (pictured left) made . the discovery of the documents about Capt Campbell who lead the 1st Bn . East Surrey Regiment whose badge is pictured, right . More detail: This official memo from the U.S. Embassy in London showed that the agreement between Campbell and the Germans went via the Americans . Didn't work both ways: German Peter Gastreich asked to be allowed to leave the Isle of Wight to visit his dying father, but the British refused to accept Captain Campbell's case set a precedent . The highest display of . respect he discovered was between pilots fighting above the lines. The . pilots did not carry parachutes because they were too bulky for the . narrow cockpits of the day. If their aircraft caught fire, they faced the choice of burning alive or jumping out. German . pilots made it a habit to find their victims, dead or alive. If dead, . they sent details of their names and burial sites across British lines. If found alive, they would invite them to a slap-up meal in their mess. Both sides were ruthless when fighting each other in the air but observed the rules of chivalry on the ground. Troop: Capt Campbell was among troops like these ones when he was captured at the very start of the war . Recovery: Captain Campbell was was treated at this military hospital in Cologne before he was taken to the POW camp . Prisoner of war: Capt Campbell had been leading the 1st Bn East Surrey Regiment when his battalion fought at the Monds-Conde canal in north-western France (pictured), where he was injured and captured . Incredibly Kaiser Wilhelm II granted the request allowing the officer two weeks leave as long as he returned . Kaiser Wilhelm II, the last emperor of Germany, had a schizophrenic relationship with Britain until he was forced to abdicate in 1918. He was Queen Victoria’s grandson and his mother was Victoria, Princess Royal, who married Prince Frederick of Prussia in 1858. Wilhelm developed a passion for Britain, but was furious that he was never accepted by its high society. The expansion of the German navy before the war was inspired by his love, and his mother’s, for the Royal Navy. He once told his uncle Edward VII that his dream was to have a ‘fleet of my own some day’. Historian David Fromkin said: ‘The half-German side of him was at war with the half-English side. He was wildly jealous of the British, wanting to be British, wanting to be better at being British than the British were, while at the same time resenting them.’ As the First World War dragged on, Wilhelm’s influence with the military faded and he was reduced to handing out awards.","Captain Robert Campbell was injured and captured in France in July, 1914 .

"Sommeliers are able to identify hundreds of flavours in wine, from woody notes to citrus bursts and chocolate undertones. But now a nanosensor could be threatening their livelihood. Dubbed 'mini-mouth', the sensor mimics the reaction that wine creates on a person's tongue to determine how the alcohol tastes and, in particular, how astringent it is. The nanosensor, dubbed 'mini-mouth' (pictured) uses salivary proteins to mimic the reaction wine creates on a human tongue. It does this by measuring the molecules and chemical compounds. From this, it determines the astringency - and overall flavour - of wine . The technology was created by PhD student Joana Guerreiro from Aarhus University in Denmark. Vineyard owners turn grapes into wine using a series of highly-controlled processes, designed to bring out the desired flavour in the product that ends up on the shelves. An important part of the taste is known in wine terminology as astringency, and it is characterised by the dry sensation drinkers get in their mouth when they drink red wine, in particular. The tannins in the wine bring out this sensation, which is often likened to biting into an unripe banana. The sensor is a small plate coated with nanoscale gold particles. On this plate, the researchers simulate what happens in a person’s mouth by first adding some of the proteins contained in saliva. After this they add the wine. The gold particles on the plate act as nano-optics and make it possible to focus a beam of light below the diffraction limit, making it possible to precisely measure something that is very small - down to 20 nanometres. This makes it possible to study and follow the proteins, and to see what effect the wine has, and ultimately see the extent to which the small molecules have to bind together for the clumping effect on the protein to be set off. These are mixed with lots of tastes in the wine and feel both soft and dry. Ms Guerreiro and her fellow researchers at the Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Centre (iNANO), Aarhus University, have now developed a nanosensor capable of measuring the effect of astringency in a mouth when people drink wine. The sensor uses salivary proteins to measure the sensation that would be felt on a human mouth. The researchers study how the proteins change in the interaction with the wine, and they can use this to describe the effect of the wine. ‘There is great potential in this,’ said the university. ‘Both for the wine producers and for research into the medicine of the future. ‘Indeed, it is the first time a sensor has been produced that not only measures the amount of proteins and molecules in your mouth when you drink wine, but also measures the effect of wine – or other substances – entering your mouth.’ The sensor additionally makes it possible for wine producers to control the development of astringency during wine production because they can measure the level of astringency in the wine at the start of the process. These tests can only currently be achieved when the wine is ready, and only by using a professional tasting panel. This also comes with a level of human inaccuracy. Until now, the focus has been on the clumping together that takes place fairly late in the process of wine-making, but with the sensor, researchers have developed a method that mimics the binding and change in the structure of the proteins, which typically happens during the early part of the process (stock image) ‘We don’t want to replace the wine taster. We just want a tool that is useful in wine production,’ said Ms Guerreiro. ‘When you produce wine, you know that the finished product should have a distinct taste with a certain level of astringency. If it doesn’t work, people won’t drink the wine.’ ‘The sensor expands our understanding of the concept of astringency. ‘The sensation arises because of the interaction between small organic molecules in the wine and proteins in your mouth. This interaction gets the proteins to change their structure and clump together.’ She said that, until now, the focus has been on the clumping together that takes place fairly late in the process, but with the sensor, her team has developed a method that mimics the binding and change in the structure of the proteins, which typically happens during the early part of the process.","The nanosensor was created by researchers at Aarhus University .
