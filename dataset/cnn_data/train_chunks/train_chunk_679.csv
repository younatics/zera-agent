You may not be able to sneak a bottle of wine into your local theater, but at least now there is the possibility to feel as though you've had a sip, thanks to this latest foodie first. Popcorn fused with wine is the latest hybrid invention between NYC-based Populence and New Zealand wine maker Kim Crawford. The boozy snack comes in two flavors: Pinot Noir Drizzle and Sauvignon Blanc Kettle.

Pricey popcorn: A one -gallon tin of the stuff costs $35 - and it won't get you drunk either . Wine Popcorn: There must almost be enough in that bowl to get drunk! The idea is to physically pair up the . wine-drizzled popcorn with a bottle of the real thing, however you won't get . drunk from munching away on the corn kernels however. The . non-alcoholic snacks were inspired by the fact that Populence founder . Maggie Paulus noticed that her wares were especially popular for wine . pairing parties. 'The idea of actually incorporating a high-end wine such as Kim Crawford into a unique new recipe is exciting,' she said. The two new flavors are made in-house at Populence's New York's West Village store. Homemade: The pinot noir flavor (left) sees the red wine reduction mixed with tempered chocolate.

British detectives are hoping to finally catch the killer of a young woman brutally murdered in Thailand 13 years ago after they were given full access to the case files for the first time. Kirsty Jones, 23, was raped and strangled at a guesthouse in northern Thailand in 2000 while enjoying a gap year after university. After 13 years her killer has never been brought to justice - and Kirsty's desperate family feared the trail had gone cold. Tragedy: Liverpool University gradute Kirsty Jones went to Chiang Mai as part of her big trip - going on jungle hikes, riding elephants and visiting tribes - before she was raped and strangled . But the British detective investigating the murder said he is 'very optimistic' the case can be solved after being given full access to all files for the first time by the Thai authorities. Detective Superintendent Andy John - who led the investigation which caught April Jones' killer Mark Bridger - said advances in DNA and fresh interviews with witnesses could provide a breakthrough. He said his team have been given full access to all the material gathered by the Department of Special Investigation in Thailand and would be re-interviewing British witnesses who have since returned home. Det Supt John said: 'We see these developments as very significant. 'We know from our experience in the UK with cold case reviews that some cases are solved many years after they occurred and there's nothing to say we can't find a similar outcome in this case. 'The fact that we are undertaking a forensic review in the UK using the best resources available in the field is an extremely positive step. Grieving: Kirsty's mother Sue Jones and her son Gareth are hopeful that British detectives will be able to find the backpacker's killer . 'The DSI are in the process of . reinvestigating this inquiry and we are keen to support and where . possible, assist the Thai authorities. 'They have done a considerable amount of work, we've seen proof of that during the visit to Thailand last year.' Kirsty's . battling mum Sue Jones said the new developments have provided a boost . to the family to 'keep forging on' in their fight for justice. Farmer's daughter Kirsty grew up in the village of Tredomen, near Brecon, Mid Wales. But . she dreamed of seeing the world and had decided from the age of 14 that . she had wanted to take a gap year before going on to university. In 1996 when she set off for Australia and stopped off in Thailand on her way home. After a safe and successful trip, the bright A-level student had fallen in love with travelling. She . completed an English and media studies degree at Liverpool University . in 1999 - then spent a year doing odd jobs to fund her next big trip. Mourners are pictured arriving for Kirsty's funeral in Llanfilo, Wales following her murder in Thailand 13 years ago . She had planned a two-year global adventure taking in Asia as well as Australia and New Zealand before finishing in South America. Her family said they felt no reason to worry second time around as Ms Jones was older, wiser and more experienced. Kirsty headed 435 miles north of Bangkok to the well-known trekking hub Chiang Mai - going on jungle hikes, riding elephants and visiting hill tribes. But a month later the dream was shattered when her parents were given the devastating news that their daughter had been raped and strangled to death. Despite a series of arrests, no-one has faced justice for her murder. But DS John, of the Dyfed Powys force in Wales, said: 'We see these developments as very significant. 'You know from your experience in the UK with cold case reviews that some cases are solved many years after they occurred and there's nothing to say we can't find a similar outcome in this case. 'The fact that we are undertaking a forensic review in the UK using the best resources available in the field is an extremely positive step.' 'in the UK we are advanced in many respects in terms of the way we approach criminal investigations and the access to specialists that we have. 'And I just want to maximise the opportunities which we've got.' DS John, who has worked on some of the biggest cases in the forces' history, including the investigation into the abduction and murder of five-year-old April Jones. He added he was 'very optimistic' new evidence would be found from the forensic review given recent advances in technology.

The new pro version of Microsoft's Surface tablet will come out of the box with nearly two-thirds of its 64GB storage already used up, it emerged today. Set for its North American release next week, the $899 tablet computer will boot up with just 23GB of usable space, while its 128GB big brother will actually only have 83GB free. The revelation is an embarrassment for Microsoft, with the lack of free space damaging claims its latest top of the range tablet could be a fully featured laptop replacement. Not so spacious: Microsoft's Surface Pro tablet, which will ship with more than two-thirds of its 64GB storage space already used up by its operating system and pre-installed apps . And it compares badly with tablet rival Apple's freshly announced 128GB iPad, which is expected to ship with 115GB free for storing files and apps. The problem stems from the Surface Pro's use of the full version of the Windows 8 operating system, rather than the slimmed-down Windows RT installed on its cheaper siblings. Windows 8 alone takes up 20GB of space, but the OS claims even more of the Surface's solid-state hard drive for a 'recovery partition' to back up users' data right there on their tablets. Add to that the Surface Pro's built-in apps and the trial version of Office 2013 it ships with, and users of the 64GB version will find most of their devices already full. Other tablets, including the iPad, the Surface RT, and Android-powered devices, run on specially slimmed down operating systems which dispense with much of the functionality of those found on laptop and desktop computers to save space. That means they are unable to run the same software as 'real' computers and users must purchase apps that are specially designed for the tablet format. Microsoft had accordingly made great shakes of the Surface Pro's ability to run full Windows versions of popular software packages, but the lack of space seems to contradict the company's attempts to market the Intel-powered tablet as a laptop replacement. Out next week: The revelation is an embarrassment for Microsoft, with the lack of free space damaging claims its latest top of the range laptop could be a fully featured laptop replacement . With just 23GB to work with, users who want to use the device for storage space-hungry applications like photo and video editing will quickly find their hard drives filling up. Simply installing the latest version of Adobe's Creative Suite, a popular package of creative software, would take up a further 14.5GB of that - without including the extra 10GB recommended for a swap file. Microsoft was quick to point out that much of the used space on the box-fresh Surface Pro can be reclaimed, NBC News reported. However the method, which involves uninstalling packaged apps and moving or deleting the recovery partition, is likely to be difficult for computer novices to carry out. Despite running a slimmed-down Windows, the Surface RT had a similar problem, shipping with about half its disk space already full. That resulted in a consumer backlash, although Microsoft insisted that the crunch was unavoidable. Microsoft will release the Pro version of its Surface tablet in North America on February 9 with a price tag of $899 for the 64GB version and $999 for the 128GB version - making it the most expensive tablet computer in the world.","$899 tablet will start up with only 23GB of usable space, while its $999 128GB big brother will actually have 83GB available .

A Mexican woman known as a drug cartel queen has pleaded guilty in Miami to drug charges arising from a major cocaine trafficking case. Court records show Sandra Avila Beltran pleaded guilty Tuesday to being an accessory after the fact in an organization that included Juan Diego Espinosa Ramirez. He was her boyfriend at the time. Espinosa was a former liaison between Mexico's Sinaloa cartel and Colombia's Norte Valle cartel. He pleaded guilty in 2009 to cocaine trafficking charges. Queenpin: Sandra Avila Beltran pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact in a drug cartel . A statement signed by Avila, who was . known as the 'Queen of the Pacific,' says she provided money to Espinosa . for travel and lodging so he could evade arrest by authorities between . 2002 and 2004. The 52-year-old, famous from getting . Botox injections in jail, faces a maximum of 15 years in prison at a . July 25 sentencing hearing. Her American attorney, Steve Ralls, told the New York Daily News Avila, whom he described as being in very good spirits, may be released from the downtown Miami prison and could get credit for time served. Mexican officials extradited the suspected drug trafficker to the United States in August 2012. Avila Beltran was handed over at the Toluca airport . outside Mexico City to U.S. Marshals who took her to Miami to face federal . cocaine-trafficking charges, the attorney general's office said. Beginning of the end: Avila was extradited from Mexico to the US on drug charges last summer . Bad company: In this photo released by Mexico's Federal Secretary of Public Safety, Sandra Avila Beltran, left, is seen next to famous Mexican drug trafficker Ismael Zambada, right, in 1993 . Avila had been acquitted of similar charges in Mexico and . her defense argued unsuccessfully that meant she should not be extradited. In June, a court granted the extradition so she could face . the charges pending in the U.S., where prosecutors allege she also had links to . cocaine seizures in Chicago. In 2001, U.S. agents intercepted a telephone call . in which Avila allegedly asked for payment for 220lbs of . cocaine delivered in Chicago. Prosecutors allege Avila spent more than a decade working her way to the top of Mexico's drug trade. She faces federal cocaine-trafficking charges now that she is in the U.S. Federal prosecutors said the extradition request indicates . Avila belonged to an organization that trafficked cocaine from Colombia to the . United States. U.S. prosecutors allege she helped store and move shipments of . the drug from Mexico to the United States. Until Thursday, Avila had been held in a prison in Mexico's . Pacific coast state of Nayarit, pending trial for a separate money-laundering . charge. The Sinaloa cartel led by drug kingpin Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman (pictured in 1993) has been locked in a vicious fight with the violent Zetas gang in several regions of Mexico . It was not immediately clear how Mexican prosecutors would proceed with . that case. Avila, who was arrested in 2007 sipping coffee in a Mexico . City diner, has said she is innocent. A popular narcocorrido ballad about her sung by the band Los Tigres del Norte, titled The Queen of Queens, describes her 2007 arrest alongside Espinosa. 'The more beautiful the rose,' one line in the song says, 'the sharper the thorns.' Prosecutors have alleged that Avila spent more than a decade . working her way to the top of Mexico's drug trade. They say her romance with . Colombian Juan Diego Espinoza brought together Mexico's powerful Sinaloa cartel . with Colombia's Norte del Valle. The Sinaloa cartel led by drug kingpin Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman has been locked in a vicious fight with the violent Zetas gang in several . regions of Mexico. The New York Times has reported that Avila was arrested in 2007 while having coffee in a Mexico City diner. She calmly asked the federal agents to let her freshen her makeup before the police filmed her walking out in tight jeans and stilettos on the arm of a law enforcement officer. Born into the drug trafficking business, prosecutors have alleged that Avila spent more than a decade working her way to the top of Mexico's drug trade using a lethal combination of a sharp business sense, connections and sex appeal. They say her long-time romantic relationship with suspected Colombian Juan Diego Espinoza, also known as 'El Tigre,' brought together Mexico's powerful Sinaloa cartel with Colombia's feared Norte del Valle. While most of her lovers were involved with the drug trade, both of her husbands came from a decidedly different background. Her first husband, José Luis Fuentes, was the commander of the federal police in Sinaloa, who was later executed. Infamous: The raven-haired beauty made headlines after it was revealed that she had received Botox injections while in jail . Later, she married Rodolfo López Amavizca, the commander of the now-defunct National Institute for the Combat Against Drugs, who was also murdered. Officials said that in parallel to her successful cocaine-shipping business, Avila established a string of tanning salons and a real estate company in Sinaloa. But her luck began to change in 2001, when the authorities seized a tuna boat in the port of Manzanillo and found more than nine tons of cocaine aboard worth $80million. Six months later, Avila’s son was kidnapped and she went to the authorities for help. She had eventually paid a $5million ransom to get her son back, which made law enforcement officials suspicious. An investigation into Avila’s businesses has revealed that she was allegedly linked to the Manzanillo cocaine shipment, but by that time, the ‘Queen of the Pacific’ had gone underground, living under the pseudonym Daniela García Chavez with her Colombian kingpin boyfriend. When she was finally captured and jailed, Avila, the curvaceous, dark-haired beauty long known for her love of luxury, caused an outrage when it was revealed that she received Botox injections behind bars. She also complained about insects in her cell and claimed that the ban on bringing in food from restaurants violated her rights.","Prosecutors say Sandra Avila Beltran worked her way to the top of Mexico's drug trade .

More than two years after the city of Christchurch was brought to its knees by earthquakes, it has finally risen out of the rubble - albeit in an unusual way. The city has built the world's first cardboard cathedral after the original 132-year-old Gothic one was destroyed in the February 2011 earthquake. Much of the city's iconic buildings were flattened by the 6.3 magnitude earthquake, leaving the New Zealand's second-largest city badly scarred. Divine inspiration: The temporary cardboard cathedral has now finally opened . This photo taken on December 5, 2012 shows the fenced-off old Christchurch Cathedral missing its tower . But now at least one of the most recognisable buildings has been replaced - with a cardboard alternative. The temporary Anglican Church opened last week, with a 10-day music series called Joyfully Un-munted to herald its re-opening, RadioNZ reported. The £2million project saw a 700 capacity cathedral built using cardboard tubes. This shows some of the cardboard tubes that were used to support the new Christchurch Cathedral . Houses teeter on the edge after landslides near Christchurch, after a 6.3 earthquake devastated New Zealand's second city and surrounding towns . Japanese architect Shigeru Ban designed the new cathedral in earthquake-devastated Christchurch . Each tube weighs 120kg in the unique design by Japanese emergency architect Shigeru Ban. The triangular prism is fashioned from 98 of these interlocking cardboard tubes, The Independent reported. The temporary structure also uses timber, steel and a concrete base alongside the cardboard tubes . The new building, which has a colourful window, was delivered by Christchurch architectural firm Warren and Mahoney, the Guardian reported. Ban is an internationally-recognised architect, whose innovative work with paper has helped crisis situations. He has constructed shelters made of paper in Haiti following an earthquake that ravaged the country in 2010. He also designed homes made out of cardboard following the 2005 Hurricane Katrina, which flooded New Orleans in Louisiana and wiped away thousands of homes. The quake killed 185 people and injured countless others, leaving Christchurch reeling by the disaster. But Christchurch residents have come up with innovative and creative ways that Christchurch residents are moving on following the catastrophic quake. Other innovative ideas, dubbed Gap Fillers, are also popping up all over the city in a bid to temporarily replace and improve buildings which were damaged and destroyed in the disaster. The Crowne Plaza Hotel, which was demolished in the months after the quake, has made way for an impressive new pavillion made using more than 3,000 wooden pallets. The impressive pavillion, which opened in December, is designed to help address the city's need for new small to medium sized entertainment venues following the demolition of clubrooms and city halls.

Additionally, the millionaire - who was seen with a big cigar hanging out of his mouth at a press conference following his big win - has decided to forgo surgery. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Richie Randazzo, whose colorful personality after winning $5million in the lottery, has been diagnosed with lung cancer . 'It’s the luck of the draw,' Randazzo, 49, told The New York Post from his home . in Gravesend, Brooklyn. 'This time I crapped out, but that’s OK. I woke . up the next day, and I’ve been waking up ever since.' Randazzo's brush with celebrity began in 2008 when he won $5million on a Set for Life scratch-off lottery ticket. Soon after winning the cash, Randazzo was spotted partying with Swedish model Sabina Johansson, who was charged with promoting prostitution shortly after they began dating when authorities raided Big Daddy Lou's Hot Lap Dance Club in April 2008 and found her working as the brothel's 'house mom.' Randazzo - who was a homeless drug addict in the 1980s before attending rehab and landing his doorman job - even appeared on the Howard Stern Show at the peak of his 15 minutes. Optimism: Randazzo is looking forward, despite his prognosis. 'When you're on a losing streak, you have to start winning,' he said . Despite the cash and being a pseudo-celebrity, Randazzo vowed to keep his $40,000 a year doorman job, but was fired when his frequent trips to Atlantic City impacted his job performance. Since getting fired, Randazzo spends his time 'jaunting to West Virginia, Puerto Rico and Atlantic City, fishing in Sheepshead Bay . and dining at Brooklyn spots Di Fara, Peter Luger’s and Spumoni Gardens.' Randazzo gets about $12,000 a month after taxes from his lottery payouts, which he is taking in installments. 'No matter how much money you have, you can’t control your health,' he . said. 'If you get sick, all the money in the world can’t help you.' Randazzo started dating Swedish model Sabina Johansson just weeks after winning $5million from a scratch-off lottery ticket . Three months ago, surgeons tried unsuccessfully to remove the tumor from his lung, and he's already completed a round of chemotherapy and radiation . Now, though, he's opting out of any additional surgeries, and says he plans to travel - and he's looking for a traveling companion after his girlfriend of 18 months dumped him after his cancer diagnosis. 'I’d love to find a good woman to travel with,' Randazzo said. 'I need . somebody to show me how to work a computer. I need to catch up and get . to the 21st century.' Randazzo turns 30 in March and says he's on the lookout for a woman with both brains and beauty. 'Things are always going to change,' he said. 'When you’re on a losing streak, you have to start winning.'","Richie Randazzo's colorful personality landed him on shows like the Howard Stern Show and Fox's Red Eye .

Culture Secretary Maria Miller has delivered an extraordinary attack on the BBC’s sexist sports coverage. In a scathing letter to the director-general Lord Hall, she expressed her anger at presenter John Inverdale’s remarks about Wimbledon singles champion Marion Bartoli. Mrs Miller, who also called for better coverage of women’s sport, demanded updates on ‘further action that is likely to be taken’ over the comments, which prompted hundreds of complaints to the BBC. Earlier this month Inverdale, who is thought to be paid about £600,000 a year, said of Miss Bartoli during coverage of the Wimbledon women’s final: ‘I just wonder if her dad did say to her when she was 12, 13, 14 maybe: “Listen, you are never going to be, you know, a looker. ‘“You are never going to be somebody like a [Maria] Sharapova, you’re never going to be 5 feet 11, you’re never going to be somebody with long legs, so you have to compensate for that. You are going to have to be the most dogged, determined fighter that anyone has ever seen on the tennis court if you are going to make it.” And she kind of is.’ The comments generated more than 700 complaints, and led to demands that Inverdale should be sacked. But the 55-year-old escaped severe sanction by writing a letter of apology to the French champion, and apologising on-air the day after the final. Scroll down for video . French tennis player Marion Bartoli, was the subject of Inverdale's comments. The beleaguered presenter faced criticism several years ago after he seemed to joke about the Duchess of Cornwall’s appearance . Mrs Miller’s letter is her second major intervention over women in sport in recent weeks. To further demonstrate her anger at sexism, she is boycotting the Open golf championship – which begins today with BBC coverage fronted by Inverdale – because it is being held at Muirfield in Scotland, which still refuses to admit women members. She told Lord Hall: ‘I am writing to express my concern over the comments made by John Inverdale about Marion Bartoli, during the BBC’s radio coverage of the Wimbledon women’s final.’ She added: ‘It is ... a matter of some concern to me that any comment on the looks and stature of a female athlete could be made in the context of one of the highlights of the UK’s, and indeed the world’s, sporting calendar. ‘I am sure you will agree with me that it is vital that young women and girls in this country feel motivated both to take part in and to watch coverage of sport, and to know that they are included in the enjoyment of sport, and catered for by the media just as much as the male audience. ‘Whilst I note that Mr Inverdale has . apologised both on-air and in writing to Ms Bartoli, I would be grateful . for an update on any further action that is likely to be taken . following [the] complaints, and whether there may be positive steps that . the BBC could take in the future to ensure that the perception of and . commentary on female athletes, and women’s sport generally, are as . positive and inclusive as possible.’ The 55-year-old escaped severe sanction by writing a letter of apology to the French champion, and apologising on-air the day after the final . Culture Secretary Maria Miller demanded to know what action the BBC was taking over sexism claims . The letter was also copied to the chairman of the BBC Trust, Lord Patten. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today backed the need for more to be done to kick sexism ut of sport. Speaking on his LBC 97.3 phone-in, he said: 'Of course it’s not the role of politicians to start second-guessing what every single journalist and every single reporter says, but of course we’ve got to be clear that what we don’t want is sexism in sport and we don’t want that reflected in the way it’s supported.' He also condemned Muirfield's male only membership policy as 'inexplicable' and 'anachronistic'. 'I was just dismayed and incredibly surprised to hear this still goes on in this day and age. 'I find it so out of step with everything else that's happening in the rest of society. 'I think many people will just shake their head and say ""how on earth is this still possible in this day and age?"".' Inverdale . is already set to be replaced as the BBC’s main athletics presenter by a . woman, Gabby Logan, who agreed that his comments on Bartoli ‘wasn’t . appropriate’. The beleaguered Inverdale faced down criticism several years ago after he seemed to joke about the Duchess of Cornwall’s appearance. In a radio interview with Zara Phillips in 2006, he asked if his studio colleagues could remember the name of the horse Princess Anne rode when she won the European Championship in 1971. When no answer was forthcoming, he suggested: ‘Camilla.’ His latest comments drew a furious response from other sports stars and politicians. Men’s singles champion Andy Murray’s mother Judy described it as a ‘huge gaffe’. A BBC spokesman said: ‘The BBC has made clear that John Inverdale’s comments were unacceptable and fell well beneath the standards expected of our presenters. ‘John sincerely regrets that he made such an inappropriate statement and for the offence caused. As he said on-air the following day, he has written to Marion Bartoli to apologise and the BBC has also apologised for John’s remarks.’ He added that ‘the BBC has a proud record of supporting women’s sport, with the current coverage of Euro 2013 [the women’s football European Championships] the most recent highlight in a summer of unprecedented coverage’. Of the 16 Euro 2013 matches it will show, 14 will be on BBC Three, with just two on BBC Two. The letter was also copied to the chairman of the BBC Trust, Lord Patten . The spokesman also stressed that the BBC has appointed an ‘editorial lead’ for women’s sport ‘which has helped ensure significantly increased coverage across our daily sporting output’, while the company as a whole ‘is taking steps to clearly communicate to those who work for us what constitutes inappropriate behaviour or language’. A BBC source claimed the Inverdale controversy was a ‘one-off’. However, the outrage following the Bartoli comments does not mark the first time the BBC’s sports coverage has been criticised due to sexism. Nick Clegg said sexism had no place in sport . Jacqui Oatley, who became Match of the Day’s first woman commentator in 2007, said she had a ‘very difficult time’ due to outdated attitudes. ‘Mentally it was a huge  challenge. I didn’t enjoy it for a second, I can’t pretend I did,’ she said. The BBC also drew criticism when no women made the ten-strong shortlist for the Sports Personality of the Year award in 2011. In the row over Muirfield’s men-only policy, Mrs Miller is to be joined in her boycott of the Open by sports minister Hugh Robertson and Alex Salmond. Last weekend Mrs Miller accused golf of turning a blind eye to sexism, saying: ‘The Open Championship is the biggest tournament in golf and it sends out completely the wrong message for it to be held at clubs that don’t allow women members. ‘Sport’s governing bodies should be doing all they can to promote equality and address the sexism that still exists in some quarters, not turning a blind eye to it.’ But last night Peter Dawson, the chief executive of the Royal and Ancient, golf’s governing body, claimed the issue had been ‘beaten to death’. He said: ‘Single-sex clubs  are in a very small minority in the UK. ‘Half of them are women-only, half of them are men-only. They’re perfectly legal.’ Asked if there was any difference between only allowing men and only allowing white people, he said: ‘There’s a massive difference between racial discrimination, anti-Semitism, where sectors of society are downtrodden and treated very badly.’ He said it was a ‘normal way of life’ for a ‘guy or a lady’ to get out of their ‘marital bed’ on a Saturday morning and spend a few hours on the course with their ‘chums’.","Maria Miller sent a scathing letter to the director-general Lord Hall .

"By . Peter Allen . PUBLISHED: . 02:55 EST, 23 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:42 EST, 23 May 2013 . Former French finance minister and head of the IMF Christine Lagarde appeared in court this morning where she was expected to be formally charged with embezzlement and fraud . A French government  minister last night called on Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, to resign if she is charged with fraud and embezzlement. She was questioned by magistrates in Paris yesterday over a £340million payout of public money five years ago to convicted conman Bernard Tapie. As she appeared in court, there were calls for her to stand down from  her high-profile £305,000-a-year job if she is charged. Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, the Minister for Women’s Rights, said: ‘Knowing the IMF and the way this type of institution works, I tend to think that if she was placed under investigation, she would without doubt be asked to quit her post.’ Last night the court adjourned after 13 hours sitting but it was widely predicted Mrs Lagarde, 57, would be placed under investigation by the Court of Justice of the Republic, equivalent to a suspect being charged in the UK. She faces allegations that she stepped in to settle a long- running legal battle in which Tapie claimed he was cheated out of millions by Credit Lyonnais bank over the 1993 sale of his sportswear company Adidas. Mrs Lagarde ordered a panel of judges to arbitrate and they awarded Tapie 400million euros (£340million) in damages paid from taxpayers’ money. Prosecutors suspect Tapie received favourable treatment in return for supporting ex-president  Nicolas Sarkozy in the 2007 presidential elections. Claims: The raid relates to claims Miss Lagarde authorised a £270million payout to Bernard Tapie . They have suggested that Mrs Lagarde – . who was France’s Finance Minister at the time and the first woman ever . to hold the post – was partly responsible for ‘numerous anomalies and . irregularities’ which could amount to complicity in fraud and . misappropriation of public funds. There is no suggestion Mrs Lagarde profited personally in any way from the final settlement. The affair has become a huge embarrassment to France and the IMF. Dominique Strauss-Kahn was forced to . quit the IMF two years ago after being accused of trying to rape a hotel . chambermaid in New York, charges which were later dropped. Dispute: Mr Tapie, the former head of Adidas in France, claims he was cheated out of millions by Credit Lyonnais bank. Miss Lagarde ended the dispute by asking a panel of judges to arbitrate . Mrs Lagarde took over from ‘DSK’ almost two years ago, in July 2011. Her grilling by prosecutors comes after police raided her £1million Paris apartment in March. Mrs Lagarde’s lawyer, Yves  Repiquet, said the inquiry was ‘in no way . incompatible’ with her new job, adding that he expected the case to be . dismissed. She has denied any wrongdoing, . saying: ‘If it’s decided to continue with this inquiry it won’t be . particularly surprising. Personally, it doesn’t worry me at all – I . didn’t benefit personally.’ But it has been widely reported in the French media that investigators intend to charge her with fraud  and embezzlement. Le Monde reported that magistrates . had already written to Mrs Lagarde to tell her not to expect any special . treatment because of her high-profile international job. Tapie was jailed for six months in 1997 for corruption and match- fixing while he was the owner of  Marseilles football club.","Lagarde, 57, appears in front of special tribunal of judges in Paris .

A married Kansas City councilman has admitted to an online relationship with a woman involving graphic text messages after she allegedly tried to blackmail him for $60,000. Michael Brooks, a councilman for Kansas City's 5th District, said late Wednesday in a letter to other council members he was sorry for 'the horrible lack of judgment' in becoming involved online with the woman. But he denies the relationship had anything . to do with his decision to help bring an event to Kansas City that was . eventually cancelled and became the subject of a police investigation. Michael Brooks, a councilman for Kansas City's 5th District, said late Wednesday in a letter to other council members he was sorry for 'the horrible lack of judgment' in becoming involved online with the woman . 'It was a terrible mistake and totally out of line,' Brooks, a Baptist minister who has four children, said of the online relationship in the letter. 'However that's where the truth of the story ends.' Brooks' comments followed a report Wednesday by KSHB-TV that quoted the unidentified woman as saying she talked online with Brooks. She said some of the messages Brooks sent her included photographs of his naked torso and that she shared the photos last year with organizers of a youth event that was to feature boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. 'It was a terrible mistake and totally out of line,' Brooks, a Baptist minister who has four children, said of the online relationship . Brooks said the relationship with the woman, who was not identified and who he never met in person, did not influence his decision to help get $15,000 in city money for the Mayweather event, which was later canceled after critics said Mayweather was a bad role model because he had been accused of domestic abuse. The event's cancellation became the subject of a police investigation because the money was not recovered. Organizers said they had already used the money and were planning a substitute event. Police said in May there was no criminal wrongdoing, and no charges have been filed. Brooks claims the woman had tried to . blackmail him over the nude photos he sent. She asked him for $60,000 to . keep quiet, he said. 'As . I have stated before there is absolutely no connection between her . blackmail attempt, and the Mayweather event. ... I just want to take . this opportunity to offer my apology jeopardizing your trust, and for . disrespecting my position,' Brooks said in the message. Brooks' lawyer, John Picerno, said Thursday in a telephone interview that . Brooks and the woman exchanged emails, texts and spoke on the phone for a . few weeks after meeting online last summer. Picerno also reiterated . there was no relationship between the canceled event and the . relationship Brooks had with the woman. Picerno said Brooks had already told his wife about what had taken place online with the woman, which would have taken 'all the steam out of any efforts' to blackmail him. 'First of all, the most important thing is this thing with the woman was totally unrelated to the money that was appropriated for the Mayweather event,' Picerno said. 'It's been investigated, and they're convinced there was nothing inappropriate that occurred with public funds. As far as the private side, that's between him and his family and his wife.' Picerno questioned the woman's motives for talking to the media now. 'She's just trying to shake down whoever she could for money,' he said.","Michael Brooks, councilman for Kansas .

"By . Martha De Lacey . PUBLISHED: . 11:52 EST, 30 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:50 EST, 31 July 2013 . The recommended maximum intake of alcohol for women is between two and three units a day, and no more than 14 units a week. So it is little wonder that Patricia Murphy - who drank up to 350 units every week for 25 years - eventually ended up in hospital on a life support machine with cirrhosis of the liver, or that she is now waiting to be told if she'll need a liver transplant. Patricia, 45, lives in Chessington, Surrey, and has been sober for seven months. Feeling lucky to still be alive, the former sales assistant now wishes to tell her story, hoping to warn other women about the dangers of alcohol, the legal substance which ruined her life. At death's door: Patricia Murphy, last November, when her organs shut down as a result of cirrhosis of the liver and she had developed blood poisoning . Patricia began drinking when she was 17, after leaving school to train as a sales assistant. Naturally shy, drinking made her feel confident among her peers, and soon she was drinking 10 double brandy and Cokes at the weekends. When she started working in computer sales she was drinking alcohol every night with colleagues- sometimes up to a litre of brandy. Aged 28, both her parents died within five months of each other, and alcohol became something with which she could numb her grief. 'Alcohol blocked the pain. I'd have a glass of wine in the morning, then more throughout the day. I lived alone so there was no one to stop me. I lost my job because of it. 'I was so drunk I'd forgotten to turn up and couldn't hold down a routine. My brothers and sisters told me to cut down, but I ignored them, I was ashamed at how my life was turning out but I couldn't stop.' Soon she was drinking five bottles of wine every day, and waking up in the middle of the night sweating and shaking. She used all of her benefits money to buy alcohol, and spent all day watching TV and feeling depressed. The effects of alcohol: Patricia, who once hoped to become a model, gained four stone and was left with a blotchy, puffy face through drinking 350 units of alcohol a week . When, aged 35, she met her partner Graham, now 42, in a pub, she couldn't hide her addiction: Graham, an engineer, was teetotal. Graham's mother had been an alcoholic, and he persuaded Patricia into rehab - but as soon as she got out she headed straight to the off-license and bought a bottle of wine. 'We had huge rows and split up for a few months. But he took me back. I became a zombie, existing only for drink. I gained four stone and my face was blotchy and puffy.' Despite attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and being admitted into rehab twice over the next four years, Patricia visited the doctor last November - after much persuasion by Graham - and was told her liver was seriously damaged. What a waste: Patricia was spending all her money and time drinking wine, and now regrets not having had a career or any children . She was taken to hospital with cirrhosis and collapsed: while she was on life support Graham was told there was a five per cent chance she'd survive. A priest came to read her last rites. But against all the odds - and after a 10-week stay in hospital - Patricia was released. Despite her ordeal, the first thing she did upon release was buy wine. Luckily, she was disgusted with herself for doing it, and has been sober ever since. 'At the moment, doctors are happy with my progress, but my life expectancy will be affected. My liver is so scarred, iot will slowly stop functioning.' A scan in October will determine whether or not Patricia needs a liver transplant. 'I feel so guilty about the hurt I've caused those closest to me, I'll always regret not having a career or children.' In the beginning: Patricia began drinking brandy on weekends, but was soon drinking wine solidly throughout the day. Read her whole story in Closer, out now.

A nationwide manhunt for a child pornographer has ended with the arrest of a husband and wife accused of filming and molesting their daughters aged six and nine for swapping online. Michael Serapis Freeman, 39, and Michelle Lee Freeman, 40, surrendered to police at their home in Salem, Oregon this week after learning an acquaintance had identified Michelle from a photo circulated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement last month. Previously only identified as 'Jane Doe,' Michelle Freeman's picture was extracted from video and photos allegedly showing her victimizing the two girls, Homeland Security Investigators said. Scroll down for video . Caught: Michael Freeman, 39, and Michelle Lee Freeman, 40, surrendered to police after learning an acquaintance had identified Michelle in photos released by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in August . Michael Freeman admitted to taking nude photos of his 9-year-old daughter while performing sexual acts on her to the witness of his 6-year-old daughter, according to the criminal complaint. He described himself having been in a 'bad place' when manufacturing the content and trading it on a photo sharing website. A scan of that website by the MailOnline shows lists of users providing photos of young boys and girls, many described being under the age of 18, in provocative poses coupled with similarly fueled comments. Michael Freeman said he engaged in this file swapping of his daughter with another user for approximately one month. Identified: This 'Jane Doe' photo released last month led to the woman's arrest this week along with her husband in Oregon . 'I started it. Somehow she got involved,' he said of his wife who declined to speak with investigators. Making . their first court appearance in Portland on Wednesday, the couple have . been charged with sexual exploitation of children while producing child . pornography. During the nation-wide search for Michelle Freeman, ICE agents were granted a criminal complaint and federal warrant from a U.S. District Court Judge in Washington, D.C. to arrest the woman. ICE agents from Los Angeles, California, had been working on the investigation since June 2011 when they executed a search warrant and seized a computer with images that they said depicted the child victims being abused. Similarities: The appeal by federal agents has echoes of an earlier hunt for a mystery boy pictured in this still released by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations unit . The case has echoes of a similar appeal by the same ICE unit, which in June released a still of a mystery boy who they said was in serious danger. Days after that appeal an arrest was made. The ICE Homeland Security Investigations is responsible for investigating crime connected to the illegal movement of goods and people into and out of the United States. Agents target criminal networks smuggling people and drugs across America's borders. It has 6,700 agents spread throughout 200 American cities and 47 overseas outposts. A break in the 'Jane Doe' investigation came in June of 2012, when the FBI in Colorado said it seized a computer that had over 200 images and two videos of the child victims with the images of accused suspect Michelle Freeman. The then-unidentified male in the images has his face obscured and digitally altered in the files, according to an affidavit by HSI Special Agent Jim Cole, who has been working the investigation. According to their investigation, the male suspect seen was believed to have interest in the outdoors based on a book Animal Tracking Basics which appears in the background of the video. Investigators say they believe the pictures were taken in February of 2010. Officials said the case is unusual since a majority of child pornography cases involve male suspects, not women.

JP Morgan's 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza is now on the market with a price tag expected to be close to $1 billion. The 60-floor skyscraper was built in 1961 and is the 15th tallest building in New York City but it is what lays below ground that captures the imagination. Some 90 feet below street level is where the formerly secret JPM gold vault is located. Striking gold: The New York skyscraper that holds the worlds largest gold vault is on the market. 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza was built in the 1950s. The vault is 90ft underground . On the move: 4,000 of JP Morgan Chase workers will have to relocate one the building is sold . The building that was built by David Rockefeller in the late 1950s was the headquarters of the once-legendary Chase Manhattan corporation. When it was completed, the building was the world's sixth tallest building. One of the building architects wrote that underneath the skyscraper is the '...largest bank vault in the world, longer than a football field.' More information about the vault can be found in a book that was written by one of the architects. It describes how the vault was anchored to the bedrock with steel rods. Hidden: There are no clues on the surface as to the size or amount of gold held in the enormous vault below .

Reach for the skies: The building is New York City's 15th tallest building with 60 floors at a height of 813 feet . This was to prevent the watertight, concrete structure from floating to the surface like a huge bubble in the event that an atomic bomb falling in the bay would blow away the building and flood the area. In other words, the world's biggest bank vault, that belonging to the private Chase Manhattan empire, and then, to JPMorgan, was so safe, the creators even had a plan of action should it sustain a near-direct hit from a nuclear bomb, and suffer epic flooding (such as that from Hurricane Sandy). Conveniently, across the street lays the Federal Reserve Bank of New York - the largest gold repository in the world. JPMorgan Chase & Co. currently occupies about half of the 2.2 million-square-foot building. It means their 4,000 employees will have to be re-located elsewhere. Building with potential: There are suggestions the building could be turned into a hotel, shops and apartments. Some have suggested the vault would make a nice restaurant! Up for grabs: The building was for sale once before but was pulled after the market crashed in 2008 . The building was up for sale once before, in 2008, after the market crash.

It is a story of survival against all the odds which ranks as one of the most extraordinary in military history. Now the little-known events surrounding the incredible service of Commander Ian Forbes, who was sunk four times and lived through a . brutal prisoner of war camp, has been revealed as  his collection of wartime medals go on sale. Just like Uncle Albert from Only Fools and Horses, Cdr Forbes down with nearly every ship he served on during World War II. He saw numerous comrades killed but managed to dodge the torpedoes, shell fire and strafing by enemy aircraft. The officer escaped shark-infested seas and even swam away from one uninhabited desert island only to very nearly be executed by restless natives on another. He also witnessed at close hand the Allies’ worst naval disaster of the war; the sinking of HMS Hood with the loss of 1,400 men by the German battleship Bismarck, which then turned its guns on his vessel. Cdr Forbes was eventually captured by the Japanese after the sinking of his final ship in March 1942 and then suffered three years of hell at the hands of his savage guards. Like hundreds of other prisoners held by the Japanese, the Royal Navy officer was regularly beaten, punished and tortured but was fortunate enough to survive. Immediately after the war he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his ‘great courage’ while serving on two of his previous ships. He died in 1992 aged 73. His medal group has been in the hands of a collector of gallantry medals who is now selling them at auction. They have a pre-sale estimate of £5,000. Survivor: Commander Ian Forbes was among the stricken seamen, pictured, abandoning the sinking Prince of Wales, but survived the incident . David Erskine-Hill, of London . auctioneers Dix Noonan and Webb, said: 'The war at sea produced some . extraordinary tales of survival, among them those of men who escaped . unscathed from torpedoed ships on more than one occasion.

Glittering service: The medals of decorated war hero Commander Ian Forbes, pictured from left to right, DSC, WW2 star, Atlantic star, Africa star, Pacific star, War medal, Naval GSM and Coronation medal, are to be auctioned . During the war: Just like a real life Uncle Albert, pictured left from Only Fools and Horses, Cdr Forbes managed to survive the sinking of nearly every ship he served on during World War II . Cdr Forbes entered the navy in 1933 and by the outbreak of the war he was a sub-lieutenant on the escort vessel HMS Bittern. The ship was sunk off Norway in April . 1940 after being attacked by German Stuka planes. The survivors were . picked up by the destroyer HMS Janus. He . was promoted to lieutenant and moved to the battleship HMS Prince of . Wales which, alongside HMS Hood, was attacked by the Bismarck in May . 1941. The Prince of Wales . would have suffered the same fate as Hood had its captain not withdrawn . from the battle having been hit by four shells with the loss of 13 men. The . ship was later relocated to the Far East but she was sunk off Malaysia . in December 1941 after coming under attack by Japanese bombers. Some . 327 men were killed in the action. Cdr Forbes scrambled into a rubber . dinghy and was later rescued by a navy destroyer and taken to Singapore. Fierce battle: Cdr Forbes survived the sinking of HMS Hood, a battlecruiser, pictured during a manoeuvres exercise, which was sunk in May 1941 with the loss of 1,400 . Two months later he was on the last ship to depart from Singapore Island during the Fall of Singapore. The river gunboat, HMS Grasshopper, was crippled by a hit from a Japanse bomber and then attacked by 30 fighter planes. In . his official report, Cdr Forbes later wrote: 'I began to realise that I . had a charmed life. For some reason I changed position at the last . minute a couple of paces to port. 'The bomb dropped. Where I had just been was riddled with large holes. I only got a small graze on my right forearm.' The . ship beached at Lingga Island in the South China Sea. Many survived . only to be cut down in the water or on the beach when they were strafed . by the enemy planes. Cdr Forbes was one of 24 survivors and he and a Malay sailor swam to a neighbouring island to find help. He . wrote: 'When I swam from the desert island on which we were beached to a . neighouring island, which was inhabited, a Malay sailor volunteered to . come with me and his astute handling of his fellow countrymen saved my . life. 'On first meeting me . they were of a mind to put me to death. Through his intervention they . changed their minds and became most helpful.' Resilient: Commander Ian Forbes survived his first sinking while on HMS Bittern, pictured smoking after being hit, only to escape from going down with his ship on three more occasions during World War II . The officer was later transferred to the destroyer HMS Stronghold which was involved in the disastrous battle of the Java Sea in which 2,300 Allies sailors were killed. Five minutes after abandoning ship following a torpedo attack, he watched from a life raft as another torpedo blew the vessel up. This time he and the other survivors were picked up by the Japanese. He spent the next three-and-a-half years in PoW camps in the Far East. After the war he became the British naval attache to Sweden and served in NATO before retiring to Dumfriesshire. His medals will be auctioned on June 19 in London.","Commander Ian Forbes went down with nearly every ship he served on .

A remarkable photo album showing German airmen quaffing champagne and getting steaming drunk during the First World War have been come to light. The black and white snaps depict the men in uniform having a raucous time in their mess, far removed from the misery of the trenches on the Western Front. The officers of the Imperial German Flying Corps are seen smoking cigars and cigarettes and having a good old knees up in the incredibly rare photo collection which is being put up for auction. A rip-roaring good time: Members of the Imperial German Flying Corps can be seen swigging champagne and smoking cigars in Christmas 1917 during the First World War . Dangerous job: It seems the German pilots adopted a similar philosophy to their British counterparts: 'Live for today, tomorrow we die' Finally found: The unique images of the German pilots kept in a 14inch by 12inch album were found in a box of personal effects inherited by a man in Essex from a relative. It is believed the album was kept by a British serviceman after the Germans surrendered in 1918 . Coming just 11 years after the first ever flight by the Wright brothers, air warfare was a new but very risky concept during the First World War. It was said the men of the British Royal Flying Corps’ adopted the philosophy of ‘live for today, tomorrow we die’, such was the deadly nature of their job. And judging by the dozens of rare photos that have emerged, it seems their German counterparts also had a similar attitude to wartime life. There are several group photos depicting the men guzzling bottles of champagne and glasses of beer and liquor. In one amusing image, all 10 German . officers appear to be in a drunken stupour, with four of them hugging . each other and singing out loud while another looks like he has passed . out. In another, a line of four inebriated flyers lean to one side as they lose their balance while sitting for the camera. The large album contains about 130 snaps and others do show the serious side of the war. There is a poignant picture of the grave of one German airman with a plane propeller placed on it as a marker. Another photo shows two airmen wrapped . up in large overcoats and scarfs as they prepare to climb into the . exposed cockpit of their bi-plane and go into battle. Wartime life: German pilots can be seen drinking pints of beer while other play give a live performance on their instruments in this group photograph . On a mission: Two unidentified German pilots pictured in front of their bi-plane in thick coats and scarves ahead of flying in to battle . And several snaps some of the devastating damage to train lines and bridges as a result of air bombing over norther France. The identities of the airmen aren’t known although they were part of 24 and 54 squadrons of the German Flying Corps or the Die Fliegertruppen. It is known that some of the photos were taken in December 1917 as a Christmas tree and decorations can be seen in them. Some of the pilots' obvious mantra to live life to the fullest is not surprising considering the high mortality rate for those in the air force. During World War One, aircrew casualties, who were killed, missing or taken prisoner, totalled 8,604 and a further 7,302 were wounded. By the end of the war, the German Army . Air Service possessed a total of 2,709 frontline aircraft, 56 airships, . 186 balloon detachments and about 4,500 flying personnel. In total 3,126 aircraft, 546 . balloons and 26 airships had been lost during the duration of the conflict. After the war ended in German defeat, . the service was dissolved completely on May 8, 1920, under the . conditions of the Treaty of Versailles, which demanded that its . aeroplanes be completely destroyed.

Memorial: A poignant photograph showing a plane propeller being use to mark a pilot's makeshift grave during the First World War . The rare collection of photos contained in a 14ins by 12ins album was found in a box of personal effects inherited by a man in Essex from a late relative. It is thought the album was seized as a souvenir by a British serviceman after the Germans surrendered in 1918 and was kept in his family. It is being sold by Essex auctioneers Reeman Dansie and has a pre-sale estimate of £1,500. James Grinter, of Reeman Dansie, said: 'I have never seen anything like this photo album before. 'If it was a Royal Flying Corps album, then it would be rare but to have a German one from the same period is unheard of. 'The survival rate of these flyers was terrible and it looks like these men lived life to the full while they had the chance. 'It is a very important and historical record and is unusual because there are a lot of natural and relaxed pictures rather than the staged and formal photos of that period. 'It gives you a feel of what it was like to have been there. It wouldn’t surprise me if this album ended up going into a museum because it is so rare.'  The auction takes place on Thursday.

Legendary: German fighter pilot Baron Manfred von Richthofen, better known as the 'Red Baron', was considered to be one of the best flyers in World War One with 80 air combat victories to his name . The Imperial German Flying Corps . (IGFC) - Die Fliegertruppen des deutschen Kaiserreiches in German - was . founded in 1910 when the Germany acquired its first military aircraft. They were initially responsible for . reconnaissance and artillery spotting in support of armies on the . ground, just as balloons had been used during the Franco-Prussian War of . 1870–1871 and even as far back as the Napoleonic Wars. The IGFC formed the basis of what would become the German Air Force (Deutsche Luftstreitkräfte) in 1916, which was the air arm of the German army during World War One. The Air Force drastically expanded . during the war to accommodate the new types of aircraft, doctrine, . tactics and the needs of the ground troops, in particularly the . artillery. During . 1916, the German High Command, in response to the then current Allied . air superiority, reorganised their forces by creating several types of . specialist units in 1916. Most . notable were the single seat fighter squadrons or 'Jastas' which is . short for Jagdstaffel - literally meaning 'hunting squadron' - in order . to counter the offensive operations of the Royal Flying Corps and the . French Aviation Militaire. On . June 24, 1917, the Luftstreitkräfte formed its first fighter wing, the . Royal Prussian Jagdgeschwader I and more units quickly followed. And just like their British counterpart, the German Air Force had famous fighter pilots who inspired bravery in their comrades and struck fear into the heart of the enemy. And Manfred Albrecht Freiherr von Richthofen, better known as the Red Baron, was considered to be the best. The German fighter pilot is considered German's top ace of World War One - being officially credited with 80 air combat victories. Originally a cavalryman, Richthofen transferred to the Air Service in 1915, becoming one of the first members of Jasta 2 single seat fighter pilots in 1916. He quickly distinguished himself as a fighter pilot, and during 1917 became leader of Jasta 11 and then the larger unit Jagdgeschwader 1 - better known as the 'Flying Circus'. By 1918, he was regarded as a national hero in Germany, and was very well known by the other side. Richthofen was shot down and killed near Amiens on 21 April 1918. There has been considerable discussion and debate regarding aspects of his career, especially the circumstances of his death. He remains perhaps the most widely known fighter pilot of all time, and has been the subject of many books, films and other media. By . the end of the war, the German Army Air Service possessed a total of . 2,709 frontline aircraft, 56 airships, 186 balloon detachments and about . 4,500 flying personnel. Casualties . totalled 8,604 aircrew killed or missing or taken prisoner, 7,302 . wounded with 3,126 aircraft, 546 balloons and 26 airships lost.

Nurses at the disgraced Stafford Hospital who left an elderly woman to die and then recorded that she was just sleeping have been allowed to keep their jobs. Evelyn Agbeko and Theresia Van Der Knaap escaped being struck off at a hearing yesterday despite being found guilty of serious blunders at the hospital. They will now be free to keep treating vulnerable patients after a disciplinary hearing ruled that despite their failings they still ‘have a contribution to make’ as nurses. Scandal: The panel chair said that Ms Agbeko put a patient at serious risk of harm and broke fundamental tenets of the profession and brought the profession into disrepute . The verdicts stunned campaigners, who . said allowing them to keep practising sent a ‘dangerous message’ to . those in the health service whose incompetence has claimed lives. Up to 1,200 patients were believed to have died unnecessarily at Stafford Hospital over three years. A previous hearing heard that in April 2010 Agbeko and Van Der Knaap . failed to provide  basic life support for an 81- year-old woman they . found unresponsive. As the pensioner’s life drained away, they did not start chest compressions or call doctors. After the patient died, Van Der Knaap, from Holland, remarked: ‘In my country, if they have died, then they have died.’ Agbeko recorded that the woman was sleeping after she had died. She later said it was a mistake and that there was also confusion over whether there was a ‘do not resuscitate’ order in place. The pair claimed they had been forced to cut corners after hospital bosses reduced staffing levels. Agbeko said she would often work a 15-hour shift without a break. Overworked: The nurses at Stafford Hospital said they had been forced to cut corners after staffing numbers were slashed, adding that they would work 15 hours without a break .

British families will be forced to spend less on holiday this half-term as the sterling slumps against the euro, a survey has revealed. Tourists in Tenerife and Ayia Napa, Cyprus, will have to keep a closer eye on their cash than holidaymakers in Spain's Costa del Sol. Of six popular destinations surveyed by Post Office Travel Money, Spain’s Costa del Sol offers the best value for money. Budgets: Families going away this half term may have to watch what they spend depending on where they are . Combining the cost of a half-term family holiday package for two adults and two children with meals and drinks for one week, a Costa del Sol break costs £1,108. The Portuguese Algarve (£1,137) was close behind, followed by Majorca (£1,210). But budgets will be imperative for families flying to Marmaris in Turkey (£1,395), Ayia Napa in Cyprus (£1,619) and Tenerife (£2,186), where the recent change has shown a greater effect overall. The Costa del Sol was cheapest overall with the lowest package prices and resort costs, but prices for meals and drinks were also low in the Algarve and Tenerife. Eating out costs more in Marmaris, but lower package holiday prices make the top Turkish resort less expensive than Ayia Napa or Tenerife. Cost effective: Nerja in Costa del Sol, Spain, is a destination where families will get more for their cash this year . But the sterling's slump against the euro hit Tenerife harder and families travelling there will have to budget . Families planning a half-term trip to Marmaris will also find their pounds stretch further as sterling currently buys 7.6% more Turkish lira than a year ago - the equivalent of more than £35 on a £500 exchange. Elsewhere in Europe, while meals and drinks cost only 4% more in Tenerife than in the Algarve, higher half-term package prices push Tenerife into sixth place - 35% more expensive than Ayia Napa and almost twice as much as the Costa del Sol. Andrew Brown, of Post Office Travel Money, said: 'Our new research proves just how important it is for families to check all costs when it comes to choosing a last-minute half-term destination. 'The combination of low resort costs and cheap packages make the Costa del Sol best value overall, but with holiday prices changing all the time, the Algarve and Majorca are still worthy contenders this half term.'","Poll revealed families will have to tighten budget over half-term holiday .

Plans by the Iranian government to switch its citizens' internet to a domestic network to 'improve security' have been described as a deliberate attempt to control their access to the web. Officials said the move will improve the country's protection against cyber attacks, but many Iranians believe it is the latest tactic to restrict and filter information online. The announcement was made by a government deputy minister on Sunday and came as state television announced Google Inc's search engine and its email service would be blocked 'within a few hours'. Vital communication tool: Dissidents in Iran have previously used social networks, like Twitter, to organise demonstrations (file picture) In the televised announcement, an official - identified only by his last name, Khoramabadi - said: 'Google and Gmail will be filtered throughout the country until further notice.' No further details were given. The Google ban was thought to be connected to the anti-Islamic film posted on the company's YouTube site which has caused outrage throughout the Muslim world, according to the Iranian Students' News Agency (ISNA). However, there was no official confirmation of this. Iran has one of the biggest Internet filters of any country in the world, preventing normal Iranians from accessing countless sites on the official grounds they are offensive or criminal. However, many Iranians believe the block on sites such as Facebook and YouTube is due to their use in anti-government protests after the disputed re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009. Sites expressing views considered anti-government are also routinely blocked. Virtual private network (VPN) software, which makes the computer appear as if it is based in another country, is commonly used by Iranians to overcome the government filter. However, officials have long spoken of creating an Iranian Internet system which would be largely isolated from the World Wide Web. Protesters march during a silent demonstration against the results of the 2009 Iranian presidential election in central Tehran. Dissidents used the internet to garner support . Blocked: An announcement on state television revealed filters on Google and Gmail in Iran 'until further notice' Ali Hakim-Javadi, deputy communications and technology minister, said: 'In recent days, all governmental agencies and offices ... have been connected to the national information network.' He added that the second phase of the plan would be to connect ordinary Iranians to the national network. According to Iranian media, the domestic system would be fully implemented by March 2013 but it was not clear whether access to the global Internet would be cut once the Iranian system is rolled out. Anti-government protests took place after the disputed re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (pictured) Even using VPNs, many Iranians suffered serious problems accessing email and social networking sites in February, ahead of parliamentary elections. Cyber security was tightened by the Islamic Republic after its nuclear programme was attacked in 2010 by the Stuxnet computer worm, which caused centrifuges to fail at its main uranium enrichment facility. Tehran, whose nuclear programme is suspected by the West of being aimed at developing a bomb, accused the United States and Israel of deploying the worm. In April, authorities claimed a computer virus was detected inside the control systems of Kharg Island - which handles the vast majority of Iran's crude oil exports - but the terminal remained operational. Last month Reza Taqipour, Iran's communications and technology minister, said Iran needed to develop its own network to ensure the safety of the country's information. He added: 'Control over the Internet should not be in the hands of one or two countries. Especially on major issues and during crises, one cannot trust this network at all.' In May, Iran threatened to take legal action against Google over its decision to drop the term 'Persian Gulf' from its Google Maps and leaving the waterway between Iran and the Arabian peninsula nameless. Many Arab states refer to the sea as the 'Arabian Gulf', a term Iran considers unacceptable. Iran is no stranger to internet censorship. In a country known for the oppression of its own people, fears over this latest move are, perhaps, unsurprising. Earlier this year internet links were mysteriously cut - leaving millions without email and social network access - as rumours of planned anti-government protests circulated. Gmail, Google and Yahoo were all thought to have been restricted and users were locked out of their online banking accounts. For dissidents opposing the Islamic Republic's leadership, the internet has become one of the most powerful communication tools at their disposal. Demonstrations have been orchestrated using blogs and social networks to gather support and increase numbers. Shocking: Millions saw Neda Agha Soltan die in Tehran after footage was uploaded to YouTube . But, perhaps more importantly, the web has also been a crucial outlet for citizens to expose their oppression to the outside world. Events that would have otherwise been shielded from Western eyes have been revealed to the international community, much to the anger of the government. At no time has this been more obvious than during demonstrations in the wake of the 2009 elections, when thousands took to the streets to protest against the disputed victory of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. As Iran played down events to outsiders, dissidents used Twitter, Facebook and YouTube to tell the world what was really happening. The most shocking example of this was the death of music student Neda Agha Soltan, whose murder at the hands of a government militiaman was captured on a camera phone and uploaded to YouTube in 2009. Millions watched horrific footage of the 26-year-old, who had been taking part in a peaceful protest in Tehran, as she was shot through the heart by a sniper and died minutes later in a pool of blood.","Officials claim filtered access to the web will protect Iran from cyber attacks .

Now, a scientist has claimed that Earth effectively 'gave birth' to the moon four-and-a-half billion years ago. A controversial new theory has been proposed that a giant explosion equivalent to 40 billion atomic bombs originating from the Earth's core somehow led to the formation of the moon. Planetary scientist Wim van Westrenen believes this violent event took place approximately four-and-a-half billion years ago and could answer the hotly contested question of where our moon comes from. A Dutch scientist has claimed that the moon was created by massive nuclear blast which tore apart our planet four billion years ago . The scientist, from VU University in Amsterdam, told New Scientist magazine that previous explanations about how the moon came to be simply do not add up. Charles Darwin's son, astronomer George Darwin, proposed that the early Earth spun so fast that it fell apart, hurling a part of itself into space that became the moon. His theory was popular but was then eclipsed by the giant impact hypothesis, or 'big splat', which said that a Mars-sized object crashed into an infant Earth and shattered on impact, the magazine reported. In this theory, the debris formed the moon. However, it was largely thrown-out when astronauts brought back rocks from the Apollo moon landings. George Darwin, astronomer son of famous scientist Charles (pictured) proposed that the early Earth spun so fast that it fell apart, hurling a part of itself into space that became the moon . Chemical analysis of the rocks last year by the University of Chicago found that they shared identical oxygen, silicon and potassium isotopes with Earth, hinting that the Moon shares its origin with the Earth. Van Westeren said that taken at face . value, the findings suggest that the moon was once part of the Earth . that was blasted into space by an enormous explosion from the Earth's . fiery core. To do this, he believes that there must have been a 'massive energy kick' delivered quickly and he calculates that the explosion was the strength of 40 billion atomic bombs the size of those dropped on Hiroshima. The idea that the Earth's core harbours a huge nuclear reactor has been around for over 60 years. There is also evidence of much smaller natural fossil reactors up to 10 metres across in West Africa that were active around 10 billion years ago. Van Westeren said that: 'A nuclear blast is the only thing we could come up with that could produce the necessary energy quickly enough' to blast the moon into space. Scientists have reasoned that heavy elements like uranium and plutonium in heavy rocks sank deep into the Earth after it was formed and collected on its outer core where they formed large liquid reservoirs. The radioactive material in the rocks set off mini reactions, which when combined with enough fuel, produced an enormous explosion. View of the Earth from the moon. There have been numerous theories about how the moon was formed including the 'big splat' theory that a Mars-sized piece of rock collided with the Earth and the moon was formed from its debris . This theory of  an internal nuclear reactor could explain why Earth gives out more energy than it receives from the sun. However, experts have said that even if evidence of 'global georeactors' was found, many scientists would need convincing that they were capable of creating the moon. There are many conflicting ideas of exactly how the moon came to be and scientists are starting to re-question older theories. Matija Cuk, a planetary scientist at Harvard University said: 'I don't think you can separate the moon's formation from a giant impact.' But he draws upon Darwin's idea and the big splat and believes that a peculiar alignment of the sun, earth and moon is the reason why the moon orbits the Earth.","Controversial new theory suggests that a giant .

Starting with President Obama, Mr Graham- son of the most famous televangelist Reverend Billy Graham- said that while he does say that he is a Christian, and may go to church when the cameras are watching, there are also signs that he has Muslim leanings. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Controversial comments: Reverend Franklin Graham appeared on Morning Joe Tuesday when he waffled on President Obama's faith and said that Mormonism isn't the same as Christianity . The Reverend hedged slightly throughout, saying that while Mr Obama has told him personally that he is a Christian and Mr Graham chooses to take him at his word, he still does have some reservations about how sincere the President is about his faith. 'I think you have to ask President Obama,' Mr Graham told the hosts of MSNBC's show Morning Joe. 'He has said he’s a Christian, so I just have to assume that he is. 'You have to go by what a person says and how they live their life and where they go to church. Are they faithful church-goers? Or do they just go when the cameras are on them.' He then claimed that Mr Obama did not regularly attend a church in Chicago until he needed to in order to be accepted by the community of voters. These claims come on the heels of Republican candidate Rick Santorum questioning- and then readdressing the comments- President Obama's faith. Meeting of approval: President Obama met with the elder Reverend Graham in 2010 . Like father, like son: Billy Graham, who is now 93 years old, was a pioneer in televangelism and his son Franklin (right) has become a big name in his own right . Mr Graham then projected his comments onto Mr Obama's foreign policy dealings and sensativity to Muslim issues. 'Under Islamic law–Sharia law–Islam sees him as a son of Islam. Because his father was a Muslim, his grandfather was a Muslim...That's just the way it works,' he said. 'But, of course, he says he didn’t grow up that way, he doesn’t believe in that, he believes in Jesus Christ, so I accept that.' The famed preacher then moved on to talk about the current crop of Republican presidential candidates, and continued his controversial assessment. When asked if Mitt Romney was a Christian, Mr Graham responded 'He is a Mormon'. Not the same: Mr Graham said that 'most Christians would not recognize Mormonism as part of the Christian faith' 'Most Christians would not recognize Mormonism as part of the Christian faith. 'Of course, (Mormons) believe in Jesus Christ. But they believe in a lot of other things, too, that we don't accept.' From that point on, Mr Graham focused on the positive, saying that he would approve of Mr Romney, Mr Santorum, or Mr Gingrich as the Republican nominee. Ron Paul- who is also still in the race- was not mentioned at all during the interview. Mr Graham credited Mr Romney with 'the strength, business-wise, politics-wise' to be a good President. And even though Mr Gingrich has been married three times- and, as the Reverent put it, 'has those issues'- he is still 'A Christian. At least he told me he is'. The field: Mr Graham said that he had spoken with both Mr Gingrich (left) and Mr Santorum (right) about their faith, and believed he was closest to Mr Santorum in terms of judgement on moral issues . His strongest religious endorsement, however, went to Mr Santorum, with whom he is aligned most closely with. 'I would say on moral issues, no question, Rick Santorum,' Mr Graham said. 'He's a very sharp guy as far as his Christian faith being more in line but all of them are when it comes to policy and running the country. 'You’ve got to have a person make good decisions that are best for all of us, and I think all the candidates that are running are capable men,' he said, trying to sound supportive of all three without choosing sides. Considering the constant ebb and flow of the race, remaining neutral may be the smartest move. On Tuesday evening, Gallup had Mr Santorum leading with 36 per cent of the Republican vote, Mr Romney in second with 26 per cent, and Mr Gingrich in third with 14 per cent. WATCH THE VIDEO HERE .

Zimbabwe has signed a secret deal to supply Uranium to Iran for its controversial nuclear programme, according to a senior Government source in Harare. Negotiations between the two countries, which would see thousands of tonnes of the raw uranium shipped to Tehran for enrichment, have allegedly been going on for two years, the Times reports. Zimbabwe's Deputy Mining Minister Gift Chimanikire, said a 'memorandum of understanding' had been signed between the two countries both currently subject to stringent international sanctions. Concerns: Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe, seen here shaking hands with former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2006, is believed to have signed a secret deal to supply uranium to Tehran . The deal would see thousands of tonnes of raw uranium shipped to Tehran . for enrichment in a flagrant breech of international sanctions. Iranian president Hasan Rouhani has refused to consider halting the country's nuclear programme . Iran insists that its nuclear programme is solely for providing its domestic energy needs, however it is widely believed they are hoping to build a nuclear weapon. Mr Chimanikire described mining as 'Zimbabwe's ticket' and said only a small number of government officials were aware of the deal which would mean the African country receiving billions in desperately needed currency. Enrichment plant: Iran's Uranium Conversion Facility, just outside the city of Isfahan . He said a Chinese company had been . carrying out tests at a site in the far north of Zimbabwe.He told the . Times: 'I have seen a [memorandum of understanding] to export uranium to . the Iranians.' Zimbabwe is believed to have uranium reserves of around 45,000 tonnes. However much of it is mixed in with other minerals meaning it would take years to extract and at considerable expense. The Chinese are also believed to have approached Zimbabwe offering finance and construction projects in return for mining rights. Although Iran has its own uranium deposits they are not as pure as those found in other parts of the world. Experts believe the Islamic state has already stockpiled 182kg of enriched uranium, but would require around 250kg to build a nuclear bomb. Following his inauguration in June, Iran's new president Hasan Rouhani Iran's promised to follow a 'path of moderation' and bring more openness over the country's nuclear programme. But he stopped short of saying they would consider halting the uranium enrichment programme and accused the United States of seeking any excuse to confront the country over its nuclear ambitions. They insist the programme is peaceful and geared soley towards generating electricity and producing radioisotopes to treat cancer patients. Mr Rouhani's predecessor Mahmoud . Ahmadinejad, met with President Mugabe in 2010, when the African leader . described the Iranian's nuclear ambitions as a 'just cause'. Before stepping down in June Mr Ahmadinejad, took a foreign trip to Niger, the world's fourth-largest uranium producer. Precious cargo: Iranian technicians huddle around a container of 'yellow cake' uranium in 2005 . British security officials said they were aware that Iran was negotiating with Zimbabwe. A foreign office spokesman said: 'Any reports of uranium being supplied to Iran are concerning.' Iran has six uranium enrichment plants and are also understood to have activated a heavy-water production plant to produce plutonium for a nuclear bomb. But satellite images showed clouds of steam emerging from the site, which is 150 miles south-west of the capital Tehran.","Negotiations between the countries have allegedly gone on for two years .

Mr Carney has said he wants to get the economy up to 'escape velocity' during his five year tenure in London . Britain’s economic recovery gathered pace yesterday in a boost to Mark Carney in his first week as governor of the Bank of England. A closely-watched survey showed the construction industry grew at its fastest pace for more than a year last month - fuelling hopes that the UK is finally on the mend more than five years after the financial crisis struck. The purchasing managers’ index of activity in the sector - where scores above 50 represent growth - rose from 50.8 in May to 51 in June having spent months in negative territory. The good news for British builders came a day after the index for British manufacturers hit a 25-month high of 52.5. The emergence of ‘green shoots’ will be welcomed by Canadian Mr Carney, who became the 319-year-old central bank’s first foreign governor when he succeeded Sir Mervyn King on Monday. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency experts World First, said: ‘Mark Carney has the gift of good timing it seems.’ Mr Carney, who was poached from the Bank of Canada by George Osborne and will earn £874,000 a year, took the Tube to the Bank’s Threadneedle Street headquarters again yesterday morning having dined with the Chancellor the night before at Number 11. Mr Carney has said he wants to get the economy up to ‘escape velocity’ during his five year tenure in London. It is thought the 48-year-old, a former executive at Goldman Sachs described as ‘the outstanding central banker of his generation’ by Mr Osborne, will deploy aggressive new tactics to bolster growth. Mr Osborne wants the Canadian to provide ‘monetary activism’ to underpin a lasting recovery in time for the 2015 general election. It is thought the 48-year-old, a former executive at Goldman Sachs, will deploy aggressive new tactics to bolster growth . But experts said his first meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, which has already slashed interest rates to a record low of 0.5 per cent and pumped £375billion of emergency funds into the economy through quantitative easing, could pass without incident this week given signs the recovery is picking up pace. Chris Beauchamp, an analyst at trading firm IG, said: ‘Mark Carney couldn’t really have timed his arrival any better. At his first meeting of the MPC this week, he will be able to point to signs of life among the previously moribund landscape of the British economy.’ Canadian Mr Carney became the 319-year-old central bank's first foreign governor when he succeeded Sir Mervyn King . Research group Capital Economics yesterday raised its growth forecasts for the UK. It said it now expects the economy to grow by 0.8 per cent this year - far better than its earlier forecast of 0.2 per cent. But with the eurozone in crisis and the outlook in Britain uncertain many observers believe Mr Carney will still be keen to make his mark to bolster growth. It is thought the Bank could target unemployment as well as inflation and start issuing so-called ‘forward guidance’ to reassure households and businesses that interest rates will stay low for a long time to come. Mr Carney is also under pressure to tackle the lending drought crippling British firms - an issue highlighted by the Daily Mail’s Make the Banks Lend campaign. Figures from the Bank on Monday showed lending to UK businesses fell by £1.3billion in May in a major threat to the recovery. Philip Shaw, an economist at banking group Investec, said: ‘The problem is that we have had false starts before. Moreover any growth that we have had since the end of the recession in 2009 has been lacklustre. Hence there is a clear motivation for the new governor to want to add more stimulus rather than allowing the committee to cross its collective fingers in the hope that nothing goes wrong this time.’ Rob Wood, an economist at Berenberg Bank, said: ‘We are optimistic about the UK’s potential for growth. The UK can and will recover. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Households are still facing the huge challenge of sharply falling real wages. ‘The recent stronger data do not rule out further Bank of England action. Rather, it is probably an incentive to keep expectations of interest rate as low as possible for the foreseeable future, to ensure the recovery becomes entrenched.’ Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said that expectations for Mr Carney have been set too high. A closely-watched survey showed the construction industry grew at its fastest pace for more than a year last month - fuelling hopes that the UK is finally on the mend . He said: ‘To quote Monty Python, he’s not the Messiah and he can’t work miracles. There is too much expectation being heaped on the new governor.’ David Noble, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, which published the construction figures with research group Markit, hailed a ‘new dawn’ for British builders after years of recession. ‘A new dawn is emerging in the construction industry, with confidence of a sustained recovery beginning to build,’ he said, adding that housebuilding was the ‘leading light’ thanks to government schemes to bolster mortgage lending such as Funding for Lending and Help to Buy. Official figures later this month are likely to show that growth in the second quarter of the year was stronger than the 0.3 per cent clocked up in the first three months as the recovery gathers pace.","A survey showed the construction industry grew at its fastest pace for more than a year last month - fuelling hopes that the UK is finally on the mend .

Audacious: Reece Scobie (pictured) duped leading travel companies to pay for a six-month globe-trotting spree . It was a lavish con worthy of actor Leonardo DiCaprio’s character in hit movie Catch Me If You Can. Teenager Reece Scobie repeatedly jetted around the world, flying business class and staying in luxury hotels, after duping his travel agent bosses. And, as with DiCaprio’s film character Frank Abagnale jr, who posed as an airline pilot to travel the world, the 19-year-old proved adept at living on his wits. Scobie spent more than £70,000 on a jetset lifestyle by conning his former travel agent bosses, a rival travel company, and even Scottish court officials. He booked business-class flights to destinations around the world, including Singapore and Los Angeles, during a six-month spending spree. The teenage conman, who lives with his mother in Rait, Perthshire, also booked round-the-world trips taking in Dubai, Auckland, New York and Vancouver. While he was being investigated, Scobie even managed to dupe court staff into handing back his passport which had been confiscated as a condition of bail. The teenager only worked for Thomson Travel for two months but continued to use the company’s passwords to book flights and hotels after leaving his job. Perth Sheriff Court heard that Scobie has, according to his lawyer, been diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome. Scroll down for video . Singapore: Scobie used Cambridge Business Travel's booking system to arrange flights to a number of destinations, including Singapore . Dubai: Scobie used both his own name and a series of aliases to book the rooms at locations including Dubai . The hearing was told that he used both his own name and a series of aliases to book the rooms. He treated two of his friends to a night in a luxury hotel. On one occasion, he was in a British Airways airport lounge and spotted that the previous user of a computer there, who worked for Cambridge Business Travel, had not properly logged off. Scobie was able to gain access to the . company’s booking system and used it to arrange flights to LA, New York, . Atlanta, Abu Dhabi and Singapore. Movie: The con was worthy of Leonardo DiCaprio's character Frank Abagnale jr in the film Catch Me If You Can . It was while Scobie was in Los Angeles that irregularities came to light and his return flight was cancelled, forcing him to borrow cash to pay for a flight home. Scobie admitted two charges of fraud by obtaining services, flights and accommodation while employed at Thomson Travel in Perth. He . also admitted that between July 2011 and January 2012 he booked an . unspecified number of flights and hotel rooms on the company’s account . using company passwords. He also admitted accessing the accounts of Cambridge Business Travel and booking numerous flights in January last year. The court was told that Thomson Travel had been conned out of £11,256, while Cambridge Travel was duped out of £59,878. Scobie made some of the bookings from the public computer in Perth’s AK Bell Library. He was arrested early in 2013 and had his passport taken by Perth Sheriff Court as a bail condition. However, he returned to court on April 18 and falsely said he had a new job in the travel industry and would need his passport.

One of few whaling villages: Lamalera village on the southern tip of Lembata, Indonesia . A major search by tribes people and marine police has failed to find any trace of the men, their boat or the whale, the Jakarta Globe reported today. Traditional whale hunters on Lembata usually hunt sperm whales, known locally as koteklema, but because they have become scare in recent years the villagers have turned their attention to orcas. ‘We’ve searched everywhere for the men,’ said Yoseph Daison, chief of the village of Lamalera.

The incident has provoked varying views on social media, one writer comparing it to the fictional story of Captain Ahab who hunted the white whale, Moby Dick, in revenge for the boats it had sunk. But another writer emphasised that the hunters search for whales to provide just enough meat for their whole village and was a process filled with religious rites and taboos.","Four of 12 hunters swam to shore, but their companions went down .

David Cameron and Nick Clegg held ‘tense’ face-to-face talks yesterday as the Liberal Democrats prompted further Tory anger with a bizarre claim that they knew nothing about a key plank of Government education policy. The Prime Minister and his Lib Dem deputy had a private lunch meeting at which Mr Cameron expressed serious concern about a Lib Dem attack on free schools over the weekend. The Deputy Prime Minister is understood to have stood his ground, insisting his U-turn was about wanting ‘better standards for parents’. Cameron and Clegg are said to have held 'tense' talks yesterday over the Lib Dem's U-turn over free schools . Mr Clegg is expected to use a speech later this week to confirm he will no longer support some of the fundamental principles of free schools, which have been set up by businesses, charities, religious organisations and groups of parents free from council control. The Deputy Prime Minister says he no longer supports some of the most important freedoms exercised by free school heads, including their power to set their own curriculum and hire teachers without union-recognised qualifications. Business Secretary Vince Cable fuelled the row last night by claiming the Lib Dems had not voted in favour of allowing free schools – like private schools – to hire whoever they like. ‘I think we want to make sure, as Liberal Democrats, that the free schools are properly supported by trained teachers and that's where we've parted company to some extent with the Secretary of State [Michael Gove],’ Mr Cable told ITV News. ‘The original idea which we voted for at the beginning of this Parliament, the assumption was that there would be properly qualified teachers and that seems to have changed.’ The remarks drew a scathing response . from senior Tories, who pointed out that Lib Dem peers had voted with . the Government in the House of Lords to kill off a Labour attempt to . prevent free schools having an open hiring policy. 'It's . typical of Vince Cable and Nick Clegg that they now claim they never . knew about something that they actually voted for - no wonder people . hate MPs for lying all the time,’ said one Government source. 'Nick Clegg's rich parents sent him to a brilliant private school that doesn't rely only on government certified teachers but he now says he wants to deny that flexibility for state schools. ‘It's typical of Clegg's hypocrisy and dishonesty. He's happy for rich people to keep going to schools where the heads make hiring and firing decisions but he won't let everybody else do the same.’ Even some of Mr Clegg’s allies expressed private unease about the party’s confusing position. A Lib Dem source said Mr Clegg and Mr Cameron had had an ‘open and polite’ discussion in which the Deputy Prime Minister ‘made clear he supported free schools but wanted better standards for parents’. Another source said the Deputy Prime . Minister had ‘ranted’ at Mr Cameron about remarks from a Government . source attacking him for ‘cheap sanctimony’ in yesterday’s Daily Mail. Vince Cable fuelled the row by claiming his party had not voted to allow the schools to hire who they like . Asked about his comments on free schools on ITV's The Agenda programme last night, Mr Clegg said: 'I personally - maybe I didn't explain it well enough - don't find it complicated to say look, we're moving towards a world in our school system where there are more academies more free schools, where schools for the first time in a generation have much more freedom and autonomy to set their rules what they do every day and so on... 'We need to decide in years ahead what that means for things like standards. So what I'm saying is as a Liberal Democrat, I actually am in support of our push to give schools more freedom but in future I also want to make sure we give parents the reassurance that standards are met. I don't find that very complicated. Row: The coalition split centres on the free schools set up by Tory Education Secretary Michael Gove . 'You have to move with the times - we're moving towards a different way of running our schools. Give them more freedom but give parents the reassurance that they're going to be taught by qualified teachers.' A Tory source said: 'We're surprised the contents of a private meeting have been briefed to the press. The Liberals seem a bit rattled by the confusion over their free schools policy.' Labour’s shadow education minister Kevin Brennan said: ‘Nick Clegg is locked into this failure too. He ordered his party through the lobbies in favour of unqualified teachers and his schools minister, David Laws, said he was 100 per cent behind the policy in Parliament last week. This is just more proof that you can't trust a word the Lib Dems say.’ Graham Stuart, chairman of the education select committee, accused the Deputy Prime Minister of making a ‘strangely illiberal policy announcement’ and compared him to the late left-wing Labour Cabinet minister Barbara Castle. ‘My understanding is the a typical liberal view would be believing that you trust the front line to decide who should teach but you hold them strongly to account through exam results and through Ofsted,’ Mr Stuart said. ‘I thought they believed in localism and yet here we are, at the first sign of trouble and Nick Clegg comes over all Barbara Castle. It’s a very peculiar approach and it’s already leading to splits in the Lib Dems.’ Mr Stuart said that Mr Clegg’s comments left David Laws, the Lib Dem education minister who backed free schools, including ‘superb’ teachers without formal qualifications, in the Commons last week in a ‘difficult position’. Baroness Buscombe, a Conservative peer, said the Deputy Prime Minister was being ‘two-faced’ and hypocritical since he was almost certainly taught by ‘brilliant’ unqualified teachers as a child at the expensive private Westminster School. Education minister Liz Truss said there would be no change to Government policy, despite Mr Clegg’s objections. ‘I think it is important that they have freedom over teaching and over the curriculum. I think that is what is making them successful,’ she said. ‘I am slightly surprised to hear what Nick Clegg has to say, because on Thursday David Laws made an impassioned speech in favour of free schools having these freedoms. ‘So there seems to be a bit of confusion about their policy but we are very clear that the government policy is that free schools should have that freedom. ‘The proposals went through on free schools with Liberal Democrat support.’","Clegg said on Sunday he no longer supported some of the freedoms held by free school heads .

Bob Tur, the famous news helicopter pilot who filmed a mob beating driver Reginald Denny during the LA Riots, and the O.J. Simpson car chase, has started treatment to become a woman. The 53-year-old from Santa Monica, who has two children, says that once the process is complete in November 'Bob must die' to make way for Zoey. Tur chose to publicly announce the transformation because she was 'done hiding', adding that in the past five years she had started to push family and friends away and had suffered from body dysmorphic disorder. Changes: Helicopter pilot Bob Tur has captured news events from the LA riots to OJ Simpson's car chase . Family and friends have been supportive of the Tur's decision, although she added that for some it felt like grieving as they prepared to say goodbye to Bob. 'For the most part, people didn’t know. They were in a state of shock initially,' she told CBS Los Angeles. 'My kids were in a state of shock. And they have been going through this mourning process. Bob Tur has got to die. And that’s going to happen within the next three or four months.' Going through the transitional period . 'has not been easy' Tur said, adding she had been worried how it would . affect her children including daughter, Katy, who is a reporter on NBC Nightly News. Tur, who married at age 23 and has dated Carrie Fisher, is currently in the early stages of aggressive hormone replacement therapy, which changes body hair and starts the growth of breasts. She says her body is catching up with her mind, which has been female since birth. Impact: Bob Tur is concerned about how his transformation will affect his children, including reporter Katy, right . 'There have been incredible changes that happen physically and mentally. Mental changes have already happened, Tur said. 'I’m thinking the same way a woman would think.' The pilot, who has more than 10,000 flying hours over war zones and riots, says the hormone therapy has affected the way she flies, adding that her thought pattern has become more analytical than instinctive. Tur, who says many transgender people pick hyper masculine jobs such as pilots or servicemen,  will have surgery to make her face more feminine and to have sexual reassignment surgery. In an interview with TMZ she said:'Transgender people really are misunderstood. It's not what you think'. The pilot says she has had a female brain since birth, but struggled to come to terms with who she is. Dramatic: Bob Tur helped capture images of truck driver Reginald Denny being beaten during the LA riots . Action: The pilot was also there to get footage of OJ Simpson's car chase in June 1994 . 'Initially you really don't know what to make of it. It just got very depressing because you don't recognize your image in the mirror.' Tur is charting the transformation at facebook.com/robert.tur to raise awareness and acceptance. 'It’s a genetic disorder that happens in utero. Nobody knows exactly why, but you’re born with a female or feminized brain,' she said. 'If you don’t really know who you are. You think you’re a woman, but you’re a man.' Transformation: When the course of hormone therapy ends later this year, Bob Tur will be known as Zoey . She decided to start treatment after starting to withdraw from the world over the past five years and suffering from depression. But since starting her transformation into Zoey, Tur says her life has improved massively. 'Now that my brain is getting the right hormones… I had no idea that life was like this ... For the first time, I’m truly happy,' she said.","Father-of-two started hormone therapy after years of depression .

Repeal: Nick Clegg has said that TV licences and winter fuel payments are going to well-off elderly people who 'do not need it' Nick Clegg has signalled that the Liberal Democrats would repeal free television licences and winter fuel payments for the better-off elderly. In a flip-flop from his position last week, the Deputy Prime Minister said those who could afford to give up the perks should in order to save money for future generations. Those ideas would form part of the Lib Dems’ manifesto at the general election, he said. ‘Some of these universal benefits – TV licence, winter fuel payments and so on – are going to people who simply don’t need them,’ he told ITV’s The Agenda programme. ‘It’s not because of their age... but because they have the wealth to be able to cover those costs themselves. ‘I certainly will be advocating that – I hope other parties will as well.’ He added: ‘Alan Sugar having his TV licence [paid for] is a nonsense.’ His remarks are in stark contrast to those he  made last week following suggestions that the Government should treat wealthier pensioners less generously. Social mobility tsar Alan Milburn said on Thursday that ministers should ‘look again’ at universal benefits for pensioners. He said the elderly were not carrying their fair share of the burden of austerity measures. The former Labour health secretary also hit out at the rises to state pensions at a time of a growing older population. But Mr Clegg dismissed Mr Milburn’s idea last week, saying ‘punishing the elderly’ would not help younger generations.

Having solved one of the greatest mysteries of British history, scientists desperate to unearth the next one and confirm if Richard III did murder the princes in the tower have been left disappointed. Previously secret documents show that the Church of England, backed by the Queen, has for 20 years refused repeated requests by experts to test skeletons believed to be the Tudor successors buried in Westminster Abbey. And it appears they will not be changing their minds after the University of Leicester announced to the world . this week that the skeleton found under a council car park in Leicester is that . of Richard III. The hunchback king: The skeleton unearthed in a Leicester dig last September was confirmed this week as Richard III but the mystery of the two princes will not be solved this way . Crime: The princes Edward and Richard in the Tower in a 1878 painting (left) but clerics will not allow their remains held in an urn to be probed by the same scientists who found the treacherous king Richard (right) Dastardly: On the seizure of the throne by their uncle Richard III, the young Edward V along with his brother the Duke of York were supposedly smothered in their sleep on the new king's orders . Those in charge of Wesminster Abbey will not allow the same forensic tests used to identify the former king to be tried on remains there. Their argument is that it could set a precedent for testing any number of historical theories linked to the many famous people buried at the church. Clerics are also concerned what they will do with the bones if they are found not to belong to who they thought they did. Blocked: The bosses of Westminster Abbey will not let scientists in and have had the backing of the Queen and the Government to do so . Richard, depicted by William . Shakespeare as a monstrous tyrant who murdered two princes in the Tower . of London, died at the Battle of Bosworth Field, defeated by an army led . by Henry Tudor. The king's . nephews Edward and Richard were kept in the Tower of London, according . to history recorded at the time, and 'stifled with pillows by the order of . their . perfidious uncle Richard the Usurper', according to the inscription on . the urn their remains are kept in. Leicester University's Turi King said this week they could take DNA from the princes and match it with Richard III to find if they were related. But a Westminster Abbey spokeswoman told the Guardian: 'The recent discovery of . Richard III does not change the abbey's position, which is that the . mortal remains of two young children, widely believed since the 17th . century to be the princes in tower, should not be disturbed.' The Richard III Society, who were behind this week's confirmation of the monarch's identity, tried twice to get the urn opened in 1993 with the BBC and in 1995 with Channel 4. But the Dean of Westminster the Very Rev Michael Mayne refused to allow carbon dating and DNA testing to get to the bottom of the mystery. In 1993 he took advice from academics and experts who said the techniques would only age the bones to within 50 years, and as Richard III only reigned from 1483 to 1485 it would not be accurate enough. 'It could not therefore differentiate between Richard III or Henry VII – . or another – being the guilty party. Nor would the C/14 technique give . any clue as to the age at death of the children,' the Dean said. The Palace and Home Secretary at the time, Michael Howard, were all consulted and were in 'full agreement'. The face of a king: There were cheers from media . who had gathered from around the world as the announcement was made at . the University of Leicester this week . The fatal blows? This image of the skull shows where Richard III was injured . Theory: Dr Turi King discusses the DNA evidence and is the first to confirm the remains are those of Richard III and says this information will confirm if the bones in the Abbey are linked to him by blood . In 1995, dealing with the Channel 4 request, the Dean then admitted science had moved along further but could cause even more problems if he agreed to testing. 'A sample of bone (skin/hair/tissue) from a known individual related to . the princes would be required, and that almost certainly means opening a . second tomb in the Abbey or elsewhere. If the result is positive, the . remains of the two princes are placed back in Sir Christopher Wren's . urn. But what if they are negative: what do we do with the remains?' he said. 'Keep them in the urn in the royal chapels, knowing they are bogus, or . re-bury them elsewhere? And what would we have gained, other than to . satisfy our curiosity in one area. It would not bring us any nearer the . truth of the affair. 'There are others buried in the abbey whose identity is somewhat . uncertain, including Richard II, and allowing these bones to be examined . could well set a precedent for other requests. I do not believe we are . in the business of satisfying curiosity, or of certifying that remains . in the abbey tombs are what they are said to be.'","Princes Edward and Richard were killed by the king's men in 1483 .

Yet Signhild's prodigious skills are actually the result of the lengths her father went to to make his little girl smile. Swedish photographer Emil Nystrom and his partner Isabelle, both 25, wanted a family album with a difference. With a little help from Photoshop, their daughter looks capable beyond her years. Signhild Nystrom was only five months old when this was taken, looking as though she was tackling her parents' decorating with ease. Thanks to Photoshop, her mother Isabelle was taken out of the picture so it looked like Signhild was standing up by herself .

Mr Nystrom said: 'It's just so much fun. There is nothing serious about these pictures and that shows when we take them. 'The only thing that usually is in my mind when I take them is to get as funny face as possible from the baby.

The number of sickening child abuse images found on the internet has doubled in a year, a report has found. As Britain's internet giants face growing demands to do more to block indecent images, experts said 70,000 pictures and videos of children being abused were discovered last year - double the 2011 figure of 35,000. The annual study by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection (CEOP) Centre also highlighted a growing problem: vulnerable families in developing countries streaming live abuse of their children via webcam in exchange for cash from paedophiles. Going online: As Britain's internet giants face growing demands to do more to block indecent images, experts said 70,000 pictures and videos of children being abused were discovered last year (file picture) It also found that there has been a 70 per cent increase in the number of images featuring girls under the age of 10, and a 125 per cent increase in the number of Level 4 images - which feature sex with children - on the internet. In its annual threat assessment of child sexual exploitation and abuse, CEOP said the rape and sexual assault of children being shown live over the internet was an emerging problem, and said that paedophiles were increasingly using sophisticated software to hide their illegal activities. Many are said to use heavily encrypted networks and other security measures to hide their abuse pictures within the 'hidden internet'. Peter Davies, chief executive of CEOP, said: ‘Our assessment shows that, sadly, there are still too many children at risk and too many people who would cause them serious harm. ‘While the assessment may not make comfortable reading, that isn’t its purpose. It’s an objective assessment of the issues as we see them but as a result it is also, undoubtedly, a call to action. ‘We should all practise zero tolerance to child sexual exploitation and abuse.’ The ease with which paedophiles can find sickening images has come under scrutiny in recent months following the convictions of Mark Bridger and Stuart Hazell for the murders of five-year-old April Jones and 12-year-old Tia Sharp. Both men had visited child abuse sites before the attacks. The parents of both children have called for more action to tackle the problem. In the spotlight: The ease at which paedophiles can find sickening images has come under scrutiny in recent months following the convictions of Mark Bridger (left) and Stuart Hazell (right) for the murders of young girls . CEOP warned that one in 58 children in the UK will be abused by someone who is not a relative before they turn 18.  And it says an estimated 50,000 web users are involved in distributing the sickening images in Britain. There are 10,000 fresh cases of children being abuse being reported in Britain each year, it found. Justice minister Damian Green said: . ‘These figures are deeply troubling and show how our understanding of . child sexual exploitation has greatly improved in recent years. 'More needs to be done. Together, as communities, we need to ensure these sickening crimes no longer remain hidden' Justice minister Damian Green . ‘Police are bringing more cases before the courts and significant sentences are being handed down to perpetrators. But more needs to be done. 'Together, as communities, we need to ensure these sickening crimes no longer remain hidden.’ An NSPCC spokesman added: ‘The evidence the NSPCC has gathered from all police forces in England and Wales shows there are around 20,000 sexual offences against children reported every year and many of the victims are under primary-school age. ‘However, we believe this is far from the true situation as many cases are never revealed. And since the (Jimmy) Savile sex crimes were revealed, our helpline has experienced an increase in the number of adults reporting cases which happened many years, even decades, earlier. ‘While there are cases of children being sexually assaulted by strangers, the vast majority of these offences - around nine out of 10 - are committed by someone the child knows.’","CEOP study finds 70% rise in number of images with girls under 10 .

But the other is queen of the skies – and in a staring competition, she’d clearly win talons down. Prince Charles came nose to beak with a very imperious bald eagle at the Sandringham Flower Show yesterday. The bird of prey has a wingspan of seven and a half feet and weighs 10lbs 4oz – two pounds more than baby Prince George. Pleased to meet you: The Prince of Wales holds an eagle called Zephyr during a visit to the 132nd Sandringham Flower Show . Go on, make me a mascot: The eagle needs royal approval to become the official mascot of the Army Air Corps . Nose to beak: The prince gets up close to the 10lb bird . Charles gamely agreed to wear a leather . glove and handle the ‘good-natured’ Zephyr – but couldn’t help springing . back in shock when she flapped her wings. Her handler Lisa Falco, from . the Imperial Bird of Prey Academy in Essex, insisted she had simply been . attempting to balance herself. ‘She is a wonderfully good-natured bird, very, very gentle. That’s why . we called  her Zephyr, which means gentle breeze,’ she said. Gentle breeze or no, Camilla had no intention of following her husband’s . lead and taking a turn with the bird. ‘That’s a very sharp beak,’ she . said, ‘I think not!’ Lisa Falco, from the Imperial Bird of Prey Academy in Billericay, Essex, said they hoped the encounter would further their cause to make Zephyr the official mascot of the Army Air Corps. She said: 'We are awaiting royal approval so hopefully this meeting will help with that.' Royal perch: Zephyr lands on the prince's arm . High flier: Charles was nearly clipped by the bird's impressive wing span . About 20,000 people attended the annual show and many braved heavy rain to offer their congratulations to the new grandparents. Ann Whiting, of Castle Rising, Norfolk presented the couple with a crocheted shawl which she had spent six months making. Prince Charles was heard saying the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would be 'thrilled' with the gift. Brolly good: The couple braved the wet weather to attend the Norfolk event .

Brightening up their day: Well-wishers were happy to wait in the rain for a chance to meet the royals at Sandringham House . Meet and greet: Camilla shakes hands with the waiting public . Joker: The prince seemed in high spirits as he laughed and pointed at the cameras . The Sandringham Women's Institute member said: 'I started soon after the announcement that she was pregnant was made. I wanted to give them something special but which they could also use. He seemed pleased with it and said he would pass it on.' Sheila Clarke, 55, travelled from . Glasgow to hand over a teddy bear wearing a bib which she had . embroidered with the name George. The prince asked her: 'Did you place a bet on the sex and name?' Granddad's: Charles said he would pass on toys to the Prince of Cambridge, but seems rather taken with this teddy himself . Gift for a prince: Another well-wisher passed on a personalised bear for the new royal baby . Congratulations: The Prince of Wales said his grandson was doing well . Pretty in pink: The prince stops to admire a baby girl as he chatted to the crowd . For you: Meanwhile the Duchess is presented with some seeds by 22-month-old Evelyn Holt . Puppy love: He also paused to stroke a dog . Say cheese! The dog loving duchess posed for a picture with Jack Russell, Scooby . Afterwards, she said: 'I told him a bought the bib a little while ago but waited until the birth to embroider the name on it. He seemed very happy with the present.' Meanwhile, Evelyn Holt, 22 months old, presented . Charles with some blue crocus bulbs as he told members of the public . that his new grandson, George, was 'doing very well'. Her mother, Victoria Holt, from Wymondham, Norfolk, said: 'He seemed very interested in Evelyn and gave her lots of attention.' Having fun: The couple share a joke at the flower show .

Dame Maggie Smith was among the royal couple's guests at the show, along with Dame Judi Dench and television food critic Matthew Fort who also attended a charity concert in the village of Salle last night. The Duchess was heard commenting on the weather, remarking how the event normally enjoyed bright sunshine, while she posed for a picture with Jack Russell, Scooby. Scooby's owner, Yvonne Harradine, 66, . from Terrington St Clement, Norfolk, said: 'She likes Jack Russells and I . took a picture of her with Scooby last year but when it came out I . realised I had cut her head off. It was very kind of her to agree to pose for another picture and I think it worked this time.'The Sandringham Flower Show takes place every year in Sandringham Park against the backdrop of Sandringham House. The couple, who arrived and left by horse and cart, viewed competition entries including vegetables, fruit, flowers and floral art. Showers: Smiling Camilla didn't let the rain dampen her day . There is nothing like a Dame: Dame Maggie Smith, left, and Dame Judi Dench also attended the show in Norfolk . The profits from each show are donated to local charities and since 1977 the show committee has given more than £500,000 to good causes. The prince took particular interest in a garden to honour the Prince's Trust. It showed an area of wilderness linked by bridge to a more ordered garden to symbolise the part the trust plays in turning young people's lives around.","Prince of Wales held 10lbs eagle called Zephyr .

A woman whose giant legs kept her a prisoner in her bed for five years is now able to walk again after finally seeking help. Sophia Loots, suffered from lymphedema which caused her legs to swell to 10 stone each. But she was too ashamed of her weight to go to the hospital for a diagnosis - thinking it had been caused by overeating. The 42-year-old, from Cape Town, South Africa, saw her weight balloon from 14st to almost 50st after being bitten by a mosquito in 2006. It is likely that the insect was carrying filarial larvae, which blocked the fluid draining passages within her lymphatic system causing her legs to swell. Lymphedema is most often caused by parasitic worms blocking fluid draining passages within the lymphatic system. This causes huge swelling especially in the legs . Elephantiasis sufferer Sophia Loots (left), poses with friend Margie Grey, and one of her old skirts from before her operation . The foster mother of two children grew so heavy she was unable to perform simple tasks such as washing or going to the toilet unaided. Sophia became depressed and turned to food for comfort, which caused her weight to increase even further. She developed elephantiasis due to the severe lymphedema, when her skin thickened and swelled further. But following a public appeal to save her life Sophia was put on a radical diet plan and lost 3st 9lbs in 25 days. This was enough weight to make her eligible for surgery. She was transported to Johannesburg on a mattress in the back of a van for the treatment. Under the leadership of Dr Dirk le Roux the excess fluid was drained from her legs before the sagging skin was removed. Mrs Loots said: 'I honestly thought I was going to die in my bed. It was terrible - my kids had to come home from school to help me go to the toilet. 'My husband worked away a lot and I spent my time alone in bed knitting or listening to the radio or in tears.' Celebration: Mrs Loots' 42nd birthday cake made to celebrate the successful operation to drain her legs . Mrs Loots says she can enjoy being a mother to her adopted daughters Marita, 17, and Nolene (right), 14, again. Her husband Manie, 66, worked away a lot and she spent much of her time at home crying . At one point Sophia's eating got so out of control she would eat a loaf and a half of bread with a block of cheese and three family bags of crisps every day. She also swilled down 10 cups of coffee with five sugars and cream, two litres of cola . She said: 'Food was my only comfort in the end. In the space of five years I lost everything, I could barely call myself a mum. 'My legs felt like they were on fire all the time. I was in agony - it was torture.' Sophia and her husband Manie, 66, fostered Marita, 17, and Nolene, 13, ten years ago, but the girls ended up caring for Sophia. At one point it took five people to lift Sophia's legs to be able to wash her. But after having surgery to drain her legs and remove the excess skin, Sophia is now down to 20 stone. Mrs Loots underwent manual lymph drainage in Johannesburg followed by surgery to remove excess skin . Mrs Loots has lymphostatic elephantiasis, a condition that has made her legs swell to almost triple their normal size (see right). Symptoms of the disease may include severe fatigue, a heavy swollen limb or fluid accumulation in other body areas, discoloration of the skin overlying the lymphedema, and eventually deformity. Lymphostatic elephantiasis is an extreme form of lymphoedema - a swelling in a limb as a result of damage to the lymphatic system, the body’s waste disposal system. The lymphatic system plays an important role in the immune system, removing bacteria and waste from the tissues through a fine network of vessels carrying a fluid known as lymph. This travels to the lymph nodes, where it is cleansed. If the system is compromised - as can happen as a result of both cancer surgery (where the nodes are removed) or radiotherapy (which can create scar tissue that blocks the lymphatic channels) -  unfiltered lymph fluid becomes trapped and forms pools, causing swelling. Up to 250,000 people in the UK suffer from lymphoedema and key triggers for the devastating and often disfiguring condition are surgery and radiotherapy where lymph nodes are removed or damaged, particularly in breast, prostate and gynaecological cancers. However, it is thought that Mrs Loots developed condition from a mosquito bite. There is another form of lymphoedema called Filariasis, which affects as many as 200 million people worldwide (primarily in the areas such as Africa, where she lives, and southeast Asia). When the larvae from a mosquito bite enters the lymphatic system, they mature into adult worms in the lymphatic channels, causing severe lymphedema in the arms, legs and genitalia - also known as Elephantiasis. She said: 'What I've been through is nothing short of a miracle. 'I was introduced to a dietician called Christo Strydam who created a diet especially for people like me. In the first month on my diet I lost a stone and a half. 'Taking my first steps in five years was very emotional.' Sophia says doctors eventually diagnosed her with lymphedema, which can be brought on by mosquito bites. Sophia was also suffering from emotional distress at the time after losing her father and having a stillborn child and this could have contributed to the collapse of her lymphatic system.","Sophia Loots, 42, saw her weight balloon from 14st to almost 50st .

A fifth of Android users are ditching their devices in favour of Apple's iPhone according to a U.S report. The Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIPR) survey also found that people . with Apple devices are younger, richer and have more masters degrees or . doctorates compared to people who own Samsung phones. Figures also show that Apple took 33 per cent more customers away from Samsung during the period of June 2012 to June 2013 than Samsung took from Apple. A fifth of people are ditching their Samsung devices, such as the Galaxy S3 right, for an Apple iPhone, left, according to a report by the Consumer Intelligence Research Partners group in the U.S. The report also found that Apple owners are younger, more educated and earn more money than other smartphone users . Around 20 per cent of new Apple customers previously owned an Android device, while only 7 per cent of Samsung buyers previously owned an iPhone. Samsung was more popular with people who had never bought a smartphone before with 37 per cent of people upgrading their basic phones to Samsung models . iPhone owners are vainer and spend more on clothes and grooming than those who have BlackBerrys and Android phones, according to research from TalkTalk Mobile. BlackBerry owners earn the most and are more likely to have long-term relationships, while people with Android handsets have the best manners and are handy in the kitchen. The study surveyed 2,000 owners of the three major smartphone brands to determine whether the choice of handset was an extension of their personality. The results come from quarterly CIPR surveys that asked 500 people who had bought a phone in the previous 90 days. They asked the participants about their age, income, education, previous handset and new device. Figures revealed that 20 per cent of new Apple iPhone customers had previously owned an Android device, while only 7 per cent of Samsung buyers have previously owned an iPhone. However, Samsung was more popular with people who had never bought a smartphone before with 37 per cent of people upgrading their basic phones to Samsung models, compared to 26 per cent who chose Apple. The majority of Apple iPhone owners, 69 per cent, were under 34, while more than a third of iPhone customers had masters degrees and earned between £75,000 and £150,000 a year. The report also found that people who previously owned a BlackBerry were more inclined to switch to an Apple device, whereas HTC and Nokia owners preferred to upgrade to Samsung. In July Samsung overtook Apple in terms of marketshare and shipped double the amount of handsets. Apple’s share of the smartphone market dropped to 14 per cent, its lowest for three years, because of ‘lacklustre’ iPhone 5 sales and tougher competition from rivals, according to industry analysts. The majority of Apple iPhone owners, 69 per cent, were aged between 18 and 34. More than a third of iPhone customers had masters degrees and earned between £75,000 and £150,000 a year . Driven by demand for cheaper Android devices in Asia and Latin America, Samsung’s handset  division made an estimated £3.4billion operating profit in the second quarter of this year. The company was also said to have made 27.7 per cent of all phones sold during the second quarter of this year. In the same month, Samsung beat Apple to take the top spot in a customer satisfaction survey in the U.S, too. Two of its handsets - the Galaxy S III and the Galaxy Note II - tied in first and second place in the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ASCI) ahead of Apple's iPhone 5, iPhone 4S and iPhone 4. The CIPR survey also found that people with Apple devices have more masters degrees or doctorates compared to people who own Samsung phones . The survey scored phones, and ultimately brands, on anticipation of quality compared to the product's actual quality, reliability, as well as price and perceived value. Samsung's Galaxy S III and Galaxy Note II both scored 84 out of a possible 100. Apple's iPhone 5 and 4S tied in third and fourth with 82 points, while the iPhone 4 scored 81. Motorola Mobility's Droid Razr Maxx HD handset gave the Google-owned company sixth place with a score of 80 and its Droid Razr was in eighth with 77. Samsung's Galaxy SII scored 78, in seventh place. BlackBerry took ninth and tenth place with the BlackBerry Curve scoring 67 and the BlackBerry Bold on 64.","Apple took three times as many customers from Samsung than Samsung took from Apple in the past year .

Archaeologists believe the the discovery of 30 human skeletons thought to be up to 2,000 years old, could provide a link with the first settlers of the Americas. The bones were found in 'La Sepultura' cave in Tamaulipas state, Mexico and are being studied by genetics experts to see if the humans were related to the early groups who wandered the continent. Radiocarbon tests and studies of ancient DNA, recovered from the site near Tula, in the Sierra Madre Oriental, will tell if it was also home to one of the oldest genetic lineages of America, associated with the people who crossed the Bering Strait, around 10,000 years ago. Skeletons found in 'La Sepultura' cave in Tamaulipas state, Mexico. About 30 human skeletons found in the cave which can date from the second millennium before our era could be linked with the first settlers of the American continent, according to a genetic study carried out by experts from INAH . Scientists from the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) in Mexico and the University of Cordoba, Spain are examining the remains. The proposed further exploration and excavation of burial caves in Tamaulipas seeks to 'better understand the origin, development, quality and lifestyle of ancient cultures who settled in the region,' said physical anthropologist Jesús Ernesto González Velasco of INAH. He said that studying the DNA and radiocarbon as well as the skulls' morphology, scientists 'will allow a deeper understanding of the extent and cultural practices of hunter-gatherers'. Radiocarbon tests and studies of ancient DNA, recovered from the skeletons (pictured) at the site near Tula, in the Sierra Madre Oriental, will tell if it was also home to one of the oldest gentic lineages of America . Research into the site began in 2009 and DNA results show the skeletons could be old with lineages that predate Christ by around ten thousand years. Scientists have dated skeletal remains found at the same site back to between 1387 and 914 BC. Previous studies found mummified samples in nearby 'La Escondida' cave that archaeologists said showed DNA traces of groups of humans that settled early in the Americas. Scientists hope that the discovery will shed more light on the origin of Mexican prehistoric groups and their dispersion over time.

Samsung has announced that its Galaxy Mega phone – the biggest smartphone on the global market - will finally be available to consumers in the U.S. from Friday although there have been no announcements made about when it will come to the UK or other regions. With a screen measuring a giant 6.3 inches diagonally, the Mega looks more like a tablet than a phone. Samsung have described it as a hybrid that combines the portability of a smartphone with the immersive experience that a tablet offers for movies, books, music and games. The Galaxy Mega, the biggest smartphone on the global market, finally hits the U.S. on Friday (this image of phone has been sized to look life-sized on a typical desktop monitor) They are confident that the big design will appeal to commuters and others who regularly watch films on their gadgets. 'The newest addition to the Galaxy family balances an optimal viewing experience on a 6.3-inch HD screen, yet is ultra-thin and portable enough to put into a pocket or hold in one hand,' the firm said. 'The GALAXY Mega offers a mix of popular smartphone and tablet features such as an effortless user experience, a split screen, multitasking between video and other apps and more.' It claims video and web browsing will be the main uses for the Mega. A phone too far? The Samsung Galaxy Note smartphone was the first 'phablet' but now an even bigger version has been launched . Analysts have deemed a 'phablet' to be a mobile gadget with a screen more than 5 inches diagonally. The word comes from blending phone and tablet. Samsung's Galaxy Note was the first popular 'phablet'. Shipments of gadgets that are 5 inches or bigger in screen size are predicted to surge nearly nine-fold to 228 million during the next three years. Estimates vary because no one can agree on where smartphones stop and phablets start. AT&T says it will start selling the Mega on Friday for $150 with a two-year service contract. The Mega is also coming to Sprint and U.S. Cellular. Dates and prices weren't announced for those carriers. The U.S. is playing catchup with the Mega as the phone has already been available in Europe, Russia, and Samsung's home base of South Korea since May. 'We are aware of a great potential in the bigger screen for extensive viewing multimedia, web browsing, and more,' said JK Shin of Samsung. 'We are excited to provide another choice to meet our consumers’ varying lifestyles, all while maintaining the high-quality features of the award-winning GALAXY series.' However, some critics are less impressed and say the new size is too big to be considered a cellphone. Samsung is known for big phones. Its flagship Galaxy S4 is 5 inches, while the Galaxy Note 2 is 5.5 inches. Apple's iPhone 5 is 4 inches. Samsung has helped to popularize the so-called 'phablet' category - in which phones approach tablet dimensions - with its original 5.3in Galaxy Note, which was released in 2011. Analysts have deemed a 'phablet' is a mobile gadget with a screen more than 5inches diagonally. The word comes from blending phone and tablet. The rise of the giant phone: Samsung's Galaxy Mega 6.3 is now the biggest phone on the market, dwarfing the iPhone . Samsung is also known for offering a variety of devices, with different screen sizes and prices, to target a range of consumers. Because of that, it's now the leading maker of phones. Apple, by contrast, has been releasing one model a year that targets high-end consumers. A new iPhone is expected this fall. The Mega includes many features available in other recent Galaxy phones. That includes Multi Window, which allows multitasking in a split screen, and Easy Mode, which reduces the number of features and choices for new smartphone users. Mega buyers can choose either nova black or polaris white as the color. As Samsung's phones get larger, at least one of HTC Corp.'s is getting smaller. AT&T announced Monday that it will start selling a smaller version of the HTC One. Called the HTC One Mini, it will have a 4.3-inch screen, compared with 4.7 inches on the standard model. It's also lighter, at 4.3 ounces. The One is 5 ounces. The One Mini will be about $100 cheaper than its big brother. It will be available starting Friday for $100 with a two-year service agreement.

A News International source insisted she would be treated as a witness, not a suspect. However, both the company and Scotland Yard refused to comment on whether Brooks would be quizzed. Meanwhile, Labour leader Ed Miliband . used a television interview this morning to ratchet up the political . pressure on the Government over the scandal. Team: NotW editor Colin Myler brandished the final ever edition of the paper in front of his staff before announcing: 'And now in the best traditions of Fleet Street, we are going to the pub' Causing a stir: News of The World staff members Francine Packer (left), Hannah Eades and Jane Hamilton (right) carry cups of tea to waiting reporters outside the News International offices . He told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: 'I think it beggars belief that Rebekah Brooks is still in her post - Rebekah Brooks was the editor at the time that Milly Dowler's phone was hacked. 'The idea she's still in her post, I don't think the public can understand how that can possibly be the case.' The Opposition yesterday called for the immediate appointment of a judge to head the public inquiry into the News of the World announced by the Prime Minister on Friday. And Mr Miliband is reported to be preparing to force a Commons vote this week on whether consideration of News Corp's proposed takeover of satellite broadcaster BSkyB should be halted. Still further financial pressure looked set to be heaped on the media group as it was reported that Labour will table a motion next week opposing News Corporation's proposed takeover of satellite broadcaster BSkyB. Concerns: Labour Party leader Ed Miliband (left) and Energy Secretary Chris Huhne (right) both appeared on today's Andrew Marr Show to express their worries about the phone-hacking scandal . Energy Secretary Chris Huhne told the Andrew Marr Show that 'very serious risks' had been run by the Prime Minister in hiring Andy Coulson. He added that the Liberal Democrats would look at the detail of the Opposition motion before deciding which way to vote on News Corp's proposed takeover of satellite broadcaster BSkyB. The tabloid's farewell issue hit shelves as News Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch was expected to fly in to the UK to deal with the phone hacking crisis that forced the paper's closure. It comes as a senior Scotland Yard detective expressed his ‘extreme regret’ that he did not act to reopen police inquiries into the hacking allegations two years ago. Speaking after this week's revelation that the mobile phone of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler was targeted, Assistant Commissioner John Yates, who ruled in July 2009 that there was no new evidence, told the Sunday Telegraph: ‘We are all extremely shocked by it and it is a matter of massive regret we didn't deal with it earlier.’ At Downing Street, Prime Minister David Cameron is to meet Milly Dowler's family to discuss the Government's response to the phone hacking crisis. Milly's parents Bob and Sally Dowler are suing the News of the World over claims their daughter's phone was targeted when she went missing in 2002. As the paper was finally put to bed, . the criminal investigation into alleged illegal practices continued to . gather momentum with officers poised to make more arrests. In the past three days, three people have been quizzed by police. A . 63-year-old man arrested in Surrey on Friday in connection with alleged . corrupt payments made to police officers, has been bailed to return to a . London police station in October. Officers would not confirm reports . that he is a private investigator. Former . News of the World editor Andy Coulson was questioned for nine hours on . Friday over suspected corruption and the scandal which forced the . paper's closure. Ex-royal . editor Clive Goodman, 53, has also spoken to police over claims officers . were bribed following a dawn swoop on his Surrey home. Mr Cameron is also likely to face further scrutiny over his decision to retain Mr Coulson as his spin chief on coming to power. Former Liberal Democrat leader Paddy . Ashdown said he had warned Downing Street it would be a ‘disaster’ shortly after the general election. Mistake: Assistant Commissioner John Yates expressed his 'extreme regret' that he did not act to reopen police inquiries into phone hacking two years ago . He . told The Observer that he spoke out after being briefed on information . that could not be published for legal reasons at the time concerning the . ex-newspaper editor who resigned after his royal reporter was jailed . but denied any knowledge of hacking under his watch. ‘I . warned No 10 within days of the election that they would suffer . terrible damage if they did not get rid of Coulson, when these things . came out, as it was inevitable they would,’ he said. With . two independent public inquiries on the horizon, News Corporation was . also faced with the threat of losing £4million in investments from the . Church of England if the organisation fails to hold ‘senior managers’ to . account. It has already . strongly denied allegations published in The Guardian which claim . millions of emails from an internal archive at News International may . have been destroyed in what could be seen as a bid to obstruct Scotland . Yard's inquiry. They've got the look: Prime Minister David Cameron (left) and his former spin doctor Andy Coulson have a strangely similar dress sense . The News of the World bade farewell to its readers after 168 years with the simple words ‘Thank you & goodbye’. The 8,674th edition of the tabloid features the headline emblazoned over images of its most famous front pages. A sub-headline reads: ‘After 168 years, we finally say a sad but very proud farewell to our 7.5m loyal readers.’ And in the top right corner are the words: ‘The world's greatest newspaper 1843-2011.’ The closing issue features much celebration of the best scoops and greatest campaigns that have helped the newspaper make its mark over the years. But there is also an apology for the phone hacking scandal that eventually brought the tabloid to its knees. The statement, printed on page three, reads: ‘We praised high standards, we demanded high standards but, as we are now only too painfully aware, for a period of a few years up to 2006 some who worked for us, or in our name, fell shamefully short of those standards. ‘Quite simply, we lost our way. Phones were hacked, and for that this newspaper is truly sorry.’ Although it claims there is no justification for the ‘appalling wrongdoing’, it goes on to say: ‘Yet when this outrage has been atoned, we hope history will eventually judge us on all our years.’ Inside the paper is a 48-page souvenir pull-out featuring some of the tabloid's most memorable splashes, such as last year's expose of alleged match fixing involving Pakistan international cricketers. Farewell message: The News Of The World signed off with a simple front page message of, 'THANK YOU & GOODBYE' Front-page revelations of celebrities' affairs are featured alongside historic events, such as the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997, recorded in a ‘shock 8am issue’. Elsewhere in the paper, investigations editor Mazher Mahmood, famed for his undercover stings as the ‘fake sheikh’, pays tribute to the News of the World's achievements in helping bring criminals to justice. And campaigner Sara Payne praises the paper for being a ‘force for good’ and a driving force behind the call for Sarah's Law. Another page celebrates the ‘always tasteful Nudes of the World’, with images of the likes of Kelly Brook, Lily Allen and fuller-figured pop star Beth Ditto adorning the page. The newspaper, which has doubled its print run to five million today, is expected to record its biggest sale for years as its historic final edition becomes a collector's item.","Ed Miliband: It beggars belief that Rebekah Brooks is still in her post .

And if you can’t quite put a name to the face, the horse and carriage toy by the side of her pushchair offers a further clue. The two-year-old with the curly locks is our future Queen in an intimate portrait never before released for public viewing. Royal carriage: Queen Elizabeth II, when she was aged two, holds on tight to the rope of her toy horse in a photograph taken by her father, then Duke of York . The young Princess Elizabeth   was introduced to horseriding in the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace at the age of three, and was able to ride on her own by the time she was six. The photographs, from a delightful collection of previously unseen or rarely seen pictures, are testament to her early start as a horsewoman. The images will be published in a new Royal Collection book celebrating the arrival of the latest addition to her family, her great-grandson Prince George. Starting with Queen Victoria and ending with the new baby, the book features seven generations of kings and queens in the making. The photos are from the Royal archive and private collections of members of the Royal Family.

In her pram, on a rocking horse and learning how to ride, they reveal a touching portrait of her early childhood. In one photograph taken by her father in 1928 she sits on a rocking horse with her mother at her side. The same year the Duke captured his daughter in a wicker pram as she clasped the reins of a miniature horse and carriage.

The girlfriend of an NFL player shot dead in a botched home invasion wept on the stand today as she gave testimony on the first day of his murder trial. Jackie Garcia Haley told the court on Monday that Sean Taylor, her high school sweetheart and father of her daughter, lay gasping for air in a pool of blood after he was shot by intruders at their home in Palmetto Bay, Florida in 2007. Ms Haley, whose uncle is the actor Andy Garcia, shook as she said: 'I got a towel and tried to stop the bleeding. I ran outside and screamed for help. I told . them someone was dying, to please hurry.' She spoke at the trial of Eric Rivera, 23, the man accused of murdering Taylor during a bungled home invasion six years ago. Sean Taylor's girlfriend, Jackie Garcia Haley, reacts during testimony at the murder trial of Eric Rivera in Miami-Dade Circuit Court in Miami today . Redskins football player Sean Taylor, pictured in 2004, was murdered in 2007 during a violent home invasion in Florida . Taylor, who was 24 when he died, was a . Pro Bowl safety for the Redskins who had previously been a popular, . locally grown star at the University of Miami. The . court today were shown pictures of the promising football player . including one of him on draft day and another with his girlfriend and . young daughter on Easter Sunday. Prosecutors . say Rivera and four others, all from the Fort Myers area, thought . Taylor would be with the Redskins at a game at Tampa Bay the night they . broke into his house - but instead he was home with a knee injury. Taylor . was shot in the upper thigh, which severed his femoral artery. Taylor . had a machete in his hand, and his then-girlfriend Jackie Garcia and . their infant daughter were also in the bedroom, though they were not . hurt. Taylor died the next day from massive blood loss. Members . of Taylor's family, including his father, Florida City Police Chief . Pedro Taylor, took up nearly an entire row in the packed Miami-Dade . County courtroom. Ms Haley . said she did not see Taylor's assailant or any of the other would-be . burglars. But she did confirm that Taylor liked to keep large amounts of . cash in the house. Sean Taylor's father Pedro, left, and wife, Simone Taylor, center, appear in court for Eric Rivera's first-degree murder trial on Monday . Defendant Eric Rivera (left), listens to the testimony at his murder trial of Washington Redskins NFL football player Sean Taylor in Miami-Dade Circuit Court . Because Rivera was 17 at the time of the . crime, his maximum possible sentence if convicted is life in prison . rather than the death penalty. There have been a number of delays in the trials of those accused in Taylor's murder. The last trial date was postponed . when Rivera fired his  attorney, meaning his new lawyer required more . time to work on his case. Nearly . six years ago, a group of young men from southwest Florida drove across the state intending to burglarize Taylor's Miami-area home, thinking he wouldn't be home. When the 6'2, 230lb player, well known as a ferocious hitter, confronted them with a machete early on November 26, 2007, Rivera allegedly fired two shots. One missed. The other hit Taylor in the upper leg, causing massive and fatal blood loss. Four other people were charged in the case. One of them, Venjah Hunte, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and burglary charges and is expected to testify against Rivera. The other three are scheduled to go to trial later on lesser charges. Hunte's plea deal calls for a 29-year prison term instead of life. Although Taylor had some run-ins with the law and been fined several times by the NFL for various rules violations, his future seemed extremely bright before he was killed. Eric Rivera, pictured in 2007 after his arrest, faces charges of first degree murder . The son of Florida City Police Chief Pedro Taylor and an All-American player at the University of Miami, the Redskins drafted Taylor with the fifth overall pick in the 2004 draft and he signed an $18 million contract. Taylor quickly became a starter and was nicknamed 'Meast' by teammates, a combination of man and beast, because of his hard-hitting style. He was named to the Pro Bowl after the 2006 season and was also very popular among Redskins players and fans. One of his best friends, wide receiver Santana Moss, said he still says 'a little prayer' for Taylor every time he takes the field. 'I have a few people that have passed away in my life as friends that have meant something to me, and I'm always constantly speaking to them. That's just something I do. He's one of those guys,' Moss said. The Redskins contributed $500,000 to a fund for Taylor's young daughter after he died and, in the first game after his slaying, the team's defense took the field against Buffalo with only 10 players on the first play — leaving Taylor's free safety position vacant to honor him. Fans at that game got towels bearing his number, 21. To many fans, players and others connected with both the Redskins and the U' at Miami, it was heartbreaking to see such a talented player's life and career cut short so brutally. 'He was a young man who was learning quickly how to be a great human being, and, to me, he was the best football player I've ever seen in person,' said former Redskins tight end Chris Cooley, a nine-year veteran who now does broadcasts for the team. 'He was the most physical, the most gifted, the hardest-working guy that I've been around, and it was such an unfortunate thing.' Former Redskins coach Joe Gibbs, now a NASCAR racing team owner, said Taylor began to mature and take a leadership role on the team after the birth of his daughter. 'It wound up being a true tragedy and it had a huge effect on all of us,' Gibbs said of Taylor's killing. 'He was one of those guys that with the way he played and his persona the way he was, he was a natural leader. You could see guys look to him from a leadership standpoint.' The fatal attempted burglary was not the first time there was a break-in at Taylor's home. Police say someone pried open a window a few days earlier, on November 17, and rifled through a desk and other belongings. No one was home that time, and it's not clear exactly what, if anything, was taken. Free Safety Sean Taylor of the Washington Redskins seen playing against the New York Jets in November 2007 - just three weeks before he died . Then came the weekend after Thanksgiving with the Redskins playing the Buccaneers that Sunday. Taylor was given permission to stay home with a knee injury, along with his girlfriend, Jackie, and their 18-month-old daughter, also named Jackie. Police say two of the men charged had connections to Taylor: Jason Scott Mitchell had cut Taylor's lawn and an older cousin of suspect Charles Wardlow had dated Taylor's sister. Family members also said Mitchell had recently been at a birthday party at Taylor's house, where Taylor was known to keep large amounts of cash. Miami-Dade County's former police director, Robert Parker, said the defendants were surprised to find Taylor home early that Monday morning. 'They were certainly not looking to go there and kill anyone,' Parker said. 'They were expecting a residence that was not occupied.' Authorities say they have obtained confessions from at least some of the suspects, all from the Fort Myers area, but pretrial hearings on whether those statements will be allowed in Rivera's trial were closed by Circuit Judge Dennis Murphy. The judge also imposed a gag order on prosecutors and defense attorneys in hopes of limiting pretrial news media coverage that could make jury selection difficult. The murder weapon has never been found. Prosecutors say it was thrown into the Everglades after the slaying while the group drove home across Alligator Alley. 'Breaking into someone's home, into their personal safety blanket and shooting them in that environment is the most heinous, unthinkable crime that could have happened to a guy like Sean. It's despicable,' Cooley said.","Jackie Garcia Haley told the Miami court on Monday that she found Sean Taylor in a pool of blood at their home .

The mother of Murat Can Ertani has disowned him and admitted . she wished he were dead. Mirac Sengezer, 43, who works in advertising, said yesterday . that she felt ‘very bad’ about the situation and was ‘sorry’ that her son had run . away with Faye Jones. She told the Daily Mirror: ‘Here we have laws and you have . to go by the laws. If my son really did this, he has brought shame and upset on . us and he deserves to die. I wish he was dead.’ Ms Sengezer added that she thought Faye’s mother Rhonda . should not have allowed the couple to be together. She said: ‘I am trying to understand why she . let her 16-year-old daughter be with my son. As a mother I cannot understand it.’ The two wept before hugging each other . when they were reunited at the police station in the town of Mugla. ‘Why did you do it Faye? Why?’ Mrs Jones asked her daughter. ‘Do you . love him?’ While sobbing, she replied: ‘No I don’t love him. I was just frightened of what he might do.’ Faye had scratches and insect bites . over her legs from having crossed two mountains before she was found. She was treated for sunburn and minor injuries in hospital and then . interviewed by police. Faye arrived in Marmaris on June 27 . with her mother to visit her grandmother Jackie Armstrong, 68, who lives . and works in the resort. The teenager had met Can while on holiday last . year. She had secretly kept in touch through . Facebook and Skype. The pair met again last week, but on one occasion . he was aggressive to Faye in front of her mother.

A new kind of computer monitor has been developed that will be able to tell your boss if you're not paying attention at work. Researchers from the University of St Andrews say that their new system could reduce workplace distractions and increase workers' productivity. It works by having a camera mounted above the workstation display which can identify the user's eyes to see if they are looking at the computer or not. A lot to keep track of: A new system has been developed which tracks the eyes of computer workers to see if they are paying attention, which could be of use to those who have several screens to monitor . The technology is an unsettling echo of technologies being introduced in television set-top boxes to peer back at viewers and automatically serve appropriate adverts. However, the team behind the new system say their technology is not meant to keep an eye on workers, but merely to ensure they don't miss anything new which appears on their screens. They say it could be of crucial use in high-pressure environments such as air-traffic control rooms, where workers have several screens to keep tabs on. The system called 'Diff Displays', detects when its user is not looking at a display and replaces the regular screen image with a calm and non-distractive visualisation of the screen's activity instead. The system reduces distractions by fading out the parts of the screen that remain static and by subtly visualising changes in the display over time. When the user looks back at a display, the system quickly changes back from the visualisation to the actual screen content via different forms of animation. The system works via a camera mounted on top of each computer screen which uses computer vision algorithms to identify the user’s eyes. Once the eyes have been identified, the system can determine which screen they are looking at. One of the ways in which Diff Displays highlights unviewed changes on the screen: The system reduces distractions by fading out parts of the screen that remain static and subtly visualising changes over time . The researchers believe the system would be useful in everyday work situations to reduce distractions and improve the quality of life of office workers. However, it may also be particularly useful for those in high-pressure roles where they monitor a large number of screens, such as flight controllers or workers in nuclear power stations. A study of the system in action during a single work week indicated it reduced the number of times someone switched their attention between the displays. The researchers think this technology can eventually become a standard part of our operating systems. PhD student Jakub Dostal who works under the guidance of Dr Per Ola Kristensson and Professor Aaron Quigley in the School of Computer Science, said: 'In a world where displays are starting to surround us and crave for our attention, technologies that focus on inattention become ever so important. 'Diff Displays is an example of intelligent display technologies that can be rapidly deployed and have a positive impact on potentially billions of users.' The St Andrews team have made Diff Displays available as a free download for Microsoft Windows, downloadable from here.","St Andrews team develops system with camera pointing back at workers .

"By . Tamara Cohen In Brussels and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:50 EST, 27 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:19 EST, 28 June 2013 . Win: David Cameron, pictured arriving at an EU summit in Brussels, was confident of securing a deal to protect Britain's rebate . David Cameron scored a vital victory for taxpayers last night as he protected Britain’s £3.1billion EU rebate. The Prime Minister fought off a raid by France on the UK’s annual clawback of funding from Brussels. Paris said Britain’s refund should not be exempt from a deal to hand over £300million a year in taxpayer-funded farming subsidies for new member states. In a second victory for Mr Cameron, MEPs also backed down and agreed to the first ever EU budget reduction in its 56-year history. They will vote on the £30billion cut to £770billion next week. Mr Cameron blocked the refund raid after talks with European Council President Herman Van Rompuy ahead of the EU summit in Brussels. Exemption from the farming subsidy deal was a key part of the UK’s rebate settlement, agreed at landmark talks in February, but it has come under increasing attack from France. Mr Cameron said details should now be ‘locked down’ in EU law. A Downing Street source later said there were ‘assurances’ that Brussels will stick to February’s deal. The rebate was won for Britain by Baroness Thatcher in 1984 after her ‘handbagging’ of European leaders and her vow of ‘not a penny more’ for Brussels. The refund was granted because Britain get disproportionately less in farm subsidies than France. As he went into the meeting Mr Cameron said: 'It is absolutely essential that we stick to the deal we reached in February and that we protect the British rebate, and I will make sure that we do that.' A Downing Street source said afterwards: 'We have assurances from Mr Van Rompuy that we will stick to the deal done in February. We are confident this is resolved now.' Mr Cameron added: 'This council should be about doing in Brussels what we are doing in Britain, which is getting control of spending, making sure we live within our means, and then making ourselves more competitive, getting rid of regulations, making it easier for businesses to create jobs.' But despite reductions in some areas of spending such as regional aid, the cost of running the EU civil service, assembly and quangos will still rise by 1.7 per cent. And spending on the pensions of Brussels bureaucrats will rise by 7.2 per cent partly because of costs associated with an increase in officials taking early retirement. Martin Callanan MEP, the leader of the European Conservatives, said: 'This is an historic cut but we still have enormous amounts of fat that can be trimmed. 'Administration is normally the first thing to be cut in any government’s budget. Only in the EU would it increase at a time of belt-tightening.' Jobs: Mr Cameron is calling for rules to be relaxed to encourage firms to take on young people . The Prime Minister celebrated a major . diplomatic coup in Brussels in February after securing the first EU . spending cut in its history. But four months on, Francois Hollande's government launched a last-ditch attempt to slash Britain’s rebate. After talks with European Council president Herman Van Rompuy, Mr Cameron insisted the deal still stands. Under the agreement every other country with rebates had to agree to give up some of the money. Diplomats hailed it as the biggest . British triumph for the UK in an EU negotiation since the rebate was won . by Margaret Thatcher at the Fontainebleau summit almost 30 years ago. Mr Cameron’s deal will save UK . taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds on what  they would have been . forced to pay under the European Commission’s initial plans to increase . the budget. The Prime Minister arrived at a summit in Brussels insisting he would block any attempt to reduce the rebate. Mr Van Rompuy has declared improving the job prospects of young people the main theme for the two-day gathering. Battle: The Prime Minister insisted it was 'essential' that the British rebate remained protected . Some 5.6 million are out of work in the eurozone, and in Greece and Spain the youth unemployment rate has rocketed to over 50 per cent. Mr Van Rompuy is emphasising the need for money to be pumped into projects that could boost their employment chances. But Mr Cameron is due to argue that loosening labour market rules and freeing up small and medium companies to take on young staff is more important. He has staked Britain's continuing membership of the EU on his ability to negotiate fundamental reform of it - with an in-out referendum due to be held in 2017 if the Tories win the general election. Mr Cameron could also face questions from German chancellor Angela Merkel and others after it emerged that eavesdropping agency GCHQ has been mass-monitoring global phone and internet traffic. Berlin has openly challenged the validity of the Project Tempora surveillance operation, the existence of which was revealed by US National Security Agency whistle-blower Edward Snowden.","Leaders agreed to an £819billion budget 'ceiling' in February .

The lights are on but no one is at home at the headquarters of three of Britain’s largest energy companies - days after they announced huge price hikes. In pictures which will anger customers across Britain, npower, Centrica and SSE appear content to burn the midnight oil in their own offices long after most workers have gone home. The apparently deserted npower offices in Warndon, Worcester, are seen in the photographs to boast an empty car park bathed in light from the thousands of bulbs still burning at 7pm on Monday evening. Days after announcing energy price hikes the headquarters of three of Britain's biggest energy companies, including the offices of npower in Warndon, Worcester, were bathed in light despite many workers having left for the day . Although many staff had left for the day when this photograph of the npower building was taken, lights were still on in the building. The firm recently announced an increase including an electricity price rise of 9.3 per cent and a gas price rise of 11.1 per cent . Earlier this month the company became the third major supplier to announce price rises, with a dual-fuel bill set to go up by a whopping 10.4 per cent. The price rise will take effect on December 1, and is the highest increase announced by any supplier so far. The npower increase includes an electricity price rise of 9.3 per cent and a gas price rise of 11.1 per cent. The move will affect 3.1 million customers. The change will add an extra £137 to an annual average dual-fuel bill, taking it to £1,459. Furious customer John Sadford, 30, who lives nearby, said: 'It’s an absolute joke that they can jack up everyone’s energy bill while lighting up their own office like a Christmas tree when virtually no one is there. The startling scene was repeated at the head office of Centrica in Windsor, Berkshire, which was still lit up at 6.45pm . Centrica, parent company to British Gas, recently announced an increase of 8.4 per cent on gas and 10.4 per cent on electricity which will come into force on November 23 . 'It’s a kick in the teeth for customers like me who already struggle to make ends meet.' The startling scene was repeated at the HQ of Centrica in Windsor, Berkshire, which was still lit up at 6.45pm. The firm, parent company to British Gas, announced an increase of 8.4 per cent on gas and 10.4 per cent on electricity which will come into force on November 23. Meanwhile in Scotland, the offices of SSE, formerly Scottish and Southern Energy, in Perth had just a handful of cars in the car park at 7.30pm on Monday, yet every light appeared to be on in the sprawling offices. Earlier this month the company unveiled an 8.2 per cent price rise for its 4.4 million electricity customers and 2.9 million gas users, despite announcing £1.41 billion pre-tax profits in March. Under pressure customers will see their annual dual fuel bill rise by £106 to £1,380 when the hike comes into effect on November 15. One of those customers is Gary Waywell, 56, from Watchet, Somerset, who has been a SSE customer for eight years. The offices of SSE, formerly Scottish and Southern Energy, in Perth, Scotland, had just a handful of cars in the car park, yet every light appeared to be on in the sprawling offices . Earlier this month SSE unveiled an 8.2 per cent price rise for its 4.4 million electricity customers and 2.9 million gas users, despite announcing £1.41 billion pre-tax profits in March . He said he was surprised by the size of the price rise and angry at the timing just before winter. 'I can hardly go to my boss and say, ‘would you mind giving me an extra £16 a week for the winter.' he said. 'I don’t think he is going to smile at that.' All three of the energy companies photographed have been approached for comment. The move has amplified political debate about the issue of energy bills. Labour leader Ed Miliband, who pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election, described SSE’s price rise as a 'scandal'. Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged to freeze energy prices if his party is elected, although Prime Minister David Cameron has branded the promise a 'con', saying his rival could not control the price of gas worldwide . He has accused the government of 'letting energy companies get away with this'. However, Prime Minister David Cameron branded Mr Miliband’s price freeze plan as a 'con', saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas. Even the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Right Reverend Justin Welby, himself a former oil executive, has stepped into the row when he said he understood the anger over apparently ‘inexplicable’ rises and called on the companies ‘to behave with generosity and not merely to maximise opportunity’. He hit out after British Gas announced a 9.2 per cent hike, despite parent company Centrica recording a £2.7 billion profit last year.","Lights on at npower, Centrica and SSE offices after most workers had left .

Missy leads the colony around their enclosure - despite having to use a carefully deployed flipper to steady her way . She might be a tough old bird, but that hasn't stopped her waddling her way into the record books. Missy the penguin will claim the crown as the oldest in the world after reaching 36 years old - a staggering 108 in human years. The ancient King penguin arrived at the Birdland wildlife park in Gloucestershire when she was at least five years old in 1982 - and despite losing the sight in one eye she is still the leader of the colony today. Keepers had no idea that she was the world's oldest until a zoo in Denmark claimed the title with a Gentoo penguin two years younger than Missy. Staff at Birdland Park and Gardens, in Bourton-on-the-Water are now planning to send her details to the Guinness World Records to prove she has smashed the record. King penguins - Aptenodytes patagonicus in Latin - are only expected to live up to 26 years in captivity, much more than the 15-20 years life expectancy in the wild. Missy spends most of her time with her partner of 18 years, Seth, who is thought to be 34 years old and had a starring role in the 1992 film Batman Returns. Simon Blackwell, park manager, said: 'The Danish zoo recently announced they believed that a Gentoo penguin there was the world's oldest living penguin having reached the age of 34 in May. 'Although we cannot categorically age Missy we do know she was an adult when she came to Birdland and king penguins take five years to become fully mature. 'Therefore she must be, at the very least, 36 years old and she could actually be significantly older. 'King penguins live to be around 26 years old on average in captivity, and even less in the wild due to predators and diseases. The old couple: Missy (right) with partner Seth arrived at the Birdland wildlife park when she was at least five-years-old in 1982 . Despite her old age her keepers had no idea that she was the World's oldest, until a zoo in Denmark claimed the title with a Gentoo penguin two years younger than Missy . 'You really wouldn't know Missy's old age to look at her, she acts like all of the other penguins here. 'The fact that she can only see out of one eye doesn't appear to have slowed her down at all. 'She uses one of her wings as a guide against the side of her enclosure to help her navigate her way around. 'We believe she is the oldest penguin in the world and we are planning to look into applying with the Guiness World Records.' King penguins are distinguishable by their orange tinted breasts, cheeks, and beaks. They are the second largest species of penguin, can weigh up to 40lbs, and can dive to over 330ft at a time.","Missy the King Penguin arrived at Gloucestershire wildlife park in 1982 .

Johnston, of Norwich, admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm before city magistrates. The driver, who has not been named, was on his way to work. He was sitting with a colleague at the front of the vehicle as it approached the bus station when he was attacked. The bizarre incident caused huge early morning rush-hour disruption as the air ambulance was scrambled to the scene. Johnston had mistaken the man for someone who she claimed had threatened her in Dereham two days before, the court heard. Lisa Britton, prosecuting, said the driver got on the number 8 Konectbus 7.35am service from Dereham to Norwich with a colleague at about 7.10am on May 1. Miss Britton said: 'After about 20 minutes the defendant boarded the bus. 'She approached the victim and asked if she could take his seat. He got up and sat next to his colleague.

A schizophrenic mass murderer who believes he is the 'Prince of God' will be executed in Florida tonight after an appeals court lifted a last-minute stay that was based on his mental illness. John Errol Ferguson, 64, will be put to death by lethal injection at Florida State Prison at 6pm on Tuesday, a State Department of Corrections spokesperson confirmed. Ferguson has spent more than three decades on death row for eight brutal killings, including those of a teenage couple, in 1977 and 1978. He was originally due to be executed on . October 16, but it was delayed for a state judge to determine whether . Ferguson was mentally competent to be put to death. Life behind bars: John Errol Ferguson, 64, has been on Death Row for 34 years for killing eight people in the 1970s and will be put to death on Tuesday. His lawyers argue that he is mentally ill . After two days of testimony, including that from a panel of psychiatrists appointed by Gov. Rick Scott, the judge agreed Ferguson did understand why he was being executed. But on Saturday, another South Florida judge issued a stay as Ferguson's lawyers continued to argue he is mentally ill and therefore cannot be executed. Victim: He raped and shot Belinda Worley, 17, as she went for ice cream . with her boyfriend in January 1978. Her boyfriend was also shot dead . 'A man who thinks he is the immortal . Prince of God and who believes he is incarcerated because of a Communist . plot quite clearly has no rational understanding of the effect of his . looming execution and the reason for it,' his lawyer, Christopher Handman, said in a statement. Lawyers added it was a 'cruel and unusual punishment' for a mentally ill man. Yet now the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta have lifted the stay, ruling that U.S. Judge Daninel Hurley 'abused' his discretion on Saturday when he issued it. Handman said he was disappointed the stay was lifted even though one of the three Appeals judges was against it. He said he is hopeful the Supreme Court will reverse the decision. 'There is no evidence that Mr. Ferguson has a rational understanding of the reason for, and effect of, his execution,' he said. The lawyers argued that an inmate's awareness of his execution - a standard set in 2007 - is not enough and the inmate must have a 'rational understanding' - a higher standard . than 'awareness'. His execution comes more than three decades after his horrific killing and raping spree in the 1970s. When Ferguson was 21, he stole a deputy's gun and was going to shoot when the deputy . reached for another gun and shot the man four times - including once in . the head. When he left hospital, 'he began to show serious mental . instability, irrational thinking, unexplainable hostility and grossly . impaired intelligence,' his lawyers said. Legal wrangling: The death has been granted after judges ruled he is aware of why he is being executed . John Errol Ferguson was sentenced to death for eight killings in 1977 and 1978, although some investigators believe he killed even more. May 1977: An elderly couple who were in the area for a funeral were found beaten, tied up and shot dead in their motel room. The gun was used in Ferguson's later crimes but he was not charged as there was no other corroborating evidence. July 1977: With three others, Ferguson broke into a house and tied up eight people and shot them in the heads. Livingstone Stocker, 33, Michael Miller, 24, Henry Clayton, 35, John Holmes, 26, Gilbert Williams, 37, and Charles Cesar Stinson, 35, all died. Two survived: Johnnie Hall, 45, and Margaret Wooden, 24. He was convicted of the killings. October 1977: Posing as a police officer, he shot two teenagers during an attempted robbery. They survived. January 1978: Shot and killed Brian Glenfeldt, 17, on his way to get ice cream with his girlfriend, Belinda Worley. Belinda, 17, was raped and also shot. He was convicted of the killings. In May 1977, an elderly couple who were in the area for a funeral were . found beaten, tied up and shot dead in their motel room. While Ferguson . was never convicted of these murders, the same handgun was used in a . later crime of which he was found guilty. The crime was the slaying of the 'Carol City Six' in a home-invasion robbery in July 1977 - the worst mass murder in Dade history at the time. With two others, Ferguson entered a home under the guise of electrical . worker and tied up eight people, aged between 24 and 45, before . shooting them in the heads. Two survived. Three months later, Ferguson posed as a police officer and shot two teenagers during an attempted robbery but again the couple survived. Then in January 1978, he shot and killed Brian Glenfeldt, 17, and . Belinda Worley, 17, as they stopped off at a lover's lane on the way to . get ice cream after leaving a Christian youth meeting. Investigators said Ferguson had shot Brian in the head before chasing Belinda from the car and raping her. She was found shot dead in a wooded area. Detectives found that the gun used to kill the young couple had been . stolen from the Carol City home. Four months after, police tracked down . Ferguson and arrested him. Six months later, he was found guilty in two separate cases of the six . killings and the murder of the couple and sentenced to death. 'He was a pretty vicious man,' retired Judge Robert . Kaye, who put Ferguson on Death Row in 1978, told the Miami Herald. 'We had . pretty good information that he killed at least 12 people.' Fate: Ferguson will be put to death in Florida State Prison by lethal injection at 6pm on Tuesday . Over the years, Ferguson's lawyers have wrangled with the courts to throw out his death sentence, while two of his three 1977 accomplices have already been executed. In 1982, the Florida Supreme Court threw out the death sentence due to his mental illness, but the following year he was sentenced to death again - leading to years more of failed appeals. Michael Worley, Belinda's brother and only surviving relative, told The Miami Herald that he is upset over years of delays, and saddened that his mother is no longer alive to witness the execution. 'Outrageous is the fact that for 34 years, our tax dollars have been keeping Ferguson alive. Free food, medical care and the ability to communicate with his loved ones and lawyers,' he said. 'My sister was brutally killed at the age of 17. Her murder shattered our entire family. Life was never the same.'","John Errol Ferguson convicted of killing 8 people in 1970s murder spree .

Scroll down for more . Bartender Joe Ardizzone brought the house down at a Manhattan piano bar recently with his near faultless version of Radiohead's Creep . A video of the heartfelt performance was posted by customer Cody Littlewood who wrote: ‘We were at a piano bar as it was closing down and the bartender stepped up to the mic and did this. ‘He had been behind the bar working a full shift and shouting over the noise for several hours at least.’ Littlewood went on to apologize for his ‘amateur’ vertical filming, but regardless of the quality of the video the clip is well worth watching for the quality of Ardizzone’s singing. An absolute natural, he performs with complete control of his voice and gives a soulful rendition of the song without feeling the need to resort to vocal histrionics or posing to entertain the crowd.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:17 EST, 21 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:49 EST, 21 October 2013 . A special prosecutor has been appointed in the Daisy Coleman rape case to re-investigate allegations that the 14-year-old cheerleader was sexually assaulted by an older classmate who plied her with alcohol. Coleman has also alleged that a second 17-year-old boy recorded the January 2012 incident in the small northwest Missouri town of Maryville using cellphone video. Today's announcement is a victory for Melinda Coleman, Daisy's mother, who said she is looking forward to answering . questions in a new review of the case. Victory for Daisy? Coleman has accused Maryville, Missouri teens Matthew Barnett, 19, and Jordan Zech of raping her when she was 14 in January 2012, and now a special prosecutor has been appointed in to re-investigate the case . Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker will re-investigate the rape allegations made by Daisy Coleman . Melinda Coleman told CNN that she and her daughter just want to be heard and to have the case looked at 'fairly, and with some enthusiasm.' 'We were disappointed that they didn't really do the job. They didn't really collect the evidence, and they didn't seem to care from the beginning. Anything above that would just be extra,' she said. The case has drawn international . attention to the town after a seven-month investigation published last . week by the Kansas City Star raised questions about the transparency of . the process. Felony charges against both boys were . dropped last year after Nodaway County prosecutor Robert Rice said Daisy . and her family stopped cooperating with the investigation. A claim denied by Daisy's mom. The newspaper's story described a town . where many appeared to be closing ranks around the accused and blaming . the girl. In the wake of the fresh scrutiny, Rice asked for a special prosecutor to be appointed and it was announced on Monday that Jackson County prosecutor Jean Peters Baker had accepted the high profile case. Reopened: Charges against Matthew Barnett, left, and Jordan Zech will be revisited, but news of the circumstances under which they were dropped in March 2012 has the town of Maryville, Missouri taking sides and has the public eager for justice in the case of Daisy Coleman's rape accusations . 'Your son is going to get a bullet through his head': The A&G restaurant in town has become the focus of threats from hacktivist group Anonymous, though the owners aren't associated with the accused rapists . She has promised to review the case 'without fear and without favor.' 'I can also assure you that politics, connections or any other reason you can think of will not play a role in our review of this case. It will be the evidence, as it is in every case that we review,' Jean Peters Baker said. Residents . of Maryville claim they’re now besieged by threats and in-fighting thanks . to the attention that the case has had in the past week. Townspeople . fear they’re being cast as villains as the case of the new girl in town . who accused two popular teens of rape - only to have the charges . suddenly dropped - which is now being reopened. As . the residents are forced to choose sides, news viewers across the . country eager to create their own justice have even begun to threaten . people related to the case using phone calls and the internet. Matthew . Barnett, now 19, and Jordan Zech, were accused by then 14-year-old . Daisy Coleman of rape after she and a friend went drinking with the boys . in January 2012. In . the months after the case was dropped because of an apparent lack of . evidence, Daisy’s mother Melinda Coleman has been on a quest to get . justice for her daughter. 'The media have made us look like a bunch of scum': National media scrutiny has many residents, even those who haven't chosen a side in the case, seething. It's done a disservice to Maryville,' said Mahlon Fairchild, 83 . Opening up: Paige Parkhurst Borland, seen here with her mother, was with Daisy on the night of the alleged rape. She said that the ordeal was 'very scary' She . and her family were new in town, and Barnett’s family had local . political connections that some believed helped him and his buddy get . off scot-free despite Daisy’s allegations she was given a ‘clear liquid’ that left her incapacitated before she was raped. And . it all came to a head after the Kansas City Star published the . Coleman’s story last weekend and Daisy’s story appeared on just about . every internet news outlet. Many residents say it put them in an unfair light. ‘The . worst thing to my wife and me is that we have this wonderful little . town here and you (the media) have made us look like a bunch of scum,’ 83-year-old Mahlon Fairchild told this Kansas City Star. ‘It’s done a disservice to Maryville, a disservice to our legal system. We’re hurting. We’re hurting. It’s explosive.’ The case has lit a fire under so called online ‘hacktivist’ group Anonymous, who’ve made threats to physically harm some residents and to destroy their property and livelihood. Scrutiny: Daisy, at right with her mom Melinda, has graced covers and homepages of major media since news of her saga went national last weekend. The town of Maryville has also become the focus of intense scrutiny, much to its chagrin . Dig deep: Shirley Barnett, left, is the mother . of Matthew Barnett, 19, one of the high school footballers accused of . raping Daisy Coleman. She called on everybody to 'dig deeper to find the . truth' around the case and said her son is the real victim in the case threats on her son's safety pour into the tiny town . 'We're hurting. It's explosive': The home Daisy shared with her family was mysteriously burned after they left town. A threat to torch the Maryville high school has since come from a California Twitter user . The owners of the A&G Greek . restaurant in town say they get threatening phone calls every day, and . though their son was attended the party where Daisy claims to have been . assaulted, he was not implicated in the crime. ‘We got a phone call last night: “Your son is going to get a bullet through his head,”’ one of the owners said Saturday. Their business’s Yelp review page has been hit by Anonymous, too. ‘SO GENEROUS!’ read such post before administrators removed it. ‘Even once you’re stuffed, they keep bringing you food — almost like it’s against your will! When I told them to stop, they smiled and reassured me that I was asking for it.’ In a statement, Anonymous expressed their outright support of Daisy. 'We demand an immediate investigation into the handling by local authorities of (the victim’s) case. If Maryville won’t defend these young girls, if the police are too cowardly or corrupt to do their jobs, if the justice system has abandoned them, then we will have to stand for them. Mayor Jim Fall, your hands are dirty. Maryville, expect us.' Rumors: All parties involved with the alleged sexual assault attended Maryville High School. Rumors now abound about bomb threats being called into the school and its football field . Second chances: Though she and her family have fled Marylville, wedged in the center of the ongoing saga is Daisy Coleman. Her case, according to county prosecutors, will now be revisited . Nodaway County prosecuting attorney Robert L. Rice, who says neither politics nor connections played a role in his decision not to pursue the charges, has asked for a special prosecutor to reopen the felony case. Meanwhile, threats and division within the towns own ranks continue. Resident Tess Fornander, 46, fears what her 11-year-old daughter could be exposed to in the town. ‘I didn’t want her to even possibly hear anything about the girl being wrong,’ she told the Star. ‘Her house was burned down. She had to leave town. It’s just crazy.’ Indeed, the home where Daisy lived with her family was mysteriously burned after the family fled town. Perhaps to make a statement about the fire, a Twitter user in California posted declared he would burn down the high school. Murmuring about bomb threats have also fluttered through town, though they are unfounded. Barnett’s mother Shirley Barnett, who has staunchly defended her son, has called on the public leave the townspeople alone. 'There are universities in the state with children from Maryville and they are having to be walked to class because of threats made over the internet, threats that are being made to them. It’s getting worse and worse,’ Barnett told MailOnline last week. Former school superintendent Roland Tullberg said opinions of his town are worsening, too. ‘It makes Maryville, to people at a distance across the land, look like a community that doesn’t care about the individual. I want you to know that this community is a very fine community,’ he told the Star. ‘It makes people think we don’t care. We do care.’","Jackson County prosecutor Jean Peters Baker will lead a re-investigation of the rape allegations made by Daisy Coleman .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 22:32 EST, 21 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 22:32 EST, 21 October 2013 . Shamed U.S. cyclist Lance Armstrong was at the head of an 'organized mafia and he literally tried to destroy people' and he 'belongs in jail.' That's according to cycling great Greg LeMond, who gave a scathing critique of his sport's most recognizable athlete during an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper on Monday night. According to LeMond, Armstrong would have been a 'top 30 at best' cyclist if not for his now-infamous doping regiment and he is 'not capable of winning the Tour de France' if not for the help of banned substances. 'Criminal': Greg LeMond (left) says that shamed cyclist Lance Armstrong (right) belongs in jail . In 2012, Armstrong was banned from competitive cycling and he was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles over his admitted use of performance enhancing drugs. Stripping Armstrong of his titles leaves LeMond as the only American to ever win the prestigious race. After years of denials, Armstrong admitted in January that he had in fact used performance enhancing drugs during a much-hyped interview with Oprah Winfrey. LeMond is one of the first people to suggest that Armstrong was using banned substances. In 2001, he questioned his relationship with Michele Ferrari, a doctor linked to several doping scandals. In April, LeMond spoke at a symposium in Austin, Texas, where he told the crowd that he had 'no vendetta' against Armstrong and that 'I don't rejoice' in the fact that he was stripped of his Tour de France titles. Cheater: Armstrong admitted earlier this year that he used performance enhancing drugs during his career as a cyclist . However, he was much more critical of Armstrong during his interview with Cooper. When asked whether Armstrong perpetrated the biggest fraud in sports history, LeMond responded with 'Absolutely. Absolutely. The greatest fraud was that, I mean, I know his . physical capabilities. He's a top 30 at best. I mean, at best. No matter . what. If he was clean and everybody else was clean, he's a top 30 at . best. He's not capable of winning the Tour. He's not capable of the top 5.' He went on to say that Armstrong's offenses are 'criminal' and that 'this is not a sporting infraction.' 'This was an organized mafia and he literally tried to destroy people,' LeMond said. He went on to say that Armstrong belongs in jail. Armstrong was at the center of a federal criminal fraud investigation until the Justice Department abandoned the investigation last year without an explanation. Banned: Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and banned from the sport for using PEDs . However, there is still an open civil case against Armstrong claiming that he defrauded the U.S. Postal Service - his primary sponsor - out of $40 million. The USPS says it never would have sponsored Armstrong - or paid him the millions of dollars in sponsorship money - had it known he was using performance enhancing drugs. LeMond has won the Tour de France three times.","LeMond won the Tour de France three times .

A 600-year-old medieval boat has been uncovered by archaeologists working on a flooding project in the Norfolk Broads. The remains of the oak timber frame boat, said to have been well-preserved, have been hailed as a 'rare and important' find by the team. The six-metre boat, thought to date back to 1400, was found by archaeologists excavating a drainage dyke along the River Chet, near Loddon. A six-metre oak timber boat, thought to date from 1400, has been discovered along the River Chet near Loddon by archaeologists . The 'significant' find contains wooden pegs, iron nails and copper alloy nails and looks to have been waterproofed with a mixture of animal hair and tar. Archaeologist Heather Wallis told the BBC: 'No boats of this date have previously been found in Norfolk. 'This has had a strong reliance on water transport and related industries, particularly since the creation of the Broads by peat digging in the medieval period. The boat, which would have had a sail, may have been used to carry light goods along the river. 'This area has had a strong reliance on water transport and related industries, particularly since the creation of the Broads by peat digging in the medieval period,' Ms Wallis told the Eastern Daily Press. 'We cannot be entirely sure how the boat was propelled, but it is likely to have been sailed and/or rowed or quanted down the river.' The team were excavating while preparing for a flood defence project along the River Chet in the Norfolk Broads (file photo) Now the team plans to recover the boat from its resting place so they can perform tests on the wood and date it. Eventually, the boat will be freeze-dried and preserved for life in a Norfolk museum. 'Some of the planks on the side of the boat are quite loosely in place so we'll be removing them separately to put into wet storage,' said Ms Wallis. The work which led to the discovery is part of the Broadland Flood Alleviation Project to improve the area's projection from rising waters.","The six-metre oak timber frame was found along River Chet, near Loddon .

From a Renoir still life to evocative Monet landscapes, there are few paintings that artist Susie Ray cannot copy. So similar to the originals are her works, even art experts have trouble telling the difference. And while it might sound like an odd choice of career, according to Susie, demand for copies is soaring - not least from museums who use them when the original work is being cleaned or restored. Copy: Susie Ray's replica of this painting by Edouard Manet is almost identical to the original (below) Manet's original: The real A Bunch of Asparagus (1880) hangs in the Wallraf Richartz Museum in Cologne . 'I have been reproducing great master works to a very high standard throughout my career, and as a result it is quite difficult for the untrained eye to tell the difference,' explains Susie. 'Even experts have missed the fact that my painting was the copied version. My paintings have hung in galleries when the real painting was on loan, and people were none the wiser.' So what makes a good copy? Susie, whose paintings sell for between £600 and £9,000 depending on the complexity of the work, says it's all about getting the style, technique and ageing spot on. 'Each painting is thoroughly researched,' she reveals. 'The correct size canvas has to be selected and primed, aged and executed in . oil paint to ensure not only the look, but also the texture and feel of . the painting, is as close to the original as possible. 'The . best copyist paintings are ones that have the same texture, colour and . age as the original. Popular: Renoir's Cauliflower and Pomegranates is in a private collection but Susie was still able to copy it . Detailed: Susie's version of this Renoir still life faithfully recreates the French painter's impressionist style . Spot the difference: Susie Ray's version of Samuel Peploe's Pink Roses in a Vase (left) and the original (right) Many of Susie's works are copies of Impressionist paintings - a genre that has proved popular with clients. The 19th century art movement originated in Paris during the 1870s and 1880s, in the face of opposition from the conventional art community who objected to the lack of sharp lines and contours, and artistic detail. Instead, Impressionist works focus on recording a moment and are characterised by thin, visible brush strokes. Among the most famous of the Impressionists are Claude Monet, Edouard Manet, Pierre Auguste Renoir, Paul Cézanne, Alfred Sisley and Camille Pissarro. 'As a copyist, it is important I do not have a . style of my own, as each painting must look like it is by the [original] artist.' Despite the illegal-sounding nature of her business, Susie says everything is entirely above board and that clients know exactly what they're buying when they purchase one of her copies. 'Everything I do is completely within . copyright law, and I would never pass off one of my paintings as the . real deal,' she explains. 'I adhere strictly to copyright laws which permit copying 70 . years after the original artist has died, and more contemporary artists . continue to come into circulation. This is why my work tends to focus on . the great masters. 'It . is up to the purchaser what they tell their friends [about] the painting. If they pass it off as the real deal then it is up to them and out . of my control.' Copyright concerns notwithstanding, Susie admits that the toughest part of recreating great art is accommodating idiosyncratic techniques. 'It . is often the simplest looking paintings that are the hardest to copy, . as the dips and the quick brush strokes are harder to copy . than the great masters,' she explains, adding that each work takes around three months to complete. The artist at work: Susie at home in the Cornish studio where she creates her copies of famous paintings . Favourite: Copies of Claude Monet's paintings, including this one, are especially popular with clients . Identical: Claude Monet's 1886 painting Storm on Belle-Isle is among Susie's portfolio of copies . 'For example. Modigliani’s pen and ink sketches are very hard to copy due to the spontaneous approach of the drawing.' So would she ever attempt an original work of her own? Surprisingly, Susie says she would never even consider it. 'No,' she says. 'I'm not a fine artist, and don't have a style of my own. Having said that, I . do enjoy doing illustration and water colour from time to time and I . also enjoy photography.' It would seem there's no end to Susie Ray's artistic talents.

Millions of struggling families across the U.S. will be hit with more financial woes over the holidays when food stamp benefits are reduced in November. The food stamp plan, called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, will be reducing its benefits as of November 1 because the financial boost it received during the recession-era is expiring. SNAP helps over 23 million U.S. households, totaling around 48 million people, which has steadily increased over recent years due to a weak economy and high unemployment. A girl pictured paying for her mother's groceries using Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) tokens, more commonly known as Food Stamps, in New York (file photo) The average monthly benefit per household is $275, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This amount could drop by around $36 less per month after November 1. Exact cuts in benefits will depend on each household’s situation, but the $36 is based on a family of four with no other changes in circumstances, according to the USDA. ‘For those of us who spend $1.70 a day on a latte, this doesn’t seem like a big change, but it does kind of really highlight that millions of families are living on an extremely modest food budget’, VP for food assistance policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities told NBCnews.com. The cuts will bring the benefits back in line to where they were in the mid-2000s, before being boosted during the recession. SNAP data showing households using the program and costs from June 2010 to 2013 . The aim for lawmakers is to slash their SNAP budget over years to come – with a bill passed in September by the House of Representatives to save $39 billion from SNAP over the next decade. This might see some families being cut from the program completely.

The doggy diva was replaced by theatre bosses just days before opening night at London's Gielgud Theatre because she would not obey Dame Helen, who portrays the Queen as she meets various prime ministers over her 61-year reign.

Unfortunately, Lizzie ignored her commands and eventually producers, tired of her obstinacy, instead appointed understudy Katie to take her place. Stephen Daldry, the director, said Lizzy was spot on for the first three shows but began misbehaving soon after. He told The Sunday Telegraph: 'She was excited the first three times, and then I think she decided she didn't want to be an actress anymore. 'She decided to retire from the British stage. Now she's at home, a resting actress, resting by the fire.' Dave Jordan, of Animal Actors, the agency that provides the thespian hounds, said homesickness was behind Lizzie's sudden change of heart.

'The understudy is doing OK, touch wood, but we've got another one just in case.' Lizzie has been used numerous times by Queen look-a-likes keen on an extra touch of authenticity.  She lives at home with her owner Mrs Davey, who has five other corgis.

Mr Daldry, who directed Oscar-nominated films Billy Elliot and The Hours, added: 'People seem to think corgis nip and yap, but all the ones we work with - including dear old Lizzy - have been gorgeous. Producers, unfazed by Lizzie's behaviour, are planning to add a scene with a live pony. It is being put in by the play's writer Peter Morgan, who also wrote the screenplay for The Queen.

Shamed TV presenter Stuart Hall is to be stripped of his OBE admitting a series of indecent assaults against girls as young as nine. The former It's A Knockout was jailed for 15 months in June but after widespread public outrage over the 'unduly lenient' prison term, his sentence was doubled at the Court of Appeal. He was awarded the OBE just last year for his services to television and charity but an official announcement that the Queen has revoked the honour is expected to be published in the London Gazette this afternoon. Disgrace: Former TV presenter Stuart Hall is to be stripped of his OBE following his jailing for indecently assaulting girls as young as nine . In April his son Daniel said it 'would not be fair' for Hall to lose his OBE. 'My father's massive work for charity for 50 years, for which he was awarded an OBE, and a lifetime of good work should not be whitewashed in one brushstroke,' he added. Hall and his family were leading fundraisers in the North-West and MPs signed a motion in the House of Commons in 1999 congratulating Hall on four decades in broadcasting. But Hall was described as an 'opportunist predator' by the Crown Prosecution Service. Jailed: The 84-year-old saw his 15-month sentence doubled after a widespread public outcry . The 84-year-old from Wilmslow, Cheshire, admitted 14 counts of indecent assault against girls aged between nine and 17 over a period of almost 20 years after initially denying the allegations. Lancashire Police confirmed last month that they had received 'further allegations' about the veteran broadcaster. He is expected to be questioned over fresh claims of sexual assault after a woman complained that he had raped her. Anyone who has been sentenced to three months prison or more can have their honour cancelled at the discretion of the forfeiture committee, which is led by the country’s top civil servant, Sir Bob Kerslake. Fred Goodwin, the disgraced former Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive, was stripped of his knighthood after taxpayers were forced to bail out his bank. It had been given for services to the financial services industry, which was on the brink of collapse. In 1979 art historian Anthony Blunt, who was personal adviser to the Queen on art, was stripped of his knighthood after being exposed as the Fourth Man in the Burgess, Maclean and Philby spy scandal. The boxer ‘Prince’ Naseem Hamed was stripped of his MBE in 2007 by the forfeiture committee after serving a sentence for dangerous driving.

He said he was 'confident of victory' 'If we were not sure . that we were going to win in Syria, we would not have the ability to . resist and the ability to continue fighting for more than two years . against the enemy,' Assad was quoted as saying by state news agency . SANA. Insurgents have seized . large swathes of territory, but Assad's forces have staged a . counter-offensive in recent weeks, pushing them back from around the . capital Damascus and retaking several towns near the border with . Lebanon. Assad has framed the revolt against four decades of his family's rule as a foreign-backed conspiracy fought by Islamist 'terrorists'. More than 100,000 people have been killed since the uprising against the Assad family's four-decade rule began in March 2011. The revolt later escalated into a civil war, which has uprooted millions of people from their homes. U.N. investigators say Assad's forces have carried out war crimes including unlawful killing, torture, sexual violence, indiscriminate attacks and pillaging in what appears to be a state-directed policy. They say rebels have also committed war crimes, including executions, but on a lesser scale. Both sides accuse the other of using chemical weapons and - after months of diplomatic wrangling between the United Nations and Damascus over access - a chemical weapons investigation team will visit three sites where alleged attacks have occurred, the United Nations said on Wednesday. It is hard to say if the trip will be able to establish who was behind the attacks. Injured: . A video posted on Facebook and YouTube appears to show victims of a . Syrian regime assault on Aleppo foaming at the mouth suggesting the use . of sarin gas . One attack in the northern town of Khan al-Assal was in March and samples of Sarin gas - a fast-acting nerve agent that was originally developed in 1938 in Germany as a pesticide - can degrade very quickly, within weeks. Rebels also seized Khan al-Assal from Assad's forces last week so access to the site could be hard from the government side. There is still fighting in the area. At best, weapons inspectors will only determine scientifically whether banned chemical agents were used in the 28-month-old conflict, and not who used them, according to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which works with the United Nations on inspections. Members of the 15-person team assembled by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon had been on standby in Cyprus since April and have only last month went to Turkey to gather evidence. The U.N. chemical weapons experts cannot enter Syria without the government's permission. The struggle in Syria has become markedly sectarian, broadly pitting majority Sunni Muslim rebels against Assad's minority Alawite sect, which is an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam. Assad has relied on Alawite-led army units and security forces from the start, but has turned increasingly to loyalist militia armed and funded by Damascus to fight the rebels. He has also received solid support from Shi'ite regional powerhouse Iran, Lebanon's Hezbollah movement and longtime ally Russia, while his fragmented foes have received little military aid from their Western backers, wary of the growing presence of hardline Islamist groups, some of which are linked to al Qaeda. Nine European Union nations urged the European Parliament on Thursday to back plans for an EU-wide passenger data list aimed at thwarting suspected militants travelling from Europe to fight in Syria, fearing they will return to home to carry out attacks in Europe.","Series of blasts sent giant fireball into the sky causing widespread panic .

Tax scheme: Kelly Brook promotes the new more expensive Lotto draw for Camelot this month, which has today been accused of avoiding £10m in corporation tax . National Lottery owner Camelot has today been accused of avoiding at least £10million in corporation tax by exploiting a loophole that HMRC knows about but has never closed. Just weeks after the cost of a Lotto ticket doubled to £2, it emerged the Canadian-owned business has used a legal fiddle based in a tax haven. To take advantage of the loophole, Camelot reportedly took out high-interest loans from its parent company via the Channel Islands Stock Exchange. They then used the giant interest payments these generated to reduce their profits, which may have saved them at least £10million in tax since April 2010. At least 30 companies are said to use this loophole, which may have taken away up to £500million each year from the taxman, according to Corporate Watch and The Independent. Last year the Government revealed it knew about the scheme, estimating it was losing £200million a year, but has still failed to shut it down after speaking to accountancy firms and big business. Chair of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, Margaret Hodge has said she will take HMRC to task over the issue at a hearing next week. 'I find it extraordinary that HMRC could be so naive as to send . out a consultation document on closing a tax loophole to a group of . vested interests, including some of the very people who benefit, or . whose clients benefit, from it – and then accept their response . seemingly without challenge,' she told The Independent. Corporate Watch say that Camelot could have avoided £10million in corporation tax after accruing £38.7million of interest on £172.6million it owes to its owner the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan. Loans are taken out at around 12.5 per cent rather than the five per cent offered by UK banks because it is more tax efficient. Tax haven: Camelot has apparently taken out high-interest loans via the Channel Islands (pictured), which then allows them to reduce their profits and therefore their corporation tax bill . But Camelot said today that 'their analysis of our figures is inaccurate', but did not deny using the loophole. 'Camelot complies fully with all UK regulatory, tax and legal requirements – and is a very significant UK taxpayer,' a spokesman said. 'In fact, in the period reported by the Independent, Camelot paid UK taxes well in excess of £1.5 billion. 'This figure included lottery duty, corporation tax and (non-recoverable) VAT. During the same period, Camelot generated almost £3.5billion for National Lottery Good Causes across the UK and paid out over £6.2billion in prizes to players. 'Camelot’s strategy for long-term, responsible growth has seen it grow total National Lottery sales by over 50 per cent in the last decade – meaning that it now raises over £35million for National Lottery Good Causes each week.' HMRC refused to say why it did not shut the loophole and said: 'For legal reasons, HMRC cannot comment on the affairs of individual taxpayers.'","Investigation finds business taking high-interest loans to cut profit and tax .

The number of white children being born in Washington D.C. has risen by 34 per cent, showing the capital is going through a baby boom. New figures released by the US Census Bureau suggested the number of infants and toddlers under the age of five has grown in the district by five per cent up to 39,000. The statistics also highlighted the number of children aged between five and 13 had risen by seven per cent, but teenagers older than 14 were declining. Baby boom: The number of white infants and toddlers being born in Washington D.C. has risen by 34 per cent . The rise among white infants and toddlers is being attributed to new parents in their 30s and early 40s. Demographer William Frey of the Brookings Institution told the Washington Post a similar phenomenon is occurring in urban centres such as Manhattan, where young white professionals have settled and established lives before marriage and children. He said: 'They came for the bright lights of the city, and started dating and mating.' The drop in teenagers was blamed on families leaving the city before their sons or daughters started high school. The District’s baby boom is spiking not only in neighborhoods that have long attracted families, such as the suburban-like Upper Northwest or family-friendly Capitol Hill. Babies and toddlers are often seen on city streets near downtown neighborhoods such as Logan and Dupont circles. Places like Mount Pleasant and Columbia Heights are predominantly filled with young, single adults and have been responsible for most of the capital's growth over the past decade.","US Census Bureau figures show rise in infants under five being born .

We will one day be able to talk to animals using mobile phone-sized gadgets, says a leading expert in animal behaviour. Professor Con Slobodchikoff is developing new technology that interprets the calls of the prairie dog and says the technology could eventually be used to interpret other animals. He also suggested that the technology could . one day be fine-tuned to enable humans to talk back to animals and engage in conversation. Professor Con Slobodchikoff says that dogs may be able to express a preference for certain foods using the new technology. He also hopes that communicating with them may help treat behavioural problems . In an interview with The Atlantic, Professor Slobodchikoff explained he is using new artificial intelligence (AI) software to record the calls of prairie dogs. He is then using the AI techniques to analyse the barks and translate them into English. He explained that from his research, he knew that prairie dogs warn other members of the pack about potential dangers in great detail – even describing a threat as being a ‘thin, brown coyote approaching quickly’. The professor, who has spent the past 30 years analysing the behaviour of animals, added: ‘I think we have the technology now to be able to develop the devices that are, say, the size of a cellphone, that would allow us to talk to our dogs and cats. The film Dr Doolittle may become a reality in less than a decade thanks to new technology . ‘So the dog says ""bark!"" and the device analyses it and says, ""I want to eat chicken tonight."" 'Or the cat can say ""meow,"" and it can say, ""You haven't cleaned my litterbox recently"".' He estimated that it would take between five and ten years of extensive research to get to this point. If such technology became a reality, it would change the world, he explained: ‘Consider that, for example, 40 per cent of all households in America have dogs, 33 per cent have cats -- at least one cat, at least one dog. 'And consider that something like four million dogs are euthanised every year because of behavioural problems. 'Well, most problems are because of the lack of communication between animal and human. The human can't get across to the animal what the human expects, and the animal can't get across to the human what it's experiencing. 'And if we had a chance to talk back and forth, the dog could say, ""You're scaring me."" And you could say, ""Well, I'm sorry, I didn't realise that I was scaring you. I'll give you more space."" 'What I'm hoping, actually, is that down the road, we will be forming partnerships with animals, rather than exploiting animals.' He added that many people are afraid of animals or they have nothing to do with them because they don't think that animals have anything to contribute to their lives. He predicts that once people get to the point where they can start talking to animals, they'll realise that animals are living, breathing, thinking beings, and that they have much to contribute to people's lives.

The device was successful enough to be brought to the American market, and was even named one of 2002's best inventions by Time Magazine. But reports of the BowLingual's accuracy have been mixed with popular product-review website Epinions giving it a low 1.5 star average. In 2003 the same company launched a follow-up product for cats called Meowlingual although this was less successful.","Animal behaviour expert Professor Con Slobodchikoff is developing technology that can translate the complex calls of prairie dogs .

Joe Biden is under pressure after insisting that the U.S. consulate in Benghazi did not ask for additional security before it was attacked on September 11 - despite what diplomats and State Department officials have said. Paul Ryan spent much of last night's vice-presidential debate hitting out at the administration's handling of the Libya assault which killed ambassador Chris Stevens and four other Americans. The Vice President defended the government's handling of the crisis and denied that the State Department had turned down a request for security reinforcements in the months before the raid. The lively debate exchange came just hours after presidential candidate Mitt Romney launched his own denunciation of Barack Obama's response to the attack, saying the administration 'failed to grasp the seriousness of the challenges that we face'. Scroll down for video . Showdown: Joe Biden faced off against Republican vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan last night . Denial: Biden claimed that he didn't know U.S. officials in Benghazi had asked for additional security before the consulate attack, an apparent contradiction . Earlier this week, it was revealed that Stevens himself expressed concerns about security at the facility. Also, the head of a special operations team helping out with security asked for 'more, not less' reinforcements before the government pulled dozens from Libya earlier this year. But Biden, when asked about it by debate moderator Martha Raddatz, said: 'We weren't told they wanted more security there.' Ryan kept up his attack, saying: 'There were requests for extra security - those requests were not honoured.' He compared the situation in Libya with the heavily guarded American embassy in France as he insisted: 'Our ambassador in Paris has a Marine detachment . guarding him, shouldn't we have a Marine detachment guarding our ambassador in . Benghazi?' Clash: The pair disagreed over many aspects of how the administration handled the crisis . The Vice President attempted to deflect the blame for the security failures onto Republicans in Congress, saying that Ryan's fiscal plan 'cut embassy security in his budget by $300million below what we asked for.' The pair also sparred over another controversial issue connected to the Benghazi assault, as Biden again insisted that the administration initially believed the deadly raid was the result of protests over an anti-Muslim YouTube video which were sweeping the Islamic world at the time. 'The intelligence community told us that,' he said. 'As they learned . more facts about exactly what happened, they changed their assessment.' But Ryan replied: 'It took the President two weeks to acknowledge this was a terrorist . attack. He went to the UN and in his speech at the UN . six times talked about the YouTube video. 'Look, if we are hit by terrorists, we are going to call it for what it is: a terrorist attack.' Criticism: Mitt Romney also launched an attack on the President's handling of the deadly raid . Former presidential candidate Newt Gingrich predicted on Friday that Biden's uncompromising statements would 'haunt' the Obama campaign ahead of next month's election. 'Biden on Benghazi was so wrong last night, it’s going to haunt them from now until the next debate,' the former House speaker told CBS This Morning. Romney also launched a blistering assault on the Obama administration's treatment of the crisis as he spoke at a campaign rally in North Carolina. After an Obama official suggested that the tragedy had been politicised by Republicans, the GOP candidate responded: 'I think today we got another indication of how President Obama and his . campaign fail to grasp the seriousness of the challenges that we face . here in America.' He continued: 'Mr President, this is an issue because we were attacked successfully by terrorists on the anniversary of 9/11. 'President . Obama, this is an issue because Americans wonder why it was it took so . long for you and your administration to admit that this was a terrorist . attack.' Rage: A protester holding his rifle during the assault on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi on September 11th . Hours before the debate, two top . security officials who had been to the consulate testified on Capitol . Hill that they had made requests for more troops. Former regional security forces officer Eric Nordstrom and Lt Col Andrew Wood, who . was head of a Special Forces 'Site Security Team' in the country, . placed blame on Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Charlene Lamb for . rejecting their requests. 'The takeaway... for me and my staff, was abundantly clear - we were not . going to get resources until the aftermath of an incident,' Nordstrom . said. 'And the question that . we would ask is: how thin does the ice have to get before someone falls . through?' 'We were fighting a losing battle,' Wood added. 'We couldn't even keep what we had.' Lamb . and Patrick Kennedy, the undersecretary for management, testified that . they believed the security measures in place were enough. Attack: Four U.S. citizens died in the raid on the consulate in Benghazi, including Mr Stevens . On September 11, the day he died, Stevens wrote to Washington officials detailing a dispute involving the leaders of two prominent Benghazi militias who were responsible for security in the city, according to the Daily Beast. The two men, Wissam bin Ahmed and Muhammad al-Gharabi, claimed that the U.S. was lobbying for centrist politician Mahmoud Jibril to become Libya's prime minister. They said that if he won the vote, they 'would not continue to guarantee security in Benghazi, a critical function they asserted they were currently providing,' according to Stevens. Despite that warning, Stevens did not ask for more U.S. troops, and commented that Benghazi officials believed the city was becoming safer. The cable made no mention of a U.S.-made . YouTube video mocking the Prophet Muhammad which was originally thought . to have been the motivation for the deadly assault on the consulate . later that night. Pleas: Lt. Col. Andrew Wood said he asked for reinforcements in Libya but faced troop withdrawals instead . The American compound was being guarded . by members of the 'February 17 Martyrs Brigade', a militia which shared . members with the groups run by Mr bin Ahmed and Mr al-Gharabi. It was not only Stevens who saw potential security issues cropping up in Libya before the September 11 raid. Wood said officials felt 'like we were being asked to play the piano with two fingers' after a number of troops were withdrawn from Libya in August. He told CBS This Morning that worried embassy staff had approached him to ask if they would still be safe when his team had left. 'I could only answer that what we were being told is that they're working on it,' he said. He added: 'Shooting instances occurred, many instances involved the local security guard force that we were training. Aftermath: The U.S. consulate in Benghazi the day after last month's deadly assault . 'Constantly, . there were battles going on between militias, criminal activity and . that became an increasing danger as time went on as well.' Wood claimed that other senior officials, including Stevens, had requested a boost in the U.S. security presence, saying: 'We felt we needed more, not less.' Although his team was based in the city's capital Tripoli, Wood said he would have accompanied the ambassador to Benghazi had he still been in the country. State Department officials said that as the Site Security Team was intended to help re-open the embassy in Tripoli, their departure from Libya was irrelevant to the subsequent security situation. They also claimed that Wood did not know the details of the situation in Benghazi, which is 400 miles from the capital.

A toddler who was born deaf burst into tears and then grinned incredulously after an implant that allowed her to hear was turned on for the first time. Little Reyn Schadt, 16 months, was initially overwhelmed by the new sensation of sound, and flung herself into her mother's neck. But as her parents wept with joy, her panic turned to happiness as she realised she could hear for the very first time. Scroll down for video . Reyn Schadt, 16 months, was so overwhelmed when she heard for the first time that she burst into tears . And then the little girl beamed with delight as she realised she could hear the world around her for the first time . The adorable toddler from Louisville, Kentucky, was born with a virus called CMV (cytomegalovirus) which caused hearing loss. Her mother, Courtney Schadt, who said she was shocked to learn her baby daughter couldn't hear when she was born, was introduced to Shelly Moats, a Louisville audiologist, who said that a cochlear implant could help bypass the damaged nerve in Reyn's ears and allow her to hear. After the surgery, Reyn was invited to the doctor's practice to be fitted with the microphone and transmitter which would allow the implant to work. Then it was time for Dr Moats to turn the device on. As Reyn's parents sat nervously, Mrs Schadt with the little girl on her lap, Dr Moats turned the implant on via her computer. Reyn's eyes widened with surprise at the new sounds and vibration, and she turned to her mother in panic. But this was just the reaction the doctor and Reyn's parents had been hoping for, because it showed the little girl was hearing. Audiologist Shelly Moats prepares to turn the implant on while Reyn's mother Courtney looks tense . Life-changing device: Reyn wears the external part of her new implant on her ear and in her hair . As she adjusted to hearing for the first time, she grinned and then beamed with delight as she looked around her new, 3D world. Mrs Schadt told WDRB.com: 'It's a very, very exciting day for me because I've met children who have cochlear implants who are older than her and that has been the most exciting thing for me.' Two months later, the toddler's implants reported that the little girl had blossomed since the device had fitted, and that she now enjoyed singing songs and nursery rhymes with her mother. So happy: Reyn's parents say she has blossomed since having her implant fitted and now enjoys singing songs . Active toddler: Reyn, seen here playing in the park with her brother Charlie, can now live her life to the full . Mrs Schadt said: 'I feel like we've just made this huge journey where at the beginning I felt hopeless about it. 'Now her whole life is ahead of her without any limitation.' Dr Moats said the implant worked by sending electrical impulses to the brain that, with time, it would learn to interpret as sound. Around 30,000 children in the U.S. have had cochlear implants fitted, and around 220,000 people worldwide.

Residents of Maryville, Missouri say they’re now besieged by threats and in-fighting thanks to national media attention on the Daisy Coleman rape case. Townspeople fear they’re being cast as villains as the case of the new girl in town who accused two popular teens of rape—only to have the charges suddenly dropped—is being reopened. As the residents are forced to choose sides, news viewers across the country eager to create their own justice have even begun to threaten people related to the case using phone calls and the internet. Victim: Daisy Coleman accused Maryville, Missouri teens Matthew Barnett, 19, and Jordan Zech of raping her when she was 14 in January 2012, but the charges against them were dropped by prosecutors, some say suspiciously . Matthew Barnett, now 19, and Jordan Zech, were accused by then 14-year-old Daisy Coleman of rape after she and a friend went drinking with the boys in January 2012. In the months after the case was dropped because of an apparent lack of evidence, Daisy’s mother Melinda Coleman has been on a quest to get justice for her daughter. She and her family were new in town, and Barnett’s family had local political connections that some believed helped him and his buddy get off scot-free despite Daisy’s allegations she was given a ‘clear liquid’ that left her incapacitated before she was raped. Reopened: Charges against Matthew Barnett, left, and Jordan Zech will be revisited, but news of the circumstances under which they were dropped in March 2012 has the town of Maryville, Missouri taking sides and has the public eager for justice in the case of Daisy Coleman's rape accusations . ¿Your son is going to get a bullet through his head': The A&G restaurant in town has become the focus of threats from hacktivist group Anonymous, though the owners aren't associated with the accused rapists . And it all came to a head after the Kansas City Star published the Coleman’s story last weekend and Daisy’s story appeared on just about every internet news outlet. Many residents say it put them in an unfair light. ‘The worst thing to my wife and me is that we have this wonderful little town here and you (the media) have made us look like a bunch of scum,’ 83-year-old Mahlon Fairchild told this Kansas City Star. ‘It’s done a disservice to Maryville, a disservice to our legal system. We’re hurting. We’re hurting. It’s explosive.’ 'The media have made us look like a bunch of scum': National media scrutiny has many residents, even those who haven't chosen a side in the case, seething. It¿s done a disservice to Maryville,' said Mahlon Fairchild, 83 . Opening up: Paige Parkhurst Borland, seen here with her mother, was with Daisy on the night of the alleged rape. She said that the ordeal was 'very scary' The case has lit a fire under so called online ‘hacktivist’ group Anonymous, who’ve made threats to physically harm some residents and to destroy their property and livelihood. The owners of the A&G Greek restaurant in town say they get threatening phone calls every day, and though their son was attended the party where Daisy claims to have been assaulted, he was not implicated in the crime. ‘We got a phone call last night: “Your son is going to get a bullet through his head,”’ one of the owners said Saturday. Scrutiny: Daisy, at right with her mom Melinda, has graced covers and homepages of major media since news of her saga went national last weekend. The town of Maryville has also become the focus of intense scrutiny, much to its chagrin . Dig deep: Shirley Barnett, left, is the mother . of Matthew Barnett, 19, one of the high school footballers accused of . raping Daisy Coleman. She called on everybody to 'dig deeper to find the . truth' around the case and said her son is the real victim in the case threats on her son's safety pour into the tiny town . 'We¿re hurting. It¿s explosive': The home Daisy shared with her family was mysteriously burned after they left town. A threat to torch the Maryville high school has since come from a California Twitter user . Their business’s Yelp review page has been hit by Anonymous, too. ‘SO GENEROUS!’ read such post before administrators removed it. ‘Even once you’re stuffed, they keep bringing you food — almost like it’s against your will! When I told them to stop, they smiled and reassured me that I was asking for it.’ In a statement, Anonymous expressed their outright support of Daisy. 'We demand an immediate investigation into the handling by local authorities of (the victim’s) case. If Maryville won’t defend these young girls, if the police are too cowardly or corrupt to do their jobs, if the justice system has abandoned them, then we will have to stand for them. Mayor Jim Fall, your hands are dirty. Maryville, expect us.' Rumors: All parties involved with the alleged sexual assault attended Maryville High School. Rumors now abound about bomb threats being called into the school and its football field . Second chances: Though she and her family have fled Marylville, wedged in the center of the ongoing saga is Daisy Coleman. Her case, according to county prosecutors, will now be revisited . Nodaway County prosecuting attorney Robert L. Rice, who says neither politics nor connections played a role in his decision not to pursue the charges, has asked for a special prosecutor to reopen the felony case. Meanwhile, threats and division within the towns own ranks continue. Resident Tess Fornander, 46, fears what her 11-year-old daughter could be exposed to in the town. ‘I didn’t want her to even possibly hear anything about the girl being wrong,’ she told the Star. ‘Her house was burned down. She had to leave town. It’s just crazy.’ Indeed, the home where Daisy lived with her family was mysteriously burned after the family fled town. Perhaps to make a statement about the fire, a Twitter user in California posted declared he would burn down the high school. Murmuring about bomb threats have also fluttered through town, though they are unfounded. Barnett’s mother Shirley Barnett, who has staunchly defended her son, has called on the public leave the townspeople alone. 'There are universities in the state with children from Maryville and they are having to be walked to class because of threats made over the internet, threats that are being made to them. It’s getting worse and worse,’ Barnett told MailOnline last week. Former school superintendent Roland Tullberg said opinions of his town are worsening, too. ‘It makes Maryville, to people at a distance across the land, look like a community that doesn’t care about the individual. I want you to know that this community is a very fine community,’ he told the Star. ‘It makes people think we don’t care. We do care.’","The saga of Daisy Coleman and her accusations that two Maryville, Missouri schoolmates raped her last year has the sleepy town's residents waking up to threats from angry news watchers nationwide .

A Facebook post castigating Alaska Airlines for shoddy customer service toward an elderly man stricken with late-stage Parkinson's Disease has gone viral on the Web - and engendered a backlash against the company. Cameron Clark unwittingly incited the furor on Friday with a Facebook post labeling the Alaska Airlines personnel involved in the matter 'the worst of humanity.' The longtime Oregon concert promoter had witnessed Alaska Airlines workers repeatedly ignore an elderly, disabled man who was awaiting a flight at Oregon's Redmond Airport. 'The Worst of Humanity': Alaska Airlines faces a backlash from a Facebook post that went viral detailing poor customer service toward an elderly, disabled man . The man, who Clark said appeared to be in 70s, was flying to a long-awaited rendezvous with his daughter in Washington. He wound up missing the flight - even after Clark tried to intervene on his behalf. 'What happened to our . collective sense of decency, of compassion, of our disposition to help . those in need of extra help,' Clark later wrote in a post to his hundreds of Facebook friends. 'Alaska airlines. you broke a man's heart . today. you maintained your policy, and ignored an opportunity to do the . right thing. you broke my heart too.' KTVZ in Central Oregon reports Clark's dramatic account of the incident spread quickly on the Web, and sparked a series of angry Facebook posts directed at Alaska Airlines. Some posters urged the elderly man to sue the airline for violating the Americans with Disabilities Act. Others vowed never to fly with the carrier again until it did right by all those involved, the television station reported. For its part, the airline says employees did their best to accommodate the passenger. Officials posted on Facebook that the man's ticket was refunded, and he boarded a new flight Saturday morning. A spokesman said the man never said he was disabled and airline employees, smelling alcohol, believed he was intoxicated. 'What happened to our . collective sense of decency, of compassion, of our disposition to help . those in need of extra help. Alaska airlines. you broke a man's heart . today. you maintained your policy, and ignored an opportunity to do the . right thing. you broke my heart too. In his Facebook post, Clark said the man appeared to be in his 70s and told him that he missed a limited window of time he had to meet his daughter in Bellingham, Wash. Clark told KTVZ that he never intended for his post to become viral, but that the many people who responded to the story 'show(s) that the best of humanity is alive and well. that light exists. that accountability is possible.' The man never told airline employees that he had Parkinson's disease or any other disability, spokesman Paul McElroy reiterated to The Associated Press on Saturday. Officials believed he was intoxicated because they smelled alcohol. 'We are prohibited from asking customers if they have a disability, and the customer never told us that he had Parkinson's, or any disability for that matter,' McElroy said. 'He did appear disoriented to us, and later, when we smelled alcohol, we were led to the conclusion he was intoxicated.' A terrible illness: The Facebook post that went viral concerned a man who - like Michael J. Fox (left) and Muhammad Ali (right) - suffers from Parkinson's Disease, a degenerative illness affecting the central nervous system . 'We don't know whether this customer has . Parkinson's or not,' said McElroy, who added that the passenger has not . complained to the airline over the incident. After hearing of the airline's response, Clark said he was troubled. 'I was closer to him than any of their employees,' he told KTVZ in a written statement after the fact. 'I stood right next to him for fifteen minutes, and we spoke to each other within inches of each other. I smelled absolutely nothing. 'It's unreal what they are doing now.'.","Post's author says Oregon airport workers ignored elderly man with late-stage Parkinson's Disease .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 03:08 EST, 21 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:27 EST, 21 October 2013 . A fire which broke out in the home of a missing teenager may have been arson, police believe. Detectives probing the suspicious blaze at the home of Erica Parsons, in Salisbury, North Carolina, suspect a microwave may have been sabotaged to explode into flames. Erica Parsons has not been seen since she left the home of her parents Casey and Sandy Parsons, who adopted her - their niece - in November 2011. Where is she? Erica's brother said he last saw her in November 2011 when he reported her missing on July 30 . The case of missing Erica has gripped a nation after her adoptive parents claimed she was living with her grandmother, 'Nan', only for her biological mother to insist no such person exists. Now in a new twist, investigators returned to the house on Miller Chapel Road, from which Mr and Mrs Parsons had recently been evicted, to carry out further tests. The fire started on Wednesday, last week, when owner William Parsons turned the power back on after carrying out an extensive refurbishment to the property. Speaking out: Sandy (left) and Casey Parsons spoke to Dr Phil about their missing daughter Erica, who they say is living with her grandmother - even though they have not heard from her for 18 months . Anger: The Parsons say they left her with 'Nan' as she was happier there and did not want to see them . Suspicions over the fire have now fallen on an unnamed family member, who was allegedly heard boasting of being able to start a house fire with a microwave. No one has been arrested or charged in the fire, or is even considered a suspect. William Parsons told WCNC.com: 'I heard some cracking and went back up in the house, and the microwave was on fire,' 1998: Erica Lynn Parsons, age 2 weeks, is taken in by Casey and Sandy Parsons, who have three children of their own. She is the biological child of Sandy Parsons’ brother’s wife. 2000: The Parsonses officially adopt Erica in Cabarrus County . 1999-2011: The couple have two more children, Brooke and Toby. February 2010: William James Parsons, 16, the couple’s biological son, is arrested for biting his younger brother. August 2011: James Parsons is charged with two counts of assault, animal cruelty and assault on a minor. Charges are dismissed when Casey Parsons does not appear in court. Nov. 19, 2011: The Parsonses take Erica to a McDonald’s in Mooresville to catch a ride to the Asheville home of her biological grandmother, Irene 'Nan' Goodman. December 2011: The Parsonses say on her third visit to Asheville, Erica calls home and says she doesn’t want to live with them anymore. 2012: Casey Parsons files a missing persons report for her daughter, Brooke. July 30, 2013: After his parents kick him out, James Parsons contacts the Rowan County Sheriff’s Office and reports that Erica has been missing for two years. August 2013: After undergoing two days of questioning by investigators, the Parsonses hire attorney Carlyle Sherrill. Aug. 5, 2013: The Rowan Sheriff’s Office issues a missing/endangered persons alert for Erica. He believes it was an accident. Investigators confirmed the second set of tests were in order to be able to rule sabotage in or out. Casey Parsons says the family had electrical problems caused by the microwave several times before. Erica's adoptive parents insisted they were not worried about her safety because they believed she was with 'Nan' - even though it later emerged that both of Erica's biological grandmothers were in fact dead. The missing teen's biological mother Carolyn Parsons has spoken out against the couple's claims, saying she will not give up looking for her daughter, who is now 15. 'I'm in somebody's nightmare and they will not wake up and let me out,' she previously told WBTV. Casey and Sandy's lawyer, Carlyle Sherrill, said that it was Carolyn who introduced Erica to 'Nan', adding: 'That's who brought Nan to them and probably knows who Nan is.' But Carolyn said: 'Nan and Irene don't exist. The only two people that know the truth are the only two people that won't give the truth.' She also said she had not wanted to hand her daughter over to her in-laws, but felt she had to because she was unable to bring up the child properly. 'No mother wants to have children and just give them up,' she said. 'I didn't want to. She didn't deserve the life that I had.' Carolyn says she has not seen Erica since January 2011, 10 months before she went missing. A polygraph test carried out on Sandy Parsons was found to be 'strongly deceptive' when he described how he had nothing to do with her disappearance. Sandy and his wife Casey appeared on Dr Phil's show two weeks ago to defend themselves against claims they murdered and abused adoptive their daughter. Investigators are hunting for information about the whereabouts and the disappearance of Erica.","Erica Parsons vanished in 2011 and was reported missing in August .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . PUBLISHED: . 08:30 EST, 21 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:34 EST, 21 October 2013 . Divorce battle: Former City trader Yan Assoun (above) outside London's appeal court where he claimed he was 'bust' despite being a major shareholder of £5m-a-year business . A former City trader locked in a bitter divorce battle today told a judge that he was not 'rich' despite being a major shareholder of a £5million-a-year business and owning a £2million apartment. Yan Assoun, 43 - whose spending power was described by a family judge just three months ago as 'beyond the wildest dreams' of his estranged wife - insisted in London's Appeal Court that he was 'bust'. Mr Assoun, who is believed to be French, said he was labouring under enormous debts, adding: 'Yes I own a $3.3m (£2million) apartment - it doesn’t mean I'm rich.' Mr Assoun and his ex-wife Anais Assoun, 44, met and married in London while he worked in the City for BNP Paribas and Credit Suisse. They raised their two children - Graysha, now a model, and Kai - in the capital before splitting in 2007 and departing for different parts of the US in 2009. However Mrs Assoun, a fashion writer who owns a ranch in Texas, and her ex-husband, whose home is a $3.3million (£2million) condo in one of New York’s most iconic areas, turned to the English courts to decide how the family wealth should be divided. Mr Assoun told Lord Justice Moses that despite his ex-wife being awarded $1.1m worth of assets in 2011 - in addition to him being ordered to pay her $180,000-a-year in maintenance, plus $50,000-a-year to pay for their children’s education - the financial battle between the couple is far from over. A final court show-down to assess and divide their wealth is pending and, in July, Judge Glenn Brasse ordered that Mr Assoun pay £235,000 towards his ex-wife’s legal costs bills in the run-up to that hearing. The banker asked Lord Justice Moses to overturn that order, telling him: 'My recent income has dropped considerably - I don’t have any money.' Judge Brasse, sitting at the Clerkenwell and Shoreditch County Court in July, awarded the payment towards the wife’s costs, after ruling on a dispute between the former spouses over the amount of personal wealth each of them controls. Protracted dispute: Mr Assoun's ex-wife Anais Assoun, right, with their model daughter Graysha . In his ruling, the judge said of Mr Assoun: 'The husband has been able to acquire a $3.3m apartment in Manhattan. This kind of spending ability is not within the wife’s reach, not within her wildest dreams.' Of Mrs Assoun, he added: 'She is a well-educated woman, with a first and masters degree and journalistic experience,' going on to say that her earning capacity was far outweighed by that of her husband. Mr Assoun, representing himself, told the Appeal Court: 'Judge Brasse ordered me to pay large sums in legal fees to my wife...(he was) wrong to make such an order'. Of his multi-million dollar business he added: 'Speculation that a turnover of $8m would automatically translate to a large income for myself, because I own 50% of the company, is just wrong. 'He is making a mistake... I am currently acting in person because my recent income has dropped considerably. I can no longer afford a solicitor...what is in the past is almost irrelevant.' Mrs Assoun was awarded $1.1m worth of assets in 2011 in addition to $180,000-a-year in maintenance plus $50,000-a-year for their children's education . Putting a question to Mr Assoun on the current state of his business, Lord Justice Moses asked: 'Did your barrister say it’s all gone bust?' 'Yes he did,' the banker replied, adding: 'The house has no equity - the house belongs to the banks. I own an apartment worth $3.3m - it doesn’t mean I’m rich.' Insisting that the £235,000 costs payment was effectively an 'increase in maintenance' for his ex-wife, he concluded: 'The point is, I don’t have this money.' 'It is far above my income. I don’t have any capacity for borrowing. I already have a huge amount of debt. I don’t have any money.'

President Barack Obama will declare the glitches in a new healthcare website 'unacceptable' on Monday as his team scrambles to fix problems that have tainted the roll-out of his signature healthcare law. Fresh from two weeks of budget battles that have consumed Washington, Obama will hold an event at 11:25am in the White House Rose Garden with consumers, small business owners, and pharmacists who have been affected by the new law. The move is the highest-profile step in a broad damage control effort that the administration has launched since technical problems with the website, healthcare.gov, have prevented Americans nationwide from signing up for a program that will largely define Obama's domestic policy legacy. Issues: The new Obamacare website, Healthcare.gov, is not working the way it should. The government admits it needs to be fixed as it is causing 'frustration' 'The president will directly . address the technical problems with HealthCare.gov - troubles that he . and his team find unacceptable - and discuss the actions he has pushed . for to make it easier for consumers to comparison shop and enroll for . insurance while work continues around the clock to improve the website,' a White House official said on Sunday.

A team of archaeologists have discovered the fossilised remains of a 72 million-year-old dinosaur tail in a desert in northern Mexico, it has been announced. The 'unusually well-preserved' five yard-long tail was the first ever found in Mexico, said Francisco Aguilar, director of the country's National Institute for Anthropology and History. The team, made up of archaeologists and students from INAH and the National Autonomous University of Mexico, identified the fossil as a hadrosaur, or duck-billed dinosaur. Relic: The researchers found the ancient dinosaur tail in Coahuila State in Mexico . The 'unusually well-preserved' five yard-long tail was the first ever found in Mexico. It is 72 million years old . The tail, found near the small town of General Cepeda found in the border state of Coahuila, likely made up half the dinosaur's length, Aguilar said. Archaeologists found the 50 vertebrae of the tail completely intact after spending 20 days in the desert slowly lifting a sedimentary rock covering the creature's bones. Strewn around the tail were other fossilised bones, including one of the dinosaur's hips, INAH said. Precision: Archaeologists painstakingly excavate the tail . Speaker for the dead: The tail, from a hadrosaur, will enable experts to learn about bone conditions that affected the colossal beasts . Despite Mexico's rich heritage in paleontology, this is the first dinosaur tail found in the country . Strewn around the tail were other fossilised bones, including one of the dinosaur's hips . The hadrosaurs are known as the duck-billed dinosaurs due to the similarity of their head to that of modern ducks. The whole front of the skull was flat and broadened out to form a beak, which was ideal for clipping leaves and twigs from the forests of Asia, Europe and North America. However, the back of the mouth contained thousands of teeth suitable for grinding food before it was swallowed. Hadrosaurs likely grazed on horsetails and vegetation close to the ground, rather than browsing higher-growing leaves and twigs. Dinosaur tail finds are relatively rare, . according to INAH. The new discovery could further understanding of the . hadrosaur family and aid research on diseases that afflicted dinosaur . bones, which resembled those of humans, Aguilar said. Scientists have already determined that dinosaurs suffered from tumors and arthritis, for example. Dinosaur remains have been found in many parts of the state of Coahuila, in addition to Mexico's other northern desert states. 'We have a very rich history of paleontology,' Aguilar said. He noted that during the Cretaceous period, which ended about 65 million years ago, much of what is now central northern Mexico was on the coast. This has enabled researchers to unearth remains of both marine and land-based dinosaurs. The presence of the remains was reported to INAH by locals in June 2012. After initial inspections, excavation began earlier this month. The remains of the tail will be transferred to General Cepeda for cleaning and further investigation. An artist rendering provided by the National Geographic Society shows what a hadrosaur is believed to have looked like .","The 'unusually well-preserved' tail is the first-ever found in Mexico .

The stepmother of one of the two girls accused of cyber-bullying a 12-year-old to suicide was ordered this weekend to stay away from her children after a video emerged of her joining in on two young boys fighting. Vivian Vosburg, 30, of Lakeland, FL., was arrested after a video of her punching two fighting children and screaming profanities allegedly emerged on Facebook, she has now been told to stay away. Ms Vosburg is the stepmother of 14-year-old cyber-bullying suspect Guadalupe Shaw. Shaw and Katelyn Roman, 12, have been accused by officials of cyber-bullying Rebecca Sedwick, 12, to the point she committed suicide by jumping from a tower at a concrete plant. Scroll down for video . Stay away: A Florida judge has told Vivian Vosburg she is not allowed contact with her children . Appearing this . weekend in front of a Polk County judge, Ms Vosburg was charged with two . counts of child abuse with bodily harm and four counts of child . neglect, according to the Polk County Sheriff's Office. 'The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.' Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said during a Friday afternoon news conference. Ms Vosburg, when shown the disturbing video, admitted she may have taken things too far that day, sheriff Judd said. Still in custody, her bail was set at $300,000, according to records. This is Ms Vosburg's second run-in with the law over assault charges. Records . show that in 2002 the troubled woman was charged with battery during a . routine traffic stop for a non-moving violation. Those charges were . dropped as a result of her victim not wanting to pursue charges, a . sheriff's office spokesperson told MailOnline. Mother of the year: Vivian Vosburg, mother of accused cyber-bullier Guadalupe Shaw, is brought in to the Polk County Jail Booking area after being arrested for punching two fighting juveniles . Accused: Katelyn Roman, 12, left, and Guadalupe Shaw, 14, right, were arrested and charged with aggravated stalking in connection with the death of Rebecca Sedwick . Booked: Ms Vosburg is currently sitting in Polk County Jail . 'The video was of two juvenile subjects fighting, an adult female punching the fighting juveniles and screaming profanities,' said a sheriff's office affidavit. There were 'several other juveniles shouting profanities and moving around in what appears to be a bedroom of a residence.' Six minors between the ages of nine and 14-years-old were also seen in the video, the affidavit said. Ms Vosburg has access to all of the children seen in the video, the affidavit continued. The children fighting in the video are two boys, but several other children are watching the fight. The video was posted to Facebook in July and was visible as recently as Friday morning, the affidavit noted. 'It is clear, not only has Vosburg demonstrated she cannot control the behavior of children she has access to without using violence, but she is obviously not monitoring the social media sites of children she has access to either,' said Sheriff Grady Judd. Ms Vosburg has claimed in media interviews that Ms Shaw is her daughter, but she is apparently the teen's stepmother. 'She says she is the mother, but we are finding out the relationship is different,' Polk County spokesperson Donna Wood told MailOnline. It is not clear where the troubled teens biological mother is, nor is it known how long Ms Vosburg has been with the girl's father. Ms Vosburg's daughter was arrested for cyber-stalking after allegedly posting a heartless Facebook post mocking the dead girl's suicide leap. 'Yes IK [I know] I bullied REBECCA nd [sic] she killed her self but IDGAF [I don't give a f***],' Ms Shaw allegedly posted . Rebecca was 'terrorized' by . as many as 15 girls who ganged up on her and picked on her for months . through online message boards and texts. She jumped to her death from a tower at an abandoned concrete plant on September 10. Judd said they decided to arrest Shaw after she posted the message on Saturday. 'We decided that we can't leave her out there. Who else is she going to torment, who else is she going to harass?' he said. Roman was Rebecca's former best friend, but Judd said the . 14-year-old turned her against Rebecca. Other girls also stopped . being friends with her in fear of being bullied, the sheriff said. Missed: Rebecca Sedwick took her own life after being relentlessly bullied . 'Several students corroborated stories of both girls bullying Sedwick on . different occasions, through name-calling, intimidation, threats to beat . her up, and at least one actual physical fight,' the sheriff said today. He warned parents in a news conference today: 'Watch what your children do online. Pay attention to what your kids are doing. Quit being their best friend and be their best parent.' Roman and Shaw were . arrested on Monday night and detained at the county's juvenile center . before being released to their parents, the Orlando Sentinel reports. They were charged with felony aggravated stalking. It is believed the bullying started when Shaw started dating Rebecca's ex-boyfriend. Witnesses told investigators she sent messages to Rebecca, calling her ugly, telling her to 'drink bleach and die', and encouraging her to kill herself. Sedwick's computer searches revealed she had searched for ways to commit suicide and asked questions like, 'What is overweight for a 13-year-old girl' . One of the Florida girl's screensavers also showed Rebecca with her head resting on a railroad track. She changed one of her online screen names to 'That Dead Girl.' She messaged a boy: 'I'm jumping.' Devastated: Rebecca Ann Sedwick, 12, pictured with her mother Tricia Norman, is believed to have jumped from an abandoned cement silo . Tragic loss: Rebecca with her sister Amy . Aftermath: Rebecca's sister Summer (left) and a friend sign a poster after her death. Two people have now been arrested in connection with the bullying . Polk County Sheriff Judd said Rebecca had been 'absolutely terrorized' by the other girls. 'We can see from what we've been investigating so far that Rebecca wasn't attacking back,' Judd said. 'She . appeared to be beat down. She appeared to have a defeatist attitude. And quite frankly, the entire investigation is exceptionally . disturbing.' Even when her mother took Rebecca out of school, the bullying was carried out online. The bullying started . over a boy last year at Crystal Lake Middle School and at one point she . was suspended for fighting with another student - believed to be Roman. Last December, . Rebecca was hospitalized for three days after cutting her wrists because . of what she said was bullying, according to the sheriff. 'When . she was being bullied at Crystal Lake Middle, she used to come home . every day and tell me how she wasn’t worth anything, that she was ugly, . how she was stupid,' her mother Tricia Norman said after her death. 'And . I said, ''Baby what on earth would make you think that? You’re the most . beautiful person I know and the smartest person I know.''' Bullied: Rebecca was withdrawn from her . elementary school after being bullied and was home schooled by her mother Tricia (right) who says her daughter's death should be a warning to all parents to be vigilant . Tributes: Flowers, candles and messages are left out in memory of 12-year-old Rebecca . Later, after Rebecca . complained that she had been pushed in the hallway and that another girl . wanted to fight her, Rebecca's mother began home-schooling her, Judd . said. This fall, Rebecca . started at a new school, Lawton Chiles Middle Academy, and loved it, . Judd said. But the bullying continued online. 'She put on a perfect, happy face. She never told me,' Tricia Norman told the Lakeland Ledger. 'I never had a clue. I mean, she told me last year when she was being bullied, but not this year, and I have no idea why.' Once . police checked her cell phone they discovered that the bullying had not . stopped, especially on Kik Messenger, Instagram and Ask.fm. 'They would tell her she's ugly, stupid, nobody liked her go kill herself,"" Ms Norman said. She has started a Facebook page to try to fight back against online bullies, called Rebecca Sedwick Against Bullying. Ms Norman told 10 News she was inspired to start it after reading her daughter's journal. In . it, Rebecca had written: 'Every day more and more kids kill themselves . because of bullying. How many lives have to be lost until people realize . words do matter?' Ms Norman . wants online bullies to face harsher consequences, and begged other . young victims to stay strong and seek help, adding: 'Don't ever give up, . like Becca did.'","Vivian Vosburg, 30, the stepmother of Guadalupe Shaw, 14, has been charged with child abuse and neglect .

Guilty: Caroline Butler made numerous fraudulent housing, council tax, employment support and income support claims over a two-year period . A benefit cheat who stole nearly £18,000 from the taxpayer tried to hide her relationship with the father of her children from investigators by pretending to be a lesbian. Caroline Butler made numerous fraudulent housing, council tax, employment support and income support claims over a two-year period, a court has heard. When fraud investigators probed into the scam, the 42-year-old denied being in a relationship with Andrew Donaldson - the father of her three children - claiming she was only interested in women. Butler told magistrates she had only known her employed partner for five years before moving into her home in Rochdale, Greater Manchester. However, she revised this to 15 years after investigators from Rochdale Council and the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) produced her eldest child’s birth certificate, which named Mr Donaldson as the father. But the mother-of-three still denied their relationship - claiming she was a lesbian and Mr Donaldson was not the child's biological father. She said her children, aged nine to 13, all had different dads and the 56-year-old was just a 'friend'. Butler then stormed out of a second interview with investigators after admitting he had been living with her for six months, Manchester City Magistrates Court heard. False claims: The 42-year-old told Manchester City Magistrates' Court (pictured) she had only known her employed partner Andrew Donaldson for five years before moving into her home in Rochdale, Greater Manchester . She was arrested and charged with fraud offences by failing to inform the DWP that she was living with Mr Donaldson as ‘husband and wife’ - meaning he could have financially supported her. Butler, of Chatburn Avenue, Castleton, denied four counts of dishonesty under the Fraud Act. However, magistrates found her guilty of fraudulently claiming benefits totalling £17,990 between 2010 and 2012. She was ordered to repay the full amount, in addition to £400 costs and a £60 victim surcharge. She was also handed a 12-month community order, with 225 hours of unpaid work. Councillor Farooq Ahmed, Rochdale Council’s . cabinet member for finance, said: 'It is saddening to hear about the . lengths some people go to when attempting to support fraudulent claims.' Speaking about the council following the hearing, Butler said: 'They don’t know me. They don’t know nothing about me. 'They’ve carried on sending me letters. They better stop harassing me or I’ll report them.' Unbelievably, she claimed the authority owed her cash from 2006 after the 'damp' council house she previously lived in ‘ruined’ her belongings and left her ill. In a previous interview, she said: 'I’ve still not had any compensation from them after all I went through.

Mrs Arnold, 75, has lived in her terraced house on the road for more than 50 years, and says in the 1960s the alley was well-kept. But as the decades dragged on residents began to dump their rubbish on the cobbles, regardless of whether it was collection day or not. The result was a ‘grubby’ and ‘dirty’ back alley which was unsafe for children and a magnet for anti-social behaviour and crime.

She said: ‘I just started thinking about how lovely the alley could be. For years it had been the place where people dumped their rubbish.

Battle: Campaigners have not been able to raise money to preserve the reservoir and have failed in applications for it to be made a listed building . Last chance: Developers Kingswood Homes have opened up the reservoir for guided tours so that members of the public can see the site before it disappears . Developers are currently holding guided tours of the reservoir at Clayton-le-Woods near Accrington, Lancashire, so that enthusiasts can marvel at its history before it disappears forever. Historian Boyd Harris,who has written a commemorative booklet on the reservoir, described its hauntingly beautiful tunnels as 'like being in the hall of the mountain king'. He said: 'This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and I’m sure people will be interested in a unique underground experience and say goodbye to the reservoir which began supplying pure drinking water to the community in 1884. Hauntingly beautiful: Historian Boyd Harris described the reservoir's tunnels as 'like being in the hall of the mountain king' Shielded from view: The entrance to the reservoir. When work at the site began a special ceremony was held to lay the foundation stone but there was little above ground to show that it even existed . Industrial: The reservoir originally used a steam pump to lift water from a large diameter well, approximately 25 meters deep, and pumped it into the reservoir where it fed drinking water to Leyland through a cast iron pipe . Unknown quantity: Until now few people have stepped inside the reservoir, which was decommissioned 21 years ago . 'Few people have seen inside. I’m just one of the lucky few.' When the underground reservoir was built, a new 14 mile pipeline was laid to Wheelton and a connection was taken from the Thirlmere Aqueduct.In 1883, a special ceremony was held to lay the foundation stone and there was little above ground to show that it even existed. The reservoir originally used a steam pump to lift water from a large diameter well, approximately 25 meters deep, and pumped it into the reservoir where it then fed drinking water to Leyland through a cast iron waterpipe. Subsequently a much deeper bore hole was sunk below the bottom of the well, and a submersible electric pump used to extract water - making the steam pump redundant. The bore hole was used occasionally as an emergency backup and to prevent the brickwork from drying out. Enterprise: When the underground reservoir was built in 1884, a new 14 mile pipeline was laid to Wheelton and a connection was taken from the Thirlmere Aqueduct . Unique: Chorley Historical and Archaeological Society tried unsuccessfully to save parts of the reservoir and said that the site was a 'unique piece of our heritage' A look at history: Developer Kingswood Homes has agreed to open a side wall to allow the public inside to view the Victorian reservoir ahead of its demolition . Despite its history English Heritage has twice refused an application for the reservoir to be made a listed building. The body, which advises of the care of historical sites, said it does not fulfil the criteria for national recognition as it is 'neither a rare nor an exceptional example of its type'. Chorley Historical and Archaeological Society tried unsuccessfully to save parts of the reservoir for posterity. The society said that as a piece of industrial archaeology, the site was a 'unique piece of our heritage as it is the oldest and last surviving example of a brick vaulted underground reservoir construction in the area'. Previously owned by United Utilities, the reservior was sold at auction in March. Historical: The Back Lane reservoir is said to be the oldest and last surviving example of a brick vaulted underground reservoir construction in Chorley . Local importance: Paul Jones from Kingswood Homes said it was important to give people the opportunity to come and have a look at the reservoir's archaeology . Drying out: Despite its history English Heritage has twice refused an application for the reservoir to be made a listed building . Now developer Kingswood Homes has agreed to open a side wall to allow the public inside to view the Victorian reservoir ahead of its demolition. Rosemary Boyd, a member of the Chorley Historical and Archaeological Society, said: 'At first we were very disappointed because we couldn’t get the funding, but we’re very pleased it’s being made available for the community to see, especially the children.' Paul Jones, from developers Kingswood Homes, said it would be open for guided tours for two weeks. He said: 'We felt it was important to open it to the local community to give them the opportunity to come and have a look at the archaeology and the history.' A spokesman for Kingswood Homes added: 'Kingswood Homes have been working closely with the local archaeological society to develop a commercially viable option to retain the reservoir at Clayton-le-Woods. 'Due to a lack of funding this was unfortunately unsuccessful. Before any redevelopment Kingswood Homes would like to open the reservoir to the local community and schools to give people the opportunity to view it and appreciate the Victorian architecture.' Past times: In its heyday the Back Lane reservoir stored up to 300,000 gallons of water and by the time it was decommissioned in 1992 was one of last surviving examples of its type of construction .

A newly crowned Miss France beauty queen has become embroiled in accusations of racism and a catfight between previous winners just days into her reign. The Representative Council of Black Associations (CRAN) denounced medical student Marine Lorphelin, 19, for being 'as white as snow' and criticised the lack of black and Arab contestants. The organisation labelled the contest outdated and an insult to the country's ethnic diversity - but the attack has prompted an angry backlash from Miss Lorphelin's supporters. Winner: Newly-crowned Miss France Marine Lorphelin, 19, has become embroiled in a racism row . CRAN president Louis-Georges Tin said in a statement jointly issued by Miss Black France creator, Fred Royer: 'The failure to represent the contemporary French population in an event such as this is obviously serious. 'It amounts to denying the very existence of French people of African origin.' But Didier Maisto, editor of Lyon Capitale, a website based in Miss Lorphelin's home region of Burgundy, told The Times: 'These types of comments, which are violently anti-Republican, seek to set French people against each other.' Beauty: Miss Lorphelin beams with pride alongside jury president Alain Delon and Miss France MD Sylvie Tellier . The victory was followed days later by a mixed-race contestant, Auline Grac, 21, winning the dissident competition Miss Prestige. Miss Lorphelin was due to appear on the Faut Pas Rater Ca talk show on public television station France 4 to be interviewed by Elodie Gossuin - who won Miss France last year and is a supporter of  Miss Prestige. But Miss France Company managing director, Sylvie Tellier, who won the pageant in 2002, refused to allow Miss Lorphelin to be interviewed by her bitter rival. Television executives gave in and sent Miss Gossuin home despite accusations they had failed to defend editorial independence. Crowning glory: Miss Lorphelin looked stunning as she appeared on Canal Plus' Le Grand Journal programme . Miss Lorpehlin was instead interviewed by presenter Isabelle Morini-Bosc, who asked her guest about a small scar on her nose. She replied: 'You noticed it. It was plastic surgery. I had a little crust on my nose when I was adolescent and it wasn't very beautiful.' Miss Lorphelin saw off competition from 32 other finalist - eight from ethnic minorities and six of those from France's Pacific and Caribbean territories - to win the crown last weekend. Criticised: Ethnic minority groups have denounced Miss Lorphelin for being 'as white as snow' The CRAN statement added: 'In the antiquated world of . Miss France, blacks apparently can only come from overseas departments. 'As for Frenchwomen of north African heritage, they were 'represented' by only one candidate who was quickly eliminated (too Muslim perhaps?).

A savage wildfire is burning its way through the popular Idaho mountain resort community of Sun Valley today and has forced the evacuation of some 1,600 houses in the area where Arnold Schwarzenegger, Tom Hanks and Bruce Willis have second homes. The evacuation orders for the 100-square-mile Beaver Creek Fire included homes in drainages and foothills west of the towns of Hailey and extending to north of Ketchum in central Idaho. More than 600 state and federal firefighters were working to get the blaze under control and protect property in the affluent resort region. Another 1,000 firefighters were expected to report to the scene on Friday night, said Shawna Hartman, spokeswoman for the Beaver Creek Fire Department. Scroll down for video . Flames: A woman watches as flames blaze down a ridge as the Beaver Creek wildfire rages outside Hailey on August 16, 2013 . Dangerous: The fire is raging near the Sun Valley ski resort in Idaho, where some 1,600 homes have been evacuated as flames menaced multimillion-dollar homes in the area, authorities said . Firefighters: Fire crews attend a planning meeting for the Beaver Creek wildfire outside Hailey, Idaho August 16, 2013 . Fire managers say the fire grew rapidly on Friday thanks to wind gusts topping out at 30 mph, low humidity and tinder-dry ground fuels. 'It's safe to say we've got a lot of structures at risk,' Hartman said. Managers at the Sun Valley Ski Resort turned on water cannons that are normally used for wintertime snowmaking. One home in an outlying valley was destroyed Thursday night, said Bronwyn Nickel, a spokeswoman for Blaine County, where the fire is burning. In addition, some private insurers have sent in their own crews to provide structural protection for homes with values that can stretch into the millions of dollars, Nickel said. 'There are private engines that insurance companies have sent in,' she said. 'They're on site, they're working with our local firefighters and law enforcement.' Fire officials said crews spent the day building fire lines and trying to funnel the fire into areas burned during another blaze in 2007. A huge DC-10 tanker, capable of carrying 12,000 gallons of retardant, was among aircraft making drops on the blaze.

Luxury: The luxury Sun Valley home of Bruce Willis, pictured, is also in the area where the fire is raging . Jack Sibbach, a Sun Valley Resort spokesman, had to leave his home south of Ketchum on Friday. He said he watched as airplanes and helicopters made runs in roughly 3-minute intervals, dropping water and red retardant to create a barrier against flames west of U.S. Highway 75. The resort turned on snow cannons on Bald Mountain, he said, largely to protect lodges atop the mountain, should the fire advance that far. 'The fire's not that close to Baldy, but with the wind, you're worrying about things sparking,' Sibbach said. 'Things could jump ahead.' Flying in separate aircraft, Gov. C.L. 'Butch' Otter and U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell took an aerial tour of the fire. The towns of Ketchum, with a population of 2,700, and Sun Valley, with 1,400 people, were under pre-evacuation orders, with residents advised to prepare their belongings in case they were required to leave on a moment's notice. Fire managers 'are just adding an extra layer of caution to the plan that they started last night,' said Rudy Evenson, a spokesman for the federal team overseeing the blaze.

Traffic was 'bumper to bumper,' Hailey resident Jane McCann told The Associated Press by phone Friday. 'The smoke is unbearable,' said McCann, who was in her car. 'Today in Hailey, you couldn't see the mountains from Main Street.' Elsewhere in the western United States, shifting winds in Utah's Skull Valley pushed another wildfire across Utah Highway 99 toward the community of Terra, about 50 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, forcing the evacuation of several homes and a campground. Exactly how many homes were evacuated wasn't known Friday, fire official Joanna Wilson said. The fire was 20 percent contained. Calmer winds to the northwest allowed some evacuation orders to be lifted near a Utah mountain ski resort town, where a wildfire was about half-contained after burning seven homes earlier in the week. However, about 110 homes located about 10 miles from the 2002 Olympic venue of Park City remained off-limits to their residents, as crews mopped up hot spots.

And let us hope this young art lover had a good, long look. Last night there were fears that Constable’s masterpiece The Lock could disappear forever from public view after it was sold to a private buyer for £22.4million. Scroll down for video . Beauty of a bygone age: A Christie's employee gazes at The Lock by English artist John Constable as it went up for auction yesterday . Too expensive for British museums: There are fears the landscape may never be seen in public again after it was bought by a private buyer for £22.4million . Experts had warned that cash-strapped British museums and galleries were unlikely to pay up to save it for the nation when it was auctioned at Christie’s in London. And with no obligation for the new owner to keep it on display, it may be the last time we have the chance to see for ourselves the genius of each brush stroke. The landscape, part of a succession Constable nicknamed ‘the six-footers’, and one of his favourites, was up for auction for only the second time in its history. Back in 1824, MP James Morrison paid 150 guineas for it, the equivalent of around £20,000 today. Keeping it quiet: Bidders on phones try to stay discreet. The painting went to an anonymous bidder after taking two minutes to reach its final price . Then in 1990 it was sold for £10.8million to Dutch-born billionaire Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza and his wife Carmen ‘Tita’ Thyssen, a former Miss Spain. That was a record for a British work of art and it was not surpassed until 2006, when a view of Venice by Constable’s rival JMW Turner was bought for £20.5million. Three months ago Edvard Munch’s iconic masterpiece The Scream became the most expensive work of art to be sold at auction, for the dollar equivalent of £74million. Last night at Christie’s, The Lock took only two minutes to reach its comparatively modest price and was bought by an anonymous telephone bidder. The sale is a joint record for an Old Master at Christie’s, making the Lock one of the most expensive British paintings ever sold. Quintessentially English: The Lock, like another of his great works, The Hay Wain (pictured), epitomises Constable's lifelong love of Suffolk and was the fifth of six landscapes he painted of the Stour Valley . Although its original price tag has multiplied nearly 140,000 times since it was first sold at the Royal Academy, counting on it for a massive return on the 1990 price was a gamble. Some experts calculated that it has actually lost value in real terms over the last 22 years. The Lock, like another of his great works, The Hay Wain, epitomises Constable’s lifelong love of the Suffolk countryside. The Lock was the fifth of six landscapes he painted of the Stour Valley. It depicts a figure struggling to open a canal gate at Dedham Lock near Flatford Mill to allow a barge to pass. After it was sold in 1990 to the Thyssen-Bornemisza family it had been housed in Madrid’s Bornemisza Museum. Last night art expert Godfrey Barker confirmed the painting had probably gone to a UK private buyer. ‘Constable does not cross borders,’ he said. ‘A sunbaked scene in Suffolk is too British for the international market. It is most likely to have gone to a British private buyer as our museums don’t have that kind of money.’",British museums couldn't afford to compete at Christie's auction .

Singer Noel Harrison, known by millions for The Windmills of Your Mind, has died at the age of 79 . Singer Noel Harrison, known by millions for hit song The Windmills of Your Mind, has died at the age of 79. The son of actor Rex Harrison, who was best known for recording the song on The Thomas Crown Affair soundtrack, performed for the final time on Saturday evening. He suffered a heart attack at his home in Devon and was taken to hospital - but died a few hours later. Speaking after the star's death, his wife Lori Chapman said: 'He will be loved and missed by more people than I ever knew.' She added that Harrison held an 'extremely successful' performance at the village hall in Black Dog, Devon, on Saturday, but had a 'long drive home' and was 'exhausted' when he returned. Harrison's career took off after he moved to America as part of a 'British invasion' spearheaded by The Beatles - where he starred in TV series The Girl From UNCLE and released chart hit A Young Girl and Suzanne by Leonard Cohen. His performance of The Windmills Of Your Mind won best song at the Oscars in 1968, and was later covered by other well-known artists, including Dusty Springfield and Petula Clark. The father-of-five once said he had not anticipated the song would become so popular and his 'most notable piece of work'. Scroll down for video . The singer, pictured left with father Rex Harrison, performed for the final time in Black Dog, Devon, on Saturday . 'It didn’t seem like a big deal at the time', he said of the track, which was the theme tune for the Amercian heist film The Thomas Crown Affair, starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway. 'I went to the studio one afternoon and sang it and pretty much forgot about it. 'I didn’t realise until later what a timeless, beautiful piece Michel Legrand and the Bergmans had written. 'It won best song at the 1968 Oscars and turned out to be my most notable piece of work.' Harrison was born in London on January 29, 1934 to Rex Harrison and Collette Thomas - the first of his Hollywood star father's six wives. Talented: Harrison is pictured in a scene from 1970s film Take A Girl Like You, directed by Jonathan Miller . He moved back to Britain in the 1990s and settled in Ashburton, Devon, before playing Glastonbury Festival's Spirit Of '71 stage in 2011. He was married three times and had five children and four grandchildren from his first two marriages. The actor and singer also had a passion for ski-racing - becoming British ski champion in 1953, before representing the country at the Olympics. Stefanie Powers, Harrison's co-star in The Girl From UNCLE, has paid tribute to the star on Twitter. She wrote: 'My darling friend Noel Harrison passed last night.

With his bulging muscles, determined stare and orange hue, this squirrel looks like he could give any Mr Universe competitor a run for his money. But the little creature hasn't been hitting the weights and protein shakes and his tan definitely hasn't come from a bottle. This cute photograph was taken by amateur photographer Ian Rentoul, 54, while on a visit to the British Wildlife Centre in Surrey. He explained that, rather than trying to strike a pose, the animal was battling against the autumnal weather and trying to stay atop his perch in a bid to get fed. Strike a pose: One of the British Wildlife Centre's red squirrels, left, looks like he is set to give eight times Mr Olympia champion bodybuilder Ronnie Coleman, right, a run for his money in the bulging biceps stakes . Mr Rentoul said: 'He was struggling to sit on his perch, as it was such a windy day, and it was in danger of being blown forwards, so this is why its muscles are so pronounced. 'I try to see the characters in each animal I photograph, and capture the expressions on their faces and really try to anthropomorphize them. 'Squirrels are good for this, because they have very expressive faces and movement.' After waiting only a matter of seconds for its food, the little red super squirrel quickly ran off in search of another person - or potential food source. Ian explains: 'The squirrels at The British Wildlife Centre are really quite tame and it and others will regularly jump on your shoulders and climb all over you. Under threat: Red squirrels, like the one pictured, could be wiped out in England in the next decade . 'The wind was coming from behind it, so its ear tufts were being blown flat. 'This is what first attracted me to take the image.' The red squirrel could be wiped out in England within the next decade, with fewer than 140,000 left. The decline of the red squirrel is due to its interaction with grey squirrels. The grey squirrel carries a virus, known as squirrelpox. But while the grey species is immune, the virus often proves deadly when passed on to reds. In addition, grey squirrels eat around seven times more than their red cousins and can be quite aggressive when looking for food, forcing reds out of the equation.","The squirrel was photographed by Ian Rentoul at the British Wildlife Centre .

Rumours have resurfaced about a device being developed by Google that could act as an interpreter. Google's gadget would not be quite as . high-tech as those seen in science fiction shows such as Star Trek and The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy, but could convert spoken . words into another language in real-time through a receiver. Google's vice president of Android, Hugo Barra, told The Times the device is an option and more recent developments in its Google Translate software could make it a reality. Google's universal translator could work in a similar way to the devices used by Captain Kirk, pictured left played by William Shatner and Bones, played by DeForest Kelley in Star Trek . Alternatively, the device could be fitted to people's clothes as seen in Star Trek: The Next Generation, pictured. In the show, UT devices were fitted to the communication pins of the crew including Data and Captain Picard . The universal translator (UT) was a device used in Star Trek to translate alien languages. In the early series of Star Trek, the UTs were shaped like tubes. In Star Trek: Enterprise the UTs looked similar to a flip phone. In Star Trek: Next Generation, UTs are built into the communication pins on Starfleet uniforms. Ferengis, including Quark from Deep Space Nine, have implants in their ear from birth. One exception is the Klingon language, which mostly can't be translated. Barra told The Times: 'We've got tons . of protoypes of that sort of interaction and I've played it every other . week to see how much progress we've made.' But he added that the software is still several years away from being ready. Barra also explained that some translations are 'near-perfect', such as English to Portuguese, while others are not. Universal translation devices were a common feature across the different Star Trek series. Ensign Hoshi Sato, a communications officer on the Enterprise in Star Trek: Enterprise, uses the translator to invent the linguacode matrix. By the 24th century, universal translators are built into the communicator pins worn by Starfleet personnel and the Ferengi race wear their universal translators as implants in their ears. In the Douglas Adam book, The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy, a small fish is inserted into the ear of a person. It can then read mental frequencies and translate conversations. Google's plans first emerged in 2010 when . Franz Och, Google's head of translation services, hinted that . speech-to-speech translation should be possible 'in a few year's time.' Google's Translate app, as well as other apps on the market, can already translate text from one language to another. They can also translate speech into text, yet they are not capable of converting speech to speech at the moment and voice translation has its limitations. In the Douglas Adam book, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a small fish that acts like an interpreter is inserted into the ear of a person. Dubbed Babel Fish, pictured, it can then read mental frequencies and translate conversations . Ferengis, such as Quark pictured from the TV series Deep Space Nine, are fitted with universal translation devices in their ears at birth . Voice-recognition on the apps and software also needs to be developed because background noise or poor microphones affects the accuracy of the recognition. Google Translate currently works with 71 languages, but there are around 6,000 languages worldwide leaving the service a little short. In February last year, Och admitted that any universal translation devices would also need to adapt to its user by 'learning' their style of . talking. 'Everyone has a different voice, accent and pitch,' said Mr Och. 'But recognition should be effective with mobile phones because by . nature they are personal to you.'

A commuter train that derailed as it entered a small town train station smashed into a lorry carrying a load of cars - but remarkably there were no serious injuries. The devastation in the wake of the massive collision between the train and the loaded truck has left people questioning how nobody was badly injured. Local residents in the town of Bartlett, Illinois, north east of Chicago, said they heard a loud 'boom'. Scroll down for video... Lucky escape: The driver of the car hauler had a lucky escape when it was in a collision with a Metra passenger train in the Illinois town of Bartlett . Crumpled: The car hauler cargo was thrown from the truck in the crash hitting other parked cars in the train station lot . Two passengers travelling on the train reportedly suffered minor injuries from the collision. There were 20 people on the train. According to CBS Chicago, the crash happened at around 4pm between a Metra V and a car hauler. Metra spokeswoman Meg Reile said the train was travelling from Elgin towards Chicago and hit the semitrailer as it was arriving at the Bartlett depot. The crash shut down service on the Milwaukee District West Line. It also damaged and derailed the front car of the train, she said. The vehicles that were on the car hauler crashed into some of the parked cars at the train station. Metra is now investigating what caused the collision. A spokesman for the rail firm would not be drawn by the CBS reporter on whether the truck or the train driver was to blame. Train incidents in America are not uncommon, with several reported this month alone. Delays: Metra spokeswoman Meg Reile said the crash shut down services on the Milwaukee District West Line . Commuters were forced to wait or find other means of getting to Chicago after the crash caused major delays on the line . In San Francisco, two transit workers were killed on Saturday after being struck by an out-of-service train on a routine maintenance run. The men were assessing a reported dip in the tracks. One person was killed and 24 injured when a logging truck collided with a sight-seeing train in the West Virginia Mountains earlier in the month. And in Canada, residents in a small hamlet were evacuated after an cargo train carrying oil derailed and exploded into flames on Saturday. Residents in Gainford, about 50 miles from Edmonton, were taken to safety when the 13-carriage train, four carrying petroleum crude oil and nine loaded with liquified petroleum gas, exploded at around 1am. Metra is now investigating what caused the collision. A spokesman for the rail firm would not be drawn on whether the truck driver or the train driver was to blame . Given the amount of devastation that was caused, local residents and investigators were relieved that the collateral damage was not worse . The crash was reminiscent of the horrific tragic oil tanker train crash in July, which incinerated the small Quebec town of Lac-Mégantic near the Maine border, killing 47 people. Questions about the increasing use of trains to transport highly flammable fuels are increasing.","Crash happened as passenger train came into Bartlett station, near Chicago .

The latest in a spate of e-cigarette explosions have health and fire officials warning 'vapers' - as e-smokers have come to be known - that 'healthier' alternatives to smoking are far from danger-free. Firefighters in the town of La Crosse, Wisconsin, responded to an incident this week where an e-cigarette erupted from its charger, launching about 25 feet from the power socket to start a fire across the room, according to News8000. An e-cigarette on charge overheated and exploded across the room, causing a fire at a home in La Crosse, Wisconsin, this week. No residents were injured and the flames were quickly put out . Fire officials have warned e-cigarettes are at their most dangerous while on charge. Unlike other electronic devices, such as cellphones, they don't have the techonology to switch off once the battery is charged, causing the coil to overheat and explode . E-cigarettes, which heat liquid nicotine into a smoke-like water vapor, have skyrocketed since their introduction in 2007. Some 250 companies are producing them and there are predictions they could outsell tobacco in a decade. While yearly sales were originally hitting $50,000, the market now looks set to top $1 billion. Most recent estimations had 3.5 million American users. But fire officials have warned that e-cigarette users are leaving their devices on charge too long. Unlike other battery-operated equipment, such as cellphones, e-cigarettes don't have an inbuilt default setting to switch off once the battery is full. Dangerous: Marks from an e-Cigarette exploded at a home in La Crosse, Wisconsin . Listen carefully: La Crosse Fire Department division chief Craig Snyder explains why so many e-cigarettes are exploding across the nation . 'Those lithium-ion batteries don't have an overcurrent protection to them, so they continue to draw on that heat  until the coil overheats and the lithium-ion actually explode in the unit,' said La Crosse Fire Department Division Chief Craig Snyder. The fire is the latest of many explosions that are happening across the country. Last month, father-of-three Chris Thomas said he was 'terrified' when his e-cigarette exploded from his in-car charger onto the backseat, which was almost destroyed by an ensuing fire. The flames also came dangerously close to his headrest. Chris Thomas shows how his exploding e-cigarette all-but destroyed the backseat of his car. He said the device 'went off like a firework' Extensive: Fire from an e-cigarette consumes the backseat of Chris Thomas' car last month . Close call: The flames also threatened the front seats. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have said the problem with e-cigarettes is a combination of how new they are and their astonishingly fast rise in popularity. 'As the safety and efficacy of e-cigarettes have not been fully studied, consumers … have no way of knowing whether (they) are safe for their intended use,' said FDA spokeswoman Jennifer Haliski. Also last month, a toddler was 'fortunate' to escape a car fire with only minor injuries after his mother's e-cigarette overheated and projected onto the backseat. His mother, Kinzie Barlow, was driving in Provo, Utah, when the coil inside her device exploded out of the casing while it was on charge in the car. The coil bounced off the ceiling and into the car seat of her son, Khonor, in the back. 'Then there was a big bang, and kind of a flash, and there's smoke everywhere,' she told Salt Lake City TV station KSTU. Khonor Barlow, 3, recieved first and second degree burns to his lower back (right) after his mother's e-cigarette exploded in their car, landing in his baby seat. Relieved: Kinzie Barlow was driving in Provo with her son, Khonor, when her electronic cigarette 'went bang' in its charger . Looks harmless enough: Huge marketing campaigns are being run to promote e-cigarettes, with some 250 companies now producing them. But there is still a long way to go before they are 'perfected' Barlow attempt to smother the flames with her sleeve, but that also caught fire. She then grabbed an iced coffee from the front seat and poured it on Khonor, putting out the fire. The little boy received first and second-degree burns to his lower back. Thankfully, changes have started to be made to the technology of some e-cigarettes. Mike Swafford, who owns the E-Cig Clubhouse, said some high-end brands have recently started to make 'overcharge protection'. However there are plenty of cheaper 'imitations' available for cheaper. 'The real eGo-T battery is made by Joytech and they are the ones with an emblem on the bottom,' he  told Fox.","New fire in Wisconsin signals a review of e-cigarette technology .

Sting and Sir Richard Branson have been accused of using Uruguay as a 'laboratory' for the drug reform after backing a campaign to legalise cannabis in the country. Uruguay is set to become the first nation in the world to allow anyone to grow, sell and consume cannabis freely. The legal changes were brought about after a high-profile lobbying and TV campaign by pressure group the Drug Policy Alliance, on which both Sting and Sir Richard Branson are honorary international board members. Meddling: Pop star Sting, left, and Sir Richard Branson, right, are honorary members of the international board of pro-reform pressure group Drug Policy Alliance which has been accused of meddling in Uruaguay's politics . But the involvement of this influential American drug law reform organisation has been branded as 'meddling' and prompted a fierce backlash from critics of the legal changes. Gerardo Amarilla, of the opposition National Party, launched a blistering attack on the two celebrities, accusing them of risking the health of a generation with their 'meddling' and turning the country into a 'laboratory' for reform. He said: 'They shouldn't be meddling in Uruguay. 'They should be lobbying in their own country because they're not going to suffer the consequences here, the security and health problems. Controversy: President Jose Mujica has seen his efforts to explore alternatives to the global war on drugs succeed in the face of opposition . 'They're out of context here. This is a test that could go wrong and harm a generation.' Speaking shortly after legislation was passed though congress, last week, Mr Amarilla, said the Uruaguan government was ‘playing with . fire’ given the health risks he said were linked to marijuana use and . the majority of Uruguayans are said to be against the decriminalisation . move' You must be toking: Uruguay's unprecedented plan to put the government at the center of a legal marijuana industry has made it halfway through congress . He said the government was underestimating the risk of marijuana, which he . called a 'gateway drug' for other chemical addictions that foster . violent crimes. 'Ninety-eight percent of those who are today destroying themselves with base cocaine began with marijuana,' Responding to the controversy, Sir . Richard Branson said: 'While I am a member of the Drug Policy Alliance . International Honorary Board (In Formation), I am an active member of . the Global Commission on Drug Policy. 'For the past few years we have . examined the war on drugs using a science-based approach. 'We feel . strongly that it has failed and that there needs to be a different . approach. 'We believe drugs should be treated as . a health problem not a criminal problem. 'This is a global problem, not a . national issue, and everyone who can should speak out to help change . the failed war on drugs.' Under a new bill passed by Uruguayan lawmakers, only the government would be allowed to sell the drug. The controversial measure has the backing of President Jose Mujica, who says it will remove the profits from drug peddlers and divert users from harder drugs. Uruguay’s House of Representatives passed the bill by 50 to 46 votes following a fierce debate earlier this month and it is expected to get an easier passage through the Senate to become law in the next few weeks. Buyers would have to be over 18 and would be able to grow six plants at home or buy up to 40g (1.4 oz)a month in specially licenced government pharmacies. The authorities would take control of every aspect of the marijuana business, from harvesting the plant right through to distribution and sale. Ganja-rous game: Marijuana legalization efforts have gained momentum across the Americas in recent years as leaders watch the death toll rise from military responses to unabated drug trafficking in Mexico and Central America . And in an effort to prevent foreign tourists from flocking to Uruguay to smoke marijuana, the legislation would restrict legal purchases to Uruguayans. The vote also came days after Pope Francis criticised drug legalisation plans during a visit to neighbouring Brazil. He said it was ‘necessary to tackle the problems which are at the root of drug abuse, promoting more justice, educating the youth with the values that live in society, standing by those who face hardship and giving them hope for the future.’ Sting was unavailable for comment.","Uruguay is set to become first country in the world to legalise marijuana .

This bride certainly made an entrance by turning up to the wedding in a fire engine after her original transport burst into flames. Irini Georgiou, 23, was on her way to her traditional church ceremony in a 1969 vintage Plymouth Barracuda car when smoke began to billow from the engine. Clutching her bouquet and dressed in a long white gown, Irini, her father Michael Georgiou, 48, and two bridesmaids were forced to jump out of the burning vehicle. Way to make an entrance: Irini Georgiou, 23, arrived at her church wedding in a fire engine after her original transport burst into flames . Rescue: Irini Georgiou and her wedding party were given a lift by firefighters after her transport, a 1969 vintage Plymouth Barracuda, began smoking before bursting into flames . Fire fighters rushed to the scene and managed to extinguish the blaze - even rescuing bottles of champagne from the boot. But Irina and her wedding party were left stranded without a way to get to Christ Church at Little Heath, near Brookmans Park, Hertfordshire. So the fire fighters offered to give her lift - sweeping her up to the church in style on Sunday, complete with flashing blue lights. Teacher Irini, of Potters Bar, Hertforshire, said: 'I was just laughing at first, I'm quite a laid back person, I was just thinking ""can this really be happening to me?"" 'The firefighters were simply great and we thank them so much for getting me to church. 'This is one big day we'll never forget!' Her groom, Phillip Critoph, 24, was delighted and relieved to see her - as she finally turned up just 30 minutes late. A day to remember: Irini Georgiou, 23, pictured with her father Michael Georgiou, 48, after firefighters got her to her wedding ceremony in Hertfordshire just half an hour late . Special day: The rest of Irini Georgiou's wedding on Sunday to Phillip Critoph, 24, went smoothly . The builder added: 'I was a bit worried, because Irene was a little bit late, but it was quite exciting.' Her father, Mr Georgiou added: 'We just didn't know how we were going to get to church. 'But the fire brigade came to our rescue as they put away their pumps and offered Irene and I a lift. 'We certainly arrived in great style - albeit 30 minutes late!' But there was not enough space for all of them in the fire truck so one of the fire fighters transported the bridesmaids in a separate car. Mr Georgiou continued: 'One of the firefighters had to go in a Nissan Micra with the bridesmaids and they were over the moon about that. 'We had a few panic-stricken moments ' but it all worked out OK in the end.' The happy couple had two days to recover from their excitement before they jetted off to Greek sunshine island Rhodes today on a two-week honeymoon.

Nine-year-old Holly Lindley has glycogen storage disease, which means her body cant convert the food she eats into energy . Meet the little girl who has to drink six pints of milk every day to keep her alive. Nine-year-old Holly Lindley has glycogen storage disease, which means her body can't convert the food she eats into energy. There is no treatment for the condition so the youngster has to gulp down cold milk mixed with five spoonfuls of cornflour before bed to stop her falling into a coma. The cornflour contains starch, which acts as a slow release of energy during the night. Her mother Karen Shaw, 35, who has spent almost £2,000 on milk since the treatment began three years ago, said: 'We have to make sure she always drinks it because some nights she doesn't want to. 'We have to remind her it's for her own good. 'It would be easy if she drank fizzy drinks that are loaded with sugar but she doesn't like them so milk it is. We get through so much in this house.' 'Holly was diagnosed aged two after she collapsed at her home in Doncaster and her neighbour had to resuscitate her. Doctors at Doncaster Royal Infirmary noticed her blood levels dropped dangerously low, leading them to believe she had the rare disorder, which affects just one in three million people. Her energy levels had to be closely monitored and Karen had to wake her up every two hours to give her toast. Mrs Shaw said: 'We were in and out of hospital. It was extremely stressful. It went over my head when they told me. We became always on edge. 'If I didn't give her food during the night, her energy levels would get too low while she slept. She sleeps around 11 hours a night. 'For about four years after she was diagnosed we really struggled, but now we understand it more and can control it better.' There is no treatment for the condition so the youngster has to gulp down cold milk mixed with five spoonfuls of cornflour before bed to stop her falling into a coma . Holly also has to do drink milk throughout the day - and can drink up to six pints. As she gets older and needs more energy, this will have to increase. Mrs Shaw said: 'She loves milk and she's got used to the cornflour now. It's normal to her. She just doesn't like it when it gets to the bottom and it's all powdery. 'As well as drinking milk, Holly snacks on chocolate and sweets between every meal - I'm sure she's the only girl at school that gets two chocolate bars in her lunch box.' Holly lives with her mum and stepdad, Alan, along with her two brothers. They try to maintain a normal family life despite Holly's condition. Holly (pictured with mother Karen) also has to do drink milk throughout the day - up to six pints. As she gets older and needs more energy, this will have to increase . Mrs Shaw said: 'Her brothers are older so they get very protective of her, but they do torment her too. They say she gets away with everything. 'I try to keep everything as normal as possible, but Holly still gets embarrassed about her condition. 'When she went on her first overnight school trip I had to have a word with her teachers because she didn't want to drink the milk with cornflower in front of her friends. 'Now she's older she understands it better and knows she needs to drink it to keep her alive. She's less embarrassed and will go to sleep overs and on school trips. Her friends all call it Holly's special milk. 'At the moment we have to do blood checks so that we know Holly's energy level is safe, but I'm hoping that one day she'll know herself when she needs to get her energy up and eat more accordingly.' Glycogen storage disease is where the body cannot convert food eaten into energy. Glucose is a major source of energy . for the body. It is stored in the form of glycogen in both the liver and . muscles and later released with the help of enzymes. People affected . by the disorder have an inherited defect in one of the enzymes responsible for forming or releasing glycogen as it is needed by the body during exercise and/or between meals.","Holly Lindley, 9, has glycogen storage disease, which means her body can't convert the food she eats into energy .

More school pupils are being drawn into gangs since last summer's riots with children attending classes wearing gang colours, a report reveals. It claims that growing numbers of primary school children are being drawn into a web of gang-related violence. And it reveals that the arrests of more than 200 leaders of London street gangs in the wake of last year's riots has led to an increase in 'chaos, violence and anarchy' in the capital, a report claimed today. Shocking: Children are attending lessons wearing gang colours, a new report has revealed . Prime Minister David Cameron promised an . 'all-out war on gangs and gang culture' following the riots which . brought mayhem to many English cities in the summer of 2011, and police . have responded by arresting many of those associated with criminal . groups. But today's report, by the Centre for Social Justice thinktank, warned that the removal of the so-called 'elders' from the streets has backfired by creating a power vacuum in which younger and more hot-headed members seized control of gangs on a wave of violence. Drawing on interviews with community leaders and former gang members, it warned of an 'escalation' of violence as more junior members - known as 'youngers' - vie for status and respect in the absence of the restraining hand of older figures who had imposed a code of behaviour. 'There was a consensus that the current gangs neither have such a code nor cohesive leadership, which is resulting in increased chaos, violence and anarchy,' said the report by the CSJ, which was founded by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith . Crackdown: Prime Minister David Cameron promised an 'all-out war on gangs and gang culture' following the riots which brought mayhem to many English cities in the summer of 2011 . It also reported a 'startling' increase in the number of girl gang members and a rise in sexual violence within gangs, citing one case in which a 13-year-old girl involved with a gang was being sexually exploited by members and was grooming her own 10-year-old sister for the same purpose. CSJ managing director Christian Guy said that the police crackdown after the riots had 'created a Lord of the Flies environment in which anything goes'. He added: 'Gangs played a significant role in the riots and it is dangerous to pretend otherwise - in London at least one in five of those convicted was a known to be part of a gang. 'The Prime Minister declared an all-out war on gang culture after the riots, which culminated in a radical strategy heavily influenced by the CSJ's own gangs research. Concerning: CSJ managing director Christian Guy said that the police crackdown after the riots had 'created a Lord of the Flies environment in which anything goes' But one year on political commitment is waning and the Government and local authorities have mistakenly assumed that its new strategy represents job done - it could not be more wrong. 'We have talked to members of our countrywide alliance of small, frontline organisations and charities asking them how they feel gang culture has changed in the light of the Government response. Worryingly many have drawn us a picture of little or no progress.' Under scrutiny: British Prime Minister David Cameron's gang crackdown seems to have failed . In the wake of the riots, the Metropolitan Police created a centralised database of the most harmful gang members, and Operation Trident had its remit extended from gun crime to broader gun-related issues. Today's report, entitled Time to Wake Up, welcomed the Met's efforts, but said they need to be backed up by a broader Government strategy emphasising the need to stop young people joining gangs in the first place. 'Many in Whitehall regard the riots as a random one-off, and mistake the quashing of the disorder as control of the streets,' it said. 'They could not be more wrong. The alarming fact is that many streets across the country are besieged by anarchy and violence. There is no control in such neighbourhoods.' The CSJ report recommended 'addressing the drivers of gang culture, not just the symptoms', including a new multi-agency Whitehall task force to ensure that as much focus is put on prevention as on enforcement. It said: 'The surest way of eliminating gangs is to try to ensure that children and young people never want or feel the need to join them. To do this we need to tackle deeper issues in our society and seek to nurture and support ever-strong families and stronger communities.' A government spokesman said: 'Our Ending Gang and Youth Violence strategy makes clear this problem cannot be tackled through police enforcement alone. That's why a £10 million fund is helping to stop the next generation of gang members as well as targeting those already involved in violence. 'There's also a new network of Young People's Advocates to provide direct support to victims of gang-related sexual violence and we introduced gang injunctions for 14-17 year olds. 'There are no quick fixes but we are seeing results. The Crime Survey for England and Wales shows that crime is down by 6%, and police figures show knife crime is down by 9%.'","Report released today has branded David Cameron's war on 'gang culture' after the 2011 riots a failure .

'I used to get scared just looking at the height, twists, and turns of some rides - but none of them daunt me anymore. 'In fact, I'm more nervous about theme park ghost trains. 'I tend to ride each rollercoaster several times in a bid to find the best seat, because the experience varies massively depending on where you sit. 'You get a better view at the front, but you get more G-force at the back, meaning your arms are pinned down by your side and you can't move. 'I like to find a seat where you get lots of negative G - the feeling of weightlessness and your stomach turning. 'I'm not much of a screamer. Instead, I prefer to whoop and cheer as I whizz round, then applaud or punch the air with joy at the end. 'I get this incredible rush of adrenaline and a real buzz from the rides. 'It's a form of escapism, which allows me to forget the stresses of everyday life and lose myself in the moment.' Mr Gaines said his partner Susie Clarke, 34, 'tolerates' his hobby and their son Thomas, two, has notched up a count of three coasters already. Miss Clarke occasionally travels abroad with Marcus, when she allows him a few days to explore the theme parks before returning to a more traditional break. He said: 'Since having Thomas, I'm looking at theme parks in a different way and making a note of those I wish to return to when he gets older. 'I'm not pushing my passion onto him but I do hope he will take an interest. 'He is already fascinated by our local theme park, where he knows how the safety bar works, and has walked straight off a ride and back to the queue.' Mr Gaines added: 'From my travels, I've seen how different nationalities embrace rollercoasters in different ways.

A woman gave a stranger's baby a feeding bottle filled with bleach in a branch of McDonald's, a jury ruled today. Elaine Joyner, 53, has been charged with administering a poison or noxious substance so as to endanger life, and jurors at Woolwich Crown Court today declared that she had fed bleach to the child. The 11-month-old boy drank some of the liquid after Joyner handed it to him, then vomited from the poisonous effects of the bleach. Judge Andrew Lees had previously ruled that Joyner was unfit to plead, and a trial to decide the question of what happened in the Eltham branch of the fast-food restaurant therefore took place in her absence. Scene: The 11-month-old boy drank some of the liquid and vomited after being handed the bottle in a branch of McDonald's (pictured) in Eltham, south-east London, Woolwich Crown Court was told . A jury of five men and seven women took . just half an hour to decide that it was Joyner who gave the child . bleach, and that it had not been a case of mistaken identity. The jury had been told by the judge that the main issue in the trial concerned the identification of the poisoner as being Joyner. Police had compiled CCTV evidence which showed a woman carrying a baby's bottle, walking along the High Street in Eltham, and entering McDonald's, where she is seen to pass the bottle towards the boy. 'The prosecution say that this woman is the defendant,' the judge said. 'There is no witness present at McDonald's who has identified the defendant. However police circulated a still image showing the woman in the entrance of McDonald's. 'That was seen by Police Constable Sandra Voak who recognised the woman in the image as the defendant, who she had seen in July 2011.' The judge said the jury could also consider that clothing similar to that worn by the woman in the CCTV had been found at the defendant's address, and also that Joyner's partner Fred Warwick, 68, had said she told him she had been to Eltham that day. Home: Elaine Joyner, 53, of Vaughan Williams Close, Deptford, south-east London, is charged with administering a poison or noxious substance so as to endanger life.

He earlier told the jury: ‘In this case the defendant has been found by me to be unfit to stand her trial. ‘I . have decided on the evidence of two specialist medical practitioners, . one instructed by the defence, one by the prosecution, that she is . mentally ill, such that she cannot understand the proceedings, cannot . understand the evidence, and cannot give valid instructions to her legal . team.’ It was appropriate . that she did not attend, he added. In such circumstances, there was not a . finding of guilty or not guilty, but the jury should instead decide . whether or not she did the act she was alleged to have done. 'Some random person had given my baby a bottle, which he had drunk from and was vomiting. As far as I was concerned, my baby had been poisoned' Mother of baby . Peter Clark, prosecuting, told the jury yesterday that the incident took place last September at the McDonald’s branch. He said: ‘Elaine Joyner, say the . prosecution, gave to a complete stranger’s baby a feeding bottle that . contained a poisonous or noxious substance, a fluid that contained . bleach, or something very similar. ‘The . baby, who was 11 and a half months old, took some of that fluid in his . mouth and was immediately rendered ill by it. He retched and vomited . over himself and turned very pale.’ His . grandmother seized it from the pram to prevent further harm, Mr Clark . said. The baby - who cannot be identified for legal reasons - made a . good recovery with no long-term ill effects, he added. ‘Ingestion of bleach can prove fatal, and in the case of such a young child is particularly hazardous.’ A . statement from the child’s grandmother was read, in which said she was . looking after the baby in McDonald’s while his mother was at the counter . and she saw him retching and dribbling. ‘I reached for a bottle that was in . his pram. As I looked into it I noticed it was orange in colour with . white milk particles in it. It was extremely frothy on the top. ‘I . realised that he had drunk something that we had not given him. Three . black girls said that a woman had walked past and given him a bottle.’ The . mother said in a statement: ‘Some random person had given my baby a . bottle, which he had drunk from and was vomiting. As far as I was . concerned, my baby had been poisoned.’ Trainee Detective Constable Sandra Voak - formerly a uniformed Police Constable - told the court she had identified Joyner from a CCTV photograph from that day last September as someone she had dealings with in 2011. She said she spent an hour with her in July that year, including 15 minutes sitting next to her in a car. Asked by Stella Harris, defending, if she was sure that the person she had seen in the CCTV image was the same woman she had dealings with in 2011, she said: ‘I am absolutely certain that is the same person.’ The hearing has been adjourned until July, when Joyner will attend court to discover how her case will be dealt with.

False prescription: Mahfooz Ulhaq doctored his prescription in an attempt to het hold of Viagra on the NHS . A conman tried to get Viagra on the . NHS by altering his prescription - but he was caught out when . pharmacists spotted he had spelled the drug's name wrong. Mahfooz . Ulhaq, 45, scribbled over his doctor's handwriting in an attempt to get . hold of the erectile dysfunction drug in Nottingham city centre. But . two pharmacists who were handed the prescriptions contacted the . defendant's GP surgery and discovered that he was not supposed to . receive it. Ulhaq - who stood up in the dock with the aid of a crutch - admitted two charges of making false prescriptions with the intention of gaining pharmaceutical drugs at Nottingham Magistrates' Court. He was sentenced to a suspended jail term. Chair of magistrates Patricia Boyce-Forgenie told him: 'It is very serious. You are on a lot of medication and do not know how Viagra would have interacted with the other medication. 'It was very risky thing to do.' Neil Hollett, prosecuting, said Ulhaq tried to obtain the drugs from the Nottingham City Hospital’s outpatients’ pharmacy and from a nearby Boots pharmacy. 'On the first occasion a member of staff brought to the attention of the pharmacist that the defendant was back to collect some medication he already had,' he said. 'They could see the doctor’s handwriting had been overwritten and other medication added on the prescription. 'It also contained spelling errors. It was shown to the doctor who had prescribed it and found to be fraudulently altered.' Mr Hollett said that another member of . staff said Ulhaq had requested his medication to be dispensed in . disguised bottles as 'he didn’t want his family knowing what he was . diagnosed with'. On the second occasion, Ulhaq dropped off a prescription and said he would collect it the following day. Mr . Hollett added: 'When a member of staff came to dispense it, they found . something not quite right. It said 100ml when it was meant to be 100mg. Pharmacy con: Ulhaq tried to get hold of the drug at Nottingham City Hospital when he went to the outpatients' pharmacy. However, pharmacists spotted errors with his prescription and he was denied the drug . 'They believed it had been altered.' The court heard Ulhaq, from Aspley, Nottinghamshire, went in the next day and was refused his prescription and the prescribing doctor confirmed it had been altered. Ulhaq was arrested and told police he had written on both prescriptions but claimed he had no intention of getting the Viagra. He said he had lost another prescription and had written on those ones to remember what had been on it. Defending Chris Brewin said: 'Daily life for Mr Ulhaq is extremely difficult. He has spinal problems which affect his mobility. 'He was prescribed Viagra but what happened was the separate prescription became soiled, and the solution was to add Viagra to another prescription. 'He knows this was wrong. He is very disappointed to find himself back before the court.' Ulhaq was sentenced to four months in prison, suspended for a year. He was also ordered to pay £85 costs and a £80 victim surcharge.","Mahfooz Ulhaq, 45, handed his doctored prescription in at two pharmacies .

A school principal and her husband have been charged with murder after 23 children died from eating pesticide-contaminated lunches at a school in eastern India. Nearly 50 people, the majority of whom were young children aged five to 12, became sick at the rural school in the eastern state of Bihar after eating the food in July. Almost half died. Police officer Varun Kumar Sinha said the school's headteacher Meena Kumari and her husband are set to face trial soon - they could face the death penalty if convicted. School principal Meena Kumari, pictured arriving at the district court in Saran district in India's Bihar state. She and her husband Arjun Rai have been charged with murder . Buried in the playground: Villagers look on as three of the children who died after eating food contaminated with pesticide are buried in the grounds of the school . Protest: Villagers chose to bury the youngsters in the school playground in protest against what they describe as government negligence . Tragic: Villagers gather round as the bodies are buried following the poisoning . Mass tragedy: Villagers stand around the burial . mound of a child in front of the school where she was fed contaminated . food. Police said the school's head had ignored warnings from the cook about the food . Investigating police officer Raj . Kaushal said the principal's husband, opposition politician Arjun Rai, . stored pesticide at the school, which was used on his agricultural farm. The school principal and her husband both deny the charges and have told police there was no deliberate act on their part. The charge sheet, filed in a court in Bihar state on Sunday, said the school chef cooked with the poison by mistake. Cooks have told police that the principal controlled the food for the government-provided free daily lunch. The headmistress fled her home, as police . claimed she forced a reluctant cook to serve up the food. Authorities say the cook had warned the head of the rural school, that . the cooking oil may have been contaminated. She had complained that the oil looked strange and gave off a foil smell when heated, but her concerns were dismissed. 'The headmistress said ""continue cooking and serve the food to the children"",' said Police Superintendent Sujeet Kumar. It . is thought that many of the children who ate the meal may have been . saved had the headmistress tasted the food before it was served, as . required under the rules of the Midday Meal Scheme. Children are said to be far more vulnerable to this type of poisoning than adults as they have low body weight. Soon . after the potato curry and rice was served at the school in rural . Chappra, Bihar, one of India's poorest states, pupils started . complaining of stomach cramps, then began to vomit and collapse. Grief: Women mourn the death of their children who died after consuming the contaminated meals . Family members of a school girl (not pictured) mourn her death: Twenty-three youngsters died after eating the food, and dozens more remain in hospital after suffering sever poisoning . Ninety . minutes later, the first victim, named as four-and-a-half year old Anshu Kumar, died on the way to hospital. Death came . so quickly for some that they died in their parents' arms while being . taken to hospital. Dozens of other children were treated for food poisoning. Authorities . discovered a container of pesticide in the school's cooking area next . to the vegetable oil and mustard oil, said Amarjeet Sinha, a top official in Bihar. In the aftermath of the tragedy the families . of some of the 22 primary school pupils who died buried the children in the . school playground in protest at 'government negligence'. Police initially arrested the school cook believing the poisoning could have . been part of a political feud between two branches of the same family, a . local police chief said. The . incident followed provincial elections in which Arsal Khan . Khichi lost to his cousin Jehanzaeb Khan Khichi, police chief Sadiq . Dogar said at the time. Investigators believe that mustard oil used in the cooking had been contaminated with organophosphate pesticides. Several of the parents buried their children in front of the school. Madav . Ram, whose 12-year-old son Rahul was one of the children who died, told . the Daily Telegraph: 'We decided to bury our children in front of the . school building to remind the government that they died because of their . negligence. 'We also plan to raise a memorial in the memory of the dead children inside the school.' Villagers stand next to mass graves of the schoolchildren who died: Authorities discovered a container of pesticide in the school's cooking area next to the vegetable oil and mustard oil .

Abandoned: A villager looks back towards the locked house of the headmistress of a school, who fled with her family after children started dying. The cooks said that the teacher controlled the food for the free daily lunch . Arsal Khan Khichi is accused of paying . a cook, Mohammad Rafiq, 50,000 rupees ($500) to poison food at his . rival's home on June 9, Dogar said. Nearly 50 people became sick and . were taken to the hospital, and 22 died. Jehanzeb Khan Khichi was not at . home when the incident occurred, Dogar said. Rafiq has confessed to poisoning the . food, Dogar said. Police waited to arrest him until they received . medical reports that confirmed the dead had been poisoned. Arsal Khan . Khichi is still on the run, and a murder case has been registered . against him as well, Dogar said. 'It's . not a case of food poisoning. It's a case of poison in food in a large . quantity, going by the instant deaths,' Mr Sinha said. Local farmer Ajay Kumar's 5-year-old daughter was among the victims. He was in his house, which is about 100 metres from the school, when he heard screams from neighbours saying the children had fallen ill. 'I rushed there and all the kids were on their backs or clutching their stomachs or vomiting. I picked up my girl and took her to the local hospital right away,' Ajay said. Parents hitched rides or took public transport to get to the hospital, which is about nine miles from the village, he said. Medical staff told them they had no medicines to give them. His daughter died shortly afterwards, writhing in pain on the floor. When Reuters visited the village, there were at least 18 burial mounds, many in a large field opposite the school. Some contained multiple bodies and villagers could not agree on how many children were buried in them. Many parents said they buried their children's toys and clothes in the graves. The . cooks, Manju Devi and Pano Devi, told The Associated Press that the . principal controlled the food for the free daily lunch provided by the . government at the school. She . gave them rice, potatoes, soy and other ingredients needed to prepare . the meal for Tuesday lunchtime and then went about her business. As the . children ate, they started fainting, the cooks said. The two cooks were not spared either. Manju Devi, 30, ate some of the food and fainted. Her three children, ages five, eight and 13, fell ill as well. While Pano Devi, 35, didn't eat the tainted food, her three children did. Two of them died and the third, a four-year-old daughter, was in the hospital. 'I will stop cooking at the school,' she said. 'I am so horrified that I wouldn't grieve more if my only surviving child died.' Doctors treating the children said they suspected the food had been contaminated with insecticide. Media reports said the cooking oil may have been stored in an old pesticide container, but there was no independent confirmation of this. 'The minute the children were brought in, we smelled this foul odour of organophosphorus,' said Dr. Vinod Mishra, a doctor in the medical team treating many of the children at Patna Medical College Hospital in Bihar's capital, Patna. Organophosphorus compounds are used as pesticides, which are widely available and are sold under a variety of different brands. Dozens sick: Schoolchildren receive treatment at a hospital after falling ill soon after eating free school meals . Treatment: The meal was cooked in the school kitchen, but school authorities stopped serving it as children started vomiting . The free midday meal was served to the . children in Gandamal village in Masrakh block, 50 miles north . of Patna, the Bihar state capital. Those . who survived the poison were unlikely to suffer from any serious after . effects from the tainted food, said Patna Medical College hospital . superintendent Amarkant Jha Amar. 'There . will be no remnant effects on them. The effects of poisoning will be . washed after a certain period of time from the tissues,' Mr Amar said. He . said that the post-mortem reports on the children who died confirmed . that insecticide was either in the food or cooking oil. He said . authorities were waiting for lab results for more details on the . chemicals. Horror: A father mourns as he holds his dead daughter today inside an ambulance, outside a hospital in Patna, in the eastern Indian state of Bihar . Location: It was not immediately clear how chemicals ended up in the food in a school in Masrakh, near Patna in Bihar, although one official said the food may not have been properly washed before it was cooked . The midday . meal plan is one of the world's biggest school nutrition programs. State . governments have the freedom to decide on menus and timings of the . meals, depending on local conditions and availability of food rations. It . was first introduced in the 19602 in southern India, where it was . seen as an incentive for poor parents to send their children to school. Since . then, the program has spread across the country, covering some . 120million schoolchildren. It's part of an effort to address concerns . about malnutrition, which the government says nearly half of all Indian . children suffer from. Although . there have been complaints about the quality of the food served and the . lack of hygiene, the incident in Bihar appeared to be unprecedented for . the massive food program.","Teacher Meena Kumari and her husband, politician Arjun Rai deny charges .

The girl's mother Candace Watts, 22, admitted to knowing about the assaults and failing to alert police. Watts was also sentenced yesterday to between 18 months and seven years in prison.

A mother has been fined £400 because her son missed a day of school nearly nine years ago because he had severe headaches as a result of an undiagnosed brain tumour. Darilyn Rothwell, 51, from Radcliffe, Manchester, was given just seven days to pay the fine which was issued because her 24-year-old son Chris Barlow was off sick when he was a teenager in November 2004. She claims she had informed the school that her son, who had to take several sick days in the months before his diagnosis, was ill but she was fined for his 'truancy' anyway. Upset: The fine has been upsetting for Mrs Rothwell as it has also brought back bad memories of her son's battle with cancer . Mr Barlow, who now has three children . of his own, collapsed with seizures in January 2005 and was on a life . support machine for three days at Royal Bolton Hospital. He was diagnosed with a brain tumour and underwent numerous operations. Mrs . Rothwell was taken to court by Bolton Council later that year after . education bosses claimed she was not doing enough to get her son back to . lessons at Harper Green School in Farnworth after his treatment. The case was thrown out by magistrates and Mrs Rothwell assumed that was the end of the matter. However, . she has now been issued with a letter by debt recovery firm Marston . Group, who were acting on instruction from HM Courts & Tribunal Service, ordering her to pay a £405 court fine within seven days. If . the mother-of-three does not pay the fine she has been threatened with . bailiffs coming to her house and the sale of her possessions by public . auction. A spokesman for the council claimed . the fine related to a case when Mrs Rothwell was found guilty in her . absence of allowing her son to be truant. But she claims she was only aware of . the later case which she attended and that she 'had never heard . anything' about the earlier hearing or the fine until last week. Demand: Mrs Rothwell was sent a letter from Marston, acting on the instruction of HM Courts & Tribunals Service, asking for the £405 fine . She said: 'When Chris first started getting headaches I first thought he was a typical teenager blagging to try to get time off school but he was in tears with the pain. 'We thought it was migraines and the doctors put it down to migraines too. 'I called the school every time Chris was sick so I don't know why this has been put down as an unauthorised absence. 'I would have thought I would have got a letter about this from the court, but I have never heard anything about this fine before until the letter landed on my doorstep last week.' Mr Barlow was in hospital for five weeks after he collapsed and then spent two years undergoing treatment. Doctors cannot operate on the benign tumour in his brain and he will have to take medication and attend regular check-ups for the rest of his life. Since receiving the debt collection . order this week, Mrs Rothwell said she has been unable to sleep as it . has brought back memories of the difficult time. 'It’s eight years (since Chris was in hospital) now and we get hit by this from absolutely nowhere. It’s not just the financial stress of being told we’ve got to find this money but it brings all those awful memories back up again. 'As far as we’re concerned there’s no fine to be paid, but even if there was it seems bizarre that after hearing nothing for eight years we suddenly get a letter saying we’ve got to pay this money within seven days or face further action.' Fine: Darilyn Rothwell (left) has been fined because her son Chris (right) missed school when he was suddenly hospitalised with a brain tumour in 2005. He is now 24 and a father of three . The Courts and Tribunal Service, which is responsible for the collection of fines ordered by courts in the UK, said today it was looking into whether the order had been made in error. A spokesman said: 'We are investigating this incident as a matter of urgency. The family have been advised no further action will be taken until our investigation has concluded.' Parents of children who persistently truant can be fined, ordered to do community service or even jailed. The numbers of parents prosecuted has risen from under 4,000 in 2005 to 12,800 in 2011 as the Government has cracked down on truancy. This year the Government introduced on-the-spot fines of £60 - rising to £120 if they fail to pay on time - to parents whose children miss school. Department of Education figures suggest around 43,000 pupils fail to attend school on any given day. Around 7 per cent of schoolchildren, the equivalent of 450,000 pupils, missed around a month of lessons in 2010-11.","Darilyn Rothwell, 53, has been fined for her son's absence in November 2004 .

The swallows were sunning themselves in Teesside. The bees collected nectar in Devon. And if you listened very carefully you could hear grasshoppers rubbing their legs together in South-West London. With just six weeks to go before Christmas, Britain was basking in temperatures this weekend – and experiencing sights and sounds – more associated with May. But, the optimism was short-lived as . sunshine and blue skies turned to damp mist and fog, reducing visibility . across much of the country. After a glorious weekend, the morning commute was rather a lot more gloomy this morning as a damp mist reduced visibility . St Paul's cathedral could barely be seen this morning before the thick mist eventually lifted . There wasn't much of a view from the top of the London Eye this morning as visibility was reduced to little more than a couple of hundred metres . Only Northern Ireland and the coast along North West Scotland escaped the gloomy start to the week, although temperatures there struggled to reach 10c. Forecasters are still saying that this November is on . course to be the most temperate since records began 353 years ago after . temperatures reached 18c (65f) at the weekend. The mild weather is expected to . continue today and throughout this week, with the Met Office predicting . highs of 15c (59f) in the South and 11c (52f) in the North.

November peaks of 9.5c (49f), summer flowers, insects and birds were . seen still out across the country. The mercury was within 3c of the UK’s . highest ever recorded this late in the year – 20.7c (69f) at Aber, . North Wales, on November 17, 1997. In contrast, Hamah, Syria, saw just . 9c yesterday, with even holiday hot-spot Corfu at only 16c (61f). Charlie Powell, Met Office forecaster, said: ‘We have got an air flow . coming from the South-East which has brought up some relatively mild . weather from countries on the continent such as France and Germany. ‘It’s unusual that the temperatures . have been higher than average for such a prolonged time.

Meanwhile, frogs who usually reserve their croaking for months between May and June, are being heard a month before Christmas. He added: 'These are sounds really more associated with when they breed, they are normally more vocal in May and June.' The mild weather has seen several sightings of a higher wildlife count with Rutland Water reserve in Leicestershire, welcoming more than 30,000 birds as a result of the better temperatures. While strawberries have been spotted fruiting near Oxford and tomatoes ripening in gardens in north London.","Unseasonably warm weather plays havoc with wildlife .

Parents are turning their daughters into ‘little princesses’ who can’t take criticism, the head teacher of a leading girls’ grammar school warned yesterday. Nicole Chapman said some families treat daughters as if they ‘can do no wrong’ and constantly shower them with praise and presents, . As a result, many lack the ‘resilience’ to deal with failure or criticism, she said. Mrs Chapman, who is head of one of the best selective schools in the country, spoke out ahead of a conference at her school in Chelmsford, Essex - attended by parents and other school leaders - about educating teenage girls. ‘What I try to address with my parents here is the concept of what we call the little princess, which is one where a child, once she’s satisfied her parents’ ambitions to get into the school, she can do no wrong,’ she said, . ‘She’s constantly praised - and that is not necessarily a good thing.’ Mrs Chapman, who has a grown-up son, said that ‘the little princess’ always wants to please and gets ‘a lot of rewards’ for her troubles. She said: ‘For some of them it’s just praise, but with others they can have more or less what they want. ‘Their parents shower them with presents.’ She said some parents ‘never exposed’ their daughters to any negative feedback. This made girls into ‘perfectionists’ who would not take risks in case they failed. Instead . of excessive praise, she said, parents should ensure their daughters . were ‘strong individuals’ who could cope with failure and grow up to be . leaders. ‘Our girls are bright and therefore, they will be leaders,’ she said. ‘As a leader, you’re not a princess. As a leader, you’ve got to have strength, belief, resilience. ‘You have to have the right principles - you must be principled, but you must have knowledge. ‘All those things don’t necessarily go with being a princess because a princess is a bit fragile. ‘A princess receives information, learns it, regurgitates it, but never gets truly challenged.’ 'Perfectionists': Mrs Chapman said some parents have 'never exposed' their daughters to risk meaning they are afraid of failure (file photo) Mrs Chapman is head of the 900-pupil Chelmsford County High School for Girls, where 88 per cent of pupils pass their GCSEs with As or A*s last summer. Her comments were echoed by Dr JoAnn Deak, author of Girls Will Be Girls: Raising Confident and Courageous Daughters. Speaking at the conference yesterday, . she said many parents ‘tend to go overboard on praise’, making girls . ‘feel precious’ and that they’re ‘the centre of the universe’. Praise should be ‘specific and earned’ instead, she said. Referring . to daughters, the American psychologist said: ‘As a parent, you’ll . obviously offer general praise to her sometimes, but if you do it too . often, your opinion will not be valued. ‘Remember . too, that the more she focuses on self, the more selfish she will . become; whereas the more she focuses on doing and on others, the more . she will increase her self esteem.’ Conference: The comments by Mrs Chapman came ahead of a conference at her school in Chelmsford, Essex, about educating teenage girls . Earlier this month a leading psychologist warned that praising children with phrases such as ‘well done darling’ could damage their confidence. Stephen Grosz says ‘empty praise’ such as ‘you’re so clever’ or ‘you’re such an artist’ could cause children to be unhappy as they feel they cannot live up to the false expectations, and can even hinder their progress at school. Mr Grosz - who has practised as a psychoanalyst, a type of psychologist, for 25 years - cites research showing that children who were heavily praised were likely to perform worse in maths problems and even tended to lie about their results. Instead he advises parents and teachers to bestow compliments less frequently and use phrases that congratulate children for ‘trying really hard’.","Nicole Chapman, head of leading girls' grammar school, says some families treat daughters as if they 'can do no wrong'

Contaminant: Westminster Council has removed a food supplier after it was discovered that pork DNA was discovered in Halal chicken sausages that were eaten by pupils. File picture . Pork DNA has been found in Halal chicken sausages that have been served in at least one primary school, Westminster Council said today. Other tests revealed that lean minced beef supplied to the council showed evidence of lamb and pork DNA. The council said it immediately ensured both items were removed from all school menus and had instructed its contractor to temporarily cease supplying meat until the issue was resolved. The consumption of pork is forbidden under Islamic law. Westminster City Council have named the school involved as St Mary’s Bryanston Square, a Church of England school in west London. In the meantime, the council said it had asked its contractor to no longer use its Halal meat supplier. The problem came to light after the authority decided to carry out its own proactive tests on food contamination in the wake of the horse meat scandal. The council said officers took seven samples in total from three schools in the week beginning February 25, adding that the tests 'were carried out on our own initiative and not carried out as the result of any specific concerns about school food standards'. The testing, which involved analysis for the presence of DNA from beef, lamb, pork, chicken, turkey, goat and horse, all proved negative for horse DNA. However, a preliminary report received on Friday suggested pig DNA could be present in the Halal chicken sausages range. The result was found in one sample taken at a Westminster primary school. A further round of tests today confirmed the preliminary findings. The Halal sausages were a menu choice in 15 primary schools, two nurseries, one special school and one pupil referral unit, all of which took Halal-only meat. The lean minced beef was used in 18 schools. The authority said it had launched its own investigation to establish how the contamination arose. Westminster City Council’s tri-borough director of children’s services Andrew Christie said: 'We are very concerned by the discovery that a contractor has fallen short of the high standards we demand. St Mary's Bryanston Square Primary School, where the chicken Halal sausages containing pork DNA were served . We also understand and regret the upset that may have been caused to parents and children alike. We are contacting schools, parents and faith group leaders and are offering to meet them to discuss their concerns. 'Westminster City Council took prompt action when this issue came to light and immediately ensured this product stopped being served in the schools in question. We have asked our contractor Chartwells to no longer use the meat supplier involved. 'The discovery of pork in these sausages came about because of extra tests Westminster City Council decided to carry out. The results were all the more shocking given the assurances about the food we receive from our suppliers. Other tests revealed that lean minced beef supplied to Westminster Council showed evidence of lamb and pork DNA. File picture . 'I can assure parents we will keep testing our school meals.' The council said it alerted the Food Standards Agency on March 11 in accordance with the usual protocols for incidents of this kind. A Defra spokesperson said: 'It is totally unacceptable if food labelled as Halal has been found to contain pork. 'Today Defra, the Food Standards Agency, and DCLG met with organisations involved in Halal and Kosher food to discuss labelling, and certification. Tesco Everyday Value beefburgers were removed after it was discovered they contained horse meat . 'Food manufacturers and suppliers have a responsibility to make sure that the food they serve is what they say it is. The FSA is working with Westminster City Council to establish what happened.' Last month the Ministry of Justice suspended a prison meat supplier after it was discovered that Halal pies and pasties may have contained traces of pork DNA. Aldi has withdrawn its Oakhurst Frozen Meatloaf after it was found to contain horse meat . The meat had been sourced from a properly Halal certificated caterer, however an investigation showed that the products could have contained traces of non-Halal meat, including pork. In a separate development, supermarket chain Aldi said a random sample of its Oakhurst Frozen Meatloaf had been found to contain horse meat. An Aldi spokesman said: 'Aldi has been contacted by the FSA to alert us that a random sample of our Oakhurst Frozen Meatloaf tested by a local authority has been found to contain horse meat. 'We are surprised and deeply disappointed at this news. Our DNA testing, carried out last month in accordance with FSA guidance, also tested samples of this product and found it to be clear of horse meat. 'The product is not part of our main range of everyday products and was stocked on a limited availability basis. However, we have immediately withdrawn any of the remaining stock from our stores. 'We will continue to test products and if we have any reason to believe the meat content is not correct, we will continue to act immediately in the interests of our customers. 'Customers can return the frozen meatloaf to their nearest Aldi for a full refund.' A number of revelations about contaminated meat products has emerged since the recent scandal over horsemeat contamination. Tesco was forced to issue a public apology earlier in January after tests in Ireland discovered traces of horse meat in three frozen beefburger lines. Scandal: A UK lab testing beef products says that nine out of 15 samples in one batch contained horse, as well as lamb, chicken and pork in a scandal linked to abattoirs like this one in Romania . The findings sparked a national outcry and 10 million burgers were pulled from shelves as a result of the scandal. Other supermarkets and major brands were also discovered to have horse DNA in their products and it soon emerged that horsemeat had been served to children in school meal cottage pies. It was also revealed that some hospitals have been serving patients burgers which contain horse passed off as beef. And the Whitbread chain announced that burgers and lasagne served at its Beefeater, Brewers Fayre, Table Table, Taybarns and Premier Inn hotels were contaminated. Abbatoirs in Romania were found to be one of the main sources of the horse meat in supermarkets.","Westminster Council confirmed pork was found in the sausages .

Sting: Emails showing how councils are delighted when there's an increase in the number of parking fines dished out . Damning evidence of how councils use CCTV cameras to ‘sting’ motorists with unfair fines to raise extra cash is revealed today. Emails expose officials’ delight that rising numbers of traffic fines are being issued, with one saying: ‘Another record month, guys. Well done.’ Hundreds of the documents were released to a motoring campaigner under the Freedom of Information Act and will be screened tonight in an investigation by BBC1’s Panorama. They show how surveillance cameras are catching out cars performing U-turns and being stuck in box junctions as part of a ‘target-based, revenue-raising culture’. The programme highlights Britain’s most notorious yellow box junction, which has been dubbed ‘the money box’ for raking in £2.7million a year by trapping and photographing up to 40,000 drivers before sending them a £130 fine in the post. Motoring groups say such tactics ‘verge on entrapment’ and fear they will spread across Britain. The programme obtained hundreds of emails between employees at the London Borough of Hammersmith & Fulham which show staff being congratulated on increasing the number of fines. Among the comments in the emails are: ‘Another record month, guys. Well done’; ‘Another increase ... holidays, as expected, bring back the traffic’; ‘Another good month last month. That’s despite the systems problems we had. So well done to everyone.’ A note to the head of parking services about the council’s procurement of specialist ‘close circuit TV equipment’ says: ‘Aim of project: To increase parking revenue (target: additional £5m.)’ The council said the email was from a management trainee temporarily seconded to the council and ‘wrongly’ suggested the aim was to raise revenue. Other messages between traffic officials reveal dismay that not enough cash is being raised from traffic and parking fines. Big business: Councils are using CCTV to catch motorists performing u-turns and getting stuck in box junctions to raise revenue . One notes: ‘A worrying start as Penalty Charge Notices seemed to reduce.’ Another adds: ‘We may get a negative hit on the U-turn tickets for this month.’ Panorama says the council is ‘exploiting a sophisticated new camera system to fine motorists for moving traffic offences, such as stopping in a yellow box junction or making a banned turn’. No cash cow: Hammersmith and Fulham Council has denied issuing tickets to raise money . Critics say the ‘money box’ junction, controlled by traffic lights at the intersection Bagley’s Lane and New Kings Road, is badly signed and designed. Only four spaces are available for cars leaving the junction, so drivers can easily get trapped in the box and fined £130. Researchers who put up clearer warning signs at the junction recorded a 25 per cent fall in cars getting stuck – before being told by the council to remove the signs. The council has spent £500,000 installing a round-the-clock camera system called Zengrab which spots errant motorists automatically. Motoring groups fear that more drivers will suffer because more than 20 cash-strapped councils have lobbied ministers for extra powers – currently available only in London – to fine motorists for a range of 26 moving traffic offences. Solicitor Jeanette Miller, a specialist in motoring law, tells Panorama that the Hammersmith & Fulham emails ‘indicate to me that this local authority is motivated primarily by revenue raising’. Professor Stephen Glaister of the RAC Foundation said: ‘You could understand if drivers thought this behaviour verged on entrapment. Councils have a legal obligation to keep traffic moving. ‘Bulging bank balances, swollen by penalty charges, should not be viewed with pride but as a sign that something is wrong with the way traffic is managed.’ Hammersmith & Fulham denied issuing tickets to raise money and described the emails as ‘office banter’.

Attics and garages all over Britain are likely to be filled with dust covered boxes of them. But museum curators have made an appeal for members of the public to contribute their old Airfix models and kits after an exhibition due to open at the Royal Air Force museum has been left with gaps. The exhibition, which is due to open in June, will document the history of Airfix dating back to its advent in 1939. Curators are appealing for members of the public to contribute their Airfix models to complete the exhibition . Kits still in their boxes are also being sought to be included in the Royal Airforce Museum exhibition, which opens in June . But the museum has a shortage of certain types of Airfix toys from the 1950s and 1960s which it is hoped members of the public can fill by donating their models, either fully built or still in boxes. The missing items in particular include the first Spitfire, the first Massey Ferguson Tractor, the HMS Endeavour and a Hawker P1127. Also sought after are figures from the historical characters range, including Joan of Arc, Henry VIII, Oliver Cromwell and Charles I. The company was launched in 1939 by Hungarian Nicholas Kove. The small-scale Golden Hind model first went on sale in Woolworths in 1952. The first Spitfire - one of the company's most popular models - went on sale in 1953. During the 1970s Airfix was selling 20 million kits a year. In the 1980s the toys began to decline and the firm was bought by General Mills, who later sold it to Borden. In 1995 Airfix was sold to Allen McGuire and in 2006 it was bought by trainset toy company, Hornby. Curators are mainly looking for perfectly built items in mint condition, but are also seeking one or two more clumsy attempts to feature in the collection. Andrew Cormack, the curator of the exhibition, told the Sunday Times: 'It would be interesting to get a few examples of models made by eight-year-olds who were shockingly proud of them, but which were actually dreadful. 'We would like to make a feature of some for the huge enjoyment people got from making their own toy. Anything and everything is of interest.' The company is assisting in the search, but as the ownership has changed many times over the years there are gaps in some of the ranges needed for the exhibition. Appeals have been made in vain to model clubs but the curators are hoping members of the public will be able to fill the void.","Gaps remain in museum Airfix collection from 1950s and 1960s .

Armed officers found the pair bleeding heavily after being called to Willenhall Street in Newport, South Wales, at 8.45 this morning, Gwent Police said. Witnesses said a red car pulled up, the gunman, 49, got out, fired at his former partner, said to be a mother, from less than 10ft and then shot himself. The first man on the scene of the Newport shooting told how the victim had been hit in the chest and the gunman then 'blew half his face off'. Scroll down for video . Crime scene: Police speak to drivers passing the spot where an estranged husband is alleged to have shot his former partner in Newport,South Wales . The woman may have been hit twice and 15 seconds later the assailant then shot himself once. They were both taken to the city’s Royal Gwent Hospital with serious injures. The woman was pronounced dead at around 1pm. A doctor from a nearby GP surgery had risked his own life by running out to help the pair. Witnesses also said her new boyfriend was one of the first on the scene and was taken away by police. Probe: Police were told by witnesses that three shots were fired in total, two at the woman and one by the gunman on himself . Dog walker Sam Williams, 33, raised the alarm after hearing a shotgun being fired three times.He said: 'The man had shot her before turning the gun on himself. 'He hadn't done a very good job of it - half his face was missing. But he was still conscious and moaning. 'He . is a big man with a crew cut and there was a single barrelled shot gun . lying next to him and I could see spent cartridges on the floor. 'I could see an entry wound in her chest. I shouted to her but she didn't respond. 'She was gone, her eyes were rolled back into her head. 'I just stayed with them until the police arrived. 'I have seen them both driving around. She was an attractive woman in her mid-30s. 'Both their cars were parked on the side of the road, they had their boots open but I'm not sure why.

'Can't rule it out': Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said he could foresee convicts gaining a role . Convicted hackers could be signed up to a new government cyber unit despite their criminal past, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond admitted. He said convictions will be acknowledged but for candidates that get past the vetting process, 'I can’t rule it out'. The head of the new team - branded a 'British FBI' - Lieutenant Colonel Michael White, said he refuses to set 'hard and fast rules about individual personality traits'. The Joint Cyber Reserve Unit will protect Britain against online attacks. The recruited hackers will also have the authority to strike at enemies. Heads of the new unit will have 'considerable . flexibility' in recruiting criteria, without the same constraints required for other defence departments such as infantry reservists. Asked by BBC2’s Newsnight whether someone with the right skills would be ruled out if they had a criminal record for hacking, Lt Col White said: 'I think if they could get through the security process, then if they had that capability that we would like, then if the vetting authority was happy with that, why not? 'We’re looking at capability development, rather than setting hard and fast rules about individual personality traits.' Mr Hammond also told the show he could foresee circumstances in which convicted hackers could be given a role. 'Each individual case would be looked at on its merits,' he said. 'The conviction would be examined in terms of how long ago it was, how serious it was, what sort of sentence had followed. So I can’t rule it out.' The new cyber unit - Britain's FBI - will protect against online attacks and have the power to strike enemies . He added: 'There are many professional people out there who will have the skills that you might traditionally associate with the hackers’ skill set who have never done anything illegal and who scrupulously maintain their activities on the right side of the law. 'So this will be a matter of judgment in individual cases. But the armed forces overall do not have an absolute bar on people with criminal convictions becoming members of them.' The 'routine' would be for them to wear uniform but if they were carrying out work away from the public eye 'they may not always do so'. Mr Hammond said: 'What we are trying to do is recruit the very brightest and the best from across the IT industry and use the skill sets they have got in the national interest to enhance our cyber defences and to help us build an offensive cyber capability.'","Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said 'can't rule out' employing criminals .

A whistleblower arrested after revealing the excessive expenses of a Police Crime Commissioner has been told she will not face criminal charges because what she did was ‘in the public interest’. But the police worker, aged 50, who has been suspended from work for five months, still faces disciplinary procedures to determine whether she can keep her job. She was arrested after a local newspaper published details of two chauffeur-driven trips taken by Cumbria PCC Richard Rhodes. He had billed the taxpayer £700 for the rides – and it was only after the disclosure that he apologised and said he would pay the money back. Despite this, the woman was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office and a breach of the data protection act. Those found guilty of these offences commonly draw prison sentences of a year or more. Yesterday, prosecutors announced they were dropping the case because any alleged leak would have been ‘in the public interest’. Crown Prosecution lawyer Simon Orme said: ‘To rely on this defence, an individual is required to establish on the balance of probabilities that the disclosure was in the public interest. Investigation: The newspaper that was alerted, the Cumberland and Westmorland Herald (whose offices are pictured), called Mr Rhodes's office to check the details of his expenses . ‘In my view, given the nature and circumstances of the disclosure, the suspect would be in a position to do so and, therefore, there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction.’ Charges against a further person accused of helping to facilitate the leak have already been dropped. Another person who was accused of perverting the course of justice will also escape prosecution. The scandal broke in April after Mr Rhodes spent £700 going to two dinners in the county in a hired Mercedes with a driver. The trips cost the taxpayer £385 and £313. Mr Rhodes has always maintained he did not realise how much the trips had cost and decided to pay the money back once he was told. He has said that in the future he would use his £23,000 Hyundai crossover – another taxpayer-funded perk. MPs from all parties have condemned the police inquiry that followed after the newspaper that was alerted, the Cumberland and Westmorland Herald, called Mr Rhodes’s office to check the details of his expenses. Happy: MP Tim Farron said the news vindicates 'that these people are whistleblowers and not criminals' Yesterday Liberal Democrat MP Tim Farron said: ‘This is good news and vindicates what I and others have been saying for months – that these people are whistleblowers and not criminals. 'The police have spent a huge amount of money and time on this investigation while disrupting the lives and careers of a number of people with arrests.’ 'This is good news and vindicates what I and others have been saying for months – that these people are whistleblowers and not criminals' Tim Farron, Liberal Democrat MP . He added that ‘questions should be asked about why the force spent so much time and resources’ on the case. Cumbria county councillor Helen Fearon, who is on the police and crime panel which is supposed to scrutinise the actions of the commissioner, said she would be raising the ‘disproportionate’ actions of the police at the next meeting. She added: ‘We have had conflicting statements about the involvement of the Commissioner and his staff in these investigations.’ A spokesman for Cumbria Police said its ‘staff and police officers have a duty to protect and manage the information they have privileged access to. Any allegations relating to a breach of this position need to be investigated’.","Police worker, 50, has been suspended from work for five months .

Germany's Bild newspaper reported today how U.S. intelligence services bugged a conference call between leading operatives of the terror group behind the 9/11 outrages as they discussed bringing death and destruction to the European rail network. The group was possibly targeting trains and tunnels, or planning to sabotage railway tracks themselves and the electric cabling serving them. Bugged: The conference call involved Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, seen in a 2006 file photo, and 20 other operatives, according to reports . The newspaper said the planned terrorist attacks were a 'central topic' of a conference call intercepted by the NSA involving high-ranking Al-Qaeda operatives. According to other media reports, Deutsche Bahn - German Rail - has already responded to the threat with plain clothed police officers at main stations and along major routes serviced by the high-speed ICE - Inter City Express - trains. The conference call involving Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri and some 20 of the group's operatives was intercepted by the National Security Agency. Deutsche Bahn: The German rail firm is said to have introduced plain clothes police officers across the network in response to the threats . On August 1, the US issued a worldwide alert about a terror plot in the Middle East or Africa, prompting the closure of 19 US embassies. U.S. allies, including Germany, closed diplomatic buildings for almost two weeks. Only Spain has baggage screening for its high-speed Targa trains: Deutsche Bahn and SNCF in France have no such measures in place. With security ever more difficult to circumvent at international aiports, Al-Qaeda plotters believe strikes on railways would yield enomrous casualties and strike fear into hated Allies of America.

An Ontario university student has taken it upon himself to heal broken hearts - one song at a time . Kyle Forgeard, a Ryerson University film student, filmed by Elliott Slater who is studying film at Toronto Film School, enters packed university lecture theaters, singles out a girl and begins singing to her at the top of his lungs. During the serenade he hands the bewildered girl a flower before leaving the lecture grinning ear to ear and generally to rapturous applause and laughter. Scroll down for video . College sweethearts: Forgeard and his accompanist Niko Martinovik in a surprise mid-lecture serenade . Unexpected: This lecturer is surprised to find herself the recipient of a mid-class love-song . Sweet rewards: The boys score chocolate bars for their efforts . Forgeard and Slater's first video, featuring Forgeard singing acapella the 'cheesiest' love-songs he can find, quickly racked up 75,000 views in a week and now stands at almost 300,000. For the next video, they added an acoustic guitar accompaniment by Niko Martinovic. Dressed like he's going to church on Sunday with a white shirt tucked into black pants and a tie, Forgeard strides into packed lectures halls and starts belting out boy-band standards. Lecturers, cut off mid-sentence, look at the interlopers askance. Young women seated in the first row watch with bemused looks as the singing young man approaches, flower in hand, before it dawns that the performance is aimed at them and they are generally simultaneously embarrassed, amused and confused. In one packed lecture theater at McMaster University, the whole front row receives yellow flowers, which couldn't fail to melt even the most angst-ridden college girl's heart. At the University of Guelph the boys' reputations seem to have preceded them, as the lecture hall begins tittering as soon as they hear the opening strains of acoustic guitar. Tough crowd: Some people are less enchanted with Forgeard's singing than others . Front row: With one notable exception, the girls in this lecture's front row seem to have enjoyed Forgeard's efforts . In one lecture, Forgeard finishes up his love-song to a university student and begins to leave the lecture theater before turning back and serenading the stern-looking lecturer with John Mayer's Your Body is a Wonderland which has both the lecturer and students in stitches. At the University of Toronto Mississauga, a female lecturer who is serenaded is so touched she offers both young men chocolate bars for their efforts. One professor who clearly believes in love from Guelph University holds his lapel microphone in front of Foregeard as he sings to amplify his dulcet tones. 'We didn’t think the professors would be so cool about it,' Forgeard told The Star. 'We thought some would [tell us to] get out and would tell us not to disturb the lecture.' And while professors and students alike seem delighted by the unexpected mid-lecture music break, some university officials are less than pleased about the interruptions. 'We value the time of our faculty and our students, and must oppose activities that disrupt teaching and learning, however briefly, for purposes of entertainment,' Amy Mullin, vice-principal academic and dean of the University of Toronto Mississauga told The Star via email. 'We also cannot endorse having our students or faculty singled out for attention, possibly quite unwelcome, in the context of a love song when they are supposed instead to be teaching or learning,' she said. Students do not agree with this attitude, though. 'It definitely made my day,' Elizabeth Thomlinson told The Star. 'Who doesn’t want a guy singing to her?' Hilarity: The student sitting in front of the girl Forgeard is singing to is amazed by the unexpected turn of events . Amplified: This lecturer lends his microphone to Forgeard .

According to The Star, the pair have been making videos together since ninth grade. Their YouTube channel, NelkFilmz, has received thousands of hits since they posted their university serenades.

The 'remarkable' bloom has been caught on a satellite camera based 400 miles above Earth. It is thought to have occurred when snow was blown into the ocean from Antarctica. The mammoth growth was probably caused by a build-up of iron which came from the snow falling into the waters, according to Australian scientists who spotted the bloom on satellite images. 'Remarkable': The blooms of bright green algae floating in ocean waters off Antarctica are so large they can be seen from space . Phenomenon: The images were captured from the Modis instrument on Nasa's Terra satellite, located at least 400 miles from Earth . They say the phenomenon could be the largest growth in living memory and it has caused a feeding . frenzy for the surrounding sea life. Krill and plankton are feasting on the algae and, in turn, they are being eaten by larger predators such as whales, penguins and seals, it has been reported. According to the Telegraph, scientists say Antarctica's snow, which contains small concentrations of iron, were blown into the sea by strong winds in the region over the summer. Dr Mark Curran, from the Australian Antarctic Division, told ABC Radio: 'Very, very tiny amounts of iron act as a nutrient. 'Usually algae in this region are . iron limited and so when they get a small amount of iron and they have . everything else they need, that's enough for them to bloom. 'They die off, things like bacteria . comes through there and feeds on the material and then the material . eventually will sink to the bottom of the ocean - anything that hasn't . been consumed by predators higher up the food chain.' Blown away: The algae is thought to have occurred after high winds pushed snow into the ocean from Antarctica (pictured) In bloom: Tiny amounts of iron act as a nutrient which allows algae to form and thrive . Feeding frenzy: Penguins and seals are just a few of the sea life feasting in the area thanks to the algae . The images were captured from the Modis instrument on Nasa's Terra satellite, located at least 400 miles from Earth. This particular bloom of algae has been floating on the ocean's surface for three weeks but it is likely to disappear soon, with the parts that haven't been eaten breaking down naturally without any negative impact on the environment. Describing the phenomenon as a 'remarkable natural event', scientist Dr Jan Leiser, told The Conversation website: 'Iron is the limiting nutrient in that part of the world, so as soon as you have iron and as soon as you have sunlight and all the other conditions are right, then these algal blooms will quite happily grow and reproduce. 'Where the iron is coming from we're not quite sure. One idea is that it's been taken off the continent by strong offshore winds that take snow and sediment load in the snow into the ocean surface, and the snow melts there and releases the nutrient load.'","'Remarkable' bloom caused by iron in snow blown across from Antarctica .

She is pictured (right) after her second operation in September 2011 in Uganda . Since then Trinny has lost sight in one eye due to the swelling and her teeth are being pushed out of place. Fibrous dysplasia is a rare bone disease that destroys and replaces normal bone with fibrous (scar-like) tissue. As the bone grows, the softer, fibrous tissue expands, weakening the bone and making it more prone to fractures. One or more bones can be affected and it can vary in severity. Mild cases usually cause no signs or symptoms and develops during the teens. More-serious cases of fibrous dysplasia may result in bone pain and deformity and are more common in under-10s. There is no cure for fibrous dysplasia. Treatment focuses on treating signs and symptoms. The bone lesions may stop when the child reaches puberty.NIH/Mayo Clinic .

Bolster support: British Foreign Secretary William Hague has urged support for moderate opponent groups of the Assad regime, and has called on them to create a united front . Moderate opponents of Syria's Assad regime need international support to form a united front if they are to outnumber extremist rebels, the UK's foreign secretary has said. William Hague has urged moderate opponents to come together to have a 'united position' ahead of the planned Geneva II negotiations next month. He has warned that while disparate opposition groups remain independent, the strength of extremist groups fighting Assad will grow. Mr Hague is meeting today with foreign ministers from 11 Western and Arab powers in London, to discuss how they can support the moderate opposition in the run-up to next month's peace conference in Switzerland. The talks are aimed at putting an end to the brutal war which has ravaged the country and its people since 2011 and created hundreds of thousands of refugees. The main Western-backed opposition umbrella group, the Syrian National Coalition, is scheduled to meet in the coming weeks to decide whether to take part in the Geneva summit. One of the most prominent factions within the coalition, the Syrian National Council, has said it has no faith in negotiations with the Assad regime and will not be part of the Geneva process. However Mr Hague warned that the longer the conflict went on, the more the position of the extremist groups fighting Assad's forces would be strengthened. 'Syrians on all sides now need to make the effort and make the compromises necessary for a peace process to work,' Mr Hague told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. The British Foreign Secretary is meeting today with 11 foreign ministers from Europe and the Middle East to discuss their support for the moderate fighters.

Negotiating: US Secretary of State John Kerry, second left, pictured speaking to Syrian National Coalition President Ahmed al-Jarba, second from right, at the U.S. Ambassador's residence in London today. Kerry has refused to back Assad in any way . 'The longer this conflict goes on, the more sectarian it becomes, the more extremists are able to take hold. That is why we are making this renewed effort to get a Geneva peace process going. 'I am in no way glossing over or minimising the danger of extremism taking hold. There are people fighting for extreme groups, not necessarily because of extreme views, but because that gives them access to weapons and training and so on - all the more reason why we have to help the moderate opposition in Syria.' Mr Hague also raised the prospect that Iran - one of Assad's few remaining allies in the region - could take part in the Geneva talks, as long as it was prepared to accept the need for political transition. 'It is important that Iran plays a more constructive role. I have discussed the situation in Syria with the new Iranian foreign minister,' Mr Hague said. 'If they are serious, of course it is helpful to have all outside powers involved in this, but that depends on them coming on a common basis of trying to achieve a peaceful settlement on the basis of a transitional government in Syria. Fighting continues across the North African country while chemical weapons inspectors mandated by the UN work to destroy Assad's arsenal of chemical weapons . A suicide bomber detonated a truck packed with one-and-a-half tons of explosives in Hama, Syria, on Sunday. At least 30 people, mostly civilians, were killed . 'That's the position of Russia and . it's the position of all of us among the West and among Arab nations. It . should be the position of Iran as well.' The . countries in the 'London 11', the core group of the Friends of Syria, . are also trying to shift the focus back to the humanitarian crisis after . weeks of international attention on Assad's chemical weapons stockpile. Representatives of the Syrian National Coalition's leadership are attending, along with ministers from the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. Speaking at the end of today's meeting, Mr Hague said: 'The only sustainable way to end this conflict and the suffering of Syrian civilians is through a political transition. During today's meeting the 11 . attending countries have all agreed to continue to provide 'intensive . political and practical support' to the Syrian National Coalition, an . umbrella group for moderate armed forces seeking the overthrow of . President Bashar Assad, said Mr Hague, who hosted the meeting at the . Foreign Office. Mr Hague . said that, before the talks open in Switzerland, the UK will announce a . further package of support for the SNC, whose president Ahmed Jarba . attended today's gathering. British support will include 'substantial' non-lethal supplies such as communications, medical and logistical . equipment, said the Foreign Secretary. 'There . can be no peaceful and political solution in Syria without the . participation of a moderate opposition,' said Mr Hague. 'We pledged our . further support to them.' And he added: 'It is important that we don't abandon them, we keep faith with them. 'Through . the Geneva II process, we will be with them every step of the way, . giving them the support they need as well as the practical and . administrative support needed to carry out such a negotiation.' Mr . Hague said that the Friends of Syria were not making it a precondition . of the Geneva talks that Assad can have no part in the political future . of his country, but he made clear that he does not expect there to be a . place for him in any transitional administration. 'The purpose of our meeting today has been to send a signal of our resolve, our unity and our determination in bringing that about.' The Friends of Syria group agreed to 'put our united and collective weight behind the UN-led Geneva II process which must lead to establishing by mutual consent a transitional governing body with full executive powers', as set out following earlier talks in the Swiss city in June 2012, said the Foreign Secretary. 'By definition, mutual consent means it can only be agreed with the assent of the SNC, so Assad would play no role in that future government of Syria,' he added. Mr Hague said: 'Geneva offers the Syrian people the best hope to improve their lives. 'We agreed that we will provide the intensive political and practical support that will be required to give the Geneva II process the best chance of success.' Mr Hague said that the Assad regime was continuing to use 'disproportionate force' in response to the uprising, much of it directed at civilians. The regime was 'laying siege to desperate people and presiding over a humanitarian catastrophe, with people under siege and people starving', he said. He warned of a 'deepening humanitarian disaster' and called on the regime to allow 'full and uninhibited access to people in humanitarian need'. He acknowledged that the Geneva II process faced 'immense difficulties', but warned that unless moderate forces were supported, the country would be left at the mercy of either Assad or extremist jihadists who have latched onto the conflict. 'The alternative (to Geneva II) is a protracted conflict in which neither side will be able to achieve a military victory over the other,' said Mr Hague.","Foreign Minister says moderates must join together to overcome extremists .

Ms O’Mara moved on when the £3,000-a-month home was closed by healthcare firm Southern Cross in 2011. But . just a few months ago she was appointed a regional director for Care UK, which has taken over Orchid View and re-named it Francis Court, which meant she was left in charge of the home. Ms O'Mara has now left her position at the company after Care UK conducted a review following the inquest last week. On . her LinkedIn profile Ms O’Mara boasted of a 'consistent record of . improving quality care delivery' and 'sound commercial judgement . delivering profit-driven results'. But . the inquest heard call bells were often not answered for long periods . or could not be reached by elderly people living at the home. A five-week investigation heard about hundreds of medical errors at the under-staffed Orchid View care home . The care home's acting manager Alison Paris told the inquest she never saw Ms O'Mara, who did not answer or return calls . Acting manager Alison Paris told the inquest she never saw Ms O’Mara, who did not answer or return calls. The . Care Quality Commission said it was 'appalling and disgraceful' that . residents were not supported by nurses and managers at the home. And one inspector said conditions were worse than anything she had seen in her 28-year career. Giving evidence, Ms O’Mara denied claims she did not make enough visits to Orchid View. But the coroner said: 'I haven’t heard you take responsibility at all.' Ms O’Mara replied: 'I was their manager. I supported whenever I was needed and went to the homes when I was needed.' The coroner ruled abuse and neglect contributed to the deaths of Enid Trodden (left) and Jean Halfpenny (right) The coroner also ruled abuse and neglect contributed to the death of Wilfred Gardner . West . Sussex Coroner Penelope Schofield concluded: 'There was . institutionalised abuse throughout the home which started at a very . early stage. Nobody did anything about it. 'This . was from the top down. It was completely mismanaged and under-staffed . and failed to provide a safe environment for residents. 'It is disgraceful that it was allowed to run the way it did for nearly two years. Whistleblower Lisa Martin, who worked as an administrator at the home, was asked to shred forms after one of the patients had to be admitted to hospital for bleeding . 'What concerns me is that many of those involved are still working in a similar role in the industry. 'Sadly this means there could be another Orchid View somewhere else.' The coroner said 19 residents at Orchid View suffered 'sub-optimal' care and all of those residents died from natural causes. But the coroner ruled that abuse and . neglect contributed to the deaths of Jean Halfpenny, 77, Wilfred . Gardner, 85, Margaret Tucker, 77, Enid Trodden, 86, and John Holmes, 85. Healthcare campaigners  criticised Ms O’Mara’s re-appointment. Ian Christian, of Irwin Mitchell solicitors which represented seven residents' families, said: 'The management void within Southern Cross was shocking and something that cannot be allowed to happen again. 'When someone in Sarah O’Mara’s position can fall so far below what’s expected and walk into another job it shows a woeful gap in the regulation of the industry.' Barry Pickthall, of disability campaign group Don’t Cut Us Out, added: 'I just despair at the lack of managerial control. It’s just extraordinary.' Ron Harley, Unison regional manager, said: 'It’s not appropriate that a senior manager should continue in her role until there’s been a full investigation into the allegations. 'If Care UK were sensible and serious about this they would not allow her to stay in a position of responsibility for such vulnerable adults.' A Care UK spokesman Ms O'Mara and another employee, Mark Cash, were no longer working for the company following a review into the coroner's findings. The spokesman said: 'Care UK initiated a review into the Coroner’s findings immediately after the inquest concluded on Friday, to address in particular any observations by the Coroner that concern the conduct of any of Care UK’s current employees who were previously involved in the Southern Cross management structure responsible for the Orchid View home. 'What concerns me is that many of those involved are still working in a similar role in the industry. Sadly this means there could be another Orchid View somewhere else' - West Sussex Coroner Penelope Schofield . 'Subsequently, both Sarah O’Mara, . appointed by Care UK as a regional manager in July 2013, and Mark Cash, . appointed by Care UK in March 2013 as a regional operations director, . have left the company.  Neither now works for Care UK.' The inquest heard resident Jean Halfpenny overdosed on the blood thinning drug warfarin after staff failed to monitor and administer her medication properly. Whistleblower Lisa Martin, who worked as an administrator at the home, was asked to shred forms after Mrs Halfpenny had to be admitted to hospital for bleeding. The 'final straw' for Ms Martin came when she was told by a nurse that they had found 28 drug errors from just one night shift. She called police who arrived the next day. Five people were arrested, including some on suspicion of manslaughter by gross negligence, but insufficient evidence existed to support a prosecution and the case was passed to the coroner.","Sarah O'Mara was criticised at inquest into deaths at Orchid View .

The duo - who like street artist Banksy shun the limelight - create their huge murals on the walls of buildings around London for the public to enjoy, using only a ladder, spray paint and the light of the moon. The finished pieces include a giant blue pigeon in London Fields, a large fox in Haringey and a super-size squirrel complete with a nut in Tottenham. Pigeon street: This mural in Ada Street, London, is one of a number by artists who have detailed British animals . An anonymous pair of artists have been working under the cover of darkness to brighten up the streets of London with incredible works of art - including this giant blue pigeon in London Fields . Just like Banksy, the duo known as Boe and Irony remain anonymous, creating their artworks using spraypaint on the sides of buildings for the public to enjoy. This snarling fox appeared in Haringey . The duo, known only as Boe and Irony, have said they prefer to remain anonymous, shunning the notion of 'celebrity'. They reportedly met when they both left a party early to go painting, and have worked together ever since. In a recent interview with the Guardian . they said that painting for the street is not like painting for a . gallery where people 'come to hear what you say.' They said street work was inflicted on an audience 'whether they want to see it or not'. They added: 'So . you start off with something people can generally accept, like a fluffy . kitten, that’s your foot in the door, then you can start actually . trying to say something with the piece.'

The pair create their huge murals using only a ladder, spray paint and the light of the moon . They have refused to say where they will 'strike yet' adding that that would ruin the surprise. In May a giant Banksy, with an estimated value of £1million, was removed from the side of a crumbling Grade II listed building. The giant rat, which was created by Britain's most famous street artist, had been eroding for years, with large parts having peeled off with the plaster or vanished on rotted wood. A special restoration team was drafted in to remove the painting from the old Whitehorse pub in Liverpool's China town as part of plans to re-open the building. Bristol-born Banksy daubed the huge rat wielding a machine gun on the Georgian building in Berry Street as part of Liverpool's Biennial art programme in 2004Banksy has since conquered the art world, selling his unique pieces for millions, and counts Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie amongst his fans. Boe and Irony said the artist was partly responsible for the increased popularity in street art. They added: 'Banksy’s financial success has made people feel more comfortable about street art. People are cool with anything once it’s been assigned a cash value.'","Duo known as Boe and Irony take to streets at night armed with spray paint .

Everyone knows it takes more than talent alone to become a successful athlete. The professionals who make it to the top of their game and go down in the history books spend countless hours in repetitive training sessions and pound pavements with obsessive determination. But a Manchester-born 24-year-old has bucked the trend with his speedy rise to the top of American Football. After just two years after taking up American football and with only 20 games under his belt, he has been selected to be Oakland Raiders' offensive tackle. Watson is now one of the highest-rated young players in America - worlds away from his impoverished upbringing on the tough streets of Longsight, Manchester. Watson told BBC Sport that he . remembers being so hungry as a child that, when accompanying his mum on a cleaning . job, he helped himself to ketchup in the canteen. The self-confessed 'mummy's boy' said he will be sending the first paycheck from his million dollar contract, to his mother Novlyn in Manchester. 'I owe it to her, more than anybody else in the world, to do . something positive and see her smile. That's my motivation,' he told BBC Sport. Watson said his mother raised four boys and two girls single-handed and said that although times were tough, she always showed him love and support. 'My mum had to raise us by herself; she had no opportunities and no options and there was not much she could do,' he said. 'I've always been close to my mum,' he . said. 'She had four boys, was by herself and many times could have . walked out and left us. 'She struggled, even when my brothers were . getting into trouble, my mum always showed us love.' Watson put his impoverished past behind him by starting his lucrative ascent to American football stardom aged 17. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Menelik Watson (left) grew up in Longsight, Manchester, where his single mother struggled to make ends meet. Watson's sporting abilities took him away from England where his brother is serving a prison sentence . The 24-year-old will be the least experienced man on his team. He started playing American Football in 2011 after training to be a professional basketball player . Watson says being raised in tough conditions by a single mother made him more determined to pursue his dream job . It was rough,' he said. 'I think that . side of England does not get publicised; everyone thinks it is all roses . and it's not. If it was not for basketball, I would not have even . visited other parts of England. He was scouted during a basketball game in Manchester in 2006 and moved to the Canary Islands to train. He was given a basketball scholarship in the U.S. but it was not until he tried American football in 2011 that his career took off. Watson says it took being rejected by professional basketball scouts to find his calling in American Football. At 6ft 5in and 22st, he was considered too small to become a professional basketball forward, but impressed American Football coaches with his speed and power. Florida State coach Rick Trickett said that in his 41 years of coaching, Menelik is the most explosive man that he has coached. Watson (right) left a life of poverty in Manchester behind when he moved to Canary Islands in 2006 . Waston's rise to success was threatened by an ankle injury that almost put a stop to his career. He said he wouldn't let his fractured and dislocated ankle get in the way of his dreams for a better life. 'They [doctors] were telling me I shouldn't play sport again.' 'It was pretty gruesome.

Naming a child can be hard enough with so many old and new names going in and out of fashion. Now a new tool shows how trends in girls' names have swept across the US over the decades. This fascinating map illustrates how some names will stand the test of time, while others are short-lived trends - here today but gone tomorrow. Trendy: New mothers and fathers can check out which girls' names are the most popular in their state and across the US with this time-lapse map . The clever tool shows how some names, such as Lisa and Jennifer have stood the test of time and swept across the entire country in popularity . Remarkably, it also illustrates how some parts of the US are the trend-setters, coming up with a new favourite girls' name, which then spread like wildfire across neighbouring states, and sometimes even across the entire United States. From 1960 until 2012, the most popular girls name in each state are easily identified by the colour, while all other names are monochrome. Tennessee and Kentucky, in the mid-East, frequently buck the trend. These two states opted for Amanda over Jennifer in the mid-1970s, ending a decade dedicated to a love for the name Jennifer. Not all names were adopted from East to West, with trends often spanning a cluster of neighbouring states . Jessica, like Jennifer a few years earlier, showed it was a strong girls' name that stood the test of time, clinging on for years in some states, disappearing but then coming back again . They then also adopt Ashley, which spread almost entirely across the US in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Perhaps one of the traditionalist states is Utah, which began the Jennifer affair in 1969. It went on to be the most popular girls' baby name throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. The name Madison originates in the West, in Utah, in 1996. It's picked up two years later in neighbouring states before it travels like a plague across the south-east and other pockets for a few years. Madison's eventually pushed out in favour of Emma and Emily. Ava, Isabella and Sophia are some of the most popular recent baby names today the US. Sometimes, names were only popular for a short period of time in just one or two states, like Brittany on the East coast . The baby names map was created by Reuben Fischer-Baum, of Deadspin sports news service, using data from the Social Security Administration. After some trial and errors with colours Mr Fischer-Baum decided it was 'cleaner and more interesting to limit the palette to just the most popular name for any given year, and put the rest in greyscale so you coud se how the different eras of tops names progressed,' he is quoted in The Atlantic. The baby naming trend data was made available by one curious father in 1997 who didn't want to name his child a common name. According to the Boston Globe, Michael Shackleford wrote a simple programme to sort rank popular baby names, as listed on Social Security data, against year and gender. His program gave the results of the most popular boys' and girls' names. Both the north west and south east regions appear to be trend-setters, often the first states to break away from a traditional name and start a new trend, such as Hannah . Ava, Isabella, traditional name Emma and Sophia are some of the most popular baby names for girls today .","Some names have stood the test of time while others are a brief-lived trend .

Twitter account: Father-of-one Derek Larkin, 32, was found dead in a barn in Slaughterford, Wiltshire . A prestigious stud yard assistant manager hanged himself after being outed as the author of a Twitter account parodying the Queen’s racing manager, an inquest heard today. Derek Larkin, 32, was found dead in a barn in Slaughterford, Wiltshire, just days after an anonymous source accused him of creating the spoof feed poking fun at John Warren. The profile had been active for around a year and posted regular jokes about the racing world along with quips about celebrities and the Royal Family, the inquest in Salisbury was told. It also made light of the claimed ‘self-importance’ of Mr Warren, who regularly entertains the Queen at his Highclere Stud in Berkshire. Father-of-one Mr Larkin, who ran the account with financier friend James Morgan, had become increasingly ‘frantic’ following an anonymous email naming him as the Twitter account holder. Despite assurances from his employers, and the promise of legal help, Mr Larkin feared he would lose his job and family and he hanged himself. Speaking after the inquest, his 39-year-old wife Laura said Mr Larkin took his life to ‘save his family from the shame he thought he had brought upon himself and the stud he worked at’. She added: ‘Following a sequence of events that cost my husband’s life I know Derek took his life in the misguided belief we would all be better off without him. ‘He felt he had let us all down, this was the only way he could see to save his family from the shame, he thought, he had brought upon himself and the stud he worked at. 'Always in our hearts': Mr Larkin's 39-year-old wife Laura said after the inquest that her husband took his life to 'save his family from the shame he thought he had brought upon himself and the stud he worked at' ‘However, misguided it was a pure act of love and care on his part. We will never forget Derek and will always miss him. He will always be in our hearts and his legacy lives on in his darling daughter.’ The email naming Mr Larkin was sent to a number of high profile members in the racing community in late March last year. Mr Larkin, the assistant manager of Biddestone Stud, in Chippenham, initially denied being involved in the account and ran to managers to clear his name of any involvement. Traumatic: When Mr Larkin failed to come home a number of people went out to search for him. His father Dennis and mother Kathleen are pictured . But despite their support and belief in him, as more and more emails began to filter through he because increasingly stressed. The inquest heard he told close friend Mr Morgan he would lose ‘his job, his wife and his home’ as a result. Mr Morgan, a bloodstock manager for Capital Bloodstock Investments, told the inquest: ‘He texted me very early in the morning saying “I have been rumbled” and that was it. ‘I asked him what happened and he said someone had told a couple of agents it was him behind the account. It was really worrying him. He had never been like this before, this was frantic.’ The inquest heard Mr Larkin continued to deny all involvement in the account and rang Mr Morgan multiple times over the following days, each time getting more and more agitated. ‘He thought he was going to lose his job, his wife and his home,’ he added. ‘He wanted me to clear his name. I told him he needed to come clean and that I was going to come clean with him. ‘I offered to come down to Biddestone to take it with him but he refused.’ But the inquest was told he failed to confess and instead, under the impression he had let his family down, went to a remote barn and hanged himself. The inquest was told that Mr Larkin also made many visits to his manager Ian Bradbury after the initial email - sent from an untraceable French vet - emerged. Target: Queen Elizabeth II and her racing manager John Warren react after her horse, Estimate, won the Gold Cup on day three of Royal Ascot earlier this year in June. The spoof feed poked fun at Mr Warren . Mr Bradbury told the hearing: ‘He was very upset, he denied everything and said it was nothing to do with him. ‘I said his best option was to go to managing director of the stud Tim Bostwick to explain the situation, which he did on his own.’ 'Derek took his life in the misguided belief we would all be better off without him' Laura Larkin, his widow . The manager also offered Irish-born Mr Larkin the option of a lawyer to talk his situation through, but Mr Larkin refused. Just two days later, on April 3, Mr Larkin was called into a meeting with Mr Bradbury, Mr Bostwick and wife Gill, and a lawyer where he again denied any involvement. But after it emerged another email had been sent to Mr Larkin, from Morgan’s employers, implicating him further in the scandal, the meeting became heated and finished abruptly - where Mr Larkin stormed off. Mr Larkin returned home to see his wife where he finally revealed that he had been partly responsible for the spoof account. Behind the account: Despite assurances from his employers, and the promise of legal help, Mr Larkin feared he would lose his job and family and he hanged himself . Laura told the inquest: ‘He came home barely able to talk to me, his mouth was very dry and he had little expression. He just came in and said “I have got the sack, I am going to lose my job”. ‘He said that what he had told me about the Lord John Warren account was a lie and that he had been involved in it. 'I don’t think we will ever understand what truly went on in Derek’s head and why he felt the need to do what he did' Coroner David Ridley . ‘He said that he was not the person running it, that that was James Morgan, and that he knew he shouldn’t have done it. Then he just said, “I have to go, I have to go”.’ But when Mr Larkin failed to come home his wife became worried and a number of people went out to search for her husband. He was eventually discovered four hours later, hanging in a barn in the next village of Slaughterford, by friend Peter Gooding. Coroner David Ridley, recording that Derek took his own life, said: ‘At some point after 4pm on April 3, 2013, Derek drove to a remote farm building and hanged himself. ‘I am sure the appropriate conclusion is that he took his own life. I don’t think we will ever understand what truly went on in Derek’s head and why he felt the need to do what he did.’","Derek Larkin, 32, found dead in a barn in Slaughterford, Wiltshire .

Roman Abramovich plans to knock three houses together to create a £100m home . Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich has won a three-year battle with planners for permission to upgrade his £100million Thames-side home. The 46-year-old tycoon aims to start work immediately linking the 17th century house to two adjacent properties. His £10million plan to refurbish the mansion has been met with fury from neighbours who have described the proposal's approval as 'bad news'. Estimates put the likely date for completion of the scheme to be at . least three years away, but Chelsea Football Club owner Abramovich and . his family will be elsewhere in London, far from the din as well as the . uprooting of many trees on what was once an estate owned by Thomas More. After months of a bitter planning battle with locals, Abramovich — . acting behind the little-known Acmonious Investments — has been told . that Kensington And Chelsea Council has decided to grant ‘conditional . permission’ to develop the Grade II-listed building, once owned by the . artist James Whistler and, more recently home to late Tory minister Paul . Channon. One of the chief objectors, who fears the renovation will blot out views . of the Thames and create a chaotic building site, has informed other . disgruntled residents: ‘It seems that basically the whole proposal will . be approved. This is probably bad news for all of us.’ Particularly hard-hit will be residents of nearby apartments, whose . complaints about losing their views of the Thames were airily dismissed . in the committee’s report. Plans submitted to Kensington and Chelsea Council show the size of the planned basement - the dotted lines show the footprint of the building at ground level . There will be a sub-basement (solid line) under part of the main basement . In answer to the objectors, the planners said: ‘There is no right to a view in planning legislation. ‘The proposed development would protect the appearance of the building, . would preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area and . preserve the special architectural and historic interest of the listed . building.’ Part of the building will be converted into an art studio to house artwork he has bought with his partner Dasha Zhukova . One member of the residents' committee said: 'The battle may be lost, . but the war is far from over. We are not going to accept all this lying . down and hope that some of the main preservation groups will get on side . when they see how genuine protest is being ridden over roughshod.’ The Chelsea Football Club owner decided to make the house in Chelsea his home after failing to gain permission to build an eight-bedroom house in nearby Belgravia. His staff said yesterday that he aims to start work on the refurbishment project immediately after winning approval from Kensington & Chelsea Council's planning committee. His new home is in a street where Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger owns a house. Fellow band member Keith Richards has also lived in the street. The businessman aims to excavate beneath the Grade II-listed house, which was once home to artist James Whistler, to create a two-storey basement. He is also going to convert part of the building into an art studio to house his collection of valuable modern paintings that he has bought along with his 31-year-old partner, Dasha Zhukova. He has only won permission for the project after making a series of compromises, which were forced on him by neighbours anxious at possible loss of light and increased traffic. One opponent, Dr Richard Clarke, . warned the venture was 'totally out of character with the surrounding . buildings on this famous historic site.' He added: 'It will be an unsightly fortress-like building, spoiling the outlook for neighbours.' The red parts of the drawing show parts of the building that will be demolished as part of the plan . The view of Cheyne Walk where Mr Abramovich intends to live from across the River Thames . Another neighbour Christopher Walker, said the scheme would 'severely damage the character and look of the house.' But Mr Abramovich's architects promised planning officials the renovation would turn the property into 'a beautiful and meaningful contemporary home'. He and his wife and three-year-old son Aaron are currently living in a Kensington house they own. Three years ago, the businessman bought two adjacent buildings in Lowndes Square, London and revealed he aimed to turn them into a single eight-bedroom home. But he had to abandon this venture as part of the complex was National Trust-owned and because of time delays. Among his neighbours is Mick Jagger (left) while late Tory MP Paul Channon used to live in one of the houses .","Given permission to build home after three-year battle with planners .

Russian breast-feeding expert Zhanna Tsaregradskaya was arrested by police who claim her pre-natal centre is a 'sect' (stock image) A Russian breast-feeding expert has been arrested on suspicion of being a cult leader, it has emerged. Zhanna Tsaregradskaya, director of the Rozhana Centre, in Kaluga, near Moscow, was detained by the country's counter-extremism police claiming the pre-natal facility was 'a sect with a strict hierarchical structure,' TIME reported. While breast feeding is encouraged in the west, it is contrary to common practise in Soviet and Russian medicine. The centre, which was established in 1989 and helped re-introduce home births in Russia, offers training courses for midwives and expectant mothers interested in having a home birth, its website states. Tsaregradskaya taught seminars on breast feeding and natural births at the centre. In their statement, released on Friday, police investigators revealed they have charged Tsaregradskaya on two counts - one of 'creating a non-commercial organisation that encroaches on the personalities and rights of citizens' and a second of 'the incitement of hatred and hostility'. If convicted of the charges, Tsaregradskaya faces up to seven years in prison. Investigators claim she 'steered mothers away from traditional principles'. The statement went on to say the centre's 'followers', thought to number 14, were taught to 'reject the family as a social institution, to act negatively toward their spouses (men), to refuse medical help, education, work and military service'. It said the centre used 'physical and psychological violence' to maintain control over its followers, teaching them disobedience towards the norms of society. Tsaregradskaya, who has been released pending her trial, did not respond to requests for comment from TIME. A co-ordinator at the centre did deny that any violence or 'brainwashing' was used in their training courses. 'We provide free phone consultations to mothers who are having trouble breast-feeding, or who simply want to know more about it,' the co-ordinator told TIME. 'We have no idea why our director has been singled out like this. 'We can’t figure out why there’s this witch hunt now. Maybe it’s just a fear of the unfamiliar,' said the woman called Anna, who declined to give her surname because she was not authorised to speak to the press. She said the hotline will function as normal and no police officers have come to shut them down. In 2010 the Rozhana Centre faced legal problems, when a dozen disgruntled clients visited the live-in facilty in Kaluga to retrieve property they claimed to have left. Police statements and media reports said Tsaregradskaya accused them of failing to pay. When they insisted on being allowed inside, her husband fired shots at them with a 'traumatic pistol,' a gun sold widely in Russia. Two of the husbands of the centre's clients were injured. Police closed the facility and last year Tsaregradskaya's husband Andrei was jailed for five years for assault. On Friday, the lawyer who defended Mr Tsaregradskaya's victims, Alina Pokrovskaya, appeared on Russian television. She said: 'There is a great demand among women to organise natural births, because these methods have been lost in our country. 'Unfortunately, even our grandmothers have lost this know-how. And our doctors do not accommodate such needs.' Under the Soviet Union child birth was the sole responsibility of state-run clinics. Midwives and private clinics were not permitted to deliver babies. The state-operated clinics encouraged mothers to use baby formula instead of breast milk. When the Soviet Union collapsed in the early 1990s, natural births, dieting and other health care trends began to flood in from the west. The Rozhana Centre was among the pioneers in the field and Tsaregradskaya often appeared on television to promote the benefits of breast feeding and natural birth.","Zhanna Tsaregradskaya is director of a pre-natal entre near Moscow .

Or they would have been in my day'. He said: 'She's having so much sex that she's going broke, she says... You're worried here that I'm just stepping in it deeper, yes you are but this is the truth.' On Friday three advertisers revealed they will pull all adverts from the radio show after the host had made fun of Ms Fluke for saying religious institutions should cover birth control in health insurance - and said in a further show that she should have to make sex tapes if this ever happens. Scroll down for audio clip . Rant: Rush Limbaugh, 61, left called Sandra Fluke, right, a student at Catholic college Georgetown University, a 'slut' for saying religious institutions should cover birth control under health insurance . Now mattress retailers Sleep Train . and Sleep Number, as well as mortgage lender QuickenLoans, have all . bowed to pressure on Twitter and said they will no longer advertise on . the show. And Barack Obama . has also weighed in to the row, describing the comment as . 'reprehensible' and calling student Sandra Fluke to discuss the . controversy. ‘We don't condone negative comments . directed toward any group,’ a Sleep Train spokesman tweeted. ‘Thanks to all of you . for your concern and input.’ 'Recent comments by Rush Limbaugh do not align with our values,' a Sleep Number spokesman said. 'So we made decision to immediately suspend all advertising on that program.' A QuickenLoans spokesman said: 'Due to continued inflammatory comments - along with valuable feedback from clients & team members - QL has suspended ads on Rush Limbaugh.' Meanwhile advertiser ProFlowers said it will . 're-evaluate’ its marketing plan and dating site eHarmony insisted it . will look into ‘the matter of 'network buys’. Mr Limbaugh said earlier this week that Ms Fluke, of Catholic college . Georgetown University in Washington D.C., was promiscuous for saying . woman should get the pill for medical reasons. And he went even further on his next show, saying: 'If we are going to pay for your contraceptives and thus pay for you to have sex... we want you to post the videos online so we can all watch.' In addition, Barack Obama said he considered Mr Limbaugh's remarks 'reprehensible' and called Ms Fluke to express his disappointment that she was the subject of 'inappropriate personal attacks'. 'He said he hoped my parents were proud of me,' Ms Fluke said, adding that the President 'thanked me for speaking out and for expressing the concerns of so many women'. Scroll down for audio clip .

Also angry: Another mattress company in Sleep Number also announced through a spokesman that they were 'immediately suspending' all advertising on the Rush Limbaugh show . Out: Quicken Loans also decided to pull advertising from the show after the 'inflammatory comments' 'The fact that our political discourse has become debased in many ways . is bad enough,' a White House spokesman said. 'It is worse when . it's directed at a private citizen simply expressing her . views.' More surprisingly, Mr Limbaugh has also faced criticism from the Republican presidential candidates, with Rick Santorum calling his comments 'absurd'. When Mitt Romney was asked what he thought about the remarks, he replied: 'I'll just say this, which is, it's not the language I would have used.' 'If we are going to pay for your contraceptives and thus pay for you to have sex... we want you to post the videos online so we can all watch' Rush Limbaugh . Mr Limbaugh . said on his original show regarding Ms Fluke's comments on birth . control: ‘What does that make her? It makes her a slut, right? It makes . her a prostitute. She wants . to be paid to have sex. ‘She's having so much sex she can't afford the contraception. She wants you and me and the taxpayers to pay her to have sex.’ Ms Fluke said on Friday that she has been left 'very upset' by the comments made by Mr Limbaugh. 'My reaction was the reaction . a lot of women have had historically when they’ve been called these . types of names,' she told MSNBC. 'Initially to be stunned by it, and then to quickly feel outraged and very upset.' Annoyed: President Barack Obama, seen on Friday, considers Mr Limbaugh's remarks 'reprehensible' and called Ms Fluke to express his disappointment that she was the subject of 'inappropriate personal attacks' Shock: Ms Fluke told MSNBC's Today show on Friday that she was 'stunned and outraged' by the comments . Ms Fluke was due to testify at a . hearing on Capitol Hill last month about Barack Obama's mandate that . health insurers provide contraception. The Senate yesterday defeated a GOP effort to roll back President Barack Obama's policy on contraception insurance coverage. It was the first vote on an issue that has raised controversy on religious and women's rights. The close 51-48 vote killed an amendment to allow employers and insurers to opt out of portions of the President's health care law they found morally objectionable. But committee chairman Darrell Issa of . California said she could not testify at the hearing as it was focused . on threats to religious freedom. Ms Fluke later put her testimony on . YouTube and spoke about a friend who had to take birth control to treat a . disorder that caused ovarian cysts. The friend subsequently lost her . ovary. She also spoke of classmates who can’t afford contraception, . which was what really riled Mr Limbaugh. Ms Fluke claimed a female student spends $3,000 on protected sex during a three-year course at university, reported ABC News. ‘Three thousand dollars for birth . control in three years? That’s $1,000 a year of sex - and, she wants us . to pay for it,’ Mr Limbaugh said. Spokesman: Ms Fluke was due to testify at a hearing on Capitol Hill last month about Barack Obama's mandate that health insurers provide contraception - but she wasn't allowed to do so . Another target: Mr Limbaugh also hit out at NASCAR driver Danica Patrick earlier this week on Monday for backing contraceptive insurance coverage . 'She's having so much sex she can't . afford her own birth control pills and she agrees that Obama should . provide them, or the Pope.’ Should U.S. university students' health insurance cover birth control costs? Female rights activists were left . seething and two Democrats walked out of the Capitol Hill hearing last . month after it was led by an all-male panel. Ms Fluke did eventually speak about . birth control at a Democratic hearing led by House Minority Leader Nancy . Pelosi last week, reported ABC News. She is a third-year law student at Georgetown and ex-president of the Students for Reproductive Justice group at the university. Mr Limbaugh also hit out at NASCAR driver Danica Patrick this week on Monday for backing contraceptive insurance coverage. But he has faced attacks of his own to . deal with this week - after a survey of American viewers found he was . their least-liked news personality. Bomb squad officials investigated Rush Limbaugh's home in South Florida on Thursday after hearing reports of a possible threat. The . apparent danger attracted extra attention on the day that the death of . his fellow conservative commentator Andrew Breitbart was announced. But . the item probed turned out to be an electronic plaque sent by a . listener of the host's programme as a 'business opportunity' for him.

"By . Paul Milligan . PUBLISHED: . 10:57 EST, 18 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:03 EST, 18 June 2013 . Senior members of the German government have warned EU member states that German car makers could scale back or scrap production plans in their countries unless they support weakened carbon emissions rules, according to diplomatic sources. With EU governments and lawmakers aiming to finalise the rules next week, which most of the 27 member states back, Germany has stepped up the pressure on them to water down limits on vehicle emissions to protect the country's mighty car industry, particularly luxury makers such as BMW and Daimler. The sources added that some calls warning EU member states of possible consequences have come from members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's office. German automakers like BMW (pictured here) could scale back production plans in the UK, France and Italy unless they support weakened carbon emissions rules . One EU diplomat said Berlin had reminded Lisbon of Portugal's 78 billion euro ($100 billion) euro zone bailout, which was heavily financed by Germany, in its bid to convince the country to drop its opposition to softer limits. 'They have tried everything at the highest level to pressure member states, in particular countries in the bailout club, to support their proposals,"" said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 'Germany seems hell-bent on pressing its interests. Even countries that are generally pro-German feel that they are going too far.' A German government source denied that Berlin had put particular pressure on countries that have received EU financial aid, and said its aim was to protect jobs in the EU auto sector. Most EU governments are backing the current legislation on car emissions, putting the Germans at odds with other countries in Europe . 'Our strategy is to focus on France, Britain and Italy as the big car producing countries, and on the countries which have important supply industries,' the source said. They should all be together in this fight. We should not drive jobs out of Europe at a moment of high unemployment.' Germany's position is backed by a handful of central European countries with domestic auto production, but France, Britain and Italy are opposed, EU sources say. The proposal from the European Commission, the EU's executive, would set a goal of 95 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre (g/km) as an average for all new vehicles sold in Europe from 2020. Each manufacturer is assigned an individual target to take account of the nature of their fleet and their record of past cuts. But making less-polluting cars is costly and restricts profit margins, which is why major German manufacturers want to delay the stricter rules. Germany wants the emissions targets reduced to protect luxury makers such as BMW and Daimler . The legal changes demanded by Berlin would allow luxury makers to continue selling more powerful - and profitable - models in Europe after 2020, when the new EU emission limits will take effect. Under the plan, car makers would be allowed to carry over credits to pollute that were accrued before the new rules kick in. Known as supercredits, these permits are earned if manufacturers make some very low emissions vehicles, such as electric cars, which German firms are making to meet a separate national target. The problem is that if they manage to hold on to a glut of supercredits, they can carry on making higher emissions models, and emissions levels will fail to meet the 2020 95 g/km target. Germany and its carmakers say the flexibility they want is essential for spurring innovation, but critics say the changes amount to major loopholes in the rules. An EU source said the German proposal would delay achievement of the 95 g/km target until 2023 for those carmakers who made use of the accrued credits. The United States has agreed fuel efficiency standards, though they lag Europe, while China, where smog has stirred social unrest, is increasingly aware of the implications of vehicle emissions for air pollution. In 2008, after dire predictions of factory closures and mass job losses, the European Union agreed a limit of 130 g/km to be phased in between 2012 and 2015.","Germany's luxury carmakers struggling to meet targets .

"By . Jenny Hope . PUBLISHED: . 20:16 EST, 12 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 15:08 EST, 13 December 2012 . Using a mobile while crossing the road could cost your life, warn researchers. Texting while crossing the road was the riskiest activity, making people four times more likely to ignore oncoming traffic and disobey the lights, according to a new study. Texters also took longer to cross the street at busy junctions. Almost one in three pedestrians were . using phones or doing something else distracting at the same time as . they were trying to cross the road. Danger: The University of Washington study found that those texting while crossing the road are four times more likely to ignore oncoming traffic . The findings come from a ‘real-time’ study of more than 1,000 pedestrians who were watched at busy road junctions, in the US city of Seattle. Study leader Dr Beth Ebel, of Harborview Injury Prevention & Research Center, University of Washington, said, like drink driving, there should be a ‘low tolerance’ approach to pedestrian behaviour that puts both them and others at risk of serious injury. She said ‘Some years ago no one would think twice about having a couple of drinks before getting in the car to drive home. ‘But today people know the risks and we have to get that same level of awareness in an era of growing distraction. ‘We may need advertising campaigns to get the message home’ she added. There is increasing concern about the near trance-like state people adopt while using mobile phones and MP3 players, which psychologists call ‘divided attention’ or ‘inattentional blindness’. It has become the focus for safety campaigners worried about safety on the roads and pavements, with some research suggesting serious accidents involving people wearing headphones while walking in the street have tripled. In the latest study 1,100 people were observed crossing 20 busy road junctions this summer at different times of the day, including the morning rush hour. The observers recorded ‘distracting’ activities, such as talking on the phone, text messaging, or listening to music on mobile devices, as well as talking to others or dealing with children or pets. Just under 30 per cent of pedestrians were doing something else when they crossed the road, says a report in the journal Injury Prevention (must credit). One in 10 were listening to music, seven per cent were texting; and six per cent were talking on the phone. Those who were distracted took significantly longer to cross the road - 0.75 to1.29 seconds longer. While listening to music speeded up the time taken to cross the road, those doing it were less likely to look both ways before doing so. People distracted by pets or children were almost three times as likely not to look both ways. Hazard: Using a mobile phone while driving is already an illegal offence but the study warns that using a phone as a pedestrian can be just as hazardous . But texting was potentially the most risky behaviour, as texters took almost two seconds (18 per cent) longer to cross the average junction of three to four lanes than those who weren’t texting at the time. They were also almost four times more likely to ignore lights, to cross at the middle of the junction, or fail to look both ways before stepping off the kerb. Dr Ebel said ‘Texters were four times less likely to cross the road safely, by looking both ways and obeying the lights. They took a constellation of risks of the kind that put people at high risk of being seriously injured.’ She said young teenagers and young adults were the biggest culprits. ‘The observers were student researchers and they were taken aback by what they were seeing. It made them think, and I believe schools should conduct this kind of exercise to make children aware of the risks of being distracted’ she said. Advertising campaigns similar to those getting people to obey the law and wear seatbelts might work, she said. But people who use mobiles are prey to ‘compulsive behaviour’ which is not necessarily rational, she said. ‘They may feel they are safer than other people while texting - they are capable of doing it while crossing the road. ‘The trouble is when the phone rings they answer it wherever they are, and don’t realise they need full concentration in a situation which is potentially dangerous’ she added.","People are four times more likely to ignore traffic and disobey lights if texting .

For Downton Abbey die-hards, submerging yourself in Julian Fellowes' world of lords, ladies and servants quarters must sound like a dream. And now it will be possible to emulate the make-up of The Dowager Countess of Grantham, and even smell like Lord Grantham, thanks to a new line of Downton Abbey-themed beauty products being launched by Marks & Spencer to celebrate the fourth series, to be screened on ITV in October. The phenomenally successful period . drama set in the aristocratic world of a post-Edwardian Yorkshire estate has seduced the nation . The Downton Abbey Fragranced Candle (£8.50) and the three-shade Lip Gloss collection (£9.50) The Downton products will allow people to emulate the look, and even the smell, of their favorite characters . Its heady combination of family and . class . narratives have provided a window into the world of luxury and glamour . upstairs, and the drudgery taking place downstairs. It has even been . successfully exported to the US. M&S hope that the 10-piece gift collection, which includes soaps, a scented candle, lipstick, crème bath and nail varnishes - will appeal to the thousands of fans who want to emulate the world of Lord and Lady Grantham and the Crawleys. The costumes and makeup of the Downton ladies like Lady Edith (left) and Mary (right) have become popular again, as women want to recreate the elegance of the period . Downton's steamy plot lines have kept its legions of fans hooked for three seasons, and anticipation is high for the fourth . And the products would not be out of place on Lady Mary's dresser or in a guest bathroom in the Abbey. While the world of Downton may be becoming more obtainable, the reality unfortunately never will. Downton Abbey itself is fictional, with Highclere Castle in Hampshire being used for the exterior building shots. Although you can visit this ancient building, you will find it looks very different from the Crawley family home inside. Most of the 'rooms' used for interior filming were constructed and filmed at Ealing Studios. Each bearing the Downton Arms, the packaging features delicate floral designs in . rich tones of gold, emerald and burgundy, capturing the ornate Downton . Abbey look and the classic elegance and charm of the Edwardian era. They also each feature an iconic image of . the Abbey and a quote from the series, such as 'I'd expect no less' on the Downton Abbey Guest . Soaps. There . is even a Downton Abbey cosmetic bag in the range, so you can hide . any historically incorrect items of your own out of sight. The . products themselves, however, are probably less historically accurate: . we doubt Lady Mary and Edith spent their evenings painting their nails. The products will be available at 250 . M&S stores across the nation and cost from £5 for the lip balm set - . £49.50 for the luxury collection set. The maker of Downton NBC Universal . has signed a two-year merchandising deal with M&S, so we will likely . see more Grantham based products on the shelves. Downton egg and cress sandwiches, anyone?

Dream come true: 'It's always been my dream growing up,' Hodskins, who's originally from Lexington, Kentucky, told ESPN this week . Hodskins was born without the lower half of his left arm but didn't let that stop him succeed on the basketball court. He was spotted last summer by an assistant coach with the Gators who was scouting another hopeful, Fox News reported. Being a 'preferred walk-on' means Hodskins will be guaranteed to make the roster, but will not receive a full scholarship. His incredible story of overcoming adversity has inspired the likes of Clippers guard JJ Redick and Beyonce. And even Michael Jordan tweeted about him after he revealed the good news. 'One-handed basketball player, Zach Hodskins, has committed to Florida! He is unreal! #MustSee,' the basketball legend tweeted. But he said he wants to prove his place on the team and not just be a feel-good story. 'I'm coming on as a preferred walk-on, but I'll be treated like every other player,' Hodskins said to ESPN. 'If I work hard, Coach Donovan told me I'll have a chance to play.' One YouTube video shows Hodskins hit jump shots in a high school gym and wow the crowd with his ball skills.

'So I got a serious face . and I told them that it got bitten off by a shark. The look on their . faces was priceless. I like that story; makes me sound tougher.'

Margaret Thatcher's spectacular ceremonial funeral cost the taxpayer just £1.2million, just a fraction of the sum claimed by left-wing opponents. The final bill for the ceremony at St Paul's Cathedral was revealed by ministers today in a rebuff to critics who suggested the costs would top £10million. Officials said that detailed work on the price of security, policing, staff over-time and hiring the Cathedral meant the total was much lower than early estimates suggested. National tribute: Prime Minister David Cameron gave a reading during the funeral service of Baroness Thatcher on April 17 . Venue: The bill for St Paul's Cathedral came to £67,908, the government revealed . In April the Cabinet Office published an early estimate of the funeral costs, which came to £3.6million. It included around £2million for policing by 4,000 officers who would have been on duty anyway. The new figure published today covers ‘marginal costs’ spent specifically on the funeral for Britain's first female Prime Minister, as opposed to spending on salaries and buildings which would have been incurred any way. On the morning of the funeral, Labour frontbencher Diane Abbott complained about the bill. 'There is just no precedent, it’s a breach of protocol and it’s going to cost £10million,' she claimed, in what now appears to be a vast overestimate. Tory MP Conor Burns, a close friend of Baroness Thatcher, said: 'Lady T would have been delighted that, even in death, she has proved the Left wrong.' The confirmed costs for organising the funeral were £261,976, including staff overtime, down from £500,000 estimated in April. It included £31,978 by the Cabinet Office, £7,000 by the City of London Corporation, £78,244 by the Foreign Office, £8,311 by the Greater London Authority and  £20,445 by the London Ambulance Service. Lady Thatcher had requested a strong military element to her funeral, in recognition of her victory in the Falklands War . Lady Thatcher's family led the mourners. Pictured left to right are Carol Thatcher and partner Marco Grass, Lady Sarah Thatcher and husband Sir Mark Thatcher and his two children Michael and Amanda . Lady Thatcher had requested a strong military element to her funeral, in recognition of her victory in the Falklands War. The Ministry of Defence spent £39,057 while the Houses of Parliament spent £1,700, Transport for London £1,000 and £6,333 by Westminster City Council. The breakdown of figures show St Paul’s Cathedral cost £67,908. The direct policing and security costs for the funeral came to £943,833, down from an estimate of £1.1million in April . The bulk of the bill came from £845,600 from the Met, while the British Transport Police spent £25,233 and City of London Police £73,000. Cabinet Office minister Lord Wallace said: ‘No public money was spent on the reception at the Guildhall, which was paid for by the City of London Corporation and not out of public funds. Friends of the Iron Lady said the ceremony was a fitting tribute to Britain's first female Prime Minister . ‘Further costs were met by Baroness Thatcher’s estate,’ he added in a statement to Parliament. More than 2,300 mourners joined Lady Thatcher's daughter Carol and son Mark at the ceremony. The Queen and Prince Philip broke with tradition to attend the funeral of a former Prime Minister for the first time since Winston Churchill. Baroness Thatcher was honoured with a sombre but spectacular funeral ceremony that paid tribute to the ‘courage and perseverance’ of Britain's greatest peacetime prime minister. Under the great dome of St Paul's Cathedral, the Queen joined dignitaries from 170 countries worldwide, friends, political foes and Lady Thatcher's closest family members to celebrate the life of the UK's first and only female premier. London's streets were also packed with mourners who broke into spontaneous applause and gave cheers and whistles of support as the coffin passed by. The emotional crowds threw white roses in the path of the gun carriage that carried Lady Thatcher through the capital, while many of the 2,300 inside St Paul's openly sobbed with Chancellor George Osborne 'overwhelmed'. Outside on the streets, the predicted protests and disorder failed to materialise, with the few boos drowned out by supporters' applause. As Big Ben once again started to chime after the 11am service, the procession started its final journey. Lady Thatcher's twins Sir Mark and Carol looked moved throughout and her grandchildren Michael and Amanda were waiting at the cathedral door holding cushions bearing the insignia of the Order of the Garter and the Order of Merit, which they then placed on the Dome Altar as the coffin arrived. Margaret Thatcher's only granddaughter Amanda also paid a heartfelt tribute to the former Prime Minister with a perfectly-delivered reading.","Cabinet Office releases breakdown for Iron Lady's ceremonial funeral .

An Iowa teenager smiled in court on Monday after pleading guilty to shooting dead his grandparents with a rifle before kissing their corpses and fleeing. Isaiah Sweet, 18, agreed to plead guilty to shooting dead Richard Sweet, 55, and Janet Sweet, 62, last year after his grandfather made his life a 'living hell' - and in exchange, all other charges against him were dropped. He faces life in prison at his sentencing in December but after pleading guilty, he will serve sentences for the murders concurrently. Sweet told the judge in Dubuque on Monday that he understood. Smile of a killer: Isaiah Sweet, 18, grins as he is escorted by sheriff officers after pleading guilty to shooting dead his grandparents in court in Dubuque, Iowa on Monday . The plea came after the prosecution played a two-hour video of Sweet's interview . with investigators after he was arrested on May 14, 2012, the Dubuque Times Herald reported. He explained that he had decided to kill his parents after his grandfather constantly put him down, told him he should kill himself and made the teen's life 'a living hell'. '[I] walked . up the stairs... had the earmuffs on and everything, stepped up until I . saw my grandpa's head, boom, pulled the trigger,' Sweet said in the interview. 'Pulled . the bolt back, shot my grandma twice in the head. 'I went up to . them, and I broke down and started crying. I told them how much I loved . them,' he said, adding that he kissed them both. 'I don’t know what's wrong with me.' In court: He said he understood that he faces a sentence of life in prison as he pleaded guilty on Monday . Anger: Sweet said that he killed his grandparents as his grandfather had made his life a 'living hell' He sobbed: 'I want to go back so bad.' Both were found slumped dead on their couch with wounds to the head. He then jumped in his grandfather's truck from their home in Manchester to Iowa City where he went to parties so he didn't think of the killings. Sweet told investigators he had tried to kill himself before murdering his grandparents and after their deaths, he tried to commit suicide every night by choking himself until he was caught. He was arrested three days later after a police chase. In the interview, he told investigators that he wanted police to shoot him when they found him. Murdered: He shot dead Richard and Janet Sweet, pictured, on their couch in May 2012. He said he had first considered poisoning his grandfather's beer and then beating him with a baseball bat . 'They didn’t deserve that,' Sweet said of the killings. 'If anyone in the house deserved that, I did.' Before pulling the trigger, he said he had considered other methods of how to kill his guardians. The teen thought about . poisoning his grandfather's beer. He decided to kill him with a bat but . couldn't go through with the swing because he didn't want his . grandparents to feel any pain. He eventually opted to use his grandfather's rifle. The tape and guilty plea came on the third day of testimony and had began with Judge Michael Shubatt rejecting a defense lawyer's request for a mistrial. Defense lawyer Jill Eimermann sought a . mistrial on Friday when a witness for the prosecution testified that he . found child pornography on a computer in the family home. Trial: Sgt. James Hauschild with the Manchester Police Department holds up a piece of a round fired from a rifle from the scene of the crime. Sweet said he used his grandfather's rifle in the murders . Testimony: Investigator Scott Regert gestures how Sweet described pointing and shooting the rifle. After the killings, the teen fled in his grandfather's truck but was found three days later . Shubatt acknowledged defense concerns the jury might think Isaiah Sweet accessed child pornography, but he decided the jury wouldn't put too much weight on the statement. As Sweet was 17 at the time of the murders, Shubatt ordered a sentencing hearing in which defense attorneys can present evidence to ask the court for a lesser time in prison. But Shubatt cautioned the teenager that he will still spend a significant amount of time in prison. His sentencing hearing is set December 18 in Delaware County Circuit Court.","Isaiah Sweet, 18, admitted killing Richard Sweet, 55, and Janet Sweet, 62, as they sat on their couch in Manchester, Iowa in May 2012 .

Bosses are more interested in hiring someone they fancy - or who will be good to hang out with - than the very best candidates, according to a new study. More than half of employers rate having the right looks, background and hobbies as the most important assets for applicants at job interviews. Sociologist Dr Lauren Rivera, an assistant professor of management and organisations, said: 'Of course employers are looking for people who have the baseline of skills to effectively do the job. Interview: Employers are more likely to hire someone that they find attractive according to a sociological study (picture posed by models) 'But, beyond that, employers really want people who they will bond with, who they will feel good around, who will be their friend and maybe even their romantic partner. 'As a result, employers don't necessarily hire the most skilled candidates.' The study published in the American Sociological Review is the first investigation of its kind into whether shared culture between employers and job candidates matters. It was based on 120 interviews with professionals involved in undergraduate and graduate hiring in elite US investment banks, law firms and management consulting companies as well as participant observation of a recruiting department. Dr Rivera found evaluators at firms often valued their personal feelings of comfort, acceptance and excitement above identifying candidates with superior cognitive or technical skills. In fact more than one-in-two ranked 'cultural fit' - the perceived similarity to a firm's existing employee base in leisure pursuits, background and self-presentation - as the most important criterion at the job interview stage. Dr Rivera, of Northwestern University in the United States, said: 'It is important to note this does not mean employers are hiring unqualified people. 'But my findings demonstrate that - in many respects - employers hire in a manner more closely resembling the choice of friends or romantic partners than how one might expect employers to select new workers. 'When you look at the decision to date or marry someone what you think about is commonalities. Do you have a similar level of education? Did you go to a similar calibre school? Do you enjoy similar activities? Are you excited to talk to each other? Do you feel the spark? 'These types of things are salient at least to the employers I've studied.' The study also found the cultural similarities valued at elite professional service firms have an impact on whether a candidate will be hired. Dr Rivera said: 'Evaluators are predominately white, Ivy League-educated, upper-middle or upper class men and women who tend to have more stereotypically masculine leisure pursuits and favour extracurricular activities associated with people of their background. Bond: Bosses are more likely to hire candidates with whom they share a social connection according to the study (picture posed by models) 'Given less affluent students are more likely to believe achievement in the classroom rather than on the field or in the concert hall matters most for future success and focus their energies accordingly, the types of cultural similarities valued in elite firms' hiring processes has the potential to create inequalities in access to elite jobs based on parental socioeconomic status."" She said the importance of cultural fit in hiring practices at elite professional service firms are probably present across other types of occupations to some extent. She said: 'I think the process is generalisable, but I think the degree to which cultural similarity matters in the decision to hire varies across occupations depending on their technical demands, their degree of social demands and how structured interviews are. 'So, for example, if you were hiring a neurosurgeon, I think there would be more of an emphasis on performance than cultural fit.' In addition the types of cultural similarities employers value may not be the same for all occupations. Dr Rivera said: 'Cultivating leisure time is a hallmark of the upper-middle and upper classes, and it's really important as a class marker and as a source of identity. 'You may see different types of cultural similarities that matter in occupations that are less elite.' She conducted the interviews - 40 per industry - from 2006 through 2008 and the fieldwork within the recruiting department of an elite professional service firm over nine months in 2006 and 2007.","Bosses are more interested in hiring someone they fancy or who will be good company than best candidate for the role, says an American sociologist .

Photographer Cinnamon Heathcote Drury, pictured leaving Isleworth Crown Court, denies racially aggravated assault . A portrait photographer to the stars shoved a pregnant Muslim woman to the floor  and called her a terrorist during a row in Tesco, a court  heard yesterday. Cinnamon Heathcote-Drury also branded the hijab-wearing woman’s family suicide bombers, it was alleged. The 41-year-old, who has 11 portraits hanging in the National Portrait Gallery including exhibits of London mayor Boris Johnson and Newsnight’s Jeremy Paxman, denies racially-aggravated assault. She told a jury at Isleworth Crown Court that trouble began at the Tesco store in Kensington, West London, when she offered to help the woman, Mounia Hamoumi, and her husband unload their shopping trolley. The court was told she had overheard the husband refusing to help his wife because he was too busy looking after their children. ‘I told him that is what feminism is all about, women helping women – and he told me to “get lost”,’ claimed Heathcote-Drury. But prosecutor Nermine Abdel Sayed said: ‘You took objection to that inequality didn’t you? Coupled with the woman wearing Islamic dress, you waded in and instigated the whole incident. ‘When your offer of help was rejected you became more confrontational and you very quickly lost control and were shouting at them. ‘Your tone was aggressive and you used the words “suicide bomber” and “terrorist”, and told them: “I am a British citizen. I don’t know where you are from.” ‘You went to the woman and pushed her.’ Mother-of-three Mrs Hamoumi was six months’ pregnant at the time of the incident which happened on November 30 last year. Heathcote-Drury is also accused of telling the family: ‘You’re probably claiming jobseeker’s [allowance].’ She denied this and using any racist language, and said she was the true victim. On trial: Isleworth Crown Court heard Heathcote Drury called a Muslim family 'terrorists' The photographer, whose portrait subjects also include actor Terence Stamp and ministers Kenneth Clarke and Iain  Duncan Smith, told the court: ‘Many of those words were made up, they have misheard it for their purpose.’ With tears in her eyes, she said: ‘I am the only one who was assaulted. I am the only one with injuries.’ Heathcote-Drury made an assault complaint to police, claiming she was tripped, kicked and punched by Mrs Hamoumi, but this was not pursued by the investigating officers. The prosecutor suggested: ‘You played the victim in order to get out of trouble, trying to direct attention on to them and away from you.’ A security guard broke up the row, but Heathcote-Drury is accused of then approaching Mrs Hamoumi and pushing her to the floor. Talented: Renowned photographer Cinnamon Heathcote Drury has eleven permanent portraits on display at the National Portrait Gallery . When arrested at the store, Heathcote-Drury is said to have proclaimed: ‘Unbelievable’, and told officers: ‘This is absolutely incorrect. I was the one who was verbally abused then assaulted.’ Giving her version of events to the jury, she said: ‘I said we live in a society in Great Britain where rights are equal and if you need help you can ask for it and she said: “Mind your own business.” ‘The husband came over and said: “You **** off”, then came over again and I thought he was going to jab me with something in his hand.’ She claimed she was tripped by the woman as she tried to get away from the row, saying: ‘I stumbled very badly forward and I felt a shooting pain in my left shin. The woman was looking at me and smiling. She had wished me to fall flat on my face to humiliate me. ‘She took a step forward and took a swipe at my head with her right fist and got me on  my right cheek.’ Heathcote-Drury, of West Kensington, has pleaded not guilty to racially aggravated assault. The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Photographer Cinnamon Heathcote Drury allegedly called a Muslim family 'terrorists'

Jailed: Oluwamayola Ajayi, pictured, conned a series of single women out of more than £120,000 using dating website match.com . An acclaimed gospel singer who used a dating site to steal more than £120,000 from lonely women by posing as a pilot, oil executive and grieving widower has been jailed for six-and-a-half years. Conman Oluwamayola Ajayi, 31, preyed on four single women on popular dating website Match.com using a series of aliases and outlandish stories to fleece them of their cash. He even sent email threats, purportedly from a captor, claiming he had been kidnapped and would be killed if a ransom was not paid. Ajayi, who was nominated for best international act at the 2011 Gospel Music Awards under his stage name MaioJoe, was jailed for conspiracy to defraud at Snaresbrook Crown Court with Judge Sarah Paneth saying that it was clear he intended to defraud his victims 'for much more money' than he did. He blew all the money on a luxury lifestyle, including a holiday to South Africa. Judge Paneth added: 'This was not money these women had to spare, it was money they needed back urgently. 'Having spent all of their money you pursued them for more by saying you would be killed if they did not pay.' The court heard how he gained the women’s trust before persuading them to hand over their savings to fund business enterprises insisting the cash would be repaid. His victims, who all live in America and Canada, were ‘completely taken in’ by his elaborate lies. They were left humiliated and some were financially ruined by the scam, which ran between November 2009 and August 2010. One victim handed over more than $125,000 (now £78,662) from her late husband’s life savings and dead mother’s estate, which she had earmarked for retirement. Another disabled woman from Nova Scotia was duped into giving Ajayi almost $38,000 (£23,913) after he pretended to be Travis David McFly, a United States Airforce pilot serving in Iraq. Prosecutor Markus Rickard said: ‘He told a story to her about some gold bars he had found and that he wanted to get them out of Iraq so they could secure their financial future. ‘This inevitably led to the woman having supply money via an intermediary in London, to enable the gold bars to be taken from Iraq. ‘She was completely taken in by him and intended to spend the rest of her life with him. ‘At one point, she arranged to meet him at an airport and waited for five hours for him, but he did not turn up. Conned: the women who were fleeced by Ajayi all used the popular dating website match.com . ‘This has left her flat broke and deeply embarrassed.’ Ajayi pocketed around $30,000 (£18,873) from another internet lover, leaving her in financial dire straits. The singer also posed as a project manager in the oil and gas industry to fleece $7,000 (£4,404) from his final victim, telling her he needed the cash for expenses including a ‘Crude Oil Lifting Licence’. Conman: Ajayi, pictured, used a string of identities including posing as a pilot, oil executive and grieving widower to fleece four women out of their cash . He told all but one of the women that he was a white widower with children from Britain called Mark West, who was currently living in the US. Ajayi funnelled his ill-gotten gains through false bank accounts, mainly using the fictional identity of Jose Fernando Rodrigues-Guedes. Mr Rickard added: ‘The defendant systematically and repeatedly misrepresented himself to lonely females using the internet and cheated them out of £120,000 from November 2009 until August 2010. ‘The victims of his deceptions have been left embarrassed and fearful and they have all suffered substantial financial loss or ruin.’ Ajayi was arrested last August at the home he shares with his wife in Chadwell Heath, Essex. During interview in a prepared statement, he insisted one of his victims was the girlfriend of a friend who owed him money. He claimed he used an account in the name of Rodrigues-Guedes as he did not have one in his own name. The computer equipment on which police found scores of emails with money transfers, credit card details, bank statements, personal information and photographs belonged to the ‘real’ Rodrigues-Guedes, Ajayi claimed. But Rodrigues-Guedes has never been found, prompting police to believe he is simply an identity dreamed up by Ajayi to carry out his con. Ajayi denied conspiracy to defraud, fraud, concealing criminal property, using criminal property and two counts of possessing articles for use in frauds. He was unanimously convicted by a jury on all counts after a trial after admitting a single count of possessing a false identity document with intent. A spokesman for match.com today urged users to follow its safety guidelines when online dating. He said: 'Sadly the tiny minority of people who try to exploit others is not confined to dating sites or even the internet, it’s across all walks of life. 'We urge our members to follow the safe dating guidance we provide across our site and via email when meeting new people, whether that’s online, through friends or in a bar. 'Most importantly requests for money or financial assistance are not acceptable.

A father who discovered his girlfriend was cheating on him battered their three-year-old daughter to death, a court heard today. Richard Green, 22, subjected Lia Green to 'significant physical abuse' after learning girlfriend Natalie Critchley was having an affair with a parent at a children's nursery where she worked, it was said. Lia was rushed to hospital in August last year after she was found unresponsive and not breathing. She died shortly after being admitted to the Royal Preston Hospital. Doctors . discovered Lia had a significant number of bruises to her neck, chest, . abdomen, both arms, both legs, buttocks and back caused by deliberate . blows. Part of her bowel had been completely severed. Green, who is on trial at Preston Crown Court,  denies murder and allowing the death of a child. His girlfriend is also accused of allowing the death of a child, which she denies. A post mortem found Lia died from a blunt force abdominal trauma injury. Lia was taken to the Royal Preston Hospital on August 30 with a swollen abdomen and was slightly stiff with dark, dry vomit around her nose and mouth. Doctors attempted to resuscitate her but she was already dead. Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, told the court: 'Richard Green and Natalie Critchley only contacted emergency services when they realised Lia's condition had deteriorated to such an extent that it could no longer be concealed. 'It's a sad feature of this case that had they acted more swiftly then Lia's life could have been saved but they chose to try to conceal what happened.' At the hospital Critchley's behaviour was described by nurses as 'strange' with her 'pre-occupied' with text messaging while her daughter lay dead in the treatment room. Father Richard Green is accused of killing his daughter after discovering girlfriend Natalie Critchley 'was having an affair' The court was told that in the run up . to Lia's death, Green was 'very upset and angry' and wrote messages on . his Facebook account about Critchley's 'affair'. Mr Wright told the court: 'We might say that Green found caring for the child was a considerable strain. 'It . would seem she was having an affair with a man who had a child at . nursery and in a period leading up to death of Lia we say there was . considerable friction between the parents. The relationship continued . but was far from harmonious. 'There . was simmering resentment. Resentment [that] was hardly helped with the . addition of looking after Lia. When Lia's body was examined her injuries . were not down to some freak or terrible accident but blunt force. 'We . say it was blindingly obvious that something extremely serious and dire . was likely to happen in that household and something extremely dire did . happen to Lia.' The court was told Lia was left in the care of Green after he pulled her out of nursery. In November 2011, Critchley, 20, started a full-time job as a nursery assistant at Small Wonders 2, while Green was unemployed. The court was told that a month before Lia's death, he rang her nursery and said his daughter would not be attending again. Mr Wright said: 'He informed the nursery that he had discovered that Natalie was seeing the parent of a child from the nursery and that Natalie would not be returning to work. 'He was clearly very upset by this discovery, angry with Natalie and made remarks on his Facebook account that were able to be read by others.' When Green was arrested he told police that the bruises on Lia's body was caused by her falling off a swing . Critchley received reassurance from her employer about her job but Lia was not allowed back to nursery due to unpaid fees. The . youngster was then left in the care of Green while her mother was at . work and on occasions was cared for by her grandmother or a nursery . colleague. Two weeks before her death, a social worker visited the family home following a referral but had no concerns for Lia's safety. On August 15, five days after the visit, nursery . manager Vicky Waterhouse received a text from Critchley, which appeared . to have been drafted by Green, implying all was not well between the . couple. Mr Wright said: 'On a visit she saw some damage to the wall of the premises Green admitted causing. 'Asked if okay he said ""no I'm not with her"".' The day before Lia was found dead, Green went to the nursery and was said to be 'mad and swearing'. He told the staff they had to send Ms Critchley home because Lia was being sick. Mr . Wright said: 'The assistant said he looked like a parent who couldn't . cope, they had never seen him like that shouting, swearing and raising . his voice.' The court heard . when Lia's body was examined doctors discovered trauma to her abdomen . that had been delivered with such force that causes extensive and fatal . internal injuries. Lia was found to be extensively bruised and many were less than 48 hours old and some were older. The court was told that the day before her death records showed the home computer had searched the NHS Direct website with the term: 'Three-year-old hurting head and being sick' and a local surgery called but it was closed. Green was arrested the next day but told officers his daughter had fallen while on swings at the park.Both he and Critchley deny any responsibility for their daughter's death. Doctors found Lia had bruises to her neck, chest, abdomen, arms, legs, buttocks and back . Mr . Wright said: 'This was a young child who had been physically abused. This was physical abuse where she ought to have been protected by her . parents rather than exposed. 'There . was a significant risk of harm being caused to Lia. It was a risk of . serious physical harm from which she ought to have been protected. 'Each of her parents failed to protect her from and led eventually to her death at the hands of we say the male defendant Richard Green. 'We say Green did not intentionally kill but at the time we say he must have delivered a forceful blow to the abdomen of the child. He must have intended to cause her really serious harm.' Lia was described as a 'normal, happy toddler' who just the day before her death was seen 'skipping' along the road with her father looking 'perfectly happy'. On July 30, one month before Lia's death, police made a referral to social services about Green smoking cannabis with children around. The home was visited and while conditions were 'less than perfect' there was food in the house and Lia had clean clothes on and there was nothing that caused concern to the social services department about the safety of the child, the court heard. Green was arrested the day after Lia's but told officers his daughter had fallen while on swings at the park. Both he and Critchley deny any responsibility for their daughter's death. Mr Wright told the jury that, irrespective of whose 'hand or fist or boot' delivered the fatal injury, it was 'blindingly obvious' something 'dire' was likely to happen in that household and should not have been allowed to happen. 'We say it would be obvious to any parent that their child was extremely unwell and in need of medical assistance. 'The fact that no medical assistance was obtained until it was too late speaks volumes in this case as to the responsibility of both parents in the events that led to Lia's death.' Russell Bennet, the first paramedic on the scene at the house, said he and a colleague got Lia into the ambulance to carry out chest compressions but the ECG monitor gave a 'flat-line' response showing the heart had stopped. Mr Bennet told the jury he asked Critchley how long she had been in this 'state'. 'She told us the child had been unwell recently, had been to see a GP and the child had been up and about and playing 10 to 15 minutes prior to the 999 call. 'My impression was the child had been deceased for longer than the 15 minutes we were told.' Green denies murder and allowing the death of a child and Critchley denies allowing the death of a child. The trial, scheduled to last up to six weeks, was adjourned until tomorrow morning.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . UPDATED: . 02:49 EST, 11 November 2011 . Cheated death: Lisa Somerville is lucky to be alive after her padded bra stop her ribs piercing her heart in a car crash . Young mother Lisa Somerville cheated death in a horrific car crash - thanks her bust-enhancing bra. The 28-year-old was driving home in a violent rainstorm on a notorious stretch of road when she lost control of her car and careered head-on into traffic. The mum-of-one had to be cut free from the car by firefighters and was rushed to the Royal Infirmary with a punctured lung, four cracked ribs and a broken nose. And when she finally regained consciousness, doctors told her the 'chicken fillets' in the lining of her bra, which she hated so much, had actually saved her life. Lisa said: 'I suffered a punctured lung and cracked ribs, but thanks to my chicken fillets I was still alive. I was told that otherwise my ribs would certainly have pierced my heart.' Her brush with death came while she was driving back from work to her home in Kirkintilloch, near Glasgow. Lisa rounded a corner on a busy, narrow, twisty side road and hit her brakes too hard losing control of the car before ploughing head-on into another car coming in the opposite direction. When she came round moments later, she had shooting pains throughout her body, the doors were jammed and she couldn't escape. She said: 'I was driving home from work, stupidly not wearing my seat-belt, when I lost control of my car and crashed on a slippery wet road. 'I was in a bad way - but I was still breathing. As doctors peeled back my clothes to get a better look at the damage, they noticed the skewered chicken fillets inside my bra. 'I was 'doubling up' - wearing four altogether - so that was what gave me the extra protection that saved my life.' Lisa, who has an eight-year-old daughter Jodi, added: 'I couldn't believe my luck, or the irony that something I'd hated for so long had saved my life.' More... Off-duty nurse saves crash victim's life... using a bra as a tourniquet . 'I love you daddy': First words for girl, 2, after doctors operate to give her a voice . She admits she has worn chicken fillets - often doubling up to increase her bust - since she was a teen. And she revealed how she was often jealous of her peers when growing up because of her chest and she hated wearing skimpy tops and bikinis, preferring to stay covered up. Now working as a receptionist at a hair and beauty salon in Kirkintilloch, Lisa added: 'I hated my chicken fillets and constantly feared they'd fall out at the most embarrassing moment. Skewered: The shattered 'chicken fillets' that saved Lisa. She was wearing two inserts on each side because she was so conscious about her breast size . But that night, for the first time in my life, I was grateful for them.' There was, however, an unwanted side effect to the life-saving fillets as it drew attention to her ultra-flat chest and AAA breasts. Friends, family and those she worked with at Aviva Insurance in Bishopbriggs were stunned that a bust-boosting bra helped her cheat death. Lisa said: 'I couldn't escape my biggest insecurity and it left me more miserable and depressed than ever about my inadequate body. 'I'd wanted a boob job since I was 12 and the unwanted attention after the accident was the final straw.' Happier than ever: After the crash, the mum-of-one decided to pay £4,000 to enhance her breasts from a AAA to a 30E . After recovering from the crash, which happened in May 2009, the self-conscious young Scot finally decided to go under the knife and have a breast enhancement. In September last year, Lisa paid £4,000 to upgrade her breasts from a AAA to a 30E. She said: 'I'm ten times more confident and happier than I've ever been, I'm even giving my new boobs a birthday celebration to mark their anniversary I love them so much. 'But I'll always be thankful to the chicken fillets that saved my life.'","Broken ribs would have pierced young mother's heart .

Victim: Leanne McNuff was killed in March this year after her ex-boyfriend learned that she had an abortion, a court heard . A soldier preparing to serve in Afghanistan stabbed his ex-girlfriend to death after he hacked into her Facebook account to find she had aborted their unborn baby, a jury was told today. Lance Corporal Ian Lowe, 25, kicked down the door to Leanne McNuff's home in Droylsden, Greater Manchester, before repeatedly knifing her, stamping on her face and leaving her to die on her landing floor on March 11 this year, a court heard. Miss McNuff's mother Margaret tried to save her daughter by stemming the flow of blood, but she died in hospital. Lowe, who was on bail at the time for . allegedly trying to throttle Miss McNuff while she was still pregnant, . had posted messages on Facebook shortly before the killing, the hearing . was told. One . read: 'Not even the army will help me out after all I have done for . Queen and country.' Another stated: 'Need a weapon out of armoury to . shoot the bitch'. Manchester Crown Court heard that the couple had been dating since 2006, but split up a month before the killing. After the break-up, Lowe warned Miss McNuff that he would 'make her life hell', the hearing was told. On . Valentine's Day, Miss McNuff learned that she was pregnant with Lowe's . baby and she rang him at his barracks in Catterick, North Yorkshire, where . he was serving in 1st Battalion, the Duke of Lancaster Regiment. 'She . made it clear that, although she didn’t want to resume a relationship . with him, she would not prevent him from seeing the baby when it was . born,' Neil Flewitt, prosecuting, told the jury. Killed: Leanne McNuff was repeatedly stabbed and stamped on by her former boyfriend, Ian Lowe, after he discovered she had terminated their unborn baby, a court was told . 'The defendant responded saying, if . they could not live together as a family, his life wouldn’t be worth . living and he would commit suicide.' Lowe was allowed home from base on compassionate grounds and, on arriving in Manchester, begged Miss McNuff to take him back. She agreed but said she 'wouldn’t kiss or cuddle him' because she 'no longer had feelings for him'. The . court heard that, when the pair met at Miss McNuff's home to discuss . the pregnancy on February 18, a violent row broke out during which Lowe . called Miss McNuff a 'prostitute' and accused her of 'sleeping around'. As . Miss McNuff tried to force him out of the house, Lowe is said to have . grabbed her by the thoat and begun 'shaking her from side to side'. Scene: Police at the house in Droylsden, Greater Manchester, where Leanne McNuff's body was found . In . a statement given to police at the time, Miss McNuff recalled: 'He’s . shaking me from side to side and I’m almost on the floor. 'I’ve lost my footing but being held up by Ian gripping my clothing and he’s shaking me about. 'Somehow, whilst he’s still ragging me about, I’ve twisted and he’s got hold of my hair. 'Now he’s got a grip of my clothing and a grip of my hair and he’s still shaking me about. Break up: Leanne McNuff and Lowe had been dating since 2006 but broke up a month before the killing in March this year . 'At . some point he’s let go of my jumper and his left arm has come around my . throat choking me and making it hard to breathe for a few seconds. I . was frightened to death. 'I didn’t know what was going to happen. I was scared wither he’d really hurt me or I’d lose the baby. 'Then Ian’s released me and pushed me to the floor. He’s gone to kick me. 'At first I think he was going to kick me hard but he held back and it wasn’t a very hard kick in my back. 'Then he’s picked up his bag and ran out of the gate.' Lowe was later arrested and charged with assault and was ordered not to contact Leanne under his bail conditions. But the court heard that, only an hour later, Miss McNuff rang police again to claim that Lowe had called her. The next day, February 20, Miss McNuff went in secret to an abortion clinic for a consultation. She terminated the unborn baby on March 1. Lowe found out about the abortion on March 10 - the day before the killing - when he hacked into Leanne’s Facebook account, the court heard. He wrote on his page: 'She tries to ruin my career, not only are you a benefit thief you are an oxygen thief as well'. A day later, he wrote: 'Just to let everyone know Leanne had aborted the baby. 'She did not tell me or even given me a say in the matter'. The court heard that Lowe then hacked Miss McNuff's Facebook account, falsely claiming she had slept with members of her own family. That evening, Lowe went for a drink with his father and a family friend who said he 'looked as if he had the weight of the world on his shoulders'. He is alleged to have killed Miss McNuff hours later. Lowe denies murder. The trial continues. Tributes: A policeman guards flowers left outside Miss McNuff's home following her death in March .

Omega-3 fatty acids found in oily fish -  which include sardines, mackerel and trout - destroy malignant cells in skin and mouth tumours while leaving healthy ones alone, experiments show. The finding could even lead to the development of aerosols or gels containing the molecules that zap skin and mouth cancers. Omega 3 fatty acids found in oily fish, such as this Java Mackerel, can destroy malignant cells in skin and mouth tumours while leaving healthy ones alone. Britons are currently advised to eat fish at least twice a week, including one portion of oily fish. A portion is 140g or six ounces . Experiments found the omega-3 fatty acids stopped induced cell death in both early and late stages of the diseases. Professor Kenneth Parkinson, of Queen Mary, University of London, said: ‘We found the omega-3 fatty acid selectively inhibited the growth of the malignant and pre malignant cells at doses which did not affect the normal cells. ‘Surprisingly, we discovered this was partly due to an over stimulation of a key growth factor (epidermal growth factor) which triggered cell death. This is a novel mechanism of action of these fatty acids.' Britons are currently advised to eat fish at least twice a week, including one portion of oily fish. A portion is 140g or six ounces. The finding published online in the journal Carcinogenesis suggests they could be used in both the treatment and prevention of certain skin and oral cancers. As well as oily fish, flax seeds and walnuts are also a good source for the molecules that also ward off heart disease . Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids cannot be made by humans in large quantities so we must acquire them from our diet. As well as oily fish, flaxseeds and walnuts are also a good source of the molecule that have been shown to ward off heart disease. While previous research has linked omega-3 fatty acids with the prevention of a number of cancers, there has been very little work done on oral cancers or normal cells . The researchers were studying a particular type of cancer called SCC (squamous cell carcinoma), one of the major forms of the disease. Squamous cells are the main part of the outermost layers of the skin, and also occur in the lining of the digestive tract, lungs and other areas of the body. Oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) are the sixth most common cancer worldwide and are difficult and very expensive to treat. The scientists grew cultures from several different cells lines, including both malignant oral and skin SCCs along with pre malignant cells and normal skin and oral cells, to which they added the fatty acids. While previous research has linked omega-3 fatty acids with the prevention of a number of cancers, there has been very little work done on oral cancers or normal cells. Lab member Dr Zacharoula Nikolakopoulou said: ‘As the doses needed to kill the cancer cells do not affect normal cells, especially with one particular fatty acid we used called EPA (Eicosapentaenoic acid), there is potential for using omega-3 fatty acids in the prevention and treatment of skin and oral cancers. ‘It may be those at an increased risk of such cancers, or their recurrence, could benefit from increased omega-3 fatty acids. 'Moreover, as the skin and oral cancers are often easily accessible, there is the potential to deliver targeted doses locally via aerosols or gels. However further research is needed to define the appropriate therapeutic doses.'","Omega-3 fatty acids shown to destroy cells in skin and oral tumours .

Jailed: Nathan Rawling, 36, subjected the infant to a violent assault, causing numerous fractures and bruises . A 36-year-old electrician was today jailed for 10 years after battering a 31-day-old baby boy so badly that his heart stopped - which led to a vigilante mob storming the attacker’s home. The tiny baby nearly died after suffering 26 fractured ribs, two broken collarbones, a broken arm and two punctured lungs in what was called a ‘frenzied, brutal and repeated assault’ by Nathan Rawling, of Gravesend, Kent. During the December 2011 attack, Rawling also inflicted a shocking injury to the boy’s genitalia, Maidstone Crown Court heard. After the attack police had to stop a 100-strong mob trying to storm the home of Rawling, who denied assaulting the baby, but was found guilty of grievous bodily harm with intent after a trial. Doctors resuscitated the baby at Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford, Kent, after Rawling brought him in ‘at the point of death’ after trying to ‘cause really serious harm’, prosecutors said. ‘The baby had collapsed and received urgent life-saving treatment,’ prosecutor John O’Higgins said. ‘There was both cardiac and pulmonary arrest - no heartbeat and no breathing.’ He added: ‘There was cardiac massage for 10 minutes before the heartbeat returned.’ The court heard Rawling, an ex-Kent County Council electrician, was arrested by police and initially admitted causing the injuries, but claimed it was a ‘misguided’ attempt to save the baby’s life. Treatment: Doctors resuscitated the baby at Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford, Kent, after Rawling brought him in 'at the point of death' after trying to 'cause really serious harm', prosecutors said . He told police he had tried to perform CPR on the baby after noticing he had turned blue and stopped breathing. Rawling claimed the broken arm was caused when he grabbed the baby to restart CPR and the injury to the boy’s genitals was caused when he knelt on them. He also claimed the baby’s ribs were broken because he probably pushed down too hard on them when giving the CPR. But later Rawling changed his defence after accepting medical evidence that the baby’s injuries could not have been caused by resuscitation. He said the only possible explanation was that the injuries must have been inflicted by the baby’s mother. Rawling told the jury: ‘I am still at a loss to know how he ended up in the state he did. I have found it very hard to come to terms with everything that happened. I have struggled with it. ‘I have found it very hard that anyone could do it. I still don’t quite understand.’ But Mr O’Higgins said Rawling fully intended to cause serious injury to the baby. Referring to the boy’s genital injuries, he said: ‘We suggest the baby weed over him and that he caused that terrible injury to his penis as a result. ‘It may be he did try to save the baby and perform CPR, but if so it was because only moments before he had almost killed (the child).’ 'I am still at a loss to know how he ended up in the state he did. I have found it very hard to come to terms with everything that happened. I have struggled with it. I have found it very hard that anyone could do it. I still don’t quite understand' Nathan Rawling . Following, the sentencing, Kent Police’s senior investigating officer, Detective Chief Inspector Andrew Pritchard, said: ‘This was an extremely serious assault on an innocent baby boy. ‘In my service I have not seen such extensive injuries on such a young child. It was a case that shocked the public and caused considerable community tension in Gravesend. ‘The infant, who was just 31 days old, suffered incredible trauma, which arguably should have cost him his life or at the very least left him with long-term medical problems. ‘However, thanks to the excellent work of the doctors and nurses at Darent Valley Hospital and Kings College Hospital, he not only survived the attack but is now doing well. ‘Rawling is a bully who took out his anger in the most cowardly way possible when he assaulted this baby and it is satisfying to see that justice has been served.’ After the attack police had to restrain a vigilante mob who tried to storm Rawling’s home. Stones and other missiles were thrown at the house, causing damage to the front door and windows. It happened when a number of people held a candlelit vigil outside the house, praying for the injured baby who they feared might die. Some of the mob targeted another house in the neighbourhood where they believed Rawling was staying. The violence and tension led to a local police chief making a public appeal for calm.","Tiny baby nearly died after attack by Nathan Rawling, 36, in December 2011 .

Girls' Day School Trust CEO Helen Fraser will say today that bosses need to boost the confidence of female employees to help them fulfil their potential . Bosses should tell their women employees how good they are to give them the confidence to rise to the top, a girls' school leader will say today. Helen Fraser, head of the Girls' Day School Trust (GDST), says talented women need to be told 'directly and to their face how good they are' if their managers want to keep them and get the most out of them. In a speech at the trust's annual conference today, Mrs Fraser will tell heads and governors from its 26 schools and academies that the main problem for working women is 'discouragement', rather than 'babies'. The GDST CEO says women currently suffer from 'two lost decades' between the ages of 30 and 50 when women are overtaken by men in the workplace, despite doing better than them at the start of their careers. And she says teachers need to build girls' confidence and resilience to help them blow their own trumpets in the workplace and weather the tough times they will invariably encounter in the workplace. Mrs Fraser will also call for female quotas in the boardroom, to counteract the 'old boys' network' that promotes only leaders who look and act like those currently in charge. Speaking at the trust's 141st conference, she will highlight women's lack of confidence in the workplace as the key problem holding them back. She says that typically, an employer would see a female employee: 'doing really fantastic work quietly in a corner, thinking to herself ""Someone will notice, someone will notice"", and feeling that it would somehow be undignified to jump on her desk and say ""Look at the amazing solution to this problem I have just come up with"". 'But the terrible truth is that no one does notice – they are just too busy – and there may be a young man a couple of desks along who has come up with something equally good, who does wave his hands in the air and tell everyone how clever he has been. 'And guess who catches the chief executive’s eye?' Fraser cites high-flying mothers like Pearson CEO Marjorie Scardino, left, and fund manager Nicola Horlick . Mrs Fraser says employers also need to make sure their female staff feel appreciated. She will tell delegates today that: 'A good boss – of either sex – who takes the time and trouble to tell a young woman employee that she is doing well and has done some terrific work can make all the difference. 'Of course both sexes need validation, but I would say that companies that want to get the most out of their young women employees, want them to fulfil their potential and stay on through babies or otherwise to rise to the top, should look very carefully at their appraisal process, and should make sure that talented women are told directly and to their face how good they are. 'A validated woman employee will go far.' Mrs Fraser will also call for compulsory quotas for women on company boards in the UK, as a temporary rather than permanent measure. 'Companies... should make sure that talented women are told directly and to their face how good they are.' - Helen Fraser, Girls' Day School Trust CEO . She says: 'With the possible exception of boardroom quotas, I believe we’ve probably gone as far as necessary in terms of legislating for equality.' 'As a pragmatist I am very much in favour of ""what works"", and it is clear to me that quotas for women would make a big difference in a short space of time. 'I don’t think this would need to be a permanent measure, but a short-term one until the representation of women reaches a tipping point.' Women currently make up less than 20 per cent of directors of FTSE100 companies, and the vast majority of these are non-executive directors. And while two-thirds of those entering the legal profession are women, they only make up 16 per cent of High Court judges. Citing high-flying mothers such as mother-of-three Pearson CEO Marjorie Scardino and mother-of-six fund manager Nicola Horlick, Mrs Fraser will say: 'You sometimes hear the excuse, ""But they all go off and have babies"". That’s not the real issue, and it’s just that, an excuse – we need to look deeper, at what’s really holding women back. 'We need to look at what society is doing that is holding women back – from a long hours culture in too many workplaces to an old boys’ network that only likes to promote individuals who look, speak and think like the current leadership.' The schools leader, whose group includes leading schools like Putney High, Bath's Royal High, and Wimbledon High, has always been an ardent advocate of high-achieving women. Mrs Fraser, 64, who has two daughters of her own and two step-daughters, has spoken before of the 'nappy wall' rather than the 'glass ceiling' that threatens women in the workplace. Last year she said women should be 'ambitious in their relationships' and choose a husband who would act as a cheerleader for their careers.","Helen Fraser says men shout their successes while female workers don't .

"By . Rob Cooper . UPDATED: . 06:14 EST, 7 March 2012 . A father has been banned from being alone with his eight-year-old daughter after telling police he accidentally accessed child porn while attempting to download music from the internet. Nigel Robinson says his life has been plunged into a nightmare since he reported himself to authorities as an act of good citizenship. When the 43-year-old plumber told police he had inadvertently downloaded shocking pictures of ‘young girls’, officers contacted social services. Prohibited: Nigel Robinson, pictured with his wife Liz, cannot have unsupervised contact with their eight-year-old . His laptop was seized and – because of . lengthy waiting times for police analysis of computers in non-urgent . cases – the investigation could mean he is not allowed to be alone with . his daughter for a year. Mr Robinson claims he is being treated like a criminal for trying to do the right thing. ‘When I saw these images I wanted to . do something about it,’ he said. ‘I didn’t want anyone else’s children . to be exploited in this way. ‘I can categorically state 1,000 per . cent there will be nothing inappropriate on my computer other than the . files I told the police about. ‘I can understand there needs to be . caution. It is a very serious matter, but to be told it may be a year . before the conclusion is just madness. I cannot take my daughter to the . park, swimming or anything. ‘It has been a nightmare. I feel like I . am guilty until proven innocent. That is not the way I understood the . British justice system to work. ‘I wish I had just binned the laptop and then none of this would have happened. ‘Whoever was uploading this will be miles away by now, yet I’m under the finger of suspicion.’ Mr Robinson, from Hull, said he was . trying to download an album by the rock guitarist Slash from a . file-sharing website – which he accepts is itself illegal – when the . incident happened. Despite the practice being against the law, millions . of people obtain music for free in this way. When he opened the folder of files he . had downloaded, which he says he believed contained music, he found . files with girls’ names. ‘When I opened some of them up, I . realised they were young girls,’ he said. ‘I immediately called my wife. I was panicking. I asked her what she thought I should do and her . response was to call the police. ‘I was willing to take it on the chin . for downloading the music. I half expected to get arrested for that but . felt it was important because someone was obviously uploading this.’ Mr Robinson phoned Humberside Police . and was told statements would need to be taken by officers and also East . Riding of Yorkshire Council’s social services department. It was at these interviews that he . learned he would not be allowed unsupervised access to his daughter . until the investigation was over. The order was put in place in November and detectives warned Mr Robinson it could be a year before the laptop was examined. Child porn: Mr Robinson, 43, said he was trying to download music when he accidentally opened indecent images of young girls . Yesterday his wife Liz, 32, a care home assistant manager, spoke about the problems the family now faced. When she worked a night shift, she . said, she had to arrange for someone to be in the house with her husband . or send their daughter to her grandmother’s house. ‘Why does my . daughter have to suffer? Technically my daughter could miss a year of . her life with her dad,’ she said. ‘I think it’s bureaucracy gone mad.’ Police confirmed the inquiry could take a year to complete as the case has ‘to go in a queue’. A spokesman said: ‘We are conducting . an investigation that has resulted in the confiscation of a laptop, in . order for the relevant inquiries to take place. ‘This is a standard procedure for this type of investigation. ‘The laptop is sent away to be . examined and, as this forms the basis for a number of different . investigations, Humberside Police has no control over the amount of time . it takes for the laptop to be returned.’ East Riding social services said the . access ban was ‘a proportionate response’ based ‘on the information it . presently has about this case’.","Nigel Robinson called police on wife’s advice after 'accessing porn while trying to download music'

Henry Hadley 1880, has been revealed as the first British man to die in World War I by a new book . The first Briton killed in what would become known as the Great War has long been recorded as Private John Parr, who died three weeks after it began. But according to a military historian, the conflict’s first British casualty was in fact a 51-year-old languages teacher called Henry Hadley. He perished barely three hours after Britain declared war on Germany – shot in the stomach after a row on a train as he tried to make his way home from Berlin. His unfortunate story is revealed in a book published this week. Public school-educated Mr Hadley, a former officer in the West India Regiment, was teaching in Berlin when Germany declared war on France on August 3, 1914. Realising that Britain would soon be drawn into the conflict, he caught a train for Paris at 11am that day. But he became ‘agitated then angry’ with a waiter when the service was too slow in the restaurant car and a ‘heated exchange’ took place in front of some German officers. Having gone back to his seat, he returned to the corridor for some reason – where one of the soldiers shot him in the stomach at point-blank range with a revolver. Mr Hadley was just short of the Belgian border. His terrified housekeeper and travelling companion, Elizabeth Pratley, rushed out of the carriage to find him on the floor surrounded by German soldiers. He gasped: ‘They have shot me, Mrs Pratley; I am a done man.’ Britain had not formally declared war on Germany when Mr Hadley was shot. He was taken to hospital and clung to life for 24 hours, but died at 3.15am German time on August 5, 1914. Britain had declared war on Germany just three hours before – at midnight German time, or 11pm British time on August 4. Military historian Richard van Emden revealed the strange story of Mr Hadley’s sad demise yesterday. When news of Mr Hadley’s death reached London, the Government demanded an explanation but the Germans ‘rebutted all claims of foul play’. The German officer who shot him, Lieutenant Nicolay, justified the killing by claiming that Mr Hadley was ‘acting suspiciously’, was ‘vague about his travel arrangements’ and had raised a stick at him when confronted. ‘The British government considered the shooting nothing less than murder,’ Mr van Emden says in the book. It is usually recorded that the first British casualty of the Great War, the 100th anniversary of which will be marked next year, was Private Parr. Public school-educated Mr Hadley, a former officer in the West India Regiment, was teaching in Berlin when Germany declared war on France on August 3, 1914. He was killed on August 21, two days before the Battle of Mons . He was killed on August 21, two days before the Battle of Mons. Mr van Emden made his discovery after unearthing Mrs Pratley’s eye-witness account of Mr Hadley’s death. He said: ‘[Mr Hadley] was the first British casualty of the Great War and the first person to die as the direct result of enemy action. Henry Hadley just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. ‘He also seems to have made the mistake of upsetting an armed German officer in the atmosphere of heightened tension as the whole of Europe plummeted into war. ‘Having spent two decades researching and writing about the Great War, his story is, to me, an amazing, fresh discovery.’ After his army career, Mr Hadley, who was educated at Cheltenham College, became a language teacher in Cheltenham. He had been working in Berlin for three or four years  when hostilities broke out. Mr Hadley is believed to have been buried in a pauper’s grave in a German cemetery, but there is no headstone to show his final resting place. After the shooting, Mrs Pratley was ‘whisked off for interrogation’ in a military prison as the Germans sought to establish if either she or Mr Hadley were spies. She protested her innocence and was released, but by then was in such a ‘weakened and nervous state’ that she was taken to a Roman Catholic hospital to recover. Between 1914 and the war’s end, almost one million more British troops lost their lives. The last British soldier killed in action was Private George Ellison. He was also shot at Mons, just before the official ceasefire at 11am on November 11, 1918. The story of Mr Hadley’s death is featured in Mr van Emden’s book Meeting The Enemy, which will be released on Thursday.","Henry Hadley died barely three hours after Britain declared war on Germany .

Boys as young as 11 and 12 are sending sexually explicit messages to girls via social media, David Cameron's childhood guru warned today. Claire Perry, MP for Devizes, said 'sexting', which included young boys sending images of their genitalia to girls, was increasingly commonplace in schools. The problem cuts across the social divide, she said during a debate in the Commons about the need to end violence against women, telling MPs she had heard of a serious case of sexual abuse at a leading independent school. Claire Perry, MP for Devizes, said boys as young as 11 and 12 are sending sexually explicit messages to girls on the internet and using mobile phones . Mrs Perry said that in the case of . 13-year-old Chevonea Kendall-Bryan, the abuse had tragic consequences . after the youngster apparently jumped to her death in despair at being . filmed performing a sex act on a boy. The MP, who has campaigned for better . protections online, said while Britain was now 'leading the world' when . it came to making sure internet services providers introduced filters to . stop youngsters accessing pornography, the NSPCC warned of children . turning to social media to share user-generated content. Facebook was one site, MPs heard, where images could be shared and then instantly deleted. Mrs Perry said: 'I don’t mean to . scaremonger but it seems to me that we are conducting a long-term . experiment with our children, particularly our girls and young women, in . exposing them in such a free way to the sorts of violent, degrading, . and often very sexualised content in the online world. 'This is a huge, growing and endemic problem. We have no idea how big the problem is. MPs were told 'Sexting' can have a devastating effect on young girls . Tory Sarah Wollaston told the Commons 80 per cent of boys aged 15-17 were regularly accessing hardcore pornography .

Tragedy: This week's story about 13-year-old Chevonea Kendall-Bryan (pictured) shows how deeply young teens can be affected by sexting . Dr Wollaston said: 'There’s nothing . new about sexual violence but what has changed is the normalisation and . acceptance of sexual violence within our society.' She used the newspapers read by fellow MPs as an example of how society had been increasingly sexualised. She told the Commons 80 per cent of boys aged 15-17 were regularly accessing hardcore pornography. 'To my mind that constitutes a normalisation, if it’s being accessed by 80 per cent of young men,' she said. There was also 'the extent to which we see sexting, and the extent to which this is going unchallenged'. Turning to the reading matter in the . Commons, she said: 'To give another example, you may say this is a . milder version of it, but when I go into the tea room in the House of . Commons and I see colleagues having newspapers that I would take as . (having) images that objectify women, I find that offensive.

The insistence that she was a boy began when Kathryn was two years old and only became more pronounced, distressed and frustrated as she grew older. By the time she was four, Kathryn's parents began to realize there was more going on than just Kathryn being a tomboy. After seeing a psychologist who diagnosed Kathryn as having gender dysphoria and recommended they let her to live as a boy, Jean and Stephen allowed Kathryn to become Tyler (names have been changed) and watched as their daughter bloomed into a happy, playful little boy. Insistent: Tyler receives a longed-for short haircut after insisting for years that he was not a girl . According to The Washington Post, for years, their little girl had been telling Stephen and Jean that she was a little boy. Stephen recalls a car trip with Kathryn that made him realize how desperately unhappy his child was in her skin. 'Daddy, I’m going to read you a story, okay?' Kathryn told her father, before opening a book and pretending to read. Her story was about a little boy who was born 'like a girl' and how sad he was. The couple decided to take their younger child  to see a psychologist specializing in transgender. Michele Angello confirmed what they already knew - Tyler had gender dysphoria and it was unlikely to change. 'If Tyler wants to be Kathryn again, that’s fine,' Jean told The Washington Post. 'But right now, this works. He’s happy. I just want my child to be happy.' For Tyler's older sister, 8, it's fairly simple: 'It’s just a boy mind in a girl body,' she told her classmates about her brother. The Washington Post first profiled Tyler and his family when he was five. Tyler's parents had followed their psychologist's advice and faced the difficulty of imparting the news of Tyler's change to their families and community. She and him: Once Kathryn was allowed to become Tyler, many behavioral issues he'd been having stopped . The idea of a child being transgender is controversial. Making . a decision that will affect children for the rest of their lives at . such a young age seems folly to some, but experts say gender asserts . itself in early childhood. 'In children, gender solidifies at about three to six,' Patrick Kelly, a psychiatrist with the division of child and adolescent psychiatry at Johns Hopkins Children’s Center, told The Washington Post. This is when children begin showing a strong preference for some things over others - for girls it may be dolls, make-up and other trappings of a grown-up woman, and for boys it may be trucks and Spiderman. Kathryn at two had told her parents she was a boy, and from there they faced constant struggles over clothing, haircuts and the word 'she'. The idea of allowing children to transition from one gender to another has only really be happening in the U.S. for about 10 years, Jack Drescher, a New York psychiatrist and leader in the field of gender orientation, told The Washington Post. Allowing a child to live as one sex when biologically another by changing their appearance is one thing, but bigger questions arise as the child matures. Disorder: Psychiatrists say people with gender dysphoria have 'a persistent and intense distress about assigned sex' When Tyler begins to show the first signs of puberty, his parents will have to decide whether to begin giving him puberty blockers to stop his woman's body developing. Tyler's mother says they'll cross that bridge when they come to it. Right now, she's just glad to have a happy child. Tyler was permitted to enroll at school . as a boy, and now, at six years old and 18 months after his public switch, he has a Spider-man themed bedroom . and a cohort of little playmates to compare space cruisers with. Jean says Tyler has full access to his sister's trove of pink, glittery, girl things - but that he's never showed the slightest interest. 'It may just be gender variance,' she told The Washington Post. 'But it's not likely.' 'It’s not a phase. Anyone who meets him says, ""Yeah, that’s a boy.""' Jean says she's constantly facing criticism and finding herself sticking up for her son - and transgendered people in general. She's even had co-workers at the gym where she's a teacher sniggering at Tyler in his swim trunks at the pool. 'You become this advocate. All day, every day,' she told The Washington Post. Out of his shell: Since his change, Tyler has revelled in his new identity and become a much more happy and content child . Psychiatrists are quick to point out that gender dysphoria is much more than merely effeminate boys or tomboyish girls. According to the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, . people who suffer gender dysphoria experience 'a persistent and intense . distress about assigned sex, together with a desire to be (or . insistence that one is) of the other sex. There is a persistent . preoccupation with the dress and activities of the opposite sex and . repudiation of the individual’s own sex.' And cases like Tyler's are becoming more and more common, with six-year-old Coy Mathis, who was born a boy but identifies as a girl, winning the right to use the female bathroom at her school in a civil rights suit in Eagleside, Colorado recently. A new bill set to pass in California will allow children to choose sports teams and bathrooms based on their gender identity. Bat boy: Tyler has always rejected his sister's hand-me-downs and thrown tantrums when forced to wear leotards or dresses . According to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey, 45 per cent of transgender/non-gender conforming 18-24-year-old's had attempted suicide in 2011. It's this kind of unhappiness Jean and Stephen are hoping to avoid with Tyler, by allowing him to be exactly who he is. As for Tyler, he seems at peace with his new identity. According to The Washington Post, he has even revealed his own situation on at least one occasion to a friend. The result was much less complex than the adult discussions surrounding transgender children: . '""Whatever,” the kid said, and they dived back into trucks and light-saber play.'","Kathryn transitioned to Tyler at the age of five after insisting since the age of two that she was a boy .

Deadly: The number of HIV cases in Greece is on the rise, because more prostitutes are on the streets and needle exchange programmes have been scrapped (file picture) Savage cuts to the Greek health service have seen the country's HIV and Tuberculosis rates soar - sparking fears it is becoming a third world nation. Aid agencies said the cutting of hospital budgets by an astonishing 40 per cent had also led to a sharp rise in the number of citizens being diagnosed with Malaria. In the south, they said, it is reaching near endemic levels not seen since 1970s. The scrapping of needle exchange services has seen the number of HIV and Aids sufferers in central Athens rise by 1,250 per cent in 2011 alone. There are more prostitutes on the streets selling their bodies to make ends meet, while heroin addicts are finding it harder to come by anti-retroviral treatments. There is also the first instances ever of the two illnesses being transmitted between mother and child - something usually equated with sub-Saharan Africa and not Europe. Médecins sans Frontières Greece's Reveka Papadopoulos said the health service cuts, which saw widespread job losses, were putting social services 'under very severe strain'. She added: 'If not in a state of breakdown. What we are seeing are very clear indicators of a system that cannot cope'. She said the 40 per cent cuts were on top of a 24 per cent increase in 2011 in demand for medical services. This, . she said, was 'largely because people could simply no longer afford . private healthcare. The entire system is deteriorating'. On the rise: The number of HIV and Aids sufferers in Greece is soaring . She added: 'There has also been a . sharp increase in cases of tuberculosis in the immigrant population. 'Cases of Nile fever - leading to 35 deaths in 2010 - and the . reappearance of endemic malaria in several parts of Greece. 'The . simple fact of the reappearance of malaria, with 100-odd cases in . southern Greece last year and 20 to 30 more elsewhere, shows barriers to . healthcare access have risen. 'Malaria is treatable, it shouldn't spread if the system is working.' Good news: Greece is set to receive the next tranche of eurozone bailout cash next week . The news comes as it was revealed Greece will get €5.9billion in new bailout money on Monday. It is the first slice of a new rescue package meant to keep the country afloat while it overhauls its economy. Greece . stands to receive a total of €172.7 billion from its partners in the . 17-nation eurozone and the International Monetary Fund until 2016. Spain now owes more money than it has done in the last 20 years, the Bank of Spain said. For 2011 the country's public debt was 68.5 percent of gross domestic product, up from 61.2 per cent in 2010. While it is a relatively low ratio, compared with its 16 eurozone peers who have an average 87.7 per cent, it has almost doubled from 36.3 per cent in 2007. This is because there is a lack of economic impetus since the credit-and-construction bubble burst in 2008. Spain has been ordered by the European Commission to cut its budget shortfall from 8.5 per cent of GDP in 2011 to 5.3 per cent this year and 3 per cent in 2013. It has forced Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to hunt for savings worth around €60billion. This year's target is a compromise after Rajoy defied Brussels by ditching a much tighter goal of 4.4 per cent of GDP agreed by the previous government. But the task will be made tougher as the economy is thought to already be in its second recession in three years, with the government expecting output to shrink 1.7 per cent in 2012. The cuts has led to the closure of 27 publicly run companies, some of which were duplicates - such as a water company. Others included a loss-making entity tasked with stimulating Spain's small housing rental market and one created to back the Barcelona Olympics in 1992. The central bank also said Spain's 17 autonomous regions, blamed for the lion's share of the fiscal slippage last year, ran debt up by 17.3 per cent in 2011 to €140billion. The data showed the country's wealthiest region of Catalonia, was the most indebted, closely followed by Valencia.  Both had debt-to-GDP ratios of around 20 per cent compared to an average of 13.1 per cent. Tighter controls over regional budgets imposed by the central government aim to bring their spending back under control this year, even if analysts retain doubts over their future compliance and banks' balance sheets. The sum includes money left over from the country's first rescue package and a new €130billion programme. The disbursement was approved earlier this week, said Matthias Mors, the European Commission representative to the troika - the debt inspectors from the European Union, the European Central Bank and the IMF who are managing the Greek bailout. The bailout, on its own, will not be enough to ease the country's financial woes. An EU report released today said Greece must make a sustained effort to attract future investment and support export-led growth as it seeks to recover from a recession that is now in its fifth year. But the report, prepared by the European Commission and the ECB, also said a bond swap deal with private creditors has made the country's debt load far more sustainable in the long-term. The news has had a positive effect on European financial markets. The FTSE 100 is today 0.45 per cent up at 5,967.43; France's CAC 40 is 0.54 per cent up at 3,599.37; and Germany's DAX is 0.33 per cent up at 7,168.37. The report projects that, assuming interim targets are met, Greece's debt-to-GDP ratio will decline to below 117 per cent in 2020 and to below 90 per cent in 2030. It was as high as 160 per cent of GDP before the debt relief deal was agreed with private creditors. While progress has been made in reforming the economy, significant concerns remain, including inflation, a lack of credit available to households and business, and the need to regain competitiveness by reducing labor costs, Mors said. 'One of the priorities of this second program is the recapitalization of banks,' Mors said. For one thing, bank deposits have fallen, he said. For another, the agreement to write down private debt 'will leave holes in the balance sheets of banks, because they held government bonds,' he added. He said the new program includes €50 billion for bank recapitalisation. 'This is an enormous amount,' he said. Mors also warned that significant more belt-tightening lies ahead. 'The target for this year is a primary deficit of 1 per cent,' he said, referring to the budget balance before interest payments. 'And the programme target for 2014 is a surplus of 4.5 per cent. And therefore people have to be aware that, in terms of fiscal adjustment, there's still a long way to go.' He said the Greek government will have to identify before this summer how it plans to close that gap.","Prostitution and heroin addiction on rise as hospital budgets cut by 40% .

It like it’s something out of a science-fiction movie – genius scientists engineer a synthetic skin that’s part living, part electronics. But scientists at Harvard University have done just that, creating meshes of electronic and biological tissue. The end result is cyborg tissue, which is created from electrodes and wires combined on a Nano-scale. Engineering humanity: Scientists at Harvard have found a way to create cyborg skin, using nano-wires to mesh and human cells . High tech: Here, cardiac cells are pictured with a nano-electroic electrode highlighted . The results, published in Nature Materials, detail how scientists in the lab embedded electrical nanowires into the lab-grown flesh. Dr Charles Lieber, who is a chemistry professor at Harvard and the leader of the research team, told the Harvard Gazette: ‘With this technology, for the first time, we can work at the same scale as the unit of biological system without interrupting it. ‘Ultimately, this is about merging tissue with electronics in a way that it becomes difficult to determine where the tissue ends and the electronics begin.’ The Gazette notes that the researches initially worried about how the ‘skin,’ once implanted, would sense and react to chemical and electrical changes. Normal human skin is capable of sensing oxygen, pH, and other elements in the air, and reacts to each one accordingly. The challenge, then, was engineering skin that would do the same. First, a 3D mesh of organic polymer is laid out with nanoscale wires within. According to Nature Materials, the wires serve as ‘critical sensing elements.’ High tech: A computer chip, containing a sample of nano tissue . Man vs. machine: Cyborg skin has been imagined in Hollywood for decades, including the 1991 blockbuster Terminator 2 . Then, they worked in human neurons, heart cells, and blood vessels. When the substrate was dissolved, researchers had mesh they could contour into the shapes they needed. Because of the embedded wiring, scientists were able to obtain accurate readings of pH. Human cyborgs have been imagined in Hollywood for decades, famously in the Star Trek and Terminator franchises. In both, the cyborg characters have decidedly human appearances, though below the epidermis still lurks a robotic core of metal. However, the Harvard scientists are not looking to such lofty ends. Dr Lieber told the Gazette said their invention could greatly benefit the pharmaceutical industry, which could test its drugs on the cyborg skin instead of few layers of cultured cells.","Harvard scientists created 'cyborg' skin from neurons, heart cells, and nano-electronic wiring .

The unique giant fluorescent pink slug Triboniophorous graeffei found only in the misty Mount Kaputar area of New South Wales, Australia. It grows around 20 centrimetres long and feeds on moss. It is a relative of the Red Triangle slug found in other areas of New South Wales and Queensland . Mount Kaputar is a mountain near Narrabri in northern New South Wales. It is situated around 323 miles northwest of Sydney. It stands at 1,508 metres, is part of the Nandewar Range and has been preserved within the Mount Kaputar National Park. It is the remnants of an extinct volcano that was active about 18 million years ago. Most of the vegetation on the mountain is dry forest yet there are small pockets of damp rainforest-style environments where unique creatures such as the pink slug and cannibal snail live. During winter months the region can get long periods of heavy rainfall as well as dusting of snow near the mountain's summit. Locals have long reported sightings of the bizarre pink slug, especially after heavy rainfall, yet taxonomists have only recently confirmed it is the same species as the red triangle slug, officially known as Triboniophorus graeffi.

The slug is just one of the rare inhabitants of the misty region of Mount Kaputar that is also synonymous with flowering snow gum plants and native vines. Because of these rare and unique creatures, the New South Wales Scientific committee has recently made a preliminary decision to list the site as an 'endangered ecological community'. This means it has the highest level of protection from intrusion and development. The committee's report said: 'These species have evolved from lowland ancestors and have been isolated in an otherwise snail-hostile environment as conditions began to dry.

It was a little mistake with calamitous consequences and this is the tragedy we're left with. He added: 'We are all devastated but we are being strong.' The family had been staying at their holiday home on the island before the tragic accident last Thursday afternoon. Anthony, a company director, said lifeguards got to the couple within a few minutes, pulled them both back to the beach and battled for at least half an hour to save Nikki. Anthony praised the lifeguards for their efforts. He said: 'They tried tirelessly to revive my wife and were very sensitive, as were the police and ambulance staff.'

Anthony met Nikki 20 years ago at the Asda store in Accrington and bonded over their mutual vegetarianism. Nikki, who is originally from Whalley, was a housewife who also volunteered for the Home-Start charity, offering friendship and practical help with families with young children in East Lancashire. She also used to own The Crown Wheel restaurant in King Street, Whalley, which is now the Italian restaurant Amico Mio. The family received consular assistance from the Foreign Office and arrived back in the UK at around 12am on Sunday. The strong currents at Famara Beach have already claimed the life of one Briton - in a tragedy last April. In a chilling echo of Nikki Bate's death, Steve Potter lost his life at the same resort after getting into difficulties while out swimming in April this year. The 43-year-old was dragged from the water unconscious and could not be revived.

Simply improving the quality of water and using soap could make children grow taller, according to the first study of its kind. Researchers found that basic methods to maintain good hygiene could add half a centimetre to a five-year-old as poor personal care can increase the risk of infection in the gut, thereby reducing the amount of nutrients absorbed. It could also reduce the prevalence of stunted growth, which irreversibly affects physical and mental development of an estimated 165million children worldwide, by up to 15 per cent. Simple measures: Improving the quality of water and washing hands could make children grow taller, according to the first study of its kind (file picture) The study's authors say the findings are key to tackling the 'burden of undernutrition' which causes 3.1million deaths annually and accounts for nearly half of all deaths of under-fives. The study was carried out for the Cochrane Review and authored by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and charity WaterAid. It examined 14 studies conducted in low- and middle-income countries including Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Chile and Nepal using data on 9,000 children. Yael Velleman, one of the authors and a . senior policy analyst at WaterAid, told The Independent that the link . between disinfecting water, sanitation and nutrition could explain why children in . some countries are shorter than others in equally developed nations.

Lead author, Dr Alan Dangour, who is also a senior research fellow at the DfID, added: 'Providing clean water, sanitation and hygiene is an effective way to reduce the incidence and associated deaths from diseases such as diarrhoea – which remains the third biggest killer of under-fives worldwide.

A New York man who became obsessed with convicted killer Jodi Arias has been arrested for allegedly threatening to kill broadcaster Nancy Grace because of her negative coverage. David Lee Simpson, 48, also allegedly described in graphic detail how he would kill another Turner Broadcasting anchor, Jane Velez-Mitchell, after she also spoke passionately about Arias' guilt. He allegedly wrote on Twitter in June that he wanted to tie the women to a 'tree naked and leave them to suffer . all night,' then 'slit their throats'. 'Plot': David Lee Simpson allegedly became so infatuated with convicted killer Jodi Arias that he threatened to kill two Turner anchors who made negative remarks about her while covering her trial . Simpson also allegedly commented . that he wanted to 'gut [one of the women] like a deer'. Shortly after making the remarks, he quit his job at an auto repair shop and told colleagues in Bath, New York that he was leaving town and began driving south. But on July 17, he was arrested at a traffic stop and officers found guns, ammunition, handcuffs, zip ties, binoculars, a police radio and a news article about the shooting in Newtown, KPHO reported. 'This suspect was on his way south with enough weapons in his car to do serious harm to someone,' Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio said. 'Fortunately, we acted quickly enough, and in doing so, were able to stop him before anything could transpire.' Anger: He allegedly said that he wanted to tie HLN anchor Nancy Grace up and slit her throat . Outrage: The comments were also directed at anchor Jane Velez-Mitchell, pictured covering the trial . Arpaio had began investigating Simpson after he became aware of the remarks. He told a press conference: 'Evidently, Simpson was infatuated with Jodi Arias. He also told an employee where he worked previously that he wanted the hang the commentator by her feet and gut her like a deer. These were some of the Tweets that came over.' An indictment that charges Simpson, 48, with three counts of computer tampering and two counts of stalking had not yet been made publicly available late Monday afternoon. Simpson also is accused of threatening a Phoenix woman who defended the anchors online. The sheriff said investigators don't know whether Simpson was intending to carry out his threats, but he said items found in Simpson's vehicle were disturbing. Obsession: Simpson allegedly became obsessed with Jodi Arias, who could face the death penalty for murder . Victim: She was convicted of killing her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander to death in June 2008 . Simpson was expected to be brought to Arizona on Wednesday, Arpaio said. Court records show he does not yet have a lawyer. On May 8, a Maricopa County jury convicted Arias of murder in the death of her boyfriend Travis Alexander. He had been stabbed 27 times, his throat slit open and was shot in the head at his Arizona home in June 2008. Throughout the 18-day trial, Arias, 33, maintained that the killing was in self-defense. The jury failed to reach a unanimous decision on whether to sentence the former waitress to life in prison or death. While her murder conviction stands, prosecutors must now decide whether to try again for a death sentence with a new jury or to settle for life in prison. Cache: Investigators found several guns, handcuffs, zip . ties and a news clipping about last December's mass shooting in . Newtown, Connecticut, in Simpson's car . Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio said told the media Simpson was evidently 'infatuated' with Jodi Arias . In court filings, prosecutors have asked the judge to begin new penalty-phase proceedings on July 30. But defense attorneys asked that the proceedings be delayed until January because of scheduling conflicts and the possibility that Arias might want to call witnesses to speak on her behalf. A new hearing was set last week for August 26, giving Arias' lawyers additional time to file motions as want the jury's finding that made her eligible for the death penalty vacated.

The newly-released biopic of Apple founder Steve Jobs, entitled Jobs, has resulted in a furious exchange between Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and the film's lead, Ashton Kutcher. Kutcher plays the tech visionary in the film, about which Wozniak has posted his own unsolicited review on the tech site Gizmodo. Wozniak dismissed the film, which follows Jobs from his days as a college drop-out to the game-changing release of the iPod in 2001, as 'fiction' and accused Kutcher of being 'disingenuous'. Scroll down to see trailer . Co-founder: Steve Wozniak is not a fan of the new Ashton Kutcher biopic of the late Steve Jobs . In character: Ashton Kutcher as Jobs (left) and at a premiere of the film earlier this month (right) The film only opened in the U.S. over the weekend, but has already garnered lukewarm reviews for its handling of the subject. 'I suspect a lot of what was wrong with the film came from Ashton's own image of Jobs,' wrote Wozniak. Kutcher spent three months preparing for his role as Jobs, including reading, watching and listening to all material about the tech visionary and even following the same extreme diet as Jobs. Making history: Ashton Kutcher as Steve Jobs, left, and Josh Gad as Steve Wozniak in a scene from 'Jobs' Early days: This shot of Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in the garage of Jobs' parents' house was taken in 1976 . The actor, who has said he cried the day Jobs died and that he 'loved a man he never knew,' has accused Wozniak of being in the pay of another film studio which is putting out its own Jobs movie, and said that he was 'extremely unavailable us when producing this film'. Wozniak responded that Kutcher's film had already been written - making his consultation unnecessary - and that he was 'turned off' by the Jobs script. Wozniak is reported to have met with Aaron Sorkin, who is adapting Walter Isaacson’s official biography of Jobs. Good apples: Wozniak (left) and Jobs (right) founded Apple in 1976 along with a third man, Ronald Wayne, whose role was glossed over in 'Jobs' He said Kutcher, who was also a producer on the film, must 'still be in character' to accuse him of disparaging the film for money from another movie studio. 1983: Steve Wozniak holds an Apple IIe, a variation on his best-selling Apple II . 'Either film would have paid me to consult,' he wrote, 'but the Jobs one already had a script written. I can't take that creative leadership from someone else. And I was turned off by the Jobs script. But I still hoped for a great movie.' Wozniak, offended by the inference that he would slander the film for money, mentioned an important part of Apple history that wasn't included in the film. 'When Apple decided not to reward early friends who helped, I gave them large blocks of my own stock. Because it was right. And I made it possible for 80 other employees to get some stock prior to the IPO so they could participate in the wealth,' he wrote. Wozniak challenged the film's accuracy - . which has also been derided by other critics - and said, 'I felt bad for . many people I know well who were portrayed wrongly in their . interactions with Jobs and the company.' Wozniak . also thinks the film was too easy on Jobs, who is glorified as a tech genius and businessman extraordinaire from the very beginning, when he didn't necessarily possess those skills, while other players in the Apple story weren't given credit in the film. Influenced: Wozniak says Kutcher's portrayal of Jobs was colored by the actor's own admiration for the tech entrepreneur . 'The movie ends pretty much where the great Jobs finally found product success and changed so many of our lives,' Wozniak wrote. 'I’m grateful to Steve for his excellence in the i-era, and his contribution to my own life of enjoying great products, but this movie portrays him having had those skills in earlier times.' Wozniak didn't comment on how he himself was portrayed in the film (by actor Josh Gad), but did have praise for the performances. 'I thought the acting throughout was good. I was attentive and entertained but not greatly enough to recommend the movie,' Wozniak wrote. 'One friend who is in the movie said he didn't want to watch fiction, so he wasn't interested in seeing it.' Wozniak was the designer of the Apple II computer and left Apple in 1987.","Kutcher plays Steve Jobs in the new biopic Jobs .

A series of eco-dwellings made from reclaimed materials and shaped like giant eggs have been created by designers. The houseboats, floating lodges and beach houses are to be crafted from reclaimed materials from a previous project by designers BMT Asia Pacific. The company had originally used the idea to build a dome to protect radar and radio antennae for a new landmark cruise liner terminal in Hong Kong. But they decided to give the concept a 'second life' after spending so much time creating, developing and sourcing material. BMT Asia Pacific have designed a series houseboats, floating lodges and beach houses which are in the shape of an egg . Managing director Richard Colwill said BMT looked at ways to use the two moulds which formed the dome. They examined the prospect of using them as swimming pools and temporary stages, but ended up creating the waterborne and coastal structures. The buildings, which are the first models in the Sea-Suite series, were designed by Richard Colwill and Henry Ward of Henry Ward Design. The first plan is for a floating lodge in the shape of the mould's original egg-like structure. The idea for the buildings came from a previous project to build a dome to protect radar and radio antennae for a cruise liner terminal in Hong Kong . A spokesman said: 'Expansive but shaded windows flood the 6m high lounge with light from either side, while decking creates easy access to the water. 'The luxury space is envisaged as easily at home along lake or river side, or a part of a cluster hotel or studio development. 'The high levels of roof insulation, moderation of temperature from its water setting and potential addition of solar panels to the expansive roof creates a sustainable unit for all climates.' Taking the concept a step further the design team went for a houseboat. The team even designed a houseboat, which was achieved by 'cracking' the egg . This was achieved by 'cracking' the egg, raising and separating the top shell, which has been sculpted to form a terracotta roof edged with flowing curves. This has created an airy loft style houseboat with stepped mezzanine levels leading up to a master bedroom, featuring expansive views through full height windows. Mr Colwill said the shape provided a number of exciting opportunities. He said: 'In the same way that an egg provides a flexible base for many recipes, we see countless opportunities in the development of this design for private or commercial use.'

The Navy has now decided to scrap the USS Miami due to budget cuts instead of fixing the nuclear submarine, which a civilian shipyard worker set fire to in 2012 because he wanted to go home early. Navy officials said repairing the Groton, Connecticut-based sub would have meant canceling work on dozens of other ships because of new budget constraints into which the Miami’s $450 million repairs just won’t fit. While Navy officials said the military's overall readiness would be compromised if the Miami were given precedence over so many other ships, several representatives in Congress were quick to criticize the decision. Scrapped: The USS Miami, a Los Angeles-class attack sub was set on fire by civilian shipyard worker Casey Fury in May 2012 and the Navy has now decided to scrap the vessel due to budget cuts . ‘The Navy and the nation simply cannot afford to weaken other fleet readiness in the way that would be required to afford repairs to Miami,’ said Rear Admiral Rick Breckenridge, director of undersea warfare. Pricey: Casey James Fury is now serving 17 years in federal prison after admitting he intentionally set the fire that caused $450 million in damage to the USS Miami . The Navy originally said it planned to repair the submarine but the discovery of additional damage raised the cost. The Los Angeles-class attack sub was commissioned in 1990 at a cost of $900 million . Shipyard worker Casey James Fury, of . Portsmouth, New Hampshire, was sentenced to 17 years in prison after . admitting he set fire to the Miami, which was in dry dock during a . 20-month overhaul at the Kittery shipyard. He said at the time that he was suffering from anxiety and having problems with his ex-girlfriend and set the blaze in order to get out of work early. It took 12 hours and the efforts of more than 100 firefighters to extinguish the flames. Seven people were hurt. The fire, set on May 23, 2012, . damaged forward compartments including living quarters, a command and . control center and the torpedo room. Weapons had been removed for the . repair, and the fire never reached the rear of the submarine, where the . nuclear propulsion components are located. U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King of Maine and Jeanne Shaheen and . Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire issued a statement blaming the decision to . scrap the submarine on the automatic budget cuts known as . sequestration. ‘We are . disappointed by the Navy's decision to discontinue repairs to the USS . Miami. Inactivating the Miami will mean a loss to our nuclear submarine . fleet — yet another unfortunate consequence of the across-the-board cuts . known as sequestration. We will continue to work together to find a . responsible budget solution that replaces sequestration,’ they said. Not worth it? Navy officials say repairing the USS Miami, seen here in a 2004 photo, would harm the military's overall readiness by taking resources away from dozens of other vessels in need of repair . Critics: Several U.S. lawmakers criticized the Navy's decision. 'Yet another unfortunate consequence of the across-the-board cuts known as sequestration,' wrote Senators Collins and Ayotte, among others . The Navy announced last summer that it intended to repair the Miami with a goal of returning it to service in 2015. The Navy said it would be cost-effective because the 23-year-old submarine could serve another 10 years. The decision to inactivate the Miami was a difficult one, ‘taken after hard analysis and not made lightly,’ Breckenridge said in his statement. ‘But in exchange for avoiding the cost of repairs, we will open up funds to support other vital maintenance efforts, improving the wholeness and readiness of the fleet.’ The repairs have potential implications for both Portsmouth Naval Shipyard workers and workers from Electric Boat in Groton, who expected to play a major role in the repair effort. U.S. Representative Chellie Pingree, whose Maine district includes the shipyard, blamed the submarine's loss on Congress' inability to come up with a budget. ‘It's outrageous that the yard won't get the chance to put the Miami back in service because of sequestration,’ she said. Farewell: It took 12 hours and 100 firefighters to stop the blaze at Kittery shipyard in New Hampshire.

Designer Randy Sarafan was inspired by the weird and wonderful hi-tech bras found in Syrian bazaars and has created a step-by-step guide on how to make your own. Scroll down for video . An artist from San Francisco has created a bra that can be undone simply by clapping, pictured. The battery-powered design uses an electromagnet built into the bra's fabric, covered with a bow. This magnet controls a switch which opens the clasp of the bra when someone claps nearby . The design sounds like something from a Carry On film (Barbara Windsor is pictured after her bra pings off during an exercise routine in Carry On Camping) Speaking on his Instructables post, Sarafan said: 'The first time I read about Syrian Lingerie I was quite moved. 'In the West, we often think of Arab cultures as sexually repressed societies, when - in fact - it turns out that they are clearly leaps and bounds ahead of us in advancements in lingerie technology. 'Henceforth, it became my mission to fast-forward lingerie technology in the West. 'I figured the first step in this critical mission was to replicate some of the advancements made in Syria. 'The article of lingerie that resonated most with my inner sensibilities was the clap-off bra. 'I immediately resolved to make my own clap-off bra as a springboard into Western lingerie innovation.' Other Syrian lingerie includes remote-controlled items and glow-in-the-dark bras and knickers. Although . created as a novelty item, Sarafan's technology could be used by . arthritis sufferers who find bra clasps difficult to use, as well as . people with physical disabilities. Although created as a novelty item, Sarafan's technology could be used by arthritis sufferers who find bra clasps difficult to use, as well as people with physical disabilities. Designer Randy Sarafan was inspired by the hi-tech bras found in Syrian bazaars and has created a step-by-step guide on how to make your own . The clap-off bra uses two circuit boards, an Arduino, a 28-pin socket, two 22pF capacitors, a 10uF capacitor, 1K, 10K and 100K resistors, a voltage regulator, nuts, bolts, a soldering iron and other items. Sarafan experimented with exploding clasps using nitrocellulose that would burn the thread holding the clasp away to remove the bra. He also tried using a metal coil called a solenoid, but the metal got too hot and could potentially burn the wearer. The full step-by-step guide, with pictures, are on Instructables. Cut the clasp off of the bra. Carefully break open the casing for the relay to expose the electromagnet. Put your relay into the center of a prototype circuit board and make cut marks around the outline of the relay. Cut two prototype circuit boards to size. One board should have a 1/4"" trimmed off of each long end, such that you are a left with a long strip. The other board should be cut to a small square using the markings you made in the outline of the relay. Put together the circuit using the 28-pin socket in place of the ATMEGA168 chip. Cut the ends off a USB cable to leave a section of cable roughly 6"" to 8"" long. Cut a small bow-tie shaped section of fabric that will fold over the front of the bra - the part the clamp is attached to. In the centre of this bow-tie cut a small opening and fasten a grommet. Insert a bolt through the grommet from the back towards the front and fasten it with a nut. Peel back the jacket of the USB cable to expose 4-coloured wires and attach these wires to the circuit board. Download Sarafan's code from his Instructables site and upload it to the Arduino board. Solder the wires to the circuit board. Sew down the electromagnet board to the fabric in the front of the bra where the clasp is attached. Sew the circuit board to the top of the back strap of the bra. Sew elastic straps perpendicular to the bra strap at the top and bottom and slide the 9V battery under the straps. Plug in the battery and put the bra on as per normal using the electromagnetic clasp. Clap twice to remove it. A variation of this clapping technology was used to develop the Clapper switch in the 1980s. The Clapper is a sound-activated electrical switch, sold by San Francisco-based Joseph Enterprises. The Smart Clapper can be used to control two electrical devices, based on if a person claps two or three times. The Clapper Plus has a remote control function in addition to sound-based activation. Customers have complained that the Clapper can sometimes be triggered by a dog's bark, knocking or clapping on television.","Designed by male designer after he was inspired by hi-tech Syrian lingerie .

Erik Norrie lost part of his leg after being bitten by a shark while fishing off the Abaco Islands in the Bahamas in front of his wife Spryng, four daughters and father-in-law. But Mr Norrie, from Largo, Florida, said the horrifying attack that has left him needing skin grafts to his damaged leg is only the latest in a string of rare incidents. Erik Norrie was attacked by a shark while vacationing in the Bahamas after previously surviving a lightning strike, a snake bite and being punched by monkeys twice . The back of his leg was bitten while he was fishing and Mr Norrie is now waiting for skin graft surgery . He has previously been struck by lightning, survived a rattlesnake bite and said he has been punched by monkeys twice. The odds of being attacked by a shark are about one in 11.5million and the chances of being struck by lightning in the U.S. is about one in 280,000. Despite his numerous brushes with death, Mr Norrie said it was the shark attack that he believed was going to kill him. He said he felt a crunch on the back of his leg during the trip on July 29 as he was returning to the family boat after snorkeling and spearfishing in the ocean. The father-of-four, pictured at Tampa General Hospital with a toy shark given by a friend, was able to tie rubber bands around his leg to stem the blood flow after the attack . Mr Norrie told Fox Tampa Bay: . 'As I look back, [the shark] was just finishing his bite and ripping . and swimming off, and you could see a piece of my leg in his mouth.' He said the shark began circling through the pool of blood when his father-in-law jumped into the water to get between him and the predator. Mr Norrie told the news station: 'I immediately threw the spear down with the fish because there was an enormous pool of blood around me and that shark was swimming all through the blood, sort of looking around, for more.' The father-of-four was able to tie rubber bands from his spear around his leg to try and stem the blood flow and his family called for help over the radio. Despite his numerous brushes with death, Mr Norrie said it was the shark attack, off the Abaco Islands, in the Bahamas (pictured), that he thought was going to kill him . A San Diego doctor arrived and accompanied Mr Norrie to a local hospital. The fisherman said: 'That was a tough ride. I really did think I was going to die.' The devout Christian credits his faith with helping him through the ordeal and said his daughters and wife prayed during the journey to hospital. Mr Norrie, who has been spearfishing since he was eight years old, is now recovering at Tampa General Hospital and is due to have multiple skin grafts to try to repair his injured leg.","Erik Norrie was bitten by the shark as he fished off Abaco Islands, Bahamas .

The BBC must reflect a wider range of views from across the country, the director-general admitted yesterday. Facing accusations of left-wing bias in its news coverage of a range of recent issues, Tony Hall admitted the corporation could have ‘responded quicker’ to some recent criticisms of bias and said it was ‘bound’ to get some  things wrong. He added: ‘We should avoid groupthink ... We should look to a range of voices and examples around the UK.’ Grilling: BBC Director-General Tony Hall answered questions in front of the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee on Tuesday . Lord Hall was grilled by MPs on the culture, media and sport committee, on a string of issues including the  severance pay scandal and the failed Digital Media Initiative (DMI), which wasted £100million. Appearing alongside him, BBC chairman Chris Patten admitted the corporation’s founder Lord Reith would be ‘turning in his grave’ at the revelations, and said the DMI fiasco was a ‘horror story’. Some of the most strident criticism came from Tory MP Philip Davies, who said the BBC was guilty of  imbalance in its recent coverage of political events such as welfare reform and benefits tourism. Mr Davies claimed BBC employees were naturally inclined to be left-wing, despite working for a supposedly impartial organisation. Insistent: Lord Hall said told the committee the BBC were 'always searching for impartiality' In a sarcastic aside, Mr Davies said Lord Hall had increased the number of left-wing employees at the BBC by appointing Blairites such as ex-Labour minister James Purnell and former spin doctor Godric Smith to senior management positions. Lord Hall conceded it was curious that the BBC buys more copies of  the left-leaning Guardian than any other newspaper. And he appeared to concede the BBC had made a mistake in describing the Government’s housing benefit reforms as a ‘bedroom tax’, which Mr Davies said was ‘clearly a political term’. The director-general said: ‘I absolutely want to get the terminology right ... We’ve got to find ways of describing controversial issues and I think you’re damned if you do, damned if you don’t.’ ‘Thank God we listened and said let’s change what we’re doing. Maybe we should have responded quicker but we responded.’ Lord Hall insisted: ‘We are always searching after impartiality, new  perspectives, new views. When we get things wrong, and we are bound to, let’s not keep looking over our shoulder. ‘Let’s make decisions on the basis we should get things right. But when we get things wrong, and we are bound to, we should admit it and move on.’ He added: ‘I also think we should do more on Europe. It’s a vital issue and reporting on Europe from Europe to the UK should be an important part of what we do.’ Lord Patten said only £3.8million of the £369million paid to departing staff over the past eight years was in excess of the BBC’s contractual obligations, and only that amount could be considered ‘waste’. It was just half the cost of broadcasting a Premier League football match, he added.","Tony Hall admitted BBC could have 'responded quicker' to criticisms .

Struck off: Thomas Floyd was once seen as a champion of dental care for poor children due to his willingness to accept Medicaid . A pediatric dentist who last year pleaded guilty to abusing a four-year-old patient already had a string of accusations on his record spanning eight years, which included hitting children with dental tools, calling them names and performing unnecessary dental work, it emerged today. Thomas Floyd, 62, from Florida, was arrested last September and, under a plea deal, was sentenced to five years probation and agreed to relinquish his dentist license. Under the agreement, the state agreed not to pursue additional charges against Floyd from any other known victims from his former dental practice. One of Floyd's former dental assistants told police the 62-year-old . jammed a dental tool into four-year-old boy's mouth with such force that blood . squirted out. Roger Zacharie told police last year: 'Blood squirted up. He'd slap again. Boom. ""Open up"". 'You know and then he's — he slapped one more time, which was the third slap. And I couldn't take it because blood squirted all on my shield and his shield.' For most of his career, which spanned three decades, Floyd was seen as a champion of dental care for poor children due to his willingness to accept Medicaid. But after a number of complaints of child abuse were lodged against him, the Department of Health launched an investigation. They found that in 2011, during a seven-month period alone, Floyd allegedly called children names, including 'cry baby', 'ape' and . 'brat', pinched a two-year-old and gave a four-year-old eight crowns without her parents' consent. The report also revealed the department received an anonymous complaint stating . Floyd abused children in his office 'by putting his hand over their . mouths and calling them names'. Documents obtained by the South Florida Sun Sentinel detail a string of allegations going as far back as 2001 with similar accusations. Claims: Children who were treated at Floyd's dental practice and their parents made various allegations over the last decade which included being hit by dental tools, being verbally abused and having healthy teeth extracted . One father said he took his child for a routine clean and check up and Floyd pulled three good teeth. 'It's horrifying that your daughter goes . in for a dental cleaning and comes out missing teeth,' the father . Benjamin Rodriguez told the Sun Sentinel. '[Floyd] just didn't care.' Eight former employees told police they saw . Floyd hit or become overly aggressive with crying and disabled children and would hit them with dental tools. The most recent police inquiry came . about in February 2012 when the mother of a seven-year-old girl reported to . police that her daughter went to have four teeth extracted and came out . with beads from her braids missing and her clothes wet. Rovenia Gerald told the Sun Sentinel that Floyd had stuffed a . dental bib in her daughter's mouth to stop her from screaming and told . her, 'Shut up you damn brat!' According to the investigation released by the Department of Health, 'Floyd’s behavioral control methods with his patients fall well below acceptable standards of practice in treating pediatric patients'. Floyd's attorney said the allegations stem from disgruntled former employees and those of his ex-wife, who is an orthodontist. Floyd himself said he was the victim of a 'witch hunt', in a letter he sent to the Florida Department of Health last year, and claimed his Medicaid patients who had severe dental, medical and behavioral problems oftentimes had difficult parents.","Thomas Floyd pleaded guilty last year to abusing a four-year-old patient .

He ruled over a socialist paradise and promised his people trapped behind the Berlin Wall he would always be there for them. But that never stopped East German leader Erich Honecker from building an emergency exit - just in case things did not go as planned. Now the escape tunnel he constructed in the middle of Berlin has been discovered and opened to the public. Scroll down for video... Secret tunnel: The 150ft escape route was constructed by East German leader Erich Honecker in case his people ever turned against him . Escape plans: East German leader Erich Honecker had the tunnel constructed so he could flee if 'things' did not go to plan . His fall, when it came in 1989, was so swift that he never got the chance to flee through the 150ft long bolt-hole constructed beneath the Schlossplatz in the east of the city. It led from his office in the former Palace of the Republic - known to all as 'Erich's Lampshop' due to the number of lights inside - to an exit in the former royal stables of the German emperors at the edge of the Spree river. The plan was for him and his politburo friends to high-tail it on a boat to sail away should the cold war turn hot and the city fall to the capitalists. Christof Fröschl, in charge of the stables, is now the guide for the tunnel constructed out of reinforced concrete. Oppressed: East Germans walk near Check Point Charlie in 1985 . He said: 'It was an escape tunnel specifically for Honecker and his highest aides in the event of a calamity overcoming the German Democratic Republic.' The tunnel was made from the same reinforced concrete used for the numerous nuclear bunkers Honecker had built across his land. Constructed: August 13, 1961 . Second wall built June 1962 . Third generation wall in 1965 . Final wall built in 1975 . Torn down in 1989 . Border length: 96 miles . Watch towers: 302 . Bunkers: 20 . Persons killed: 192 . Persons injured by shooting: 200 . It exited in the only building left of the Kaiser's former city palace. The communists blew up the heavily war-damaged building in 1950 because they deemed it a symbol of 'decadent imperialism'. It was built in the 1970's - a time when the Soviets still controlled East Germany. It was when people were being shot every week at the Berlin Wall and the 'velvet revolution' of 1989 that would eventually cause the demise of both Honecker and his totalitarian nation seemed unthinkable. Squads of Stasi secret police labourers built the tunnel under the strictest secrecy. It would have been unthinkable to let the people, or the west, know that such paranoia existed in the politburo. Berlin authorities intend to rebuild the so-called Stadtschloss in the near future - funds permitting. They will then use the former escape tunnel as an underground access path for workers to get to the nearby state library. Honecker ruled from 1971 until 1989. He died, aged 81, in the Chilean capital of Santiago in 1994.",But Erich Honecker never got to use it when he fell from power in 1989 .

Arms wrapped around each other for balance as their wheelbarrow taxi bumps along a jungle path, these adorable baby apes are on their way to their own private patch of rainforest — all thanks to the generosity of Daily Mail readers. Wonder is written on their faces as they peer over the edge of the barrows to see what might be around the next corner. One particularly curious passenger seems in danger of falling out as he leans precariously over the front wheel. Baby orangutans are moved into the new International Animal Rescue centre at Ketapang in Borneo . The adorable baby apes are on their way to their own private patch of rainforest - all thanks to the generosity of Daily Mail readers . When they reach their destination, in the middle of Borneo’s lush jungle, sheer excitement gets the better of them. They spill out, tumbling over each other in a tangle of skinny, red limbs, eager to explore. It’s mayhem, until their keepers — wearing facemasks to avoid passing on human germs — are able to round them up, and lead them by the hands to the trees where they can swing from branches, forage for food and learn to live as wild orangutans. Life could have been very different for these affectionate and trusting babies, who hand-in-hand with their human guardians, look uncannily like a group of nursery school children on a day out. It seems impossible to believe that, without the support provided by your donations, they would have been doomed to a wretched existence in captivity, half-starved, beaten and living in chains as illegal trophy pets.

They are the victims of logging . companies who are destroying their habitat in Borneo and of hunters who . kill adult orangutans and sell the babies to the black-market pet trade, . where they fetch high prices. Life in captivity is harsh. Chained up, underfed, mistreated and beaten by their owners — and sometimes tormented by local children — pet orangutans in Borneo rarely live to be fully grown. Females mature sometime between the ages of six and 11 but males are not fully adult until they are 15. Since the appeal was published in the Mail two years ago, £500,000 has been raised to enable the International Animal Rescue charity (IAR) to build an orangutan sanctuary on 64 acres in Sungai Awan, Indonesian Borneo. The red-haired babies sleep in a safe compound each night, and go out to play and rediscover their freedom in the forest enclosure every day. Their feet are really a second pair of hands, made for holding and grasping branches rather than taking a stroll. So local volunteers load their charges into wheelbarrows and trundle them to the trees . But this is much more than primate playtime — it’s essential for their health because orangutans aren’t built for walking. They are tree-dwelling animals, uncomfortable on the ground, and their legs are not designed to take their weight for any distance, especially when they are young and still developing. Their feet are really a second pair of hands, made for holding and grasping branches rather than taking a stroll. So local volunteers load their charges into wheelbarrows and trundle them to the trees.  When evening falls, the one-wheeled taxi service is back again to take them home to bed. Alan Knight, the chief executive of IAR, says: ‘For every baby orangutan at the centre, a mother orangutan has died, not to mention all the males that must also have been killed.’ Without urgent action, orangutans could soon be extinct in the wild . Two years ago, the Mail highlighted the plight of a female orangutan called Mely. She had been captured 15 years earlier and kept as a pet by a fisherman who had shot her mother. Chained up on the verandah of a hut, Mely survived on the scraps thrown to her by tourists. Help poured in from Mail readers and IAR was able to save Mely and dozens of others. But there’s more still to do. In the wild, these creatures can travel up to 3.5km a day through the tree canopy, so the charity’s ambitious plan is to buy land off the coast of Borneo and create entire island sanctuaries, where Mely and others can be gradually reintroduced to the wild.

Help poured in from Mail readers and IAR was able to save Mely and dozens of others . Land in Southeast Asia is cheap, by Western standards. One island for six orangutans would cost about £12,000 — but running costs are much higher, an estimated £50,000 a year. The work is vital. Thanks to the destruction of their rainforest habitat by timber companies and palm oil growers, as well as the cruel pet trade, orangutan numbers have plummeted from 315,000 in 1990 to fewer than 50,000 today. Without urgent action, orangutans could soon be extinct in the wild. And joyous scenes like this will be nothing but painful reminders that with a little determination we could have done much more to save them.
