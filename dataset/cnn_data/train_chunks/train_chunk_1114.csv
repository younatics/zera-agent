"Rangers caretaker boss Kenny McDowall has sensationally revealed that he has been told he must play the five Newcastle loan players added to his squad on transfer deadline day. The Toon quintet of Slovenian playmaker Haris Vuckic, English defender Remie Streete, Burundi-born midfielder Gael Bigirimana, Swiss defender Kevin Mbabu and Northern Ireland winger Shane Ferguson have joined the Ibrox club until the end of the campaign. Newcastle and Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley is a shareholder at Rangers with an 8.92 per cent stake, and he and Rangers face hearings before the Scottish Football Association in March over the tycoon's possible breaches of dual interest rules. Newcastle have loaned Gael Bigirimana (left) Remie Streete (centre) and Haris Vuckic to Rangers . Bigirimana has the most Premier League experience of the loanees with 13 appearances and one goal . Vuckic was once tipped as one of European football's next big talents and had a trial at AC Milan . Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley faces a hearing with the Scottish FA over his involvement with Rangers . Speaking at the Murray Park training centre, McDowall, who has signaled his intent to leave at the end of the season, said: 'On Monday night I got a call from Derek (Llambias, Rangers chief executive) saying he had secured five players on loan. 'Three of them arrived and two of them will be coming the next three or four weeks - they are injured. 'When I was given the job I was told players incoming and outgoing wouldn't be my responsibility. 'I take the team and coach the team and I am more than happy to get on with it. Asked if he was duty-bound to play them, he replied: 'Yes.' Then asked if he had to play every one of them every week, he again, replied: 'Yes. They are obviously good players - they play for Newcastle. I will carry on and do what I am told to do.' Rangers caretaker boss has confirmed that he must play the five Newcastle loan players in the first team . Northern Ireland winger Shane Ferguson has also joined Rangers on loan until the end of the season . With Newcastle players now moving to Rangers on loan, Mike Ashley's interest in the club continues to grow . Gael Bigirimana: The 21-year-old has made 26 appearances for Newcastle since arriving from Coventry City in 2012 for £1m. After impressing during his first season, the Burundi-born midfielder - likened to Cheick Tiote - has failed to progress and was soon demoted to the reserves. Haris Vuckic: The playmaker joined Newcastle from Domzale in 2009 - after they beat off competition from AC Milan - but he has struggled with injuries, damaging his knee and ankle ligaments in one match for Slovenia Under 19s. He has previously been loaned out to Rotherham United and Cardiff City. Kevin Mbabu: The 19-year-old Swiss defender joined Newcastle's academy in January, 2013 but is yet to make an appearance for the first team. Remie Streete: English centre back Streete is a product of the club's youth system and joined them as a 13-year-old. He was loaned to Port Vale earlier this season. He was highly-rated all through his progression at the academy but now looks set to leave the club in the summer. Shane Ferguson: Northern Ireland winger Ferguson has made 30 appearances for Newcastle and, under Alan Pardew, enjoyed a run in the side in 2012. He lost his place, however, and hasn't featured for the first team in nearly two years. He also has 18 senior caps for his country.","Rangers have loaned five players from Newcastle until the end of the season .

"Recently the Duchess of Cambridge returned to work for the first time since succumbing to severe morning sickness – and in true royal style hit the ground running with a succession of appearances. But while she looked every inch the glamorous princess on the Tuesday at an awards ceremony at the Natural History Museum, on Wednesday during an Action on Addiction gala dinner fashion watchers described her as looked rather more washed out. Why? Is it because she was attending her third event in two days. Because she is the mother of a 15-month-old toddler? Or because she is 13 weeks pregnant with her second child? None of the above according to certain style experts, who say it is because she doesn't always choose colours that suit her complexion. Scroll down for video . According to Colour Analysts the Duchess of Cambridge looks her best in the cool soft tones of 'summer colours', like the like the baby blue gown she wore for the Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2014 Awards Ceremony (left) whilst harsh black, like the Temperley cocktail dress she wore for a gala dinner on Wednesday (right) can make her look washed out . Colour analyst Melissa Nicholson, of Kettlewell Colours, has identified the shades that compliment Kate’s skin tone and says they are from the 'summer' palette, which means she looks her best in clothes with a blue tint rather than a yellow one. ‘It is quite obvious that Kate is a summer,’ she said. ‘I would say her best shades are French navy, airforce blue, aubergine, plum, burgundy, soft berry and grey (anything from silver to slate). 'Spring colours are too bright and playful for Kate, winter colours too overpowering and autumn colours are too heavy and boring. The summer colours accentuate her natural beauty – she looks sophisticated and elegant in cool soft tones.’ According to Melissa, people who want to look their best – like Kate – should visit a professionally-trained colour analyst, who will put swatches of fabric against your skin to find out which season you are. Certainly 'having your colours done' is the latest craze on Mumsnet. 'If you have blue tones in your skin, you are either summer or winter,’ she explains. ‘Both tend to suit the cooler, silver jewellery and colours that have a blue tint rather than a yellow tint. 'Winter can wear more intense bold colours in high contrast – black and white, dark navy, fuchsia, scarlet - while summer look better in a softer blend of colours – grey, plum, powder pink, French navy, berry tones dusted with icing sugar. 'If you have warmer, yellow tones in your skin, you are likely to be either spring or autumn. They tend to look better in gold jewellery and colours that have a yellow tint rather than a blue one. 'Autumn colours are earthier shades with a hint of black in them – browns, russets, olive greens. Spring colours, on the other hand, are brighter, fresher and more playful – yellows, corals and turquoise blues.’ From the glamorous burgundy coat chosen for her first Christmas at Sandringham to the yellow Emilia Wickstead coat worn to a Buckingham Palace garden party last summer, FEMAIL reveals the Duchess's best style hits (and a few misses) with colour analyst ratings... 10/10 LOOKING GOOD IN BLUE: Kate chose French Navy both during her 2011 visit to Quebec (left) and her engagement photocall in Novemeber 2010 (right). Expert Melissa Nicholson says: 'French navy is a cool mid-tone blue but with just the right amount of depth to give Kate a glow.’ 10/10 BEAUTIFUL IN BURGUNDY: Kate looks much better in this wine colour for her first Christmas Day at Sandringham in 2011 (left) rather than the brown coat she wore in Grimsby in 2013 (right). The expert's verdict: 'Dark pink berry tones compliment her natural colouring and are sensational for Kate. The cool tones of the plum coat compliment Kate much better than the warm mahogany colour.' 9/10 GLAMOROUS IN TWEED: Kate wore this Missoni blue tweed M dress and Rachel Trevor Morgan hat when she joined the Queen and Prince Philip during the Diamond Jubilee tour . The verdict? ‘The tone-tone effect of the tweed creates a softer look and compliments Kate beautifully.’ ELEGANT IN SILVER: The Duchess wore this subtle shade for the UK's Creative Industries Reception at the Royal Academy of Arts  London in 2012 which Melissa describes as a 'winning colour on Kate' 9/10 LOOKING STUNNING IN GREYS: Kate chose this cool tone for both an  Easter Sunday service at St Andrew’s Cathedral in Sydney 2014 (left) and Emerging from the plane at LAX airport on her first overseas tour in July 2011 (right). The expert says: ‘Soft grey looks sophisticated on Kate and evens out her skin tone.’ 8/10: MUTED EVENING WEAR: Kate wore a stunning dusky pink gown to a gala dinner in Kensington Palace in June 2011 (left) and a soft lilac  to a 2011 gala in LA. Melissa says: 'Soft, delicate and sheer also works well for Kate, while soft lilac is a sophisticated alternative to white.’ 7/10 BEAUTIFUL IN BERRY: Kate chose a brighter shade when she visited her new portrait, hung at the National Portrait Gallery London by artist Paul Emsley in 2013 and the expert says 'Soft berry reds  are better than vibrant orange reds' 6/10: CREAM SHADES: For both the Diamond Jubilee service (left) and a dinner at Thirty Club at Claridges in May 2012  (right) Kate wore off-white. However the expert says: 'Soft white is preferable to optic white although we feel Kate needs a little more colour to look her best.’ 5/10 WHITE Kate wore this  Alexander McQueen white broderie anglaise suit when visiting the Rolls Royce jet engine factory in Singapore in September 2012. What the experts say: ‘Swap optic white for a soft white or soft grey and this outfit would be a winner.’ 4/10 CANDY CANE COLOURS: This Reiss £159 white Nanette engagement dress and Sylvia Fletcher at Lock & Co red hat with maple leaf which Kate wore for Canada Day celebrations July 2011. But Melissa says: ‘You see the hat first! Red and white is too contrasting for Kate.’ 3/10: Melissa thinks this Ralph Lauren £350 olive green turtle-neck dress (left) 'looks heavy on Kate' . While the mint green Burberry coat (right) is ‘an uncomfortable combination of both colour and style. A grey taupe hat with an airforce blue jacket would be a better combination.’ 2/10 AN EARTHY DISAPPOINTMENT : This green Emilia Wickstead coat dress with Lock & Co £245 brown ‘Betty Boop’ hat were worn by Kate  at St Patrick’s Day  2013. What the experts say: ‘The combination of brown and green are too earthy and detract from her natural style.’ 1/10 YUCKY IN YELLOW: This Emilia Wickstead bespoke coat in yellow silk was worn to the Buckingham Palace Garden Party in May 2013 but Melissa says: ‘Acid yellow is harsh, bright and overbearing on Kate.’","According to colour analyst Melissa Nicholson, the Duchess is a 'summer' which means she has cool-toned skin .
Colours that look good on her include all shades of grey, French navy, plum, burgundy and soft berry shades .
Those who boast cool 'winter' colouring can wear more intense colours such as black, fuschia and scarlet .
Warm-toned 'spring' and 'autumn' colouring needs yellow-based shades, for example russet or olive green ."
"MPs were embroiled in yet another expenses row today after it emerged that 27 are letting out their London homes at the same time as claiming taxpayers' money to rent elsewhere in the city. Former defence secretary Liam Fox, shadow ministers Andy Burnham, Jim Murphy and Chris Bryant, and Communities Minister Don Foster are among those listed as raking in income from properties while receiving up to £20,000 a year in expenses. They have been using a loophole that was opened when expenses rules were changed after the 2009 scandal, because so many were fiddling the system. Claims: (top left to bottom right) Liam Fox, Andy Burnham Jim Murphy and Chris Bryant have all been letting out their homes while using taxpayers' money to rent elsewhere in London, research has found . Although the practice does not break any . rules, it will fuel concerns that politicians are still able to profit . from Commons allowances. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority’s (Ipsa) blanket ban on MPs claiming mortgage interest came into effect this summer. They are now only permitted to receive up to £20,000 expenses for renting. The move was intended to head off criticism after the scandal three years ago showed politicians had been using public money to build up property portfolios. However, it also appears to have created an incentive for many to vacate homes they own. Research by the Daily Telegraph identified Tory MPs David Amess and Peter Luff, and Liberal Democrat ex-defence minister Nick Harvey among those letting out properties in the capital while also claiming expenses for renting. The names could only be deduced because Ipsa last night released partial postcodes of taxpayer-funded second homes - which could then be cross-referenced with the parliamentary register of interests. The disclosure followed linked concerns that MPs are able to exploit a “loophole” in the rules to rent properties to colleagues, who then claim the costs on expenses. Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, is attempting to stop the release of MPs' landlords . It is understood that four MPs are currently renting from four other MPs - although there are no cases of home “swaps”. Linda Riordan, the Labour MP for Halifax, lets her London flat to fellow Labour MP Iain McKenzie for £18,720 a year.. Mr McKenzie said: 'If I had known beforehand that the flat was owned by an MP then I probably wouldn’t have taken it. 'You’ve got to apply the test of how it looks to the man in the street, regardless of whether it’s above board or not.' Yesterday, Commons Speaker John Bercow was accused of trying to suppress details of the matter after warning Ipsa that revealing the identities of politicians’ landlords would be a 'security risk'. The watchdog had been due to disclose the material in response to another Freedom of Information (FOI) request. However, the process has now been put on hold in the wake of Mr Bercow’s intervention. In a letter to Ipsa, Mr Bercow insisted there was a 'very real danger' that MPs’ residential addresses could be discovered as a result of the planned publication. Responding to the Speaker’s letter last night, Sir Ian Kennedy, chairman of Ipsa, insisted the authority 'would not, under any circumstances, release the full address' of an MP. But he added: 'The policy also makes clear that we would release, on request, the names of landlords and other suppliers of goods and services where this was in support of a claim made under the scheme for business costs and expenses.' Property: The socialist MP for Halifax Linda . Riordan, left and the £400,000 London flat, right, which she rents to . fellow Labour MP Iain McKenzie for £1,560 a month . Sir Ian said all affected MPs had been contacted, asking if they had concerns about the release of their landlord’s details. When details of the expenses scandal broke in 2009 it came out that dozens of MPs 'flipped' their second home allowance from . one property to another to use taxpayers' money to cover their mortgage payments and pay for improvements before making a hefty profit if they sold them. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority phased out these payments in the aftermath of the revelations, with the transitional period for these ending this summer, following concerns that politicians were able to build up valuable property empires using the public purse. Now they can only claim for rent, up to £20,000 per year, but this loophole appears to allow them to continue building up a portfolio of homes. Some feel it is better for them financially to rent out their own home to cover their mortgage and use the new allowance to rent another property. However, only a third - 110 - replied. Some 60 have indicated they have no problems with the disclosure, and 50 expressed reservations. 'We are therefore delaying our response to the FOI request and will be writing to those MPs concerned to give them a further two weeks to respond,' he said. Tory Sarah Wollaston said she had grave concerns about revealing MPs’ addresses, having had her London flat and constituency home broken into. The Totnes MP said she agreed with the need for transparency, but was worried about a tiny minority of people, including activists, using the information maliciously. Dr Wollaston said: 'I am very happy for everyone to know that I have no connection with my landlord in my London address - I have never met them and I don’t think they even live in this country. 'But if they (Ipsa) publish politicians’ home addresses then you are exposing them (MPs) to very difficult situations.' Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: “If MPs are again found to have exploited the expenses system, it will be another stain on the reputation of Parliament. 'It was the cry that ‘it’s all within the rules’ combined with attempts to suppress the publication of claims that made the MPs’ expenses crisis three years ago so toxic. Whilst the rules may not technically prevent MPs from renting properties to one another, it is certainly against the spirit of those rules. 'The public’s faith was left in tatters in 2009 and the latest allegations could endanger much of the work that has been done since then to restore public confidence in our politicians. 'It is vital that there is total transparency in all matters relating to MPs’ taxpayer-funded expenses and allowances.'","Defence secretary Liam Fox, shadow ministers Andy Burnham, Jim Murphy and Chris Bryant using legal loophole .

"An elderly man who was locked in a Houston garage for more than a year so his captor could allegedly cash in his welfare checks has died a week after he was freed. William Merle Greenawalt, 79, was one of three men held captive in the garage without beds or bathrooms on July 19, police said. A fourth man was found in the property's house. Their alleged captor, 31-year-old Walter Renard Jones, beat Greenawalt with a cane, according to the felony complaint. The man died on July 25 and his cause of death has not been released. Greenawalt was found in a garage that authorities have called a 'dungeon'. The men were forced to sleep on the filthy floor, had no restroom, were only given scraps of food and there was a variety of locks on the door to keep them inside, court records show. Tragic: Four elderly men were discovered held against their wills in 'deplorable' conditions at a home in Houston, pictured, earlier this month. Police have now said that one of the men has died . Another man was discovered in the house, where Jones lived with his grandmother. He said he had been held at the home for around six months. They were found after a neighbor tipped off police, who arrived to carry out a welfare check. Police found the garage door nailed shut and had to break burglar bars on the window to reach the men. Charged: Walter Jones, 31, was charged with injury to the elderly after the grim discovery . The converted garage . had no furniture except for one chair, a malfunctioning air conditioning . unit, . and was filthy, with police describing it to ABC 13 as like 'a warehouse for people'. The men were so badly malnourished that hey were carried from the home on stretchers and hospitalized. The two others - Dean Cottingham, 59, . and John Edward Padget, 64 - have now been released to the custody of Adult . Protective Services. It is believed they were homeless before the ordeal. They told police that Jones persuaded them to move into the house in exchange for shelter and food, but they were locked in and forced to turn over their Social Security and veteran's benefit checks. 'They were . apparently given scraps to eat,' police spokesman Jodi Silva said. 'Very little food was being . provided to them. They didn't have access to a restroom. 'They clearly stated to us they were being kept against their will.' The fourth man, who was living at the house, allegedly told officers he did not want to leave. In custody: A man believed to be Jones sits in a police car. The captives were lured inside under the promise of cigarettes and alcohol while the captor used them to cash their government assistance checks . Jones was arrested on July 19 and charged with injury to the elderly by act and injury to the elderly by omission. Police have not said whether they would upgrade the charges in light of the death. It is not . yet known if four women who had been living in the main part of the . house, owned by Jones' grandmother Essie Mae Scranton, were also being held captive. Three of them were said to have disabilities and mental illness, and the fourth was described as a caregiver. Adult Protective Services has been called to help in the investigation. Red flag: Police found the alleged victims during a welfare check, after a tip off from a neighbor . Little explanation: No names of individuals involved have been released, but police described the building where the men were being held as being 'deplorable conditions' Harris County court records show that Jones has a criminal record extending back to 2001 and has previously been arrested for theft and possession of marijuana. In 2009, a grand jury indicted him on a charge of failing to register as a sex offender after he was convicted in juvenile court in 1997 of two counts of felony aggravated sexual assault of a child. But this 2009 charge was eventually dismissed for lack of evidence, court records show, NBC News reported. Details: The Houston Police Department spokeswoman Jodi Silva said the men were given little food and had no access to a restroom as she spoke to the media after the discovery .","William Merle Greenawalt, 79, died a week after he was found locked in a garage where he was given little food and had no bed or restroom .

"Leyton Orient will insist on Russell Slade quitting the club if he wants to take the reins at Cardiff. The Championship club, who sacked Ole Gunnar Solskjaer last week, are keen on Slade replacing the former Manchester United manager. Orient have already blocked two approaches from Cardiff, and will insist that the manager resigns from his current role if he wants to join Cardiff. Russell Slade waves to the Leyton Orient away fans before kick-off against Sheffield United on Tuesday . Slade could quit Leyton Orient and move to Cardiff, who are keen on acquiring the 53-year-old's services . The east London club's stance leaves Slade in a somewhat awkward position knowing he is not guaranteed the Cardiff job. Slade celebrates 20 years in management this month, and has been in charge of seven clubs during his career. He joined Leyton Orient in April 2010 with the club facing relegation to League Two, but managed to bring them to 17th and safety in League One. From there Slade has built on his first-season success, culminating in a third-place finish last season. Orient missed out in the play-off final, losing to Rotherham in a penalty shoot-out, and will look to try again this season - but whether that will be with Slade at the helm remains to be seen.

"Whether it’s playing peek-a-boo, tickling their tummy or blowing raspberries, parents usually have a failsafe formula for making their baby chuckle. What most of us probably haven’t done is stopped to think about why babies laugh at these things. Step forward Dr Caspar Addyman, a Research Fellow at London Birkbeck University’s Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development — or the BabyLab as it has been dubbed. He is overseeing one of the biggest studies into what makes babies laugh, and why. Scroll down for video . Groundbreaking: Dr Caspar Addyman is running the world's largest study into why babies laugh and why . ‘Understanding babies also helps us understand adults,’ he says. ‘Babies are little scientists. They are discovering the world and through them we can discover a great deal, too.’ So passionate is he that Dr Addyman — a banker turned psychologist who doesn’t have any children — is funding the research himself. He’s created a detailed questionnaire for parents, as well as asking them to send in videos and short reports of what makes their babies laugh. So far, 1,400 parents from 25 countries have answered questions ranging from whether their baby was more likely to laugh at a particular time of day to which toys and nursery rhymes they found funniest. ‘We also asked whether they found Mummy or Daddy funniest and what the baby’s general temperament was. We are also working on a separate questionnaire to work out whether there is a correlation between laughing babies and a calmer temperament,’ Dr Addyman told the Mail. ‘The big surprise has been that, contrary to general perception, laughter is present from a very early age,’ he says. 'Ninety per cent of babies have smiled in the first two months and laughed just a few weeks after that, while we have had reports from parents that their baby has laughed unambiguously at just a few weeks old. Babies cry to make you stop what you're doing. But laughter is their way of telling you to continue . ‘Equally, a small number reported their baby didn’t laugh at all for the first 12 months. This suggests babies have a range of temperaments that are present from early on.’ Happily, mums and dads appear to score equally when it comes to making a baby chortle. However, it’s the boys who seem to have the biggest sense of humour, with parents reporting their sons laughed nearly 50 times a day in contrast to a mere 37 for daughters. ‘This could be reinforced by the behaviour of parents,’ says Dr Addyman. ‘If you think your boy baby is laughing more, you may try to make them laugh more.’ ‘Crying is a signal they want something . to change, while smiling or laughter is the opposite — it says keep . doing what you’re doing.’ - Dr Caspar Addyman . As the mother of a perennially giggly ten-month-old girl, I don’t agree with the gender divide theory. Connie started to chuckle at five months, and laughs at anything from the light being turned on to us being stuck in a traffic jam. Dr Addyman isn’t surprised in the least. ‘Laughter is foremost a social thing. You laugh in company,’ he says. 'One of the clearest bits of evidence we’ve found is that it is not necessarily what you are doing, but the fact you are present with your baby that’s important — that is why they are happy. ‘The interesting thing, too, is that most parents play games instinctively because babies have an amazing way of getting adults to do stupid things that benefit everyone. 'It makes them laugh, but it is a bonding experience, too, which is really important.’ Moreover, in the first year, smiles and tears are a baby’s only way of communicating. ‘Crying is a signal they want something to change, while smiling or laughter is the opposite — it says keep doing what you’re doing.’ The parents of three-week-old Cosmo sent the BabyLab a series of pictures clearly showing him laughing as they tickled him, challenging the idea that babies don’t laugh until they are older. ‘The first way to get babies to laugh is through touch,’ says Dr Addyman. ‘Tickling has deep evolutionary roots that come from being a mammal. It’s partly related to grooming, a vital function that is also pleasurable.’ And as grown-ups know, tickling stimulates different nerve endings, which we normally react to with laughter. Less surprising was that the laughter was linked to parental touch. ‘A professor once said the first joke humans ever make is going to tickle your baby then waiting, never quite getting to the point of tickling. It’s true — it doesn’t take long for a baby to respond to the anticipation of being tickled as much as the act itself.’ Like many babies, four-month-old Frederick always laughs when he sees himself in a mirror — though, as Dr Addyman explains, it’s not for the reason that parents tend to think. ‘Research suggests that babies don’t recognise themselves in the mirror until they are at least 18 months old,’ he says. What’s so funny, then? Dr Addyman believes that the mirroring of expressions breaks natural social conventions, and babies find this funny. ‘Conversation and social interaction involve turn-taking, but the person in the mirror is breaking these conventions by doing everything at the same time.’ Hence the hilarity. Polly, aged 11 months, laughs  a lot in the bath, upholding Dr Addyman’s theory of parental interaction being key to baby laughter. ‘A lot of parents report that their babies find bathtime funny, which I think is again linked to the supervising adult’s undivided attention,’ he says. ‘But it’s also down to sensory pleasure. Water is warm and womb-like. They also get pleasure from simple, elemental feelings and sensations. 'One of the nicest reports was from a mum who told us her baby laughs wholeheartedly when she stands under the shower after she’s lifted out of the swimming pool. ‘She described it as a laugh of sheer joy at being in the world and I think there is an element of that about being in the bath.’ No parent will be surprised to hear that peek-a-boo tops the worldwide list of laughter-making games. Dr Addyman believes it works because it is intensely interactive and also a game that can develop over time. ‘A young baby has no concept of time, so each time someone or something returns that has disappeared it is a shock. 'And because peek-a-boo has their much-loved parents “coming back”, it’s a happy shock for the baby. 'Over time the game becomes more sophisticated because babies develop a sense that you will come back — so it becomes about anticipation, the fun that is still to come heightens their amusement. ‘When they grow into toddlers, they realise they can make you disappear and reappear if they cover their own eyes, as with this little girl. So, in microcosm, peek-a-boo shows how a child develops.’ Parents overwhelmingly reported that dolls and puppets were their baby’s funniest toys, as three-month-old Sienna demonstrates here. ‘Early on, babies seem to understand at some deep level that their toys are not real beings, but are still able to have a degree of empathy with them,’ says Dr Addyman. ‘And they also seem to find the incongruity of an animal or inanimate toy behaving in a human fashion very amusing. ‘As with peek-a-boo, it’s because their parent is there as part of  the game, too, orchestrating  the interaction.’ My daughter, Connie, is endlessly delighted by her rattle, when she shakes it and when I shake it for her, writes Kathryn Knight. I wonder why it is this, of all her toys, that pleases her most. ‘Sometimes a baby’s laughter is triumphant — a form of “I have made this happen,’’ ’ says Dr Addyman. ‘And sometimes it can just be because there is a pleasing noise or sensation that is new to them. I think there can be a cause-and-effect connection, too. ‘One of the videos we’ve been sent is of a baby laughing when their  parent presses a light switch and the light comes on and goes off. It’s hilarious every time, and it is the same thing with a noisy rattle. ‘Connie probably doesn’t quite understand what she — or you — is doing to make it noisy, but is nonetheless delighted it makes a noise.’","Dr Caspar Addyman running the 'BabyLab' studying why babies laugh .

"Dogs have been man’s best friends for 30,000 years - and now scientist think they know why. Canines respond to emotions in the voice in the same way that humans do, research shows. The first study to compare the brains of humans with any nonprimate animal shows that dogs have dedicated voice areas in their brains, just as people do. Not a CAT scan: Hungarian scientists have shown that that dogs have dedicated voice areas in their brains, just as people do. Here the dogs are pictured after their time in the fMRI scanner . Recent research suggests what dog owners knew all along – that they do in fact experience feelings of love and affection. Scientists at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, discovered that a part of the brain associated with positive emotions, is similar in dogs and humans. They too used fMRI scanners to examine canine brain activity. Using hand signals to indicate the dogs were about to receive a food treat, the researchers showed that the caudate nucleus, a part of the brain associated with positive emotions, was similar in dogs and humans. If, as many scientists have argued in the past, it is all simply about [getting] food for dogs then the reaction in their brains would be the same no matter who or what is offering them the food,’ said neuroscientist Gregory Berns. ‘We hope to show that they love us for things far beyond food, basically the same things that humans love us for, like social comfort and social bonds.’ Crucially, dog brains respond to acoustic cues of emotion in the same way as people. Attila . Andics, leader of the Hungarian research group which carried out the . study, said: ‘Dogs and humans share a similar social environment. ‘Our findings suggest that they also use similar brain mechanisms to process social information. ‘This may support the successfulness of vocal communication between the two species.’ The . research, published in the journal Current Biology, suggests that voice . areas evolved 100 million years ago, the age of the last common ancestor . of humans and dogs. Canines were first domesticated by humans in Ice Age Europe up to 32,000 years ago, scientists think. Genetic evidence discovered last year suggests the wolf ancestors of today’s dogs were most likely tamed by hunter-gatherers. For the latest study, Dr Andics and his colleagues trained 11 dogs to lay motionless in an MRI brain scanner. That . made it possible to run the same neuroimaging experiment on both dog . and human participants - something that had never been done before. In the experiment, scientists captured both dogs' and humans' brain activities while the subjects listened to nearly 200 dog and human . sounds, ranging from whining or crying to playful barking or laughing . Ethologist Marta Gacsi (R) talks to Walter, a Golden Retriever, before an examination as part of the project . They . captured both dog and human brain activities while the subjects . listened to 200 dog and human sounds, ranging from whining or crying to . playful barking or laughing.

"Many men are battling a paunch when they hit 30, but Cristiano Ronaldo isn't your average bloke. The Real Madrid superstar hit that milestone on Thursday but he appears to be in better shape than ever before as he helps Carlo Ancelotti's side chase domestic and European success. He proved as much in a revealing photoshoot for his new CR7 underwear collection, showing off the muscular physique which has helped him net an astonishing 28 goals in 18 La Liga games so far this season. Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo poses in his new spring/summer range of CR7 underwear . The former Manchester United star, who turns 30 on Thursday, still looks in peak condition . Ronaldo watches Real Madrid beat Sevilla on Wednesday as he serves the final match of his two-game ban . The Portuguese, pictured celebrating against Celta Vigo last month, has scored 28 La Liga goals this season . Sportsmail's Pete Jenson highlights 30 of the key moments in Ronaldo's career so far. Ronaldo was forced to watch from the stands as Real beat Sevilla 2-1 at the Bernabeu on Wednesday night, completing a two-match ban for kicking out at Cordoba defender Edimar on January 24. The former Manchester United man, who also threw a punch at Jose Angel Crespo in the same game, was shown a red card during his side's victory, but he's now available for the trip to rivals Atletico Madrid this weekend. The Portuguese's new spring and summer range of underwear is the third he has released since launching his brand in 2013, although this time he has offered fans some handy hints on how to get a body just like his. Ronaldo's pearls of wisdom include tips on diet, exercise, sleep and relaxation, while he also reveals that he doesn't drink alcohol and opts for a steak with salad when eating out at restaurants. Ronaldo's new SS15 line is the third collection of premium underwear which originally launched back in 2013 . The 30-year-old was given a two-match ban for being sent off for this kick on Cordoba defender Edimar . Real star Ronaldo picked up his second consecutive Ballon d'Or award in Zurich, Switzerland, last month . Ronaldo nets one of his 28 La Liga goals with a successful penalty against rivals Barcelona in October . His dedication to becoming the best player on the planet has also led to him being named the Premier League's greatest ever player in a recent survey. Conducted by Usurv, the survey showed Ronaldo was the people's choice, finishing ahead of Thierry Henry and Ryan Giggs, who joined him on the fantasy podium. Ronaldo was brought to Old Trafford by Sir Alex Ferguson as a raw 18-year-old in 2003, and departed for Real Madrid in 2009 with three Premier League titles, a Champions League medal and an FA Cup, and as the reigning FIFA World Player of the Year. 1. Learn to train your mind as well as your body. Mental strength is just as important as physical strength and will help you achieve your goals. 2. Be disciplined. Keeping yourself motivated and sticking to your routine is key. For me, there is no room for easing off so I have to be strict. 3. Set yourself goals. It will help to keep you focused and work towards something. 4. Working with a training partner is a good way to add a bit of competitiveness and help push yourself. If you train with someone who is a similar level to you then you will help push each other. 5. Proper sleep is really important for getting the most out of training. I go to bed early and get up early, especially before matches. Sleep helps muscles recover which is really important. 6. Warming up properly prevents injury. In training we do a few laps of the pitch, stretching and cardio warm up exercises. Make sure you do something similar in your training, even if it is jogging to the gym or a warm up on the treadmill or bicycle. 7. Mix it up. I recommend a combination of cardio (running and rowing) and weight training to ensure that workouts target all areas of the body and increase both strength and stamina. It also helps to keep it interesting. 8. High intensity is important to get your blood pumping and to increase stamina. We do a lot of sprinting drills in training and they can be incorporated into your workout whether you are in the gym or outdoors. Try and add it to every workout you do. 9. Cardio sessions are also key for building up endurance and stamina, and to stay trim. Try to do periods of around 30 minutes, increasing the number of sessions as you get stronger. 10. Fit in exercise wherever you can. You can do an abs workout in your bedroom when you wake up in the morning or before you go to bed. If you get into a routine then it makes it easier as it will become a habit. 11. A good workout must be combined with a good diet. I eat a high protein diet, with lots of wholegrain carbs, fruit and vegetables and avoid sugary foods. I love fish, especially the Portuguese dish bacalhau à braz, and at restaurants I’ll order a steak with salad. 12. Make sure you stay hydrated. Drinking water is so important. I also avoid alcohol. 13. Eat regularly. If you train regularly it’s important to keep energy levels high to fuel your body for better performance. I sometimes eat up to six smaller meals a day to make sure I have enough energy to perform each session at top level. 14. I always make sure I have good music to listen to. It helps you zone out, get motivated and do your best. I like to listen to hip hop and reggaeton. 15. Relax. Training and physical sessions are most important, but living a relaxed lifestyle helps you to be the best you can be, physically and mentally. I spend my free time with family and friends, which keeps me relaxed and in a positive mind-set.","Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo turns 30 on Thursday, February 5 .

"The Konyaks are known for their fierce headhunting history, which continued until 1960. Found in large numbers in Nagaland, India, the former warriors are recognised by their facial tattoos and the animal skin, hair and horns which are ceremoniously draped over their bodies. Here, Aidan McGloin describes how he and photographer Jean-Christian Cottu travelled to the remote Mon district to get to know the people behind the tribal exterior. 'In ten or perhaps 15 years, most if not all of these former Konyak headhunters and their wives will be dead. Their faded tattoo-adorned faces will be buried beneath Christian headstones in hilltop villages in the remote Mon district of Nagaland in north east India. With their demise, the living memories of their unique cultural existence will disappear for eternity. These stunning photos, featured in the series Nagaland, were taken by photographer Jean-Christian Cottu, who travelled to the remote Mon district of Nagaland, north east India, to document the Konyak people. Many members of the tribe do not know their exact ages and do not have a birth certificate. Pictured here are Ginwang, 95, left, and Phongwang, 84, right . These elderly men and women have lived through a time when tribal warfare still resolved certain territorial conflicts. Their backs, torsos and facial tattoos bear witness to mortal combat and the customary headhunting. They were born into and inherited a strong tribal identity, which extended to the physical boundaries of their lands. They will die having intermittent access to limited aspects of modernity and having partially embraced a Baptist-based Christianity. Jean-Christian Cottu’s photographs provide a visual record of these people. These are not anonymous, stolen images, as is too often the case. Importance is rightly given to the names, ages, and villages of origin of these people. These images are by no means the only record of these former warriors and their families, but by taking a mobile photo studio, Jean-Christian wanted to go beyond the superficial cliché and instead capture the human dignity of these disappearing people. The elderly men and women were born into and inherited a strong tribal identity and also embrace a strong Baptist-based Christianity, something which started to change the way the tribe operated. Pictured here are Phamman, 78, left and Pulei, 95, right . The former warriors are differentiated from other Nagas by the tattoos which are drawn all over their faces. Other symbols of the Konyak warriors are big pierced ears made ​​of animal horns and war hats made of hunted wild pigs horns, hornbill feathers and wild bear or goat hair. Pictured here are Wangjin, 92, left and Manbang, 78, right . Each photograph is the result of a material exchange, in the form of a printed copy of their photograph or a monetary one, in the form of a few hundred rupees, and on occasions both. But the encounters were not merely restricted to nominal transactions. Our mutual curiosity was rewarded with undeniable human exchanges between us and some frank interviews. These elderly people have had a long, unscripted past. They are living through a challenging present and face a diminishing curtailed future. The Konyak warrior tribe is one of the many Naga tribes known for their fierce headhunting history and hunting skills and trophies won through hunting are worn as part of their costume, as shown above. Pictured here are Jaiyang, 90, left and Bawang, also said to be 90, right . The elderly men and women pictured by the photographer lived through a time when tribal warfare still resolved territorial conflict. They often wear a necklace with bronze faces, reflecting the number of heads they have cut. Pictured here are Gokpol, 88, left and Konwang, 76, right . These images and text attempt in a limited way to explain who the Konyak people we met are and to reveal a fraction of their respective stories. When . Jean-Christian asked me to accompany him on this project, I agreed to . give a hand with the lighting and translate, on condition that I would also interview the people that he intended to photograph. I wanted to complement his images with some words. So that those who would appreciate the beauty and poignancy of these photos might also have their curiosity rewarded with additional information about these unique people. By observing their interactions with Jean-Christian’s mobile photo studio and by interviewing the Konyak people I was hoping to discover something about their identity, their way of life and how the recent generations have coped with change. For the most part I relied on our guide Anyang to interpret my questions and their responses.' The Konyak tribes have traditionally had a strong warrior tradition and are mostly famous because they were still headhunting until the end of 1960. But there are now young members being born into the community, left, who will lead the tribe in a new direction.

"On paper, there is little doubt that Yaya Toure is Manchester City's most valuable player. Manuel Pellegrini may have a squad of stars, expensively assembled and with world class back-up in every position, but without their midfield general they are a different side. Since Toure left to join up with the Ivory Coast for the current Africa Cup of Nations, City have failed to win a single game. Yaya Toure celebrates after scoring a goal during the 2015 African Cup of Nations semi-final . Manchester City ace Toure (L) celebrates his goal with teammate Kouassi Gervais against DR Congo . While a draw away at Chelsea was viewed by some as a positive result, and certainly a positive performance, the other three games have been a disappointment. Defeat to Arsenal, their first at the Etihad since 2010, was followed by the dismal FA Cup exit at the hands of Middlesbrough. Throw in a draw with Everton, and the last month has been little short of a disaster. In fact, City haven't managed a Premier League win without his powerful midfielder since April of last year. His return cannot come quick enough. After Sunday's final, win or lose, City will be desperate to get their stars back to the Etihad, if possible ahead of a tricky mid-week trip to Stoke. Toure complains to referee Neant Alioum after a penalty is awarded to Equatorial Guinea on Wednesday . But, if they have been paying attention to his performances here in Equatorial Guinea, Pellegrini and his staff might have a few worries. Played as a holding midfielder, Toure has been a shadow of his usual self at this tournament. While at City he runs the show, driving past players, making tackles, scoring goals and providing assists, at the Cup of Nations he has practically been a bystander as his team-mates have carried him to the verge of a major trophy. Even a stunning strike against DR Congo couldn't mask another below-par performance. Toure has never hit the same heights for his country as in his illustrious club career, but even more than in previous tournaments, the midfielder has been off the pace. Ivory Coast's players celebrate with fans after winning their semi-final match with DR Congo . Being outshone in midfield on Wednesday night by Chancel Mbemba, the Anderlecht centre-half playing as a makeshift midfielder, was a low point. It is tempting to say that five games in just 15 days might have taken a lot out of him, but he has offered so little on the pitch that tiredness can only be part of the problem. Some onlookers have suggested that Toure is carrying an injury, which would be more bad news for Pellegrini. Certainly he is not moving comfortably, his movement restricted by more than just positional discipline. For long periods in Bata he was moving at little more than walking pace. After Serge Kanon scored the Ivory Coast's third goal in Bata, ten Ivorian players charged to the bench to celebrate. By the time they had finished, and returned to the pitch, Toure, had barely reached the edge of the penalty area, trudging back alone. Ivory Coast's defender Serge Wilfried Kanon celebrates his goal as Ivory Coast progress to the final . Kanon celebrates his goal with defender Eric Bailly in Bata on Wednesday . There is no doubt that the 31-year-old is still a leader. During the warm-up before Wednesday night's game he gave what looked like a rousing speech to his players. Anyone who saw it would laugh off the suggestion that he 'doesn't care' about playing for his country. But, more and more, his leadership seems to be coming through words, and not the all-action performances we know he can provide. Even off the pitch he has not been his usual self. Most teams here have put their captain forward to talk to the press before and after every game. Here, Yaya has spoken just once, before his country's opener against Guinea. Ivory Coast fans show their admiration for midfielder Toure against DR Congo in Bata . Aside from that he has shunned all interviews, merely walking past journalists saying 'there is no problem' after he had been replaced against Cameroon. It may be that City's star has been stung by criticism of his performances. Ivorian coach Herve Renard implied that his captain had been answering his critics with his fabulous goal that opened the scoring against DR Congo. But if Toure is trying his utmost to prove people wrong on the pitch by showing his best form, then the best he can manage is some way beneath the standard we have come to expect. Many reports suggest Toure is carrying an injury which will come as a blow for Manchester City . Manuel Pellegrini will be hoping the midfielder can rediscover the form that led City to the title last year . As he stormed past the waiting media again on Wednesday night, without so much as a word, it was clear for all to see - something is not right with Yaya Toure. Manuel Pellegrini must hope that, when he returns to Manchester next week, he can rediscover the form that led City to the title last year. Because if the Toure of the Cup of Nations returns, instead of the Toure of 2014, City can kiss their title aspirations goodbye. Pellegrini and Toure will be hoping to recreate their title celebrations again this season .","Manchester City have failed to win a game since he left for AFCON 2015 .

"It's game over for San Francisco's iconic Candlestick Park. Where once Willie Mays, Barry Bonds, Joe Montana and so many more created magic memories for the city's sports fans in spite of it's famously blustery winds, heavy machinery is now taking the stadium apart piece by piece. There is no room for sentiment for the demolition crew brought in after a successful public petition against more direct methods, such as dynamite and wrecking balls, extended the wait for the site's next incarnation as a $200million (£130m) urban outlet mall. The mall will open some time in 2017, but the rich history of where it will stand is undeniable. Not just a previous home for the NFL's San Francisco 49ers and briefly the Oakland Raiders, along with baseball's Giants after their move from New York, it hosted what would be The Beatles' last full live concert. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Incredible time-lapse of San Francisco 49ers new stadium build . Workers demolish a section of stadium seats inside Candlestick Park, San Francisco, once home to San Francisco's Giants and 49ers . The 'red zone' sign remains, for now, as The Stick is demolished in a process that is expected to take up to three months . The NFL's 49ers were the last professional franchise to call the park home having stayed there from 1971 to 2013 . Orange chairs - the ones not sold to collectors for $649 a pair - are ruthlessly ripped from the stands by diggers and the turf torn up in a process that is set to take up to three months to complete. Developer Lennar Urban, along with partner and mall-owner Macerich Corp, have plans in place for a 500,000-square-foot mall on a site that will also include 6,225 homes, 635,000 square feet of shops and 220 hotel rooms. Crew at the stadium wear orange but it's no homage to the Giants, just safety vests. The Loma Prieta earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter Scale on October 17, 1989, minutes before game three of the World Series was supposed to start, couldn't fell Candlestick Park. The stadium was credited with saving lives that day, with no one inside injured. But massive excavators are making short work of it. Unimaginative but lasting catch phrases are a lasting legacy of 'The Stick', named after its Candlestick Point location in the Bayview Heights area on the west shore of San Francisco Bay . It's home to 'The Catch', the 1982 heroics of Dwight Clark, who clutched Montana's match-winning touchdown pass against the Dallas Cowboys to lead the 49ers to their first Super Bowl. It was the first of eight NFC Championship games there. The seats that weren't sold to collectors for $649 a pair are ruthlessly ripped up during the demolition of Candlestick Park . An orange pile of chairs ready for recycling is crushed by machinery as the site is prepared for a $200m urban outlet mall . Candlestick Park was first opened in 1960 to be the home of San Francisco Giants baseball team after they moved from New York . Two more great plays are remembered as The Catch II and III - Terrell Owens' receipt of a Steve Young pass in the 1998 Wild Card round for a touchdown with eight seconds on the clock to beat the Green Bay Packers and Vernon Davis' grab from Alex Smith with nine seconds left for the win over the New Orleans Saints in the 2011 Divisional Playoffs. Originally opened in 1960, The Stick was built to be the home of Major League Baseball's San Francisco Giants and was the first 'modern' baseball stadium given it was built entirely from concrete. With then US vice president Richard Nixon throwing out the first pitch on opening day, it was home to two MLB All-Star Games in 1961 and 1984 and the 1962 and 1989 World Series. The stands are being torn down piece by piece after a community petition fought against the potential impact of dust from more direct methods . A worker wears the orange colour of the Giants but it's no homage to the team, just a high-visibility safety vest .

A United States flag flops on a pile of broken pallets and trash outside the stadium . Broken stadium seats are bound for recycling after being torn from the venue of The Beatles' final live concert . The tunnel that visiting NFL team's once entered the arena from is now framed by bald stands after the distinctive seats were removed . While sporting battles were won and lost at the venue, Candlestick Park has never looked as much like a war zone as this . The former playing field of Candlestick Park is also being ripped up as the foundations for the urban outlet mall and apartments are prepared . The Giants stayed until their move to Pacific Bell Park (now AT&T Park) in 2000, perhaps facing the also former New York-based side the  LA Dodgers  in the final baseball game there, leaving the 49ers as The Stick's sole occupants. The 49ers' time there stretched from 1971 to 2013, before they went to Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, with their final match there their 36th for Monday Night Football - the most of any ground. The 34–24 win over the Atlanta Falcons was dubbed The Pick At The Stick by pundits. It's not been confirmed whether there will be any remnants of The Stick once the development is complete, in the vein of Arsenal's former home at Highbury where the facade was retained at the front of apartments, but the memories will live on.

"It might resemble the giant exoskeleton as seen in the James Cameron film Avatar, but this terrifying-looking machine of the future is set to become a reality. A team of Canadian engineers and innovators are working on creating a giant human-controlled walking 'anti-robot' called Prosthesis, which is being built ‘by humans, for humans’. Its performance will be completely dependent on the person strapped into its vast cockpit of the massive metal exoskeleton, who will control it with their body. Scroll down for video . Human pilots will drive the 'anti-robot' exoskeleton using their entire bodies . The robot could become a reality as soon as 2015 if funds are raised. It is being built by a team of Canadian engineers and volunteers. The machine will be driven by a human 'pilot' using their limbs to control the metal exoskeleton. Prosthesis will measure 16 feet (5.4metres) tall and will weigh 7,500lbs (3,400kg). It is not designed to be a weapon or tool, but a sports machine. Its designers consider future pilots to be athletes. The machine will have a top speed of 19mph (30kmph). When it is built, the anti-robot will be a ‘hi-tech racing machine’ but piloting the machine will be difficult for the human inside it and there will be no automated controls. In effect the creation, which will stand 16ft tall, is like a hefty mechanical suit and has already began being built in a laboratory in Vancouver, Canada. The volunteers involved in the project said the machine will be the beginning of the ‘anti-robot revolution', will weigh a massive 7,500 lbs (3,400kg) and have a top speed of 19mph (30 kmph). Jonathan Tippett, the leader of the project, who has previously created a large robotic spider, said: ‘Prosthesis is neither a weapon, nor a tool. It is a sports machine, and the pilot is the athlete. It’s Formula One, meets the future.’ To operate the machine, a pilot will climb into the cockpit of the mechanical quadruped and will be strapped in, GizMag reported. Prosthesis the 'anti-robot' is being built 'by humans, for humans'. Its performance will be completely dependent on the person strapped into its vast cockpit of the massive metal exoskeleton (illustrated) The pilot will be able to operate the machine using their arms and legs so that they can become 'at one' with it, which is essential as they will not be able to see the exoskeleton’s feet. Mr Tippet said Prosthesis will ‘directly follow the movements of the pilots limbs’ so that their arms work the outside legs of the anti-robot and their legs control the machine’s inside legs. He said: ‘The machine will lope along like a gorilla’ and each huge leg has two joints to move backwards and forwards. Controlling all of the machine's leg joints requires the pilot to use their entire body and the force of each mechanical foot will be transmitted directly to the pilot’s arms and legs so they can ‘feel’ every step the machine makes. ‘Not violently or ever in a way that could hurt the pilot, but the pilot will know by feel, just exactly how much weight is on each foot at all times,’ Mr Tippet explained. The creation, (illustrated) which will stand 16ft fall, is like a hefty mechanical suit and has already began being built in a laboratory in Vancouver, Canada . Volunteers led by Jonathan Tippet (pictured right) have already built a 2:3 scale prototype of Prosthesis' walking leg, which they have called Alpha Leg, which uses a complex hydraulic system . Volunteers involved in the project have already built a 2:3 scale prototype walking leg called Alpha Leg, which uses a complex hydraulics system. Making the leg has enabled them to refine their plans for a lithium-ion power plant, control system and human control interface, as well as the hydraulics systems themselves. ‘Mastering the Alpha Leg will be the first step in training to become a Prosthesis pilot,’ they said. Prosthesis is an art research project designed to inspire the next generation of engineers and scientists and so far, over 65 engineering students have contributed to the project over the last three years. Prosthesis (illustrated) is an art research project designed to inspire the next generation of engineers and scientists and so far, over 65 engineering students have contributed to the project over the last three years . ‘We’ve poured hundreds - even thousands - of hours of our time into this project. We're here because we want to be, because we love what we're doing and we want to see our dreams brought to life,’ they wrote on a fundraising page. The band of volunteers are trying to raise 100,000 Canadian dollars on crowd funding site Indiegogo and are nearing the $30,000 mark. They claim to have solved ‘all the most challenging engineering problems’ and are keen to making their ambitious anti-robot plans a reality next year, when major backers could become pilots. The pilot will be able to operate the machine using their arms and legs so that they can 'become one with it,' which is essential as they will not be able to see the exoskeleton's 'feet'. The prototype's foot is pictured . The Prosthesis looks reminiscent of the AMPs (Amplified Mobility Platform) as seen in the James Cameron film Avatar . U.S. Scientists are working on next-generation combat wear for soldiers inspired by the nano suit worn in the Iron Man films and it could be used two or three years away. The Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit (Talos) would effectively give its wearer superpowers, such as the ability to see in the dark, super-human strength and a way of deflecting bullets, but its is a work in progress. The U.S. Special Operations Command (Ussocom) has called on scientists to develop a suit reminiscent of the one seen in the films that uses nanotechnology. Such a suit would probably build upon work done by an MIT professor who is developing 'liquid armour', which captured the imagination of U.S. armed forces scientists who are looking for a way of protecting their troops from intensive combat situations in Iraq and Afghanistan. At a conference in May, U.S. Navy Admiral Bill McRaven challenged scientists to build a suit that would function as a 'practical exoskeleton' and protect soldiers from shrapnel and bullets using Kevlar and nanotechnology. He said that the suit should be light enough for soldiers to wear in battle but also suitable for surveillance missions and the idea has captured people's imaginations.","The 16ft tall ‘anti-robot’ is called Prosthesis and is being built ‘by humans, for humans’ in Vancouver, Canada .

"Keshi Anderson has impressed Alan Pardew so much the 19-year-old has been fast-tracked into Crystal Palace’s squad for their trip to Leicester City. Anderson was earning £200 a month for non-League Barton Rovers only a week ago in the Southern League Division One — the football pyramid’s seventh tier. Anderson’s 19 goals this season for Barton won him a trial at Brentford last week and in a friendly against Palace the striker netted a perfect six-minute hat-trick. Keshi Anderson signed for Crystal Palace on deadline day from non-league side Barton Rovers . Manager Alan Pardew has been impressed by Anderson in the short time that he has been at Palace . Palace coaches saw enough to sign him for £30,000 on deadline day. He then netted on his Under 21s debut against Millwall. He was called to train with the seniors on Thursday and Pardew has included him in Saturday’s squad. ‘The headlights are still full on for him,’ Pardew said. ‘He was just a player who came to our attention really quickly. There was a bit of interest from other clubs. ‘It’s a similar route I took myself coming from non-League. He has sympathetic eyes from me from that point of view.’ Anderson would do well to learn from the mistakes of team-mate Wilfried Zaha, who made his loan to Palace permanent for £6million on deadline day to end a torrid two years at Manchester United. ‘Manchester United is a big environment for a young footballer to go into,’ Pardew said. ‘He’s going to have to raise his game. This isn’t the Championship where he was a star. This is a level up and he needs to be a star at this level.’","Keshi Anderson fired a six-minute hat-trick against Crystal Palace in a trial .

'People aren't seeing that from Jeb. I will say he's . been more active, been talking to folks, but not to a degree . that Chris Christie has been doing.' George H.W. and George W: Unlike his father and brother, who eagerly planned their run for the White House, Jeb Bush is still undecided about whether he will run for president in 2016 . Friends say Jeb Bush's cautiousness is due to his deliberate . manner and his experience watching his father and brother go . through what can be a meat-grinding process. They also say he is . not expecting to be drafted, recruited or convinced to run. That . is not his style. 'This is not a guy who spends sleepless nights staring at . the ceiling wondering if he should or should not run for . president,' said Ana Navarro, a Republican strategist and a . friend of Bush. 'He's a disciplined guy and will make this decision like he . does most other big decisions, through a serious deliberative . process weighing the pros and cons and looking deep into . himself. This is a decision that will be made by Jeb, his wife . and kids,' she said. If he runs, Bush would be injecting himself into the . presidential race in a Republican Party that has moved to the . right since he left the governor's office in 2006. More than likely: Jeb's son George P. Bush said it is more than likely that his father will run in the 2016 presidential election . Bush, whose wife of 40 years, Columba, was born in Mexico, . has a more welcoming view on immigration than many party . conservatives, who criticize his support for comprehensive . reform that would allow a path to legal status for undocumented . immigrants. If Bush were to win the Republican primary and become the . party's presidential nominee, he would have to convince a . majority of Americans that it would be worthwhile to have a . third president named Bush in the Oval Office. Worthwhile: If Bush were to win the Republican primary and become theparty's presidential nominee, he would have to convince amajority of Americans that it would be worthwhile to have athird president named Bush in the Oval Office . Traits: Jeb's uncertainty is concerning to some Republicans who say they aren't seeing traits of former Bush presidents in Jeb . Should he run, donors say Bush could get up to speed quickly . by tapping a ready network of financial supporters built from . his own alliances and from those who supported previous Bush . presidential bids. His father and brother have publicly urged him to run. People who know them say they are unsure of Jeb Bush's plans. 'Jeb is keeping very close counsel on what his future plans . are,' said Jim McGrath, spokesman for the elder Bush. 'I don't . think he's ready to make a decision. I think he's being very . sincere when he says he will wait until after the election to . decide.'","Unlike his father and brother, who eagerly planned their run for the White House, Jeb Bush is still undecided about whether he will run for president in 2016 .

"George Ford has warned Wales that he is not England's weak link as he steels himself for the onslaught he knows is coming at the Millennium Stadium. The rookie Bath fly half has the vision to unlock Wales when the RBS 6 Nations opens in Cardiff on Friday night, but his light frame means doubt persists over his defence despite solid outings against Samoa and Australia in the autumn. British and Irish Lions centre Jamie Roberts will be the main battering ram directed at Ford, but roaming wings George North and Alex Cuthbert, as well as the home back row, are sure to test his courage. England's fly half George Ford insists he's not the weak link ahead of the Six Nations opener with Wales . As the likely focal point for the Welsh power game, the 21-year-old Ford is ready to roll up his sleeves to halt the heavy traffic coming down his channel. 'I know what's coming. It happens in most matches you play as a 10 - you get targeted,' said Ford, who will be making only his third Test start. 'They look for you defensively and want you to make you tackles. It's something you expect and prepare for. The Bath player knows he'll be targeted by the Welsh but he's ready for the upcoming battle in Cardiff . Ford (centre) is known for having a brilliant rugby brain and has the vision needed to cause Wales problems . 'They want you to make as many tackles as possible to take other aspects of your game away, whether that's your attack, kicking game or game management. 'I like that part of the game - I like the responsibility of making my tackles because I want to contribute in defence as well as attack.' Ford has been among of the beneficiaries of 'Hymns and Arias' being played at full volume over the loudspeakers during training at the squad's Pennyhill Park base on Wednesday in preparation for the noise and passion that await at the Millennium Stadium. England have insisted on the roof not being closed, opting not to fall into line with the wishes of Wales in the hope of diluting the hostile atmosphere that will greet their attempt at making a triumphant start to the Six Nations. Jamie Roberts (left) and George North were identified as Wales' danger men ahead of Friday's clash . Only eight of the matchday 23 have played in the Welsh capital before and Ford, who shoulders the goalkicking duties on his first visit to Cardiff, is grateful for the meticulous preparation. 'It was good training with the speakers on. They were obviously very loud, but it was definitely something we needed to do because of the atmosphere and noise that will be there on Friday night,' he said. 'Communication will be massive so to practice under those conditions will definitely be worthwhile. I'm glad we did it. Ford impressed in his first two matches for England and knows he needs to exceed those levels in Cardiff . 'I'm excited about this game, about playing in front of a passionate Welsh crowd. I'll enjoy it and embrace it. We'll try to quieten them as much as we can. 'I haven't really thought about the goalkicking aspect. Either way, you've still got to kick and go through your pre-shot routine. 'You've still got to get the ball through the posts so whether it's loud or quiet, it shouldn't really affect you anyway. Northampton Saints Luther Burrell (left) will partner Ford in the centre after his impressive season . 'If it's like that you've got to get on with it. It doesn't really make it easier or harder if it's noisy anyway because you're in your own little bubble, concentrating on the kick.' Ford will be looking to unleash Bath team-mate Jonathan Joseph on Wales with England boldly opting for the in-form but inexperienced outside centre to partner Luther Burrell in midfield. 'Jonathan has been world-class in attack and his defence has been brilliant as well - he leads that at the club,' Ford said. Captain Chris Robshaw will be hoping to lift the Six Nations with England for the first time since 2011 . England's players train at Pennyhill Park ahead of their Six Nations opener against rivals Wales . 'Jonathan has that ability to create something out of nothing with an outside break or his off-loads with one hand. 'In attack he offers something different with his speed, agility and outside break. It is our job, at the right time, to get him into the right positions to show what he can do. 'There aren't many players around who can create things like that and to play with him is massively exciting. 'He always wants the ball in his hands in attack, but he is also good at the things people don't see, like his kick-chase and his communication about when to kick and so on.' Burrell (centre) charges through the England line during training at Pennyhill Park .

"Brad Guzan has hailed Thibaut Courtois as one of the world's best goalkeepers and insists the Belgium international deserves to be Chelsea's number one. The Aston Villa keeper believes Courtois is Chelsea's future ahead of Villa's trip to Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Courtois has replaced Petr Cech between the posts for the Blues this season after three years on loan at Atletico Madrid, where he won the Europa League, Super Cup, Copa del Rey and La Liga. Thibaut Courtois (L) is one of the top five keepers in the world, according to Brad Guzan . 'He's someone who I believe is one of the top five goalkeepers in the world,' Guzan told Villa's official site. 'Thibaut's resume is outstanding. His accolades for the past few seasons at Atletico speak for itself, with Belgium too. 'He's only 22 so these things are unbelievable. He's a top, top keeper and someone Chelsea sees their future with. 'There's nothing better that having the confidence of the manager and coaching staff. 'You want to be dependable and the guy the lads look to if an opposition player gets through the defence. Brad Guzan became No 1 at Aston Villa after eventually replacing Brad Friedel and Shay Given . 'You want them thinking that you're going to come up with the goods and make a save at the vital time. You want that responsibility. 'You relish that opportunity to be number one - be the guy that's going to hopefully help the team. That's what it's all about.' Guzan was back-up to Brad Friedel and Shay Given before eventually becoming first choice at Villa Park under Paul Lambert, and knows how Courtois would have felt after signing for Chelsea from Genk in 2011. 'It's a great feeling when you eventually establish yourself,' he said. Petr Cech warms up after being replaced by Courtois as No 1 at Stamford Bridge . 'It's not easy being a goalkeeper because you have strikers trying to take your head off - and it's different from outfield positions in that only one can play. 'You have to wait for your chance, or even your half-chance. You have to take it because you don't know when the next one is coming around. 'Thibaut has gone to Spain, not knowing the language and league, and gone on to achieve individual and team accolades.'","Chelsea face Aston Villa in Premier League clash on Saturday .

"It was one of the most dramatic cutbacks of George Osborne’s tenure in the Treasury. But when the Chancellor underwent his makeover in a smart London hair salon, he had ‘no idea’ how much of his mop would end up on the stylist’s floor. A new book reveals a powerful aide charged with improving Mr Osborne’s image did not tell him he was going to be sporting a mod-ish cut to widen his appeal to voters. When George Osborne ditched his floppy-haired look (right) in 2013, he had no idea how much of his hair would end up on the salon floor, according to a new book . Mr Osborne has insisted he was always prepared for unpopularity after taking charge of the nation’s dire finances in 2010. He was confronted with voters’ anger very publicly in 2012 when he was booed while handing out medals at the Paralympics in London. He later hired Thea Rogers, a former producer for BBC political editor Nick Robinson, to manage his image. She is credited with his repeated visits to building sites, inevitably wearing hi-vis, to portray a more business-minded politician outside the Westminster bubble. The hair cut was part of an image makeover, ordered by adviser Thea Rogers (left), which has also seen Mr Osborne jogging regularly and following the 5:2 diet to get in shape . But one of the most striking changes was unveiled at the Tory party conference in 2013, when his long, unruly style was replaced with the sharp, cropped look. Now an updated version of George Osborne: The Austerity Chancellor, by Janan Ganesh, reveals he was in the dark about his makeover, according to The Times. ‘Thea Rogers joined George Osborne last year as one of his advisers and set about sprucing up his image with a new half-mod, half-Caesar haircut,’ Mr Ganesh writes. ‘This involved some subterfuge: the chancellor had no idea how much hair was being lopped off his head as he sat for the stylist.’ At the time, Mr Osborne admitted that the new look was in part designed to disguise a bald spot. He joked that Michael Gove had told him: ‘You have applied your economic policy to your hairstyle. You have turned it around to stop the recession.’ Mr Osborne's aide Thea Rogers is also credited with creating his 'hard hat tour' of factories and building sites, often wearing hi-vis outfits . Aides say stories mocking the Chancellor's hi-vis visits are proof the makeover is 'cutting through' to voters . The new look got the seal of approval from his wife, Francis, but Mr Osborne has since sought to play down its importance, claiming in February this year that there are ‘more important things, dare I say it, for the country to be talking about’. However, privately aides at delighted at the shifting public perception of the Chancellor. The focus on Mr Osborne’s visits to building sites, factories and warehouses, always wearing fluorescent yellow and orange, have been mocked at times. But advisers say it is proof that the makeover is ‘cutting through’. In addition to the haircut, Mr Osborne also started following the 5:2 diet, which means he has to fast twice a week. Mr Balls has previously been a devotee of the weight-loss plan. The Chancellor has also been pictured sweating and exhausted running around St James’s Park, across the road from the Treasury. He also started wearing a Jawbone wristband to monitor his sleep patterns and track his fitness regime.","New book reveals he 'had no idea' how much of his hair would get the chop .

We will use that hurt to full effect. 'We have done our analysis and things and it was not easy to watch.

'There is always that buzz about Wales versus England and the history that goes with it,' Halfpenny added.

"Manchester United and Arsenal are likely to be the beneficiaries of the footballing meltdown of Jurgen Klopp’s Borussia Dortmund, with Mats, Hummels, Marco Reus and Ilkay Gundogan ever more likely to leave at the end of the season after the 2012 Champions League runners-up from slumped to the bottom of the Bundesliga. Wednesday night’s 1-0 defeat against Augsburg witnessed the extraordinary scenes of goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller climbing the perimeter fence to sympathise with angry fans after the home defeat left them three points from safety. Hummels, too, was pictured talking to fans through the metal grille of the fences and apologised to fans. Manchester United's hopes of signing Mats Hummels will be boosted if Dortmund are relegated . Real Madrid, Manchester United and Arsenal would be interested in Marco Reus if he was made available . Arsenal may step up their interest in Dortmund and Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan . The bottom of the Bundesliga as it stands . But with Bild Zeitung, Germany’s most powerful newspaper, now asking: ‘Is Klopp still the right man for Borussia Dortmund?’ it seems clear that the next few months will mark the end of the era for the team that so charmed Europe in 2011 and 2012 with its high-energy incisive football. Klopp himself has to show improvement by the Schalke derby match at the end of the month or face the sack, according to Bild: an extraordinary fate for a man touted as Arsene Wenger’s successor just a few months ago. Klopp’s team though also looks ready to be broken up as the strongest personalities, who made up its backbone in the run up  to the Champions League final, seem ready to leave. Reus’ departure in the summer is set and it was significant that the player received the worst possible mark from Bild of 6, indicating ‘awful’ for Wednesday night's display, with the comment that he was more of ‘liability than leader, more of a risk than a creative force’ and that he appeared to be ‘longing for Spain.’ Dortmund defender Hummels talks to supporters after defeat by Augsburg on Wednesday night . One fan voices his frustration at Hummels after Dortmund slumped to their 11th league defeat of the season . Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller also tried to placate angry supporters after final whistle .

Reus, who sustained an ankle ligament injury on the eve of the World Cup finals last year, has his heart set on a move to Barcelona, but their transfer ban means that he will no longer be able to move there in the summer. Real Madrid are likely to step into the breach as the club most likely to sign him. Bayern Munich have been the traditional destination of Dortmund players, Mario Gotze and Robert Lewandowski having taken that route in the past two seasons, but relations between the club are now so bad after Bayern's chief executive Karl Heinz Rummenigge publicly revealed that Reus has a £20million buy-out clause, that a deal there would be impossible. Manchester City and Manchester United’s only chance will be if Real decide not to pursue him. Arsenal and Chelsea would also bid – but Arsenal’s surplus of midfielders means they may not be willing to pay the kind of wages he will be offered elsewhere. Hummels of course has been Louis van Gaal’s No 1 choice of defender ever since he took the United job last summer and though the club was unable to buy him from Dortmund last summer, the fall-out from this calamitous season and Hummels’ own comments that he would consider his future at the end of the season mean that he is likely to end up at Old Trafford – though Dortmund will demand £30million. Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp was bewildered by his side's 11th defeat in 19 Bundesliga games . Dortmund's dejected players, trailed by coach Klopp, trudge off the field at the end of the match . Hummels is high up on Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal's transfer wish-list . Gundogan is a player who was highly-rated and desired across Europe two seasons ago – but who has since spent the best part of last season out with a back injury, which meant he missed out on last year’s World Cup triumph. Arsenal had him high up their list of targets prior to that injury and will sign a defensive midfielder in his role over the summer. The German, whose contract runs until 2016, has a buy-out clause of £16m. Arsenal are likely to look at other options first but if he can demonstrate some of the old form, he could yet end up at The Emirates. For now though all three star players and Klopp have a relegation battle with which they need to contend. Prior to the five-week winter break, almost all pundits were convinced that, bad though things were, there was no chance of Dortmund being relegated. After two games back, no goals and no wins, that certainty no longer holds. Bild ripped into Dortmund following their latest loss and suggested that Klopp has until the Revierderby with Schalke on February 28 to show there is 'light at the end of the relegation tunnel' otherwise his job is under threat. They add that the greatest example of how standards have fallen this season is star man Marco Reus, who 'displays a body language more like Bambi than Rambo.' They say his heart is already set on a Dortmund exit, most likely to Spain. Bild add that Ciro Immobile was a bad buy and doesn't fit into Klopp's system at all. Ruhr Nachrichten are scathing in their ratings, with Ilkay Gundogan, Kevin Grosskreutz, Reus and Immobile receiving a score of 5. In the German ratings system, 1 is regarded as 'excellent' and 6 as 'awful'. New signing Kevin Kampfl and defender Sokratis both receive 4.5, while the highest marks of 3.5 are given to Roman Weidenfeller, Never Subotic and Nuri Sahin.","Borussia Dortmund are currently bottom of the Bundesliga table .

He won’t be able to pass a ball after being given the runaround by those three. They will also energise and inspire Wayne Rooney, who is a striker with an incredible goalscoring record.

"Sharing capital: Nick Clegg hopes more businesses will adopt the John Lewis-style way of running to boost employee share ownership . Nick Clegg today outlined plans to boost employee share ownership and John Lewis-style businesses owned by staff. Under his plans employees can be given a new, universal 'Right to Request' shares in the company they work for. The Deputy Prime Minister is also setting up a commission to investigate the most effective forms of mutual ownership to give firms an off-the-peg guide to adopting employee shareholding. Mr Clegg will appoint an independent expert to advance the idea and will host a summit to promote the 'John Lewis economy' in the summer. He will say: 'Liberals believe strongly in the virtues of the market but only if it is a market for the many, not a market for the few. 'We don't believe our problem is too much capitalism. We think it's that too few people have capital. 'We need more individuals to have a real stake in their firms. More of a John Lewis economy, if you like.' 'The 80s was the decade of share ownership. I want this to be the decade of employee share ownership.' Staff at John Lewis stores own shares in the company which Mr Clegg says leads to lower absenteeism, staff turnover and production costs . At an event hosted by the City of . London Corporation and the Centre Forum think tank, he will say the . concept of employee ownership has been a 'touchstone' of liberal . thinking since the 19th century. 'And what many people don't realise about employee ownership is that it is a hugely underused tool in unlocking growth. Shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, said the plan followed Labour's lead on responsible capitalism . 'I don't value employee ownership . because I believe it is somehow 'nicer' - a more pleasant alternative to . the rest of the corporate world. Those are lazy stereotypes. 'Firms that have engaged employees, . who own a chunk of their company, are just as dynamic, just as savvy, as . their competitors. In fact, they often perform better. 'Lower absenteeism. Less staff turnover. Lower production costs. In general, higher productivity and higher wages. 'They weathered the economic downturn better than other companies.' Lib Dem Business Minister Ed Davey will be in charge of the drive within the Government to work out the barriers to employee ownership so that they can be removed. He will be looking specifically at the possibility of introducing a universal right for employees to request shares in the companies they work for. Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury, will be studying tax arrangements for employee-owned firms. Mr Clegg will host a summit on the issue later in the year. The John Lewis Partnership says it puts the 'happiness of partners at the centre of everything it does'. All of its 76,500 staff own shares in the 35 John Lewis stores, 272 Waitrose supermarkets, johnlewis.com, a production unit and a farm. Annually it has sales of over £8.2bn and staff 'share in the benefits and profits of a business that puts them first'. The company has a constitution and permanent staff co-own it - an idea that was laid down by founder John Spedan Lewis who set up the partnership in 1864. He signed away his personal ownership rights in what he described as an 'experiment in industrial democracy'. A source close to Mr Clegg said: 'Nick . wants to see real change in the way we do business, and firms that give . employees a real stake. 'He is pushing his government colleagues for real, early, radical action on this. 'Employee ownership is part of a long liberal tradition of economic reform - putting power in the hands of workers to build a more responsible capitalism.' Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said Mr Clegg was following Labour's lead on responsible capitalism. 'Ed Miliband has led calls for a more responsible capitalism and, despite having first scorned Labour's initiative, David Cameron now claims he has become a convert to the cause,' he said. 'The question for both him and Nick Clegg is whether they have the courage or the conviction to make the change that is needed. 'If Nick Clegg wishes to follow Labour's lead in promoting shareholder activism and engagement, that is welcome.' Clegg today said he would continue to push for a 'mansion tax' on high-value properties but admitted he is facing stiff resistance from within the coalition. He said that as a result of discussions with Conservatives, any progress on the tax would depend on 'give and take' negotiations. Clegg is pressing Chancellor George Osborne to use his March 21 Budget to target the rich with new taxes, in the hope of countering concerns that the Government's deficit-reduction programme is unfair on ordinary families. According to The Independent, as well as a tax on homes worth more than £2 million, Liberal Democrat ministers want the Chancellor to introduce measures to stop the rich avoiding stamp duty when they sell their properties. Answering questions after a speech in the City of London today, Mr Clegg said: 'Very, very high-value properties are taxed in exactly the same way at the moment as properties which are a fraction of their value - so a £10 million property at the moment is taxed in the same way as a £1 million property. 'It is quite right for us - and Liberal Democrats have done this for years - to say 'Well, hang on a moment, should we be trying to look at some way to make sure that these people who own these multimillion-pound properties pay their fair share?'. 'I stick to my guns that I think that is something we should do. 'But this is a coalition Government. We didn't win the election. I lead a party with 8% of MPs in Parliament. 'If the Liberal Democrats were in power, I think we would have moved on this much, much more quickly. 'I will continue to argue the case for this. I hope we will make some progress, but this is a process of give and take in a coalition Government.' Mr Clegg said it was a long-standing Liberal position, which he backed, to 'support taxes which capture unearned wealth and lower taxes on effort, enterprise, initiative and hard work'.",Clegg vows to keep pushing for 'mansion tax' on high-value properties .
"Pleasure in France is vice in England. The other week I made a documentary for French TV about Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh, for a series entitled Les Couples Mythiques du Cinéma. We are also covering Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. Had it been England, these programmes would have concerned adultery and immorality. This being a Continental audience, the subject was a great love affair, a grand passion. Dirty Bertie: Edward VII went to France to indulge his 'pleasure-hungry nature' Here, moral prejudices are aired, tongues wag and, as Stephen Clarke points out in this fine historical romp, in 19th-century dictionaries, ‘French’ was a synonym for ‘devil’ and ‘cad’. Sarah Bernhardt, for example, was a famous actress in France — in London she was branded ‘a woman of notorious, shameless character’. Queen Victoria set the tone. She loathed the ‘luxuriousness, extravagance and frivolity’ of the French, so it is no wonder that Edward, Prince of Wales, was tempted by life on the other side of the Channel. The regulations of his mother’s court, where the sole amusement was shooting at Balmoral and listening to bagpipes, bordered on lunacy. If you fancied a cigar, you had to surreptitiously lie in the fireplace and blow the smoke up the chimney. And any idea of sex before (or outside of) marriage was an abomination. As Victoria put it, ‘the sacred mysteries of creation’ could only be countenanced if they remained ‘shrouded in holy awe’. Edward fled to Paris for ‘boisterous fun’ at the earliest opportunity. Dressed in Highland costume — including a sporran, described in the French press as a ‘hairy bag’ — he attended trade exhibitions by day, examining telegraph machines, saxophones, electric clocks and modern gadgets that ‘sliced, crushed, harvested, heated, cooled or transported any industrial or agricultural products you could think of’. By night he enjoyed assignations  with ladies of ‘natural poise and delicate beauty’ in the tree-lined alleys of the Bois de Boulogne or in hotel suites — legs-in-the-air parties in ‘sumptuous private rooms with plush red sofas and walls swathed in velvet’. Where London life was puritanical and hypocritical, in Paris ‘there were flowers and plants everywhere, in vases along the walls and hanging from the ceilings like coloured chandeliers’. Edward was to decorate his own homes, Marlborough House and Sandringham, in French style, with Gobelins tapestries and ‘plenty of gilding on the woodwork’. Paris appealed ‘to Bertie’s pleasure-hungry nature’, but Victoria was predictably outraged . Paris appealed ‘to Bertie’s pleasure-hungry nature’, but Victoria was predictably outraged. In France, after all, men lolled on sofas with their hands in their pockets. Her solution was to get the Prince married off — to Alexandra, daughter of the King of Denmark, who is described ungallantly. ‘Her nose was too long and her forehead too low.’  The poor woman also had ‘the smallest head ever seen’ and to cap it all was stone deaf. In addition to these defects, she was obliged to turn a blind eye to her new husband’s myriad infidelities. Fortunately, Alexandra ‘seemed to have what it took to survive the humiliation’ — and her stoicism was even needed during the wedding, which was gloomier than a funeral. Exiled: Lillie Langtry - one of Edward's mistresses - was sent to a 'love nest' in Bournemouth . Victoria decreed that marriage was ‘a solemn holy act not to be classed with amusements’. In the official portraits, Edward wears a cloak, ‘the bulbously tasselled cord’ of which ‘hangs down over his crotch like an historic fertility symbol’. Though no oil painting — he was ‘very bald and chubby-faced’— Edward carried on womanising until obesity and bronchitis took their toll. We are told that the better to enjoy his ‘constant one-night stands and quickies,’ he invented an ingenious love-seat, a sort of saddle or bob-sleigh, with gynaecological stirrups attached. Less saucily — and ever fashion-conscious — he also introduced turn-ups on trousers to polite society, designed the first tuxedo and undid his lowest waistcoat button to accommodate a tummy that had swollen after many a 12-course dinner. To this day, a way of spotting a gentleman is to see if he has left his lowest waistcoat button undone, in homage to Edward VII. Turn-ups remain commonplace. My bet is that the love-seat has been inherited by his great-great-great-great-grandson Prince Harry. In France, Edward liked watching girls swirling on a carousel, with their ‘flying skirts and exposed calves’. Not only that, but because prostitution was legal in the Republique, the tarts were ‘under medical surveillance,’ and regularly checked for venereal diseases. Edward explored the bordellos of Montmartre and, having seen ‘the shadier world of street singers’, was inspired to chair a Royal Commission on the housing of the working class. LILLIE LANGTRY: MANNERS, MASKS AND MORALS by Laura Beatty (Vintage, ebook £5.99) A racy biography of Lillie Langtry, who rose form provincial origins to become Edward VII's mistress. Includes her letters to Arthur Jones, her childhood friend and secret lover. ‘Parisian poverty made him acutely conscious of the similar conditions that existed back home.’ Environmental health aside, however, back home carefree sex was compromised by rubber condoms ‘as thick as kitchen gloves’. Edward seemed to do without precautions and didn’t quite get away with each and every dalliance in England. When he gave his lover Harriet, Lady Mordaunt a pair of white carriage ponies as a token of his esteem, Sir Henry Mordaunt had the groom bring them to him and shot them dead on the front lawn. Living for the good times: Bertie died in 1910, his health ravaged by high living . Another mistress, Susan Vane-Tempest, was packed off to Ramsgate. Lillie Langtry was exiled to ‘a love nest in Bournemouth’ — which wasn’t exactly Biarritz. As he got older, Edward ventured forth to France for its health resorts rather than the brothels and salons. Biarritz was a favourite spot, as was the Cote d’Azur. ‘His less discreet mistresses complained that he stank of stale tobacco.’ He died in 1910, his health ravaged by high living. Alexandra sportingly allowed ‘big-busted’ Alice Keppel, one of his many beloveds (and Camilla Parker Bowles’s great-grandmother), to be present at the deathbed. Stephen Clarke maintains that Kaiser Wilhelm, Edward’s nephew, was so incensed at having to enter Westminster Hall by a side-door for the lying-in-state that four years  later the World War broke out.","Edward VII, son of Queen Victoria, went to France for some 'boisterous fun'

"Pub quiz question: Who were Mrs Grose, Mrs Pearce, Mrs Hudson, Mrs Danvers and Mrs Hughes? Answer: They were famous housekeepers. But you get an extra point if you also knew that none was married. In the arcane world of upstairs-downstairs protocol, Mrs was a courtesy title, implying respectability. Marriage for a housekeeper, because it would have been ‘a distraction from her service’, was actively frowned upon by employers, so they tended to be widows at best. By 1871, there were 140,836 housekeepers in Britain, stern-faced and meticulous women for whom nothing was too much trouble if it ‘added to the comfort’ of the gentry. They were sad creatures really: abstainers, early risers, methodical, punctual, discreet, implacable. A housekeeper was in charge of everything from the store cupboards to the linen closets, ‘a large bunch of keys clinking at the waist as they checked their housemaids’ work’. In service: Phyllis Logan as Mrs Hughes in Downton Abbey . She would busy herself repairing and replacing napkins, towels and dusters. She oversaw sewing and jam-making operations. When family members were due to arrive, she ensured there were ‘no dust sheets on the furniture, fresh flowers in all the vases, beds aired, linen crisply ironed and every fireplace scoured and gleaming’. It was the housekeeper’s duty to conceal the ‘frantic preparations behind the scenes’. She was, says Tessa Boase, ‘a senior management figure of absolute authority’. Or at least that has always been the supposition, and is how these female counterparts to butlers have been presented in films and fiction. The truth is more scandalous — this is one of those social history studies that uncovers such iniquities, the reader howls with rage. When Boase set out to discover the real human stories behind the green baize doors, the first thing she found was that allegedly beloved and valued housekeepers had no financial cushion, pension provision or job security. Slaving until they were racked with rheumatism on their deathbeds, throughout the 19th century they were lucky to be paid £35 a year (£1,500 today). To put this in perspective, the average aristocrat earned an annual £60,000 from his estates (£3.6 million today). Scandalous truth: Being a housekeeper wasn't as perfect as it appears to be in Downton Abbey . Furthermore, a housekeeper seldom emerged into the fresh air. They had to scurry along tunnels and passageways (designed so that female staff never glimpsed stable lads) and owing to these ‘troglodyte conditions’ often  had an anaemic appearance and vitamin D deficiency. There was no sick pay, of course. A housekeeper had to be supplicatory, bowing and scraping. ‘She was entirely at the mercy of her mistress’s good humour,’ says Boase, and many of those old trouts could be ‘prey to capricious mood changes and querulous demands’. They would order, cancel and re-arrange lunch parties for 100 guests,  heedless of the practicalities or disruption. When Mrs Penketh, housekeeper at Erdigg in North Wales, got into an understandable muddle with the grocery budget owing to her mistress’s extravagance, she was accused of embezzlement, put in prison and ended her days in Salford Workhouse. Diana Rigg as Mrs Danvers in Rebecca . If Grace Higgens, Vanessa Bell’s housekeeper at Charleston, ever had the cheek to risk a day off, she’d come back to find the sink full of dirty dishes ‘or the fridge full of rotting meat’. She wasn’t allowed feelings or a life of her own. Boase’s most outrageous case, however, concerns Mrs Doar, of Trentham Hall, one of the many seats of the Marquis of Stafford. Despite 14 years’ devoted service, she was sacked for expecting a baby. ‘It would be a bad example to others, and a Housekeeper who has Maids to look after should not be bearing children even to their husbands,’ thundered Lady Stafford.  Mrs Doar, uniquely, was married — though Mr Doar had to live separately in Stoke-on-Trent. The fact of the matter was that a pregnant servant had no rights. ‘Servants were not supposed to have children,’ says Boase. ‘No matter what the circumstances — betrothed, seduced, raped — getting pregnant was grounds for immediate dismissal without a reference.’ Two-thirds of the abandoned babies at London’s Foundling Hospital came from women in service. ‘Another way out was infanticide.’ (The late Queen Mother found an ingenious solution to the problem: at Clarence House she mostly hired gay men.) Even though Trentham Hall was empty for all but six weeks of the year, ‘it is quite impossible in such an establishment to permit her breeding’, Lady Stafford continued, outraged at Mrs Doar’s presumption. The housekeeper was given her marching orders. But first her bags were opened for inspection. They were found to contain ‘quantities of tea, sugar, coffee, foreign wine, soap, candles and mops’ — so in addition to being with child, the terrified woman was accused of pilfering. ‘It is dreadful to contemplate such depravity in one who had every confidence placed in her,’ gasped her erstwhile employer melodramatically, no doubt thinking what an incursion had been made into the Marquis’s £200,000 annual income by those mops. Una Stubbs as Mrs Hudson in Sherlock . If I’d been Mrs Doar, I’d have burned the bloody house down. Boase failed to find out what happened next, but suspects the workhouse — from where Mrs Doar’s child would have been taken, and she herself would have ended her days ‘eating gruel’. One good thing about two World Wars, the reader will concede, is that country house life was much retrenched by hostilities and the servants set free. Wrest Park in Bedfordshire, for instance, changed its use ‘from indulgent weekend chateau to war hospital’. The housekeeper, Mrs Mackenzie, organised the conversion of the salons into wards. Fine furniture and oil paintings were removed to the cellars. B eside the rococo marble fireplaces and beneath gilded ceilings, doctors amputated gangrenous limbs — the housekeeper attending as a nurse. One thing didn’t change: wounded officers could use the front door, but other ranks limped in through the servants’ quarters. Of the housekeepers remaining in 2014, one is Ms Nicky Garner at Holkham Hall. ‘I’m up close and personal with Lady Coke’s clothes, her shoes, her children,’ she says. ‘I’m part of an extended family.’ Nicky is ‘waging war on the moth infestation’, and feeds her ladyship’s parrot, Basil. Even in the 21st century, however, Nicky is aware that she’ll be ticked off if she is over-familiar. Nicky may be Nicky to all, but Lord and Lady Coke are always Lord and Lady Coke, except I imagine to each other. ‘It’s a humble position; there is a lot of yes sir, no sir,’ admits the thoroughly modern housekeeper. I do hope the excellent Ms Garner garners more than £35 a year.","The housekeeper is thought of as a figure of absolute authority .

"A father whose life was saved by a heart transplanted from a keen cyclist awoke to find he had a passion for the sport too. Kevin Mashford, 38, was given weeks to live as he battled a congenital heart condition. The businessman did not realise how serious his illness was until medics told him he had kidney failure, lung failure and heart failure. Scroll down for video . Kevin Mashford, 38, developed a new passion for cycling after a life-saving heart transplant from a man called John - an avid cyclist who had died in a collision with a car while out riding . After waking up from the transplant operation Mr Mashford begged physiotherapists to bring an exercise bike into his room, and cycled for seven minutes a day. Despite never having cycled before, he took to the saddle when he left hospital, and now regularly cycles, with John's name etched into his helmet . However, after his successful operation, doctors told Mr Mashford his new heart came from a man named John – an avid cyclist who was killed in a collision with a car while out riding. Seven days after his 13-hour operation he asked physiotherapists to bring an exercise bike into his room and cycled seven minutes every day for a week. And, despite never having cycled before, he took to the saddle as soon as he left hospital and is now regularly clocking up the miles – with John’s name etched inside his helmet. He is also gearing up for a challenging 342-mile ride from his home near Bristol to Newcastle – where he had the life-saving transplant – to raise money in John’s memory. Mr Mashford was born with multiple heart defects, meaning his heart was not effectively pumping blood around his body. He was fitted with three pacemakers (one of which is pictured in an X-ray before his heart transplant) but suffered a stroke and nearly died . In January last year Mr Mashford's condition deteriorated and he was put on the list for a heart transplant. He had the operation and says when he woke up and was told his heart was from a cyclist he immediately felt 'stronger'. He completed a 30 mile charity cycle ride in John's memory 19 weeks later . Mr Mashford – whose wife Jo, 38, is expecting their third child – said: ‘Before my transplant I had never really cycled. But when I found out that my donor had died in a cycling accident I was determined to do it in his memory. ‘I have “RIP John” written in my cycling helmet so he’s with me whenever I’m on the bike. I only know his first name, John, and when I’m tired I ask him for a bit extra and it spurs me on.’ Mr Mashford – who has two sons Liam, six, and Josh, nine – had a congenital heart condition and has had a number of major operations since his diagnosis. He has had three pacemakers fitted, suffered a stroke and was read his last rites at one point. However, he went on to recover and lived as normal a life as possible and even set up his own design and project management business. After his heart transplant (he is pictured in hospital after the procedure) Mr Mashford now wants to encourage people to sign on to the organ donor list. 'At some point my donor had made a conscious effort to sign up to the organ register and as a result I am able to keep enjoying my life as well as bring a new one' he said . Mr Mashford, father to sons Josh, nine (left) and Liam, six (right) says he owes everything to his heart donor, John. He said: 'Thanks to him signing on the organ donor list I have a new life, a really active life. I have a sense of responsibility to my donor and his family and I'm never going to waste it' But his condition deteriorated and in January last year he was admitted to the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle, and placed on the donor register where he awaited a new heart. The surgery took place in May last year. The hospital is an internationally recognised transplant centre. He claimed that as soon as he was told about John he knew everything was going to be fine. He said: ‘I was keen to find out a bit about my donor. The moment I woke up I felt stronger. I asked my physio to bring in an exercise bike and I cycled seven minutes a day for the next seven days in memory of my donor. My heart wanted to go and go. ‘Nineteen weeks later I completed a 30-mile charity cycle in his memory. A year later I rode 54 miles from London to Brighton.’ Mr Mashford, from Backwell, North Somerset, said he owes everything to John. He added: ‘I realised another family have done this for me – another family have enabled my family to carry on.’ On why he had taken up cycling, he said: ‘Some people talk about how muscle memory can survive a transplant but I don’t know about that. I put it down to the fact that I wanted to do something in John’s memory and, because he was keen on cycling, I chose that.’ Mr Mashford’s wife Jo said: ‘Kevin’s transplant has had an unbelievable change. We feel like we have been given a second chance at life.’ To sponsor Mr Mashford visit his website:www.team-mash.co.uk .","Kevin Mashford, 38, was born with multiple rare defects of the heart .

"The pressures of modern relationships means more and more couples are in committed relationships but don't share a home, new research has revealed today. One in ten adults in Britain are in a relationship but not living with their partner – a phenomenon known as 'Living Apart Together' (LAT) - and most of those are incorrectly counted as single in official statistics. The study, by Birkbeck, University of London, the University of Bradford and NatCen Social Research, encompassed the nine per cent of British adults who, although they are in a steady relationship, do not live with their partner. Shared solitude: Although younger couples are more likely to be LATs, there are a surprising number of older couples who live apart . There is a common assumption that people who choose not to live with their partner are either wealthy celebrity couples – such as Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Burton – or are professional couples forced to live apart because of their jobs, say the authors. In fact, LATs come from all sections of British society and from all parts of the country, and only eight per cent live apart primarily because of where their jobs are, according to the study. Director Tim Burton and actress Helena Bonham Carter famously live apart . Professor Sasha Roseneil, from Birkbeck’s Department of Psychosocial Studies, said: 'Nowadays very few people settle into a life-long relationship in their early twenties and stay with their partner “until death us do part”. 'People have complex relationship histories, and they often carry with them the emotional legacies of divorce and separation. 'For some people, more or less consciously, living apart together is a way of dealing with the messiness of intimate life today, protecting themselves, their children and their homes from some of the distress that they have previously experienced when a cohabiting relationship breaks down. 'That said, most people in LAT relationships have a strong sense that they are a couple, and many are in long-term relationships to which they are deeply committed.' Although the majority of LATs are under 35, 11 per cent are 55 or over. Around two-thirds of LATs live within 10 miles of each other and the vast majority (86 per cent) are in daily contact. The researchers found that around a . third of LATs live apart because they feel they are not yet ready to . live together, although many hope to do so in the future. A further third . choose to live apart – however, few of these see this as a lifestyle . choice, rather living apart is seen as emotionally safer, or a better . way to manage other commitments, such as those to children, family and friends, or work. One . woman surveyed called Carrie said: 'I don’t want to rush into it . because my son suffers from ADHD, and he doesn’t deal with change very . well. I just want to take it, each day at a time. 'I’m not saying it [cohabitation] will never happen. 'I do hope it does happen.' While being in the early stages of a relationship is a major reason for living apart, nearly as many couples simply prefer the arrangement . The remaining third are not able to live together due to circumstances outside the relationship itself – including financial reasons or working or studying in different places. Another participant called Emma said: 'We’re like a little team and when we’ve got decisions to make we’ll make them together. 'And if I’m having a good day I think, “oh I’ll ring him and tell him”, if I’m having a bad day then I’ll ring him and sob down the phone.' Only a tiny minority of couples - just one per cent – say the main reason they live apart is to maintain benefit entitlements. Choice: While work, children from previous relationships and other factors may force a couple not to live together, some just like the freedom it offers them . One respondee, called Andrew, was brutally honest, saying: 'As a bloke... it's quite a good situation, because I can do what I want... And have the best of both worlds.' Although the study shows that couples who live apart are a sizeable minority, they are currently ignored by the Census and most other social surveys on which the design of public services are based. Professor Roseneil added: 'We would like to see LAT couples have the right to ""opt in"" to legal recognition – for protection in case of separation or bereavement – and to be taken into account by those providing personal, health and social care services, such as relationship counselling and family support.'","A large percentage of couples are 'Living Apart Together'
Complexities of modern relationships is one reason behind trend .
Some have work constraints but many are LATs as a lifestyle choice ."
"Cringe: After singer Tom Odell was given a big fat zero in a review in  NME, his father rang the music magazine's offices to complain . Whether it's enthusiastically enjoying air guitar to Dire Straits at a family wedding, or telling your friends humiliating stories, everyone knows what it's like to be embarrassed by their father. However, when you're a Brit Award-winning singer on the cusp of super-stardom, it's probably a bit more cringe-worthy. So pity poor musician Tom Odell, whose father rang up the offices of music magazine NME to blast its writers for giving his son a rare 0 out of 10 for his album Long Way Down. NME reviewer Mark Beaumont unleashed his full critical fury, describing the 22-year-old singer from Chichester as a 'poor, misguided wannabe who's fallen into the hands of the music industry equivalent of Hungarian sex traffickers'. He added: 'I wish I could say there's a place in Hell reserved for Tom Odell. There's not. Just loads more Brits. 'He'll be all over 2013 like a virulent dose of musical syphilis, pounding and warbling away at every papal election and Bradley Wiggins finishing line.' The magazine puts the boot in even further, justifying the zero grade by saying you 'can't unhear' the music, reports The Independent. Lucy Jones, the deputy editor of the . magazine's website, posted a message on Twitter saying that her . staff had taken an angry phone call from the elder Mr Odell after the issue hit newsstands. NME deputy editor Lucy Jones lets the world know of the elder Mr Odell's unhappiness with his son's critical mauling . Some indignant music fans took to Twitter to voice their anger at Mr Beaumont's scathing review of privately-educated Odell, famous for songs like 'Another Love' and 'Hold Me', as a publicity stunt. Music critic Simon Price tweeted: 'Shameless showboating by NME, giving awful Tom Odell 0/10. Give your core indie acts more sub-5/10 marks and we'll believe you've got b****.' He also claimed NME was unwilling to . unfavourably review bands its readers enjoy, such as Beady Eye, fronted . by former Oasis singer Liam Gallagher. In the latest edition of NME (pictured) reviewer Mark Beaumont said: 'I wish I could say there's a place in Hell reserved for Tom Odell (right). There's not. Just loads more Brits' 'In case anyone missed that, the NME that gave Tom Odell 0/10 is the same NME that gave Beady Eye 7/10. ""Which"", ""side"", ""bread"", ""buttered"",' he added. Mr Beaumont defended the review, tweeting: 'It's an honest reaction to a record that cynically combines everything dull and despicable about mainstream music.' Tom Odell's agent Frazer Lawton refused to comment. A spokesman for NME did not respond to requests for comment.

"ADRIAN DURHAM: The World Cup is by far the biggest stage of all, it’s Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard’s last chance to shine . ADRIAN DURHAM: Jack Colback is the most underrated player in the Premier League... Sunderland fans should thank him and move on . ADRIAN DURHAM: England must be adventurous and take the World Cup by storm or go out in glory... my starting XI for the opener with Italy . Is Roy Hodgson morphing into Fabio Capello? I sincerely hope not. Two months ago I interviewed Roy, he was charming and knowledgeable and keen to listen to the views of me and other passionate England fans. The consensus then was that none of us expected England to win the World Cup, but we would be happy to see us play with adventure. Roy promised us he would be taking risks and not holding his players back: 'We will be brave and we will believe in ourselves and we will risk defeat. 'We won’t try and sneak our way through the games. With the type of players we’ve got that wouldn’t suit us.' Passing it on? Hodgson will hope for a better World Cup than Capello (right) endured in South Africa in 2010 . Steady: Hodgson is more than capable of playing it safe, as shown by England's draw in Ukraine last year . He even talked about the Liverpool way. Well, for me, the Liverpool way means blowing teams away early on and putting on a show; and to do that you need exciting, dynamic, imaginative players. The only two in the England squad who are available for the Italy game who have shown those qualities recently are Ross Barkley and Raheem Sterling. Be true to your word Roy – be brave, as you promised me you would be two months ago. Don’t just go with Lallana, put Barkley and Sterling in there as well, blow the Italians away early on. If you go for it, if you show adventure and take risks, you will be forgiven if it goes wrong. The future: The talented Ross Barkley (left) must be allowed to shine in South America . If you’re cautious and fail – you will be judged a failure. We had to endure the pain of a gutless manager four years ago. Fabio Capello didn’t know his tactics, and he didn’t know his team. Even worse, he lost control of his players mid-tournament. An astonishing display of terrible mismanagement, and he’s lucky to get a chance to show he can do it with Russia at this World Cup. The England fans all know Sterling and Barkley should be in the team, and I suspect the England players know it too. Wing wizard: Raheem Sterling must have a big part to play for England at the World Cup . But does Roy Hodgson know it? I hope so, because if he tries to 'keep it tight' against Italy, and go for a draw because 'a draw is a good result', I suspect England will suffer. We have flaws at the back that decent sides can and will exploit. The two recent friendlies prove my point: against Ecuador we played with adventure and it was great to watch. Against Honduras we were one-dimensional and functional. We drew both, but which gave England fans more satisfaction? The first of course. If we are poor to watch, and go out in the group stage, Hodgson will prove himself to be a poor man’s Capello, a label that should strike fear into the England manager’s heart. Be brave Roy. Deliver on your promise. Roy's Lions: Hodgson has depth in his squad, and England must be bold in Brazil .","Roy Hodgson promised he would play with adventure at the World Cup .

"Sunderland have hit out at Jack Colback after the 24-year-old moved to rivals Newcastle United on a free transfer. The Wearside club are angered that a player they have trained since the age of eight has walked out of the club, and particularly upset that he has joined their neighbours. Colback chose to sign for his boyhood club Newcastle over Aston Villa and West Ham, who were also interested in his signature. Happy days: New signing Colback holds a Newcastle scarf and poses for photographs pitch side . Controversial: Colback crossed the North East to sign for his boyhood club Newcastle in June . Montage: Sunderland tweeted this picture of Colback scoring and celebrating against Newcastle . Bitter taste: Sunderland are angry at the departure of a player they have nurtured for 16 years . Pointing the way: Colback says he enjoyed his time at Sunderland but couldn't pass up the opportunity . In a statement the club claimed to have offered the midfielder everything he had asked for, and said that the transfer 'left a bitter taste'. ‘Jack is a player we have nurtured and developed through our academy system since he was eight years old,' the statement read. 'We gave him the opportunity to become a professional footballer and are therefore extremely disappointed in the events that have led to his departure from the club. ‘This wasn’t about money - the club agreed to all of the terms demanded of us during discussions and we were always led to believe that Jack wanted to stay with us. 'At his and his representatives’ request, . final talks were put on hold until the club secured its top flight . status. To our dismay however, we were subsequently never given the . chance to negotiate with him to stay. That will go down well: Colback celebrates Sunderland's victories over Newcastle . 2008-2014: SUNDERLAND: 115 apps / 4 goals . 2009-2010: IPSWICH (loan): 37 apps  / 4 goals . 2010-2011: IPSWICH (loan): 13 apps / 0 goals . ‘For him to then leave the club that has supported him throughout his formative years in such a manner, with no chance for Sunderland to recover any of the significant investment that it has made in him as a player, has left a bitter taste.' The club also posted a picture of Colback celebrating against his new club on their Twitter page. Colback, however, appears to see the split differently, claiming he leaves Sunderland with positive emotions towards the club. He said: ‘I’m absolutely delighted. To come to the team I supported as a boy, my hometown team, will be really special for me. ‘It was an . opportunity I couldn’t let slip. If you asked fans around the world the . one thing they’d like to do before they die, it would be to play for the . team they support and I’ve got the chance to do that. ‘I’ve . only got good things to say about Sunderland, they gave me my chance . and I want to thank the fans and the club for all their support. I hope . they can understand the chance I’ve had here to move to my boyhood . club. 'Now I can’t wait to pull on the black and white shirt at St. James’ Park for the first time.’ Switching sides: Colback is sure to be booed when he faces Sunderland next season for Newcastle . Colback accepts that he will get stick from Sunderland fans, but says it is all part of being a professional. 'I'm sure I will be hated quite a lot there now and the derby at the Stadium of Light should be interesting,' he told The Sun. 'But it is not something I can dwell on and I am strong enough to deal with it. 'This is football and I couldn't allow myself to think about what fans were going to say and then miss this chance.'","Club statement attacks midfielder and his representatives .

ADRIAN DURHAM: England must be adventurous and take the World Cup by storm or go out in glory... my starting XI for the opener with Italy . Playing football on the light, golden sand of the Copacabana in 30 degrees of burning sunshine is a good, good feeling. And as I made my way off the beach back to my apartment, the reality of what is about to start sunk in. A sweaty drive through the heavy traffic takes you to the Maracana, where the World Cup final will be staged next month. This is where legends and heroes will be created in the next few weeks. It’s not just the final that makes the player’s name, although that is the ultimate moment to do be either hero – ask Sir Geoff Hurst; villain – Roberto Baggio knows that feeling; or both – ladies and gentlemen, I give you Zinedine Zidane, the only man to win and lose different World Cup finals single-handedly. Club success is brilliant, but when it comes to being remembered, it’s history made on a micro level. Biggest stage: Rooney and Gerrard in training for England... and this could be their last chance to shine . Next step: Can they elevate themselves from great club players, to true star status? To hit the globe hard enough to stay in people’s consciousness you have to do it at the World Cup. Nowhere else can give you that level of legendary status. What do most people think of when they hear the name Diego Maradona? Hand of God of course. Johan Cruyff? The Cruyff Turn. Bobby Moore? That tackle on Pele in 1970. Gordon Banks? That save from Pele in 1970. Marco Tardelli? The best celebration ever. Michael Owen? That phenomenal goal in 1998 in St Etienne. The list goes on and on. World famous: England winning the World Cup in 1966, Geoff Hurst and the Three Lions' defining moment . Hero and villain: Zidane scored twice in the 1998 final, but was sent off for a headbutt in 2006 in against Italy . It’s all about the World Cup. Liverpool fans will remember Suarez’s 31 goals for them this season, but the rest of the world knows Suarez as the villain against Ghana in Johannesburg in 2010. Andres Iniesta’s most memorable feat is scoring the winning goal in a World Cup final, not being part of the great Barcelona team that included Messi and Xavi. So all 736 players converging on Brazil this week for the World Cup know that this is the chance to make an indelible mark on football history. Aside: Suarez (front) scored 31 goals for Liverpool last season... but most will remember him for something else . Cheat? Suarez handball in 2010 prevented a goal, before Ghana missed the resulting penalty . And that includes the England squad. This is the moment where they can do something that means they will be remembered forever. For Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard, it’s a last chance probably. Can any of them take it? Can they elevate themselves from great club players, to true star status at a World Cup? Can they create history and earn themselves a chapter in the book of World Cup history? Will they seize the moment to earn the right to be mentioned in the same breath as Pele? There are some fans, especially in England, who will tell you international football is dying. Utter garbage. A true test: Johan Cruyff performed on the biggest stage, not just at club level . The biggest stage: Maradona's 'Hand of God' against England in the 1986 World Cup . Despite FIFA’s spectacularly terrible way of running the game, the World Cup remains the biggest sporting event on the planet, bigger even than the Olympics. Whether England are good or bad, when they get to a tournament they are always bigger than any club side around. Brazil is a place for legends – let’s see if Roy Hodgson and these England players can make themselves true legends, not just club legends. Roy's Lions: Brazil is a place for legends - let's see if Roy Hodgson's men can make their own history .","Can Rooney and Gerrard step up on what could be their last chance on the biggest stage?

"White people who kill black people in 'Stand Your Ground' states are 354 per cent more likely to be found justified in their killing than a white person who kills another white person, according to research. On Saturday George Zimmerman, 29, was acquitted of . second-degree murder and manslaughter in the shooting death of 17-year . old-Trayvon Benjamin Martin. But he was not arrested for 44 days after the February 26, 2012, shooting as police in Sanford insisted that Florida's Stand Your Ground law on self-defence prohibited them from bringing charges - Florida gives people wide latitude to use deadly force if they fear death or bodily harm. Scroll down for video . On Saturday George Zimmerman, 29, was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the shooting death of 17 year old Trayvon Benjamin Martin . The result was drawn from a study using FBI data conducted by John Roman, a senior analyst at Urban Institute’s Justice Policy Center. He examined racial disparity using data on 43,500 homicides from 2005 to 2009 - the most recent years for which data was available, reported PBS. He narrowed the sample to about 5,000 homicides by only analysing killings in which there was a single shooter and a single victim, both of whom were strangers to each other. Breakdown of the killings: The figures represent the percentage likelihood that the deaths will be found justifiable compared to white-on-white killings . Roman looked specifically at 'justified' homicides - defined as the killing of a felon during the commission of a felony, committed by private citizens. He discovered that killings of black people by whites were more likely to be considered justified than the killings of white people by blacks. Frontline then asked him to analyse the data and look for findings between states which had Stand Your Ground versus those without the laws. Under the Stand Your Ground law, which . was approved in 2005 and applies in over 30 states, people fearing for their lives can use deadly force without . having to retreat from a confrontation, even when it is possible. The self-defence law applies in Florida where Zimmerman shot Trayvon Martin dead. The court was told that he had followed the unarmed youngster through a park because he looked like he was 'up to no good.' But Zimmerman, . a volunteer neighbourhood watchman, claimed he shot Martin in . self-defence, and that the teen punched him repeatedly before deciding . to use lethal force. The statute is central to Zimmerman's defense in a case that captivated the United States throughout much of 2012 because police initially declined to arrest Zimmerman based on his self-defense argument and right to use deadly force under Florida law. Roman analysed the pool of 43,500 homicides by race in states with Stand Your Ground laws and those without them. He found that whites who kill blacks in non-Stand Your Ground states are 250 percent more likely to be found justified in killing a black . person than a white person who kills another white person. But in Stand Your . Ground states, that number jumps to 354 percent. Footage: CCTV footage shows Trayvon buying Skittles and a soda at a 7/11 . Evidence: A shirt worn by Zimmerman on the night of the shooting was used as evidence in the trial . Injuries: Photos of cuts to the back of Zimmerman's head and his face were included in the evidence . Fatal mark: A bullet hole can be seen in the front of the hooded top Trayvon was wearing on the night he died . Crime scene: Trayvon was shot outside with Florida complex . But the findings are not yet conclusive - the . data doesn’t show the circumstances behind the killings, for example . whether the people who were shot were involved in home invasions or in a . confrontation on the street. Plus . there are less white-on-black shootings in the FBI data  -only 25 total . in both the Stand Your Ground and non-Stand Your Ground states. Additionally Stand Your Ground laws can be applied at multiple points during an investigation. Zimmerman . was not arrested for over a month following the shooting as police in . Sanford insisted that Florida's Stand Your Ground law on self-defence . prohibited them from bringing charges. A special prosecutor later brought the murder charge. The prosecutor accused Zimmerman of profiling Martin and chasing him vigilante-style rather than waiting for police to arrive. Zimmerman . left the courthouse as a free man, although the NAACP has called for . the Justice Department to open a civil rights case against Zimmerman. Though . the department has a history of using federal civil rights law in an . effort to convict defendants who've previously been acquitted in state . cases, it's not always easy. Forceful: Thousands of protestors gathered in Times Square on Sunday night to demonstrate against the acquittal of George Zimmerman in Florida late Saturday. The march continued up 5th Avenue toward Harlem when arrests began . Massive: The crowd of pro-Trayvon Martin protestors swelled in Times Square, where they marched from Union Square on Sunday before continuing uptown . Blocked: With emotions high and traffic stopped, tensions rose as protestors blocked the Los Angeles freeway . The department said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it's looking into the case to determine whether federal civil rights charges should be filed. Supporters have suggested that Martin's parents file a wrongful-death civil lawsuit against Zimmerman. Zimmerman's lawyers have said he'll seek immunity. Florida's stand your ground law may offer him that immunity if a judge concludes he acted in self-defense, said David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor in Miami.","Drawn from a study using FBI data on homicides between 2005 to 2009 .

"Deep in the waters off Alderney, third largest of the Channel Islands, there lies the wreck of an Elizabethan warship. Sunk there in 1592, it has surrendered many treasures to divers over the years. They include the armour, muskets and cannon proudly displayed in Alderney's museum. But it is an almost forgotten object, long hidden away in the museum's storeroom, that may prove the most momentous find of all. Magical crystal: New research suggests this is a fabled Viking sunstone, which has long been the stuff of legend . Salvaged from the depths in 2002, it looks like a bar of soap and is just as opaque, but only because its surface has been scratched and dulled by sand and seawater over hundreds of years. In its time, it was a gleaming crystal. And in what sounds like something out of a Harry Potter novel, new research suggests that it may be an example of a fabled Viking navigational aid known as a sunstone. Said to have been able to pinpoint the location of the sun even when cloud or fog made it invisible in the skies above, sunstones were once thought to be the stuff of legend. Mystery: Historians have long been puzzled by how the Vikings' nautical prowess in an age before the magnetic compass . The news that the Alderney crystal could be the world's first known specimen is likely to cause almost as big a stir as might the capture of a leprechaun, or the discovery of King Arthur's sword. Yet the claim, about to be published in the Proceedings Of The Royal Society, a journal not known for its frivolity, is being made by respected physicists at the University of Rennes in Brittany. They came across the Alderney crystal as they were puzzling over one of the great maritime mysteries: how to explain the nautical prowess of the Vikings in an age long before the invention of reliable magnetic compasses. These seafaring warriors raped and pillaged their way from Scandinavia to reach not just British shores but also those of North America, where they are believed to have set up colonies as early as the 10th century. This was all the more impressive given the speeds at which they sailed. With figureheads of fierce creatures to intimidate the spirits of the lands they invaded, their longboats were formidable vessels, holding up to 120 men and crashing through the waves at up to 15 knots — almost 20 miles per hour. An error of just a few degrees could take them rapidly off course, and we know that they relied in part on observation of wildlife to tell them where they were. If they saw gannets and guillemots, for example, this told them they were farther out to sea, while sightings of puffins indicated that they were approaching land. It has even been said that a starving raven was kept aboard each vessel in a wooden box. If the crew were really lost, they released the unfortunate bird, knowing that its  'sat-rav' would lead it straight towards the nearest land in search of food. Under the sea: The 'sunstone' was found among a shipwreck off the coast of Alderney, Channel Islands . But the most vital information of all was knowing where they were in relation to the sun. Historians have long wondered how they navigated on the days when weather conditions or the time of the day meant that the sun was out of sight. However, an Icelandic legend about the travels of the Norwegian king Olaf in the 11th century refers to sunstones. Warriors: The seafaring Vikings raped and pillaged their way from Scandinavia to reach not just British shores but also those of North America . One winter's day, Olaf met a farmer's son named Sigurour, who boasted that he could sense the position of the sun even in a snowy sky. The story describes how the assembled company looked out of the window but 'could nowhere see a clear sky'. After asking Sigurour to tell him where the sun was, the king ordered his minions to fetch 'the solar stone' to test the young man's claims. 'He held it up and saw where light radiated from the stone and thus directly verified Sigurour's prediction.' Sunstones are also listed in the inventories of several churches and one monastery in 14th-century Iceland. Yet none has been found and no one could explain how they might have worked. That was until scientists began to investigate a crystal called Icelandic spar, which would have been quite common in the Vikings' homelands. The crystal has a peculiar molecular structure, which means that light passing through it is split into two. Rotating the crystal eventually exposes the point where the two beams converge, and it is this angle that indicates the direction of the sun. In 2007, an international study . headed by Hungarian scientists showed that Icelandic spar could be used . to detect the sun's position in exactly this way, even at twilight or in . overcast conditions. In 2011, the Rennes researchers went further and . demonstrated that the crystal could detect the sun's position to within . one degree. The problem was that there were no surviving examples of anything resembling a sunstone in the form apparently used by ancient sailors. Or so the scientists thought. They were unaware of the finds off Alderney, where the wreck was discovered in 1977 after a rusting Tudor musket became  entangled in nets cast by a lobster fisherman. Sail away: Vikings navigated on days when the weather or time of the day meant the sun was out of sight . The name of the vessel has never been established but historical documents describe just such a ship sinking en route to France, after being dispatched to dissuade the Spanish from renewing their sea-battle against the English following the defeat of the Armada in 1588. In 2002, a dive to the wreck revealed, among many artefacts, the mysterious lump of crystal that is now the focus of international scrutiny. As nobody knew quite what it was, it was put in a safe place and little notice was taken of it until Professor Albert Le Floch, head of the research team, spotted a reference to it on the website run by volunteers of the Alderney Maritime Trust. Navigation: Vikings also used starving ravens to guide them to land if they were really lost . He was further intrigued to discover that, in 2006, a set of brass dividers used for map-reading were also found in the wreck, just 3ft from where the crystal had been found. This encouraged the idea that it had been part of the navigational equipment. Following a visit by Professor Le Floch to the island last year, a small specimen was taken from the rock. And, as the research paper is about to reveal, it has been confirmed as Icelandic spar — which, although common around Alderney, has never been found in blocks like this one, about the size and shape of a cigarette packet. This implies  it was indeed with the stricken ship when it went down. In turn, that raises the question of why the vessel's doomed sailors would have been using such a primitive device when trustworthy compasses had already been invented. Perhaps they were aware, even then, that magnetic compass readings can be affected by the presence of iron objects near by — for example, the huge cast-iron cannons found aboard the ship. 'A second, independent means of verifying the ship's course would have been comforting to these navigators,' says Mike Harrisson, director of the Alderney Maritime Trust. 'Perhaps the Alderney crystal had been handed down from father to son, or master mariner to master mariner, over the ages.' Despite the worldwide headlines, he and the other residents of Alderney — population 2,111 — are not letting their crystal's sudden stardom turn their heads. 'There is no incontrovertible proof that this is a sunstone and we don't want to overstate the case,' Mr Harrisson says. Looking back: Those who arrive in Alderney on boat might want to take a moment to gaze out to the horizon and imagine themselves lost on the empty expanses of ocean beyond . But he admits there are plans for a rejigging of exhibits at the museum in the island's capital, St Anne. Currently languishing in a wooden box with only a purple velvet lining to dignify it as anything other than a nondescript piece of rock, the Alderney crystal may soon be retrieved from the storeroom and honoured with its own display cabinet. This, it is hoped, will attract many more visitors to the island. Those who arrive by boat might want to take a moment to gaze out to the horizon and imagine themselves lost on the empty expanses of ocean beyond. Today, they could rely on the latest technology to get them back to dry land. How different from the Vikings, those marauding mariners who found their way across the high seas with the help of Mother Nature alone — and perhaps those wondrous crystals known as sunstones.","Research suggests crystal salvaged from a shipwreck may be a sunstone .

"A mortar attack on a beach near Donetsk has left children running for their lives as fighting in the pro-Russian rebel stronghold intensifies following the MH17 disaster. The attack took place in the village of Avdiivka, about 15 miles north of the city, and saw the missile crash into a lake - narrowly missing families as they swam and sunbathed in the area. Pro-Kiev troops have been blamed for the attack and it is understood they have since taken control of the village from rebels as part of a wider attempt to wrestle back possession of Donetsk itself. Fear: The amateur footage show a mortar missile landing in the water at a lake near Avdiivka. Families swimming and sunbathing in the area were forced to flee the scene in panic .

The incident has been blamed on pro-Kiev forces who are understood to have forced rebels out of several village in the suburbs north of Donetsk as part of a wider attempt to retake the city itself. The Ukrainian government has denied sending its army in the area and says the villages were retaken by forces loyal to Kiev, but not under their control. The area in and around Donetsk is particularly tense following the death of 298 passengers on board Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 last week . Pro-Kiev troops have been blamed for the attack and it is understood they have since taken control of the village from rebels as part of a wider attempt to wrestle back possession of Donetsk itself . Flee: The person taking the footage is then seen fumbling with his car keys and shouting panicked instructions at his children in Russian while they cower behind the vehicle . Yesterday fighting broke out near the railway station in Donetsk in what separatists said was an attempt by government forces to seize back the east Ukrainian city. The government in Kiev denied sending the regular army into the centre of Donetsk, which the separatists captured in April, but said small 'self-organised' pro-Ukrainian groups were fighting the pro-Russian rebels in the city. Four people were killed in clashes near the railway station and close to the airport outside Donetsk, local health officials said in the industrial city which was home to about one million people before many fled the fighting in the region. Five days after a Malaysian airliner was brought down about 60 km (37 miles) away, rebels are jumpy in Donetsk, one of two cities they still hold after being ousted from several towns by the government forces this month. When a rebel leader reported shooting at the railway station, dozens jumped into minibuses to join the fray and artillery fire sent plumes of smoke skywards. The mortar attack at the lake-side beach in Avdiivka was captured on amateur video on either a mobile phone or a headset-mounted camera . But almost as quickly as the shelling started, it eased, leaving a control tower at the railway station with shattered windows. By early afternoon, local authorities . said the trains were running normally and the station had been only . slightly damaged, but a Reuters witness could still hear shelling. An electricity substation was partially destroyed and people with suitcases were leaving the area. 'It is dangerous near the railway station!' the Donetsk city council said in a statement on its website after the shooting began, asking residents in the area to stay indoors. It said a nine-storey house had been damaged in the shelling and that transport had been halted in the area. 'In the morning there were explosions, people are extremely worried,' said a local resident who gave her name as Natalya. Shelter: The incident has been blamed on pro-Kiev forces who are understood to have forced rebels out of several village in the suburbs north of Donetsk as part of a wider attempt to retake the city itself . Escape: The camera pans out across the lake, where smoke from the missile can still be seen in the air . Donetsk is central to the rebel uprising against rule by Kiev, and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has vowed to retake the city as part of what Kiev calls its 'anti-terrorist operation' against the separatists. He has, however, instructed the army not to fight within a 40 km (25 mile) diameter of the site where Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 came down on Thursday, killing all 298 people on board. But that does not cover Donetsk. A statement from the headquarters of the 'anti-terrorist operation' said the army had taken control over a suburb of Donetsk and the president said soldiers were 'freeing' the village of Dzerzhinsk, about 60 km north of Donetsk. Show of strength: Ukrainian troops are pictured driving in front of cars in the east Ukrainian town of Konstantinovka, a few miles north of the village of Avdiivka .

"A witness in the Oscar Pistorius trial posted a Facebook message bemoaning that his reputation was being 'destroyed' by the prosecutor - but vowed to mark the end of his testimony with a pint. Forensics expert and geologist Roger Dixon has been called to cast doubt on the prosecution's account that the Paralympian deliberately shot Reeva Steenkamp during a fight. But the former police officer found himself being repeatedly, and at times mockingly, accused of not being qualified . to give evidence by state prosecutor Gerrie Nel. After a bruising day of cross-examination yesterday, Mr Dixon wrote on his Facebook account last night that he was bracing himself for much of the same today. To make matters worse - having told the court he did not . have a television or radio and had not followed the . state’s case because it was 'better not to be influenced by external . factors' - his Twitter account was discovered, revealing that he had . re-tweeted earlier coverage of the trial.

Writing on Facebook, he said: 'Third day in court today. Let's see how much of my credibility, integrity and professional reputation is destroyed. 'It is difficult to get belief in those who will not listen because it is not what they want to hear. After that, beer!' A picture of the message - apparently shown on a mobile phone screen - was posted on Twitter this morning. Mr Dixon later confirmed the Twitter and Facebook accounts belonged to him. He is also said to have told reporters during a break in the hearing that he had been inundated with 'hate mail' because of his involvement in the case. Accused of being 'evasive': Mr Dixon holds a magazine rack as he discusses the sequence of shots that hit Miss Steenkamp when she was in the toilet . Mr Dixon has offered a different sequence . for the shots that killed Reeva Steenkamp, contradicting testimony by a . police ballistics expert and the pathologist who performed the autopsy. However, . he has appeared unsteady during his cross-examination as Mr Nel warned . him it was irresponsible to 'try and be an expert' in areas he was not. Mr Nel asserted in his . cross-examination that Mr Dixon was not an expert in light, sound, . ballistics, gunshot wounds or pathology - all areas about which he was . testifying. Mr Dixon worked . at the police forensic laboratory in Pretoria until he left the force in . December 2012. He was a specialist in analysing materials at crime . scenes.

'For an expert you are evasive,' Nel said, prompting the judge at one point to tell the energetic prosecutor to 'restrain' himself. The prosecutor also criticised Dixon for not bringing photographs and his written reports with him and abruptly told him to bring them on Thursday. 'I said I will,' Mr Dixon snapped back. 'Good,' Mr Nel responded. Nel ridiculed Dixon's finding about the sequence of the shots that Pistorius fired at Steenkamp through the door, testimony which contradicted that of a police ballistics expert and state pathologist Professor Gert Saayman. 'I use the word ""finding"" very loosely,' Mr Nel said wryly of Dixon's theory. Pistorius denies pre-meditated murder.

"Happy Mondays star Paul Ryder has revealed how he treated his 11-year-old son's cancer with cannabis. The bass player and one of the founding members of the Manchester band, told MailOnline as a recovering addict he would never have encouraged Chico to take drugs. But when faced with his son's diagnosis - a rare form of soft tissue cancer - the musician said he and his wife took the decision to use cannabis oil. Chico fell ill in November 2012, complaining of a sore throat. Scroll down for video . Happy Mondays bass player Paul Ryder has revealed he treated his son Chico's cancer with cannabis oil. The recovering drug addict, pictured with his son, said he and his wife took the decision with the backing of Chico's doctors in Los Angeles . Eleven-year-old Chico fell ill with a sore throat in November 2012. Just weeks later, he was diagnosed with a rare soft tissue cancer, rhabdomyosarcoma . Chico's father, Paul Ryder, pictured far right with his bandmates, including Chico's uncle Shaun Ryder, third left, said he and his wife Angela decided to take their son's treatment a step further, giving him doses of cannabis oil through a stomach tube, with the full support of his medical team . But just weeks after Christmas his family received the devastating diagnosis - he was suffering the cancer rhabdomyosarcoma. Doctors in Los Angeles, where the family now live, prescribed a synthetic form of cannabis to ease the side effects of the chemotherapy such as nausea and vomiting. But Chico's parents took the treatment one step further, giving their 11-year-old son cannabis oil, through his stomach tube - with the full support of his medical team. Lib Dem minister Norman Baker has become the latest high profile name to call for cannabis to be legalised for medical use. Paul, 49, originally from Salford, told MailOnline: 'I found myself coaching him on how to inhale cannabis vapour from a vapourising machine. 'It was surreal - but it worked brilliantly, and gave him instant relief. 'My drug problems have been well documented. I nearly lost my life. But now they are being used instead to help Chico.' Chico's illness came as a huge shock to his parents and older brother Sonny, 12. His mother Angela, 50, said: 'Before he became ill, he was a normal, energetic little boy. He loved skate-boarding, dirt-biking and football. 'Everything was going well until we were hit with an almighty bombshell.' A sore throat didn’t clear up and a swelling appeared on the side of Chico's neck. Initial tests for lymphoma were clear – and the family breathed a sigh of relief. Doctors told Chico's family surgery was too risky and that he would need rounds of chemotherapy and radiation to treat his disease. They prescribed the drug Marinol - a synthetic form of cannabis - to help ease the effects of the treatment . Paul told MailOnline: 'I found myself coaching him (Chico, pictured) on how to inhale cannabis vapour from a vapourising machine. My drug problems have been well documented. I nearly lost my life. But now they are being used instead to help Chico' Dr Kat Arney, Cancer Research UK’s science communications manager, told MailOnline: 'We know that cannabinoids – the active chemicals found in cannabis – can have a range of different effects on cancer cells grown in the lab and animal tumours. 'But at the moment there isn’t good evidence from clinical trials to prove that they can safely and effectively treat cancer in patients. 'Despite this, we are aware that some cancer patients do choose to treat themselves with cannabis extracts. 'These stories can help researchers build a picture of whether these treatments are helping or not, although this is weak evidence compared to properly-run clinical trials. 'Cancer Research UK is supporting clinical trials for treating cancer with cannabis extract and a synthetic cannabinoid. 'In order to gather solid data on how best these drugs can be used to benefit people with cancer.' But five days before Christmas 2012, he became very ill. With Paul away on tour with the newly reformed band, Angela kept him updated with texts. And one night, as he was about to take to the stage in London, his phone bleeped with news which was to change his life. 'They are admitting him into hospital for more tests. 50-50 chance it’s cancer,' the message read. Paul said: 'I was in a daze throughout the gig, I can’t remember playing at all. 'It was like I was on autopilot, just going through the motions, not being able to think of anything else other than my family so far away and the fact that Chico’s life might be in danger.' His wife, said: 'By this time the swelling had grown much bigger. 'The doctors said he only had 10 more days before it would completely block his airways. 'We were worried sick. 'We laid all his presents in his hospital room on Christmas Day, but he had no interest in them. Chico's mother Angela, said: 'The Marinol worked a little at the beginning, but we were told that real cannabis worked much better. I never in a million years imagined that I would ever be buying cannabis oil for my 11-year-old son and giving him relatively high amounts of it down his stomach tube' 'It was so surreal to know that the rest of the world was oblivious, enjoying the festivities, tucking into turkey and having happy family times, while we were stuck in a hospital, dealing with our worst nightmare.' Three days after Christmas, Chico, then 10, was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma. Paul told MailOnline: 'I walked in there, to his hospital room and I just lost it, he looked so sick and frail. I went straight into the bathroom and threw up.' It was the start of a battle which would see Chico cheat death more than once – while his father and uncle, Happy Mondays front man Shaun Ryder, hid their secret heartache from fans. 'My drug problems have been well documented. I nearly lost my life. But now they are being used instead to help Chico' - Happy Mondays bassist, Paul Ryder . His wife said: 'Shaun was shell-shocked; he sent text messages to Paul saying he couldn’t believe it and how he wished we weren’t so far away. 'Like most people, he just didn’t know what to say.' Surgery was too risky, and so Chico began a 43-week course of chemotherapy, along with radiation. Doctors prescribed a drug called Marinol – a synthetic form of cannabis – to ease the chemo nausea. Angela said: 'The Marinol worked a little at the beginning, but we were told that real cannabis worked much better. 'So because we were living in a state where medical cannabis is legal with a doctor’s  recommendation, we asked the doctors for approval, and they agreed. 'As they saw how beneficial it was for Chico, they were very supportive. 'I never in a million years imagined that I would ever be buying cannabis oil for my 11-year-old son and giving him relatively high amounts of it down his stomach tube. 'What isn’t quite so widely known is that cannabis also seems to have the ability to actually fight the cancer itself, as well as mitigating the side effects of the chemo.' Chico's uncle, and Happy Mondays front man, Shaun Ryder, said: 'Our Chico kicked cancer, he is a real fighter' For Paul, the irony of giving drugs to his son was not lost. He told MailOnline: 'I am a recovering addict and haven’t had a drink or drug for many years, so there’s no way I would ever have encouraged my son to take cannabis. 'But when Angela told me what she had discovered I couldn’t really argue and had to agree that we had to get some for him. 'It was the best thing we could have done. In my opinion it’s a medicine not a drug, and thank goodness we were living in California. 'Our Chico kicked cancer, he's a real fighter' - Uncle and Happy Mondays front man, Shaun Ryder . 'We built up the dose slowly as his tolerance rose. It made a big difference in his overall well-being. 'It definitely made the treatment more tolerable. He started to smile. It certainly didn’t solve every problem but it helped make his life more bearable through the treatment.' In December last year, the family got the best news they could have hoped for – Chico was in remission. His mother said: 'Chico has lost his hair and needs a wheelchair from the side effects of his treatment, but we know he’ll be back on his feet soon. 'He still has a very cheeky sense of humour and he can’t wait to return to normal life.' Paul and his band mates are now planning their first ever black tie ball for Chico - and hope the little boy will be well enough to fly to the UK as guest of honour. His uncle, Shaun, said: 'Our Chico kicked cancer, he is a real fighter.' In December last year, Chico's parents Angela and Paul, and his older brother Sonny, front right, received the news they longed for, the 11-year-old was in remission .","Chico Ryder, son of Happy Mondays star Paul, was diagnosed with a rare soft tissue cancer shortly after Christmas 2012 .

"Cristiano Ronaldo is reportedly set to become the subject of a four-year degree at a university in Canada. The University of British Columbia Okanagan is to start up a sociology degree focusing on the cultural importance of Ronaldo’s fame and its effects on the society. Even though the course won't be based around his step overs or his powerful free kicks, Professor Luis Aguiar says the Real Madrid star will be heavily talked about. Ronaldo (centre) is to be the subject of a sociology degree at the University of British Columbia Okanagan . Speaking in a recent interview he said: 'Ronaldo is the centre and every discussion, class meeting revolves around Ronaldo initially. And then we explore, we broaden out to larger themes. 'So it starts with Ronaldo but Ronaldo is almost like a springboard to talk about larger issues that are much more sociologically significant than just a biography of Ronaldo.' Aguiar also admitted that he wasn't sure if the Portuguese star knew about the course but offered him an open invitation to talk to future classes. 'I don't know if Ronaldo knows about the course. 'I haven't heard from Ronaldo, I haven't heard from his entourage,' he adds. 'I would love to hear from either one, and I would love to have Ronaldo maybe Skyping into the class.'

"Covertly tapping the top of someone's newly opened beer bottle and then standing back as the suds foam out onto the floor is a classic old party trick. Now Spanish and French researchers are toasting their discovery of the science behind the phenomenon. Lead researcher Javier Rodriguez-Rodriguez, of Carlos III University in Spain, said cavitation - a phenomenon relevant to such common engineering concerns as erosion of ship propellers - is the mechanism by which bubbles appear in a liquid such as beer after an impact. Scroll down for video . Cheers: The science of foaming beer explained . After a sudden bump against a . bottle's mouth, back and forth movement of compression and expansion . waves will cause bubbles to appear and quickly collapse. The team's investigation of beer . bottle-fluid interactions demonstrated that the cavitation-induced . break-up of larger ‘mother’ bubbles creates clouds of very small . carbonic gas ‘daughter bubbles’ which grow and expand much faster than . the larger mother-bubbles from which they split. The rapid expansion of . these daughter bubbles gives the foam buoyancy. Dr Rodriguez-Rodriguez said: ‘Buoyancy . leads to the formation of plumes full of bubbles, whose shape resembles . very much the mushrooms seen after powerful explosions. Scroll down for video . Mystery solved: Researchers found that tapping a beer bottle's glass creates 'mother' bubbles, then daughter bubbles that give the foam buoyancy . When the top of a beer bottle is tapped, foam suddenly rushes upwards. Here's why: . ‘And here is what really makes the formation of foam so explosive: the larger the bubbles get, the faster they rise, and the other way around.’ He said this is because fast-moving bubbles entrain more carbonic gas. The team's work is believed to be the first quantitative analysis of the beer bottle foam-over. Dr . Rodriguez-Rodriguez added: ‘We wanted to explain the extremely high . efficiency of the degasification process that occurs in a beer bottle . within the first few seconds after the impact.’ He said the findings of the study, . presented at the annual meeting of the American Physical Society (APS) Division of Fluid Dynamics, can also be applied to other engineering . systems. and help experts understand serious natural phenomena such as . the sudden release of dissolved carbon dioxide in the 1986 Lake Nyos . disaster.

"Our Man In Havana has a certain ring: somehow it sounds so much better than 'Our Woman in Havana' - or Paris, Washington, Moscow or Tel Aviv. That, at least, was the view of the British Foreign Office until well into the 20th century. Women served with distinction in diplomatic roles during the two World Wars, and the Foreign Office was happy to make use of the talents of mavericks such as intrepid travellers Gertrude Bell and Freya Stark. Intrepid: Freya Stark aged 77 in Nepal . And British diplomacy abroad was underpinned by the selfless (unpaid) efforts of diplomatic wives - who undertook the thankless task of ensuring the social side of embassy life ran smoothly. Yet in 1936, the Inter-Departmental Committee On The Admission Of Women To The Diplomatic And Consular Services concluded after two years of deliberation that 'the time has not yet arrived when women could be employed either in the Consular Service or in the Diplomatic Service with advantage to the State or with profit to women'. A Punch cartoon of the time showed a fashionable miss wearing an outrageously skimpy evening gown, perched on a brocade sofa with her feet on a tiger-skin rug, gnashing her teeth outside a firmly closed door labelled 'Foreign Office'. The caption read 'Foiled!'. A decade later, the committee's conclusion was at last reversed and women were allowed to compete for posts in the Foreign Office, but until 1973 women diplomats who married had to resign. 'We doubt whether it will often happen that a woman will wish to remain in the Diplomatic Service after marriage,' concluded Lord Plowden's mid-Sixties review of Britain's overseas representation. 'In most cases, it will be her intention to settle down with her husband in this country or wherever he may be living.' Even after the abolition of the marriage bar, promising female diplomats who had the temerity to get married were likely to find their careers stalled, if not entirely blighted. The earliest contribution from a male spouse to the diplomatic spouses' magazine was in 1985, when one Guy Digby sent in a daring proposal to form a Diplomatic Service Husbands' Association, which would organise 'beer evenings' and 'poker afternoons'. Pioneer: Gertrude Bell was archaeologist and explorer . Another diplomatic husband, Alex Sutherland, turned up at the wives' session on a heads of missions training day and was startled to hear the speaker announce that 'never, never, never should we leave the bedroom in the morning without having put on our make-up and our earrings'. But as Helen McCarthy observes in her thought-provoking and vividly readable history of women's diplomacy, the urbane mandarins of the Foreign Office became almost animated in their determination to exclude women from a diplomatic career. Not that they put it in such blunt terms. Along with the 'drunken sailor' argument against women diplomats, there was also the problem of that unsophisticated and misogynistic figure, Johnny Foreigner. As the distinguished Old Etonian permanent secretary Sir Robert Vansittart wrote in an eight-page memo in 1934, 'He [the foreign male] is not ready for the experiment. It is surely a false argument to say that, because we treat women as equal to men in this country, an Englishwoman abroad will be so treated by foreigners. She will not.' Yet as McCarthy points out, the Foreign Office never hesitated to make use of women's expertise when it was convenient - even in regions that it officially considered impossible for women to work in. The Oxford graduate, linguist and travel writer Gertrude Bell gained a remarkable knowledge of the remoter parts of the Middle East and was elected to the Royal Geographical Society, which had only recently opened its membership to women, in June 1913. Soon after the declaration of war in 1914, the War Office wrote to her, asking her to produce a memo on the likely Arab response in the event of a British offensive against the Turks in the south-eastern Mediterranean. £12,890: How much more on average male diplomats earned than women last year . By 1920, Bell's Review Of The Civil Administration Of Mesopotamia was published as a White Paper and she was acknowledged as a serious player in Middle East politics. Paradoxically, she was hostile to feminism, a position she shared with numerous diplomatic wives, including Lady Granville, wife of the 3rd Earl of Granville, the Ambassador to Brussels, who argued that women could best serve their country by supplying wifely support. 'I have quite a decent brain,' she told the 1934 Inter-Departmental Committee, 'but I should not have thought at any moment of my life that I was capable of doing what my husband was doing.' The rise of feminism in the Seventies dealt a mortal blow to such attitudes, though female recruits to the Foreign Office were still refused the opportunity of learning languages such as Arabic and, oddly, Japanese. Women who queried the policy were grandly told - in an economical recycling of the old 'Johnny Foreigner' argument of the Thirties - that the Foreign Office had no choice but to 'take account of the fact that social attitudes remain in a number of countries which make it difficult for women to operate effectively in some jobs'. Despite Robin Cook's reforms in the mid-Nineties, McCarthy concludes that the Foreign Office still struggles with its legacy of masculine privilege. But her intelligent, witty and elegantly written book celebrates the remarkable tenacity of the women who defied that legacy.","Women were once banned from a diplomatic career .

"A North Dakota school has come under fire for suggesting that some of its female pupils dress like prostitutes. In a bid enforce its dress code, Devil's Lake High School showed students a clip from Pretty Woman in which the character played by Julia Roberts is humiliated in a shop for looking like a sex worker. When she returns the next day in high-end clothing, she gets a far warmer reception. Scroll down for video . Stunt: Julia Roberts with Richard Gere in Pretty Woman after her character Vivian Ward is humiliated in a clothes store for looking like a prostitute. The clip from the film was shown to female pupils at Devil's Lake High School in North Dakota in an attempt by bosses to get girls to adhere to its dress code, much to their anger . Bosses said they hoped the footage will discourage girls from dressing provocatively in tight pants and leggings. But students reacted with anger at the stunt after it was shown during a dress code assembly and the principal was later forced to admit the tactic was a poor choice. One pupil said: 'I get how that lady (in Pretty Woman) was judged by what she was wearing, but we don't wear that kind of stuff to school.' Psychotherapist Dr Stacy Kaiser said the message could be damaging to the girls in the longer term. The principal at Devil's Lake High School (above) was later forced to admit the tactic was a poor choice . She told ABC7: 'The message it is sending to the girls is that they dress like prostitutes. 'And they are sexualizing them instead of treating them with self-respect.' The backlash at Devil's Lake has sparked a wave of reaction across the United States, with pupils in other schools  taking issue with the public shaming of girls for not wearing the correct uniform. Often, these schools are sending them home, saying their clothes are distracting the boys. One group of students at a middle school in New Jersey has launched the hashtag #IAmMoreThanADistraction campaign to press for a fairer dress code policy that doesn't discriminate girls. Dr Kaiser said: 'This message is telling boys that if a girl is dressed in a provocative way, they have a green light to behave any way that want. And that can be very dangerous.'","Devil's Lake High School in North Dakota under fire for 'dangerous' tactics .

"eXCLUSIVE By . Jason Groves and Christian Gysin . Criticism: In a statement on her website, Halifax MP Linda Riordan, pictured, said she would cease renting her £400,000 South London flat to fellow Labour MP Iain McKenzie . A left-wing MP is pocketing £19,000 a year from the taxpayer by renting out her second home to a Labour MP – while claiming thousands in expenses to rent a third property for herself. Linda Riordan is today revealed as one of four MPs involved in the controversial practice of renting out their taxpayer-funded second homes to fellow MPs for profit. The practice is technically permitted under the supposedly tough new expenses regime imposed in the wake of the expenses scandal. But critics last night warned it broke the spirit of the rules – and recalled the worst excesses of the scandal that heaped shame on Parliament three years ago. Commons Speaker John Bercow has now launched a bid to block the publication of details of MPs’ landlords which would reveal which other MPs are involved. Halifax MP Mrs Riordan, a member of the Socialist Campaign Group, rents out her £400,000 London flat to fellow Labour MP Iain McKenzie. Mr McKenzie pays her £1,560 a month in rent – equal to £18,720 a year – which he claims back from the taxpayer. Official records show that Mrs Riordan’s mortgage fell to £562 a month in 2009 when interest rates hit their current low level. Assuming the rate is unchanged, she is now making £1,000 a month in clear profit from the rental payments to supplement her MPs’ salary of £65,738. At the same time, Mrs Riordan, 59, claims £1,473 a month – equal to £17,676 a year – from the taxpayer for renting a separate flat in London for herself. She also has a home in Northowram, Halifax, which she has owned outright for more than 20 years. The arrangement means she now has three properties, two of which are funded by the taxpayer. Mrs Riordan, a widow, also employs her 51-year-old partner Stephen Roberts as a ‘senior researcher’ on a taxpayer-funded salary of up to £42,000. She did not respond to calls last night . and Mr Roberts declined to comment. But Mr McKenzie confirmed he was . renting from Mrs Riordan – and admitted he felt uneasy about it. Portfolio: Riordan's £400,000 London flat which she rented to fellow Labour MP Iain McKenzie for £1,560 a month . The Inverclyde MP, who was elected at a by-election last year on a promise to ‘win back the trust of the people’, said he rented the flat via an estate agent and had not realised it was owned by a fellow MP until her post started arriving. Mr McKenzie said he had checked the arrangement with the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) when he discovered Mrs Riordan was his landlady. He added: ‘Ipsa said there was nothing to stop MPs renting out their flats, MPs are allowed to do it. But if I am honest, I would not do it and if I had known beforehand that the flat was owned by an MP then I probably wouldn’t have taken it. You’ve got to apply the test of how it . looks to the man in the street, regardless of whether it’s above board . or not.’ Mr McKenzie stressed he made no money from the arrangement. MPs . were banned from claiming for their mortgages on expenses as part of a . bid to clean up Parliament. Instead they get an allowance of up to . £20,000 a year. The ban finally came into force last month. Tenant: Iain McKenzie, pictured with his wife Alison McKenzie, had confirmed he was renting the property . Ipsa said four MPs are now renting to fellow MPs. Another four rent from former MPs whose homes were subsidised for years by the taxpayer. Official records show around 50 MPs . claim rental expenses from the taxpayer while renting out their own . homes in London or their constituency. Commons Speaker John Bercow has launched a bid to block the publication of details of MPs' landlords which would reveal which other MPs are involved . Mrs Riordan, who was elected in 2005, bought the flat for £300,000 in 2006. Records show the taxpayer contributed more than £35,000 to the cost of her mortgage between 2007 and 2010. Total payments are thought to top £50,000. Other claims relating to the flat include £1,310 for a sofa bed, £219 for bedding, and £1,936 for carpets. She also routinely claimed the maximum £400 a month for food – all without receipts – and claimed £100 a month for a cleaner until the practice was banned. Last night Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It was the cry that “it’s all within the rules” combined with attempts to suppress the publication of claims that made the MPs’ expenses crisis three years ago so toxic. ‘Whilst the rules may not technically prevent MPs from renting properties to one another, it is certainly against the spirit of those rules.’ Tory MP Julian Lewis, who has campaigned for MPs’ addresses to be kept secret on security grounds, also criticised the arrangement, and called for a change in the rules. He said: ‘If it turns out MPs are doing this then people should be tackling Ipsa, asking why they are allowing it and, if necessary, changing the rules.’","Halifax MP Linda Riordan renting her .

"Over in Hollywood, where it is practically a crime to grow old, Diane Keaton is in constant danger of being arrested by the youth police. ‘Just yesterday,’ she writes in the introduction to her endearingly dotty memoir about the ups and downs of ageing, ‘Dexter, my 18-year-old daughter, found a story online called “Top 10 Female Celebrities Who Are Ugly No Matter What Hollywood Says”.’ Number 1 on the roll-call of shame was Angelina Jolie (‘She looks like Skeletor  from He-Man’). At number 4, Reese Witherspoon (‘What can I say about this genetic mistake?’) Pretty fabulous: Diane is still a big name in Hollywood, despite the lack of roles for women her age . ‘Dexter kept scrolling,’ Keaton continues, ‘and there was the fifth-ugliest female celebrity . . . Diane Keaton: “How this chick got a lead role in anything is beyond me . . . It’s not because she’s as old as dirt . . .  She’s even ugly in the Godfather when she was young.”’ ‘Wow,’ Keaton thinks — a remarkably restrained reaction in the circumstances. But after the initial shock, she rallies bravely: ‘These old-as-dirt days have one advantage: I’ve learned to see beauty where I never saw it before . . . When I was in my 20s and 30s I wanted my appearance to be more interesting than the beauty that surrounded me. It was a fool’s folly.’ To an outsider, Keaton’s life seems to have been pretty fabulous so far. For those of us old enough to remember Annie Hall, Woody Allen’s 1977 semi-autobiographical movie based on his relationship with Keaton, she is forever the adorable, ditzy girl whose tomboy get-up inspired a generation to dress in their grandfather’s cast-offs — baggy trousers, men’s shirts and woolly waistcoats, topped with a bowler hat. At 68, she is still working, pursuing her interests in photography and property development alongside an acting career that cheerfully disproves the adage about there being no roles for older women in Hollywood. And at an age when most people would be settling gratefully into grandparenthood, she is the single parent of two children — an 18-year-old daughter, Dexter,  whom she adopted in 1996, followed in 2001 by a son, Duke, now 12. Tomboy chic: In Annie Hall with Woody Allen in 1977 . Yet as Keaton tells it, she has been a martyr to low self-esteem since she was a little girl. These days we may suspect that she suffers from a more sophisticated variant of the syndrome — faux low self-esteem, widely adopted by successful celebrities in an attempt to stop their public from detesting them. But her account of her insecurity as a young woman makes painful reading. In her earlier memoir, Then Again, she wrote about her struggles with bulimia in her 20s. This time she recalls her teenage obsession with her imperfect looks. On August 8, 1960, aged 14, she wrote a list of beauty ‘corrections’ in her diary. 1. Sleep with a bobby pin stuck on tip of my nose. Tilt it to the left where the bulb is fat . 2. Spend time practising a series  of smiles . 3. Exercise my eyes for 30 minutes a day. Open them as wide as possible, then shut them tight . . . Try exercising in Civics class where Mrs Clark is frequently distracted . . . Alas, the bobby pin left a mark on her nose that took half an hour to wear off, and when she practised her smile on a boy she fancied, the results were disappointing: ‘As I slowly turned my face to his and smiled with a glow that came from the heart, he said: ‘Hey, Diaps, what’s the matter? You look weird.”’ Keaton suffered 26 tooth cavities as a result of bulimia . The failure of the ‘corrections’ to improve her looks did nothing to deter her from a lifelong campaign to ‘right my wrongs’. The struggle with her hair, she writes, ‘has dogged me all my life’. The solution — a multifarious assortment  of wigs, berets and assorted headgear — had the handy side-effect  of disguising her ears. ‘Because, let’s face it, my ears were, and remain, just one more of my  many disappointments.’ You’d think that having spent so long in Hollywood, a neighbourhood more densely populated with plastic surgeons than anywhere  in the world, Keaton might have been tempted to take advantage of their skills. But she claims to have resisted: ‘The question is, how far am I willing to go? Particularly at this age . . . I can’t say exactly why I haven’t turned to surgery or fillers, at least not yet . . .  Maybe I don’t want to change my everyday me because I can’t picture what I will look like . . .  I tell myself to hold on to authenticity. But am I authentic? . . .  All I know is I’m sick of worrying about my authenticity.’ The theme of loss permeates Keaton’s book — lost looks, lost love, lost dignity, lost homes (try as she may, she can’t stop herself from moving every couple of years). Sweet stuff: Diane's memoir is endearingly quirky and unexpectedly wise . There is a memorably bonkers vignette of herself, walking backwards with her long-suffering dog, Emmie, on the advice of Dr Tan, her acupuncturist, who assures her that it will ‘employ the unutilised part of  my brain’, thus warding  off dementia. Alas, while warding off dementia, she falls over a rock and breaks  her toe. This is the fifth time it has happened, thanks to her penchant for walking around without shoes, to the intense chagrin of her son, who declines to be seen with her when she is shoeless. Especially when she goes jogging barefoot, clasping a mug of Layer Cake Cabernet with ice (‘I never jog without a chaser of red wine on  the rocks’). Still, for every minor disaster, there is a sunny upside. In the chapter headed Old Is Gold — an adorably inconsequential celebration of her friendships with ‘65 and older showbusiness folk’, Keaton takes a day off filming with Rob Reiner and Michael Douglas to hang out in New York. ‘I had a few hours to kill, so I took a chance and called Woody, [and] asked him if he wanted to take a walk on Madison Avenue, like we used to.’ Around 79th Street, ‘We ran into Paul McCartney and his wife, Nancy. People gathered around us. It was almost like it used to be, only sweeter, because I knew it couldn’t last.’ Come to think of it, if you were summing up the essence of  the ditzy, barefoot, backwards-walking, 68-year-old author of  this endearingly quirky and unexpectedly wise memoir, you could hardly do better. Diane Keaton — almost like she used to be, only sweeter. out of an abandoned drawer. A beautiful book for all ages.","Still working in Hollywood aged 68 .

"A saltwater crocodile up to four metres long cleared a popular Australian beach on the weekend after it was spotted lurking in the water. Broome’s Cable Beach, in Western Australia, is a major tourism hotspot – attracting thousands of people to the 22km stretch every year. But the popular beach was closed on Saturday after the male crocodile was seen lazing about in knee-deep water for the entire day. Catching waves: The four-metre saltwater crocodile closed Broome's popular Cable Beach for a day before it moved on . Broome woman Sharon Scoble said she was amazed by how big the reptile was. ‘He was a big boy - his head was huge,’ she said. ‘It would be all over red rover if he got hold of you.’ The croc did not show signs of aggression, but Ms Scoble said it was looking at people on the beach. ‘I felt really humbled but you probably wouldn’t feel that way if you were out there on a paddle board or having a swim,"" she said. By Sunday morning, the crocodile had moved on. Parks and Wildlife senior operation officer Dave Woods said he believed it was the same crocodile that had been spotted in a number of locations in the area around December. Rolling in the deep: A four-metre crocodile was caught surfing at Broome's iconic Cable Beach in Western Australia . He estimated it was 3.5 metres to four metres long. Officials are now searching for the animal in order to move it to the Malcolm Douglas Wilderness Park, 16km east of Broome. The sighting follows the disappearance of a 12-year-old boy last month, who was taken by a saltwater crocodile while swimming with friends in the Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory. In that incident, witnesses saw the crocodile approach the group and bite a 15-year-old boy on the arm. The reptile, dubbed one of Australia’s most dangerous predators, let go of the 15-year-old when he began to fight back and turned on the 12-year-old, before swimming off with him. Experts said the ‘wet season’ is the most dangerous time to be swimming in waterholes and creeks.","A four-metre long saltwater crocodile spotted in water at Cable Beach .

"An atmospheric shot of a greylag goose under a stormy London sky has won this year's British Wildlife Photography Awards. The picture, entitled 'The Tourist', by Lee Acaster from Wortham, Suffolk, captures the goose in close-up by the River Thames with part of the London skyline, including the Shard skyscraper, in the background. The shot beat thousands of entries in the annual photographic awards to win the urban wildlife category of the competition and scoop the top prize of £5,000 for the overall winning image. This shot of a Greylag Goose taken by photographer Lee Acaster in London won this year's prize, with the competition's judge praising it's 'extraordinary' impact . This shocking image of an otter capturing a hapless puffin - taken by Richard Shucksmith in the Shetland Isles - won the animal behaviour category . This pair of blue sharks appear to be dancing in a photo taken underwater in Cornwall by Alexander Mustard, winner of the coast and marine category . Mr Acaster said of his picture: 'It was a real privilege to have such a close encounter with a wild bird in the very heart of London. 'I vividly remember the excitement I felt as she patiently waited for me to get the shot, and I knew immediately this was a once in a lifetime opportunity, I'm just grateful that she didn't lose interest as quickly as my children do when I'm taking photographs of them.' Competition judge Mark Ward, editor-in-chief at the RSPB's Nature's Home magazine, said: 'The winning photograph shows a familiar bird in a familiar setting, but the visual impact is extraordinary. 'The stormy, brooding backdrop sets a dramatic scene, while the orange and pink from the bird bring vibrancy to the monochromatic cityscape. 'Lee's stunning photograph proves you do not have to travel far from home to capture the very best of Britain's wildlife images.' Striking images of a shag resting, a puffin in the jaws of an otter, a gannet breeding colony, a close-up of a seal's claw and a telephone box being reclaimed by nature are among the winning photographs. A beautiful photo looking down on a rock covered in nesting gannets  won the habitat category after it was taken in the Shetland Islands by photographer Ruth Asher . A photo of a fox on the prowl (left) taken by Joshua Burch in south London won the 12-18 You People category and a snap of a shag resting (right) taken in Northumberland by Steven Fairbrother won the animals portraits category .

"The Royal Navy launched an unarmed warhead in an awe-inspiring display of Britain's powerful nuclear deterrent. The Trident II was blasted into the sky by HMS Vigilant, a nuclear-powered Vanguard Class submarine, in the Atlantic just off the coast of Florida. The Navy has not test-fired a ballistic missile since 2009. Navy chiefs said the successful launch confirms the credibility of the UK's nuclear deterrent. Scroll down for video . Launch: A still taken from video of the missile firing from HMS Vigilant . Soaring: The missile streaks into the sky over the Atlantic Ocean . First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope said: 'The Royal Navy has for over 43 years continuously operated the UK’s nuclear deterrent to stringent safety standards and HMS Vigilant’s latest test firing before she returns to the patrol cycle reflects that successful deterrence is based upon strong determination. 'One of the core roles of the Royal Navy, the Continuous At Sea Deterrent remains an enduring strategic capability, underpinning our nation’s commitment to the preservation of peace in our uncertain world.' News of the launch comes at the same time Defence Secretary Philip Hammond announced an additional £350M worth of funding for the next stage of design work for Successor, the future generation of UK nuclear-armed submarines. Ready: HMS Vigilant preparing to fire an unarmed Trident II. The launch was the first of its type in three years . Tension: The sub's weapons engineering officer pulling the trigger to fire the missile . He added that the investment will sustain 1,200 UK jobs and makes clear the Government’s commitment to maintaining a deterrence for future decades. The funding follows the initial £350M of design work announced earlier this year. The Vanguard submarines will be replaced from 2028 by the Successor, which is currently being designed by British companies. Britain's nuclear subs are based at Faslane on the River Clyde in Scotland and uncertainty surrounds its future should the Scottish vote for independence in 2014. The SNP wants to remove the subs from the site, bhe Royal Navy says all Royal Navy submarines will be based at Faslane by 2017, including the Astute and Trafalgar class attack submarines. The successful launch took place off the coast of Florida in the U.S. and used America's telemetry and tracking systems . Mr Hammond claims the site is secure. He said: 'We are confident that the Scottish people will choose to remain part of the United Kingdom. 'The Faslane complex is the largest employment site in Scotland with over 6,500 jobs underpinning the local economy. 'We have no plans to move the nuclear deterrent from the Clyde. On the contrary, we intend to move the Astute and Trafalgar Class attack submarines to Faslane, creating a further 1,500 jobs. 'The Scottish Government needs to explain how their policy would benefit Scotland’s economy and safeguard Scottish jobs.'

"Israel has destroyed a Sudanese weapons factory in a bombing raid, it was claimed yesterday.Sudan vowed to take ‘decisive steps’ in retaliation against Israeli interests, which it said are now ‘legitimate targets’. The Yarmouk arms factory, in the south of the capital Khartoum, was destroyed in a series of explosions on Wednesday last week, in which two people died. Sudan immediately pointed the finger of blame at Israel, while an American monitoring group said satellite images of the aftermath of the explosion suggest the site was hit in an airstrike. The Yarmouk military complex in Khartoum, Sudan seen in a satellite image made on October 12, prior to the alleged attack . A satellite picture of the military complex after the alleged raid taken on October 25 . The images showed ‘six large  craters, each approximately 16 metres across and consistent with large impact craters created by  air-delivered munitions. They were centred in a location where, until recently, some 40  shipping containers had been stacked’, according to the Satellite Sentinel Project. There were claims yesterday that Israel attacked the factory because it was a front for manufacturing rockets and ballistic missiles for Iran. There were also reports that the raid acted as a ‘dry run’ for a forthcoming strike on Iran’s  nuclear facilities. Israel has so far made no comment on the destruction of the factory, as has become conventional when it is accused of attacking targets in nearby countries. But it has long seen Sudan as a conduit for weapons smuggled to the Hamas-ruled Gaza strip via the Egyptian Sinai desert. Sudan’s information minister, Ahmed Bilal Osman, said: ‘The sophisticated warplanes and weapons used in the attack are available to no country in the region except Israel.’ Graphic with details of a raid carried out a military complex in Khartoum . He added that Sudan would have to take ‘decisive steps’ in retaliation although this would ‘definitely’ not entail a direct strike. ‘But we have the means, we have the means of how we can reply. They killed our people... and we know how to retaliate.’ There was widespread condemnation in the Arab world yesterday over the alleged attacks, although there was no direct proof linking them to Israel. Western ‘security sources’ told the Sunday Times the bombing raid was carried out by eight Israeli F-151 planes.","Sudan vowed to take 'decisive steps' in retaliation against Israeli interests .

"Is this the best bathtub in Berlin? Soaking in both the bubbles and the views through floor to ceiling glass from 118metres above ground level, there's really no need to ever leave the tub, if you don't mind a little pruning skin. I may not have been a guest in the Presidential Suite during my stay at the Waldorf Astoria, but I did climb into the en suite bathtub fully clothed during a clandestine sneak peek, just to see how the other half bathe, and yes, I feel I would be right at home here. Soak in the views: The Presidential Suite en suite bathtub has panoramic views of the city from its floor-to-ceiling windows . Wake up in the sky: The palatial 260-square metre suite enjoys panoramic views from all walls . With two palatial bathrooms off of two enormous bedrooms adjoined by a chic lounge and dining room complete with grand piano and floor-to-ceiling windows with spectacular views throughout, it is little surprise that the suite enjoys an impressive occupancy rate - despite a nightly charge of £4,160. Down in the elevator a few floors is where my King Tower Suite is located. The suites manage to be contemporary and practical, sleek and elegant, and plush with designer touches to please every guest from business travellers to discerning holiday makers. Features include a full size lounge with adjoining kitchenette, marble bathroom with a walk-in shower room and TVs hidden in the mirrors, and a pillow menu that includes non-allergenic, feather, wedge shape, cherry stone and horse hair... but what really wowed me about the suite was the views. Room for a few: The other en suite is just as jaw-dropping, with a glittering bath and adjacent balcony . Elegance: The features every luxury including a grand piano, fire place and separate kitchenette . The Tower Suites occupy the upper floors of the landmark Waldorf Astoria skyscraper, rising 32 floors above the city, its tower of windows glittering in the sunlight. This wall of uninterrupted glass translates to floor-to-ceiling windows in the suites, offering panoramic 180 degree views from north-west to south-east in my corner room. I overlook Tiergarten, a field of green trees stretching away into the distance, speckled with red and brown as Autumn spreads. The zoo is immediately below, and I am treated to views of the monkeys, giraffe and elephant waking up with my morning coffee. Luxury: Rooms in the 118 metre tower boast panoramic 180 degree views . Iconic: Vistas across the Tiergarten and Berlin Zoo to the landmark Fernsehturm TV tower . Decadent: The Lang Bar harks back to a more glamorous era - order the Tea N'T, you won't regret it . From one wall of windows I overlook Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in its Romanesque Revival splendour. To the north-east, I can see the iconic Fernsehturm TV tower in the distance. The only drawback to the panoramic vista is the eyesore Bayer building to the with its revolving logo which deserves a rusty nail. The Tower Suites have their own separate entrance and lifts, which emerge just outside the famed Peacock Alley - a distinctive feature of all Waldorf Astoria properties that originated from the connecting corridor between the original adjacent Waldorf and Astoria hotels in New York when they were joined together by the formerly feuding Astor family members who owned them, William Waldorf Astor and John Jacob Astor IV. With its long and illustrious history dating back to 1893, the Waldorf Astoria has come to be synonymous with luxury and elegance, as well as superior service.

Landmark: The skyscraping Waldorf Astoria stands out with its impressive tower of windows . Service in Les Solistes by Pierre Gagnaire is a carefully orchestrated performance, as the renowned chef's food is a work of art on the plate. It is plain to see why the Michelin-starred Gagnaire is nicknamed 'the Picasso of French cuisine.' The service throughout the hotel is wonderful, the suites are sublime and the views unparalleled. But what I'm really here for is the 'taste' of Waldorf. While most are aware that the Waldorf salad was created at the brand's New York flagship (the name gives it away) few know that it is just one of its iconic contributions to the culinary world. TASTE OF WALDORF . Eggs Benedict, Thousand Island Dressing and even Red Velvet Cake are all said to have been invented by Waldorf chefs. Keen to continue this proud tradition, Waldorf Astoria have announced the Taste of Waldorf in in partnership with James Beard Foundation. Five renowned Waldorf chefs are teaming up with five rising star chefs at their hotels in Rome, Berlin, Edinburgh, Shanghai, and La Quinta, California.

"It was the first foreign Soviet nuclear base, built in Germany three years before the Cuban missile crises and ready for an attack on Western Europe. Soviet nuclear missiles 20 times more powerful than Hiroshima were set . up here, primed to be fired at targets including London and nuclear . bases in eastern England. But since it was built in 1959 in the picturesque woods of Brandenburg, Vogelsang has become an eerie ghost town, reclaimed by nature. Ready for attack: Bunkers covered in sand for missiles and hardened concrete bunkers for warheads lay in the camp . Primed: A rocket launcher able to fire at targets up to 1,200km (750 miles) away was also on site . Reclaimed: The base has been largely overtaken by nature . There was once a garrison town for 15,000 people in this wood in what was then East Germany, with a theatre, shops, offices, a gym and a school. But the camp was extremely well hidden, concealed from spy planes and prying eyes by birch trees. An obelisk which bares the silhouette of Lenin still stands and peeling murals featuring brightly coloured paintings of swans flying and a sailing ship remain at the school. The upright figure of Lenin, and a mural of Red Army tanks in action, are also featured on the wall outside. Bunkers covered in sand for missiles and hardened concrete bunkers for warheads lie elsewhere on the camp, once ready for attack. Well hidden: The camp was concealed from spy planes and prying eyes by birch trees . Leader: An obelisk featuring the silhouette of Lenin . Faded remains: A mural of Red Army tanks in action, are also featured on the wall outside . An area which was once the site where weapons of mass destruction would have been launched, is now nothing more than a beautiful clearing amidst the trees. This idyllic glade features a concrete platform, on which there is a metal plate for the rocket . launcher able to fire at targets up to 1,200km (750 . miles) away, and which could have easily reached London, which lies just 1,000km away. It is almost impossible to see the sky from the glade, which means it would also have been barely visible to the prying spy planes of the 1960s. According to secret American intelligence reports released since the end of the Cold War, the base was set up in 1959, the BBC reports. In Cuba, aerial photographs used as evidence were clear and after two weeks of tension, the Soviet Union backed down and agreed to remove the weapons. But the rocket base in Germany was far less visible. Secret CIA reports dated  August 11, 1960, and entitled 'Possible Shyster Missile Base in East Germany'  piece together the puzzle of where the base could be. Eerie reminder: Brightly coloured murals featuring swans and ships remain on the walls of the camp's school . Abandoned: The camp was left in 1994 when the Red Army removed anything that they could from the base . First foreign base: The camp was designed to target the west . The glade features a concrete platform on which there is a metal plate for the rocket launcher . The Americans knew there was a new missile and trailer system in use because it had been shown to the Politburo and cameras on May Day in 1957 and 1960. They also knew the Soviet Union was too distant for it to reach prime Western targets. Details which appear to have come from Western agents in East Germany who observed what was going on around them on the railways and roads between Poland and East Germany helped to piece together the puzzle. CIA reports reveal that agents had seen 'a very slow moving column of Soviet military vehicles'  heading from the 'direction in which the Jueterbog-Damm airfield and a railroad loading ramp are located in a northwesterly direction along the western outskirts of Jueterbog.' A few months later, another observation noted: 'A group of eight trailers probably identical to the Shyster parade trailer, based on analysis of available photography, was observed entering East Germany by rail at Frankfurt-Oder, on 9 September, 1959.' Special military train shipments, suspected of carrying unidentified Soviet missiles and related equipment were also seen at several other locations in East Germany during 1959. From all of the clues, the CIA concluded the camp in the forest north of Berlin was going to be used for mobile launchers of nuclear weapons. Hidden: A bunker at the base concealed by mountains of sand . Overgrown: Although the buildings, including shops, a school and a theatre still remain, they are gradually being overtaken by nature . A later CIA account told a story of the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, asking a military designer how many nuclear missiles it would take to destroy Britain and France. Those missiles would have been fired from this camp. The missiles deployed in East Germany in spring 1959, were withdrawn later in the year. However, unaware, the CIA, was still concerned about their presence in the country in early 1961. Loughborough University's Dr Paul Maddrell, an expert on Western intelligence operations in East Germany, told the BBC Khrushchev deployed the weapons as part of a policy of 'nuclear blackmail.' He said: 'He threatened in 1956, at the time of the Suez Crisis, to use nuclear weapons, and he very much regarded his threat as successful, so he saw nuclear blackmail as a valuable policy initiative and he needed, therefore, the nuclear missiles to back that up.' According to secret American intelligence reports, the base was set up in 1959 . Maddrell said he believed they were withdrawn in connection with Khrushchev's demand in November 1958 that Western countries should leave West Berlin. As Nato announced plans to defend West Berlin and to cross East German territory the threat of a full-scale war looked imminent. For years after Vogelsang was the headquarters of the Soviet Union's 25th Tank Division, the third biggest Soviet military base in East Germany.","Concealed by birch trees and amidst dense woodland, Vogelsang was the first foreign Soviet nuclear base .

"The British lover of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, 40, has found herself the target of heavy abuse online after news of her affair with the married multi-billionaire emerged. Amanda Rosenberg, 27, who attended one of the UK's most exclusive schools with Kate Middleton has been accused of 'sleeping her way to the top' and of destroying Brin's marriage of six years to Anne Wojcicki. Google has been rocked by talk of the romance, and a spokesman confirmed this weekend that Brin – one of the world’s richest men with a $22 billion fortune - has been living apart from his wife and mother of his two children. A good looking girl... 'who knows she is': Miss . Rosenberg, shown left wearing the Google Glass device and right in a . picture from her Google+ profile, previously dated Ewan Butler, . 28, a trainee teacher living in the UK . Abuse: Amanda Rosenberg has come under attack on her Google + profile for her alleged affair with the internet giants co-founder, Sergey Brin . The abuse has been posted to Rosenberg's Google + account, with one individual known as Bill Kowba commenting on a picture, 'Was this photo taken before or after you slept with a married man and destroyed his marriage.?' Another irate person, under the handle Jan Vries, wrote, 'You are such a soulless person. No morality. Ruining a man's life. Think of his two children...Shame on you.' However, the abuse was not totally one sided, with others standing up for her. 'Do you have nothing better to do than write nasty comments to this girl?' someone else wrote, under the handle holdengirl02 1. If they divorce, Californian law suggests their . massive fortune would have to be halved – although they reportedly . signed a strict pre-nuptial agreement. While the internet was agog . with talk of Brin romancing his much younger employee, the Daily Mail . tracked down a distinctly unsurprised former boyfriend of Miss Rosenberg . – who said she ‘knew the power of her womanly ways’. Attacks: Ellie Poole said that she was disappointed with Rosenberg and accused her of sleeping her way to the top . Ewan Butler, . 28, a trainee teacher living with his parents in Darlington, said: . ‘Amanda’s a good looking girl, and she knows she is. 'And she’s good at . “playing” men – she played me.’ Brin’s relationship with Rosenberg . emerged only yesterday – but the pair were pictured together earlier . this year at a New York Fashion Week event, both wearing the . controversial Google Glass computerised spectacles for which she is . marketing manager.

Head Gear: Amanda Rosenberg is pictured here in an image from her Google + account - which came under attack from those upset at her alleged affair with Google co-founder, Sergey Brin . Miss Rosenberg wrote an . online blog soon after she arrived – describing herself as a . ‘misanthropic Brit struggling to come to terms with Californian . optimism’. She wrote: ‘I’d been living a beautifully choreographed . life in London for pretty much my entire life; family, friends, job, . life. Then one day I realized the beauty had faded. ‘So I applied for a transfer with my company to a different country. Yes! The romance of a transfer! ‘Luckily for me this all worked out like I dreamed it would...NOT. Of course it didn’t work out like that! ‘I . remember having conversations with people about moving countries, and . no one talks about how it felt to be alone. 'I wanted to grab them and . scream “Why are you not telling me about how you ate lunch in the . toilets at work for the first week because no one talked to you?”.’ Employee: Miss Rosenberg pictured in a YouTube marketing video for Google Glass. She won her role promoting the controversial spectacles after coming up with the voice command ‘Ok, Glass’ to . activate them . Connected but no longer together: Brin and his estranged wife are bound together by business dealings - he is an investor in her DNA company 23andMe - and the children they share. Glasses promotion: Rosenberg with boss Brin and fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg in New York .

"Annette Malocco, from the West Midlands, had the pioneering operation two weeks ago . It sounds like a scene from a horror movie. As almost every drop of blood was drained from Annette Malocco’s body, for 20 minutes she ‘died’ on the operating table at Papworth Hospital. Yet surgeons were saving her life. Annette was undergoing a pulmonary endarterectomy, a pioneering operation which put her into a corpse-like state as a heart-lung machine took over the work of these vital organs and her blood was removed. Although her brain continued to function normally, with no oxygenated blood being circulated in her body, surgeons had just 20 minutes to remove clots from her lungs that were severely affecting her ability to breathe, before her organs would begin to shut down. Thankfully, the procedure was a success, and less than a week later the 40-year-old housewife was on her way home. While the seven-hour operation might seem like the stuff of nightmares, Annette admits she had few nerves as she became one of the 160 patients who undergo the surgery each year at Papworth. The hospital in Cambridgeshire is one of only four centres in the world, and the only one in the UK, able to carry out the highly complex procedure. Her operation features in an episode of the BBC documentary series Trust Me I’m A Doctor later this month. Annette, of Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, had her surgery just two weeks ago. She first began having problems in June last year when she had trouble breathing while walking her dogs. ‘I’m asthmatic so I initially put it down to that and thought my inhaler wasn’t working properly,’ she says. ‘But within months I found I couldn’t walk across the living room without being breathless, and then I began to get chest and shoulder pains as well.’ An X-ray revealed that Annette had blood clots in her lungs. She was suffering from chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) – blockages in the blood vessels to the lungs as a result of scar tissue. The body naturally dissolves blood clots but in rare cases they become fibrous, block the arteries and prevent normal blood flow. Annette was referred to Papworth and consultant cardiothoracic surgeon David Jenkins had to determine if she would benefit from the operation. When they decided she was a suitable candidate, Annette was undaunted. ‘My quality of life had gone. I’d got to the stage where I thought, “What is the point?” I was existing, not living, so I jumped at the chance of surgery,’ she says. Surgeons perform a pulmonary endarterectomy at Papworth Hospital - which involves putting the patient into a corpse-like state as a heart-lung machine takes over the work of these vital organs . First, the patient is connected to a heart-lung bypass machine that diverts the circulation. The same machine is used to cool the body from 37C to 20C to prevent damage to vital organs. This also reduces the blood circulation so that for about 20 minutes there is no blood in the body at all. The heart stops beating, meaning the body is effectively lifeless. Five litres of blood a minute are usually pumped into the pulmonary arteries, which is why it is vital that there is no blood to obstruct the surgeons’ view as they open the blood vessels and then remove the artery lining to clear the clots. Once this has been done, the patient is warmed up to a normal body temperature and taken off the bypass machine, a process that can take two hours. The hospital in Cambridgeshire is one of only four centres in the world, and the only one in the UK, able to carry out the highly complex procedure . Mr Jenkins says: ‘To anyone watching the operation, the patient has flatlined, nothing is working, there is no blood going to the brain. They are put into a suspended state called deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. ‘We did a complex trial at Papworth and discovered that after this operation, patients’ cognitive skills were not impaired – in fact in many cases they improved.’ The condition affects both men and women, and Mr Jenkins has operated on sufferers aged between 14 and 89. Patients usually spend at least two days in intensive care but generally return home after two weeks. They must take blood-thinning drugs for the rest of their life to prevent further clots. ‘I feel as if I’ve been given a new lease of life,’ Annette says. ‘Within days of the operation I could breathe properly and without pain. I’m having a bit of physiotherapy to help with the healing where the surgeons made an incision in my sternum, but apart from that I feel amazing.

Ask a stupid question . Do some people never cry? Dr Adam Perkins, lecturer in the neurobiology of personality at The Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King’s College London, says: ‘Our emotional reactions are influenced by two structures near the base of our brain known as the amygdala. 'Damage to this area causes impaired emotional reactions. However, there is naturally variance in amygdalar reactivity between individuals.

"The days of awkwardly trying to get everyone in the frame of a video might be over. A team of former Apple engineers have developed an interactive panoramic camera. It can be held in the palm of your hand and it records everything around it, through a total of 360°. Scroll down for interactive video demonstrating the technology . The Centr camera (pictured) is a small device that can generate 360-degree HD video in real-time. The device was created by a team of former Apple engineers and has been used by the US military . Dubbed the Centr Camera, the team are currently looking for funding on Kickstarter. It is touted as a new way to capture videos of the world around you. And its innovative design ensures you’ll get uninterrupted footage. ‘Centr allows you to capture your experiences and share them in a whole new way,’ the company writes on Kickstarter. ‘Capture 360° video in real-time on a camera that fits in the palm of your hand. ‘With decades of experience working on cameras at Apple, the Centr team knows what it takes to bring beautiful design and groundbreaking technology together in one product.’ The device has four HD cameras fitted to it, which are embedded in a ring design. A hole in the middle lets you easily hold the camera while keeping the view of the cameras unobstructed. The camera can also be placed on top of Centr’s dual-use mount. As you take footage software within the camera converts what the four cameras see into a single interactive video. Using Centr's software, you can then move and zoom around the video when you play it back. It has a whole host of applications, such as watching different parts of the action at sporting events or capturing moments with all of your friends in the shot. On batteries or the supplied battery pack it can shoot HD video for about 2 hours, or it can be used to take photos for five hours. The camera is compatible with an official app on iOS, with an Android app also in the works. The Centr camera allows you to get new views when taking video. As the video plays you can scroll and zoom around it with your mouse of finger, depending on what device you are using. The team are currently looking for funding on Kickstarter . Centr uses four HD cameras to capture footage, which is then stitched together by software into an interactive panoramic video. You can also record out of each camera individually if you don't want to shoot in 360-degrees . Four HD cameras are positioned around the ring. These each capture footage at 60fps with a 4K panoramic video resolution. Software in the camera stitches together the footage from each camera into a 360° video. The videos are interactive, so you can move and zoom around while watching them. Each can be viewed on a computer, smartphone or tablet in real-time via Wi-Fi with Centr’s interactive player. If you don’t want to shoot in 360° you can individually select one of the cameras. Centr can also take 20 megapixel time-lapse panoramic photos. The product seems to be a competitor with other ‘on-the-go’ cameras such as GoPro’s devices. But Centr is the first to provide 360-degree capability. Their device has already attracted the attention of several companies including Fox and ESPN. It has also been picked up by the US Department of Defense, who have used the Centr camera in tandem with forward-looking infrared (FLIR) technology. In place of regular cameras, the battlefield version uses four FLIR camera on top of soldiers’ helmets to record what’s going on around them in infrared. This data can then be used by drones flying overhead to locate targets. And Centr say there could be many other applications for their camera. It will go on sale to the public in February 2015, with a retail price of $399 (£235).","US company has unveiled the Centr camera that shoots all around you .

"A Texas mother who buried her infant son alive has been convicted of capital murder - despite her lawyer's arguments that she is mentally ill. Narjes Modarresi, 32, was sentenced to life in prison Thursday for the April 2010 murder of two-month-old Masih Golabbakhsh. A jury in Houston, Texas, returned a guilty verdict after deliberating for two hours. Prosecutor Sunni Mitchell told jurors that Modarresi never formed a bond with little Masih - a baby 'she never wanted and never loved.' Narjes Modarresi, 32, showed no emotion as she was convicted of capital murder on Thursday. She is pictured here during the opening of the trial earlier this month . Narjes Modarresi, 32, (right) was sentenced to life in prison for the April 2010 murder of two-month-old Masih Golabbakhsh (left) Modarresi, an Iranian immigrant, showed no expression in court as she was found guilty - and again a short time later when District Judge Maria Jackson sentenced her to life in prison. Her lawyers had argued for the jury to convict her of the lesser charge of felony murder - saying she suffered from depression and bi-polar disorder. Even the baby's father asked for leniency. 'If she is really sick and everything, which I think she is, she should not spend her life in prison and forever,' Amir Golabbakhsh told KHOU-TV. Prosecutors argue Modarresi's actions were calculated - not the result of desperation due to mental illness. 'She woke up on April 21, 2010 and decided to kill Masih Golabbakhsh,' Assistant Harris County District Attorney Sunni Mitchell said in her opening statement either this month. 'He was a child she never wanted and never loved. He was in her way.' The baby was her second child. He died after being buried face down in the mud outside West Houston's Buffalo Bayou. Attorney George Parnham believes his client's mental state should be a mitigating factor in sentencing even if she is convicted . At first, she claimed two men in a beige Chevrolet kidnapped the boy while she walked him in a stroller. But according to the Houston Chronicle, a neighbor told prosecutors they say her run and crash the stroller, with no baby in it, into a curb on purpose. She then allegedly called 911 to report the child missing. After speaking to her neighbors, authorities finally confronted Modarresi who took them to the baby's grave. Parnham promised to convince jurors his client was unstable with evidence from psychological evaluations, records of two suicide attempts in her teens, and on psychotic episode on the flight home from her native Iran that forced the plane to perform an emergency landing in Qatar. Her mental health could be a mitigating factor in sentencing. If convicted of capital murder she will automatically be sentenced to life in prison. But if convicted of a lesser offense like murder, punishments could range from five years to life in prison.","Narjes Modarresi's lawyers argued for lesser charges because she suffers from depression and bi-polar disorder .

"Deaths from some of the most common cancers have dropped by a third in the last 20 years, the latest figures show. Rates of death caused by breast, bowel, lung and prostate cancer combined fell by 30 per cent overall, according to Cancer Research UK. These cancers account for almost half of the 160,000 cancer deaths in the UK each year. The charity says research, leading to innovative drugs and other forms of treatment, is responsible for more patients beating the disease. Cancer Research UK's latest study shows death rates from the most common forms of cancer have fallen . Earlier diagnosis has helped boost survival rates, but there have also been major advances in surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Death rates for breast cancer fell by 38 per cent, bowel cancer by 34 per cent, lung cancer by 27 per cent and prostate cancer by 21 per cent in 2010-2012 compared with 1991-1993. The data shows around 15,000 people died from breast cancer 20 years ago compared with 11,600 now. Scientists have improved detection of the disease through screening and more effective treatments - such as more effective forms of surgery and radiotherapy, along with hormonal drugs. Today almost 3,000 fewer people a year die from bowel cancer than 20 years ago, while recently introduced screening is likely to bring death rates down further through earlier diagnosis. But a fall of 3,000 lung cancer deaths over the last two decades has masked rising rates among women smokers. Prostate cancer survival in the UK has doubled in the last 40 years with half of those diagnosed with cancer living for at least 10 years. But some cancers have not made the same progress, with death rates in liver, pancreatic, melanoma, oral and some digestive cancers all increasing. Despite improvements, cancer survival rates in Britain still lag well behind those in other European countries. A major study of 29 countries found that the UK was on a par with Slovenia, Czech Republic and Estonia far below France, Germany and Scandinavia. Harpal Kumar, Cancer Research UK’s chief executive, said ‘Research continues to help save lives from cancer, and these figures offer renewed encouragement that progress continues. ‘The UK remains a world leader in cancer research, responsible for many of the breakthroughs that have reduced the impact of cancer. Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said Britain was a 'world leader' in cancer research . ‘But while the death rate for the four biggest cancer killers falls, it’s vital to remember that more needs to be done to help bring even better results over the coming years. ‘There are over 200 different forms of the disease. For some of these, the advances are less impressive, such as pancreatic, oesophageal and liver cancer. ‘Far too many lives continue to be affected by the disease. We’re determined that the research we fund will help save more lives, developing better, kinder treatments which will beat cancer sooner.’ Mother of two Nicola Bourne from Harpenden was just 31 when she was diagnosed with advanced bowel cancer in 2012. She had intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy to shrink the tumour, a 12 hour operation to remove it and then a further course of chemo finally finishing on Christmas Eve 2012. Nicola’s mother had died from bowel cancer three years earlier after enduring six years of gruelling treatment – which the young mother was dreading. ‘I expected the worst but almost everything about the treatment had changed’ she said. ‘You could just see how much it had improved from when I went through it with mum. While my mother had chemo in the hospital I could take a pill at home. ‘The difference in how cancer care and treatment had moved on in 10 years was phenomenal – thanks to research I’m incredibly optimistic that in another 10 years things will have got even better. ‘Soon after my mother was diagnosed, my grandmother realised she’d been having similar symptoms and she too was diagnosed with bowel cancer. ‘But unfortunately it was too late for treatment and she died aged 69. When I was referred for genetic counselling I discovered my great grandfather had died from the same thing making four generations affected by the same cancer.’","Death rates of some of the most common cancers have dropped by a third .

"An autistic man is campaigning to make the bullying of people with learning disabilities illegal. Kevin Healey, 38, a radio presenter for Autism Radio UK, wants to make bullying a prosecutable offence and already has the backing of a number of celebrities. Ricky Gervais has got behind Kevin's cause and said: 'Please support Kevin Healey’s campaign. Bullying has to stop.' Katie Price's 10-year-old son, Harvey, has learning disabilities, and has been the subject of internet trolling. She too is keen for laws to be changed. Ricky Gervais and Katie Price are just two of the celebrities who have . openly backed Kevin's campaign to make bullying those suffering with . learning disabilities illegal . She said: 'I support Kevin’s campaign for anti-autism bullying. So many people with autism get bullied. 'I do not want my son Harvey to grow up and be bullied and will not stand for it. Kevin is 38 and it’s disgraceful that ignorant and narrow minded people are bullying him and others. 'Kevin wants children and adults with learning difficulties to be better protected from bullying.' Current law means that if a mentally disabled person reports bullying or harassment, police log it as a 'hate crime' but are not obliged to follow-up the complaint - unless violence is threatened. They are also powerless to act against people who troll from outside the UK. Kevin wants police to be able to . prosecute the perpetrators for these hate crimes, even if they do not . physically hurt the person. Melanie Sykes and ex-TOWIE star Lydia Bright are also supporting Kevin's plight. Lydia said: 'A law needs to be put in place to stop these criminals' ‘People who are autistic like me take . things far more literally and become anxious much more easily than . most,’ he said. ‘Bullying behaviour such as taunting people in the street or sending offensive emails are distressing for everyone but it can affect those with . learning disabilities far more.’ Kevin, a radio presenter from Stoke-on-Trent, is autistic and wants people with special needs to be better protected from bullies . He has received backing for his campaign from numerous celebrities including Melanie Sykes, Luke Goss, Michael Barrymore and former TOWIE star Lydia Bright. Alongside the celebrity support, Simon Sugar, Sir Alan Sugar's son, is helping Kevin organise the campaign. Kevin, from Stoke-on-Trent, has been the victim of bullying since he was a child and continues to be cyber-bullied. Just 14 months ago he received a death threat via email. Because the troll emailed him from abroad, police were unable to follow up the case, saying they would only be able to take action if Kevin was actually hurt. Kevin was so frightened he did not leave his house for three months. After Kevin has managed to tighten laws . in the UK, he wants to drive change in international law, making death . threats from abroad a punishable offence. He has set up an online petition and if he gets 100,000 signatures, MPs will debate the possibility of amending existing British law in parliament. MP James Brokenshire is the Minister for . Security at the Home office. Kevin has been in touch with him to call . an urgent meeting about his campaign. Melanie Sykes has added her weight to the campaign and said: 'I support Kevin’s anti-bullying autism campaign. 'The UK laws must change to protect autistic people. It’s more than a hate crime and people who bully need to be prosecuted. Last month mother Liz Crowther, from Coventry, made headlines after . she contacted the police when Facebook trolls circulated pictures of her . daughter Heidi. The images had been stolen from the . Coventry and Rugby Down’s Syndrome Support group website, which Mrs . Crowther ran for five years until 2009. Heidi has Down's Syndrome and she found the offensive . tweets deeply distressing. Despite repeatedly reporting the trolls, the couple said Facebook made no direct contact with them. Mrs Crowther contacted the police but she was told that it was not a matter for officers. 'We need to protect people on the spectrum.  My eight year old son Valentino is on the spectrum, so this campaign holds a very poignant place in my heart. Please join the fight to create laws against bullying.' TOWIE's Lydia bright also said: 'I have never got my head around bullying. Why one individual would want  to create insecurities, suffering and pain to another person. 'Bullying somebody who suffers from autism is even more a mystery to me. Autistic people already face many hurdles in life without the added stress of bullying. A law needs to be put in place to stop these criminals.’ In 2007, Fiona Pilkington killed herself and her 18-year-old daughter Francecca Hardwick after years of bullying. The pair, who were repeatedly targeted by gangs of youths, were found in a layby a couple of miles from their home in Barwell, Leicestershire. An inquest into their deaths two years later heard police were contacted 33 times in 10 years about anti-social behaviour - but the family only received eight visits from officers. A jury returned verdicts of suicide and unlawful killing, and said the response of Leicestershire Police and two local councils had contributed to what happened. The papers stated: 'Fiona Pilkington was driven to take this tragic action by the stress and anxiety she was suffering as a result of on-going anti-social behaviour, harassment, victimisation and bullying.' Kevin says legal changes concerning the treatment of goths and punks in Manchester fill him with hope. Fiona Pilkington (left) was driven to kill herself and her 18-year-old daughter Francecca Hardwick (right) after police did not take her complaints about bullying seriously .

Photographs emerged this week of Wilshere, who is recovering from ankle surgery, holding a shisha pipe while on a night out with friends.

The England footballer spotted chatting up a mystery woman and smoking outside Dstrkt Club in London . Alexis Sanchez has been ruled out of Saturday's clash with Tottenham with a hamstring injury . And Wenger is said to be concerned after Wilshere, who has not played since injuring ankle ligaments in the home defeat by Manchester United in November, was caught in yet another compromising situation. The Arsenal manager will wait to hear the midfielder’s version of events before deciding on the level of punishment, but the club are understood to have taken a very dim view of the matter, particularly given Wilshere has previous. The 22-year-old, who could be fined, will be reminded of his responsibilities once again by Wenger after his latest misdemeanour. In the latest photo Wilshere can be seen holding a shisha pipe, though as of last night there was no confirmation that he had taken a puff. No doubt aware of the latest controversy surrounding him, Wilshere responded last night by posting on Instagram a video and pictures of him training, accompanied with the message: ‘Worry about your character not your reputation, because your character is who you are and your reputation is only what people who don’t know you think about you!’ Wilshere grimaces in pain following a challenge during the game against Manchester United at Old Trafford . The England international is treated on the pitch before being replaced at Old Trafford in November . News of Wilshere's smoking is bound to infuriate manager Arsene Wenger yet again . Shisha or hooka pipes are a way of smoking tobacco, usually mixed with fruit or molasses sugar, through a bowl and hose or tube . Despite the riposte, Wenger will be frustrated that he has to deal with yet another smoking-related controversy involving one of his players. Wilshere has been caught smoking on two other occasions and Wenger will again face awkward questions about his young midfielder during this morning’s pre-match press conference ahead of tomorrow’s clash against Tottenham. Gunners keeper Wojciech Szczesny was fined by the club for smoking in the showers following the defeat by Southampton on New Year’s Day. On a positive note Wilshere will return to full training next week after his two-month spell on the sidelines. However there was more concerning news regarding Sanchez, who will miss the trip to White Hart Lane with a hamstring injury, as will Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who has a groin problem. It was hoped Sanchez would be available to face Mauricio Pochettino’s side after missing last weekend’s 5-0 win over Aston Villa. Danny Welbeck will return to the squad after recovering from a thigh injury. Wenger confirmed: ‘Alexis is not ready. He is not far away, the Leicester game (on Tuesday) is a possibility. He is of course very difficult to keep quiet. He is training but it’s light training. ‘Jack is back in full training next week, hopefully from Sunday.’ Wilshere (2nd left) was pictured in training last week as he battles back from his ankle injury .

"A photographer's exploration of her own insecurities, ideals of beauty and love and intimacy in the form of a series of self-portraits taken over 11 years eventually inspired her to lose 110lb. The photographs Jen Davis began taking of herself in 2002 have been gathered in a new book, 11 Years, which shows her journey in the form of deeply intimate self-portraits. The images will also go on show at the ClampArt gallery in New York City from Thursday. It was after her series had received critical acclaim and had been showcased around the world in 2011 that Davis realized that her body had not really changed over the years - and neither had she. Raw: Davis's self-portraits explore themes intimacy, love, insecurity and loneliness . Accomplished artist: 'A lot of artists use self-portraits to transform into other identities. But my intention was to understand myself better. To articulate myself through the lens,' Davis told Oprah magazine in 2012 . Intimate: Davis shot photographs of herself during her daily life . 'In ten years, my body hadn't really changed, and I hadn't changed, either,' she told Oprah magazine in 2012 following her surgery. 'The problem was that I was making myself vulnerable only for the camera. What I really wanted was to be vulnerable for another person.' Davis's first shot was taken when she was an undergraduate at Columbia College in Chicago during spring break. A clearly uncomfortable Davis sits on a towel on the beach, wearing shots and a top over her swimsuit as friends around her sun themselves in skimpy swimwear. 'I had never really photographed myself but that beach shot made me realize that I had to step in front of the camera,' Davis told the New York Daily News. 'I need to look at myself.' Posed: Davis took pictures of herself enacting everyday activities and also images such as this one, 'Fantasy' with male models . Change: Davis's portrait series was lauded but she realized when looking at them in 2011 that she hadn't changed since she began the series and decided to change her body . Bold: Davis says that if she'd known her work would be exhibited so extensively she doubts she would have been so open with her self-portraits . The portraits, raw and void of any pretension, are scenes from Davis's everyday life. In one, she sits on her bed and stares square at the camera, as if trying to look into her own soul. As the book progresses, Davis introduces male subjects into her self-portraits. She was craving intimacy, she says, but found it only in a camera lens. She explains, 'In the work what I kept returning to is: What is love? Am I loveable? Can someone find me attractive?' After her revelation in 2011, Davis underwent lap-band surgery and rapidly lost 110lb. Societal ideals: Eating in public is often a cause of anxiety for overweight people . Artist: 'I couldn¿t necessarily identify with the idea of someone seeing me as ¿beautiful,¿ but I could accept that the pictures that I created and inhabited were,' Davis says . Body of work: Davis has published her powerful series in a book called 11 Years . At 34 in . 2012 and drastically slimmer, Davis had never had a boyfriend. She . resumed her self-portraits, even though she felt more exposed than ever . before. She felt more beautiful and desirable too - but her subject was matter new and different. 11 Years marks the end of one chapter and the start of a new one in Davis's life, complete with its own joys and challenges. 'My . sexuality feels tangible for the first time. There's a change in tone. Where I once saw an overpowering sadness, I now see confidence,' says . Davis. Nothing to hide behind: Davis's weight began to melt away after her lap-band surgery . New chapter: The body she had photographed for so many years changed right before her lens .

"Happier times: Marilyn Dershowitz with her husband Nathan. Mrs Dershowitz died Saturday after being hit by a mail truck . Marilyn Dershowitz, 68, died Saturday after being hit by a mail truck in New York City during an afternoon bike ride with her husband. Mrs Dershowitz was the sister-in-law of celebrity lawyer, author and long-time Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz. Mrs Dershowitz was hit by a United States Postal Service truck on West 29th St. near Ninth Avenue in the Chelsea neighbourhood just . after 12 p.m., sending her crashing to the pavement, the New York Daily News reported. Bleeding badly from the head, the wounded bike rider was rushed to Bellevue Medical Center, where she died shortly after, reports the paper. Nathan Dershowitz, 71, was riding his bike just paces ahead of his wife. Mr Dershowitz told the Daily News: 'She stopped at a light and I went on ahead. A block later I stopped and turned around, and I saw the . lights from the police cars'. Mr Dershowitz raced back to the scene, where he saw his wife bleeding. He later told the New York Post: 'Bellevue spent nearly an hour on her, with 20 physicians trying to resuscitate her'. Investigators told the Daily News they believe Mrs Dershowitz was pedalling her silver mountain bike west with the traffic on 29th St. when she was hit by a mid-sized postal vehicle. Mr Dershowitz told the paper: 'The cars behind me said two cars tried to make it through the light, and neither wanted to give, and she was caught between a car and a truck'. The truck drove off immediately, but investigators said they didn't think the driver knew he had even struck the woman. Police reportedly found the postal worker later and questioned him. They added that the accident was captured on surveillance video. Broken bikes: Marilyn Dershowitz was killed while riding her bike in New York City Saturday . Police survey the scene where Marilyn Dershowitz was fatally struck by a mail truck . Scene: Police investigate the fatal accident of Marilyn Dershowitz in the Chelsea neighbourhood of Manhattan . Famous brother-in-law: Celebrity lawyer and bestselling author Alan Dershowitz is the brother-in-law of Marilyn Dershowitz . Mr Dershowitz said he and his wife were headed to the West Side bike path. He said: 'We're rarely in the city on weekends, and we had all kinds of nice things planned. 'I bought tickets for a boat ride up the Hudson to see the 4th of July fireworks'. It is not known if Mrs Dershowitz was wearing a helmet. Mr and Mrs Dershowitz had two grown children and three grandchildren, and they lived in the Tudor City complex on the far east side of Manhattan. Mrs Dershowitz was a retired Manhattan Supreme Court Special Referee (a judge) and her husband is a criminal defence lawyer. During her time in the Civil Branch of the New York State Supreme Court, Mrs Dershowitz oversaw a number of high-profile divorce trials, including the 2006 case of Dr. Nicholas Bartha, who blew up his upper East Side home rather than turn it over to his wife. Mr Dershowitz told the Post: 'She retired just six months ago so that we could do some enjoying . life'. The couple were reportedly planning on spending a few weeks . with their grandchildren, who live in the area. 'She was looking forward to that', said Mr Dershowitz. Mrs Dershowitz's brother-in-law, Alan Dershowitz, has served as a high-profile lawyer for O.J. Simpson, Mike Tyson, Patty Hearst, and Jim Bakker. In 1984, he convinced a court to overturn the sensational conviction of British socialite Claus von Bülow for the attempted murder of his wife, Sunny.

"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange could remain holed up inside Ecuador’s embassy in London for a year as he believes the case against him in Sweden will be dropped. The 41-year-old Australian, who faces arrest and extradition over alleged sexual offences if he sets foot outside the building in Knightsbridge, insisted that he believes that he will walk out a free man. In a TV interview broadcast in Ecuador, Assange said he believed it would take between 'six and 12 months' for the issue to be resolved. Scroll down to watch the interview . Pledge: Assange has sought political asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and says he believes it will take up to 12 months to resolve his situation . His comments follow Foreign Secretary William Hague’s admission that 'a solution is not in sight' to the row which has strained diplomatic relations with the South American country. Assange was granted asylum by Ecuador after seeking sanctuary in the country’s diplomatic mission in June. In an interview inside the embassy, he told Telesur he believed the issue 'will be solved through diplomacy', the BBC reported. Assange added: 'The Swedish government could drop the case. I think this is the most likely scenario. Maybe after a thorough investigation of what happened they could drop the case. 'I think this will be solved in between six and 12 months. That’s what I estimate.' Crowded: Hundreds of supporters, journalists and police officers filled the Knightsbridge street to listen to Assange speak earlier this month, and it appears he is there for the long haul . Ecuador has claimed that Britain threatened to storm its embassy after Foreign Official highlighted available powers to enter the building and make the arrest, an assertion strenuously denied by Mr Hague. The Foreign Secretary said yesterday: 'This may go on for a long time so we are not making a threat against the embassy of Ecuador.' While talks aimed at finding a way of ending the stand-off would continue, he added: 'Given Ecuador’s position on what they call diplomatic asylum and our very clear legal position, such a solution is not in sight at the moment.' It came just days after the Argentine ambassador in London accused the UK of violating international law in its 'arrogant' approach to the case of Julian Assange. Alicia Castro, who only took up her post earlier this year, said the diplomatic handling of attempts to extradite the Wikileaks founder showed similarities to the UK's attitude to the Falkland Islands. A former air stewardess and union official, Ms Castro is known for her nationalistic stance and is a close confidante of President Cristina Kirchner. Row: Castro likened Britain's policy on Assange to their diplomatic strategy over the Falkland Islands (pictured) Speaking of the Assange case in an interview with an Argentine radio station, she said: 'For us Argentines, this fact [sic], that shows us the arrogance of British diplomacy, does not surprise us. 'It is very similar to the approach taken toward the Malvinas Islands [the Argentine name for the Falklands]. London is being urged by the United Nations to negotiate and participate in dialogue with Argentina.' Ms Castro also revealed that she met . Assange at the embassy with other Latin American leaders last Friday . while listening to a live transmission from Washington of a meeting of . foreign ministers from the OAS to discuss the inviolability of embassy . and consular premises.","The WikiLeaks founder told a TV station that he still believes he will be able to walk out of the building a free man .

"Mr Quincey argued that a regular can of the drink - which contains 35g or six teaspoons of sugar - was similar in calories to 'a cappuccino or a half a croissant' The European president of Coca-Cola has admitted that some customers 'don't realise' how much sugar is in the company's drinks. Speaking on Newsnight, James Quincey also conceded that 'things need to change' and servings had to reduce in size. The admission came after Jeremy Paxman took him to task on the size of servings available in cinemas - some of which contain a staggering 44 teaspoons of sugar. When asked by Mr Paxman what good Coca-Cola did its consumers, Mr Quincey said: 'It does have some sugar in it... it has energy, but is it a necessity? No it's not. But millions of people enjoy it as part of their diet across the UK.' Mr Quincey also pointed put that a regular can of the drink - which contains 35g or six teaspoons of sugar - was similar in calories to 'a cappuccino or a half a croissant'. He stressed that the company was working hard to promote the calorie and sugar content of its products so that consumers could make informed choices. But when asked by Mr Paxman if he thought people had any idea how much sugar is in small and large servings of Coke at the cinema, he was forced to reply: 'I think maybe they don't', . He conceded: 'Things need to change and the bigger . cups need to come down,' he said. A 'small' cinema serving is said to contain a 23 teaspoons on sugar, while a large contains 44 - 'each to be consumed in a single sitting,' Mr Paxman added. Mr Quincey argued that the company wasn't trying to hide the information and was 'focused ongetting the information out there'. 'Then they can make choices and if they don't want to buy one... clearly [these sizes] won't be for everyone,' he added. But he agreed that the 'bigger cups need to come down' and there may be 'smaller packages'. 'I don't think we are saying that the . world can't change and doesn't need to move on - we do need to recognise . that things need to change,' he said. Supersize: A 'small' cinema serving is said to contain a 23 teaspoons on sugar, while a large contains 44 - 'each to be consumed in a single sitting,' Mr Paxman told Mr Quincey (right) UK guidelines recommend that ‘added’ sugars - those used to sweeten food, fizzy drinks, honeys, syrups and fruit juices - shouldn’t make up more than 10 per cent of the total energy we get from food. This is around 50g of sugar a day, equivalent to 10 cubes of sugar for adults and older children, and nine for five to ten-year-olds. But just one 500ml bottle of Coke will send you over this limit, with 10.5 cubes. Earlier this year Coca-Cola, the parent company of Sprite, announced that the fizzy lemon and lime flavoured drink was to be scrapped in favour of a lower-calorie version that uses a 'natural' sweetener, Stevia. The new formulation contains 30 per cent fewer calories. The drink was altered as part of Coca-Cola's . anti-obesity drive and followed a call by the government to address the . issue.

But just one 500ml bottle of Coke will send you over this limit, with 10.5 cubes . Coca-Cola also began airing anti-obesity TV ads this year to 'remind' viewers that all calories . count in managing weight, including those in Coca-Cola's products. Aside from Sprite, the company also said to be exploring more diet options. Diet drinks already make up nearly half of Coca-Cola's UK sales, with . Diet Coke and Coke Zero accounting for 45 per cent of sales. At the Sprite announcement the company said that since 2007, it had reduced the calorie . content of Fanta Orange by 30 per cent, Oasis by 35 per cent and Lilt by . 56 per cent.

"He should be focusing all his attention on tonight’s crucial match with arch-rivals Wales. But England rugby captain Chris Robshaw is clearly facing a few distractions at home as he prepares for the Six Nations championship opener at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. The 6ft 2in flanker’s girlfriend Camilla Kerslake welcomed him back from a hard day’s training with a roast chicken dinner, some slinky black lingerie and a very broad smile. Scroll down for video . England rugby captain Chris Robshaw's (right) partner Camilla Kerslake, 26 (left), posted a saucy image online of herself dressed in black lingerie and holding a roasted chicken. She said: 'Welcomed my man home like this' The opera singer accompanied her image with the caption: 'Welcomed my man home from camp like this tonight. Gotta feed him up for the first #6Nations test! #Rugby #Classical #roast #naughty #nighty #Dinner’ Then she posted the picture on Instagram and flagged it up by tweeting: ‘Welcomed my man home from camp like this tonight. Gotta feed him up for the first #6Nations test! #Rugby #Classical #roast #naughty #nighty #Dinner’ At least the 26-year-old soprano, born in London to a Welsh mother and New Zealander father, underlined the appropriate patriotism for such an occasion – by posing beside a Union Jack rug as she presented the feast to Robshaw, 28, her boyfriend of four years. However, the glamorous singer made no mention of what she was intending to dish up for pudding. Miss Kerslake’s cheeky curtain-raiser to this evening’s match provoked ribald responses from some of her friends and Twitter followers, one tweeting: ‘Blimey, Camilla, how can you expect the poor guy to concentrate on dinner when you’re dressed like that?! X’. Another warned: ‘Make sure he does not get an injury tonight!’ The multi-faceted Camilla, who recently starred in a raunchy opera, has performed in front of the Queen, sung in a pop band, won a string of classical music accolades, regularly sings the National Anthem at Twickenham and has recently been doing voice-overs for an opera-singing sheep in a film of the popular children’s animation Shaun the Sheep. She also finds time to be an accomplished cook. Her Facebook page includes a photograph of the beef wellington she prepared for a Kerslake and Robshaw family gathering – and it may be that roast chicken is a regular dish at home for the couple. The couple have been together for four years and rumours have been swirling that they may be engaged . Sam Warburton of Wales and England's Chris Robshaw pose during the launch of the 2015 RBS Six Nations . ‘Feeding a rugby player will bankrupt me,’ she said recently. ‘When I cook meals at home, Chris will chow down four chicken breasts and a barrel of rice.’ Tonight’s match at the Millennium Stadium has added spice because the two sides have been drawn in the same pool for the Rugby World Cup which takes place this autumn. Camilla is likely to be in the stands and her support could be very vocal. She recently tweeted about Andy Murray’s girlfriend’s infamous outburst at the Australian Open: ‘As someone in a similar position to #KimSears (though I don’t condone her language) the heat of the moment can get to you.’ The couple have been together for four years and there has been speculation that they may soon get engaged, or already have. But rumours were kicked into touch recently when he was reported as saying: 'I don’t have time for anything other than rugby.’","England rugby captain Chris Robshaw's partner posted saucy image online .

"POWERS OF TWO: THE ESSENCE OF INNOVATION IN CREATIVE PAIRS by Joshua Wolf Shenk (John Murray £20) Joshua Wolf Shenk has hit upon the interesting notion that creativity cannot occur in a vacuum. Even a proud, solitary genius such as Picasso was motivated and impelled by his rivalry with Braque and Matisse. William Wordsworth’s poems utilised ‘imagery and ideas’ from his sister Dorothy’s journals, and behind Vincent Van Gogh was his brother, Theo, his business manager and dealer. ‘They lost patience with each other. They made each other furious. But they also spurred and served each other.’ Theo, in his polished boots and pressed suit, has been eclipsed in history by the bohemian Vincent, a mess in his patched trousers — but, without the former man’s diligence, we’d not have had the other’s electric achievement. Eric Morecambe would have been a great actor if given the chance and was once offered a straight role. He was about to accept when Ernie Wise intervened and wouldn’t let him . Thus, in this fascinating study of ‘the intricate, intense interdependency between people’, the conclusion seems to be that ‘when we go back and forth, our ideas, our ambitions, our efficiency, our ability — everything gets bigger’. The more we overlap and collaborate, the larger we become, ‘much larger than we were as two individuals’. This can be true of authors, such as Scott Fitzgerald and Jeffrey Archer, who depend often on unacknowledged editors to shape ‘unwieldy manuscripts’. Politicians have speech-writers and aides behind the scenes, whether lowly MPs, or Gandhi and Martin Luther King. (Mrs Thatcher once said of Viscount Whitelaw: ‘Every prime minister needs a Willie’). Even famous politicians like Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King relied on their speech writers . Pop performers, in particular, are heavily dependent on producers, promoters and studio engineers. It is with famous double acts, however, that ‘an unmistakeable psychological union’ takes place, which goes down ‘to the bedrock of cognition’. Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, when formulating psychoanalysis, exchanged 337 letters, in which their handwriting and linguistic style merged. They could literally ‘finish each other’s sentences’, says Shenk. Bill Gates, of Microsoft, calls this the blissful state of being able to get on to a ‘high bandwidth’ with a soulmate: ‘wordless communication that observers commonly describe as telepathic’. C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien achieved this symbiosis. Meeting in a group called The Inklings to drink beer and discuss elves, they shared a love affair with Anglo-Saxon literature and Viking sagas. Out of this, Narnia and Hobbits were generated. When reading out pages of their manuscripts, ‘praise for good work was unstinted, but censure for bad work was often brutally frank’. Though based in a Paris, rather than an Oxford, inn, Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre were similar, ‘working in the same cafe at separate tables’. C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien achieved this symbiosis. Meeting in a group called The Inklings to drink beer and discuss elves, they shared a love affair with Anglo-Saxon literature and Viking sagas . With James Watson and Francis Crick, who together discovered the structure of DNA at Cambridge’s Cavendish Laboratory, the creative enterprise was seen to be selfless. These two filled gaps in each other’s knowledge and, ‘when one of us got on the wrong track, the other one got out of it’. They only fell out away from the lab, when Watson published an autobiography that Crick thought ‘a violation of friendship that grossly invaded my privacy’. The story is not as straight- forward as Shenk presents it. Crick and Watson were heavily reliant upon the research and innovations of Rosalind Franklin, who didn’t share the Nobel Prize with them only because she was a woman — a shameful episode. Lennon and McCartney had a voluble, prickly partnership from the start. Shenk writes brilliantly of the psychology behind The Beatles. Paul was meticulous and organised, John ‘seemed to live in chaos’. ‘He was constantly searching for scraps of paper he’d hurriedly scribbled ideas on . . . Paul was the diplomat, John the agitator’. They were so creatively and claustrophobically entangled, a split was inevitable — Yoko was John’s escape route. Lennon and McCartney had a voluble, prickly partnership from the start. Shenk writes brilliantly of the psychology behind The Beatles. Paul was meticulous and organised, John ‘seemed to live in chaos’. As Cynthia Lennon summed up: ‘John needed Paul’s attention to detail and persistence, Paul needed John’s anarchic, lateral thinking.’ The dependence, the proximity, can lead to resentment. Ballerina Suzanne Farrell became the muse of choreographer George Balanchine. They had a ‘silent understanding’, leading to great work on the New York stage. But ‘four times had Balanchine married his lead ballerinas’. he’d be inspired, drain them, move on — a real-life version of the vampire theme in The Red Shoes. To be a distinct pair yet only recognised as a unity can fester into hatred — as with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. Their comical slapstick fights became real, and they went from ‘rambunctious friends to wary enemies’, not speaking for years. Authors such as Jeffrey Archer depend often on editors to shape ‘unwieldy manuscripts’ Frank Sinatra reintroduced them, but it was as painful and awkward as former spouses meeting again decades hence. What Shenk calls ‘the essential dynamics between pairs’ is like an intense marriage, even if the partners are brothers. Orville and Wilbur Wright did nothing but squabble, but enjoyed the animosity. ‘I love to scrap with Orv. Orv is a good scrapper,’ said Wilbur. Vincent Van Gogh, however, couldn’t cope with the idea of Theo having any sort of existence beyond just the pair of them. It was when Theo announced his engagement that Vincent chopped his ear off. When Dudley Moore chose to move to Hollywood and break up his double act with Peter Cook, Cook told Mavis Nicholson it was ‘a divorce’, pure and simple. It had been a marriage of two minds; together and separate, side by side and neck and neck, the comedians had undertaken ‘parallel missions that intertwined’, the one man mutually reinforcing the invention of the other. Without such a structure, Cook drank himself to death. Shenk doesn’t, in fact, feature Cook and Moore, but a British version of his book ought to be commissioned, which could investigate the partnerships of Rolls and Royce, Marks and Spencer, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, Saatchi and Saatchi, the Two Ronnies, Welsh duo Ryan and Ronnie, Galton and Simpson, and Morecambe and Wise. Eric, for example, a great actor if given the chance, was once offered a straight role. He was about to accept when Ernie intervened and wouldn’t let him. I hate Little Ern for having the power to do that.","Joshua Wolf Shenk says creativity cannot occur in a vacuum .

"Floyd Mayweather Jnr insisted he remains in talks with Manny Pacquiao over their £200million mega-fight. An announcement about a May 2 bout in Las Vegas has been expected since the pair met in Pacquiao's Miami hotel suite last week. But with no news forthcoming about the fight, doubts had resurfaced over a clash that has been six years in the making. Floyd Mayweather posted picture of him in Manny Pacquiao's Miami hotel suite last week . Mayweather posted on selfie app Shots: 'I set up this meeting with Manny Pacquiao to get this fight done but they will continue to tell the public it's us (who are holding up the negotiations) and that's NOT TRUE.' The post was accompanied by a picture of him talking to Pacquiao althought it is unclear when it was taken. Mayweather and Pacquiao came face-to-face for the first time last week when they both attended a Miami Heat basketball match. They talked for over an hour later that night in a bid to thrash out a deal. The fighter (centre) was thought to have agreed a deal to fight Manny Pacquaio but talks have stalled . It was believed that the remaining issues involved the broadcast of the fight with Mayweather contracted to Showtime and Pacquiao to HBO.

"Tiger Woods suffered yet another setback in his long battle with injury as he was forced to withdraw from the Farmers Insurance Open in California on Thursday. Woods, who missed last year's Masters and the US Open after having surgery on a pinched nerve, managed only 11 holes in his first round at Torrey Pines before pulling out of the tournament. Tiger Woods leaves the course after withdrawing from the Farmers Insurance Open due to injury . Woods appeared to hurt his back after hitting his tee shot at the 12th on Thursday . The 14-time Major winner appeared to hurt his back after hitting his tee shot at the 12th - his third hole of the day - but carried on for eight more holes before calling it a day. Fog had led to a lengthy suspension of play before Woods teed off, and he said the disruption to his warm-up routine had caused the back problems to flare up. 'When we had that break I never loosened back up again and then when we went back out it got progressively tighter,' he said on Sky Sports 4. Woods speaks to reporters after withdrawing during the first round of the Farmers Insurance Open . Woods loads his golf clubs into the back of his car after withdrawing from the tournament . Former world No 1 cut a frustrated figure after his latest comeback from injury was cut short . Woods has withdrawn from three of his last nine starts and missed the cut three times . 'It's frustrating that it started shutting down like that. I was ready to go. I had a good warm-up session and then we stood out here getting cold and everything deactivated again. I just can't stay activated. That's the way it is.' Woods said this was the first time he has experienced such a situation as he tries to manage his comeback. 'Usually you don't have to wait like this,' he said. 'At home practising I keep going and keep going. This is different. 'My glutes (gluteus maximus muscles) are shutting off. If they don't activate it goes into the lower back. I tried to activate my glutes best I could but they didn't stay activated.' The 39-year-old former world No 1 was two-over-par when he withdrew, having double-bogeyed his final hole while also dropping shots at the 10th and 12th. He had chipped in for par on the second hole, but it was a rare highlight in another wayward outing. Woods' injury comes just six days after he recorded the worst round of his career when he shot an 11-over-par 82 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open. Woods was sidelined for much of 2014 after he underwent surgery in April and has suffered indifferent form ever since. The American finished 69th at the Open at Royal Liverpool in July, while a month later he missed just his fourth cut in 66 majors as a professional after suffering yet more back trouble at the US PGA Championship at Valhalla.

Woods made an underwhelming return to golf by shooting a five-over-par first round at the Hero World Challenge and it has gone from bad to worse in his first two tournaments of 2015. His withdrawal on Thursday was the ninth of his career to date.

"Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino believes he had to start from zero when he took over at White Hart Lane last May. The Tottenham coach also said Southampton manager Ronald Koeman has benefitted from the club he had left behind, and picked out Eden Hazard, Harry Kane and Bramall Lane when asked to choose a player from the Premier League, one from his own team, and the atmosphere at an English ground. Speaking on Catalan radio station RAC1, Pochettino was asked about the fortunes of Southampton who he left at the end of last season and Tottenham, who currently trail Koeman’s team in the Premier League. The Argentine coach said: ‘You have to say that they invested close to 80m euros in the summer and it was already a winning team on the up. When we arrived at Southampton in January of 2013 they had the team that had conceded the most goals in the league. Mauricio Pochettino (right) says that Ronald Koeman had a ready-made team when he joined Southampton . Pochettino left Southampton for Tottenham after taking them to eighth in the Premier League . 'It was a team with a lot of problems, with players like Adam Lallana who wasn’t playing and Luke Shaw who wasn’t playing but in one and a half years we turned it round. ‘We brought a lot of young players through and finished eighth. It is always easier taking over a winning team which is the case this time with Ronald [Koeman]. We came here and had to reinvent things. We always laugh about it because we left a team at Southampton that practically trained itself after a year and a half to come here where we had to recreate everything that we had done at Southampton, pretty much from zero, but it’s a great challenge.’ Spurs face Arsenal and Liverpool in their next two games and Pochettino admitted the Champions League was a huge ask. He said: ‘We are ambitious and we want to be in the Champions League but when you look at the other teams: Chelsea, City, Arsenal, Liverpool, United you realise that it is anything but easy. 'They are powerful clubs and you have United with the monstrous amount of money they spent last summer. We are going to try to compete against them because we are winners and everything is possible in football but the financial reality is that we are a long way from them.’ The Spurs boss (centre) claims that Bramall Lane has the best atmosphere he has experienced in England . He picked out his Spurs forward Harry Kane as being one of the standout performers of this season . Chelsea playmaker Eden Hazard (centre) was another name picking up praise from Spurs boss Pochettino . Pochettino picked out Chelsea’s Hazard as his stand-out player in the Premier League and Harry Kane from his Tottenham side. Asked if he felt he could hang on to the striker he said: ‘He has just signed a new deal and there are no buy-out clauses in England so whatever any club offers they will have to negotiate with the club. The player was born here and came through here and he wants to spend his career playing for this club.’ Asked about the best atmosphere he had experienced in his time in England Pochettino picked Bramall Lane. ‘They are a historic club currently in the third tier and for a Cup game there were 35,000 people in the stadium. So it’s that not Old Trafford, or Stamford Bridge or the Emirates that stands out,’ he told Primer Toc. The Barcelona-based broadcaster asked him for his opinion of the upcoming Champions League meeting between Manchester City and Barcelona and he said: ‘City are the most talented team in England but they are also inconsistent. You could say that Chelsea are more solid with less talent. City are always dangerous though and the game against Barcelona will be good to watch. Barcelona are not at the level they were under Guardiola so it’s 50/50.’","Ronald Koeman took over from Mauricio Pochettino as Southampton boss .

"Tim Sherwood has taken a step closer to being appointed Queens Park Rangers manager after Real Madrid coach Paul Clement ruled himself out of the running. However, an agreement over personal terms for Sherwood is still to be reached - though the ex-Tottenham manager is still understood to be on course to replace Harry Redknapp, who left Loftus Road earlier this week. Chairman Tony Fernandes, who still has to pay Redknapp the remaining six months of his contract, would prefer to offer his next boss a heavily-incentivised deal, which could yet be a stumbling block towards Sherwood’s appointment. Following Harry Redknapp's resignation, Tim Sherwood has emerged as the front-runner for the QPR job . 67-year-old Redknapp has left QPR, but will still be paid his contract until the end of the season . QPR owner Tony Fernandes would prefer to offer his new manager a heavily-incentivised deal . Real Madrid assistant coach Paul Clement has ruled himself out of the running for the job at Loftus Road . Fernandes has revealed he wants to to interview three candidates for the role; Sherwood, Clement and Steve McClaren. However, Derby manager McClaren has no interest in returning to QPR, where he spent a spell as a coach last season, instead committing his efforts to the Rams’ promotion push. And Clement has paved the way for Sherwood to take control after revealing he does not want the job either. ‘I’m very flattered to be linked with Queens Park Rangers, a club I supported as a young boy and for whom my Dad played,’ said Carlo Ancelott’s right-hand man. ‘It would be a real honour to manage that club at some point in the future. But, at this time, I’ve got no intention of leaving Real Madrid in mid-season.’ And unless there is a major twist, Sherwood, whose chances of landing the role improved significantly after close pal Les Ferdinand’s appointment as director of football, now looks en route for his first managerial job since being sacked by Tottenham in the summer.

"Totteham manager Mauricio Pochettino has urged supporters to stop booing Emmanuel Adebayor ahead of Saturday’s clash against Arsenal. The Togolese striker came close to leaving White Hart Lane on transfer deadline day but saw a loan move to West Ham thwarted by chairman Daniel Levy, while the forward rejected moves to Queens Park Rangers and Crystal Palace.

Yes, yes, yes,’ said the Argentine. ‘It’s important that the fans forget the past. And I think he explained why he made the comments. ‘And now, all together, we need to try to get the success. Because we are in a key moment. We need to put out the bad things, the bad energy, we need to try to help each other and try to get the success. ‘He is a long way towards recovering his confidence and his levels - and that is our job: to try to push him and help him and get him in the best condition to improve quickly.’ Pochettino insists it is time for fans to get behind their forward ahead of the game against Arsenal .

"Lewis Hamilton has landed back in London amid reports he is trying to salvage his relationship with Nicole Scherzinger. The Formula One world champion chartered a private jet to fly him from Spain, where he was testing at Circuito de Jerez, to England. His arrival comes after Scherzinger opened up that she still loves the Mercedes ace. Back in town: Lewis Hamilton arrives at a central London hotel after flying in from Spain to reportedly salvage his relationship with Nicole Scherzinger . Private jet: The Formula One champion chartered a plane to get him to London on Wednesday . Last ditch effort: Lewis had been testing his race cars in Spain but flew back for 'crisis talks' Hamilton, aged 30, wore a black hoody with a baseball cap as he headed into a central London on Wednesday night. MailOnline have contacted both Hamilton and Scherzinger's representatives for comment. Scherzinger admitted that she is 'devastated' when she called time on her long-term on/off romance with Hamilton. The former X Factor judge's split from Hamilton was revealed on Wednesday and speaking to The Sun's Dan Wootton, she said: 'I'm devastated that it didn't work out. It was the hardest decision we had to make, but we made it together.' Hamilton leaves his car after spinning out of control during day three of testing . The British driver waits by the side of his track while his Mercedes is recovered . Hamilton poses for a selfie with his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg (left)  in Jerez . However, she claimed that the two are still bound by love for each other, despite this being their fourth break-up. 'I love Lewis and I know he loves me,' she added. 'We wish nothing but happiness and the very best for one another. I'm trying to stay strong in my faith right now. Despite the apparent friendliness between the two stars, though, a source alleged to the paper that part of the reason for their latest split was due to a series of rows over the festive period. 'I love Lewis and I know he loves me': Nicole Scherzinger has given a heartbreaking post-split interview, in which she claims she and Lewis Hamilton are still very much in lov . Downcast: Nicole arrived for her performance in Cats at the London Palladium on Wednesday, after news of her break-up had broken . Low-profile: The former Pussycat Dolls star cut a glum figure as she made her way into the theatre . The 36-year-old singer parted ways from the British sports star, 30, due to the pressures of a long-distance relationship, causing the couple's seven-year  romance to come to an end once again. Despite making happy appearances together recently, it wasn't to be for the twosome who have tried time and time again to make their high-profile relationship work. And she hinted at the split in a relationship with the Daily Telegraph just last week, explaining: 'I have made sacrifices. I've left LA, left all my friends and my family. It's sacrificing your time in relationships, with loved ones...' Scherzinger and Hamilton are believed to have split because he wasn't ready for children, she told the Telegraph's Sarah Rainey that she sees herself as a mother within the next 10 years. Asked if she wants marriage and children in the next decade, she said: 'Oh yeah, I’ll definitely have that by then. I’ll definitely have that. Definitely, that would be nice…' Saddened: Lewis Hamilton was also notably downtrodden as he spotted at the Jerez racetrack in Jerez de la Frontera, Southern Spain on Wednesday . Difficult times: The 30-year-old Formula One driver has been in a seven-year long on-off romance with Nicole, and he failed to hide his sadness during training . Speaking about the break-up, a source close to the star told MailOnline on Wednesday: 'It was a mutual decision. The long distance kept them apart for long periods of time. 'They both spent most of their time alone because they were in different countries all the time. Nicole is heartbroken and devastated.' And as the talented star arrived at the Palladium to perform on-stage as Grizabella once again, Hamilton looked similarly downcast when he was spotted at the Jerez racetrack in Jerez de la Frontera, Southern Spain. Keeping his eyes shielded with sunglasses, he too appeared out of sorts and looked painfully heartbroken. Scherzinger - who is currently starring in the West End revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Cats at the London Palladium - primarily resides in Los Angeles, while Lewis is based in Monaco. Since the blow to her personal life, Nicole has been supported by her family, with her mother Rosemary and elderly grandmother flying to London from Hawaii to be by her side during this difficult time. Support: As recently as November, Nicole was in Abu Dhabi to cheer on her man as he won the world title . The talented former X Factor judge is now said to be throwing herself into her last few days on the stage in Cats, before heading back to Los Angeles next week. Speaking about the break-up, a source close to the star told MailOnline: 'It was a mutual decision. The long distance kept them apart for long periods of time. 'They both spent most of their time alone because they were in different countries all the time. Nicole is heartbroken and devastated.' The friend added: 'Nicole was really lifted by her family's visit. It was the first time her grandmother had been to visit her in London, and it couldn't have come at a better time. 'She's been throwing herself into work for the past few weeks and it's been a real tonic. They both care about each other deeply, and really wanted this to work out.' It's over: The couple initially met in 2007 and have split several times over the years, but a source thinks that love will bring them together once again . The couple originally went public with their relationship in 2007, but briefly split in January 2010 when they had been together for 20 months, before later reconciling. They then split again in late 2011, before giving their relationship another go in early 2012. But the beautiful twosome called time on things once again in July 2013, which prompted Nicole to break down in tears during her time on the X Factor judging panel. However, by February 2014 things were back on. But another source hasn't ruled out a reconciliation between the two. 'It's been seven years now, and it's always the same reason that splits them up,' the second insider said. 'Love always brings them back together.'","Formula One world champion chartered a private jet to fly him from Spain .

"His Honour Judge Hinkinbottom rejected the appeal . A failed asylum seeker and his 11-year-old daughter are demanding they must not be deported to France - because she would be banned from wearing the burka. The Muslim father, 42, says removing them from the UK and forcing them to live across the Channel would amount to a breach of her religious rights. France banned women from wearing the burka - the full body covering - and the niqab or face veil in public three years ago. The pair arrived in France when fleeing from Iran in 2011. Britain is seeking to deport them and under EU rules they should go to the first country they set foot in. The father, who cannot be named, said: ‘She loves to wear the burka. She already wears a burka during the weekdays, in the evenings and during the weekends. ‘She is very dedicated in following Islamic dress code and religious practices and values. ‘If we are deported to France she would not be able to follow her religious values and practices.’ He told the court he does not force her to wear the burka. The case has already been rejected by the High Court in June this year but the pair have appealed and the Court of Appeal is set to hear the case within months. The High Court of Justice in London . A woman wears a burka (picture posed by model) Rejecting that appeal, Mr Justice Hickinbottom said the girl only wore a burka occasionally in public - and that in France she could continue wearing it in public. The father, 42, who cannot be named for legal reasons, says the pair will face religious persecution and even imprisonment if his daughter wants to fully express her religious beliefs. He claims he was forced to flee Iran with his daughter disguised, using false passports, because of his political views. The family arrived in Britain from Iran after travelling to Turkey and then to France. He says he travelled by coach to Turkey with his daughter and then flew to France before landing at Luton airport in July 2011, where he claimed asylum. Their asylum bid was dismissed by the Home Office and passed to the French. He told immigration officials the girl would ‘suffer’ greatly in France because she wears the niqab. He said: ‘But what about my daughter’s school? She wears a cover but France won’t accept her at school. Mentally she will suffer a lot.’ After the Home Office rejected the asylum claim, immigration officers went to the family home in Derby, but father and daughter had vanished. The case was then heard by the High Court. Rejecting the case, Mr Justice Hickinbottom said: ‘Whilst I accept that she would at least at risk of prosecution under the 2010 law if she wore a burka in public in France, she does not wear the burka in public a great deal yet, she wears it occasionally. ‘In France she will be able to wear it in certain circumstances, at places of worship such as a mosque. ‘If she is prosecuted she will be able to take the human rights point to the European Court of Human Rights if necessary. He added: ‘Consequently, any potential affronty that the claimant or his daughter may potentially suffer to their dignity at the hands of the French state if they were removed there, would fall short of degrading treatment. ‘There is no evidence that those authorities are systematically unable or unwilling to address, determine and remedy any alleged breach. ‘Indeed, the evidence is quite to the contrary, namely that the French government and especially the French courts take their obligations in respect of human rights very seriously.’ In France women wearing a burka or niqab can be fined £125. Other countries in Europe, including Belgium, Italy and Holland also have restrictions on religious dress. Last month a British judge ruled that a woman could wear a full-face veil during her trial but must remove it while giving evidence. However, she will still be screened from the court and only visible to the judge, jury and prosecution and defence lawyers.","People seen to be wearing a burka or niquab can be fined £125 in France .

"RIATH AL-SAMARRAI: Jack Wilshere has huge potential and talent, but the Arsenal midfielder risks seeing his career go up in smoke . Jack Wilshere appeared to hit back at his critics after becoming embroiled in another smoking controversy. Photos of the midfielder holding a shisha pipe at a nightclub were posted on social media and quickly made national headlines. On Thursday evening, Wilshere posted on Instagram a video of himself in training as he recovers from ankle surgery along with the message: 'Worry about your character not your reputation, because your character is who you are and your reputation is only what people who don't know you think about you!'

The Gunners are to seek clarification from Wilshere over the circumstances of the incident, which is understood to have happened during a night out with friends in central London last week. A picture of Wilshere was uploaded to Instagram, before being removed and replaced with an edited version where only the face of the Arsenal player was visible in the background. However, the original image, where the England international held the shisha pipe, was then subsequently reposted on Twitter, sparking much debate across social media over the player's behaviour ahead of Saturday's north London derby at Tottenham.

Speaking in July after a previous incident, Wilshere said: 'The smoking? Of course I regret it. I have been seen before doing it. I said then I made a mistake and I have made a mistake again. People make mistakes. Jack Wilshere has once again made the headlines for the wrong reasons. When is he going to realise his place in the Arsenal team is under serious threat and start acting like a professional? Robert B, Fife . Surely it's time to start educating Jack and have somebody explain to him how to behave.

The goalkeeper has already lost his place over a smoking issue so you would never dream of being seen with anything – cigarette, shisha, lager, anything. Being in the team means so much to you and is such a reward for your efforts that it's not worth that risk. He is obviously going out and thinks he is in a private situation but you never are as a footballer, there is always somebody on the lookout. You have to be squeaky clean and if you are serious about your football that's how you should want to live anyway. CLICK HERE TO READ THE REST OF TACKLE KEOWN .

"Wales' Six Nations curtain-raiser with England is bound to be a bone-crushing affair to get the tournament started. While the match at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff is set to be a fast-paced tussle, fine details are likely to separate the two sides. Wales head coach Warren Gatland and his England counterpart Stuart Lancaster will have both devised a gameplan to win the game on Friday night. Here, Sportsmail assesses the crucial elements of where the match will be won or lost for either side. The midfield gain line - Stand up George Ford . Wales’ famous ‘Warrenball’ strategy is basically pretty simple. It’s based around power runners blasting holes in the opposition defence and forcing their way across the gain line to give the pack momentum. In Jamie Roberts and Jonathan Davies, Wales have a midfield with a combined weight of more than 33 stone who are capable of off-loading out of the tackle for supporting runners to surge forward. Wales will look to use the brute force of Jamie Roberts (centre) to create gaps in the England midfield . At just 13st 3lb, England fly-half George Ford is certain to be targeted by the Welsh centres while England centres Jonathan Joseph and Luther Burrell will need to ‘get in the faces’ of their opposite numbers in defence to stop Welsh attacks before they reach the gain line. Joseph is also the quickest of the four men and will look to exploit a weakness in Davies’ defence on the outside, which South Africa took advantage of ruthlessly last summer. England will hope centre Jonathan Joseph's speed will exploit a weakness in Jonathan Davies’ defence . The scrum - No excuses for England this time . The last time England visited the Millennium Stadium they were heavily penalised at the scrum by referee Steve Walsh and their game disintegrated without a set-piece platform. England were left incensed and frustrated by some of Walsh’s decisions. Friday night’s French referee Jerome Garces is renowned as an excellent referee of the scrum and England will have no excuses if they come off second best again. Picking Dan Cole at tighthead prop in place of the injured David Wilson following a six-week lay-off is a gamble by Stuart Lancaster but England will be hoping the experienced Leicester No 3 can have a bigger scrummaging impact than the Wales tighthead prop Samson Lee. England prop Dan Cole will start against Wales despite only recovering from a six-week injury lay-off . Discipline - Keep calm, Dylan . Lancaster places a huge emphasis on discipline but England’s has not been brilliant in recent times. They were heavily penalised in the defeat by South Africa last autumn when Dylan Hartley was sent to the sin-bin in the second half for a petulant stamp. The England hooker is sure to be on the receiving end of some Welsh provocation tonight and if he can keep his cool his side will benefit. If England are to stand a chance against Wales, then hooker Dylan Hartley must be able to keep his discipline . Kicking game - Chase hard and keep your nerve . Fly-half Ford impressed in the autumn with the variety of his kicking game, while scrum-half Ben Youngs is also considered a fine box kicker. England must chase well or risk the likes of George North and Alex Cuthbert returning with interest. Kicking at goal is sure to be key and will also be linked to discipline. If England concede penalties in their own half then Leigh Halfpenny  is sure to punish them as one of the world’s best goal-kickers. Ford, who is in the infancy of his international career, has been working with Jonny Wilkinson’s kicking mentor, Dave Alred, and he faces the biggest challenge of his career on Friday night. He will never have kicked in such a hostile environment. Wales full-back Leigh Halfpenny (right) is one of the world's best goal-kickers and could punish England . The breakdown - Channel No 7 . The debate over whether Chris Robshaw is an out-and-out No 7 is unlikely to die down soon but Wales have no doubts over Sam Warburton’s openside credentials. Robshaw got the better of his man at Twickenham last year and England’s work in this area will be boosted by Cole’s return. James Haskell has been dominant in this area for Wasps this season and England will look to their in-form No 6 to help speed up ball recycling in attack and slow down Welsh ball in defence. Every attacking side needs quick ball to flourish and both sides will be desperate for it on Friday night. England will hope that James Haskell (right) will be able provide them quick ball when in attack on Friday . The coaches Gatland’s been there and done it . Warren Gatland has a significant edge over Lancaster in terms of experience but a six-year contract signed last year by the England head coach leaves him knowing he has time on his side in the job. Both sides will look to spring surprises in attack and defence with the smallest advantage set to make a difference. Wales head coach Warren Gatland (left) will be looking to get one over England counterpart Stuart Lancaster . Is the roof important? Not really. The forecast is chilly but dry and with the Millennium Stadium’s steep sides the wind should not be a huge factor. Arguably the game could be faster with the fresher air which will not cause dew to form on the pitch as can happen with the roof on. England are clearly concerned about communication with decibel levels set to match a jet fighter flying at 50 feet, and having the roof open will allow some noise to dissipate.

"The blue touchpaper for Friday night's RBS 6 Nations opener has been lit after England were accused of illegal and underhand tactics. Stuart Lancaster’s side were forced to defend themselves after claims by Shaun Edwards, the Wales defence coach, that they use rugby league-style attacking moves to intentionally obstruct opposition defenders. The issue was raised at Thursday night's refereeing meeting in Cardiff, and shortly after England assistant coach Mike Catt strongly refuted the allegations of dirty tricks. Wales defence coach Shaun Edwards has accused England of using illegal and underhand tactics . George Ford runs with the ball during the England captain's run at the Millennium Stadium on Thursday . Mike Catt, pictured with fly-half Danny Cipriani, has defended the tactics and says there's nothing illegal . ‘If Shaun’s concerned about it, then he’s got it out there,’ said Catt. ‘Probably everyone in world rugby does what we do, so I don’t know what his concern is. There’s nothing illegal about it. Every team runs those sorts of shapes. I don’t know why Wales don’t do it. ‘They do! Surprise, surprise. Unless you’re running into a player, I don’t think you’re obstructing. If you go in between two players, that’s not obstruction. I’m sure he knows the rules.’ Edwards, 48, played rugby league for Wigan Warriors and Great Britain. The timing of his comments, on the eve of the big kick-off at the Millennium Stadium, will no doubt stir the pot ahead of an already emotionally charged fixture. Edwards is a former Rugby League player and was also a coach with the British & Irish Lions . Wales players warm up as they prepare to face England in the Six Nations opener on Friday night . Edwards’s concerns surround the use of blocking runners to take out tacklers without the ball, subsequently creating an overlap for the attacking team. ‘I’ve studied England’s play a lot with Martin Gleeson, the Salford coach,’ said Edwards. ‘He agreed with me that England use a style of play that is similar to the way we used to play with Wigan Warriors (alongside England backs coach Andy Farrell). ‘They try and get you to number up wrong on the left or right post, with the trigger being the full back (Mike Brown) who decides which way the attack should go. ‘They will come at you with what we call “league plays” with that ball out the back. ‘It’s important that we get our structures right and it is also important there is no obstruction of our defensive players ahead of the ball. ‘A lot of tries are disallowed in rugby league because of that. I’m sure the referees and television match officials will be well aware of that. It is a risk to do a lot of those rugby league plays because of the obstruction rule.’ Edwards says that the tactics used by England are similar to those of Rugby League side Wigan Warriors . Joe Marler passes the ball as England players warm up at the Millennium Stadium . Wales captain Sam Warburton (right) enters the stadium with coach Warren Gatland . In the build-up to Friday night's fixtures, all of the verbal attacks have been triggered by the Welsh camp. There has been no shortage of confidence from Warren Gatland’s team, who have a clean bill of health and are odds-on favourites for Friday night's meeting in Cardiff. Wales boast 448 caps in their starting XV compared to 358 in England’s; however, Red Rose coach Lancaster is not concerned about carrying the underdog tag. ‘The odds are irrelevant to me,’ said Lancaster. ‘We played pretty much the same Welsh team last year and we 100 per cent respect that they have British Lions. ‘But equally we have confidence and belief that we can do the job, because if we don’t believe that, we’ll have no chance. We definitely believe we can go there and win.’ The last time England visited the Millennium Stadium they lost 30-3 to the Welsh .","England visit the Millennium Stadium to play Wales on Friday night .

"Never mind the World Cup connotations. For now, the bigger picture can remain out of focus, in the background. Friday night it is all about Wales versus England; an annual tribal confrontation that needs no wider significance. The 2015 edition of the RBS 6 Nations explodes into life under lights and the night sky in Cardiff, with a cross-border grudge match that deserves to be viewed as the be-all and end-all for both competing nations. When the arch rivals collide at the Millennium Stadium, there will be no thought of tomorrow or the championship title, let alone events to follow later this year. Sam Warburton and Chris Robshaw pose next to the RBS 6 Nations trophy ahead of the opening game . Wales are the favourites for the clash against England on Friday night at the Millennium Stadium . The players will forget about the World Cup, and even the rest of the tournament, in the historic fixture . How the Wales and England packs compare . Few fixtures stir the blood as much as this one, which is why the result’s ramifications for Pool A of the World Cup — where the next encounter will take place in September — is a topic now on hold until the post-match dust has settled. All that will count amid the maelstrom of a typically fervent atmosphere in the Welsh capital is the here-and-now business of supremacy on the scoreboard. Any other considerations amount to so much hot air. Both teams have been determined to address this game in isolation and they are absolutely right to do so, knowing that success here will play a part in addressing the bigger picture anyway. There is vast respect for the traditions of this historic sporting duel within both camps. ‘It doesn’t get any better as a set-up to the championship,’ said England head coach Stuart Lancaster, as his men prepared to engage in what they hope will become a ghost-busting exercise. ‘It’s an iconic rugby stadium, it’s an iconic fixture, the history behind the two countries in rugby is huge.’ On behalf of Wales, an English voice struck a similar note, with Shaun Edwards adding: ‘We have always said we are judged on the Six Nations. The big competitions are the Six Nations and the World Cup. The Six Nations is very special and the oldest competition in the world.’ This is a fitting place and contest to launch the latest instalment of European rugby’s blue-riband event. In time, both Wales and England are hell-bent on usurping Ireland as champions, but they will be painfully aware that this fixture has a make-or-break feel to it. For Lancaster’s regime and for many of the players in white on Friday night, there is a subplot of far more immediate significance than the World Cup. This match represents a shot at redemption in the arena where captain Chris Robshaw and Co were subjected to a record 30-3 defeat in 2013. All involved in that debacle — which saw Grand Slam hopes blasted to oblivion — are desperate to make amends and that is a powerful motivating force in the visitors’ favour. Wasps captain James Haskell is one of those who was on duty two years ago and, recalling the bleak episode, the flanker said: ‘I was very frustrated that we didn’t win and get the Grand Slam. The nature of the way we were beaten was disappointing as well. ‘I call it getting caught in the tumble-dryer where you just keep going round and round and there’s no sign of getting out of there. There’s no purple patch — everything is a mistake compounded by a mistake. That’s a sign of a good team inflicting that on another one. ‘We’re in a completely different place this time. We’re a lot more experienced. A couple of years on, the guys have played at that level a lot more. They’ve gone behind to some big southern-hemisphere teams and clawed it back, and other scenarios which can only help keep your head calm.’ Stuart Lancaster insists England are in a 'completely different place' from where they were two years ago . The roof will be open at the Millennium Stadium when Wales host England in the Six Nations . Ominously for England, defence coach Shaun Edwards believes Wales are far better equipped for the battle . However, the ominous news for England is that Edwards believes Wales are far better equipped for the battle than they were a year ago, when they were well beaten at Twickenham. ‘We are in a better place than we were this time last year when there was a lot going on,’ he said. ‘I just feel we are more focused this year. We are also healthy, which is a massive factor.’ Certainly, a glance through the line-ups explains just why Wales are considered clear favourites. They are more or less at full strength, many of their leading players are fresh and they will have a roll-call of predatory Lions roaming the relaid turf. Two years ago, Warren Gatland’s men dashed English dreams with an onslaught founded in part on their superiority at the breakdown, based on the back-row alliance of two specialist opensides, captain Sam Warburton and Justin Tipuric. This time, the latter is in reserve, with Dan Lydiate back at blindside, but Haskell knows that he, Robshaw and their England team-mates again face an arduous task in that pivotal area of combat. ‘As a team we have to be spot on at the breakdown,’ he said. ‘We’re all aware of the threat posed by Lydiate’s ability to tackle low and Warburton coming over the ball. That’s going to be a very hot area for us. The team that gets the upper hand there will go well.’ Dejected England players look on following their 30-3 defeat to Wales in 2013 . Wales claimed the title after thrashing England at the Millennium Stadium . Manu Tuilagi is surrounded and then tackled by Jamie Roberts during the match . England are weakened by injuries, but remain strong, especially up front. Edwards was right to note: ‘England are the envy of the world when it comes to tight-five forwards.’ The intrigue will be to see whether a side with ample clout in the pack opt to adopt an arm-wrestle approach or stay true to the attacking instincts of their playmaker, George Ford, and seek to cut loose at times. If so, the onus will be on recalled Bath centre Jonathan Joseph to provide the spark in wider channels. Welsh experience is a valuable asset and Lancaster has been so alert to the issue that he has summoned Haskell and Dan Cole to start, plus Tom Croft and 36-year-old Nick Easter to take places on the bench, to provide some English nous and know-how. Composure in the cauldron will be a crucial factor, not least for the goal-kickers. Ford will need to be at the peak of his powers to match the relentlessly clinical Leigh Halfpenny. Dylan Hartley, the visitors’ hooker, is another who will have to keep his head, to avoid providing the Welsh hot-shot with ammunition and spending any more time in sin-bins or disciplinary hearings. Even if England are clear-headed and precise, it may not be enough. Wales are favourites for a reason. They have the edge in big-match pedigree, and they will have the Cardiff cacophony at their backs. A home win is the most likely outcome. What that would mean in the long run, only time will tell. George Ford will need to be at the peak of his powers to match the relentlessly clinical Leigh Halfpenny .

"A cynic might suspect Kenny McDowall knew what he was doing. The interim Rangers boss used a press conference to reveal that five Newcastle loan players shipped north on a Sports Direct truck must play if they are fit. A coach who wanted the Ibrox job on a permanent basis would be unwise to detonate a bomb under Mike Ashley. McDowall is different. He is playing out time. He began a 12-month notice period last month and the suspicion is he would be less than devastated if what he said on Thursday was taken the wrong way. If they pay him off now, he’ll cope. Scottish football thought it had seen the last of this stuff when Vladimir Romanov, the erstwhile king of Hearts, was detained by the Russian authorities. Newcastle have loaned Gael Bigirimana (left) Remie Streete (centre) and Haris Vuckic to Rangers . But Mad Vlad has merely given way to Big Mike Ashley, the de facto banker of Rangers who has now purchased the right to use one of Scotland’s biggest football clubs as a real life version of Championship Manager. Rangers, in essence, have become a nursery club for Newcastle United. A vehicle for enhancing the fitness of loan quintet Haris Vuckic from Slovenia, English defender Remie Streete, Burundi-born Gael Bigirimana, Swiss defender Kevin Mbabu and Northern Ireland winger Shane Ferguson. For the SFA, currently investigating alleged breaches of dual interest rules at Ibrox, the charge sheet is growing ahead of a hearing next month. ‘As far as I’ve been told, providing they are fit, the boys will play in the team and I’ll carry that instruction out,’ McDowall revealed. ‘In terms of once the game has started, I will make substitutions as I see fit. Rangers caretaker boss has confirmed that he must play the five Newcastle loan players in the first team . ‘It’s a slightly unenviable situation for the boys who’ve come in. But let’s not forget these boys have come from Newcastle, so they’ll be good players and it’s a good addition to our squad. It can be a positive, absolutely, and you’d hope that other people will get a lift from it.’ Recruiting five promising players from Newcastle, an established English Premiership club, could prove no bad thing. Against Celtic last weekend, Rangers were pitiful; a Samson shorn of their locks. The loan players — two defenders, two midfielders and an attacker — have the capacity to make the team better, starting with Sunday’s Cup game against Raith Rovers. The problem lies in the principle. The idea that a shareholder with 8.92 per cent of the club, heavily securitised loans and the club’s commercial valuables safely under lock and key can also dictate five of the starting places in the Rangers first team. Irrespective of form or ability. Whatever they say publicly, existing players will welcome the newcomers with the kind of enthusiasm usually reserved for a tax bill. Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley faces a hearing with the Scottish FA over his involvement with Rangers . ‘I can’t answer for the other players in the dressing room,’ said McDowall, ‘but I would hope that they would be professional and continue to work hard in training. ‘The new boys are settling in fine. They are nice lads, I met them on Wednesday. Two of them trained on the first day and the other fit one will train today. They took part in the session and did fine. ‘All the players here have to just accept that’s what happens at big clubs. Players come in — but they have to continue to work hard. ‘If I have to tell a player that I can’t pick him, that’s just where it’s at. They have to be professional.’ Under the rules set down by Ashley and Derek Llambias, only three of the five are likely to play against Raith Rovers. Ferguson and Mbabu remain a few weeks away from full fitness and have yet to arrive in Glasgow. They are not completely unknown to McDowall. ‘Myself and Ally (McCoist) went down in November to watch a Newcastle reserve game in which two of the boys played,’ he revealed. ‘But in terms of deciding which ones were coming in, I spoke with Derek about a month ago and he made me aware that he was trying to bring players in and it could possibly be five coming up.’ With Newcastle players now moving to Rangers on loan, Mike Ashley's interest in the club continues to grow . Vuckic, Bigirimana and Streete can — and will —play on Sunday. That the man ostensibly known as the manager has barely seen them play is neither here nor there. ‘All I will say is that the more I see of the boys on the training field, the more I can get working with them,’ added McDowall. ‘I would like to think that would help. But they play with Newcastle, so they are good players — let’s not forget that.’ The players, like the manager, have been placed in an unenviable situation. For a coach in normal circumstances, all of this would be intolerable. Rangers prepare for their Scottish Cup fifth round clash with Raith Rovers . Rangers new loan signings Haris Vuckic, Remie Streete and Gael Bigirimana in training at Murray Park . Agreeing to provide cover until the end of the season after Ally McCoist was placed on gardening leave, however, McDowall’s terms and conditions were made clear. Players coming and going were none of his business. He probably expected, as we all did, that he would follow McCoist onto the allotment soon enough. It’s far from impossible his revelations will force the issue, despite reiterating his commitment to his professional duties. ‘I have intimated I am working my notice, but every time I pick a team to go out there I want to win for Rangers. That will not change. ‘It’s been tough, but I am trying to get on with things as best I can. Keep the boys upbeat and try to win football matches. That’s what my job is. ‘Twelve months notice I am working and that’s me.’ He didn’t quite slap his thighs in relief, but the thought might have crossed his mind. Where the Rangers circus is concerned, every man has his limits. Gael Bigirimana: The 21-year-old has made 26 appearances for Newcastle since arriving from Coventry City in 2012 for £1m. After impressing during his first season, the Burundi-born midfielder - likened to Cheick Tiote - has failed to progress and was soon demoted to the reserves. Haris Vuckic: The playmaker joined Newcastle from Domzale in 2009 - after they beat off competition from AC Milan - but he has struggled with injuries, damaging his knee and ankle ligaments in one match for Slovenia Under 19s. He has previously been loaned out to Rotherham United and Cardiff City. Kevin Mbabu: The 19-year-old Swiss defender joined Newcastle's academy in January, 2013 but is yet to make an appearance for the first team. Remie Streete: English centre back Streete is a product of the club's youth system and joined them as a 13-year-old. He was loaned to Port Vale earlier this season. He was highly-rated all through his progression at the academy but now looks set to leave the club in the summer. Shane Ferguson: Northern Ireland winger Ferguson has made 30 appearances for Newcastle and, under Alan Pardew, enjoyed a run in the side in 2012. He lost his place, however, and hasn't featured for the first team in nearly two years. He also has 18 senior caps for his country.","Rangers have loaned five players from Newcastle until  end of the season .

"Wales begin their RBS 6 Nations campaign with a mouthwatering clash against England on Friday night. The two rivals will go head-to-head at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff - a city that has thrown up some memorable matches between both nations. Here, Sportsmail takes a trip down memory lane and selects five of the best games between the northern hemisphere foes over the years in the Welsh capital. Wales 30 England 3 March 16, 2013 - Millennium Stadium .

"The startling accuracy of Leonardo da Vinci's anatomical drawings will be highlighted by a new exhibition that compares the artist's work with modern medical scans. Long praised as one of the finest artists of the Renaissance era and a visionary inventor, da Vinci's work as an anatomist was also well ahead of its time. The forthcoming show will pitch his studies of the human body against today's high tech medical imaging technologies to show just how groundbreaking his investigations of the human body were. Remarkable accuracy: A forthcoming exhibition will compare Leonardo da Vinci's anatomical drawings with the latest modern medical scans and models to show just how true to life the artist's work was . Thirty sheets of the artist's work kept by the Royal Collection Trust are set for display at the Edinburgh International Festival in August to show just how far-sighted da Vinci’s work was. Da Vinci first began researching the human body to help him keep his paintings as 'true to nature' as possible, but the project soon took on a life of its own and he had ambitions to write an illustrated treatise on anatomy. In the course of his investigations he dissected more than 30 corpses in hospitals and medical schools, filling hundreds of pages of his notebooks with detailed sketches. Many of them date from the winter of 1510-11, when he dissected some 20 corpses at the medical school of the University of Pavia in collaboration with professor of anatomy Marcantonio della Torre. Incredibly detailed: The full image of da . Vinci's sketches bones, muscles and tendons of the hand demonstrates the . layered structure of the hand through four dissections . On the 18 sheets of what is now known as Leonardo’s Anatomical Manuscript A, the artist crammed more than 240 individual drawings and notes running to more than 13,000 words in his distinctive mirror-writing. The work, which has never before been shown in its entirety in the UK, covers almost every bone in the body and many major muscle groups. Comparison with modern day medical scans will show how, despite his limited knowledge of medicine and the limited technology to hand, Da Vinci's work was nevertheless incredibly accurate. The artist's insights could have revolutionised European knowledge of anatomy. However, on his death in 1519 they remained among his personal papers and did not see the light of day for hundreds of years. A spokesman for the Royal Collection Trust said: 'Had they been published at the time, they would undoubtedly have been the most influential work on the human body ever produced.' The muscles of the shoulder, arm and neck, c.1510-11: Many of the sketches date from the winter of 1510-11, when he dissected some 20 corpses at the medical school of the University of Pavia . The muscles of the shoulder, arm and the bones of the foot, c.1510-11: A 3D film of a dissected shoulder will show the incredible accuracy of the many drawings of the bones, muscles, nerves and tendons of the joint . A still from the 3D animation of the chest, shoulder and arm that will be shown alongside the sketches . Much of the work anticipates 21st-century medical thinking, using the same sequences of images now used to train medics. In one sheet, da Vinci demonstrates the layered structure of the hand through four dissections. He begins with the bones, adds the deep muscles of the palm, and then applies the first and second layers of tendons. Displayed alongside the work will be an animated computer simulation that replicates the artist’s layering technique and a film of a dissected hand in high-definition 3D will also allow exhibition visitors to appreciate the subtlety of the intricate structure . Ahead of his time: Thirty sheets of the artist's work kept by the Royal Collection Trust are set for display at the Edinburgh International Festival in August to show just how far-sighted da Vinci’s work was . He also recorded the muscles of the shoulder and arm in eight different views, rotating the body through 180 degrees. These drawings will be juxtaposed with a modern animation capturing the same sequence. Similarly, a 3D film of a dissected shoulder will demonstrate the incredible accuracy of da Vinci’s many drawings of the bones, muscles, nerves and tendons of the shoulder joint, seen from every angle and in every position. 'This area of the body has a complex range of motion, and Leonardo’s attempts to capture it in two-dimensional drawings are shown to be centuries ahead of his time,' the spokesman said. Other exhibition highlights include the first accurate depiction of the spine in history (1510); Leonardo’s notes from his post-mortem dissection of a 100-year-old man (conducted c.1508), in which he gives the first accurate descriptions of cirrhosis of the liver and narrowing of the arteries in the history of medicine; and the iconic and beautiful study of a child in the womb (c.1511), displayed alongside a 3D ultrasound scan of a foetus. The skeleton, c.1510-11: Da Vinci's insights could have revolutionised knowledge of anatomy. However, on his death in 1519 they remained among his personal papers and did not emerge for hundreds of years . The cardiovascular system and principal organs of a woman, c.1509-10: The exhibition is at The Queen's Gallery, Palace of Holyroodhouse, 2 August - 10 November 2013 . Exhibition curator Martin Clayton, said, ‘Royal Collection Trust’s association with the Edinburgh International Festival, in a year when its programme focuses on the theme of technology, has prompted us to examine the modern relevance of Leonardo’s astonishing drawings. 'For the first time we will be displaying the artist’s works alongside stunning examples of medical imaging, showing how the concerns and methods of the world’s leading anatomists have changed little in 500 years, and how truly ground breaking Leonardo’s investigations were.’ Director of the Royal Collection, Jonathan Marsden, said, ‘Since the opening of The Queen’s Gallery at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in 2002, our exhibition programmes have become an established part of Edinburgh’s artistic life. This new partnership with Edinburgh International Festival is the obvious next step. 'We are delighted to be taking part and hope it will provide us with a further opportunity to attract the attention of anyone who may not have visited The Queen’s Gallery before.'

"It is easy to understand why England's coaches felt Dan Cole could cope with an in-at-the-deep-end return to Test rugby. The Leicester prop is a master of understatement, which perfectly illustrates his unflappable nature. One stock response sums up the tighthead's measured outlook. Asked about the prospect of starting against Wales in Cardiff, after a year out of the international game due to injury, he calmly conceded: 'It's not ideal.' Asked to reflect on England's capitulation at the Millennium Stadium two years ago, he said: 'It wasn't ideal' - different tense, same sentiment. Dan Cole will earn his 49th England Test cap when they take on Wales in the Six Nations opener on Friday . Wilson (centre) has been ruled out of Friday's clash against Wales due to a neck injury . England have won 62.2 per cent games with Cole in their line-up compared to 58.3 per cent without . Cole, 27, has been thrown straight back into England's starting front row, after six weeks out with a foot injury - following nine months on the sidelines with a serious neck problem - because Bath's David Wilson has been ruled out. Wilson also has neck damage, leaving the Lion for whom he often deputised to fill the void at short notice. When Cole made his autumn comeback for the Tigers after surgery, he later admitted that he was not so much worried about his neck as the uncomfortable prospect that he might be 'rubbish' after so long out of the game. He need not have worried about that and he will not be concerned about what awaits on Friday night - a 49th Test cap and a head-to-head scrum collision with the wily Welsh loosehead, Gethin Jenkins. Cole's lack of game time is alleviated by an abundance of experience. He feels ready. 'Confident? I wouldn't be here if I wasn't,' he said. 'Yes, it's not the most ideal entrance to the Test scene, but I got the nine months (absence) out of the system with the eight games I played for Leicester. We had Toulon back-to-back and the Saints, so they were hardly easy games. 'You believe in the conditioning and it's not like I've done nothing over the past few weeks. I feel as best prepared as I can be. It's about getting the sharpness back. It's not like you are starting at square one when you come back in.' Cole (right) has endured an injury-plagued 12 months for England and club side Leicester Tigers (pictured) Cole (left) is helped by fellow forward Billy Vunipola during England's training session on Monday . England forwards coach Graham Rowntree insisted that there is minimal risk involved in asking Cole to resume his starting role without a suitable build-up. 'Dan is a class, proven operator,' he said. 'He's not been out for six months and he's not been twiddling his thumbs for the last six weeks. We have trained pretty fast and he's slotted in nicely. His knowledge doesn't dissipate over six weeks. Dealing with environments like Friday night comes with experience. It's good to have him around.' When he turns his focus on to the grim ordeal England endured at the Millennium Stadium in 2013, Cole's recollections of the game and the occasion are typically moderate. 'It wasn't ideal,' he said. 'You remember the day - it wasn't really a high point. It was loud. You are playing in front of 80,000 people and it's loud. It was probably a step up from what I have played in front of at the Millennium Stadium before. 'The Welsh did live off that atmosphere but I wouldn't say it threw us off our game. Both teams feed off the crowd because it provides energy.' The interruption to his career caused by a rare injury allowed Cole to take a long-overdue rest and he has returned fresh and 'a touch heavier', which won't be a prospect to encourage Jenkins. 'I'm in better nick than I was before,' said the man charged with anchoring England's set-piece assault. If he says that, it must be true, because even mild hyperbole is not his style. Cole was part of the England side that were thrashed 30-3 in their last Six Nations visit to Wales in 2013 .","Wales host England in the Six Nations opener on Friday night .

"Homeopathy has long been slated as witchcraft, due to the lack of proper scientific evidence that it works. Now, one scientist has taken matters into her own hands to prove the point. Yvette d’Entremont, a forensic chemist from southern California, filmed herself downing 50 homeopathic sleeping tablets in one go to prove they were nothing but 'sugar pills' with no active ingredients. Ninety minutes later, she reported feeling no different - and says this proves thousands of people the world over are being misled. Scroll down for video . Yvette d’Entremont, a forensic chemist from southern California, filmed herself downing 50 homeopathic sleeping pills to prove they were nothing but 'sugar pills' with no active ingredients . However 90 minutes later, she reported feeling no different. Her experiment was part of her campaign to stop national pharmacy retailers selling homeopathic products that 'have no medicine in them' Her experiment was part of her campaign to stop national pharmacy retailers in the U.S. selling homeopathic products, which, as she puts it 'have no f***ing medicine' in them. Ms d’Entremont, who goes under the alias Science Babe, wrote in a recent blog: '[The theory is] that diluting a substance makes it more powerful. By this line of thinking, the dilutions continue in succession several times. 'In the homeopathic remedies that are sold over the counter, they dilute the medications to the point where there is no measurable dose of the alleged active ingredient. 'Allow me to rephrase: THERE'S NO F***ING MEDICINE.' She adds that homeopathic remedies rely on the notion that water has a 'memory' - and the more you dilute a medicine, the stronger that memory gets and the more potent the medicine becomes. During her six-minute film, she slates national pharmacy brands that even sell their own branded versions of homeopathic treatments - accusing them of endorsing 'pseudo science' and saying customers deserve better. She goes on to say: 'I don’t know about you, but if I’ve just had an allergic reaction I don’t want the homeopathic version of epinephrine for my medication.' The petition reads: . Please stop carrying homeopathic treatments at your pharmacies. Your stores carry real medications that are proven to work. Homeopathic remedies are defined to be diluted to the point were they no longer contain any of the active ingredient. By selling homeopathic remedies, you are endorsing remedies that may prevent people from seeking real treatments that work. Because of this, they can be dangerous. To clarify, this is not targeting 'natural' remedies like supplements. This is solely about the products labeled 'homeopathic' and with active ingredients measured in 'HPUS' units, indicating that there is no measurable active ingredient. 'If I’ve just had surgery, I don’t want the homeopathic version of morphine. I want the real shot, not no medicine.' To prove her point, she opens a bottle containing 50 homeopathic sleeping pills and begins to take the whole bottle, washing handfuls of pills down with Diet Coke. 'There is more actual drug in the caffeine in the Coke I'm drinking,' she adds. To test the theory that homeopathic pills are purely a 'sugar pill', she even crunches one to see. 'It does taste like sugar - it's delightful,' she says. However she urges caution on repeating her experiment at home. 'I really know how to read these labels so I can tell these pills have no medicine in them. 'Never try this with anything like melatonin or Benadryl.' Fast forward 45 and then 90 minutes and how is she feeling? Exactly the same - and 'not even slightly drowsy'. Ms d’Entremont has now started a petition on Change.org calling for national chains to stop selling selling homeopathic medicine. It states: 'People will still buy products from your stores, but instead they'll buy products that actually work with proven claims.' But both the British Medical Association and the UK Government's science and technology committee say the NHS should stop funding homeopathic treatments because of a lack of evidence they work. The BMA has described homeopathy as ‘witchcraft’, and last summer the Advertising Standards Authority said homeopaths were putting people’s lives at risk by discouraging them from seeking medical treatment. To test the theory that homeopathic pills are purely a 'sugar pill', she even crunches one to see. 'It does taste like sugar - it's delightful,' she says . And earlier this year, an Australian study concluded that homeopathy was no more effective than placebo. Australia’s National Health and Medical Research Council analysed research into the effectiveness of alternative medicines on 68 health conditions and found ‘there is no reliable evidence that homeopathy is effective’ on any of them. The review, conducted by a working committee of medical experts, said homeopathy had no impact on a range of conditions including asthma, arthritis, sleep disturbances, cold and flu, chronic fatigue syndrome, eczema, cholera, burns, malaria and heroin addiction. Earlier this year, an Australian study concluded homeopathy was no more effective than placebo . The authors of the report said: ‘No good-quality, well-designed studies with enough participants for a meaningful result reported either that homeopathy caused greater health improvements than a substance with no effect on the health condition [placebo], or that homeopathy caused health improvements equal to those of another treatment.’ They went on to dismiss anecdotal support for the effectiveness of homeopathy, and urged health professionals to take account of scientific evidence when informing patients. ‘It is not possible to tell whether a health treatment is effective or not simply by considering individuals’ experiences or healthcare practitioners’ beliefs,’ they said. Homeopathy is a complementary medicine, the central principle of which is that ‘like cures like’ – that a substance that causes certain symptoms can also help to remove them in tiny doses. In England there are several NHS homeopathic hospitals and some GP practices offer the treatment but it is not widely available. The report prompted medical professionals to call for governments to stop legitimising homeopathy. Professor John Dwyer, an immunologist and emeritus professor of medicine at the University of New South Wales, told Guardian Australia the report was long overdue and said homeopathic treatments should now be ‘put away’ once and for all. He said: ‘Obviously we understand the placebo effect. We know that many people have illnesses that are short lived by its very nature and their bodies will cure them, so it’s very easy for people to fall in trap that because they did A, B follows.’ He added he did not think it ethical to prescribe a placebo. facebook.com/sciencebabe, @sciencebabe .","Yvette d’Entremont is a forensic chemist from Southern California .

"The humble cabbage could be the key to protecting people from radiation during cancer therapy. Researchers claim a compound derived from cruciferous vegetable - such as cabbage, cauliflower and broccoli - protected rats and mice from lethal doses of radiation. Their study suggests the compound, already shown to be safe for humans, may protect normal tissues during radiation therapy for cancer treatment and prevent or mitigate sickness caused by radiation exposure. The humble cabbage could be the key to protecting people from radiation during cancer therapy, according to latest research in the U.S. The compound - known as DIM (or ,3'-diindolylmethane) - previously has been found to have cancer preventative properties. The study's corresponding author Doctor Eliot Rosen, of Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Centre in the U.S., said: ‘DIM has been studied as a cancer prevention agent for years, but this is the first indication that DIM can also act as a radiation protector.’ For the study, the researchers irradiated rats with lethal doses of gamma ray radiation. The animals were then treated with a daily injection of DIM for two weeks, starting 10 minutes after the radiation exposure. Their study suggests the compound, already shown to be safe for humans, may protect normal tissues during radiation therapy for cancer treatment and prevent or mitigate sickness caused by radiation exposure . The DIM compound can be derived from cruciferous vegetable such as cabbage, cauliflower and broccoli . The result was stunning, according to Dr Rosen, who is a professor of oncology, biochemistry and cell and molecular biology, and radiation medicine. He said: ‘All of the untreated rats died, but well over half of the DIM-treated animals remained alive 30 days after the radiation exposure.’ Dr Rosen added that DIM also provided protection whether the first injection was administered 24 hours before or up to 24 hours after radiation exposure. He said: ‘We also showed that DIM protects the survival of lethally irradiated mice.’ In addition, irradiated mice treated with DIM had less reduction in red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets - side effects often seen in patients undergoing radiation treatment for cancer. He said the study points to two potential uses of the compound, adding: ‘DIM could protect normal tissues in patients receiving radiation therapy for cancer, but could also protect individuals from the lethal consequences of a nuclear disaster.’ Dr Rosen and his colleagues are co-inventors on a patent application that has been filed by Georgetown University related to the usage of DIM and DIM-related compounds as radio-protectors. The research was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.","The compound, called DIM, also reduced severity of radiation effects .

"The man in charge of curing cricket of corruption is adamant that he made the right decision in allowing convicted spot-fixer Mohammad Aamer to return to the game seven months ahead of the end of his five-year ban. Sir Ronnie Flanagan, chairman of the International Cricket Council’s anti-corruption unit, insists that his controversial decision that opens up the possibility of Aamer returning at the highest level against England in October will not set a dangerous precedent for other offenders. Speaking ahead of the World Cup, the former chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary took full responsibility for throwing the gifted but flawed Aamer a lifeline but said he understands those who say he has been too lenient. Mohammad Aamer pictured in Lahore last month. He is close to a possible return to competitive cricket after serving most of a five-year suspension for spot-fixing . Aamer in action for Pakistan against England at Edgbaston in August 2010 before his five-year ban . ‘I fully respect the views of those who say that this shouldn't have happened but personally I’m content that it was right,’ said Flanagan here in Sydney. ‘He’s returned to a level of domestic cricket with no input in the international sphere whatsoever seven months early. I’m satisfied that the right thing was done. ‘We in anti-corruption in cricket say resolutely that we have zero tolerance and some people have said ‘well, how can this come about then?’ I believe you can have zero tolerance but it doesn’t mean the same punishment should apply to each incident. It’s my discretion and I stand by it and take responsibility for it.’ Aamer was one of the best young fast bowlers in the world when he was jailed along with his captain Salman Butt and experienced colleague Mohammad Asif after being caught by a News of the World sting bowling no balls in the Lord’s Test against England on demand for money. He received more sympathy than his team-mates because it was widely felt he was manipulated by those in authority who should have known better but he was still banned for five years from having any involvement in the game. Aamer was exposed for bowling no balls at specific times during Pakistan's Test with England at Lord's . Now Aamer, still only 22, has been cleared to play in Pakistani domestic cricket and has kept himself in good enough shape to have a realistic chance of being ready to play when England tour the United Arab Emirates later this year. ‘It was after a very rigorous examination of the entire case and a thorough consideration of his personal input and reaction that this decision was made,’ said Flanagan. ‘Did he plead guilty? Was he truly remorseful for what he’d done? The timing of that is important too. The process I went through and the decision I arrived at does not set any improper precedent for others. ‘I looked into it very carefully and have interviewed Aamer several times and I’m satisfied he met all the conditions. He has fully admitted his part in what happened, told us all he knows and was very co-operative with us.’ A crucial factor in Aamer’s partial amnesty was his willingness to take part in the ICC’s education programme trying to stop others making the mistakes that cost him his freedom and a large chunk of a highly promising career. Aamer celebrates taking the wicket of Alastair Cook during the Lord's Test in June 2010 . ‘It’s all very well being told not to do something by an ex-cop but I think it’s something else all together to hear it from someone who was an international cricketer and fell from grace,’ said Flanagan. ‘He is saying to them ‘please don’t do what I did. Please don’t succumb.’ I think that’s a powerful message. ‘What has happened is that he can now engage in domestic cricket under the auspices of the PCB in Pakistan. I’m very comfortable that that’s the right thing to do. He has made videos on our behalf that we have shown players highlighting exactly how he fell from grace and what happened to him. ‘He described how, when he won his first cap, he slept all night in his shirt that showed he was representing his country and what it meant for him and his family to fall from grace. Whether he’ll return to the international game depends on his ability and the PCB. 'If he should do and he continues to be that person who delivers that message to others that they shouldn’t put themselves in the position he put himself in then that is a very strong message.’ A shamed Aamer arrives at Southwark Crown Court in London in November 2011. Along with team-mates Salman Butt and Mohammad Asif, he was found guilty by the court of conspiracy to cheat and conspiracy to accept corrupt payments during the Lord's Test . The distinguished senior policeman accepts that the battle against corruption in cricket is an ongoing one and had strong words for those who will attempt to manipulate and abuse the World Cup which starts next week. ‘We know that there are rotten people out there, criminal people who will do all in their power to get at players and others of influence within the game,’ said Flanagan. ‘They’ll trick them, coerce them and are almost like paedophiles in how they attempt to groom people into ultimately doing what suits their nefarious intentions. ‘We have gone to great lengths to ensure that they don’t get their way and I’m certain the players, officials and support staff will be working very carefully in support of what we are trying to do and we will be working in partnership to ensure that they never get their way. ‘I would like to assure the paying public that they will be coming to a tournament where all of those involved have done all in their power to ensure it is free from corruption or the threat of corruption.’","Pakistan bowler Aamer will return to action seven months early .

Demi Barnes, only posted a picture of her dress, designed as part of her GCSE art coursework, on Facebook to show it to a cousin in Italy. But within days, her impressive design had gone viral getting more than 40,000 'likes' and prompting several admirers to ask 15-year-old Demi to design their wedding dress. Online hit: Demi Barnes's wedding dress made from more than 1,500 divorce papers has gone viral after she posted a picture of it on Facebook . Demi, a student at Lingfield Notre Dame School in Surrey, designed the dress to represent the notion that too many people rush into getting married and end up getting divorced . The stunning gown, reminiscent of the Emanuelle gown worn by Princess Diana or one of Thelma Madine's elaborate designs as seen on Channel 4 show My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding, was made using more than 1,500 genuine divorce papers. Demi, a student at Lingfield Notre Dame School in Surrey, designed the dress to represent the notion that too many people rush into getting married and end up getting divorced. She said: 'When I put it up on Facebook, it was just to show my cousin in Italy what I’d been up to. 'Within a week, it had had over 40,000 hits and people were approaching me to design their wedding dresses. Diana, Princess of Wales following her wedding. The schoolgirl was inspired by the iconic gown . 'Major designers have asked for copies. 'I’m passionate about fashion and design and am hoping someone will approach me with a work experience placement so I can turn my passion into a career.'' Head of Art at Demi's school, Claire Davis added: 'Demi became charged, like electricity, when she had the idea for the dress. 'This was an incredibly ambitious piece and it took courage, patience and tenacity to see this through from concept to final piece.' Demi was originally going to make the dress out of magazines but decided upon a more interesting concept and put it together using a wire bodice frame and stapled divorce papers onto it. Lingfield Notre Dame headmaster Richard Bool said that her design is the talk of her class. He said: 'I’m extremely proud of the work Demi and the entire Art Department have achieved this academic year. 'It is also a pleasure to see the power of social media working for a student in a positive and responsible way.'","Demi Barnes created the stunning dress as part of her GCSE art exam .

"'Smart scales' could be the key to the rehabilitation of patients suffering from eating disorders. A recent study has found that 75 per cent of patients treated using the Mandometer method were free of symptoms one year later. The Swedish method sees patients re-learn normal eating behaviour by using a feedback device attached to a scale. Success story: The Mandometer weighs the food on the plate and tells the patient at what speed they should be eating. It also asks them to register how full they feel, re-training normal eating behaviour . The Mandometer food scale is attached to a computer which tells the patient how much they should be eating and how full they should feel to achieve normal eating habits. The patient places their plate on the scale and puts their allocated food on the plate. As the patient eats, the computer registers the speed they eat and the patient puts in how full he or she is feeling throughout the meal. If the patient is eating too slowly, the computer registers this and tells them to speed up, aiming to finish the meal in 15 minutes. The registered feeling of fullness is shown as a second curve, with the aim of following a 'normal' pattern. The goal is to re-train the brain, and to see the patient return to a normal eating behaviour within three to four months. Good work: A recent study has found that 75 per cent of patients treated using the Mandometer method were in remission 12.5 months later . Once patients normalise eating patterns they no longer feel rewarded for eating less or purging, targeting the psychiatric symptoms behind the eating disorder. The new study, published in the American Psychological Associations' journal Behavioral Neuroscience, found that within 12.5 months on average, 75 per cent of all patients were free of symptoms and only ten per cent of patients relapsed over five years. ‘This follow-up on 18 years of work show that treatment on a neurobiological base is effective’, says Per Södersten, professor of behavioural neuroendocrinology at Karolinska Institutet's Department of Neurobiology. The device can also be used in reverse, teaching people who are overweight not to eat too fast. Just three years ago, the NHS bought several Mandometers to use to tell people to eat slower and to remind them to think if they are feeling full.","Swedish invention used to re-train the brain on how to eat normally .

"Total number of London theatre-goers last year – 22 million. Total attendance at Premier League matches last season – 13.94 million. The after-party has been as embarrassing and depressing as the World Cup performance. Las Vegas has become the go-to destination for failed England footballers and it was along that gaudy Strip that Jack Wilshere chose to commemorate his putrid contribution on the great stage of Brazil 2014. Once our great white hope, now our big white dope, Wilshere drowned his and the nation’s sorrows by drinking and smoking in a casino’s swimming pool. Up in smoke: Jack Wilshere and a gaggle of friends enjoy the scene in Las Vegas . Joe Hart, who kept goal against Luis Suarez like a petrified rabbit, saw fit to join Wilshere in the company of boozy hangers-on and girls hanging out of their bikinis. Each to his own way of grieving, I suppose. Most in this country were caught in a confusion of shock and mourning after the quickest and most humiliating World Cup finals exit in England’s history. To his credit, the captain has had the decency to retire from the international game. One of the few to have worn the white shirt with distinction in recent years, Steven Gerrard honestly admitted he was on his last legs in Brazil. Not that he was the only Englishman left flagging in the slipstream of football’s high-speed development at this tournament. Inadvertently, however, Gerrard has been equally frank about the limitations of the domestic game which finds itself burdened with rekindling public interest in our national sport after its thorough World Cup dowsing. Gerrard reveals that this was biting advice to Suarez as he pondered his transfer to Barcelona: ‘I told him not to go to Arsenal. With all due respect to them, he is too good for Arsenal.’ Speaking his mind: Steven Gerrard (left) told Luis Suarez he was 'too good' to join Arsenal . Swansong: Ashley Cole heads to Roma . With those few words he exposed the delusional notion of the Premier League as the greatest in the world. Arsenal are one of the big five clubs in England. They qualify for the Champions League as regularly as that giant clock high behind one goal at the Emirates ticks off each unforgiving minute without a goal. Yet in the estimation of one of the iconic figures of our football they are not worthy of signing a truly world-class goal-scorer, even though he is psychologically flawed. That will come as interesting reading to Chile’s national hero Alexis Sanchez as he travels in the reverse direction, from Barcelona to Arsenal, in contradiction of the trend for most of the stars at this World Cup to move anywhere other than England. English footballers – with the exception of veterans like Ashley Cole and Frank Lampard as they venture in search of a last hurrah – shuffle between our own teams. So much of a muchness are they that a club like Southampton can sell off a whole bunch of its first team players and still express confidence that an incoming job-lot of cheap signings and an upsurge of youngsters will be good enough for another season of Premier League survival. Depressingly, they are probably right. Revolving door policy: New Saints boss Ronald Koeman has seen  many of last year's first team depart . Worryingly, by cherry-picking those they perceive to be the most Saintly, Liverpool may turn into the next Tottenham – even as their resurgence has just carried them closer to the Premier League title than for many a season. Spurs thought mistakenly that it would be good business to spend the fortune Real Madrid paid them for Gareth Bale on a half a team of average players. Now Liverpool are doing the same with the Suarez money. Perhaps they are right that Rickie Lambert has a few goals left in his aging legs. Perhaps not. As for Adam Lallana, his mundane efforts in Brazil came as little surprise to those of us who saw pictures of him posing with his underpants exposed, as well as a grotesque tattoo. Given that this vain posturing was in inverse proportion to the way in he floundered out of his depth at the World Cup it is hard to resist the conclusion that here, as with Wilshere, is yet another young English footballer who is under the premature misconception that he is already a superstar. Since he will be injured for some weeks, we will have to wait to see whether Lallana can justify his £25million fee. Don't believe the hype: Adam Lallana cost Liverpool £25m yet does he already think he's a superstar? VIDEO Liverpool v Manchester City highlights . Not that he was alone among over-hyped youngsters who found themselves overwhelmed in Brazil. Defensively sound? Luke Shaw . Danny Welbeck never recovered from a poor start. Jordan Henderson was pedestrian. Luke Shaw, when his chance came, looked like another in the succession of left backs who are good going forward but dodgy at defending. Even Raheem Sterling disappeared after a bright beginning against what we came to realise was an Italian team almost as pathetic as England. The declining quality of the English footballer is playing into the descent of the Premier League. It is having a negative effect on the quality of the imports. Spain, Germany, France in the case of Paris Saint-Germain, even Italy now that Serie A is enjoying a renaissance, have taken over as the destinations of choice for the world class footballer. When the public discern more drama, entertainment and excitement on the London stage than at football’s theatres of dreams, the Premier League find itself caught somewhere between slipping into the wings and turning itself into a circus of cheap commercial thrills. And as its false idols admire themselves so narcissistically in the mirror, they may care to reflect on another revealing pair of statistics. Only one actor in every 50 on the London stage earns more than £20,000 a year. Average salary of the Premier League player - £31,000 a week. Jose Mourinho’s sanity was questioned when he sold David Luiz to Paris Saint-Germain and Juan Mata to Manchester United, while tempting Everton into paying a club record fee for Romelu Lukaku by lending him to them even though he seemed to need a goal-scorer at Chelsea. How the World Cup has proved the Special One right. Would PSG still have lavished £50m on Luiz after seeing his catastrophic performances for Brazil? Highly doubtful. Lukaku, only in the Belgian team because of injury to others, was dropped after an utterly ineffective first game and remained on the bench thereafter. Yet Everton have still shelled out £28m. Great bit of business: Romelu Lukaku joined Everton to boost Chelsea's coffers to the tune of £28m . Mata, did well enough at Old Trafford to grab a last minute plane ticket to Brazil but was left out of Spain’s team for the first two matches of their disastrous world title defence. Even then he was still only recalled as late substitute during their dead rubber third game. A meaningless goal in that match was hardly retrospective justification for a giant fee – but United’s £37m was already in Mourinho’s transfer chest. Along with all his marbles. The Glazer family are attempting to sell another multi-million pound chunk of their holding in Manchester United, after their appointment of Louis van Gaal revived the previously ailing share price. Which begs one awkward question: do the American owners not fully share the faith of the market in Van Gaal being the Dutch Sir Alex Ferguson?","Steven Gerrard exposed the delusional notion of the Premier League as the greatest in the world .

"Arsene Wenger has revealed Arsenal duo Francis Coquelin and Chuba Akpom have signed new four-and-a-half-year deals. Coquelin has been in impressive form since being recalled from his loan spell at Championship outfit Charlton in December, while Akpom has made four first-team appearances since the start of the year. Both Akpom and Coquelin were set to become free agents in the summer, however Wenger has tied both Coquelin and Akpom down to new long-term contracts. Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin has signed a new long-term deal at the Emirates Stadium . Gunners youngster Chuba Akpom has also put pen to paper on a new four-and-a-half year contract . Wenger, speaking before Arsenal's Barclays Premier League derby match against Tottenham, said: 'I am very happy because for me the target during this transfer window was on two fronts. 'The first was to get a defender in and we did that. The second is as well to extend the contracts of Coquelin and Akpom. 'That's what I did as well so we are very happy with what we did.' Coquelin recently said he was surprised by his 'sudden' move back to the Emirates Stadium. Speaking to Arsenal Player, Coquelin said: 'It’s weird because the way it happened was so sudden, so I didn’t expect it. 'I trained with the team all week and on Monday I was going to see the Charlton manager with a few other people about a change of formation. 'I felt a little bit bad about Charlton because we had trained all week, were ready for the game and it was so sudden.'

"She has courted international controversy by turning herself into a human doll using plastic surgery and thick layers of dramatic make-up, confessing she wishes to be considered 'the most perfect woman on the internet'. With her pinched waist, skeletal arms, enormous coloured contact lenses and vacant expression, Ukraine's Valeria Lukyanova, 23, believes she has become a living, breathing Barbie, something she sees as the ultimate embodiment of perfection. But how well do we really know her? A VICE documentary-maker has gone behind the scenes with Valeria - who currently has 876,000 fans on her Facebook page - journeying to Ukraine to capture her idiosyncratic life on film. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Creepy crawlies: Valeria Lukyanova in a VICE photoshoot which she took part in alongside their documentary film about her life . 'I'd seen her like everyone else when . she popped up on the internet with all those bewildering and bizarre . images and videos,' VICE director Will Fairman told MailOnline. 'And thought there had to be something more behind it all, because I could see little flecks of esoteric stuff. 'I followed it up and discovered she was a new age opera composer and gave seminars on spirituality, so she obviously had a . few more strings to her bow than just being a tumblr girl.' Will negotiated coming to the Ukraine to film Valeria, despite the model being 'a little bit skeptical' at first. 'I think she was probably protection herself,' said Will. 'She'd appeared on various talk shows in the past and they were mainly trying to do one on her, so there was a lot of back and forth. We finally secured coming over when we said we'd focus on her spiritual and astral theories.' Valeria believes she is from another planet - possibly Venus, but she isn't quite sure - so isn't really human like the rest of us. I am not human: Valeria believes she is from another planet - possibly Venus, but she isn't sure - and so isn't actually human . 'She's not a fraud,' clarified Will. 'She genuinely believes she's from another planet. 100 per cent. She's not making any money from her life - not even from the seminars she gives - which is originally why I thought she was doing this.' Valeria, who is supported by her construction-working husband who also acts as her manager, spends the film discussing theories about her pre-Earth space life, and how she has become an object of hatred within some internet communities. 'I come from a place where only love and joy exist,' she says. 'But I noticed the media is only interested in negativity: show someone in a bad light, show someone's mistakes. 'There are hate blogs and communities about me who post bad pictures about me and try and worsen my mood. 'Perhaps . at some point I was an energy vampire, because I constantly received . their negative reactions and enjoyed it. Specifically for them I created . posts that would make them angry. 'But people who think badly of me just aren't happy in their own lives. When they are happy they will forget about me.' Perfection: Will says Valeria holds herself in the way we see her all the time, and never lets her 'character' drop . I hear voices: Valeria, at home, admitting on film that she hears voices and sees 'different beings', which is why she has been to see a psychiatrist . Valeria, who says she has a 'small group of friends who accept me for who I am', also admits she has visited a psychiatrist about the voices in her head. But just the once. She is not in therapy. She said: 'I asked myself if everything was alright with my head. I hear voices all . the time and see different beings. One day I decided to visit a . psychiatrist. I told him everything. 'He listened to me carefully and . said it was very lucky it was him because with another doctor I definitely . would have been taken to a special place. But he said, ""I've been . studying esoterism for years and can see you are psychic"".' Will said: 'Valeria manages her appearance down to the finest detail, which is why something so tiny as a missing belt can trigger a stroke' On film: Valeria has said in the past that she has neck problems, which is why it's always flopped to one side . Describing how he found Valeria, Will added: 'She's kind of like the really pretty, . popular girl at school who you're completely blown away by. 'She's like a little queen, and . she carries herself like that all the time. She never breaks. It's not like the camera turns off and she whips out a cigarette and gets into a tracksuit. 'She's naturally like that: a girl who has been getting attention ever since she was a teenager and gets crazy attention wherever she is. 'And she is paranoid about not looking perfect. I don't know exactly where it comes from, but I suspect . really it's down to... she seems to have a quite a lot of issues about her . physical self, and is incredibly fixated with her image. 'She manages it . down to the finest detail, which is why something so much as a missing belt can trigger a stroke.'

"A now-former teacher at a Texas high school was arrested this week after authorities say she had a sexual relationship with a 16-year-old student and then asking others to lie to the police about the alleged misconduct. In at least one case, the unidentified student told authorities that he and 26-year-old Kelly Lynn Thompson had sexual contact in her car is it was parked in front of the boy's parents' home. According to court documents, the Cypress Lakes High School's Independent School District Police received a call from a witness who said Thompson had been having a relationship with a student. Inappropriate: 26-year-old Kelly Thompson is accused of having a sexual relationship with a 16-year-old student and with witness tampering .

"These rare photographs show the hard labour of Victorian miners digging for tin deep below the earth in extremely dangerous conditions. The images, taken in the darkness of four separate mines in Cornwall, were captured with the help of very early flash technology, which allowed photographer J.C. Burrow to bring the underground world to life. Published in 1893, Mr Burrow's photographs show the miners clambering through the warren of tunnels, held up by precarious wooden beams, as they dug out tin and copper and to fuel industrial Britain. Toil: A bare-chested miner can be seen pushed a cart through Cook's Kitchen Mine in Cornwall, as fellow miners operate the machinery . Illuminated: Photographer J.C. Burrow used rudimentary flash technology to light up the underground scenes . Precarious: Miners climb rickety ladders in the image to the left, while, right, a man prepared to load a mine cart with ore . The workers toiled in very harsh conditions - often for little pay - all the while breathing in filthy air under the ground. Accidents were common - indeed at Dolcoath, one of the mines pictured, seven men were crushed after timber supports gave way around the same time the photographs were published. Some frames show the miners hard at work, drilling bore holes into the rock and setting up heavy machinery - while another shows them at rest, eating traditional Cornish pasties. Mr Burrow was commissioned to take the photographs by local mine owners, who wanted to showcase the technology used in their underground enterprise. The illustrated guide which he produced - 'Mongst Mines and Miners: Underground Scenes by Flash-Light - was later used as a teaching aid. At least four separate mines were featured in his book - Dolcoath, a copper and tin mine in Camborne; East Pool in Redruth; Blue Hills tin mine in St Agnes, and Cook's Kitchen mine in Pool. Hard at it: In this frame the miners can be seen boring into the rock. The tin and copper from Cornish mines sold for millions across the nation . Cramped: Mines would often have to scrambled between the beams in claustrophobic conditions . At ease: In this more relaxed picture the miners are seen at rest, as many of them eat Cornish pasties . Digging for victory: Here workers in East Pool Mine start work on a bore hole headed towards the surface . In order to illuminate his photographs Mr Burrow rigged up a system of lamps filled with highly flammable magnesium powder. He then instructed teams of miners to light the powder, creating a bright flash which allowed him to capture the scene. The process was difficult, time-consuming and often didn't work - of the 100 images only 24 were deemed printable, and Mr Burrow wrote of how a whole day's work would often turn out to be useless. In a text describing his efforts, he wrote: 'It is a . rather disheartening experience to find the results of a whole days . work with an energetic band of helpers are not ""printable"", but such . experience was mine on more than one occasion. 'The . work, however is so full of interest, and its performance so productive . of welcome enlightenment on many critical points, that I have no . intention of allowing it to remain where it is. I hope that at no distant date, the present attempt may be followed by another and more successful one.' Technology: J.C. Burrows was commissioned to take the series of photographs to showcase the mines' advances . Widespread: At its peak, the mining industry employed as many as 25 per cent of Cornwall's working men . Heritage: Mr Burrow was commissioned to photograph the mines by their owners, and compiled the results in 'Mongst Mines and Miners: Underground Scenes by Flash-Light, right . Locations: JC Burrows took his photographs in several mines, including East Pool, left, and Blue Hills, right. They are pictured above as they are today . A copy of the book is for sale in an upcoming auction, and is expected to fetch £2,250. It goes under the hammer at this year's PBFA London International Antiquarian Book Fair, on May 23 and 24. Bookseller Michael Kemp said: 'Mr Burrow was attempting to showcase the mining technology of his age, but in doing so he devised some pretty groundbreaking methods of his own. 'Using explosive materials in the open air would be challenging enough back in 1893, but to do it in the pitch dark confines of an underground mine shaft seems unthinkable. 'Evidently our late Victorian counterparts did not share our modern day obsession with health and safety.' Cornwall's rich veins of tin and copper have made it a centre of the mining industry since pre-historic times. Cornish mining interests are suggested as one reason for the Roman invasion of Britain, and medieval documents attest to the productivity of the early mines. But it was with the advent of the industrial revolution when mining in Cornwall really came into its own, prompted by demand for the valuable metals in industrial production. At its peak, mining in Cornwall employed as many as 25 per cent of the county's working men. Plans: South Crofty was Europe's last functioning tin mine, but closed in 1998. It has been suggested that rising prices could lead to the mine re-opening, but this is yet to happen . Although the conditions underground were unforgiving, the work paid better than the alternatives of fishing or farming. Billions of pounds worth of metal was dragged up from the earth during the industry's late 1800s peak, though the Cornish industry experienced periodic slumps as prices rose and fell due to competition and new technology. By the latter half of the 19th century many mines in the area had been forced to close thanks to intense competition from mines elsewhere in the world. According to Cornish Mining Heritage, as many as half a million miners left Cornwall between 1815 and 1915, often setting up their own mines in other countries such as Australia, South Africa and the the U.S. The industry continued in Cornwall - albeit at a much lower capacity - until the late 1990s. South Crofty mine - the last working tin mine in Europe - remained open until 1998. Plans have been suggested to re-open the mine in light of increased global tin prices, but have yet to materialise.","Photographs taken by J.C.

"A Texas elementary school teacher has been charged with sexually assaulting a six-year-old kindergarten student. The Austin school district has fired 33-year-old Alfredo Andrade-Gaytan. Andrade-Gaytan taught a bilingual kindergarten class at a central Austin elementary school. Alfredo Andrade-Gaytan: He has been arrested and charged with aggravated sexual assault of a child after a 6-year-old girl told her parents that Andrade-Gaytan had assaulted her . Unexpected: Andrade-Gaytan, a third-grade bilingual teacher, had been teaching a summer school program at Reilly Elementary. According to an arrest affidavit, Andrade-Gaytan kept a six-year-old girl in the classroom while the remainder of the class went to recess and asked her if she’d like to play a game.. She was a student in Andrade-Gaytan’s summer Kindergarten class at Reilly Elementary. Police tried to question Andrade-Gaytan on Thursday, but he denied being alone with the girl. The girl told a parent she had been assaulted. Investigators say she was taken to a hospital, and DNA evidence has been found on her clothing. On Friday, Andrade-Gaytan allegedly called AISD police to confess, saying he wanted to talk about 'making a mistake.' There is no evidence that other students had been or will be in any danger. Communication: A letter was sent home to parents explaining the situation. School officials said that nothing came up on Andrade-Gaytan¿s criminal background checks when he was hired and subsequent checks were clean . Andrade-Gaytan was removed from the classroom immediately following the allegations. Investigators don’t believe that Andrade-Gaytan knew the student, and he only had her in class one day. People who commit sex crimes on children tend to choose targets they are more familiar with, said Eric Mendez, the district’s police chief. 'This is very disturbing. This is not typical behavior,' Mendez said. 'Usually in these types of incidents the suspect knows their victim or their intended victim for some time.' As of late Saturday, Andrade-Gaytan remained in the Travis County Jail on $50,000 bail. It was unclear whether he had hired an attorney. Police Chief Eric Mendez: The teacher came in yesterday and during an interview provided information and confirmed that he did indeed sexually assault the child . Andrade-Gaytan had taught in the school district since 2009 and earned $43,000 a year. He has been a teacher with AISD since Aug. 2005. He has taught at McBee, Linder and Walnut Creek elementary schools. School officials said that nothing came up on Andrade-Gaytan’s criminal background checks when he was hired and subsequent checks were clean. Kalina Orwick has four kids that attend Walnut Creek Elementary school. She said the fact that this was a kindergartner is very disturbing. 'They don't even know how to spell, they barely know their ABCs and they have to worry about parents and teachers that are crazy,' said Ms Orwick to Fox News. History: Andrade-Gaytan has worked at several AISD campuses including Linder, McBee, Reed, and most recently teaching 3rd graders at Walnut Creek Elementary . Orwick said it's scary as a parent to know you can't trust your child's teachers. 'I think they deserve to be protected just like how we protect them at home, it needs happen at school,' said Ms Orwick. 'You can very well put cameras or something in the classroom so we can see what they're actually doing. That's the problem. The teachers are free to say and do whatever they want,' she said. Several of Andrade-Gaytan’s neighbors stood in the main street of their subdivision Saturday discussing his arrest for sexual assault, which they’d learned of minutes earlier from a post on the neighborhood association’s Facebook page. 'I’m in shock,' said Michael Collins, to the Austin American-Statesman. 'I don’t even know what to say.' Andrade-Gaytan had lived in the house for about two years with his wife and their two children, a 6-year-old son and a 3-year-old daughter, the neighbors said.","Alfredo Andrade-Gaytan, 33, has been fired following the charges .

"More than three million people died from alcohol consumption in 2012 with Australia playing host to some of the world's heaviest drinkers, a new report reveals. About 11 percent of Australians aged over 15 years are heavy drinkers and consume on average 10.4 litres of alcohol per year, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). The report has prompted the health agency to call on governments to do more to reduce harmful drinking. The World Health Organisation found that about 11 percent of Australians aged over 15 years were heavy drinkers . Drinking kills more men than women and increases people's risk of developing more than 200 diseases including liver cirrhosis and some cancers, according to the WHO. Dr Oleg Chestnov, WHO assistant director-general for non-communicable diseases and mental health, said there was 'no room for complacency'. 'More needs to be done to protect populations from the negative health consequences of alcohol consumption,' he said. On average, every person in the world aged 15 or older drinks 6.2 litres of pure alcohol per year. A map showing the amount of alcohol consumed by each country . But as less than half of the global population drinks, the WHO said those who do consume on average 17 litres of pure alcohol annually. Data showed that Australian males drank 19.7 litres on average, which was more than double the amount of women who drank nine litres. Alcohol disorders and addictions also affected more Australian men than women, with five percent of men having an issue compared to 2.1 percent of women. 'We found that worldwide about 16 per cent of drinkers engage in heavy episodic drinking - often referred to as 'binge drinking' - which is the most harmful to health,' Shekhar Saxena, WHO director for mental health and substance abuse, said. 'Lower income groups are more affected by the social and health consequences of alcohol. They often lack quality health care and are less protected by functional family or community networks.' Data showed that Australian males drank 19.7 litres on average, which was more than double the amount of women who drank nine litres . The report provided profiles on 194 countries, the impact on public health and policy responses. Some countries, including Australia, have already strengthened measures to protect people by increasing taxes on alcohol and regulating the marketing of alcoholic beverages, according to the WHO. The report shows that six percent of Australians who had previously been drinkers had curbed their drinking in 2009.","11 percent of Australians over 15 years are considered heavy drinkers .

"A woman was scarred for life after she was viciously attacked by two collies when she went to the aid of what she thought was an injured dog in the road. Catherine Buckley had a huge chunk bitten out of her right forearm after she was set upon by the two dogs in Scammonden, West Yorkshire. The 33-year-old had got out of her car on a country lane to usher one of the dogs from the middle of the road believing it to have been injured. Scarred: Ms Buckley, shows the healing scar on her arm following the attack . Horrific: Ms Buckley pictured with bandages covering her wounds following the attack, left, and the wound on her right forearm after a skin graft, right . But the dog, along with its companion turned on her, with one biting her arm and the other clamping its jaws around her thumb. Ms . Buckley, who heard other dogs barking and saw six more in a nearby . field, has had to undergo skin grafts and faces the prospect of further . cosmetic surgery following the attack. She said: 'It was terrifying. If the dogs had managed to drag me into the field I don't think I'd still be here. 'As I went to the dog, it jumped over a fence and into the field. The next thing I know, two dogs had jumped back over the fence and went for me. 'I was absolutely petrified. 'The dog who had my right forearm only let go once it had sunk its teeth all the way into my arm. I then took a swing for the other dog on my left hand to get it off of me.' One . of the dogs released its grip on her arm and she managed to fight off . the second dog before going back to her car with blood dripping from her . wounds. She claims the dogs . were housed in kennels which were not properly fenced off and police . are investigating it as a criminal matter. Painful: Ms Buckley also had to have five stitches in her thumb and hand . Ms . Buckley, who described the dogs as border collie cross breeds, was . taken by ambulance to Huddersfield Royal Infirmary for treatment. She was sent to Bradford Royal Infirmary the following day and was admitted overnight. She had skin grafted from her thigh to her right arm and a pot was fitted to help the healing process. Ms Buckley also needed five stitches to her left hand. Catherine, of Bailiff Bridge, West Yorkshire, was prescribed a course of antibiotics and painkillers and is still off work because of her injuries. 'The dogs could get out again and people ride bikes around there. I dread to think what would have happened if a child had been attacked.' Catherine Buckley . She said: 'They could easily have gone for my face or throat.' 'The dogs could get out again and people ride bikes around there. 'I dread to think what would have happened if a child had been attacked.' The owner of the dogs has been spoken to by police and Catherine has since returned to the scene to identify the dogs involved. She said: 'I've not had an apology yet and I was too scared to speak to the owner when I travelled back to the farmhouse with the police. 'He was co-operating with police but I don't think he realised how severe my injuries were.' Catherine has been told she will be permanently scarred and doctors will consider more cosmetic surgery in 12 months’ time. A spokesman for West Yorkshire Police confirmed that the matter is currently under investigation. He said: 'The victim sustained a hand injury which required hospital treatment and police have been investigating the incident which is being treated as a criminal matter. 'Police have now interviewed the owner of the dogs and arrangements have been put in place for the victim to identify the animals involved. Scene: Ms Buckley stopped on this road after seeing what she thought was an injured dog . One of the dogs on the farm close to where Ms Buckley was attacked . 'Guidance was given to the owner in the interim to keep the dogs secure on his land.' The investigation comes just a week after ministers proposed tougher new laws which could see owners of killer dogs jailed for life. The proposals, which the Government has put out to public consultation, would see dog owners jailed for a maximum of 10 years if their pet injures someone with the same penalty potentially incurred if it kills a guide dog. Under current laws, dog owners can only go to jail for up to two years. The proposals were outlined just months after 14-year-old Jade Anderson was killed by four dogs when visiting a friend  near Wigan, Greater Manchester. On average there are 210,000 dog attacks in the UK each year with 6,000 of those resulting in hospital treatment for the victim. Since 2005, 16 people have been mauled to death in dog attacks in the UK.","Catherine Buckley needed skin grafts after the attack in West Yorkshire .

"NBA legend Shaquille 'Shaq' O'Neal has prompted outrage by apparently posting an Instagram photo which mocked a man with a rare genetic condition. Jahmel Binion, whose ectodermal dysplasia hinders his ability to grow teeth and hair, was dumbfounded when thousands of internet users imitated and mocked a selfie he took. They included Shaq, who has now apparently deleted the Instagram photo - which said 'SMILE TODAY' - and uploaded one comparing himself to the cartoon ogre Shrek. Offensive: The photo was uploaded to the Instagram account of Shaquille O'Neal (left) comparing him to Jahmel Binion (right) - who has the rare genetic disorder ectodermal dysplasia. It has since been deleted . But the move was too late to stop a storm of comments from many of Shaq's 500,000 followers on Instagram and 8.3million on Twitter. The controversy comes after criticism of another top figure in basketball, billionaire LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling, who is embroiled in a racial discrimination row. Many Instagram and Twitter users today demanded Shaq apologised for the photo. And instead of hiding away, 23-year-old Mr Binion has used the publicity to start a campaign to raise awareness of his condition. Called Hug Don't Judge, a Facebook page for his campaign has gained more than 3,500 fans and been flooded with photos by parents whose children have the same disorder. The description reads: 'This page is to support my anti-bulling and cyber bullying organization. 'Please be respectful, be positive and share this with the world. Time to make a difference.' Mocked: Jahmel Binion (left) had ectodermal dysplasia since he was a baby (right) and has begun an anti-bullying campaign. He said he was disappointed by the NBA star because he saw him as a role model . Famous: NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal has more than 500,000 followers on Instagram and 8.3million on Twitter . Mr Binion, 23, told My Fox Detroit: 'I've been getting teased since I was yea tall - people laugh at me, stare at me. 'I . was kinda hurt because I look up to him and I watch Shaq play . basketball so I was like, why is he making fun of me when he's supposed . to be this role model?' 'I can't let it get to me, then I get hurt and depressed, so I keep my mind positive.' The storm prompted the National Foundation for Ectodermal Dysplasias to write an open letter to the NBA legend. Executive . director Mary Fete said there were more than 180 forms of the condition . and many left sufferers with missing teeth and unable to sweat. She wrote: 'You might want to consider . making something positive come from this.  Consider giving Jahmel . Binion the gift of a smile, one that others would not make fun of. 'Give him a smile that would give him confidence and pride.' Self-mockery: The four time NBA champion has since uploaded a photo comparing himself to Shrek . So far Shaq has not responded publicly to the row. Some . users rushed to the 7ft 1in four-time NBA champion's support, saying . people were too easily offended and Shaq may not have known Mr Binion . had a disibility. Anger: One Twitter user's response today . The controversy comes after another top figure in the NBA, billionaire LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling, made headlines when a tape of an alleged racist rant was leaked to TMZ. He is allegedly heard telling his girlfriend she can 'sleep with black people' but not bring them to matches. 'You can bring them in, you can do . whatever you want,' the voice on the tape says. 'The little I ask you is not to promote it on that... and not to bring them to my games. 'It bothers me a lot . that you want to broadcast that you’re associating with black people. Do you have to? 'I’m just saying, in your lousy f******* Instagrams, you don’t have to have yourself with, walking with black people. 'Don't . put him (Magic Johnson) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they . have to call me.  And don't bring him to my games.' In 2009 Sterling agreed to a $2.76 million settlement over claims he discriminated against African American and Latinos tenants at apartments he owned. He did not admit any liability. Campaign: Jahmel Binion's anti-bullying Facebook group Hug Don't Judge has already gained 3,500 members . Response: One of the reactions which the NBA star received to the row from his 8.3million followers . Politics: Another user highlighted the NBA star's support for New Jersey 'Bridgegate' governor Chris Christie . Abuse: Some Twitter users were more angry and one called Shaq a 'sad pathetic excuse for a man'. Others, however, defended him saying he may not have known Jahmel Binion had a disability . Dear Mr. O’Neal, . All of us at the National Foundation for Ectodermal Dysplasias (NFED) are terribly disappointed by the hurtful image that you and others recently posted on social media about a member of our family, Jahmel Binion, who is affected by ectodermal dysplasia. Individuals affected by these rare, genetic conditions often face a lifetime of bullying and negative remarks because of their appearance, which others may consider “different.”  Bullying is never acceptable and we, as a nation, have had some devastating consequences as a result of bullying. However, to be called out on a celebrity’s social media and made fun of is especially reprehensible.  We applaud Jahmel for reacting to this cyberbullying by establishing a positive social media campaign called “Hug Don’t Judge.” Mr. O’Neal, we welcome this opportunity to enlighten you about the ectodermal dysplasias and how we could work together for positive change. The ectodermal dysplasias are rare genetic conditions that affect the development of hair, teeth, skin, glands and nails in men, women and children of all races and ethnic groups.  Of the more than 180 different syndromes, x-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (XLHED) is the most common and features multiple malformed and missing teeth, the inability to perspire, sparse hair and recurring respiratory infections. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, but in all cases present a variety of challenges. We invite you to attend our NFED National Family Conference, July 23-26 in Columbus, Ohio, and meet families from around the world who, like Jahmel, are affected by ectodermal dysplasias.  You will meet some extraordinary people who are accomplishing profound acts despite the harsh social stigmas, daunting physical challenges, and financially draining dental procedures they’re up against. You might want to consider making something positive come from this.  Consider giving Jahmel Binion the gift of a smile, one that others would not make fun of.  Give him a smile that would give him confidence and pride. We are urging our NFED community to use this opportunity to raise awareness, to make positive change, and to support Jahmel’s “Hug Don’t Judge” campaign (#hugdontjudge). We encourage you to do the same.  Let’s raise awareness of the ectodermal dysplasias. Together, we have the power to make life better for the people it affects. Beauty is diverse. Let us show you. Sincerely, . Mary FeteExecutive Director .","NBA legend's 'offensive' photo caused outrage and was later deleted .

"One-eyed police killer Dale Cregan has had a £20,000 bounty placed on his remaining good eye by a criminal underworld boss who wants him attacked in prison. Police believe the violent underworld feud behind Cregan’s killing spree is far from over now he has been jailed for murdering Mark and David Short, as well as  PCs Nicola Hughes, 23, and Fiona Bone, 32. As the jury was considering its verdicts, Mark and David Short’s grave at Droylsden Cemetery was vandalised in a hammer attack. Pictures of the Shorts and flowers left by loved ones were scattered all over the plot. Scroll down for video . Victims: Dale Cregan murdered Mark Short (far right) at a birthday party in May and then killed his father David Short (next to his son) three months later - and a gang is said to want Cregan's other eye removed . Link: There is said to be huge anger that the joint grave of Mark and David Short was attacked and chipped (pictured) during Cregan's 17-week trial . It is understood the imprisoned head of a London crime family has now put out a £20,000 ‘contract’ on Cregan. The rival gang leader is said to be sympathetic to the Shorts, and has made the contract payable on the destruction of Cregan’s good right eye in prison. Cregan is starting his whole life sentence segregated from other prisoners because of the continuing threat to his safety. In his criminal life Cregan’s false black onyx eye became a badge of pride and a mark of his hardman image on the streets of East Manchester. He knew the false eye and the empty socket behind it – which had to be searched every time he came into court – looked menacing. Attack: The father and son's final resting place has been targeted with a hammer recently . Vandals: Whoever attacked the grave also left these photographs strewn across the cemetery . Criminal associates say he would use it to intimidate other drug dealers. But mystery surrounds how he lost his left eye. Some say it was badly damaged by a knuckleduster in a drunken bar-room brawl while others say it was knocked out in a fight with gangsters in Bangkok. But a police source said officers were suspicious of the stories because there is no marking or scar tissue around his eye socket. They suspect his eye may have been ‘plucked out’ by a knife-wielding crime rival. The source added: ‘He thought it made him look like a baddie out of a James Bond film. He was definitely looking for a dramatic image and this fulfilled it.’ First crime scene: The first victim, Mark Short, was killed at the Cotton Tree Inn pub in Droylsden at just before midnight . Images: Police took pictures of these walls . where Cregan's grenades pitted them with shrapnel and smashed nearby . window throwing glass everywhere . Cregan was subjected to twice-daily checks behind his false eye as part of the security operation surrounding his trial. During the trial, a source at HMP Manchester, better known as Strangeways, said: ‘Every time he comes in and every time he goes out of the building he must be searched and checked – including behind his eye. ‘Because he is a category A prisoner, each time he leaves these walls he is strip-searched and he must take his eye out so we can look behind it for drugs or some sort of weapon or anything he shouldn’t have. ‘And every time he comes back from court he gets strip-searched again and he has to take his eye out again – and it p****s him off.’ Cold-blooded: Cregan decided in advance he would kill the police, and eventually took lives of PC Fiona Bone (left) and PC Nicola Hughes (right) after calling 999 claiming there was a burglary where he was hiding . Cregan's use of grenades  during . his killing spree was ‘incredibly worrying’, said Sir Peter Fahy, Chief . Constable of Greater Manchester Police. He said: ‘It was military-style . weaponry – grenades from a former war zone. The worry is that there are . huge numbers of these weapons out there from other parts of the world . and it is relatively easy for certain individuals to import them into . this country.’ Sources revealed that hand grenades, . machine guns, bullets and even rockets were among a shocking array of . firepower available on the black market. Attack: Cregan emptied the magazine of this Glock handgun and then dumped it by the bodies of the officers he had just fatally injured . Extraordinary: Greater Manchester Police discovered this stash of  grenades inside a storm drain during Dale Cregan's 17-week trial . The ‘shopping list’ available to . criminals means they can buy grenades for as little as £150 each, while . semi-automatic handguns with bullets cost £250. Military-issue assault . rifles cost £500 to £1,000 while a magazine of bullets for the weapons . costs anything from £5 to £50. Grenades are the latest addition to the arsenal of criminals as they ramp up the ‘terror quotient’. Cregan had an arsenal of M75 hand . grenades and used four during his murderous spree which claimed the . lives of four people last year. Only last week police found a cache of ten grenades believed to be linked to Cregan at an address in Greater Manchester. Police say the grenades used by . Cregan came from the former Yugoslavia. The M75 is a fragmentation . grenade which has 3,000 tiny steel balls packed into its shell which . explode over a 50m radius. Police sources say the Yugoslavian grenades are available on Britain’s streets and are becoming a status symbol among criminals.","London crime boss said to have offered reward to attack Cregan in jail .

"Flu jabs can halve the risk of heart attacks in middle-aged men, according to a study. The vaccine is already given to people with chronic conditions, including heart disease. But researchers say the NHS should consider offering it to everyone from 50 to 64. The study examined hospital data for 559 patients over the age of 40, around half of whom had suffered a heart attack. Benefits: The flu vaccine could help cut the risk of a heart attack in middle-aged men by up to a half . Nose and throat swabs and blood samples were taken when the patients were admitted and again four to six weeks later. The results showed around one in eight of the heart attack patients had recently had flu, compared with just under 7 per cent in the comparison group. Half of all the patients had received the flu jab that year. Flu had not been diagnosed in around one in ten of those who had the infection, suggesting it may be missed in hospital patients who turn up with other problems, the Australian experts reported in the journal Heart. While the research showed that flu did not increase the risk of a heart attack, having the jab appeared to be protective. It cut the chance of having an attack by 45 per cent. Deadly: Previous research has suggested that the flu virus can cause blood to thicken or arteries to inflame . Previous research has shown that flu may encourage blood to thicken or prompt an inflammatory response in arteries that are already narrowed, which could lead to a blockage and a heart attack. But the report authors, from the University of New South Wales in Sydney, said: ‘Even a small effect of influenza vaccination in preventing (heart attacks) may have significant population health gains.’ Thembi Nkala, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘The flu can lead to serious illness, so getting your flu jab is vital if you have, or are at risk of, heart disease. It’s why many heart patients who are deemed at high risk are already offered the vaccination as a matter of routine.’ Dr John Watson, head of the respiratory diseases department at Public Health England, said: ‘We welcome this interesting research on the flu vaccination’s effects. ‘The study results are a timely reminder that susceptible patients should have their flu jab this winter.’","Researchers say NHS should consider giving it to everyone aged 50 to 64 .

"Samsung has filed papers claiming that Apple's latest iPad mini, released this month, infringes eight technology patents . Samsung has filed papers at a US court claiming that Apple's latest iPad mini, released this month, infringes eight technology patents. Korean giant Samsung has asked a judge to add the 7.9-inch Apple tablet to a list of products, including the iPod Touch 5, and the iPad 4, which it claims violate patents on radio signalling technologies. A patent war has engulfed technology giants with firms trying to make sure the others’ latest products are involved in the legal dispute in a bid get sales banned. The rivals have filed cases against each other in more than 10 countries, each accusing the other of violating its patents. Last week Apple successfully applied to add Google’s latest mobile operating system, Android 4.2, Jelly Bean, to the case. In a minor victory for Samsung, on Wednesday, the judge ordered Apple to disclose the financial details of its patent licensing deal with HTC. Apple and HTC signed a 10-year licence agreement earlier this month, but did not make the details public. But the court ordered Apple to produce a full copy of the settlement . agreement 'without delay', subject to an 'attorneys' eyes only' designation, meaning it will not be made public. Legal experts say the question of which patents are covered by the HTC settlement, and licensing details, could be instrumental in Samsung's efforts to thwart Apple's subsequent quest for a permanent sales ban on its products. Samsung has argued it is 'almost certain' that the HTC deal covers some of the same patents involved in its own litigation with Apple. It seeks to show Apple is willing to license its technology if the price is right. It has been speculated that HTC has agreed to pay Apple a royalty of up to $8 on each smartphone it sells, but the figure has been flatly denied by the firm’s chief executive. The settlement of Apple and HTC ended their worldwide litigation and brought to a close one of the first major flare-ups in the global smartphone patent wars. Apple first sued HTC in 2010, setting in motion a legal conflagration that has since circled the globe and engulfed the biggest names in mobile technology.

"It is fair to say Leeds United fans are not exactly cock-a-hoop over David Hockaday. How does a man sacked from Forest Green Rovers in the Conference Premier after losing seven of eight games next land the main job at arguably the biggest club outside the Premier League? Confused, and not a little angry, Leeds supporters can be forgiven for never having heard Hockaday’s name before Italian owner Massimo Cellino plucked him from obscurity. Glad to be here: David Hockaday poses with Leeds United Massimo Cellino after being appointed head coach . Shock: Hockoday is the former Forest Green manager, but has been handed a two-year deal at Elland Road . BORN: Sedgefield, November 9 1957 (age 56) PLAYING CAREER: . 1975-1983: Blackpool (147 apps, 24 goals) 1983-1990: Swindon (245 apps, 7 goals) 1990-1993: Hull City (72 apps, 2 goals) 1993: Stoke City (loan) (7 apps, 0 goals) 1993-1995: Shrewsbury (48 apps, 0 goals) MANAGING AND COACHING CAREER: . 2000-2005: Watford U18 coach . 2005-2007: Watford first-team coach . 2007: Milton Keynes Dons coach . 2007: Leicester City coach . 2007-2009: Southampton youth team coach . 2009-2013: Forest Green Rovers . 2014-NOW: Leeds United head coach . Forest Green was Hockaday’s managerial debut and the team ended his first season in the relegation places, only to be saved by Salisbury City getting punished with demotion instead for financial irregularities. Another season of struggle followed before Ecotricity owner Dale Vince completed a takeover and supplied Hockaday with the division’s healthiest budget. Despite this the side finished 10th in consecutive seasons and by this campaign the 56-year-old was receiving abuse from the stands. During a 4-1 defeat to Kidderminster last October his own supporters sung: ‘F*** off Dave Hockaday’ and ‘You’re getting sacked in the morning’. He managed two more defeats before being given his P45. But there is another side to that story. Some observers felt the style of football he implemented – 4-3-3, passing – was commendable but players were simply not adequately skilled. Such tactics might work with a Championship squad. Also, while he possessed big-name players at non-league level accusations were levelled that once they had their pay cheques performing on a Saturday came secondary. Mentality was the problem. Still, it was Hockaday’s responsibility to motivate. An ability to developing players on the coaching field is what Leeds have trumpeted and his roles at Watford and Southampton are testament to that. Experience: Hockaday (left) during his time as assistant at Watford in 2005 with manager Adrian Boothroyd . Watford won promotion to the top-flight in 2006 with Hockaday on the staff. He had joined with Graham Taylor manager in 2000 as Under-18 coach and brought through Ashley Young among others. But Bothroyd replaced Hockaday with Malky Mackay in January 2007 as the team struggled in and he was also dismissed from Southampton two years later. His playing career was largely spent at Swindon Town and Blackpool playing as right-back. This appointment by Cellino is as left-field as they come.

"One of the secrets of migraines has been unlocked by a scientist who resolved to find a cure for the condition when it struck her down as a child. Emily Bates has discovered a gene that could lead to new and better treatments for the unpredictable and pounding headaches that blight the lives of millions. As a teenager, she had her schoolwork and athletics training disrupted by migraines. Now a 36-year-old professor of chemistry, she said: ‘I had migraines really frequently and severely. I would lose my vision, vomit uncontrollably – it would wipe out an entire day. Professor Emily Bates, of Brigham Young University in Utah, vowed to find a cure for migraines when she was affected by it as a child . ‘I decided then as a high school student that I was going to work on migraines, that I was going to figure them out and help find a cure.’ Professor Bates, of Brigham Young University in Utah, is part of a team of US scientists who have found the first gene involved in typical migraines. The scientists first studied the genetics of two families of migraine sufferers. This allowed them to pinpoint a common genetic flaw. To check that the gene is key to migraines, they then studied mice carrying the same genetic fault. Lead researcher Louis Ptáček, of University of California, San Francisco, said: ‘Obviously, we can’t measure a headache in a mouse but there are other things that go along with a migraine that we can measure.’ Experiments showed the mice, like people with migraines, to be extra-sensitive to pain, touch, sound and light. Scientists have discovered a gene that could unlock the secrets of migraines . The mutant mice were also more prone to a pattern of brain waves linked to the flashing lights or other visual problems that can precede a migraine. Giving the mice migraine drugs seemed to ease some of their symptoms, the journal Science Translational Medicine reports. Working out just how the flaw in a gene called casein kinase I delta causes migraines could lead to improved treatments. Professor Ptáček said existing drugs ‘only help some patients, some of the time’. He added: ‘This is the first gene in which mutations have been shown to cause a very typical form of migraine. It’s our initial glimpse into a black box that we don’t yet understand. ‘As we come to a clearer understanding, we can start to think about better therapies. The need for better treatments is huge.’ Peter Goadsby, a professor of neurology and medical trustee of the Migraine Trust in the UK, described the work as an ‘exciting new development in understanding migraine’. Professor Andrew Charles, a researcher from the University of California, Los Angeles, said:  ‘There simply hasn’t been enough attention paid to migraine as a major cause of disability worldwide. Compared to other common medical problems relatively little research has been done on the cause of migraine and its potential treatments. ‘We desperately need a better understanding of the condition and new treatments so that we are better able to help these many people whose lives are devastated by the disorder.’ It is hoped the gene, which is also involved in the control of sleep, will also shed light on links between sleeping too much and too little and the onset of migraines. Migraines feature in the World Health Organisation’s top 20 most disabling lifetime conditions and affect one in four women and one in 12 men.","Professor Emily Bates decided as a child she wanted to find a cure .

"This mystical beacon of light shining through the arch looks like it has come straight out of an Indiana Jones film. But rather than be created with special effects, the orange glow is a natural phenomenon that only occurs during a few weeks of every year. Capturing the stunning and rare light on camera is one of biggest trophies for nature photographers in the U.S. The almost supernatural light at Keyhole Arch in Pfeiffer Beach, California, acts like a magnet to photographers desperate to capture its stunning glow . The mystical light looks like it has been created with special effects and combined with the mist on the rocks and water could be straight out of an Indiana Jones film . The rays occur in the weeks surrounding Winter Solstice when the sun sets at the perfect level behind the arch on Pfeiffer Beach, California. The arch is known as Keyhole Arch or Pfeiffer Arch and acts as a magnet to professional and amateur photographers from all over the world. The glorious light happens when the sun sets directly behind the opening and when the tide is high enough to reflect the light perfectly.

Photographer Mark Brodkin waded into the water to get the perfect shot of the light that only occurs for a few weeks every year . The amazing light in Keyhole Arch attracts hundreds of photographers every year desperate to capture its stunning glow. It occurs in the weeks surrounding winter solstice when the sun sets directly behind the arch. The tide must also be high enough for the light to reflect off its surface. The sky must also be clear on the horizon. Some photographers maintain it must be captured at a 35 degree angle for the perfect shot. The arch is a natural formation and measures about 20ft by 20ft. The special beam of light only lasts for about five minutes before the sun finally sets. Its brevity means that photographers . are forced to jostle for position on the beach to get the correct angle - . approximately 35 degrees.

"Russian president Vladimir Putin met the . Pope today - amid claims he is planning to name scandal-mired Silvio . Berlusconi as Russia's ambassador to the Vatican. The pair have defended each other through thick and thin, so the move is hardly surprising for the ever-controversial pair. The Russian president has attended the Italian’s infamous bunga bunga parties while Mr Putin reciprocated with holidays at his dacha on the Black Sea. Friends: It has been claimed Vladimir Putin, left, who met the Pope in Rome's Vatican City, reportedly wants to make disgraced Silvio Berlusconi, right, a Russian ambassador - giving him diplomatic immunity . Pope Francis shakes hand with Russian President Vladimir Putin as they exchange gifts during the private audience at the Vatican City . They have attended extreme fighting events together and Mr Putin even has a bed named after him at the 77-year-old billionaire’s mansion. Now their unlikely bond has taken a new turn, with Mr Putin said to be poised to make the former Italian prime minister the Russian envoy to the Vatican. Such a move would confer diplomatic immunity on Berlusconi – and an escape from his latest legal woes courtesy of his old pal in the Kremlin. After being convicted of tax fraud, the politician is this week facing expulsion from the Italian parliament, a move that would strip him of some legal protection. Putin is on a two-day visit in Italy. He will also meet with Italian President Giorgio Napolitano and Premier Enrico Letta . In September the Pope wrote directly to Putin imploring him to co-operate with other international leaders to help the people of Syria . The three-time premier had hoped for a last minute pardon but Italian President Giorgio Napolitano has made it clear that this is not on his agenda. He is also appealing against a conviction  for sex with underage prostitute Ruby ‘the heart-stealer’, and faces a new trial for an alleged £2.5million bribe to a senator. As well as legal immunity, the  post would give Berlusconi a diplomatic passport, allowing him to visit his luxury overseas properties – something he has been denied since his old passport was  cancelled by the authorities. Putin kisses the gift he presented to Pope Francis during the private audience at the Vatican City . Although the two have clashed over Syria, they agree that outside military intervention will escalate the civil war . Former KGB agent Mr Putin was last night arriving in Rome to meet Pope Francis and Italian ministers but he is also scheduled to meet Berlusconi. A political source told an Italian newspaper: ‘Putin’s idea is clear: he plans to nominate Berlusconi as ambassador to the Holy See, a strategy that would save him from persecution by the judiciary.’ Mr Putin held private talks with Pope Francis about the Syrian conflict, months after the Pope sent him an angry letter criticising the G20's failure to provide more aid. In . September the Pope wrote directly to Putin imploring him to co-operate . with other international leaders to help the people of Syria. Cosy: Berlusconi and Putin are firm friends, despite both being controversial figures on the world stage . Friends: The pair during a mid-air meeting in April 2004. Since then Berlusconi has been given several jail terms . So far the reports that Putin, left, could make Berlusconi, right, a Russian ambassador are unconfirmed . Pope Francis and Putin did agree on one thing, however - they were both against the British and U.S. push for military intervention. Putin refused to take sides in the conflict, while the Pope said it was important that the violence did not escalate. But the pair differ publicly in several areas including on gay rights. While the Pope has reportedly taken a softer line, Putin has cracked down on gay rights and criminalised protests in favour. And there is a long-running religious feud between the Vatican and the Russian Orthodox church, which have been at loggerheads since the fall of the Soviet Union. Russian church figures have accused the Vatican of trying to convert their worshippers to make them Catholic.","Putin will hold fiery discussion of Syria with Pope Francis .

"A dossier detailing explosive claims of sex abuse by paedophiles within Westminster has gone missing. Given to Home Secretary Leon Brittan in 1983, the files allegedly exposed a vile network at Parliament and Whitehall. But there is no record of any subsequent criminal inquiry and the Home Office yesterday admitted the dossier is either lost or destroyed. Scroll down for video . A dossier detailing explosive claims of sex abuse by paedophiles within Westminster has gone missing. Given to Home Secretary Leon Brittan in 1983, the files allegedly exposed a vile network at Parliament and Whitehall . Lord Brittan, 74, is now facing questions over his handling of the document and inconsistencies in his account of what he did with it. The Tory peer told journalists last year he had no recollection of being given the dossier. But in a statement yesterday morning, he changed his mind. He confirmed he was handed a ‘substantial bundle of papers’ by MP Geoffrey Dickens in November 1983 and passed them to his officials for further investigation. He said: ‘I do not recall being contacted further about these matters by Home Office officials or by Mr Dickens or by anyone else.’ Hours later Lord Brittan amended his account again after proof emerged that he had written to Mr Dickens in March 1984 informing him the dossier had been assessed by prosecutors and handed to police. Home Office officials say they have searched for the dossier but cannot find it. Last night Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who has challenged Lord Brittan to explain how he dealt with the allegations, demanded to know what police had done with the information provided by the late Mr Dickens. The Tory peer told journalists last year he had no recollection of being given the dossier. But in a statement yesterday morning, he changed his mind. He confirmed he was handed a 'substantial bundle of papers' by MP Geoffrey Dickens (pictured) in November 1983 and passed them to his officials for further investigation . He said: ‘Why would you destroy such an important document? What action was taken? Were any prosecutions forthcoming? We need to know this. It’s raising more questions than it is answers. Many people will think it has been destroyed to protect the people whose names were in it.’ In his second statement yesterday, Lord Brittan said he had acted properly and the dossier had been fully followed up. Mr Danczuk said: ‘To hear a former Home Secretary dismiss evidence from Geoffrey Dickens, a member of his own party who has a strong track record in campaigning on this issue, in such a casual, procedural manner is extremely worrying. ‘The impression conveyed is that Sir Leon does not want to talk about this. It goes right to the heart of an attitude in politics that child abuse is a subject best avoided. He should reveal what he knew at the time about paedophile networks and what action he took.’ The Rochdale MP – who helped expose the full extent of Liberal MP Sir Cyril Smith’s paedophile attacks in a book earlier this year, serialised by the Daily Mail – is calling for a Hillsborough-style inquiry into child abuse allegations against politicians. Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who has challenged Lord Brittan to explain how he dealt with the allegations, demanded to know what police had done with the information provided by the late Mr Dickens . A lawyer representing alleged victims of abuse at the south-west London Elm Guesthouse reportedly named in the dossier, criticised the loss of the document. Alison Millar, head of the abuse team at Leigh Day, said: ‘My clients are incredulous at how this dossier can have simply disappeared. It seems inconceivable that a document of such importance can have simply disappeared. ‘I would strongly support the calls for a widespread inquiry into historic sexual abuse so that my clients could have their many questions answered about who knew what and that a very troubling veil is lifted from the corridors of power.’ The Prime Minister’s official spokesman declined to back Mr Danczuk’s demands for an over-arching inquiry – a call which has garnered the support of 120 MPs. The Rochdale MP - who helped expose the full extent of Liberal MP Sir Cyril Smith's (pictured) paedophile attacks in a book earlier this year, serialised by the Daily Mail - is calling for a Hillsborough--style inquiry into child abuse allegations against politicians . He said independent inquiries were already under way into allegations relating to the BBC and the NHS. But when asked whether there should be an independent inquiry into allegations of Westminster paedophile rings, he referred to last year’s Home Office review. Asked to comment on the Dickens dossier, Scotland Yard said last night: ‘The Metropolitan Police is currently assessing information and conducting a number of investigations under Operation Fairbank. Any material submitted to us, historic or current, is reviewed to establish if it is relevant to these.’ Tim Loughton, former children’s minister, told Channel 4 News: ‘In order to restore confidence in our child protection system, because things have got a lot better, we need an overarching inquiry that puts all this into context and makes recommendations so we can make sure we have a child protection service that is fit for purpose. ‘The victims must come first. And those many victims, many hundreds if not thousands who have been suffering often in silence going back to the 60s, 70s, 80s who have been emboldened to come forward. At last we are listening to them and their stories are being taken seriously but we need to find out why they weren’t taken seriously when these offences happened.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Lord Brittan, 74, is facing questions over handling of 'explosive' document .

"A special needs student convicted of disorderly conduct for recording his alleged bullies while they tormented him, is appealing the ruling and suing the school district. Christian Stanfield, 15, said he recorded his classmates in February to show his mother the extent to which he was being harassed at Pennsylvania's South Fayette High School. But when school officials found out about the tape, they forced the learning-disabled student to delete it and reported the 'wiretapping incident' to police. On March 19, a judge found Stanfield guilty of disorderly conduct and fined him $25 plus court costs. His mother, Shea Love, wants to know why her son, and not his alleged bullies, was punished. 'The whole thing has been a horrible nightmare,' the 40-year-old told Tribune-Review. 'This whole ordeal has made my son miserable.' Defending himself: Christian Stanfield, 15 (right) said he filmed his classmates allegedly bullying him in February to show his mother, Shea Love (left), the extent to which he was being harassed . Tribune-Review obtained a copy of the court minutes, including a transcript of the seven-minute recording Stanfield made. In the video, one student can be heard telling another to pull Stanfield's pants down. The teacher can be heard intervening, telling the students that they need to stop talking if their discussion isn't about math. A few minutes later, a loud slam can be heard, followed by the teacher telling students to sit down. 'What? I was just trying to scare him,' one of the boys can be heard saying.

Stanfield - who has been diagnosed with a comprehension delay disorder, ADHD, and an anxiety disorder - told the court he made the recording 'because I always felt like it wasn’t me being heard'. 'I wanted some help,' he said. 'This wasn’t just a one-time thing. This always happens every day in that class.' The teen testified that . students slammed books across his head, His mother told the court that classmates threw 'spitwads' at her . son. 'They were calling him some really bad names, talking about pulling his pants down,' Love told WPXI in March.

"Girls in aristocratic circles have long attended finishing schools to polish their manners, their deportment and their accents. Wealthy families in the UK have traditionally sent their fledgling society ladies off to schools to learn the intricacies of a thoroughbred upbringing - both Princess Diana and the Duchess of Cornwall both attended finishing schools in Switzerland - but it is not a solely British preserve. Indeed, wealthy women in China are so eager to emulate the manners of the aristocracy that they are willing to spend thousands of pounds on finishing schools to help them get there. Founder of Institute Sarita Sarah Jane Ho making a cup of tea in a room in Beijing, where she teaches women how to properly peel an orange, hold an oyster fork, and pronounce luxury brand names . The new Institute Sarita in Beijing describes itself as ‘China’s leading finishing school, bringing you first-hand experience to help you become more poised and polished, taking your social and professional success to the next level.’ Stemming from the massive influx of wealth in China in the last decades and the new cultural revolution, the notoriously polite Chinese are travelling globally and wanting to make the right impression. Sarah Jane Ho's courses cost up to £10,400 for two weeks of training, and vary according to marital status .

The courses go into incredible detail on every possible scenario a woman may come across in social situations, from peeling an orange to eating a oyster. The lessons even cover how to pronounce the names of luxury design houses. The . Debutante course lasts for 10 days and promises to teach single women .

It also teaches the history, tasting and service of tea and coffee, alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, dressing definitions, personal stationery and invitation cards, body language, rules of official and diplomatic protocol, and hotel and restaurant manners. The Institute states that: 'Our courses are designed to give you the opportunity to achieve a greater understanding of other cultures and better interpersonal communication. 'Every principle discussed is well supported by practice, so that being an elegant lady or confident business executive becomes second nature to you.'

"Their lyrics include the line 'don't need make-up' but that hasn't stopped boyband One Direction from capitalising on their female fans' adulation by launching a cosmetics range. Despite twittering about their love of unadorned ladies in their hit single What Makes You Beautiful ('Don't need make-up to cover up, being the way that you are is enough', go the lyrics), the teen hearthrobs have unveiled the 'Little Things' beauty range, which will sell for pocket money prices.

Nailed it: Each of the five polishes is chosen by a band member, and include green for Liam Payne and hot pink for Harry Styles . The Lip Polish products come in a different colour and flavour for every band member and are available in Harry loves Strawberry, Zayn loves Watermelon, Louis loves Vanilla, Niall loves Cherry and Liam loves Blueberry. Meanwhile, the 'Kiss You' Lipstick range is named after their songs, with shades that include 'Be Mine', 'Moments', 'I Wish', 'Rock Me' and 'I Want'. Last but not least, the boys have each put their face to a different shade of nail polish, with Harry Styles plumping for hot pink and Liam Payne choosing emerald green. Lipsticks and lip polishes come decorated with autographs, while polish bottles come with plectrum charms featuring photographs of One Direction band members. They were quick to comment on MUA's official website, gushing, 'I just screamed a little bit' and making jokes such as, 'Harry Styles' colour should be called Cougar Crimson.' Fans have been tweeting about the range too, and despite some initial scepticism, the reception has been generally warm. One wrote: 'I'm a fan of 1D but when I first heard about this I was like ""eurgh, typical"" but these actually seem quite cute!

"It is already used to share almost every aspect of our lives with friends. But today, Facebook added a new feature, letting expectant parents share their good news with friends. The new feature, which is available to all users who have switched to Facebook's 'Timeline' profile, lets users share their unborn child's name, expected birth date and gender.

"A Chinese blogger who was accused of spreading rumours about the government and celebrities has been jailed for three years for 'rumour mongering'. Marketing employee Qin Zhihui, 30, is believed to be the first person to be jailed since China's authorities announced a crackdown on online writers last August. Authorities claimed a false post he wrote about a foreign victim of a 2011 train crash receiving £24million in compensation was reposted more than 11,000 times and commented on more than 3,000 times, inciting anger against the government. Jailed: Qin Zhijun is led into court today in Beijing. He did not make a defence, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. China adopted draconian measures to crack down on online 'rumours' last year . Qin, from Hunan province, was also found guilty of spreading rumors . about several celebrities including popular television hostess Yang Lan, . the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Chaoyang District People's Court heard the rumours were spread in 2012 and 2013 through Sina Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. China adopted draconian measures to crack . down on online rumours last year. People will be charged with defamation . if posts that contain 'rumours' are visited by 5,000 internet users or . reposted more than 500 times, according to a judicial interpretation . issued by China's top court and prosecutor. Confession: Qin issued a warning to other bloggers . Three years in jail is the maximum sentence. Qin Zhihui, known as Qinhuohuo in cyberspace, was arrested last August and accused of impacting society and seriously harming social order with his posts, according to Xinhua. But he made a confession to the court - and if he had not, would have been sentenced even more harshly. 'I don't want to defend myself,' he said, according to the South China Morning Post. 'I just want to say that I hope my experience is a lesson to other microbloggers.' The court heard he exploited sensational cases like one of a Red Cross staffer with a lavish lifestyle to drive web traffic, the Morning Post added. Other cases have also arisen. Today a Chinese-American venture capitalist known for his controversial blogs was released on bail after nearly eight months in detention because of a 'serious illness'. Charles Xue, also known as Xue Manzi, was detained in August on a charge of visiting prostitutes, an accusation that activists said stemmed from China's efforts to rein in social media. His release came the morning after state television showed him making a confession and apologising to his wife and children. China's crackdown on online 'rumour-mongering' is widely seen as a tool to halt criticism of the ruling Communist Party. It has chilled political debate, with high-profile bloggers saying they have reined in sensitive posts for fear of detention. The government claims the crackdown is necessary to preserve social stability.

"Leeds United in the 21st century is synonymous with upheaval and uncertainty, but even by this once proud club’s recent standards, Massimo Cellino has ratcheted things up to another level. The convicted fraudster, as ruthless as he is charismatic, has swept into Elland Road and not so much taken an axe to the mess he inherited but a machine gun — obliterating waste and leaving plenty of collateral damage. Cellino sees himself as the saviour of a club losing £1million a month. ‘Loose cannon,’ is how others familiar with the Italian’s ways describe him. VIDEO Scroll down to watch a hilarious chant from a Leeds United fan . Tricky business: Leeds United (Michael Tonge pictured) have gone through a period of sustained change . Cantankerous: New owner Massimo Cellino is one to take swift decisions and doesn't suffer fools . VIDEO Leeds owner plans to buy Elland Road . A Sportsmail investigation into his uncompromising reign, including a lengthy interview with the 58-year-old owner, reveals a fearsome cost-cutter who makes many of his decisions based on impulse and superstition as much as through forensic analysis. Our findings include: . Hard bargain: Cellino isn't afraid of pulling out of deals for players if they aren't right for the football club . Superstition and serious business acumen are mangled together when it comes to Cellino. In a 90-minute telephone conversation, the Italian only highlights and heightens the contradictions that make up his character. He is disarmingly candid and yet deviously secretive; he can produce quiet charm then explode in anger; he can reel off numbers like a maths boffin and also swear like a trooper. Some questions and challenges bounce off him no matter how insistent; others result in an unstoppable 10-minute answer. And he has expert timing with comic one-liners. While there is much speculation about the finances and running of Leeds, it is Cellino’s comments about Hockaday, plucked from obscurity having been sacked as manager of non-league Forest Green Rovers, which prove most interesting. The squad are believed to be supportive of an amiable man who is implementing a passing style that has seen steady improvement in pre-season form. And he's gone! Leeds sold star striker Ross McCormack to Fulham at the beginning of the summer . But Cellino, known in Italy as a mangiallenatori — a manager eater — after dismissing 36 in 22 years in charge of Cagliari, will not hesitate to act if things are not to his liking. Cellino said: ‘I had more or less 50 coaches in my existence, they are all the same. I used to have a boat, I used to pay the captain of the boat. You know what my strategy was? If he doesn’t do what I like to do with my boat, then I can drive my boat on my own. ‘I put myself always in a position to be free and to run a company the way I like, because I use my face, my name, my credibility. If they don’t do what I like to do — I do on my own!’ It is clear player recruitment is out of Hockaday’s hands. Consultant Graham Bean, the former FA compliance officer, and sporting director Nicola Salerno assist Cellino in spotting potential signings. It’s a complicated recruitment structure, and some connected with the club have reservations. Chesterfield centre back Liam Cooper, for example, was chased after Salerno watched him play just once, in a pre-season draw against Leeds. Then negotiations broke down over money. Hockaday, paid between £80-90,000 compared to the £750,000 salary his predecessor McDermott had earned, wanted a 31-year-old defender available on a free, but Cellino refused. ‘He has asked me about five or six players,’ said the Italian before unintentionally damning his new manager: ‘Don’t forget where he came from; league five. ‘Talking with managers of Premier League clubs, Championship clubs, is a new thing. He’s like a baby, who is in a toy shop.’ Thanks for coming! Cellino sacked Brian McDermott shortly after taking over at Elland road . Deals on the brink of completion are prone to collapse as Cellino applies a tough stance with agents and players. Roma’s Federico Viviani looked set to join, but is understood to have then made too many demands of the club’s straight-talking owner. Five players have, however, joined from Italy and there is some excitement about their potential. Cellino prefers to agree to smaller fees initially before paying in full if moves are a success. Forward Souleymane Doukara cost £500,000 for this year, but will cost an additional £1.5m to buy next summer. Player contracts are heavily incentivised. But there would appear to be one substantial barrier to any player signing for Cellino: a birthday on the 17th of the month. Cellino has thought the number unlucky since suffering a car accident in his twenties that came on Friday 17th and involved a vehicle with 17 in the registration plate. Saving money is Cellino’s prime focus. ‘I didn’t sleep for six months,’ Cellino said. ‘This club cost £125,000 per day — 365 bloody days a year! Every day I find a new surprise. We don’t own even one bloody chair!’ His biggest financial saving to date, however, has been in renegotiating with former majority owners Gulf Finance House over how much the Italian would ultimately pay for his 75 per cent share. Under the terms of the contract, Cellino agreed to buy the club for £11m and also service debts of £24m, much owed to GFH or associates of the Middle Eastern bank. But after studying the accounts, Sportsmail can reveal, Cellino threatened to take legal action against GFH before convincing them to restructure the deal. In our conversation, he declined to go into exact figures, but did say: ‘The issue was very strange. The numbers, they were not true. GFH were not able to understand what they were talking about. They were not even able to run a fruit shop. ‘When I bought the club it was technically bankrupt. I met GFH and told them, “We need to stop fighting. If not, we go to war with the lawyers.” They agreed. Respect? New manager David Hockaday doesn't seem to have much say when it comes to Cellino . ‘I don’t like to see the blood. It’s better if you get what you want without fighting. In six months I spent £1.5m on lawyers. Now GFH have 25 per cent of a company worth 10 times what it was before.’ In a dark and mysterious sideshow, the former Leeds managing director David Haigh is spending his third month in a Dubai police cell without interview by investigators, having been arrested on suspicion of embezzlement during his time at GFH. He denies all charges and friends are concerned there is a link between his statements about possessing damaging evidence against GFH and his incarceration. Cellino promised to purchase Elland Road as soon as he took over but was swamped by unforeseen payments elsewhere and the wrangle with GFH. The £11m sale of Ross McCormack could be used and he has pledged to pay £16m before November. Cellino’s sale of the club’s best player has enraged fans, but he has a different view of events. He explained: ‘Ross McCormack is a beautiful player. I didn’t come to Leeds to sell Ross McCormack. But for him I was nothing, a new owner, he’s got a lot of money from Fulham, the chance to live in London. What can I say? I love you McCormack, stay with me? ‘He doesn’t give a f***. He didn’t show up to training. He didn’t fly with the club to pre-season. I was so p***** off that when Fulham called me I asked them for £10m to make them not buy the player. They said yes! Bloody hell. That's a long time ago now! Leeds were in the Champions League semi-finals back in 2001 . ‘David Hockaday, the first day he heard McCormack wanted to go he said, “I don’t want him in pre- season, sell him”. I told Hockaday, “Did I ask your f****** advice? No. So shut the f*** up”.’ Gary Cooper, chairman of the Leeds United Supporters Trust with some 10,000 members, says surveys showed Cellino is popular among fans for his uncompromising attitude and approach to sorting business. He is also a frequent visitor to nearby pubs and will happily chat to locals. But Cooper is concerned that recent attempts to engage in serious dialogue on important issues have been met with silence. He said: ‘If Cellino doesn’t fulfil that November deadline then more and more of the fans will question his credibility.’ Cellino also predicts a battle to get out of the remarkable contract on the club’s Thorp Arch training facility, locking Leeds into total payments of a further £9m. Because of the cost-cutting, only around six staff attend Thorp Arch daily, including Hockaday. It has been described as a ‘ghost town’ by regulars. The chef has been dismissed, and food is driven up from the restaurant at Elland Road. Some players prefer to bring their own supplies to training. Despite the chaos and uncertainty, morale among the squad is understood to be positive. The match at Millwall on Saturday is a daunting task, particularly for those new boys from Italy. Cellino will expect victory. He is a man who likes numbers and none more so than the three points on offer in the season’s opener.","Cellino took over the club from GFH Capital .

The ship set sail on its 11,067 mile maiden voyage from the Chinese port of Yantian last month. It stopped off at Port Kelang in Malaysia to load more cargo before passing through the Suez canal. With a multi-national crew of just 31 on board, the ship arrived into the Suffolk port at about 1pm today, escorted by four tugs which helped to toe and nudge the ship into position across two berths. The largest ship to have previously docked at Felixstowe was the Maersk Triple-E, which arrived in November with about 18,000 containers. The green-hulled CSCL Globe was almost full to capacity with most of the containers double-sized 40ft units which can be towed by lorries.

Other containers were full of food and electronic equipment while 42 were packed with books, 11 contained flooring, 15 were full of bathroom fittings and ten were crammed with bedding. The ship is said to be carrying only a small number of electronic goods due to British retailers having already imported so many just before Christmas to cater for the festive season. Another 3,909 containers are due to be loaded on to the ship, operated by the China Shipping Container Line, to replace those being taken off. Only one in five will actually carry British goods, such as precision engineering products, automotive parts and luxury UK items for overseas markets.

Alan Newell, general manager of the firm's UK subsidiary China Shipping UK Agency, said: 'Our aim is to provide a modern, fast and efficient shipping service for consumers. 'We have worked and planned for the arrival of this ship at Felixstowe for a long time.

"Former Forest Green Rovers manager Dave Hockaday has been named as the new head coach of Leeds United. The two-year deal at Elland Road comes after Brian McDermott left at the end of May, and the 56-year-old's first game will be against Millwall on the opening day of the new Championship season. The former Blackpool and Swindon right-back has been out of the game since October last year after spending four years as boss of Conference outfit Forest Green, before leaving by mutual consent. Glad to be here: David Hockaday poses with Leeds United Massimo Cellino after being appointed head coach . Shock: Hockoday is the former Forest Green manager, but has been handed a two-year deal at Elland Road . BORN: Sedgefield, November 9 1957 (age 56) PLAYING CAREER: . 1975-1983: Blackpool (147 apps, 24 goals) 1983-1990: Swindon (245 apps, 7 goals) 1990-1993: Hull City (72 apps, 2 goals) 1993: Stoke City (loan) (7 apps, 0 goals) 1993-1995: Shrewsbury (48 apps, 0 goals) MANAGING AND COACHING CAREER: . 2000-2005: Watford U18 coach . 2005-2007: Watford first-team coach . 2007: Milton Keynes Dons coach . 2007: Leicester City coach . 2007-2009: Southampton youth team coach . 2009-2013: Forest Green Rovers . 2014-NOW: Leeds United head coach . Hockaday, who left Forest Green after losing seven out of eight league games, will have former Leicester City midfielder Junior Lewis as his assistant. 'I wasn't surprised to get the call because I'd spoken to lots of people and when I met the president (Massimo Cellino) and he talked it was very obvious he knew what he was talking about,' Hockaday said about getting the Leeds role. 'It happened and it seemed right and he offered me the job and I accepted.' Hockaday, who said the club had players lined up to strengthen the squad and that Ross McCormack would not be sold, added: . 'I can eulogise as long as I want about a club the size of Leeds, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating. 'I've been given a great opportunity and I'm going to take this opportunity with both hands and one thing nobody can ever accuse me of is a lack of hard work and I believe I'm a good coach. 'The president believes I'm a good coach and people out there who have obviously recommended me believe I'm a good coach and I'm going to prove that.' A statement on the club's website said Hockaday 'will assume overall responsibility for the coaching staff and first team playing squad with immediate effect'. Leeds' Italian owner, . Massimo Cellino, who completed his takeover on April 7, faced an angry backlash from fans on Monday. Experience: Hockaday (left) during his time as assistant at Watford in 2005 with manager Adrian Boothroyd . It was due to the majority at Elland Road wanting Gary McAllister to be named for the hot-seat. It is feared Hockaday may not have enough experience to take on such a role at the former First Division champions, despite a C.V. covering 20 years of playing and 14 years of coaching. Hockaday began his coaching career after Watford allowed him to take charge of their U18 side. He cut his teeth with the youngsters for five years, before moving on to the first team, assisting Watford in securing Premier League promotion in 2005 from the Championship.

"A former TV news reporter is claiming to be psychic after sending text messages to himself to 'prove' he can see into the future. John Thomson, from Bristol, started ‘feeling and seeing’ words and phrases in March last year and because he didn’t think anyone would believe him decided to log them on his phone. The 44-year-old says by having the messages dated on his phone before the events happen, it proves he is psychic. Predicative text: Psychic John Thomson claims he has started 'seeing' major world events before they happen and he has the text messages to prove he knows about them in advance . Foresight: Messages come to John in the form of phrases starting with a different word and then finishing '...comes to you' Messages come to Mr Thomson in the form of phrases starting with a different word and then finishing '...comes for you'. On August 6 this year Mr Thomson sent himself a text after seeing the words ‘Manilla comes for you’ the day before a deadly hurricane struck the Philippines. And in the first week of October Mr Thomson said he saw the words ‘Haemorrage comes to you’ days before a man came to the UK suffering and later dying from Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) which sparked a nationwide health scare. Mr Thomson, who used to work for Scotland's STV, can have up to 20 visions a day. He is now a full-time author and has published a book about his experiences entitled ‘Seer (The Man Who Sees Tomorrow). He said: 'When I first started to see the phrases I was worried what it meant, was it coming for me?

'The visions if you like started to occur in March 2011 that’s when I started to experience seeing things, well probably more like sensing them. 'I used to work as a reporter so having a background in news I wanted to note these experiences down, because I didn’t always have a notebook I decided sending a text to myself was just as good and it meant I had a record of them. 'It was in August last year when I had gone to visit my parents when I first realised what these visions meant. I had a vision of the phrase ‘Manilla is coming for you’ so I sent it to myself in a text.' The next day Mr Thomson  said he was walking past the TV and he saw the news about a hurricane hitting the Far East country leaving many dead. Mr Thomson said: 'The visions seem to be more about global events not just about Britain, I had one saying ‘the witness comes for you’ then the next day it was announced Iran had been launched a military drone called The Shahed - which means ‘Witness’. 'I can have anything from three or five to 20 visions a day and I’m sorry to say that they are not all good, but I feel that whatever happens, be it bad or good, it happens for a reason. 'I have been asked if I got a vision about something bad happening would I try and do anything about it? 'Say I was around when JFK got shot and I had a vision a few days before, the answer is I would have told people, but these experiences are prophetic, you can’t stop them happening.” Mr Thomson admits his seeings will sound mad or even insane to some people but he wants to use his ‘gift’ to help others. Mr Thomson said he had offered the police information about some ongoing investigations and hoped he could help again.","John started 'feeling and seeing' words and phrases in March last year .

"Gary Anderson was spurred on to win his first World Championship title by the memory of his brother and father who died within months of each other. The Flying Scotsman revealed he ignored jibes from those who derided him as he struggled to recapture the form that made him 2011 Premier League champion. Anderson, 44, lost his brother Stuart, who died of a heart attack aged 35 in the autumn of 2011, and his father Gordon the following spring. He admitted that afterwards he could not face throwing arrows and it coincided with a slide down the world rankings. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the moment Anderson was crowned world champion .

But he learned to love the game again and had the last laugh by beating Phil Taylor to lift the Sid Waddell trophy and £250,000 in winnings. ‘It’s hard to concentrate on darts when you have that going on,’ said Anderson. ‘People were saying, “He is finished”, but I couldn’t give two monkeys what they think. There are some horrible people in the world that keep sniping at you — I just got on with it.’ Anderson overcame the greatest player in darts history to win Sunday’s final 7-6.

I played in the pub, where it all started.’ Teetotal Anderson celebrated his famous victory with a coffee and a sleep before returning to his Somerset home with partner Rachel. He was looking forward to seeing nine-month-old son Tai. ‘I’m not going to treat myself with the prize- money,’ he said. ‘I’ll just get the tools out and do a bit of DIY. I know (fellow darts player) James Wade loves working on cars, I like doing jobs around the house to chill out. I was in the building trade for 20 odd years so it is nice to get your hands dirty. I’m a normal person, I’m not a prima donna. I am the same boy that was on the building site, even after this.’ Anderson has overcome his fair share of obstacles, including becoming increasingly short-sighted. The mental arithmetic has also tripped him up on occasion. ‘I am one of the worst counters on a dartboard,’ he said. ‘I made a mistake in the semi-final and had to be corrected.

"Iago Aspas has a better goals-per-minute ratio than Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Neymar this season. The Liverpool forward, on loan at La Liga side Sevilla, has amassed an impressive record of one goal every 71 minutes in all competitions this term. Although notable in itself, the statistic becomes more impressive when compared to the biggest names in world football. Ballon d'Or holder Ronaldo for example, who has scored a goal every 72 minutes, and Messi - one goal every 82. Iago Aspas (third right) celebrates with his team-mates after scoring for Sevilla against Real Madrid this week . Aspas also scored a late winner at the weekend as Sevilla came from behind to beat Espanyol 3-2 . Messi's Barcelona team-mate Neymar, who has impressed with 22 goals already this season, has a goal every 87 minutes. In fact, Aspas' record is the best of every major league in the world. To put the statistic into context, Aspas has only scored 10 goals in his 19 games this season. He hasn't played as many minutes as the likes of Ronaldo and Messi, but has managed to net regularly when he has taken to the pitch. Seven of Aspas' strikes have come in the Copa del Rey - six of them against one club. Sevilla travelled to lowly Sabadell in October, beating them 6-1, and the Liverpool man scored a hat-trick. Neymar has a goalscoring record of one goal every 87 minutes, compared to Aspas' goal every 71 minutes . The Liverpool loanee has also recorded a better ratio than the two best players in world football . In the reverse fixture in December there was another rout, and Aspas again scored a hat-trick in a 5-1 win, taking the aggregate score to 11-2. To give credit to Aspas, he has taken his incredible cup form to La Liga in the last fortnight, scoring in consecutive fixtures against Espanyol and the might of Real Madrid. Whether or not he will be given the chance to impress at Anfield is yet to be seen, but if the 27-year-old can continue his form at Sevilla, Brendan Rodgers will be keeping a close eye on his player.","Iago Aspas has scored a goal every 71 minutes for Sevilla this season .

"Scott Mitchell stayed calm to land his first BDO World Championship crown with a nail-biting 7-6 win over Martin Adams on Sunday night. The 44-year-old had only won two matches on his previous five visits to the Lakeside going into this year’s tournament, but against a three-time champion he kept his cool at the death to win the £100,000 top prize. Mitchell burst into tears before roaring with delight and embracing his family in the crowd. Scott Mitchell holds aloft the trophy after wining the BDO World Championship at the Lakeside Country Club . Mitchell is congratulated by his opponent Martin Adams (right) after a thrilling 7-6 victory . The 44-year-old had trouble containing his emotions after throwing the winning dart . Mitchell broke down in tears before embracing his family in the crowd . Both players had real finishing problems throughout the match, but Adams was the more afflicted and it proved costly. What the contest lacked in quality - and it lacked plenty - it made up for in drama as the match swung one way and then the other. Neither player was able to establish more than a one-set lead, but, after missing a dart for the title when 6-5 and 2-1 in front, Mitchell clinched the deciding set 3-1. Mitchell told the BBC: “This is quite amazing. “Halfway through that I really wished I was watching it, I didn’t really want to be up here. “It’s everything that dreams are made of really, I can’t believe it.” Fifty-eight-year-old Adams got off to a flying start with two 180s in his first three visits to the oche, but the doubles eluded him. He missed eight doubles in the first set as Mitchell took it 3-0. Three time champions Adams makes his entrance ahead of the final showdown . Adams celebrates winning a set but had trouble with his finishing for a second consecutive match . Adams, who was also taken to a deciding set in his semi-final win over Glen Durrant, struggled again with his finishing in the opening leg of the second set, but finally took it against the throw and produced a 123 checkout to go 2-0 up. He started the next leg with five perfect darts, which paved the way for him to level the match to love. The three-time champion moved 2-1 ahead by taking the third set 3-2, but Mitchell hit straight back. Mitchell took the first leg of the fifth set against the throw and then missed four darts at a double to go 2-0 up. The finishing problems were now Mitchell’s as Adams regrouped to establish a 3-2 advantage. Those problems threatened to continue as Mitchell missed two darts at double top to take the sixth set 3-0, but he recovered to win it 3-1 and level the match at 3-3. There were three breaks of throw in the first three legs of the seventh set before Mitchell finally held his throw to make it 4-3. Mitchell missed four darts for a 5-3 lead, leaving Adams instead to level the match at 4-4. The man with 22 years of Lakeside experience moved 2-0 ahead in the next set, but a 94 checkout with a bull finish helped calm Mitchell’s nerves and he duly reeled off the next two legs for a 5-4 lead. Adams made it all square again, finally hitting double 16 at the fifth time of asking. Mitchell watches as Adams stages a late comeback to take the match into a deciding set . Mitchell won the final set 3-1 after finishing with a double top to take the title . After another three straight breaks at the start of the 11th set Mitchell held his throw to move to within one set of the title. Mitchell led 2-1 and had a dart for the title, but missed double 16 and Adams upped his game, taking out 91 to make it 6-6.

Sweeper-keeper Lloris not only bails his backline out with his hands, but he’s also pretty useful with his feet, repeatedly vacating his penalty area to avert danger. He’s arguably the best keepers in the Premier League. Hugo Lloris has developed into one of the best goalkeepers in the Premier League . RIGHT BACK – MATHIEU DEBUCHY . Neither team is blessed with great quality in this area. Kyle Walker has failed to mature into the England regular we thought he would, while Arsenal’s Calum Chambers has not made the impact expected of him at the Emirates this season and has been out of the side during their recent good form. That leaves Debuchy as the default selection, but even then it is a reluctant one given his injury record this season. On his day, however, he is aggressive in both defence and attack and the best north London has to offer. France international Mathieu Debuchy beats Tottenham's Kyle Walker to the right back spot . CENTRE BACKS – JAN VERTONGHEN & LAURENT KOSCIELNY . Spurs’ Vertonghen is the obvious pick to marshal the rearguard. The Belgian is a class act and one of the first names on the team-sheet at White Hart Lane. Federico Fazio has started to impress of late but it is Arsenal’s Koscielny who gets the nod to partner Vertonghen. He is a far safer bet than Per Mertesacker, who has struggled for form this season in the wake of his World Cup triumph with Germany. It's one from each team in the centre of defence as Jan Vertonghen lines up with Laurent Koscielny (right) LEFT BACK – KIERAN GIBBS . There’s not a great deal between Gibbs and Danny Rose. Both are pacey, join the attack at every opportunity and boast great recovery at the other end. But it is Gibbs who gets the nod. Were it not for injuries then he would have established himself as England’s best left back and, given Luke Shaw’s failure to impact at Old Trafford this season, Gibbs, at 25, could make the position his own should he maintain his fitness. Arsenal left back Kieran Gibbs, who struggles with injuries, gets the nod ahead of Danny Rose . RIGHT MIDFIELD – ALEX OXLADE-CHAMBERLAIN . Andros Townsend is still struggling to build on last season’s breakthrough and the jury remains very much out on his credentials as a top Premier League player. But at Arsenal there is no doubting that Oxlade-Chamberlain is the real deal. England were robbed of the daring and direct dribbler at the World Cup and, at his best, he should be a certain starter for both club and country. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain bursts past Stoke midfielder Glenn Whelan in January . CENTRAL MIDFIELD – AARON RAMSEY . There are a host of candidates to fill the central-midfield berth, not least Ryan Mason, who has been outstanding for Spurs this season. Francis Coquelin is beginning to make a similar impact with the Gunners, while Jack Wilshere was proving his critics wrong before injury struck, again. But it is the class and composure of Ramsey which wins him the role in the middle of the park. With just six goals this season he should be offering more in that department, but the Welshman is the heartbeat of the side and one of the best midfielders in the division. Aaron Ramsey wins midfield berth beating competition from the Ryan Mason and Francis Coquelin . ATTACKING MIDFIELD – CHRISTIAN ERIKSEN . Again, we are spoilt for choice in this domain. Santi Cazorla showed his silk during the recent win at Manchester City and is a pleasure to watch at his best. Consistency, though, remains a concern with the Spaniard, as it does with team-mate Mesut Ozil, who, while mesmerising on his day, defines ‘flaky’ in the games in which he goes missing, and that happens far too often. This position, then, belongs to just one man – Christian Eriksen. The Dane has been nothing short of incredible this season and has 11 goals already, proving the match-winner on countless occasions. Christian Eriksen has been in superb form for Spurs this season, netting 11 goals in all competitions . LEFT MIDFIELD – THEO WALCOTT . Nacer Chadli has found his feet this season after a difficult first campaign. Walcott, however, remains the best threat from a wide position on the books at either North London club. Since returning from injury he has proved his worth and his devastating pace – allied to an increasing composure – makes Walcott an invaluable asset. Theo Walcott scored his first Premier League goal since returning from a serious knee injury . SECOND STRIKER – ALEXIS SANCHEZ . You could put the Chilean anywhere across the frontline and he would terrify the opposition. His debut season in the Premier League has been mightily impressive, not least because he marries graft to his craft. His return of 18 goals speaks for itself and Sanchez is looking like the signing of the season. Remind us why Barcelona let him go? Alexis Sanchez has enjoyed a brilliant start life at Arsenal and has scored 18 goals in all competitions . STRIKER – HARRY KANE . The 21-year-old has seen them all off at White Hart Lane and Roberto Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor cannot get close to what Kane offers the team in terms of goals and overall contribution. He has 20 goals this term and is undoubtedly the biggest success story of the season so far. Rivalling him for our No 9 jersey are OIivier Giroud and Danny Welbeck, but a return of eight and seven goals respectively means Kane gets the pick, just as he should do when Roy Hodgson names his next England team. Harry Kane has been a revelation this season, scoring more goals than any other Premier League player .

"Atletico Madrid striker Fernando Torres has suggested Luis Suarez is struggling to score goals for Barcelona because he is not the main man at the club. The Uruguay international persuaded the Catalan giants to part with £70million to secure his services last summer after scoring 31 Premier League goals for Liverpool in 2013-14. But the 28-year-old has failed to replicate his goalscoring exploits for his new club and former Liverpool striker Torres believes it is because he is playing second fiddle to Lionel Messi.

'You have to realise that Luis comes from making 50 goals in a team in which he was the one who made the goals,' Torres told AS. 'At Barca you have to start to subtract that amount because Messi makes 50 a year. That is normal.' Suarez has scored just two La Liga goals this season and five in all competitions but Torres still believes the striker is fundamental to Barcelona. 'He is fundamental. He is a very good player.

"Christian Eriksen and Mesut Ozil will walk out at White Hart Lane for the north London derby between Tottenham and Arsenal on Saturday knowing they can be the catalysts that launch their team to victory. Eriksen has emerged as Tottenham's star man this season alongside Harry Kane. He has hit nine goals in the Premier League so far and played in every domestic match under Mauricio Pochettino. For Ozil, his campaign has been tumultuous. The World Cup winner has been criticised for failing to scale the heights that justify the £42.5million transfer fee paid by Arsene Wenger to Real Madrid in the summer of 2013. VIDEO  Sportsmail's battle of the danger-men: Christian Eriksen vs Mesut Ozil . Christian Eriksen (left) and Mesut Ozil (right) will be expected to lead their teams to north London derby glory . Eriksen (centre) has been in sensational form for Tottenham this season, playing every Premier League game . Midfielder Ozil returned to form against Aston Villa last Sunday and inspired Arsenal to a 5-0 victory . But last Sunday, the German international propelled Arsenal to a 5-0 victory over Aston Villa with one of his finest displays in a red shirt. He provided an outrageous back-heeled flick to assist Oliver Giroud's opener, scored the second and had another ruled out in a relentless display of creative attacking football. Spearheading Arsenal's victory against a Villa team on an alarming slide is one thing, but Ozil was brought in to provide the platform for victories in games like Saturday's against Tottenham. In his eight appearances in the league this season (Ozil missed three months with a knee injury), he has completed 420 passes as well as 22 successful dribbles. In comparison, Eriksen has made 993 passes and 33 dribbles in 23 games in a style under Pochettino that is aligned with Wenger's passing philosophy. Mauricio Pochettino will hope Eriksen continues his impressive form against Arsenal on Saturday . Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger could move five points clear of Tottenham if his team win on Saturday . But the Denmark man clearly poses more of a goalscoring threat than Ozil, with 16 goals in 48 games during his Premier League career, an average of one in three. Ozil, who arrived in north London two days after Eriksen signed for Spurs in 2013, has netted seven times in 34 Arsenal league appearances. Eriksen has also covered 259.7km in the Premier League, the most of any player this season and two kilometers more than second placed Nemanja Matic of Chelsea. He is emblematic of the high-intensity pressing game that Pochettino employs and has swiftly become a figurehead of his new manager's regime. Ozil (centre) in action for Arsenal against Tottenham in the 1-1 draw in September at The Emirates . Eriksen has scored nine times in the league for Tottenham this season and has covered the most ground . Sports analysts, BSports , believe an Arsenal win is the most likely outcome in the north London derby . The 22-year-old is playing his best football yet at White Hart Lane, where as across north London at The Emirates, Arsenal supporters will argue that Ozil's zenith is yet to be seen. They will be the key men in Saturday's encounter as one side will look to deal a major blow to the other's Champions League hopes. In the fearsome atmosphere that is often produced when these two teams collide, both Pochettino and Wenger will hope their creators do not wilt in the heat of the encounter and lead the way in putting the other to the sword.","Christian Eriksen has been instrumental for Tottenham this season .

"After years of torment, the family of the fisherman who claims to have spent 14 months adrift in the Pacific has spoken of their delight at his 'incredible' survival. José Salvador Alvarenga left his parents and daughter in Garita Palmera, El Salvador, years ago to earn a living in Mexico. When he disappeared in 2012, his relatives mourned. Scroll down for video . Fatima, Mr Alvarenga's 14-year-old daughter, who was six when he emigrated to Mexico, says she will give her father a big hug and kiss . 'A mix of sadness and happiness': Jose Ricardo Orellana, Alvarenga's father said he had mixed emotions about his son returning over fears of his well-being . 'Incredible': Proud parents María Julia Alvarenga, 59, and José Ricardo Orellana, 65, are delighted to know their son is alive after months of torment. Here they reveal a family photo of a younger José . The old family home of Jose Salvador Alverenga's family in Garita Palmera, El Salvador, before he headed to Mexico to make a living . Now, in an emotional interview to confirm his identity, his mother has spoken about her trauma for the first time, revealing she prayed for her son every day and saw him alive in her dreams. María Julia Alvarenga, 59, today told El Salvador's El Mundo newspaper: 'I dreamed about him, I saw him alive in my dreams. 'But then he vanished. I kept dreaming like that for several days. 'I feel happy that my son is alive and that soon we'll have him back home. She added: 'We thought that he must be dead. 'I cannot find the words to describe how I feel, as his mother, to know that he has been found.'

She . said she is now excited to meet him once more: 'First thing I'll do is hug him and kiss him.'

He wept on the phone to his brothers and sister in Maryland, parents and daughter in El Salvador . His sun-bleached hair has been trimmed and wounds have been treated as he prepares to be reunited with his family on Friday. Asked what he would say to his family, Alvarenga told Telemundo: 'That I miss them very much and I will be with them soon.' I cannot find the words to describe how I feel, as his mother, to know that he has been found . But he was treated to something of a reunion last night with a phone call to his siblings who live in Maryland. The brothers and sisters gathered to watch footage of Mr Alvarenga arriving in Majuro - and screamed, 'That's him!' Brother-in-law Jorge Bonilla said: 'It's incredible! I'm so happy' Mr .

His father, José Ricardo Orellana, 65, said: 'I feel mixed emotions to see José Salvador like this, a mix of sadness and happiness. 'I had heard that he has gone to sea and was lost at sea, but I always prayed for his well being.' Alvarenga's incredible story is not being doubted by U.S. officials in the Marshall Islands - even as some cast doubt on his claims - and as new details emerged of his life at sea, his account has gained credibility. Now, experts have come out in support of his claims. Jaime Marroquín, the Mexican rescue service official who oversaw the search, told the Guardian a boat and two fisherman were reported missing from Costa Azul on 19 November 2012. It was reported missing by the boat's owner, who Mr Alvarenga mentioned in his statement. Fisherman in Costa Azul also confirmed they knew Mr Alvarenga, saying they knew him as 'La Chancha' - or 'The Pig'. They said he had lived and worked in the area for years. 'It’s a great surprise,' fisherman Belarmino Rodriguez Solis told El Salvador newspaper today. 'Nobody survives more than two or three months in those conditions. 'We even laid flowers in the palm hut where he lived,' Solis added. 'When fishermen leave and do not return we look for them.' Another fisherman, Williams Decuir Uscanga, said: 'We’re surprised, we couldn't believe it, now that we saw him on the news we’re totally sure it is him.'","Mother prayed for her son every night but mourned his passing .

"A row over money owed from full back Stephen Warnock’s move from Aston Villa to Leeds in January 2013 has led to Elland Road refusing to deal with football agents SEM in future. Leeds consultant Graham Bean, effectively in day-to-day control for Italian owner Massimo Cellino, has cut any ties with SEM following incendiary texts sent to him by their managing director Craig Honeyman. One text from Honeyman infuriated Bean, highly respected former FA compliance chief. It read: ‘Pathetic old policeman trying to throw his weight around. It doesn’t work without the uniform old man. I will meet you anywhere any time no problem. Don’t ever try to threaten or intimidate me. I’ve seen your waistline.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch a hilarious chant from a Leeds United fan . Dispute: Leeds are now refusing to work with SEM after a dispute over money in Stephen Warnock's deal . Bean said: ‘Mr Honeyman needs to be a lot more professional in his dealings with clubs. Sending such immature messages is not acceptable in any form of business.’ Honeyman took over as CEO after Jerome Anderson resigned last September. He said: ‘Commission was due on a deal. Leeds didn’t want to pay. Our lawyers dealt with the matter. Payment was received and we all move on.’ Amir Khan has eloquent knowledge of boxing, both amateur and professional, which will ensure he is in high demand as a pundit when he hangs up his gloves. And his passion for the sport while working for BBC on Commonwealth Games boxing contrasts sharply with the tired track and field coverage. Impressive: Amir Khan's work on the BBC's boxing coverage in Glasgow has been insightful . The BBC’s biggest extravagance at the Games has to be the temporary studio they have built on the River Clyde just 300 yards from BBC Scotland’s headquarters with its huge broadcasting capacity. The Beeb felt they needed a backdrop of the ‘Armidillo’ Clyde Auditorium and the Hydro concert hall, but wouldn’t reveal the hefty hire fee for this vanity project which includes nine days of construction and another week spent dismantling it from tomorrow night. One of the Games winners has been sportswear brand Kukri, who have greatly raised their profile by supplying kit for Team England in a value in kind deal. Kukri pleased athletes by involving them in the design, leading to the third colour of maroon along with red and white on the clothing. Hooper’s drug denial . New Zealander Mike Hooper, chief executive of the Commonwealth Games Federation, said yesterday he had run out of superlatives to describe his own event, including the drug-ridden weightlifting competition among the ‘great, brilliant, outstanding wonderful competitions.’ All this hyperbole before announcing Nigerian Chika Amalaha, 16, had failed a second drugs test. She was later stripped of her weightlifting gold medal. How can Hooper — who is stepping down after Glasgow — praise any sport, let alone weightlifting with its serial drug offenders, whose coaches can corrupt a young athlete to such devastating effect? Stepping down: Mike Hooper will quit after the Commonwealth Games and praised weightlifting controversially . England Rugby 2015 have had a team of observers in Glasgow examining what they can learn from the Games, including the transport arrangements. These are sure to be a complex business at the Rugby World Cup as well. The railway station at Cardiff, which hosts eight games, is a concern judging by complaints about the crush and two-hour queues in the rain after the Heineken Cup final. An ER 2015 spokeswoman said: ‘We are developing a detailed transport plan for each game at the Millennium Stadium.’ Mark Palios, former FA chief executive, is in detailed talks to take a controlling interest in struggling League Two Tranmere. Palios made 190 appearances for the club from 1973-80 while also developing his career as a chartered accountant and business turnaround specialist. The deal, which is expected to go through, does depend on terms being agreed over the next week with millionaire owner Peter Johnson, founder of the Park Group, who has been looking for new investors for almost a decade and has written off £5m worth of debt owed to him.

"Tottenham welcome Arsenal to White Hart Lane on Saturday and both teams have already got the competitive juices flowing with derby 'throwbacks' being posted on their youtube accounts. The in-form teams go head-to-head in the north London derby with only two points separating the sides. Sportsmail looks at these 'throwbacks' and discusses some of the best goals. Tottenham . Jermain Defoe v Arsenal (November 2004) - White Hart Lane . The Sunderland striker scored a memorable individual goal when the home side were 3-1 down, as he glided past Cesc Fabregas and Patrick Vieira and curled a shot past the helpless Jens Lehmann and into the to corner. Jermain Defoe (left) had a fine Tottenham career but is now in the north east at Sunderland . Danny Rose v Arsenal (April 2007) - White Hart Lane . The left back had a debut he would never forget after scoring thunderous 30-yard volley. Gunners keeper Manuel Almunia cleared the ball from a corner and Rose hit it first time - giving Almunia or his defence no chance of stopping it. Danny Rose (left) has now established himself as Tottenham's first choice left back this season . Gareth Bale v Arsenal (November 2010) - Emirates Stadium . The Real Madrid star burst through from a devastating counter-attack involving Defoe and Rafael van der Vaart before slotting home past Lukas Fabianski and helping Tottenham fight back from 2-0 down to come away with all three points from the Emirates. Gareth Bale earned his record-breaking move to Real Madrid after being in blistering form for Tottenham . Kyle Walker v Arsenal (October 2011) - White Hart Lane . Walker scored a spectacular winner at White Hart Lane back in 2011, when he picked up a loose ball from Luka Modric's blocked shot and his swerving drive deceiving the helpless Wojciech Szczesny. England international Kyle Walker has since scored a number of long range efforts for Tottenham . Arsenal . Thierry Henry v Tottenham (November 2002) - Highbury . The Arsenal legend scored arguably the greatest ever goal in the north London derby when he picked the ball up in his own half, beat three Spurs defenders and slotted the ball into the bottom corner to give the home side the lead. Thierry Henry (centre) scored arguably the most memorable goal of the north London derby . Theo Walcott v Tottenham (November 2012) - Emirates Stadium . Arsenal fought from 2-0 down to beat Spurs 5-2 and winger Theo Walcott sealed the victory after controlling an Alex Song through ball and slotting home past the helpless Hugo Lloris. Theo Walcott's (right) return from injury is a welcome boost and he scored against Aston Villa on Sunday . Tomas Rosicky v Tottenham (March 2014) - White Hart Lane . The Czech midfielder scored the only goal in a tense affair but it was one he is unlikely to ever forget, after arrowing a shot from the corner of the box into the top corner, following a swift counter attack. Tomas Rosicky scored one of his best goals for Arsenal in the same fixture last season at White Hart Lane . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain v Tottenham (September 2014) The England international scored a late equaliser at the Emirates Stadium to hand Arsenal a deserved draw. The winger smashed home from close range after the ball fell to him from a goalmouth scramble.

"Kim Bo-kyung says he is looking forward to working with Wigan Athletic manager Malky Mackay again after the South Korea winger signed for the Championship club until the end of the season. Kim worked with Mackay at Cardiff City before the manager was sacked by  Malaysian owner Vincent Tan in December 2013 amid a storm of racist, sexist, anti-semitic and homophobic text messages in which he was implicated. The Football Association are still investigating the messages retrieved when files were seized from Iain Moody, Cardiff’s former sporting director, who resigned from his position at Crystal Palace when Sportsmail revealed the scandal in April 2014. Kim Bo-kyung says he is looking forward to working with Wigan manager Malky Mackay again . Among them were the use of the term ‘chinkys’ — in direct reference to the arrival of Kim — and a joke about Koreans eating dogs. The situation got worse when Wigan chairman Dave Whelan spoke about ‘chingalings’ as he defended his decision to appoint Mackay back in November. But Kim expressed his delight at being reunited with Mackay following his medical at the DW Stadium. The 25-year-old said: 'I am very happy to be joining up with the gaffer again. 'I really enjoyed working with him in the past and he helped me so much in my career. He gave me the chance to fulfil my dream of playing in England and I am now looking forward so much to working with him again. 'Since becoming a free agent, we had various offers but when the chance came to be with the gaffer again at Wigan, this really was the only place I wanted to come. 'The other players have all made me welcome already. The atmosphere in the dressing room seems very good, there is a nice feeling with all the lads and we now have to keep working hard to pick up as many points as we can and start climbing the league table.' Wigan manager Mackay has signed South Korea winger Kim as a free agent . Kim worked with Mackay at the South Wales club before the manager was sacked by owner Vincent Tan . Mackay came in for heavy criticism last year when the League Managers’ Association issued a statement describing the text messages as ‘friendly banter’, but the 42-year-old Scot later issued a full and unreserved apology. It was reported last week that he is likely to be cleared by the FA, who are believed to have a policy of not being able to act on communications sent privately between two individuals. Wigan, deep in the Championship’s relegation zone, sold Ben Watson, Shaun Maloney, Adam Forshaw and Callum McManaman during the January transfer window, which closed on Monday night. Mackay signed Leon Clarke on loan from Wolves and Sheyi Ojo on loan from Liverpool, and also snapped up the Cameroon defender Gaeten Bong on a short-term deal. His latest signing, Kim, scored his first top-flight goal in a 2-2 draw with Manchester United in November 2013, but has appeared just twice in the Championship this season and had his contract cancelled by mutual consent on January 24. The 25-year-old has won 30 caps for his country and was handed the No 7 shirt following the retirement of South Korea legend Park Ji-sung, but missed out on a place in the squad for the recent Asia Cup, in which they lost a thrilling final 2-1 to Australia in Sydney.","Kim Bo-kyung has joined Wigan Athletic until the end of the season .

"Joseph Chernach stands on the sideline during a high school football game in Crystal Falls, Michigan. He later committed suicide at the age of 25 after suffering from early dementia, his family claims . The mother of a 25-year-old man who hanged himself is suing Pop Warner football, claiming his suicide was the result of dementia and deep despair caused by brain injuries suffered while playing youth football. Joseph Chernach committed suicide in his mother's shed in Hixton, Wisconsin, in 2012, after brain injuries began to impair him in his sophomore year at college, it is claimed. The lawsuit filed in federal court in Madison, Wisconsin, says he suffered from a degenerative brain disease called dementia pugilistica, also known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE, and that he also had post-concussion syndrome. It alleges he got them from playing in a Pop Warner league from 1997-2000, beginning when he was 11. Pop Warner Little Scholars, named after legendary coach Glenn Scobey 'Pop' Warner, is a non-profit organisation that facilitates youth football programmes for children aged between five and 16. The wrongful death lawsuit by Debra Pyka seeks at least $5 million from Langhorne, Pennsylvania-based Pop Warner Little Scholars, the Pop Warner Foundation and their insurance company. It says Pop Warner never warned Chernach, other children or parents about the risks of playing tackle football and alleges Pop Warner Football is an 'ultrahazardous activity' that's intrinsically dangerous to children. It stated: 'Pop Warner - by engaging in the business of sponsoring, organizing and promoting tackle football for children - engaged in conduct that was outrageous, malicious, intentional and was done with the intentional disregard of Joseph Chernach's rights as well as all other children who played Pop Warner football, not just in the State of Wisconsin but everywhere in the United States.' A Pop Warner spokesman did not immediately return a call seeking comment Thursday night. According to the lawsuit, Chernach got good grades in his freshman year at Central Michigan University. But it alleges the cumulative effects of CTE and post-concussion syndrome began to impair him in his sophomore year. 'From that point on his behavior became increasingly bizarre,' the complaint says. 'From that point on his mood became progressively depressed and ultimately paranoid, distrusting his closes friends and family. ... Joseph Chernach's suicide was the ""natural and probable consequence"" of the brain damage he suffered playing football.' In an interview, his mother said her son eventually stopped going to class. She said: 'The depression got worse as time went on. The last year was awful. He was in his room a lot. He lived back and forth with his brother and some of his friends. 'He would come to my house. He just could not stay in any place at once. He tried to hold down a job but it was difficult for him. He would sleep all day and then be up at night.' His family didn't learn of his brain damage until they received the autopsy results. The family's lawyer, Gordon Johnson, of Sheboygan, Wisconsin, said it showed that Chernach was halfway toward the worst form of dementia seen in older football players. 'There really is only one thing that could cause CTE in a young person as this and that is repetitive head trauma,' he said. 'The only repetitive head trauma Joseph Chernach had was from playing football.' The attorney acknowledged that Chernach also played high school football, but said he was most vulnerable playing youth football. Mr Johnson said it was the first of what may be many cases against Pop Warner for exposing children to the kinds of risks that even the NFL is concerned about for its players. He said they think there have been hundreds of other suicides in which autopsies, had they been done, would have pointed the finger at youth football. 'I think that somebody should be held accountable for Joseph's death,' Mrs Pyka said. 'I want to see tackle football stop for these young kids... They should not be banging their brains together.'","Joseph Chernach committed suicide in 2012 suffering from early dementia .

"Football is (almost) back. And here, Sportsmail's RIATH AL-SAMARAI gives you the lowdown on the new season of the Championship. Best bit of business . Udinese’s Matej Vydra, 22, has returned on loan to Watford, where he scored 24 goals in his first season in English football, winning the 2012-13 Championship Player of the Year. He was rarely used during his loan at West Brom but insisted he didn’t want a return to the second tier. If he can get over the disappointment, he might be the signing of the summer. Back again: Matej Vydra could turn out to be a fine signing for Watford, returning for his second spell at the club . Already under pressure . Leeds boss Dave Hockaday. The club’s owner, Massimo Cellino, is about as unconventional as you get and this appointment was straight out of left field. Hockaday has only previously managed Forest Green Rovers, a tenure that hardly sparkled. His reward is a club with a great history and an owner known as the ‘mangiallenatori — manager eater — because he has worked his way through 37 in 22 years in football. Manager on the rise . Eddie Howe. Split across two spells at Bournemouth, the 36-year-old has led the club from 23rd in the fourth tier to the Championship. Loves passing football and Brendan Rodgers said: ‘It is coaches like Eddie Howe who will take the game forward in this country.’ Pressure: Dave Hockaday knows he must impress Massimo Cellino straight away at Leeds United to survive . Players to watch . Mats Daehli (Cardiff): Turned down Man United to join Cardiff and has looked superb. He’s a technically gifted midfielder. Will Hughes (Derby): Only just turned 19 and a fine midfielder who already plays for England’s Under-21 side. Jordan Rhodes (Blackburn): A prolific striker. With the most recent first, his goal tallies for the past five seasons are: 25, 28, 36, 16, 19. Star talent: Will Hughes will look to kick on with Derby County again this season . Likely strugglers . Blackpool – Lucky to stay up last season and new manager Jose Riga arrived to find he had only six professionals to work with. Millwall – Finished 19th last season and added little quality over the summer. Birmingham – Survived on a dramatic end to last season and Lee Clark has instigated a mass rebuild of his squad. Protests: Things are already bad off the field for Blackpool, let alone on it . Contenders . Cardiff — Kept most of their squad and made strong signings in Adam LeFondre, Kagisho Dikgacoi and Javi Guerra. Fulham — Felix Magath has had an extremely busy summer in the market, signing nine players. Derby — Looking to make up for missing promotion last season. New boy George Thorne has suffered a bad knee injury. The big spenders . Fulham have signed nine players and spent an astonishing £11million for 27-year-old Ross McCormack from Leeds. It’s the biggest fee paid by a club in the Championship. Hefty fee: Ross McCormack will hope to live up to his £11m price tag for Fulham this season .","Fulham and Cardiff could be the main contenders .

"When Barcelona went to Doha this week to meet and greet their current shirt sponsor Qatar Airways it was significant that they chose Neymar to represent them. With his 23rd birthday falling on Thursday and already having clocked up more air miles than any of his team-mates since the summer, the Brazilian would have benefitted from the rest more than any other player in the dressing room, but needs must – Neymar is the face of the future for Barca and when the club meets its biggest and most important sponsor, he has to be there. Qatar Airways are due to end their sponsorship of the club in 2016. If a new deal is to be agreed it will need to be finalised before the end of this year. With Neymar and Gerard Pique turning up in Doha on Wednesday there was talk that the sponsor was considering doubling its existing offer of €30million (£22.4million) a year to €60m (£44.8m) a year. Neymar was chosen to go to Doha this week to represent Barcelona and meet their sponsors Qatar Airways . Neymar, since his move from Santos in June 2013, has begun to cement himself as the face of Barcelona . Dressed in a fetching Hawaiian shirt, Neymar recently fronted a Qatar Airways television advert . Barca are currently debating the possibilities of continuing with Qatar. That debate would be cut short if a firm offer of €60m (£44.8m) is indeed made. The answer would be yes. With the European Commission more determined than ever to cut off all perceived sources of state aid to the big clubs in Spain, private money is more important than ever and Barca need the Qatar cash. Qatar also need the association with the club and with the freshest face in football in Neymar, whose kudos has rocketed in the last eight months with his heroic attempt to drag a poor Brazil side to World Cup glory and his 22 goals for Barca this season. As well as being crucial to the club’s new shirt sponsorship deal, Neymar will be integral to Barcelona’s battle with Nike to improve the €40m (£29.9m) a season offer currently in play. Barca want closer to the £75m that Adidas will pay Manchester United every year from next season. They believe having one of the American sport’s brand’s top clients in Neymar should entitle them to that. Neymar (left) and Gerard Pique represented Barcelona in Doha to launch a marketing campaign this week . It seems Neymar (right) is taking the mantle from Lionel Messi, who has so often been the front of campaigns . Barcelona are also in negotiations with two broadcasters for the rights to show their games next season. The pressure from the Spanish government to force Madrid and Barca by law to negotiate with the other 18 clubs and share the income has completely stalled and the Catalan club are trying to improve on their current €140m (£105.5m) a season deal. Again Neymar’s part in promoting whichever company wins the rights, will be of vital importance. Back at training on Thursday, the day of his birthday, he was congratulated by his team-mates and there were messages from all over the world including from the last magical Brazilian to light up the Camp Nou, Ronaldinho, and from Pele who had predicted so many ‘new Peles’ that he was always going to get one right in the end and seems to have done so with Neymar. Barca need Neymar to work for them as much off the pitch as on it to justify the outlay of what now looks like more than €90m (£67.2m) for the player they bought from Santos in a convoluted deal that involved 11 different contracts to both the club and the player’s parents' company N&N - a piece of cutting-edge financial engineering which they were proud of at the time but that has landed them in court with the Spanish tax man wanting a greater share of the pot. A recent Beats advert features Neymar in the dressing room - he is a hot property in the marketing world . There does not seem to be any friction between Neymar and Messi as the baton is passed between them . The good news for the club is that the player is a natural at fulfilling his commercial responsibilities – handling the spotlight as well as David Beckham did at Madrid. One of the arguments Barcelona used to convince Neymar to sign for them and not go to Madrid, who made a late push, was that he would have less pressure in Catalonia playing alongside Lionel Messi and a host of Spain internationals who had won the World Cup. But now that the focus starts to shift gently from Messi to the Brazilian superstar four years his junior, there are no signs that he cannot handle it. There are also no signs of conflict with Messi, something that Johan Cruyff predicted when the Brazilian first arrived. ‘You can’t have two captains on the same boat’ was his famous doomsday prediction, but from the moment Neymar gave his first press conference and declared that he wanted to learn from Messi who he repeatedly called ‘the best in the world’ things have gone smoothly. Neither does the Argentine mind that some of the marketing burden, that he has always hated, is now shared. If both skippers are trying to sail in the same direction it seems there is not a problem and both Neymar and Messi are doing their bit to make sure Barcelona stay financially ahead of their big European rivals. Aged 27 Messi remains the image of the club that has won the European Cup more than any side this century. But at 23 Neymar is the face of the future.","Neymar went to Doha this week to meet and greet sponsors Qatar Airways .

"Brendan Rodgers has the opportunity to mark his 100th Premier League game as Liverpool manager by consigning local rivals Everton to defeat in the Merseyside derby on Saturday. Out of Liverpool's seven managers in the Premier League era, the Northern Irishman has a win percentage of 53.54%, second only to Rafael Benitez who marginally edges him with 55.26%. And despite his tenure at Liverpool being a trophyless one so far, Rodgers can reflect on the milestone with pride at the improvement the club have made under his stewardship. Brendan Rodgers takes charge of his 100th game as Liverpool manager when they play Everton on Saturday . Rodgers' win percentage of 53.54% is second only to Rafael Benitez (right) who won 55.26% . Gerard Houllier won 50% of his Liverpool games, the third most successful manage in the Premier League era . He almost led Liverpool to their first Premier League title last season as his side won an incredible 11 games straight and finished second. Benitez is Liverpool's most successful manager, winning 126 out of the 228 matches he oversaw as Liverpool boss. Gerard Houllier, Benitez's predecessor, won exactly 50% of his games while Roy Evans, Liverpool manager from 1994-1998, is fourth as he was successful in 47.28% of his games. Kenny Dalglish, the man Rodgers replaced as Liverpool boss, won 42.86% of his games. Graeme Souness, who was a team-mate of Dalglish's as a Liverpool player, won 41.18% when he was manager from 1991-1994.

"Police chiefs have handed Leeds United more than £1.2 million after the High Court ruled that the Championship football club had been overcharged for policing at home games, a judge has heard. But Leeds' bosses claim that they are still owed more than £800,000, Sir David Eady was told. The figures emerged on Friday after the judge examined the latest stage of the dispute between West Yorkshire Police and Leeds. Overharged: West Yorkshire Police have been ordered to pay Leeds £1.2m . Two years ago Eady ruled that the force overcharged for 'special police services' over three seasons between 2009 and 2012, following a High Court hearing. West Yorkshire Police and Leeds are now arguing over how exactly much should be repaid. The judge on Friday revealed detail of developments in the case in a written analysis following a further High Court hearing in London in June. 'In July 2012, I ruled that Leeds United Football Club had been charged for special police services over the three preceding football seasons, in respect of home matches, on a basis that was in part unlawful,' Eady said. 'It thus became necessary to find a methodology by which to calculate the appropriate rebate. It did not prove possible for the parties to agree a formula. Each ... proposed a distinct methodology.' Dispute: Leeds United and West Yorkshire Police have been in court over fees for services . The judge said one area of dispute related to how special police service charges should be made for the 2012-13 seasons and 2013-14 seasons. 'West Yorkshire Police has paid Leeds United Football Club £1,238,816.61 which is said to represent the total loss including interest,' he added. 'Leeds United Football Club, on the other hand, seeks a further £844,016.36 plus interest (to include claims in respect of 2012-13 and 2013-14).' The judge said the force had 'repaid the rebate it thought due' and 'claims now that no more is owed'. Eady said a 'particular problem' related to the policing of areas of land near the entrance to Elland Road - where a statue of former Leeds captain Billy Bremner was sited. Boost: Leeds ownere Massimo Cellino (centre) knows the club are under financial difficulty . The judge said that, because of crowd movement, there was no 'definitive method' of identifying how many officers were needed in each area. He said the only practical solution was to attribute a 'fair and reasonable proportion' to each area. He said Leeds wanted a 'detailed breakdown' of how many officers were deployed on each match day and at 'what rate of remuneration'. But he said that would go beyond what was reasonable and impose unnecessary burdens upon police bosses. The original litigation had centred on the policing of land near the ground not owned, leased or controlled by Leeds. Eady had ruled that the services rendered fell within the normal police duty to keep the peace.","Championship club in dispute with West Yorkshire Police .

"Dele Alli's life is about to change following an eye-catching £5million move to Tottenham Hotspur on transfer deadline day but for the moment the 18-year-old wonderkid is not being treated any differently by his team-mates at MK Dons. His return to the League One club's training ground after putting pen to paper at Spurs was greeted with good-humoured shouts of 'Can I be your water-boy?' by the other players. While a reminder has been pinned on the team noticeboard that he still owes a £10 fine for letting his mobile phone go off on the team coach heading to Crewe last weekend. Tottenham signed 18-year-old Dele Alli on transfer deadline day before loaning him back to MK Dons . Alli has impressed for MK Dons this season and attracted interest from a number of top clubs . The MK Dons youngster has scored 12 goals in 32 appearances for the League One side so far this season . Second-place MK won that game 5-0 and face leaders Bristol City on Saturday afternoon in Alli's first appearance since making this week's headlines. Spurs have allowed him to play for his hometown club on loan for the rest of the season. 'The lads have had a little wind-up but he's a kid everyone likes and we just want the best for him,' says MK goalkeeper David Martin, who went through something similar when he joined Liverpool as a teenager. 'He's been laughing and joking in training and wanting to score goals. We'll know on Saturday if this week has effected him but I am really confident it won't. He lobbed me in training on Thursday, top corner, and walked away smiling. So it's the same old Dele.' Alli has done more than anyone in MK Dons' brief history to help present them as something more than a franchise club stolen from Wimbledon. He is a local boy from Milton Keynes who grew up near the current ground and has been with The Dons since he was 11-years-old. It remains a huge part of his life; he lives with the parents of MK team-mate and best pal Harry Hickford – Harry's dad even accompanied Alli for the medical at Spurs - and one of the reasons he chose to sign for Tottenham rather than Newcastle United or Aston Villa was because he knew their Head of Recruitment, Paul Mitchell, from when he worked in a similar capacity at MK. Alli was recently named League One player of the month while Karl Robinson won manager of the month . Alli has been compared to Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard since making a name for himself at MK Dons . Comparisons have been made between 6ft 2in Alli, who has scored 12 goals from midfield this season, and Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard. Martin, son of former West Ham and England legend Alvin, is in a unique position to judge having spent four years at Liverpool training alongside Gerrard and behind Alli for the last couple of seasons in League One, including a famous 4-0 Capital One Cup victory against Manchester United in August. 'Del has probably got everything you need; height, strength, power and a football brain,' said Martin. 'I've seen him head a corner away from our 18-yard box and finish up in the opposition penalty area scoring a goal, at 18 he's already become one of our main men in the team, and we all know it. 'I remember his first game at 16, he bopped one in the top corner and I wondered if it was a fluke. But the way he's been this season, controlling games and controlling other midfield players who might be in their thirties, has been amazing. 'He just doesn't show any fear. You can't say at this stage he will do everything Stevie has achieved but I will be surprised if he doesn't play for England. And he has a similar personality to Stevie, besides the football. 'Del is quiet in the dressing-room but if the banter is flying about, he can cut you with a quick one-liner. He has something about him. Calm, cocky and cool!' A different comparison can be made with Wayne Rooney, who burst onto the scene shortly before his 17th birthday but was regarded as a man-child because of his physical strength and mentality at a young age. Karl Robinson will be hoping Alli can help MK Dons seal promotion to the Championship . Alli, the Sky Bet League One Player of the Month for January, has already played 76 first-team games despite not turning 19 until April. He happily plays cards with the older players on away trips and isn't shy on controlling the music on the dressing-room iPod. R&B artist Chris Brown is a personal favourite. It's his performances in the big games that mark him out as something potentially special. 'In our home game against Swindon, we were losing 1-0 until Del whipped in an equaliser and we ended up winning. He has dug us out so many times, I've seen a lot of young players hit the ground running and then hit a brick wall. But Del is happy to take responsibility,' said Martin. 'I think we all look around before kick off, see Del in the middle and think we'll be alright. Even against Manchester United, he looked so comfortable in that company. And doing a pre-season with Spurs will make him even better with better players around him. It wouldn't surprise me if he is in their team this time next year.' MK Dons goalkeeper David Martin, pictured with chairman Pete Winkleman, has heaped praise on Alli . Martin's own career at Liverpool didn't take off as he'd hoped. With Pepe Reina so consistent as No 1, he went on loan to several clubs including Leicester City and Derby County before rejoining MK Dons. The goalkeeper wishes he'd have had some of Alli's remarkable inner confidence for such a young player. 'I had butterflies driving up the M6 to sign for Liverpool. When I first saw Steven Gerard in front of me, it took my breathe away, I was in awe. Del would have respected him but on the pitch he wouldn't have thought twice about nutmetting him. He has an ego, he wants to be the best and if an opponent needs sorting out on the pitch, he'll do it.' In the meantime, the youngster has to cough up his tenner. Even Premier League players have to turn off their mobiles on the MK Dons team coach.","Dele Alli sealed a £5m switch to Tottenham on transfer deadline day .

"Jailed: Student Xuanyu Zhong, 25, drugged and sexually assaulted his female victim after becoming obsessed with date rape pornography . A university student obsessed with date rape pornography turned his fantasy into reality by drugging and sexually assaulting a woman. Xuanyu Zhong, the son of a Chinese government official, committed the crime after watching hours of sick rape videos on the internet. The Northumbria University student researched date-rape drugs, bought some online and carried out a sex attack on a woman who accepted a drink from him. Zhong, 25, denied sexual assault but was found guilty and jailed for six years at Newcastle Crown Court. He had intended to copy the videos by raping his drugged victim but changed his mind at the last minute and sexually assaulted her instead, the court heard. The student was eventually caught when his victim remembered parts of the assault ordeal and reported it to the police. But that was only the start of the woman’s nightmare. She was subjected to a campaign of threatening texts and phone calls after Zhong’s father – who is based in China – and friends tracked her down and tried to put pressure on her not to give evidence. However, she stood firm and Zhong was forced to stand trial. It was only at a later sentencing hearing that the pervert admitted what he had done in a letter to  the judge. Judge Paul Sloan, QC, said the Chinese police had been informed about the actions of Zhong’s associates. Convicted: Zhong denied the charges but was found guilty of sexual assault by a jury at Newcastle Crown Court, pictured. He eventually confessed to the crime in a letter to the judge ahead of being jailed for six years . The judge told Zhong: ‘This was a . premeditated offence. You offered to get your victim a drink and, when . she accepted, you laced that drink with the drugs you obtained. Her recollection of events thereafter is very limited.’ The incident took place in December . 2011. The judge added: ‘I’m satisfied that for some time prior to these . offences, you had fantasised about drugging a female and then sexually . assaulting your victim by having intercourse with her while she was . incapacitated.’ Detectives examined the student’s . computer and discovered months earlier he had viewed web pages detailing . the effects of different date-rape drugs. A month before the attack, he viewed eight pornographic videos showing women being drugged and raped while incapacitated. 'For some time prior to these offences, you had fantasised about drugging a female and then sexually assaulting your victim by having intercourse with her while she was incapacitated' Judge Paul Sloan, QC . ‘You accepted when pressed during the course of your evidence that you were sexually excited by such videos,’ said the judge. The student formulated a plan, bought the drugs and put it into action. He laced his victim’s drink and later . forced himself upon her while she lay helpless. Commenting on the . defendant’s letter to the judge, Paul Cross, defending, said: ‘His . letter isn’t a complete acceptance but it is a substantial acceptance. ‘It expresses remorse and explains the factors which made it difficult for him to put in a guilty plea at an earlier stage.’ It is not known which date-rape drug Zhong used, but before buying it, he tested two others that didn’t work.","Xuanyu Zhong, 25, was obsessed with brutal date rape pornography .

Manchester City will finish five points behind Chelsea in the table, according to the predictions . Arsenal will continue their climb up the table to claim third place behind Chelsea and Manchester City . The predicted top eight in the Premier League by BSports and their chances of finishing in the top four . The top eight in the Premier League as it stands ahead of the weekend's fixtures . Arsenal will continue their recent upturn in form and surge up the table to finish third, some nine points behind City but two ahead of United. Louis van Gaal's team will fulfil the manager's objective of returning to Europe's foremost competition and in some comfort, finishing five points ahead of Spurs. But, according to the BSports projection, Spurs will again have to settle for the Europa League and Liverpool will also miss out on the top four. They also predict that Southampton's European challenge will fade away and they will drop to a final position of seventh, just one place but quite a few points ahead of the season's other surprise package West Ham. BSports have also calculated each side's chances of finishing in those all important top four places. Chelsea have a 100 per cent chance of making it, while City are 99.8 per cent certain. Arsenal are given an 83.2 per cent of finishing in the Champions League spots, while United are rated at having a 73.9 per cent chance. Manchester United will make their return to Champions League football by finishing fourth in the table . Tottenham will just miss out on the top four and will have to settle for the Europa League once again . Liverpool will finish down in sixth according to the BSport projection, missing out on the Champions League . Southampton will slip down the table from their current position of fourth to finish in seventh . West Ham's chances of breaking into the top four have faded . Analysing the title run-in, the relative strengths of the squads and the current five-point margin, they say Chelsea have a 77.7 per cent probability of winning the title. The exciting title race continues this weekend with Chelsea travelling to goal-shy Aston Villa and Man City at home to Hull City. Man United head to West Ham on Sunday afternoon while there are two local derbies - in north London between Tottenham and Arsenal, and Merseyside between Everton and Liverpool. BSports take into account all kinds of different factors when working out their predictions from form and league record to squad strength and upcoming fixtures. Each fixture is run through their systems 100,000 times, a sample size large enough to eliminate most ambiguities. It now remains to be seen whether the Premier League top-four race turns out as predicted here.","BSports have predicted every remaining fixture in Premier League season .

"Babies can be exposed to high levels of chemical emission from mattresses as they sleep, a new study has found. Researchers tested the the foam padding in crib mattresses, and found they release significant amounts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), potentially harmful chemicals also found in household items such as cleaners and scented sprays. Today they warned parents to air mattresses properly to minimise the risk. The researchers say that mattresses release potentially harmful chemicals when a baby's body heat warms them. Findings suggest reuse of an older crib or an extended airing-out period may help reduce infant VOC exposures. However, the team say reuse of crib mattress must be considered carefully because older mattresses might contain toxic substances, such as flame retardants, that have been banned. The researchers studied samples of polyurethane foam and polyester foam padding from 20 new and old crib mattresses for the study in the February issue of Environmental Science & Technology. The 20 mattress samples are from 10 manufacturers. The researchers chose not to disclose the names of the manufacturers studied so that their results could draw general attention to the product segment without focusing on specific brands. Boor decided to conduct the study after finding out that infants spend 50 to 60 percent of their day sleeping. Infants are considered highly susceptible to the adverse health effects of exposure to indoor air pollutants. 'I wanted to know more about the chemicals they may inhale as they sleep during their early stages of development,' said, who led the study. 'This research also helps to raise awareness about the various chemicals that may be found in crib mattresses, which are not typically listed by manufacturers.' New crib mattresses release about four times as many VOCs as old crib mattresses, the team found, and body heat increases emissions. Chemical emissions are strongest in the sleeping infant’s immediate breathing zone, they said. The researchers identified more than 30 VOCs in the mattresses, including phenol, neodecanoic acid and linalool. At present, not much is known about the health effects that occur from the levels of VOCs found in homes, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Among the many chemicals considered VOCs are formaldehyde, benzene, toluene, perchlorethylene and acetone. The crib mattresses analyzed in this study did not contain those organic compounds. The researchers concluded that, on average, mattresses emitted VOCs at a rate of 87.1 micrograms per square meter per hour, while older mattresses emitted VOCs at a rate of 22.1 micrograms per square meter per hour. Overall, Boor said crib mattresses release VOCs at rates comparable to other consumer products and indoor materials, including laminate flooring (20 to 35 micrograms per square meter per hour) and wall covering (51 micrograms per square meter per hour). The researchers identified more than 30 VOCs in the mattresses, including phenol, neodecanoic acid and linalool. The most abundant chemicals identified in the crib mattress foam, such as limonene (a chemical that gives products a lemon scent), are routinely found in many cleaning and consumer products. Chemist and indoor air quality expert Charles J. Weschler, adjunct professor in environmental and occupational medicine at Rutgers University, said he does not think the levels of chemical concentration found in the mattresses are alarming, but he considers the research valuable. 'It’s good to be alerted to the fact that crib mattresses are a significant source of chemicals in an infant’s environment,' said Weschler, who noted crib mattresses might one day be analyzed for noxious chemicals as a result of such research. The researchers found that VOC levels were significantly higher in a sleeping infant’s breathing zone when compared with bulk room air, exposing infants to about twice the VOC levels as people standing in the same room. Additionally, because infants inhale significantly higher air volume per body weight than adults and sleep a longer time, they experience about 10 times as much inhalation exposure as adults when exposed to the same level of VOCs, the researchers said. 'Our findings suggest the reuse of an older crib or an extended airing-out period may help reduce infant VOC exposures,' said assistant professor Ying Xu.Although used mattresses may appear to be a good alternative, the researchers noted that older mattresses might contain other harmful chemicals such as flame retardants now banned in mattress foams. Graduate student Brandon Boor, in the Cockrell School’s Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering, conducted the study under the supervision of assistant professor Ying Xu and associate professor Atila Novoselac. Boor also worked with senior researcher Helena Järnström from the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. The 20 mattress samples are from 10 manufacturers.

The crib mattresses analyzed in this study did not contain those organic compounds.Understanding the sleeping environment is important to the health of infants and adults, added Richard Corsi, chair of the Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering.“We need to better understand the complex sleep microenvironment to improve it and reduce the harmful effects of related pollutants on infants,” Corsi said.The National Science Foundation and the Nordic Research Opportunity program funded the project. Boor conducted the research in Finland, where he currently lives.The University of Texas at Austin is committed to transparency and disclosure of all potential conflicts of interest. All UT investigators involved with this research have filed their required financial disclosure forms with the university. None of the researchers have reported receiving any research funding that would create a conflict of interest or the appearance of such a conflict.Notes for ParentsFindings suggest reuse of an older crib or an extended airing-out period may help reduce infant VOC exposures.Reuse of crib mattress must be considered carefully because older mattresses might contain toxic substances, such as flame retardants, that have been banned.","Team found that the mattresses release significant amounts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)

"Research suggests that balling up the right hand and squeezing it tightly makes it easier to memorise lists . Clenching your fist could be enough to help you get a grip on your memory. Research suggests that balling up the right hand and squeezing it tightly actually makes it easier to memorise lists. Later, when it is time to retrieve the information, it is the left hand that should be clenched. It is thought the movements activate brain regions key to the storing and recall of memories. The American researchers suggest those who are short of  a pen and paper should try the trick when attempting to commit a shopping list or phone number to memory. In the study, volunteers  were given a rubber ball and asked to squeeze it as hard as possible before trying to memorise a list of 72 words. They squeezed the ball again a  couple of minutes later, ahead of recollecting as many of the words as possible. One group used their right hand on both occasions, another their left. A third group clenched their right fist ahead of memorising and their left ahead of recall and a fourth did the reverse. A fifth group held the ball but did not squeeze it. Those who squeezed with their right hand, followed by their left, remembered the most words. The next best were the volunteers who made a fist with their right hand both times, while those who didn’t squeeze at all did better than those who led with their left. It is thought that the movement of clenching the right fist activates a brain region that is involved in storing memories, while squeezing the left hand triggers an area that is key to retrieving information. Lead researcher Dr Ruth Propper said: ‘The findings suggest that simple body movements – by temporarily changing the  way the brain functions – can improve memory.’ More research is needed to see if other types of memory can be boosted – and if left-handers also benefit from the trick.

"Lyon coach Hubert Fournier has criticized the behavior of Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, saying he has a nasty habit of insulting referees in English or Italian. French league leader Lyon hosts second-place PSG on Sunday, and the French champions will climb into first if they win. The well-traveled Ibrahimovic, who has played in Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, and his native Sweden, is returning to form after recovering from a nagging heel injury. Zlatan Ibrahimovic in action against Lille in the French League Cup on Tuesday night . Fournier thinks referee Clement Turpin should brace himself for a difficult time dealing with the notoriously fiery Ibrahimovic, who has won league titles with Juventus, Barcelona, Inter Milan, AC Milan, Ajax, and two-time defending champion PSG. 'The person who is going to be most provoked is rather Mr Turpin, like all the referees in this league who get insulted by this person,' Fournier said on Friday at a pre-match news conference. 'Apparently, the referees are not bilingual or trilingual, so they don't understand. In a way, it's better to speak Italian or English to insult referees.' The PSG striker stretches his leg as he tries to pull the ball out of the air . The game could be a turning point in the season, and opposes Lyon's tight unit of largely homegrown players with the expensive signings of a PSG side sometimes found wanting for team spirit. Fournier has warned his players to keep their composure - and to stay respectful. 'I don't want (our team) to provoke, I don't want us to insult the officials,' he said. 'I hope we remember not to fall for Zlatan's provocations.' Ibrahimovic has suffered an injury hit season but is now getting back to his best . PSG's confidence is high following six straight wins, while Lyon has been dealt a double blow by the injury-enforced absences of 21-goal league top-scorer Alexandre Lacazette and key center half Milan Bisevac both out injured. Lacazette won't be sidelined for long by a hamstring injury, but Bisevac is out for the rest of the season with a knee injury, meaning Lyon have to try and contain Ibrahimovic with a makeshift center-half pairing.","PSG take on Lyon in a top of the table clash in Ligue Un on Sunday .

"The Equatorial Guinea football federation has been fined £65,573 and ordered to pay for the treatment of Ghana supporters who were injured by flying missiles during Thursday's African Nations Cup semi-final at the Estadio de Malabo. The Confederation of African Football (CAF) imposed the punishment on Friday, and announced a one-match suspended ground closure on Equatorial Guinea, the tournament hosts who lost the semi-final 3-0. The ground closure will only be enforced should there be further trouble during Saturday's third-place play-off match between Equatorial Guinea and DR Congo, which also takes place at the Malabo stadium.

"Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard is not expecting Everton fans to change their tune when he runs out at Goodison Park for his final Premier League Merseyside derby. Only Ian Rush has scored more goals against the Toffees than the 34-year-old, but, with his time in English football coming to end, the last few months of the season are being seen as a chance to celebrate his career and contribution to his boyhood club. It is not a sentiment entertained across Stanley Park, where Gerrard has been the target for abuse from almost the moment he made his debut in 1999. Steven Gerrard has revealed he is looking forward to his last derby match as an Everton player . Liverpool captain Gerrard is expected to face arch rivals Everton on Saturday afternoon . Liverpool's Scouse captain accepts his summer departure to the Los Angeles Galaxy does not mean Toffees fans will change their stance. 'I doubt it very much,' he said. 'We'll have to wait and see on that one. 'I had some stick from an Everton fan yesterday but it is part of my life living in this city. 'I love the banter with Everton fans. It's what it's all about. It's about rivalries and big games of football. 'I'm up for all that. I don't mind it at all. Bring it on, as far as I'm concerned. 'It will be my last derby and it will be someone else's turn to be in the spotlight. 'It becomes Jordan Henderson's problem (as he is likely to succeed Gerrard as captain) and Jon Flanagan's problem (as a local lad) because the Everton fans will soon turn on them.' Gerrard has a habit of getting under Everton's skin, whether it is on the pitch - where he has scored 10 goals in 32 appearances, including the first Anfield hat-trick in 77 years in 2012 - or off it. Gerrard believes Jordan Henderson and Jon Flanagan will be the target of  'banter' at Goodison Park . Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho has been in fine form during the last few weeks . After the 2-2 draw at Goodison in October 2012, Gerrard was forced to backtrack on comments likening their near neighbours to Stoke in being a long-ball team. He admitted his frustration got the better of him and he went 'too far'. 'I've got respect for all the Everton players and the Everton fans,' Gerrard, who picked that hat-trick and the FA Cup semi-final win at Wembley in 2012 as his derby highlights, told LFC TV. 'I think they're a terrific football club but, once that whistle goes, I want to beat them. That's a good problem for me. 'It's the fixture that I look for at the beginning of the season. 'I love playing against Everton. I've got friends and family members who are big Blues and it's all about the bragging rights in the city. Brendan Rodgers believes his side are 'operating at a really good level' ahead of the Merseyside derby . 'I'll focus on (Saturday's game) exactly how I have done in the previous derbies I've played in. 'It's a bit different from a normal league game, but I'm looking forward to that one and hopefully I can add to my good derby record.' Liverpool's key players in their recent resurgence have been the likes of Raheem Sterling, Philippe Coutinho, Lazar Markovic, Emre Can, Jordan Henderson and Mamadou Sakho and all are aged 24 or under. But despite their relative youth - Sterling, Can and Markovic are all just 20 - manager Brendan Rodgers is confident they will cope with the atmosphere of an away derby against more experienced opponents. 'They understand the nature of playing for the club and the nature of derby games,' the Northern Irishman said. 'A lot of these young players have been involved in derby games (elsewhere) but this will be a new experience.' Liverpool are unbeaten in their last seven league matches, having won the last three, while Everton recorded their first win in seven league matches at Crystal Palace last weekend. But if the Reds have any psychological advantage, Rodgers is not playing it up. 'At this moment in time we as a team are operating at a really good level,' he said. 'We should have won the game earlier in the season, that is the reality, but we are hoping going to Goodison we can put in a performance.

"Morocco have been banned from the next two African Nations Cups and fined £656,000 for pulling out of hosting this year's competition, the Confederation of African Football has announced. CAF also ordered the Moroccan Football Federation to pay compensation of eight million euros (£5.9m) for losses sustained by CAF, its stakeholders and partners as a result of its decision not to host the tournament.

Manchester City's Wilfried Bony and Yaya Toure (right) have reached the 2015 AFCON final with Ivory Coast . Ghana players celebrate after also reaching the final following victory over stand-in hosts Equatorial Guinea . Morocco in October requested to postpone the tournament by a year before failing to respond to a CAF deadline in November to confirm whether they would go ahead with hosting. After a meeting of the CAF executive committee in Malabo on Friday, the federation said in a statement: 'Morocco had based its request to postpone the tournament by a year on 10 October 2014, on allegations 'of the highest health risk'. Morocco cited the outbreak of the Ebola virus as a case of force majeure in justifying its request for postponement, citing in particular the risk of contamination of its population because of anticipated fans' flows. 'CAF raised objections and inadmissibility of Morocco's request who were obliged to state their position of withdrawal from the organisation of the 2015 Orange Africa Cup of Nations by 11 November 2014. Morocco reached the final of the 2004 tournament before losing to Tunisia . A helicopter disperses crowds after crowd trouble marred the host's semi-final with Ghana . 'The executive committee considered that, contrary to what the Royal Moroccan Football Federation cited, force majeure cannot be accepted for the benefit of the federation.' CAF also confirmed the punishments, which see Morocco banned from the 2017 and 2019 editions of the African Nations Cup. They won the competition in 1976 and were beaten finalists in 2004, but have since failed to progress beyond the first round.","Morocco pulled out of hosting AFCON 2015 over the Ebola epidemic .

"Arsenal forward Theo Walcott is relishing the chance to play against north London rivals Tottenham on Saturday. The 25-year-old enjoys the fierce competition between the two clubs and famously reminded Spurs fans of the 2-0 scoreline with a cheeky hand gesture during Arsenal's FA Cup victory last season. But Walcott insists his antics were all in good fun and to be expected during such a hugely significant game.

Arsenal players train at the club's Coley base ahead of the crucial derby showdown with Tottenham . Attacking midfielder Santi Carzola dribbles the ball away from team-mate Theo Walcott in training on Friday . 'Me and the Tottenham fans have a good relationship in terms of the banter side of things', he told the Evening Standard. 'That's what comes with football. This is a massive game and it is all about the bragging rights. 'Things like that have happened in the past and it won't be forgotten about, I'm sure, but it is one thing I've moved on from. Every player will get stick I am sure but it is about just trying to go out there and perform. 'Any criticism won't affect me at all. It is enjoyable — it's a bit different and it is always a great atmosphere at White Hart Lane. It is probably the fixture I always look forward to playing in the most, to be fair. It is one of the biggest games for both sets of fans and this year it is going to be tight.' Walcott takes on defender Jores Okore in Arsenal's last Premier League game, a 5-0 win over Aston Villa . Arsenal are currently fifth in the Premier League table with 42 points and have not lost since New Year's Day . Walcott heads into Saturday's derby having scored in Arsenal's last two games against Brighton and Aston Villa. The Gunners not have lost since their New Year's Day defeat to Southampton and last month's 2-0 win over the champions Manchester City has proven to be the catalyst for a superb upturn in form that shows no signs of dipping. But Spurs are on a similarly good run themselves and have lost just one of their last nine league games, a shock 2-1 result to Alan Pardew's Crystal Palace. With arguably five teams vying for third and fourth place in the Premier League this year, Saturday's derby has seen its stakes undoubtedly raised. Tottenham are also on a fine run of form and have lost just once in their last nine Premier League games . Just five points separate third placed Manchester United and seventh placed Liverpool, with Southampton, Arsenal and Spurs occupying the places in between. With all of these teams targeting qualification for next season's Champions League, the north London derby is perhaps as important as it has ever been. 'I think it is an even bigger game this year than ever,' said Walcott. 'Tottenham are doing very well, getting those last-minute goals which shows a knack of getting important three points. It will be two very strong teams that are very high on confidence so for the neutral it will be a very interesting game.'","Theo Walcott can't wait for Arsenal to take on north London rivals Tottenham .

"A big weekend of derbies in the Premier League sees Arsenal travel to Tottenham and Liverpool face Everton. At Goodison Park, Liverpool will look to continue their impressive run of form, while the race for fourth hots up at White Hart Lane. To celebrate, Sportsmail's experts cast their minds back to decide the best derby matches they've ever seen... MARTIN KEOWN . Tottenham 0-5 Arsenal, December 1978 . As a fan I loved watching Arsenal beat Spurs 5-0 in 1978, with Liam Brady scoring that fabulous goal. He bent it in the corner and as a young kid that was a classic game. In terms of playing, the most memorable derby I played in was the FA Cup semi-final at Old Trafford in 2001. It was Sol Campbell’s last game for Tottenham before he moved to Arsenal and it was great to beat our old rivals. Arsenal's Alan Sunderland celebrates with his team-mates in the Gunners' 5-0 drubbing of Tottenham in 1978 . MATT LAWTON . Manchester United 4-3 Manchester City, September 2009 . To borrow a line from my intro that night, until this remarkable game reached its extraordinary climax, a conversation between Michael Owen and Sir Alex Ferguson about derby winners would have been limited to events on Epsom Downs. Owen’s winner, scored in the sixth minute of second-half stoppage time after City had equalised three times, crowned what Sir Alex Ferguson considered the greatest Manchester derby in history. Michael Owen (right) breaks past Shaun Wright-Phillips to score the winner against Manchester City in 2009 . DOMINIC KING . Everton 2-3 Liverpool, April 2001 . Last season’s 3-3 draw at Goodison Park was possibly the best football match these two sides have produced in the last 20 years but it has to play second fiddle to the meeting in April 2001. Five goals, dreadful refereeing decisions for both sides, a missed penalty (Robbie Fowler), a scored penalty (David Unsworth), a red card (Igor Biscan) and settled in injury time - 3-2 in Liverpool’s favour - by Gary McAllister’s 40-yard free-kick. Astonishing. Everton goalkeeper Paul Gerrard holds his head in his hands after Gary McAllister's 40-yard free-kick . ROB DRAPER . Boca Juniors 0-3 River Plate, March 2002 . An extraordinarily visceral derby, with Boca’s ground, the Bombonera, shaking as the teams came out. A 21-year-old Esteban Cambiasso opened the scoring for River with Eduardo Goudet and Ricardo Rojas securing the win. What was remarkable was that the entire stadium of Boca fans all sang continuously at deafening pitch for the final ten minutes of the game, expressing their undying love for the club despite the humiliation. Even Rojas’s 88th-minute goal had no impact on them. A young Esteban Cambiasso celebrates after scoring for River Plate against Boca Juniors in 2002 . JOE BERNSTEIN . Everton 3-3 Liverpool, November 2013 . Last season’s Merseyside derby at Goodison matched any classic from yesteryear. Everton and Liverpool were in the top five, bang in form, and reckless in their attacking ambition. The big names delivered - Luis Suarez, Romelu Lukaku (2), Daniel Sturridge, Kevin Mirallas and Philippe Coutinho all scored - and 3-3 was fair because nobody deserved to lose. Daniel Sturridge (right) celebrates with Steven Gerrard after scoring in the Merseyside derby . MATT BARLOW . Sheffield Wednesday 2-1 Sheffield Utd, April 1993 . Brilliant free-kick by Waddle in the opening minutes sparked a memorable match, a United fight back inspired by beardy warhorse and hero Alan Cork in extra time. It was also a fabulous spectacle created by fans from a city where football means so much but where glory days are few. With so much at stake the atmosphere was electric and it wasn’t even in Sheffield. Mark Bright wheels away in celebration after scoring Sheffield Wednesday's winner in extra time at Wembley . IAN LADYMAN . Manchester United 4-3 Manchester City, September 2009 . Old Trafford, and the noisy neighbours were just beginning to annoy the residents of Stretford. This was a day that City would really test United’s mettle, refusing to lie down as, inspired by the remarkable Craig Bellamy, Mark Hughes’ team held his old club at 3-3 deep into added time. United, though, really knew how to win back then and, with seconds remaining, Ryan Giggs played in Michael Owen at the Stretford End. In a flash, a remarkable game was won. JAMIE REDKNAPP . Everton 4-4 Liverpool, February 1991 . I was at that FA Cup replay and it was the best live game I’ve ever watched. The atmosphere was unbelievable and it was a game that had everything – great drama and lots of goals including that incredible strike from John Barnes. From my playing days, it was Liverpool beating Everton 3-2 when Robbie Fowler sniffed the ground after scoring. You always remember the games you win.

"Convicted: PR man Richard Hillgrove has been given a suspended sentence for tax evasion . A controversial PR adviser who failed to pay a £100,000 tax bill and spent the money on school fees, luxury holidays and parties has avoided jail. Richard Hillgrove, who has worked for figures such as Charles Saatchi and Sting, siphoned off VAT, income tax and National Insurance and took the money for himself. However, he walked free from court today after being given a suspended sentence and told to pay just £5,000 towards the costs of his prosecution. Hillgrove, 42, a New Zealander who lives in Somerset, is the owner of Hillgrove Public Relations Limited and calls himself 'the UK's leading crisis communications and corporate reputation management expert'. In 2011 and 2012, he failed to pay HM Revenue and Customs £52,268 of VAT charged to customers of his company, Bristol Crown Crown Court heard. He also deducted £44,846 in taxes from the wages of his employees during the same period but failed to pay it to HMRC. At the same time, he spent thousands of pounds on 'extravagant' purchases such as expensive restaurant meals and the fees at leading public school Millfield. Hillgrove ignored repeated warnings from his accountants - brought in to help repay debts from a previous business - and told them to 'hold fire' on sending tax returns. The jury was told that he 'failed to grasp' his company's 'cash flow issues' and continued to withdraw too much money. Recorder Robert Linford today sentenced him to 15 months imprisonment, suspended for two years, and ordered him to pay £5,000 towards prosecution costs and complete 200 hours of unpaid work. Family: Hillgrove's wife Lois, left, collapsed after the judge pronounced sentence on her husband . 'It is quite clear from the perusal of your bank accounts you were servicing a lifestyle that you simply couldn't afford,' the judge said. 'You told the jury that in the public relations world there's an expectation that public relations consultants take their clients out and spend money on them to keep them as customers. 'I have no doubt at all that the desire to keep customers sweet explains some of the extravagant spending. It does not explain the trip to Madeira or the expensive 30th birthday party for your wife.' The judge said Hillgrove's defence during his trial had been 'unpleasant' at times, adding: 'This was not a conspiracy against you. To suggest that it was is ludicrous. 'You need to rebuild your life and pay the Government what you owe them.' Mr Linford also warned Hillgrove that he would be under added scrutiny from HMRC in the future, and would face dire consequences if he ever 'fouled up' again. Clients: Hillgrove has apparently worked for both Charles Saatchi, left, and his former employees Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo, right . Fees: The PR guru spent part of his ill-gotten funds on the fees at Millfield School in Somerset, pictured . Hillgrove's wife Lois, who supported her husband from the public gallery, collapsed and had to be helped from the courtroom as the judge pronounced the sentence. Hillgrove had denied two charges of cheating the public revenue, but he was convicted by a jury in March. During the trial, prosecutor Joss Ticehurst said Hillgrove should have 'trimmed down' his spending to pay the taxman but failed to do so - as he never intended to hand over the money owed. 'This was a deliberate act on the part of Mr Hillgrove to not pay his taxes,' Mr Ticehurst said today. 'It wasn't simply a one-off, this was for the period of a year. For the period of a year at the start of a new company, and on the back of a history of poor payment of taxes.' Hillgrove told the judge he was working in London five days a week to pay his overheads of £18,000 per month. 'I have always done ringing the newspapers and getting people who want to be on television and get their stories across,' he told the judge. 'I can't do that if the sentence is custodial.' Speaking after the verdict, he refused to confirm whether or not Mr Saatchi is currently a client of his, describing the mogul as 'a friend of a friend'. He added that he planned to appeal against his sentence. Hillgrove PR, founded by the Stetson-wearing New Zealander Richard Hillgrove, claims to represent dozens of well-known companies and individuals. Among the list of current and former clients on the firm's website are Sting, Little Chef, KPMG, Yo! Sushi, Aldi, and Dragon's Den stars James Caan and Duncan Bannatyne. He calls himself 'the UK's leading crisis communications and corporate reputation management expert and the doyen of both personal and business branding', and many of those who have worked with him have given rave reviews. Stars: Rock star Sting, left, and TV entrepreneur James Caan, right, have been represented by Hillgrove . For example, John Bird, founder of the Big Issue, called Hillgrove 'the kind of promoter I could have done with for the last 20 years'. However, last year Hillgrove found himself on the receiving end of media attention when it emerged that he was advising both Charles Saatchi and the Grillo sisters, who had been fired as personal assistants to Saatchi and Nigella Lawson. He described himself as a 'behind-the-scenes svengali' for the billionaire art collector as he was accused of spreading rumours about Saatchi's ex-wife Nigella Lawson taking drugs.","Richard Hillgrove, founder of Hillgrove PR, siphoned off funds from VAT and National Insurance payments .

A study in April found that the top trending word of the year, so far, . is emoji – the small digital images used to express an idea or emotion . in electronic communication - which are continuing to spread like . wildfire online.

'Fortunately there are more than 250,000 possible two-emoji combos, so most are still available!' The site was set up by Londoners Matt Gray and Tom Scott, who say they were inspired by Yo, which allows users to simply send the word Yo. 'The two of us had the idea at about the same time — we weren’t sold on it until we realized that usernames should be emoji too,' Gray told Forbes. 'At that point, we burst out laughing and realized we had to build it.' However, the pair have so far refused to say exactly how the app will work.

Following complaints that the current character set was not diverse enough, the firm said it was working with the standards body that controls them. Because Emoji have to be displayed on different devices, they are tightly controlled by the Unicode Consortium. At present the list of characters contains dozens of faces of people that appear to be white. However, only two of the symbols seem to be Asian and none are black.

"'Disgrace': Aaron Kiely, who appeared to oppose the extradition of Abu Hamza, has been criticised for his lack of attendance at Thurrock Council meetings . A Labour councillor who opposed the extradition of hate cleric Abu Hamza has been branded 'disgraceful' after it emerged he pocketed nearly £7,000 of taxpayers' money despite only attending one half hour council meeting this year. Aaron Kiely, 20, has so far earned £6,667 this year from Thurrock Council, but has only made the one appearance at the mayor-making ceremony in May. And fellow councillors were left . fuming when he publicly threw his support behind the bid to halt the . extradition of hate cleric Abu Hamza to the United States. Current rules mean Mr Kiely must only attend one other full council meeting between now and next May to avoid triggering an automatic by-election. Frustrated fellow councillor Lynn Carr slammed Mr Kiely, claiming he has not been representing the people of his ward in South Ockendon, Essex. She accused him of neglecting the concerns of residents in favour of his £20,000 role as black students officer at the National Union of Students. She raged: 'Cllr Kiely’s attendance record is a disgrace and shows utter contempt for the people of Ockendon who elected him to be their voice in the council chamber. 'Cllr Kiely isn’t trusted to be on any committees this year after he missed half his meetings last year. 'He only has to turn up to one meeting per month, but so far he’s missed all but one of them this year. This month, he was at a student union committee meeting instead. Defeat: Egyptian-born Abu Hamza was extradited to the U.S last week and has appeared in court already . 'Ockendon residents elected him hoping he would bring youthful energy and enthusiasm to the role - instead, he’s missing in action.' To cover the costs of fulfilling their public duties, all 49 Thurrock councillors are paid a basic attendance allowance each year, of £8,000.83. Frustration came to a head this week when Mr Kiely appeared to criticise the deportation of hate cleric Abu Hamza by tweeting: 'British government deporting British citizens to the bastion of human rights that is the USA #shame' It is not the first time he has caused controversy through his official Twitter account @aaron-kiely. In August last year 2011 he was forced to release a grovelling apology after comments he made defending London rioters and describing the Metropolitan Police 'institutionally racist'. Support: Mr Kiely appeared to oppose the extradition of hate cleric Hamza when he posted this tweet . Mrs Carr continued: 'He manages to find time to condemn the decision to deport Abu Hamza and accuse the police of ""brutal tactics"", but not stand up for the people of Ockendon - he’s an utter disgrace. 'When Cllr Kiely was elected he promised that he would be there for local people, but this promise has been cynically broken. 'This makes me angry; when you make someone a promise, it should be kept.' Mr Kiely was voted in as one of three councillors for the South Ockendon ward in May last year 2011. Since the beginning of this year 2012 he has failed to attend meetings in January, February, March, June, July and September. Bried encounter: Mr Kiely has only attended one meeting this year as councillor for South Ockendon at Thurrock Council . Meetings in April were suspended due to the local elections while there was not a full council meeting in August due to the summer break. He has earned almost £3,000 since he last turned up at full council in May. Embarrassingly, if Mr Kiely had been on Thurrock council’s youth cabinet - whose members are unpaid - he would have already been given the boot as members are not allowed to miss more than three consecutive meetings without good reason. The Labour leader of the Thurrock Council, John Kent, has now launched an investigation, warning that the young representative faces suspension. Last night he said: 'We have been supportive of Aaron, but he has fallen short of the standards that we believe should be met. 'Consequently the Labour group now has no option but to take appropriate action against Cllr Kiely and will be investigating issues, including some of the views that he has chosen to put in the public domain. 'We will look at the appropriateness of those comments and of his contribution to the Labour group, his ward residents and the council. 'It is likely that we will seek his suspension from the Labour group while that investigation is undertaken by the appropriate people. What the outcome will be beyond that would be unfair to speculate on at this time.' Despite repeated attempts to contact him for a response, Mr Kiely was unavailable for comment today.","Aaron Kiely, 20, has earned £6,667 so far this year but has only attended one Thurrock Council meeting .

"Stunning pictures from the top of the world show a unique view of lightning storms as they rain down on Earth. The stellar images take storm chasing to new heights, having been snapped from a space station 400 miles above the Earth. One of the most the impressive images shows the early morning Californian skies above Los Angeles and San Diego aglow with powerful flashes of lighting. As the UK endured summer thunderstorms, here's how lightening looks from space. The images, taken by NASA, demonstrate the power of nature seen as flashes of white over the Earth's surface . The white bursts can clearly be seen forming abstract patterns above the orange lights of the cities below. The photographs were taken from the International Space Station (ISS) orbiting the planet by NASA astronaut Karen L. Nyberg. The storms erupted earlier this week, providing a spectacular light show for the astronaut. NASA astronaut Karen L. Nyberg captured the stunning images. They reveal storms above West Africa and Asia, with this one of capturing an elusive red sprite. Sprites are shards of light caused by large-scale electrical discharges that take place high above thunderstorm clouds . Strom clouds, trails of meteor showers and the Sun rising on the horizon can also been seen in Nyberg's breath-taking photographs . She also photographed storms above West Africa and Asia, with one of her images capturing an elusive red sprite. The phenomenon occurs when instead of shooting down towards the ground, lightning explodes in the clouds 50 miles up and fire the red tendrils even higher. The massive explosion happened above Malaysia and the red sprite seen in this rare picture is six miles wide.

Karen Nyberg, 43, who took the photos, was the 50th woman in space and is on board the International Space Station as a flight engineer . Her images follow that of an amateur astronomer, released yesterday, who has become the first person to capture a massive lightning strike 'into space' above the British Isles. The atmospheric phenomena, known as sprites, had never been recorded in the UK before an amateur astronomer in East Yorkshire managed to take the photographic first. Richard Kacerek, 33, spotted the sprite - caused by an upward lightning discharge five miles east of Hull.","Astronaut Karen Nyberg has captured the images from the International Space Station earlier this week .

"Tens of thousands of Muslims took to the streets in Pakistan in anger at the Prophet Mohammed cartoons published by French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. The largest rally was held in Karachi, where 25,000 people shouted slogans including 'death to France', 'death to the blasphemers' and '(We are) ready to sacrifice life for Prophet Mohammed'. Anger remains potent over the repeated depiction of the Muslim prophet in the satirical magazine, whose Paris offices were attacked on January 7 by Islamist gunmen, killing 12 people. 'Death to the blasphemers': Supporters of Jamaat-e-Islami chant slogans during a rally to condemn the French magazine Charlie Hebdo for publication of caricatures of Prophet Muhammad .

'We are ready to sacrifice life for Prophet Mohammed': The largest rally was held in Karachi, where 25,000 people turned up to chant slogans, wave flags and listen to speakers condemning Charlie Hebdo . 'For love of the prophet': Siraj-ul-Haq, chief of Jamaat-e-Islami, Pakistan's main Islamic Party, said the thousands who protested in Paris after the Charlie Hebdo shootings were supporting 'Satan's agents' Charlie Hebdo this month published a 'survivors' issue with an image of the Prophet Mohammed weeping on the cover, triggering a wave of angry condemnation and protest in Muslim-majority countries across the world. Speaking at the Karachi protest, the chief of Jamaat-e-Islami, Pakistan's main Islamic Party, demanded Pakistan call a meeting of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, a group of Muslim countries. He urged the United Nations 'to curb the menace of blasphemy' through changes to international law. 'In Paris hundreds of thousands of people came onto the streets to support Satan's agents and in response to that hundreds and thousands of people have come out here on the streets for love of the prophet,' Siraj-ul-Haq said. Another sizeable demonstration was held Sunday by Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), the charitable arm of the Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group which India accuses of the 2008 attacks on Mumbai that claimed 166 lives. Police estimated that at least 12,000 people attended the JuD rally against Charlie Hebdo in Karachi. JuD Chief Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, who is considered an abettor of Al-Qaeda by the UN, asked protesters not only to boycott French products but to refuse to buy all European imports in protest against the magazine. JI also held an anti-Charlie Hebdo rally in front of the provincial legislature in Lahore - capital of Pakistan's politically influential and most populous province, Punjab - attended by some 5,000 people. A few hundred also turned out for a street protest in the southwestern city of Quetta.

Members of other faiths have also criticised Charlie Hebdo, with the head of Russia's Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, saying today the cartoons Mohammad were 'childish' compared to offences the magazine had dished out to Christians. His pronouncement came after Pope Francis likened mockery of religion to insulting someone's mother - and suggested that in both cases the mocker should expect a response. Under Pakistan's strict blasphemy laws insulting the prophet can carry the death penalty, and the country's prime minister and parliament have strongly condemned the publication of the cartoons. At least three people were injured on January 16 when protesters and police clashed at an anti-Charlie Hebdo demonstration outside the French consulate in Karachi. They included AFP photographer Asif Hassan, who was shot in the back and is now recovering at home after being discharged from hospital.","Large rallies held by Islamist political groups in Karachi, Lahore and Quetta .

"Employees at the Ohio prison where convicted school shooter T.J. Lane staged a jail break on Thursday said that the day before they had segregated an inmate and warned officials about an escape plot. Christopher Mabe, the president of the Ohio Civil Service Employees Association, told CNN that staff filed documentation on Wednesday about the escape plan, there was no 'follow up from prison officials'. He said the inmate who had been segregated was not Lane but didn't know if it was one of the two others who hopped a fence to escape from the Allen Oakwood Correctional Institution in Lima, Ohio. Scroll down for video . Caught: T.J. Lane smirks as he listens to the judge during his sentencing in Chardon, Ohio. Lane and two others escaped from the prison where he was being held, and all were recaptured a day later . Clifford E. Opperud, 45, who was serving a sentence for aggravated robbery, burglary, and kidnapping, escaped with Lane . The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction said it is looking into the report. Lane, the 19-year-old who killed three students at a high school cafeteria east of Cleveland in February 2012, and the other escapees are now all back in custody. Lane was found outside a church 100 yards from the prison shortly after 1am on Friday. All three escapees are now back in custody. Lane was captured outside a church 100 yards away from the prison shortly after 1 a.m. Friday with the help of police aircraft hiding out near a farm building in the area. Now that the manhunt for the prisoners is over officials and others are asking how they managed to escape. In particular, some wonder why Lane wasn't held in the maximum-security part of the prison. He was serving consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole for the shooting at Chardon High School, and has never shown the slightest remorse. 'That is something we have to sit down and take a look at,' Warden Kevin Jones said, according to CNN. Lane pleaded guilty last year to the shooting, and said he didn't know why did it. Before his case went to adult court in 2012, a juvenile judge ruled that Lane was mentally competent to stand trial despite evidence he suffers from hallucinations, psychosis and fantasies. At his sentencing, Lane was defiant, smiling and smirking throughout, including while four relatives of the victims spoke. Escaped: TJ Lane was serving his life sentence here at the Allen County Correctional Institution mixed security prison in Lima, Ohio. Details on how he and his fellow inmates escaped Thursday were not immediately available . In addition to at least three other offenses for which Lane has been punished in recent months, the cold-blooded teen killer has been found guilty of the following disorderliness: . August 2014: Lane was cited for urinating on an Allen Correctional Institution prison wall . October 2013: Lane disobeyed a prison work order and lost 10 days recreation time . August 2013: Lane refused to follow through with a work assignment and was verbally reprimanded . July 2013: Lane was separated from the general population for 10 days as punishment for giving himself a tattoo . Daniel Parmertor and Demetrius Hewlin, both 16, and Russell King Jr, 17, who were killed in the rampage. Three others were injured. Prison officials said they still didn't know how the men escaped. A recent state report on the prison revealed that it's over capacity and has recently suffered from increased violence. An April visit from a state committee found that the 20-year-old facility housed 1,635 prisoners, 217, or 15 per cent, above its capacity, according to the Plains Dealer. The report all addressed problems in the maximum security areas of the prison and noted that the number of inmate assaults on staff jumped 60 per cent in 2013 compared with the previous year. . 'Security management remains a concern, both in terms of how the higher security inmates are handled, as well as discipline for misconduct,' the report states. The frightening words of TJ Lane's attorney: Ian Friedman tweeted his take on his old client's escape on Thursday night, and it left many with a sense of unease . Ohio public safety and correction officials said they led an 'extensive search' for the escaped inmates and had help from local authorities and the Ohio State Highway Patrol. . Reached on Thursday at her home in Chardon, Dina Parmertor, mother of Daniel Parmertor, said of Lane's escape: 'I'm disgusted that it happened. I'm extremely scared and panic stricken. I can't believe it.' Proud murderer: T.J. Lane unbuttons his shirt during sentencing to reveal the word 'killer' emblazoned on his inside shirt . Chardon Police told CNN they offered to provide extra patrols to the families of Lane's victims and to people in the area who asked for it. Attorney Ian Friedman, who defended Lane in the Chardon High case expressed shock when the Cleveland Plain Dealer informed him of his former client's escape. 'It's wild,' Friedman said. 'I'm sure there will be a lot of questions asked about how the correctional facility could allow this to happen.' Friedman also warned that while dangerous in many ways, Lane also wields the weapon of intellect. 'I can't speak to what his mindset is,' Friedman said. 'But I don't think anyone would dispute the fact that he's a very smart young man.' Lane fired 10 shots at students in a cafeteria at Chardon High School, east of Cleveland. He was there waiting for a bus to another school. Prosecutors say Lane took a .22-caliber pistol and a knife to the school and fired 10 shots at a group of students in the cafeteria. Daniel Parmertor and Demetrius Hewlin, both 16, and Russell King Jr., 17, were killed. Lane, who was 17 at the time of the shooting, was prosecuted as an adult. Minutes before his guilty plea, the judge accepted a report finding Lane mentally competent to stand trial. Investigators say he admitted shooting at students but said he didn't know why he did it. Prosecutors say Lane took a .22-caliber pistol and a knife to the school on Feb. 27, 2012, and fired 10 shots at a group of students in the cafeteria. Lane attended an alternative school for students who haven't done well in traditional schools. He was at Chardon waiting for a bus.

Wearing a T-shirt with 'killer' scrawled across it, a teenager cursed and gestured obscenely as he was given three life sentences Tuesday for shooting to death three students in an Ohio high school cafeteria. T.J. Lane, 18, had pleaded guilty  to shooting at students in February 2012 at Chardon High School, east of Cleveland. Investigators have said he admitted to the shooting but said he didn't know why he did it. Before the case went to adult court, a juvenile court judge ruled that Lane was mentally competent to stand trial despite evidence he suffers from hallucinations, psychosis and fantasies. Lane was defiant during the sentencing, smiling and smirking throughout, including while four relatives of victims spoke. After he came in, he calmly unbuttoned his blue dress shirt to reveal the T-shirt reading 'killer,' which the prosecutor noted was similar to one he wore during the shooting. At one point, he swiveled around in his chair toward the gallery where his own family members and those of the slain teenagers were sitting and spoke suddenly, surprising even his lawyer. 'The hand that pulls the trigger that killed your sons now masturbates to the memory,' he said, then cursed at and raised his middle finger toward the victims' relatives. A student who was wounded in the rampage dismissed the outburst. 'He said it like a scared little boy and couldn't talk slow enough that anyone could understand him,' said Nate Mueller, who was nicked in the ear in the shooting. The forgotten school shooting: An Ohio State highway patrol helicopter prepares to leave the grounds of Chardon High School in February 2012 after Lane opened fire with a handgun in the cafeteria of an Ohio high school east of Cleveland on Monday, fatally wounding three students . Dina Parmertor, mother of victim Daniel, called Lane 'a pathetic excuse for a human being' and wished upon him 'an extremely, slow torturous death.' She said she has nightmares and her family has been physically sick over the crimes. 'From now on, he will only be a killer,' she said, as Lane's smile widened. 'I want him to feel my anger toward him.' Prosecutors say Lane took a .22-caliber pistol and a knife to the school and fired 10 shots at a group of students in the cafeteria. Daniel Parmertor and Demetrius Hewlin, both 16, and Russell King Jr., 17, were killed. Lane was at Chardon waiting for a bus to the alternative school he attended, for students who haven't done well in traditional settings. Lane had pleaded guilty last month to three counts of aggravated murder, two counts of attempted aggravated murder and one count of felonious assault. Life imprisonment without parole was the maximum sentence Lane faced. He wasn't eligible for the death penalty because he was 17 at the time of the shootings. Relatives of the slain students indicated earlier they wanted Lane to get the maximum sentence.

"A fraudster who used a Muslim veil to conceal her face on the way to and from court has had her identity revealed by the police. Shaheda Lorgat, 49, stole £21,000 from a college where she worked. Although she revealed her face in court, she kept it hidden from Press photographers under a niqab. But after she was jailed for 12 months, Lancashire Police released Lorgat’s mugshot, with her  features clearly visible. Unmasked: Shaheda Lorgat (left), 49, arrived for hearings (right) at Preston Crown Court in Lancashire wearing a niqab after being charged with stealing the money from a college where she worked as a purchasing officer . Police sources last night revealed a rising trend among Muslim women for wearing the full veil outside court to escape scrutiny. Neighbours of Lorgat said she rarely wore a niqab in public and pictures on her Facebook page show her without a veil. The case comes at a time of increased public debate over Muslim . head-dress, following the  decision by a college in Birmingham to scrap a . ban on veils amid protests from students. Theft: Lorgat (pictured), of Blackburn, Lancashire, had stolen thousands of pounds of money earmarked for college equipment at Blackburn College over an almost-four year period to fund a 'lavish lifestyle' Sentencing: After she was jailed for a year at Preston Crown Court (file picture), police issued her mugshot without her face covering - and insisted that frauds like the crimes she committed would 'not be tolerated' Only this week a Muslim woman accused of witness intimidation was ordered by a judge to take off her veil when giving evidence. Landmark ruling: Separately, Judge Peter Murphy said on Monday that a Muslim woman must remove her full-face veil while giving evidence in court . He told her it was ‘crucial’ that the jury could see her facial . expressions during testimony and cross-examination, but agreed her . identity should be screened from the rest of the court. Preston Crown Court was told that Lorgat, who worked as a  purchasing . officer at Blackburn College, used a college credit card to steal money . earmarked for  student equipment in a systematic fraud lasting almost . four years. She spent the cash on a holiday to Florida, a trip to Alton . Towers, solicitors’ bills for her divorce and home improvements. The thefts were uncovered in February last year when another member of . staff noticed discrepancies on the credit card bills. Bosses launched an . internal audit and Lorgat was suspended. Among the personal items  Lorgat paid for on the college account were . £9,031 worth of travel costs, solicitors’ bills totalling £2,464 and . £8,473 on tradesmen. Lorgat, who claimed she started using the credit . card following the breakdown of her 20-year marriage, voluntarily . removed the niqab before entering the dock. She pleaded guilty to 19 counts of fraud by abuse of position and has since been sacked. Lorgat’s neighbour Hawa Hamid said: ‘I’m just very shocked. 'When I’ve . seen her in the neighbourhood she’s only been wearing a head scarf. ‘I . don’t think I’ve seen her wear a veil so I don’t know why she would wear . one outside court. 'Presumably she did not want anyone to recognise . her.’ Opinion: Home Secretary Theresa May (pictured last week) said the Government should not tell women what to wear, amid ongoing debate over the use of full-face veils . Release: Police officers at Lancashire Constabulary (headquarters pictured) issued Lorgat's mugshot without her face covering - and insisted that frauds like the crimes she committed would 'not be tolerated' A senior source with Greater Manchester Police told the Mail yesterday: . ‘The ignominy of appearing in the dock at court accused of a crime has . led to some women deciding to wear a veil to and from court to escape . the glare of the public eye.’ The source added: ‘On appearance in the dock they have been asked to . remove the veil to address either the magistrates or judge and have . willingly done so.' BORIS Johnson yesterday said it was ‘totally wrong’ for Muslim schools to force pupils as young as 11 to wear veils and burkas. The Mayor of London said they should not be compulsory, adding: ‘I don’t think it can be classed as any kind of uniform.’ ‘That is against my principles and it’s against the principles of liberty that London should stand for.’ A row broke out after it was claimed that some independent secondary schools order girls to wear burkas outside school and headscarves in class. Two London schools, the £3,000-a-year Ayesha Siddiqa Girls School in Southall and the £1,900-a-year Madani Girls School in Whitechapel, were both said to enforce strict Muslim uniform policies. But teachers at Madani last night said the rules had been misinterpreted and that pupils were not forced to wear full-face veils.","Shaheda Lorgat, 49, arrived at Preston Crown Court wearing covering .

"Lord Robert Winston, an IVF expert, has today warned some clinics are 'exploiting' infertile women . A fertility expert has today hit out at the 'exportation' of infertile women by some clinics. IVF pioneer Lord Robert Winston told peers in the House of Lords, that regulation by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority allowed for 'entirely unvalidated experimental treatment'. Giving an example, Lord Winston said many clinics advertise on the London Underground and 'some have relationships to do work overseas in other clinics, which are not allowed by British regulation'. The Labour peer urged Health Minister Earl Howe to investigate and respond to this 'burning issue' and the' exploitation of infertile women'. Lord Howe told him: 'I recognise the importance of the issue which you have raised and some of those issues are extremely troubling.' The minister said he did not have an up-to-date statement on the policy position the Government was taking but promised to write to Lord Winston. Lord Winston was recently reported to have warned that a growing market for fertility treatments could 'threaten our humanity', including if the rich were able to pay for so-called 'designer babies'. The fertility expert who developed key advancements in IVF treatment told fellow academics at a conference last month 'we have been carried away' by breakthroughs in reproduction. He claimed a ‘toxic’ climate had been created by the desperation of childless couples and the pace of scientific developments in the booming IVF industry. Lord Winston, who is instantly recognisable from his TV programmes such as Child of Our Time and The Human Body, told the fertility conference that new genetic screening technologies meant scientists working with IVF needed to be particularly aware of the danger of eugenics becoming more prevalent. Taking aim at fertility colleagues and patients, he said: ‘One of the problems with our work is that we have been carried away with massive enthusiasms in reproduction. 'That mixture of enthusiasm and patient desperation is actually a very toxic and heady mixture. It is worthwhile standing back a little from the technologies that we employ. ‘One of the issues of the market is that rich people may well be able to afford, in due course, the kind of enhancement to their genetics that other poor people may not be able to afford.’ The Labour peer urged Health Minister Earl Howe to investigate and respond to this 'burning issue' and the' exploitation of infertile women'","The Labour peer warned of 'entirely unvalidated experimental treatment'

"Cosmetics tycoon Leonard Lauder has donated his $1billion collection of Cubist art to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Chairman Emeritus of the Estee Lauder company has pledged 78 works including pieces from Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque and Juan Gris - said to be one of the world's foremost collections of Cubist art. Along with the donation, described by museum director Thomas Campbell as 'truly inspirational', Mr Lauder has also contributed funds to a $22million research centre for modern art which will bear his name. Generous donation: Cosmetics tycoon Leonard Lauder, left, has donated 78 Cubist works to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, including Pablo Picasso's 1914 sculpture 'Le verre díabsinthe (The Absinthe Glass)', right . Exhibition: The works, regarded as one of the foremost collections of Cubist art in the world, will go on display at the museum (pictured) next year . The collection, which will go on display at the museum in 2014, includes 33 works by Pablo Picasso, 17 by Georges Braque, and 14 each from Juan Gris and Fernand Léger. Some of its most esteemed pieces include Picasso's The Scallop Shell from 1912, Eva's Woman in an Armchair from 1913 and Braque's Trees at L'Estaque from 1908. Mr Campbell, director of the museum, said: 'Leonard's gift is truly transformational for the Metropolitan Museum. 'Although the Met is unique in its ability to exhibit over 5,000 years of art history, we have long lacked this critical dimension in the story of modernism. Iconic: Among the 78 works donated by Mr Lauder is Georges Braque's 1908 'Arbres a líEstaque (Trees at LíEstaque)', pictured left, and Fernand Leger's 1914 'Le fumeur (The Smoker)', right . 'Now, Cubism will be represented with some of its greatest masterpieces, demonstrating both its role as the groundbreaking movement of the 20th century and the foundation for an artistic dialogue that continues today. 'This is an extraordinary gift to our Museum and our City.' Mr Lauder said of his donation in a statement: 'This is a gift to the people who live and work in New York and those from around the world who come to visit our great arts institutions. 'The arts are a cornerstone of the cultural, educational, and economic vitality of the City. 'I selected the Met as the way to share this collection because I feel that it’s essential that Cubism—and the art that follows it, for that matter— be seen and studied within the collections of one of the greatest encyclopedic museums in the world. 'The Met’s collection of modernism, together with those of MoMA, the Guggenheim, and the Whitney, reinforce the City’s standing as the center for 20th century art and fuel New York’s ongoing role as the art capital of the world.' Mr Lauder, who is worth an estimated $7.9billion, began his collection in 1976 and made his most recent purchase - a Juan Gris collage - only last month. He has pledged to continue to add to the museum's collection by buying additional works. Influential: Pablo Picasso is pictured in the 1960s . Cubism was the most influential art movement of the 20th century: it radically destroyed traditional illusionism in painting, revolutionized the way we see the world (as Juan Gris said), and paved the way for the pure abstraction that dominated Western art for the next 50 years. Led by Picasso and Braque, the Cubists dismantled traditional perspective and modeling in the round in order to emphasize the two-dimensional picture plane. Cubist collage introduced fragments of mass-produced popular culture into pictures, thereby changing the very definition of art. More than half of the Lauder Collection focuses on the six-year period, 1909-14, during which Braque and Picasso - the two founders of the Cubist movement - closely collaborated. Their partnership began in earnest in the fall of 1908, when the visionary dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler exhibited Braque’s most recent paintings in his Paris gallery. Henri Matisse is known to have disparaged Braque’s pictures as 'painting made of small cubes' and the term Cubism first appeared in print in Louis Vauxcelles’s review of the Kahnweiler exhibition. The Lauder Collection includes two landscapes from this historic show: Terrace at the Hotel Mistral, l’Estaque (1907), which marks Braque’s transition from Fauvism to Cubism, and the iconic Trees at L’Estaque (1908), which inaugurates Cubism. By 1909, Braque and Picasso were inseparable. As Picasso later recounted: 'Almost every evening, either I went to Braque’s studio or he came to mine. Famous: Pablo Picasso's Still Life with a Cake . 'Each of us HAD to see what the other had done during the day. 'We criticized each other’s work. A canvas wasn’t finished until both of us felt it was.' A pair of identically sized paintings from 1911 the Lauder Collection - Braque’s Bottle and Clarinet and Picasso’s Pedestal Table with Wine Glasses, Cup, and Mandolin - exemplify a pivotal moment in the history of Cubism when the two artists began to picture objects from different points of view in an increasingly shallow space. Only a few clues were retained to help viewers decode the picture, the profile of an instrument or the tassel of a curtain. As the works hovered on the brink of illegibility, Braque and Picasso began to introduce 'certainties', as Braque called them: painted letters and words and, soon after, actual pieces of rope, newspaper, sheet music, and brand labels. They inspired other artists to incorporate all kinds of unorthodox materials into works of art.

"Archaeologists have found an astonishing piece of Neolithic artwork that was buried for 4,500 years. The stone creation - which is decorated on both sides and has been described as one of the ‘finest ever’ to be found in Britain - was uncovered last night on the Ness of Brodgar in Orkney, Scotland. It was found at the base of the south-west internal corner of the Neolithic ‘cathedral’ at the site, which covers 2.5 hectares and is believed to have been occupied from as early as 3,500BC. Impressive: The stone art work - which is decorated on both sides and has been described as one of the 'finest ever' to be found in Britain - was uncovered last night on the Ness of Brodgar in Orkney, Scotland . Ancient: The other side of the stone, whch was found at the base of the south-west internal corner of the Neolithic 'cathedral' at the site, which covers 2.5 hectares and is believed to have been occupied from 3500BC . Neolithic man built a vast temple complex at the Ness of Brodgar, with some parts constructed more than 5,000 years ago, even before the Ancient Egyptians had started building the pyramids. Excavations began in 2003 at the site, which has provided evidence of housing, decorated stone slabs, a massive stone wall with foundations, and a large building described as a Neolithic cathedral. Once protected by two giant walls, each more than 330ft long and 13ft high, the complex at the Ness  of Brodgar contained more than a dozen large temples, with one measuring almost 270 sq ft. They were linked to outhouses and kitchens by carefully constructed stone pavements. The bones of sacrificed cattle, elegantly made pottery and pieces of painted ceramics lie scattered there.

Digging: Excavations began in 2003 at the site, which has provided evidence of housing, decorated stone slabs, a massive stone wall with foundations, and a large building described as a Neolithic cathedral . But the exact purpose of the complex is a mystery. The stone has been described as better than previous examples of Neolithic artwork found at Skara Brae and Maeshowe in the 1970s and 1980s. The people of the Neolithic, the new . Stone Age, were the first farmers in Britain, and they arrived on Orkney . about 6,000 years ago. They . cultivated the land, built farmsteads and rapidly established a vibrant . culture, erecting giant stone circles, chambered communal tombs, and a . giant complex of buildings. As recently as May 2012 it was discovered that they were responsible for inventing raving. In gatherings equivalent to the Glastonbury Festival, the men of the age would spend several days eating, drinking and dancing. Herds of cattle were slaughtered to provide food and dancing would continue late into the night during the summer months. An online diary kept by archeologists at the site said today: ‘[This is] perhaps the finest piece of art we have recovered from the site, and one of the finest from the UK ever, amazing and awe inspiring. ‘As we slowed to draw breath at the beauty of the revealed panel, a cry went up that an equally impressive design was apparent on one of the other sides of this large triangular block of stone. ‘Although the basis of the designs of interconnecting triangles can be loosely paralleled on a slab discovered at Skara Brae in the 1970s, a lightly inscribed stone in Maeshowe discovered by Patrick Ashmore in the 1980s and some Irish art. 'This is a much finer and more complex piece of art. ‘Many of the triangles are filled with cross-hatching and other designs. An initial wash has also revealed a finely incised chevron design and small cup marks.’","Stone uncovered last night on the Ness of Brodgar in Orkney, Scotland ."
"Manuel Pellegrini insists Stevan Jovetic still has a future at Manchester City despite axing the Montenegro star from his Champions League squad. Jovetic is said to be devastated after he was sacrificed to make room for new £28million signing Wilfried Bony. City are restricted to only 16 ‘foreign’ players in their European squad as punishment for breaching Financial Fair Play regulations. Pellegrini said: ‘It is always difficult to take a player out of the list but we have restrictions this year. We brought Bony because I think that we need another striker, a box player, and in the position of Jovetic maybe we have some other options. It is a difficult decision but I think it was the best for the squad.’ Stevan Jovetic has been dropped from Manchester City's Champions League squad . The City players trained ahead of Saturday's fixture at the Etihad Stadium against Hull City . Manuel Pellegrini (centre) has said that Jovetic is still part of his future plans at the Etihad . However City had to make way for £28million signing Wilfried Bony, here in action for the Ivory Coast . Bony, signed from Swansea, has leaped ahead of Jovetic in the Manchester City pecking order . Jovetic has struggled to hold down a first-team place at the Etihad since joining from Fiorentina for £22m in the summer of 2013. City turned down a loan offer from Juventus during the January transfer window but it is understood that the Premier League champions would have considered selling the 25-year-old if they could have recouped their money. Pellegrini confirmed that the player’s situation would be assessed in the summer but does not think that his exclusion from the Champions League squad means that he will definitely leave the Etihad. ‘No, I don’t think that one thing has a link with the other thing,’ said the City boss. ‘It is very important for Stevan to try to play now until the end of the season to play as much games as he can and not be injured and try to have a high performance every time he plays. After the end of the season, we analyse not only for Stevan, for all the squad which will continue the next year. ‘He will be a positive player. He continues being very important player. if we didn’t have the restrictions we’d have another place. He’s a good professional and I’m sure we’ll see him playing in the Premier League.

The City players were in a jubilant mood before heading out to the pitches at City's luxury training complex . ‘He will be a positive player. For him, it is more important for him not to play all the games but to play as well as he can in the games he plays.’ City trail leaders Chelsea by five points following their draw at Stamford Bridge last weekend ahead of Saturday’s game at home to Hull City. Pellegrini, who confirmed that both Samir Nasri and Eliaquim Mangala are fit after injury, acknowledged that his team did not play well in January but believes they remain within striking distance of the title. He added: ‘When you have to play 45 points more, you can close the gap, of course you can do it. But is important for our team to try and be near the top of the table as soon as you can, and the only thing you can do is to improve your performance, to repeat what we did in December and wait until Chelsea drop points. Zabaleta concentrates as he selects his footwear before the chilly training session in Manchester . Martin Demichelis was wrapped up warm as he picked up his boots from the plentiful boot room . ‘The last two times this team won the title was coming from behind so I suppose we can do it for a third time. ‘January was not a good month. We changed again our style of play. We had to arrange our team without strikers. We arrange it. After that the strikers came back and they have to have to have minutes again. The Chelsea game will be a switch of performance because we played a very good game playing away against the best team of the Premier League. I am sure we will see the team again we are normally used to seeing. ‘I am sure that playing as we did against Chelsea and recovering the goals we score at home, we are going to be an important team from now until the end.’ Bacary Sagna, pictured with Chelsea's Brazilian playmaker Oscar, was also considered for exclusion .","Stevan Jovetic has been left out of Man City's Champions League squad .

"For the gold-medal Olympians, their future post-Games holds exciting prospects of TV interviews, book deals and lucrative endorsements. But what of those who made a less than glorious impact in London? Enter American distance runner Morgan Uceny who was in fine form for a medal in the 1,500-meter final last Friday, when she was tripped from behind on the last lap and sent sprawling across the track. It was a memorable, if disappointing, exit which saw the distraught Uceny pound her palms against the track in frustration before erupting into tears. Taking a tumble: Morgan Uceny of the United States falls during the women's 1500m final on Day 14 of the London 2012 Olympic Games . Crashing down: Uceny appeared to have had her heels clipped when she landed on the track and lost all hopes of a medal . Battling on: The other runners leap to avoid the Californian track star who was left sprawled on the ground in front of thousands of spectators . Following the race, Uceny said: 'I still don't know what happened. I've heard a few different things from people, but can't say definitively what or who caused the fall. I remember running in Lane 2 to try to avoid the crowding behind me. I was in a great position at the bell and was feeling great. 'Once I hit the ground, I was just devastated.' She was on her hands and knees, staring at the track in disbelief, when Asli Cakir Alptekin of Turkey won the race. For Uceny, from Mammoth Lakes, California, this was another painful moment at a major competition. She also fell at the world championships last summer. After her race, Uceny walked off the track with blood dripping from her . leg and into the medical area. She left the stadium without talking to . anyone. However if it's any consolation to the runner, she was far from the only Olympic athlete to make a disappointing exit from the Games. Frustration: The runner pounds the track in rage after she crashed out of the race after years of hard work and commitment . Shattered: With bloodied knees from her fall, Morgan Uceny leaves the track at the London Games after her disappointing exit . Defending Olympic weightlifting champion Matthias Steiner had a lucky escape earlier in the Games when he dropped his 432 pound barbell onto his neck. Losing his balance on his second lift of the competition, Steiner couldn't sustain the weights above his head during the snatch portion on the platform.Falling awkwardly as the barbell landed on top of him, medical personnel rushed to his aid and hastily erected a shield around him while he was tended to. The crowd waited anxiously for any sign that the 29-year-old had come through the dramatic accident and the German eventually staggered to his feet and waved to them before walking into the back room. He did not emerge for his third attempt and an announcer told the crowd that the 2008 Olympic champion was being taken to a hospital for a precautionary x-ray on his neck. Painful exit: German weightlifter Matthias Steiner loses his balance as the 432lb barbell lands on his neck on August 7 . Agony: The defending world champion grimaces in pain as the weight lands on him - he forfeited his title at London 2012 . America made the men's 4x400 meter relay final at the Olympics despite the fact that runner Manteo Mitchell broke his leg half way round the track. The 25-year-old athlete took the first leg of America's heat and although he finished with a limp there was no obvious sign of the pain he was feeling. He said afterwards: 'I got out pretty slow, but I picked it up and when I got to the 100-metre mark it felt weird. As soon as I took the first step past the 200-meter mark, I felt it break. I heard it. 'I even put out a little war cry, but the crowd was so loud you couldn't hear it. I knew if I finished strong we could still get it (the baton) around. I saw Josh Mance motioning me in for me to hand it off to him, which lifted me. Keep on running: Olympic relay runner Manteo Mitchell broke his leg in the middle of the men's 4x400 race... but just kept going to pass the baton . Through the pain barrier: Mitchell runs towards American teammate Joshua Mance during the men's relay heats shortly after breaking his leg . 'I didn't want to let those three guys down, or the team down, so I just ran on it. It hurt so bad.' Mitchell's decision to go through the pain barrier allowed his U.S. team mates to sprint to a joint finish with the Bahamas in identical times of 2 minutes 58.87 seconds, the fastest ever run in the first round of the relay at the Olympic Games. And not every diving performance was a show of grace and athleticism either. Germany's Stephan Feck attempted a somersault, but lost the grip on one leg which saw him spin out of control and land flat on the water flat on his back with a huge thud on August 7. Precarious: Germany's Stephan Feck teeters on the edge of the springboard during the men's three-meter dive preliminary round but loses his balance... ... before landing with a splash in the swimming pool to loud gasps from the crowd (and a lot of zeroes from the judges) He climbed out of the pool apparently . unhurt after huge gasps from the crowd during the men's three-meter . springboard, but received zeroes from all the judges. There was also devastation for China's hurdling hopeful Liu Xiang after he hit the first obstacle in the 110-metre event. Xiang limped out at the starting line in front of his home crowd four years ago in Beijing with an Achilles problem and fell hard at the first obstacle in the race this year. Xiang, who had been one of the gold medal favorites, crashed into the first hurdle, aggravating an already weakened Achilles, and was eliminated from the race. The qualifying round of the men's pole vault took a dramatic turn when Cuba's Lazaro Borges saw his pole snap in mid-flight. Thankfully, the athlete did not appear hurt after the incident - which was replayed many times for TV audiences. Hitting the deck: Chinese hurdler Liu Xiang, left, and Hungary's Balazs Baji were early fallers in the men's 110m hurdles on Tuesday . Carnage: Xiang, Poland's Artur Noga, Barbados' Shane Braithewaite (second right) and Senegal's Moussa Dembele (far right) all failed to finish the hurdling race . Unlucky break: Lazaro Borges of Cuba's pole snaps as he competes in the men's pole vault qualifier on day 12 of the Games .

"When Tracey Emin failed to win the 1999 Turner Prize, she knew who to blame: herself. Her candid, uncontrollable and sometimes foul mouth in particular. Executives at Channel 4, who were televising the prize-giving ceremony, had phoned the night before and said: ‘If you do win, you cannot swear.’ They couldn’t trust her to behave — and, in her own heart, she couldn’t trust herself. On the night, the 35-year-old told reporters: ‘I knew I wouldn’t win… art is not my strong point, life is… I’m a brilliant loser.’ Shocking: When My Bed by Tracey Emin was revealed, it appalled the critics. But it became symbolic . She may not have won the £20,000 prize, but her entry My Bed, made her infinitely more famous than the other shortlisted artists and confirmed her as the First Ladette of British art. The ladette was a late-1990s phenomenon. The name was coined after a marketing study found 550,000 of 2 million young adults who were single, drinking more than eight pints a week, and had laddish attitudes — were women. She was an alarming creature: beery, sweary, football-mad and promiscuous. Able to drink any man under the table, then eat his share of  the chips and kebab on the way home. Emin’s bed was a devastating depiction of this very modern woman’s lifestyle. Boozy: Tracey Emin couldn't be trusted to accept the Turner Prize without swearing . When it was first exhibited, her unmade double bed strewn with straggly tights, used condoms, worn knickers, cigarette butts, vodka bottles, scrunched tissues, greying slippers and a forlorn toy dog appalled critics. Gallery-goers queued to see it, fascinated by its dirtiness and delinquency. So great were visitor numbers that Tate Britain had to re-design the exhibition space to give more room to the work. One letter to a broadsheet newspaper from a retired gentleman from Cirencester fumed that Emin’s bed ‘so clearly demonstrates the decline in orderly, ethical and moral standards which seems to me to have been constant since the cessation of National Service.’ The bed became an instant symbol of slobbish modern morals. Earlier this week it was announced that the work by Emin — now a CBE and aged 50 — will be sold at auction by Christie’s over the summer for an estimated £1.2 million. It comes from the collection of Charles Saatchi, adman, art collector and ex-husband of Nigella Lawson, who bought it for a remarkable £150,000 in 2000. Before the bed, Emin was best-known for two other, shocking, things. The first was a work exhibited at the aptly-named Sensation exhibition organised by Saatchi in 1997 called Everyone I Have Ever Slept With — a tent embroidered with the names of everyone she’d shared a bed with. The second was her appearance on a late-night arts panel show that same year, riotously drunk and unspeakably rude. After announcing she wanted to phone her mum and swearing, she removed her microphone with fumbling fingers and wobbled off set while a fellow guest valiantly tried to keep up a conversation about J M W  Turner’s great storm paintings. Legacy: The popularity of her bed must have frustrated Emin (pictured in 2011), who is in fact a talented artist . When My Bed was unveiled, ‘Mad Tracey from Margate’ as she called herself became the most famous artist in Britain and a lightning conductor for fury about contemporary British art. The bed was the product of a chaotic low point in Emin’s always chaotic life. A failed romance had resulted in severe depression. She drank too much, slept around, smoked a lot and ate almost nothing. Her weight had dropped to just six-and-a-half stone. One morning, after the binge to end all binges, she woke up dry-mouthed, dizzy and certain that if she didn’t drink some water she would die. Crawling back from the bathroom and catching sight of the bed she thought: ‘Ugghh!’ Then, she later recalled, her view . changed: the bed went from looking horrible to beautiful, even . classical. ‘From a distance,’ she said, ‘it looked like a painting' Then, she later recalled, her view changed: the bed went from looking horrible to beautiful, even classical. ‘From a distance,’ she said, ‘it looked like a painting.’ When, shortly afterwards, she was nominated for the Turner Prize and asked to submit new works to the exhibition, she had the idea of recreating the bed with all its mess in the Tate’s handsome, colonnaded gallery on London’s Millbank. In the press coverage that followed, the three other Turner short-listers were eclipsed. The winner, unassuming video artist Steve McQueen was barely mentioned. Emin may have stolen his thunder on the night, but earlier this year, his feature film 12 Years A Slave won the Best Picture Oscar. The bed’s notoriety was aided by a headline-grabbing stunt by two Chinese-born satirists, Yuan-Cai and Jian Jun Xi, who gleefully jumped up and down on it before being grabbed by police. Now that the bed is to be auctioned, there is talk about whether it should be ‘saved for the nation’. Earlier this week, the Guardian said ‘the sale is likely to be the last opportunity for the bed to be secured for a public museum in Britain.’ Legend: Should the unmade bed be 'saved for the nation', as was argued in the Guardian's pages this week? While art-lovers can warm to campaigns to stop works by Thomas Gainsborough or John Constable from being sold to foreign collectors, it is hard to see why more than a million should be raised to keep Emin’s grubby tights here. The fact is that My Bed, although Emin’s most well-known work, has little to recommend it. In the mind of the public, all her other art has been smothered beneath the bed’s unwashed blankets. This must gall Emin, who is a talented draughtsman. Her unsettling sketches of nudes and of the  Margate sea-front in Kent have a scraggly, whimsical beauty. Sedate activity: But Tracey Emin once drank lager and spirits, not wine or cocktails. The bed required no such skill. As many mothers pointed out in newspaper letters pages at the time, they had teenagers whose bedrooms were as messy as Emin’s. Her artwork is valuable more for what it tells us about a particular sort of young woman and a particular culture in the late-1990s. The ladette poster girls were the DJs Sara Cox and Zoe Ball and TV presenter Denise Van Outen. They were endlessly photographed ‘’aving it large’ at London clubs. On the morning of her wedding to DJ Fatboy Slim, Ball appeared in a midriff-bearing top and jeans, clutching a bottle of Jack Daniels, a cigarette hanging from her lips. Denise Van Outen, then starring on Channel 4’s The Big Breakfast, flashed her bra near Prince Charles at a pop concert. I was aged eleven at the time, too young to be influenced by the ladettes but old enough read about them in the pages of Heat magazine. A survey about twenty-something singles concluded that a ladette ‘changes her man more often than her duvet cover.’ She drank lager and spirits rather than wine or cocktails. This was the era, too, of lurid, sickly alcopops: Bacardi Breezers and WKDs. The ladette bible was Cosmopolitan magazine, with its ‘real-life sex confessions’. Circulation rose through the 1990s, peaking at 476,288 in December 1998. Tracey Emin lived this lifestyle: late nights, cigarettes and coffee for breakfast, casual sexual encounters, swearing in interviews. Every part of her life was put on display. Nothing was private. Revealing: Every part of the artist's life was on display, something she took to extremes in much of her work . In the room next to the bed at the Tate was a video in which she told of a botched abortion in searing detail. Doctors had not realised she was pregnant with twins, and sent her home still carrying a second baby. She collapsed in agony hours later and lost the other child. She confessed to sexually transmitted infections and revealed her favourite sexual position. Once, she was questioned by police after allegedly pulling another woman’s hair in the loos at a party. She signed an advertising contract with Becks beer and appeared naked on bottle labels. And she poured this harum-scarum life into her art. It has often been ugly; the bed, downright depressing. There is a loneliness about it — it is, after all an empty bed — and a sense of regret about a life which is missing the reassurance of order and stability. But what she achieved with that bed, the most famous work of art not to win the Turner Prize, was to depict a social type: the unrepentant, though perhaps not terribly happy, ladette. In its way, it is a sad and devastating modern equivalent of William Hogarth’s Gin Lane — a grotesque satire on drunkenness, squalor and poverty in the 18th century. The work by Tracey Emin has negligible artistic value, but as a record of bad behaviour at the turn of the millennium, there is nothing to rival her unmade bed.","Legendary unmade bed bought by Charles Saatchi for £150,000 in 2000 .

"Former Vanderbilt football player Cory Batey has said he does not think he should serve life behind bars for gang-raping an unconscious student because it wasn't 'a good representation of who I am'. Batey, 21, was found guilty of aggravated rape last month after assaulting the student in a dorm room with three other football players following a night of drinking in June 2013 - in a horrific attack caught on camera. In an exclusive interview with Dr Phil - which will air in full on Monday - Batey became emotional as he said he knows he has let down his mother, but that he would not have gone down the same route if he had had a father figure growing up. He added that he hopes his victim and her family can forgive him for his mistake. Locked up: Cory Batey, who was convicted last month of raping an unconscious student in a dorm room with three other men, said he was sorry for his actions as he spoke out from prison . The 21-year-old former football player spoke with Dr Phil in the exclusive interview, which will air on Monday . Still, when asked by Dr Phil if he believes he should stay in prison for the rest of his life - which is a possibility when he is sentenced next month - he responded: 'I don’t think I should.' He added that he does not believe his fellow rapist Brandon Vandenburg, who brought the woman back to the dorm and encouraged the others to rape her, should not be locked up for life either. 'I think everyone deserves to be forgiven and to be given a second chance,' he said. 'I don't think that was a clear representation of him. I know that's not a clear representation of me.' When Dr Phil pressed him over the assault, in which he urinated over the woman and laughed as she was raped by the other men and sodomized by a plastic bottle, he said he had not been himself. 'I was drunk out of my mind so I don't think I was thinking,' he said. 'That's just not a clear representation of who I am.' He went on: 'My whole life, I feel like I've always been a caring individual to look out for the helpless or the less fortunate... That just wasn't my heart. That just wasn't me.' He also defended Vandenburg, 21. Guilty: Batey and Brandon Vandenburg, who was also convicted, are pictured in mugshots after the verdict . 'Honestly, I think he's a good kid,' he told Dr Phil. 'I think he just got caught up in some unfortunate circumstances.' At one point in the interview, he suggested that if he had had a father figure, he would not have ended up on this road. His father died of cancer when Batey was nine. 'I would like to think I wouldn't be in this position if he was alive, honestly,' he said. 'I just think a man needs his father at a certain point in life to mold him and discipline him and I think I missed out on that and I kind of had to choose my own direction you know.' But when asked about his mother - who has worked at Vanderbilt for 37 years - he started to cry. 'I embarrassed her,' he said. 'I embarrassed her.' When the jury was shown the graphic videos during the trial, he said he couldn't bring himself to look at his mother, who was in the courtroom. 'I could not look at her,' he said. 'Because I knew that’s not who she raised and I disappointed her more than anything.' He cried as Dr Phil asked him about the impact his arrest had on his mother, who works at Vanderbilt . Batey, who is one of 13 children, said that his mother has told him that she knows that he made a mistake and did something wrong but 'we'll be okay eventually'. When Dr Phil quizzed him about his victim, he said she hoped she could see past what he did to her. Happier times: Batey is pictured with his mother, who has worked at Vanderbilt for 37 years . 'I wish she could really know the type of person I am,' he said. 'I hate that she had to see me in that light and think I’m that person, because I'm not. When I saw that stuff, I was just praying, I was just saying, ""Lord just put it in her heart to forgive me, because that's not me. It’s just not me"".' 'I wished I could take it all back,' he added. 'I wish there’s a button that, that I could just delete everything, but unfortunately there’s not. And I’m sorry she’s had to go through this... I just hope [her family] can find it in their heart to just forgive me.' Batey, who was dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit for the interview, was found guilty of aggravated rape and aggravated sexual battery. He faces up to 60 years behind bars when he is sentenced alongside Vandenburg on March 6. 'I think everyone deserves to be forgiven and to be given a second chance,' he said. It took the jurors just three hours to convict the men. After the verdict, three of the jurors spoke out and revealed that they made their decisions early on in the case after seeing cell phone footage of the attack. 'As soon as we saw the videos and photographic evidence... we knew exactly who was guilty of what and what we were going to come back with,' Todd Easter told ABC News. 'What we knew is that a terrible crime had occurred.' Another juror, Dr. Deirde Young, said watching the footage - which showed Vandenburg egging on Batey and two other men as the woman lay unconscious - made her feel 'awful.' Sadness: Batey's mother looked on in shock after her son was found guilty of aggravated rape. In the interview with Dr Phil, he became emotional as he described his shame at his mother knowing what he had done . Shock: Batey says goodbye to his attorney Worrick Robinson after being found guilty on January 27 . 'I asked myself, ""how could they do this to that young lady?""' Young added. 'There can't be enough explanation to me. I don't know, I think they need to do some real soul searching. I've never experienced anything like these young men.' In the trial, the victim had testified that Vandenburg, whom she was dating, plied her with alcohol one night in June 2013 and the next thing she remembers is waking up in a strange dorm room. After dragging her to his dorm room, Vandenburg switched on porn and encouraged Batey and two others to assault the woman with a water bottle and rape her, prosecutors said. The jury was shown graphic cell phone footage of part of the sexual attack, which the men had recorded. Vandenburg then sent some footage to friends. One of the men, Brandon Banks, allegedly anally raped the woman with the water bottle as Vandenburg said, 'squeeze that s***', the video showed. Batey then allegedly urinated on her. Former life: Batey, left, and Vandenburg, right, are pictured in their headshots for Vanderbilt's football team . Accused: Two of their other former teammates, Brandon Banks, left, and Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie, right, are also accused in the case but have yet to stand trial . She woke up the next day in a friend's dorm room and felt sore but did not know she had been sexually assaulted until she saw the footage of the attack. During the trial, Batey's attorney had argued that his client was not capable of making decisions because he had consumed so much alcohol. Batey drank as many as 22 drinks that night. Vandenburg's attorney had argued that his client was not guilty of rape because he was physically unable to rape the girl after a night of drinking. The victim was in the courtroom for the verdict, and began crying as the two men were declared guilty on all counts. Two other men, Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie and Brandon Banks, have also been charged in the incident but a trial date for their case has not yet been announced.","Cory Batey, 21, raped an unconscious student with three other men in a Vanderbilt dorm in June 2013 - in a horrific attack partly caught on camera .

"Buyers: Sol Campbell, 40, and his wife Fiona, 34 snapped up the six-storey townhouse in Chelsea . Having threatened to leave the country over Labour’s proposed mansion tax, it was perhaps of little surprise when Sol Campbell put his Chelsea townhouse up for sale. Far more surprising was the identity of the purchaser of the former football star’s £20million property – himself. The six-storey home on the banks of the Thames was bought by company H Wall Ltd, which the former England international, 40, jointly owns with his wife, interior designer Fiona Barratt-Campbell, 34. It was first listed for sale in October last year for £25million. The sale included a mews property, where the couple’s housekeeper lives, which is joined to the main home by a tunnel. Campbell, who has a number of other properties, including a Northumberland mansion, put the Chelsea house on the market just weeks after he blasted the Labour Party’s mansion tax policy, which he described as a ‘cheap and easy way to extract money from individuals who have done well.’ Land Registry documents suggest the sale was registered on December 5 last year, a day after higher stamp duty levies came into effect. It is possible the sale took place shortly before it was registered, in which case it may have avoided the greatly increased charges. Companies House documents reveal that the Chelsea house was registered to company NE Properties Ltd. However, Campbell had a mortgage on the house and he has widely referred to it as his own. He does not appear to have any other connection to NE Properties. He has also submitted several planning applications for the house, stretching back over a decade. He let it during the 2012 Olympics for £75,000 per week and, speaking at the time, Mrs Barratt-Campbell told The Telegraph: ‘It has an amazing entertaining space on the first floor, with views of the river and Albert Bridge, which is beautiful when it is lit up at night. We have a garden, a mews house – where our housekeeper and family live and which is connected to the main house by a tunnel under the garden, so it is completely secure.’ The property also boasts its own lift and gym. It has six bedrooms, five bathrooms, a drawing room, library and a 45ft garden. It was renovated in 2008, with Mrs Barratt-Campbell designing the interior. She is the granddaughter of Sir Lawrie Barratt, who founded Barratt Homes. Criticising the mansion tax last year, Campbell told the BBC: ‘Over the years I have spent millions in income tax and stamp duty but I am being punished for investing in a property portfolio. I see this as a tax on aspiration.’ Prestigious: The property, pictured, boasts its own lift and has a tunnel to the housekeeper's mews home . View: The six-bedroom home, which also offers a 45ft garden, is on the banks of the Thames, pictured . Ed Miliband claims his flagship policy will raise £1.2billion a year. Those in homes worth between £2million and £3million will pay an extra £3,000 a year in tax. Labour has said those in even more expensive homes will pay still more. Former Arsenal and Tottenham defender Campbell told The Times last month: ‘With a mansion tax, you’re taxing me for being prudent. ‘You’ve got death taxes already. If Labour gets in, I’d leave. I’d have to say, “Sorry, I want to ship out”.’ He reiterated the opinion in a series of angry tweets in September last year. He wrote to his 33,000 followers: ‘MansionTax? Why should we except this? @uklabour are the grim reaper of business entrepreneurs or anyone that has done well!’ Last night tax experts said the complex ownership arrangements made it difficult to work out what the financial benefit for Campbell of selling the Chelsea property to his own company would be. Because Labour has not yet detailed its mansion tax plans it was also unclear how the sale might affect Campbell’s possible bill under the proposed levy.","Campbell threatened to leave country over Labour's proposed mansion tax .

"Thousands of nude videos and images sent using Snapchat could be leaked over the weekend, hackers have warned. Earlier this week, an anonymous 4chan user claimed to have obtained images on Snapchat - the ephemeral messaging service that allows users to send pictures that should disappear after a few seconds. Now, messages posted on the 4chan website suggest that up to 200,000 images will be released soon in an event dubbed ‘The Snappening’. Scroll down for video .

A third-party Snapchat client app has been collecting every photo and video file sent through the message site for years, giving hackers access to a 13GB private library. But Snapchat has denied that its service was ever compromised. 'We can confirm that Snapchat’s servers were never breached and were not the source of these leaks,' Snapchat told MailOnline. 'Snapchatters were victimised by their use of third-party apps to send and receive Snaps, a practice that we expressly prohibit in our Terms of Use precisely because they compromise our users’ security. Earlier this week an anonymous 4chan user claimed to have obtained images on Snapchat, a messaging service that allows users to send pictured that should disappear after a few seconds . To prove that he or she had hacked a third-party app, the poster provided pictures allegedly from Snapchat. But some users have said they can find the images elsewhere. While Snapsave has been named as the third-party app that was hacked into, an anonymous photo trader told Business Insider it was in fact SnapSaved.com . 'We vigilantly monitor the App Store and Google Play for illegal third-party apps and have succeeded in getting many of these removed.' One poster has claimed that the full leak will take place on 12 October, and will be uploaded to a searchable database, which suggests the images will be linked to Snapchat user IDs. The warning was first spotted by blogger Kenny Withers, who described it as ‘one of the largest data breaches of online profiles.’ ‘To put this into perspective, just imagine the celebrity nude scandal,’ he wrote. ‘Now replace iCloud with Snapsave and blow this up by hundreds of thousands of accounts. Now you have the Snappening.’ Co-founder Evan Spiegel  has revealed plans to show adverts on Snapchat . Despite not having a regular source of revenue, Snapchat was recently valued in the region of $10 billion (£6 billion). But its lack of revenue is about to change after co-founder Evan Spiegel revealed plans to show adverts on the app. The 24-year-old developer told Vanity Fair's New Establishment Summit that sponsored posts will appear on Snapchat 'soon', but they'll only show up on the app's Stories feature. Snapchat Stories add Snaps together to create a narrative. When a user adds a Snap to a Story it lives for 24 hours before it disappears, making room for the new. Mr Spiegel said: 'People are going to see the first ads on Snapchat soon. We think they're pretty cool.' He added that the adverts will be opt-in, and users can choose to look at them, or skip. And unlike adverts on Instagram and Facebook, Snapchat's ads would not be targeted at unique users, they will just be added to a story for whoever is looking at the app, at that time. The exact date that the ads will appear was not revealed. To prove that he or she had hacked a third-party app, the poster provided pictures allegedly from Snapchat.

"This October it will be 12 years since 202 people, including 26 Britons, were killed by a terrorist attack in Bali. Polly Brooks, 41, from Guildford, was the only survivor from her group of friends who were at the Sari night club when it was destroyed by bomb blasts. Polly managed to pull herself out of the rubble but her husband Dan Miller, 31, and her best friend Annika Linden, 30, weren't as lucky. Scroll down for video . Limbering up: Bali bomb survivor Polly Brooks will run the Royal Parks Half Marathon next Sunday . Despite the injuries she sustained in the attack making it difficult for her to run, next weekend Polly will take part in the Royal Parks Foundation Half Marathon in London to raise money and awareness for a charity - Dan's Fund for Burns - which she set up in their memory. Recalling the terrible events in 2002, Polly told MailOnline: 'I'm alive to this day because I didn't get knocked unconscious. 'I was on the dance floor when there was a massive explosion above the noise of the disco. There was a short pause when everyone stood and asked ""what was that?"", then there was another explosion but this time there was a massive flash of yellow light. 'I was lifted off my feet. It was like you see in films, I hit the floor and loads of stuff was falling on top of me. I had this moment of sheer terror where I thought ""this is it, I'm dying"". Loss: Polly's first husband, Dan Miller, died in the terrorist attack in 2002. She set up a charity - Dan's Fund for Burns - in his memory and will raise money for it through her half marathon . 'Everything was black apart from the flames and I could hear people screaming. I was under the corrugated iron part of the roof and I was able to pull it off myself and run up and out. 'A beam was crushing my right leg but I managed to pull it off by losing my trousers and shoe. I ran onto the roof in my halter neck top and all I could see was a wall of fire. 'I was on fire myself but I made a run for it and reached a cul-de-sac where some guys from a hotel there rushed to help me.' Polly remained in the cul-de-sac with the other shocked and injured survivors for some time as the night club had collapsed across the road, blocking them in. Describing the horrific scene, Polly said: 'It was awful, there was a guy next to me who had his legs blown off and was writing a letter home to his family. 'People were trying not to scream and nobody knew what had happened. I was able to borrow a mobile phone and call my mum and told her I had lost everyone. 'I asked her to call Annika and Dan's mum to find out if they had called.' Running in their memory: It's 12 years this October since the bombing in Bali which killed 202 people . Survival: Polly managed to pull herself out of the burning building after the roof collapsed on top of her . Support: Polly with her parents Rosemary and Peter when she flew back to Britain after she spent six weeks in hospital being treated for 43 per cent burns . But no-one had heard from either of them and Polly feared the worst. But she would have to wait five days for confirmation that her husband of five weeks and best friend had died. She explained: 'It was chaos afterwards and everyone was sent to different hospitals because the ones in Bali couldn't cope. I was flown to Australia and I just kept hoping Dan and Annika had made it out like I had. 'But I think I knew the truth in my heart, Annika had been right next to me on the dance floor but Dan had been closer to the blast.' Polly and Dan had married just five weeks before the attack. 'I went from an absolute high of getting married to my whole world changing,' she said. The pair had met in Bali two years earlier when Dan was on a rugby tour and Polly was on holiday with friends. Both were living in Hong Kong at the time and they kept their holiday romance going. When they returned to Bali on the rugby tour the following year, Dan proposed. As the Bali rugby tour had become something of a tradition for them, they decided to return again in 2002 just after they had married. In training: Polly has run 11 miles in preparation for the race but finds running difficult because of her scars . Polly said: 'We shouldn't have gone back to Bali but it was the same rugby tour. We thought ""it's our place, we should go"". It was bad decision as all hell broke lose and everything I knew went wrong.' Although Polly made it out of the burning building alive, she suffered 43 per cent burns to her body. She said: 'I was in so much pain I cannot describe it. Imagine what it's like when you burn your finger on an iron, well 43 per cent of my body was burnt and the other half cut up to patch up the burnt bits.' Her physical pain made it hard for her to grieve for her dead husband and friends initially. She explains: 'It really hurt to cry. One of the nurse told me ""you have to focus on yourself and getting better. Grief will come later, you have to dig deep and survive.""' She decided from her hospital bed in Australia that she wouldn't be able to return to the life she shared with Dan in Hong Kong. She would instead go back to the UK and threw herself back into her work as a sales trader in London. She admits she kept herself busy to put off having to deal with her shock and grief. She said: 'I went into overdrive, setting charity up, getting well enough to go back to work. I wanted to keep myself so, so busy. If I kept myself busy I wouldn't have to deal with what happened. I couldn't cope with it so the answer was to keep busy and not think about it.' She added: 'It might sound strange but I felt it was unfair that I had survived. The weight of distress and upset was so huge, I felt the others had got away lightly. They were gone and didn't have to deal with it.' Eventually Polly realised she had to take a step back and process what she had been through. She resigned from her job and sought counselling from experts who had supported the survivors of the London 7/7 attacks. 'Someone told me, ""you can't get your life back exactly how it was, you have to rebuild a new life"". So I started looking forward,' Polly said. New life: Polly is now married to Andy and he and their two children will cheer her on on Sunday . She added that with the support of her friends and family, she was able to accept what had happened and realise she couldn't change it. Towards the end of her counselling, she met Andy Brooks through mutual friends and they fell in love. They married and now have two children, a son, six, and daughter, four. Polly said: 'I am lucky to have met two amazing guys in my life. Andy had to take on the history of what happened to me and the charity is still a big part of my life and he's really supportive of that. He's never been jealous or never thought my scarring was an issue.' Andy will take the children to cheer Polly on as she takes to the streets of London to run her first  (and she believes last!) half marathon next Sunday. She's trained for the event by running up to 11 miles but she admits she hasn't got the running bug. 'I hate running to be honest!' she said.' Because of my burns, the left hand side of my body is quite twisted and slightly shorter than the other side so I have been having physio every two to three weeks to combat that. After having two children, I also didn't realise my pelvis was out of place so I've also been having physio for that. 'I don't suppose I will be doing another half marathon but I really wanted to do it because it falls on the 12th anniversary.'

"Will Carling and Lewis Moody were among those questioning Wales' decision to keep George North on the pitch against England - despite the winger appearing to be knocked out twice. North suffered two head injuries during Wales' 21-16 defeat at the Millennium Stadium in the opening match of the 2015 Six Nations on Friday night. Moody, capped 71 times by England, posted on Twitter: 'Why was George North not taken off - terrible decision by the medics. Out cold.'

The Wales wing appeared to be knocked out twice during his side's 21-16 Six Nations loss against England . BBC commentator and former England international Brian Moore also commented: 'I think he (North) is definitely concussed. I am surprised he has been kept on the field.' Wales coach Warren Gatland though was adamant all the correct medical procedures were followed. After the game, he said: 'Didn't see second-one but George North passed all protocols first time. We'll have to see how he is over next few days.' In the first half, the 22-year-old Northampton Saints winger was inadvertently kicked in the face by England second row Dave Attwood. Despite being given initial treatment and being temporarily replaced by wing Luke Williams for almost five minutes, North returned to the field. His game greatly suffered, however, and he was then seemingly knocked out cold again in the second half. This time, North was attempting to tackle England's Mike Brown with the help of his Wales team-mate Richard Hibbard - but the hooker accidentally smashed his head into the wing's nose. North slumped to the ground, clearly not in control of his own body. He remained on the field for the entire match though, much to the disappointment of many ex-professionals onTwitter.

"An alleged stalker bombarded Channel 4 News presenter Cathy Newman with more than 100,000 Twitter messages and kissed her after following her to the ITN building, a court heard today. Adrian Johnson, 54, allegedly sent the journalist flowers and greeting cards and frequently turned up at Channel 4 News’s central London headquarters. He also terrorised Ms Newman, who has been married to writer John O'Connell since 2001, with scores of emails and text messages after finding out her mobile number, it is claimed. Write caption here . Mr Johnson then took to Twitter to harass the broadcaster with over 100,000 tweets - most sent directly to the former Financial Times reporter, Highbury Corner Magistrates’ heard. Ms Newman, who has previously worked for the Independent and the Washington Post, has since blocked Johnson from her Twitter account. Johnson, with peroxide blonde hair and wearing prescription sunglasses in the dock, spoke only to confirm his name and deny a charge of harassment without violence. Holding a cane and wearing an electric blue jumper, Johnson showed no emotion as he was told he will face trial at the same court in October. ‘The main part of the evidence is from Mr Johnson’s computer - evidence from his Twitter account is in excess of over 100,000 tweets’, Rebecca Cooke, defending, said. ‘He disputes his course of conduct amounted to harassment. ‘The complainant is a Channel 4 News reader who has Twitter and regularly tweets. She has sent emails to the defendant and has also responded to messages on Twitter. ‘The defendant never received a warning of harassment but he has since been blocked from the complainant’s Twitter account’. Ms Newman, 39, will be giving evidence at the two-day trial, which has been provisionally set for October 1. Prosecutor Penny Ferguson said that the Crown would be relying on evidence seized from Johnson’s computer. Johnson was granted bail on condition that he does not contact Ms Newman or go within 50 metres of her, and that he does not attend the ITN building.

"Sky faces losing the lion's share of Premier League live rights . The £4billion fight to show live Barclays Premier League football will go into a second round next week. The bids were tabled for the seven packages — starting in 2016-17 — by a noon deadline on Friday, but there was no immediate verdict from the Premier League, as there was a week earlier for the highlights rights won by BBC. This is because America’s Discovery Channel and maybe even Qatar-based beIN Sports could join BT Sport and Sky in a fierce battle that will not be concluded until Tuesday or Wednesday.

"Published: 22:00, 06 February 2015 |                     Updated: 23:20, 06 February 2015 . England buried their demons in Cardiff last minute – climbing out of a ‘big hole’ at 10-0 down to claim one of the most impressive and significant victories of recent years. This was a momentous result to launch the RBS Six Nations. The visitors were chronically weakened, or that was the theory anyway. Instead, a team deprived of so many leading men trumped rivals who were at full strength and armed with greater experience and pedigree. For a time, the ghosts of England’s record defeat in the same forbidding arena in 2013 appeared to be re-awakening, but this time Chris Robshaw and Co faced them down. This time, there was greater maturity and composed decision-making as the under-dogs turned the tables in ruthless fashion.

Penalties: Ford (3) Jonathan Joseph’s wonderful solo try after half-time was the tipping point in this tense contest and by the end, England were threatening to pull significantly clear of their broken opponents. It was an emphatic reversal of the widely-anticipated script and will ignite a belief among Stuart Lancaster and his squad that this can be the catalyst for a compelling title challenge. The magnitude of the outcome was clear to see from the reactions. High in the stand, Lancaster, Andy Farrell and Graham Rowntree embraced as euphoria swept the Red Rose coaching box. Down below, James Haskell’s first-pumping celebration symbolised the away team’s wild delight. He deserved to cavort with delight. The Wasps captain led England’s cavalry charge of defiance. His ball-carrying and defensive work-rate reached herculean heights. Yet, the victors had several heroes. Joseph justified his recall with a conjuring act which was fully in keeping with his performances for Bath this season – when he scored after the break. Up front, Joe Marler delivered another imposing display and Dave Attwood was another Englishman who appeared to thrive amid the typical hostility. Most of all, there was a collective composure which showed that all the talk of progress since the last visit to these parts was more than mere hot air. Taken in isolation, this was a high point of Lancaster’s tenure; a gallant triumph in the face of injury-induced adversity. In wider context, it will reverberate, not just through this championship but on into the World Cup. It would not have been upper-most in English minds before the game, but they will now feel that if they can conquer Wales in their capital, they can certainly see them off at Twickenham in their Pool A showdown. For Warren Gatland, the second half last night was an alarming spectacle. His team were armed with their multitude of Lions and, despite often being short of attacking cohesion, they had gone into half-time 16-8 up. At home, with a fair share of territory and possession, they would have expected to kick on and lay the foundations for another fine campaign. The atmosphere at the Millennium Stadium was crackling with the pre-match pyrotechnics before the players stepped out onto the pitch .

Instead, they will be condemned to a harsh inquest. The Welsh defence was exposed with worrying regularity, they were caught off-guard by their rivals’ intensity after half-time and perhaps the biggest concern for Gatland was that, among so many established Test figures, there were none of them who could arrest the slide from dominance to defeat. Leigh Halfpenny’s first-minute penalty had set the hosts on their way and in the early stages, there was a sense of strong Welsh conviction and English jitters, and the one-way pressure kept building. Sure enough, the first try went to Wales. The England pack delivered a strong shove at a scrum in their own 22, but their efforts were to no avail. Taulupe Faletau picked up and managed to hold off Haskell, then barged past George Ford before a sensational off-load sent Rhys Webb darting around Jonny May to score on the right. Halfpenny converted and the gap was up to double figures in the eighth minute. Lancaster’s men needed to gain a foothold and they did so in the 15th minute. From a lineout drive, Ford and Ben Youngs probed for gaps before the ball was flung right. Luther Burrell passed on to Mike Brown and the full-back’s clever kick through created the opening for Anthony Watson, who pounced to touch down. Unfortunately for England though, fly-half George Ford's conversion struck the post meaning the score was 10-5 in Wales' favour .

Wales fly-half Dan Biggar (second left) soon restored their eight point advantage executing a drop goal on the stroke of half-time . Ford missed the conversion but was on target with another penalty. At the other end, as a disjointed contest became a stop-start kicking duel, Halfpenny landed his next penalty shot but missed another routine chance, before Dan Biggar’s drop goal sent Wales into half-time in good heart. Their positive mood was shattered four minutes into the second half, as England hit back with a try which was a triumph for patient pressure and sustained force. The forwards softened up the Welsh defence on the left with a series of close-range drives, as the likes of Billy Vunipola, Chris Robshaw and the impressive Haskell made their presence felt. When the ball was shifted in-field, Ford maintained the momentum and Joseph took a pass with several defenders in close attendance. However, the recalled Bath centre stepped around Biggar, shaped to release an over-head off-load and instead twisted past the flailing George North and broke away to score. It was just the sort of spark of creativity he had been selected for and the conversion by his club-mate, Ford, left the visitors just a point behind. Just after the hour, the England No 10 added another penalty to put his side ahead for the first time and it was a deserved revival. Haskell came close to scoring late on and Attwood went over five minutes from time, but his ‘try’ was ruled out for obstruction by replacement Nick Easter earlier in the move. Ultimately, that decision was not decisive, as Ford held his nerve with a 79th -minute penalty to cap the comeback. England’s players lingered for a lap of honour after the final whistle and Lancaster stopped to pose for pictures with delirious visiting supporters as he headed down the tunnel.

"By Friday evening, a picture posted on Instagram by Steven Gerrard, standing next to Jamie Redknapp, had received more than 100,000 likes. It included the message: ‘Learnt so much from this fella coming through, great to see a good mate of mine’. Redknapp was in Liverpool’s midfield when Gerrard played in his first Merseyside derby, as a rampaging substitute in April 1999.

Redknapp interviews the Liverpool captain for Sky's Saturday Night Football programme before the derby . Jamie: It is your 33rd derby. How much are you looking forward to it? Steven: More than ever. It is my favourite game of the season. I enjoy winning at Old Trafford, but Everton is closer. I can feel the hate, the bitterness. If there is one ground where I could pick a win, it is Goodison Park. They are great supporters — and I have a lot of respect for them — but for the hell they give me, this is the place. Jamie: I was playing in your first derby . . . you came on as a sub and played at right back. My dad said afterwards: ‘Your right back can play.’ I said: ‘Wait until you see him play in central midfield, dad!’ Steven: I felt like a kid invited to a man’s game. I looked like a kid and I played like a kid in many ways. When I cleared one off the line, I celebrated like I had scored the winning goal! Being a local lad, I grew up around the derby. My dad is a massive red and my mum’s brother is a massive blue. So for years and years, even before I sampled it for myself, I loved the games. To get a win in that first game (Liverpool won 3-2), it felt like a cup final to me. Redknapp celebrates with Gerrard after scoring against Charlton at The Valley in 2001 .

Steven: That tackle was so bad, I could have been sent off twice. I went out for dinner that night and who should be in the same restaurant? Kevin Campbell. He was a big unit and I wouldn’t fancy a one-on-one with him off the pitch. He put his arm around me, he was great, but my emotion got the better of me in that game.

When I was coming through, once I had a couple of years remaining, my contract would be renewed to avoid the worry. I see Jordan with a year left and Raheem’s (contract situation) in the paper too much and I know there is no smoke without fire. My message to the club is: get these done. Sharpish.

"Stuart Lancaster hailed Friday night's victory over Wales as the most important result of his three-year tenure as England coach. With a heavily depleted squad and huge psychological implications ahead of the World Cup, Lancaster described the 21-16 upset at the Millennium Stadium as the highest point since he took up his role in 2012. Tries from Anthony Watson and Jonathan Joseph helped erase the haunting memories of two years ago, when England missed out on the Grand Slam, and turned the Red Rose side into overnight favourites to win the championship. England head coach Stuart Lancaster has hailed his side's 21-16 win against Wales in the Six Nations . England centre Jonathan Joseph scored the decisive try of the game as they got the better of Wales on Friday . 'I remember getting interviewed two years ago and it was probably the lowest point of my coaching career, without a doubt,' said Lancaster. 'This win is definitely up there as the highest point because of all the pressure and emotion leading into it. We had a lot of challenges in getting new combinations together and I'm delighted to get the win. This cements our belief that we're going in the right direction.' The match did not pass by without drama. Both sides were involved in a tunnel stand-off before kick-off, with England skipper Chris Robshaw refusing to lead out his side until England emerged from the dressing room. 'We wanted to make sure we went out at the right time and weren't stood our there waiting for three or four minutes,' said Lancaster. 'I thought our back-row was exceptional. England's stars celebrate their brilliant win against Wales in the changing rooms . The atmosphere at the Millennium Stadium was electrifying both before and during the contest . Billy Vunipola, James Haskell and Chris Robshaw were excellent. For James Haskell, I think it was his best performance during my time as England coach and I think Billy Vunipola came of age. England were written off ahead of the match, having arrived in Cardiff with a double figure injury list including Courtney Lawes and Manu Tuilagi. That forced Lancaster to dip into his reserves of fringe players, with Haskell and Jonathan Joseph among those making claims for a regular starting berth. The result will cement England's belief for the rest of the tournament, while Wales are left in a dark place. Warren Gatland had a full strength squad at his disposal, yet his players choked under the expectation of a home victory. 'I don't look at it and say: 'are we concerned about England missing so many players?' said Gatland. 'It's top-level Test match rugby. They've got a number of injuries but they've got a huge amount of depth.'","England beat Wales 21-16 in the Six Nations opener on Friday night .

"CLICK HERE to read Chris Foy's full match report from the Millennium Stadium . Mike Catt cupped a hand to his ear, as the choruses of Swing Low rang around a rapidly emptying Millennium Stadium. Here was something you don’t see every day. An English lap of honour in Cardiff. Thoroughly deserved, too. If anything, the five-point winning margin flattered the hosts. England won the second half 13-0 and it could have been more. George Ford missed a kick; James Haskell ran into a post rather than over the line; a try by Dave Attwood was chalked off, debatably. Maybe, just maybe, 2015 will be a good year for the roses after all. The months before a World Cup need landmark wins, moments that define a group of players, and a coach. In 2003, Sir Clive Woodward’s team won back to back in New Zealand and Australia. Stuart Lancaster will be hoping this is his equivalent. The right win at the right time; a point proven, and a marker laid down. Mike Brown (centre) celebrates during England's impressive 21-16 victory over Wales in their opening Six Nations fixture .

Flames and fireworks accompany the light show as players make their way onto the the pitch in cardiff . Flames light up the Millennium Stadium as Wales players take to the field in front of a rapturous home crowd . Former England scrum-half Matt Dawson suggested that England would be though 'arrogant' if they had put on a similar pre-show . A spectacular light show before the game raised eyebrows with former England scrum-half Matt Dawson tweeting: ‘Imagine if England put on that show! #arrogantenglish?’ England captain Chris Robshaw made a point about not wanting his team to go out first but eventually had to. Ex-England skipper Will Carling tweeted: ‘I like that by Robshaw. A bit of attitude!’ Wales and Australia are England’s World Cup group opponents and Lancaster is now on a four-game winning streak against those teams. There has been a lot of pessimism around English prospects at their home World Cup but, slowly, it is evaporating. This was an injury-depleted side with Wales at close to full-strength. After eight minutes the score was Wales 10 England 0. It would have been easy to tumble towards the debacle of 2012’s record defeat here. Instead, England did not just rally, but dominated. They asked questions of Wales in the first half, and made definitive statements in the second. Joseph scored a quite outstanding try, dodging and squirming away from no less an opponent than George North to put down near to the posts. Only the boot of Leigh Halfpenny kept Wales’s noses in front for so long. There were fine performances from Joseph, Ford, Mike Brown, Haskell and Ben Youngs — among others — the pack were magnificent and Lancaster’s substitutions worked. Billy Twelvetrees took the energy level up a notch at a vital time, Tom Youngs was imposing. The reason moans about injuries are not tolerated from England is that Lancaster has the deepest talent pool this side of New Zealand. Wales could not have coped with losses at England’s level, but if anything Lancaster has a confusing number of options. Rhys Webb dives to score Wales' opening try as the Dragons raced to a 10-0 lead in the first half . Despite their victory, England still do not have a kicker to compare to the quality of Wales' superb Leigh Halfpenny . Wales players look dejected at the final whistle after being gradually reeled in by an England side increasing in confidence . Indeed, it is hard to say what this means for England, when such an important result is achieved with players missing. How can Lancaster resist Courtney Lawes or Brad Barritt once fit, for instance? Yet, equally, how can he turn his back on the players who came through for him here? How can Tom Wood replace Haskell after this? Lancaster has capped 66 players in his three years and events in Cardiff will only have added to selection conundrums rather than decided them, with so many names worthy of consideration. A coach will say these are nice problems, but a settled team is also to be envied. Woodward knew his by now, while it would be close to impossible to predict how many of last night’s starting XV will reprise those roles when these teams meet in the World Cup. Still, taking the positives — a dreadful refrain, but one that at last has some relevance — Lancaster’s England have shown they have strength in depth if misfortune strikes in the autumn. Short-term, there was euphoria. What could have been a sobering, even calamitous night given the perceived disparity between the teams instead may prove a turning point. The fear for English rugby was that this Six Nations competition could prove the worst possible preparation in World Cup year. With Wales and Ireland to play away and France the unknown quantity, the darkest speculation had England in fourth place and carrying that emotional baggage all the way to the World Cup. Not now. If England can win in Cardiff, they can give it a go in Dublin, too. And confidence will grow from here, no doubt of that. Ford is not a kicker of Halfpenny’s consistency, but the 45-metre arrow that clinched the game is one to put in the bank. No, he doesn’t inspire the faith that makes Halfpenny such a favourite son in these parts, but he has time. It was a triumph for Lancaster and his captain Chris Robshaw, too. Warren Gatland had deployed his usual repertoire of psychological tricks prior to the game — from creating a specious debate around the Millennium Stadium roof to having his coach Shaun Edwards accuse England of cheating with their running lines. Lancaster had been portrayed as his nice guy stooge. England fly-half George Ford's struck the post with a conversion but scored two penalty kicks to complete the victory .

Joseph dives over to prove that there is more strength in depth to Stuart Lancaster's squad than many thought . Joseph is mobbed by England team-mates after scoring a try to put England in command i the second half . Yet Lancaster won the battle of the roof, and Robshaw laid down the law in the tunnel. Refusing to be upstaged by Wales’s belated entrance, he took a little of the sting from the pre-match crescendo. Lancaster isn’t a greatly extrovert or boisterous figure, but his delight here could not be disguised. He was hugging his coaches at the end, a broad smile across his face. He was right about the roof, too. Gatland was moaning up until the minutes before the match in his TV interviews but rugby union isn’t badminton. It isn’t intended to be played in church halls or in benign, closed environments, shorn of variance and unpredictability. It is an outdoor game, exposed to the elements, and should remain that way wherever possible. If an open roof puts a match in jeopardy, through snow or torrential rain, that is different; but on a night like this one, cold and clear, with a little bit of breeze — that constitutes perfect rugby weather and should be left to do what it does. Hell, even had it been Ryder-Cup-at-Celtic-Manor torrential, handling that is part of the sport, too. So Cardiff saw a different side of England, at last — as far removed from the mauling of two years ago as could be considered possible. If all goes to plan, they will not need to visit Cardiff to win the World Cup later this year, but even if they did it would no longer be a trip filled with trepidation. To beat Wales 21-6 at the Millennium Stadium over a period of 72 minutes stands as one of the most impressive performances of Lancaster’s three years in charge, and it comes at the right time, in the right place — and against the right opponents, too.

"Jose Mourinho ended his self-imposed silence on Friday by immediately launching an attack on title rivals Manchester City for supposedly breaching financial fair play rules.

It's a reaction to Schurrle, a departure that is not a panic buy because he's a player we've known for a long, long time. 'I've coached in his league for two seasons. We are happy with our business. Schurrle is a player we like very, very much but the business was very good. We are happy with it.' Any regret with Schurrle? 'No. No. We are happy with what he gave us. We are happy with the investment we did on him, one and a half years ago. We are happy with the profit we made in this transfer window. Hopefully we made him a better player. Hopefully he can have success in the future because we like him very much.' You never seem to win at Villa Park... why is this? 'Because the opponents score more goals than us, or sometimes the same number of goals.' They're the team with the least goals, you're the team with the most... hot favourites? 'I don't have to speak about Aston Villa.' What did you learn from that defeat last year? 'I learned nothing that I hadn't learned before that. There are matches that are impossible to win and you have to be smart enough to understand that. Afer so many years in football, there are matches that I clearly know it's impossible to win.' How many sides are there in the title race? 'That's not my problem. We are one side. It's up to the others to wonder whether they are title contenders or not. We consider we are, even if sometimes it's more difficult that it might be. But we consider ourselves contenders.' Team news? 'Filipe [Luis] is injured. The player [Diego Costa] is suspended.' Fabregas? 'I told you. Filipe is injured and the player who is suspended is suspended. Everybody (else) is fit.' Where will Cuadrado play in your team? 'Goalkeeper impossible because we don't need him there. Central defenders we don't need, and he's too small. After that he can play everywhere.' Is he ready now? 'I think he can, unless the Premier League or FA say some rule stops him.' Can Mohammed Salah come back? 'He's a Chelsea player who is on loan. He's our player. When we sell the players, they're not ours. But he is our player.' Are you proud of the business you've done in the last few windows? 'That's not my job at the club. You have to give credit to the people in the club who deal with numbers. They deserve credit for that.' Does that game at Villa Park still rankle with you? 'I don't speak about it. I don't have to speak about it.' Drogba or Remy tomorrow? 'Yes. One (of them).' Five points clear, Capital One Cup final, Champions League last 16, you should be enjoying it. You don't appear to be? Is that fair? 'I'm enjoying my work with my players. When I like my players, when I like my squad, I'm much more happy, more motivated to work, and this is the case.' It's just when you speak to us? 'Speak to you? You know why I'm here, so you cannot expect that I'm super happy to be here.' So you're here because you have to be here? 'Yes.' Could Cuadrado start? Or does he need a bit longer to settle down? 'I'm going to repeat the words I said three weeks ago, so many now people can understand. I said, he fits into the Fiorentina and Colombia's team. At this moment, he fits in Colombia and Chelsea teams.' Is he at the right physical level? 'He trained just two days. I cannot say much. The business situation almost to the last minute on Monday, he had to go to Paris for visas and the legal situation on the Tuesday. He only trained here a couple of days. I cannot say much.' Why didn't you speak to the media before City? 'Because, if you want, you can make a silence very noisy. It depends what you want to do. You could. You could. You could make noise with my silence, because you know the reason for my silence. It depends on you. If I was a journalist, from silence I could make lots of words.' All because of Costa's ban? 'Not just (that).' How do you reflect on that suspension? 'I don't reflect, because maybe I'll be punished if I reflect. Maybe they can read my reflection, and I don't want that.' Any word on Kurt Zouma's progression? 'Good. Very good.' Do you expect more from him still? 'A kid of 20, I expect always to improve.' Are you pleased with your position? 'I feel the distance could be much bigger. If I analysed – which I'm not going to do – the last five, six, seven matches, we could, we should have a bigger difference.' Why no new deal announced with Hazard? 'Why should it be officialised? Why? What's the problem? He has a contract with Chelsea for two or three more years. Are you worried? I'm not worried. I'm not worried.' Varane at 18, now Zouma at 20 with Chelsea... are you impressed by both players, the future of the French team? 'I think the French federation should write me a letter to thank me because I think they have now the two best young defenders in the world. Not the two 'best', because they are young. There are final products, mature players of 25, 28, 30 years of age. But as young defenders, can you imagine what Zouma and Varane could represent in a couple of years? Didier [Deschamps] should be very happy with that. For sure.' Do you expect to be fined by the Premier League for not attending the media conferences? 'You know, the only surprise I had in relation for that was not to be punished when I was pushed by another manager. Apart from that, I can expect everything.' Are you thinking about PSG? 'No. Three matches to play before that. I don't have time. I have to prepare Aston Villa, Everton and, after that, yes. After Everton I will prepare for PSG.' How did University affect your life? 'Every experience you have in life helps you to be what you are. University was five years of my life. For sure, it made a contribution to what I am. I cannot measure it. I can't say it's more important than being a manager's son, or more important than being an assistant to other managers. I don't know.'","The Chelsea boss seemed frosty as he reluctantly answered questions .

"Keiron Cunningham tasted success in his first game as St Helens coach in a stop-start match against Catalans Dragons that saw former Australia centre Willie Tonga knocked out just 12 seconds into his Super League debut. Former London Broncos forward Atelea Vea marked his Saints debut with the game's first try and 19-year-old Andre Savelio scored his first try for the club as the defending champions ground out an 18-7 victory against their injury-stricken opponents. Catalans centre Willie Tonga knocked out just 12 seconds into his Super League debut . Tonga, one of the Catalans Dragons' major close-season signings, was hurt in the very first tackle of the match at Langtree Park as he attempted to bring down Saints towering prop Alex Walmsley without ever getting into a position to make the tackle. The game was held up for eight minutes before Tonga was carried off on a stretcher and, although he was later reported to be ""fine"", he will have little recollection of his first taste of Super League action. Already without first-choice half-backs Todd Carney, who withdrew on the day of the game after failing to shake off a calf strain, and Scott Dureau, it got even worse for the visitors when Thomas Bosc left the field for treatment after just four minutes, although he was able to return soon afterwards. Second rower Zeb Taia, who switched with great effect to Tonga's centre spot, had an early try ruled out by video referee Ben Thaler for an obstruction and Saints immediately opened the scoring when Vea took a short pass from fellow debutant Travis Burns and proved unstoppable from five metres out. Zeb Taia of Catalans Dragons looses his footing in a tackle at Langtree Park on Friday night . Tom Makinson's goal made it 6-0 and centre Mark Percival looked certain to increase the lead when quick hands from Burns and Jonny Lomax got him into space, only for the refreshed Bosc to somehow dislodge the ball from his grasp. The tide began to turn as the Dragons re-grouped and built pressure on the back of three goal-line drop-outs. The Frenchmen were also aided by a run of five consecutive penalties, which stretched the patience of referee Phil Bentham, who sent Saints forward Greg Richards to the sin-bin on 35 minutes just moments after issuing a final team warning. The Dragons instantly took advantage of the extra man, with hooker Eloi Pelissier catching the Saints defence napping with a quickly-taken tap penalty. Atelea Vea goes over for the opening try for St Helens against Catalans Dragons . Bosc kicked the conversion to tie the scores and edged his side into an unlikely 7-6 interval lead with a drop goal. Saints new captain Jon Wilkin was seen apparently remonstrating with Bentham before storming down the tunnel but the official began to endear himself to the 12,000 home fans by awarding the first three penalties of the second half to Saints, one of them for a shoulder charge by full-back Morgan Escare as he bundled Makinson into touch just short of the line. The pressure told when centre Jordan Turner took Lomax's pass to force his way over for St Helens' second try three minutes into the second half with his side still down to 12 men. Kyle Amor of St Helens crashes into Remy Casty and Gregory Mounis of Catalans Dragons . Pelissier had a second try ruled out for a knock-on and Saints made sure of an opening-round win when Savelio forced his way over from close range for their third try on 57 minutes. The Catalans were down to 12 men by then with winger Michael Oldfield despatched to the sin-bin for a professional foul, holding down Lomax after he had broken clear and looked a likely scorer, and Makinson went over for a fourth try five minutes from the end. A last-minute skirmish quickly petered out but three yellow cards and one red after just two matches represents a stormy start to the first round of Super League XX.","New signing Willie Tonga was hurt in the very first tackle of the match .

"Beyond the fridge full of Spanish ham in his office, the enduring memory of an hour or so in the company of Roberto Martinez this time last year was the clarity of his thought and the freshness of his ideas. Even when it came to his diet, he appeared to have a unique recipe for success. He would eat carbohydrates in the evening to fuel the brain because he liked to do much of his thinking at night. But he would eat nothing immediately before a game because he wanted the blood in his brain rather than in his stomach when providing direction from the technical area. It was an interview from which you emerged feeling educated. You could see, 22 Premier League games into his tenure at Everton, why his side were reflecting on just two defeats. His attention to detail, even in this era of a more scientific approach to sport, was impressive. Roberto Martinez's Everton side have fallen from Champions League contenders to the bottom half . Staff at the club’s Finch Farm training ground appeared to be in awe of their Catalan leader. Understandably, they had been unsettled by the departure of David Moyes but Martinez had made the transition easier than they had perhaps feared, employing charm, charisma and drive to get everyone, from the star players to the secretaries, buying into his regime. Today, the majority of players at Everton continue to like Martinez’s style as manager. One senior dressing room source described him this week as a ‘courageous, tactically astute coach’ who encourages them to fear no-one. They have found his approach to the bigger games particularly refreshing. Martinez sends them out to play with ambition rather than inhibition. But something has changed for the worse in Martinez’s second season in charge, as nine defeats in their first 22 games demonstrated prior to a much-needed victory at Crystal Palace last weekend. A 3-0 defeat at Southampton was one of four in a row over Christmas and nine in the league this season . Leighton Baines and Kevin Mirallas had a penalty row during Everton's draw against West Brom . The Belgian Mirallas decided to relieve Baines of his penalty-taking duties, but missed the spot-kick . Martinez's side lie 12th in the Premier League . ‘There is a danger they are turning into his Wigan team,’ said another qualified observer, and while that might seem harsh, the 34 league goals they have so far conceded amounts to the joint-fifth worst defensive record in the top flight. This week Martinez shared his thoughts on why, pointing to the additional burden of European football and the number of injuries. ‘Remember we had a player in Leon Osman last season who played in every game,’ he said before also pointing to the absence of Steven Pienaar and James McCarthy, among others. Some point to a deeper problem, however: to the impact the departure of certain staff has had on dressing room, and club, morale. In that same interview last year, Martinez said ‘he wanted to change things without losing anything’ in recognition of the club Moyes had so successfully created. But some changes have been regarded by some as heavy losses. Danny Donachie resigned as head of medicine in December, while conditioning coach Steve Tashjian left in the summer and another fitness coach, Dave Billows, before that. There is nothing new in a manager bringing in his own staff but these three particular members of the backroom staff were regarded by many as the oil in the machine. ‘They were very popular with the players, and trusted,’ said one dressing room source. ‘They would keep the ship sailing.’ A physiotherapist who had been at Goodison Park for more than a decade, Donachie is the son of former assistant manager Willie and regarded as something of an innovator when it comes to the management of injuries. But it seems he may have clashed with Martinez, himself a qualified physiotherapist, over the treatment of injuries, which may have led to his departure. Donachie alluded to as much in an interview he gave to a professional publication last season. The Everton manager has seen some of the club's key staff leave over the last year . Martinez's Everton side take on Liverpool in the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park on Saturday . ‘It’s not inconceivable to find yourself in a position where the athlete and the coaching staff are desperate to play in the next game and you know it’s not in their best interest,’ said Donachie. ‘This is when your communication skills come into play, by convincing the management it is the best thing for the player and hence the team and explain and cajole the player into preparing for the more sensible option.’ Donachie is currently on gardening leave but is sure to be in demand. Much has been made of Everton’s injury record since Martinez took charge, in particular the 18 hamstring injuries in his first 18 months in charge. Sportsmail examined the club’s injury record in more detail and can report that in Martinez’s 20 months in charge there have been 105 injuries, 85 of them to key players. Compare that to the last 20 months of Moyes’s tenure: 93 injuries with 60 to key players. Not a huge difference, but a rise all the same. One reason being given is ‘too much ball work’ which probably demands medical expertise to explain but appears to suggest Martinez believes in certain training methods that place the body under more stress than it is used to. Samuel Eto'o joined Everton in the summer, but left for Sampdoria in January after a very short spell . There are other issues that often arise when a team is not getting results: claims of unhappy senior players and personality clashes. Samuel Eto’o, who was at the club for only the briefest of spells, is understood to have been a central figure in training ground disputes. Concerns have been raised over the players’ fitness. Once a strength of Everton teams driven hard by Moyes, there have been times this season when the same players have looked sluggish and heavy-legged. Some blame it on a softening of the spirit, on Martinez’s failure to take the appropriate action when there has been a dip in standards. Martinez always seems keen to see the positive in everything. Only this week he insisted he saw ‘a focused face’ in that rather amusing photograph of Aaron Lennon when everyone else saw a player seemingly unhappy to be on loan in the north west of England. Aaron Lennon joined Everton on loan from Tottenham until the end of the season . Lennon gave a stern expression in his official photos after signing for Everton on loan . It is said to frustrate some players that Martinez is too soft when the misfiring team is crying out for the tough discipline his predecessor used to administer. ‘The team had a fighting spirit that seems to have disappeared,’ said one insider. And yet here’s the thing. Players supposedly wanting Martinez to get tough were then heard to complain about a training trip to Qatar last week. It was all work and no play. Double sessions. No real down time. ‘Boring,’ was one verdict, even if it was followed by that win at Selhurst Park. The players were said to be less offended than they perhaps should have been when Kevin Mirallas decided to relieve Leighton Baines of the penalty-taking duties against West Brom last month, only to miss. But it was also noted that Martinez did not confront Mirallas at half-time, mainly because the Belgian forward never appeared in the dressing room having instead dived into the treatment room and declared himself unfit to play the second half. Romelu Lukaku's goal at Selhurst Park earned Everton a much-needed first victory in seven games . Given the opportunity to respond this week, Martinez rejected the idea that changes in the backroom staff were to blame for what has been a disappointing campaign, one that he hopes will finally take off against Liverpool on Saturday. ‘No, no, not at all, no,’ he said in response to a question about Donachie and his colleagues. ‘It has been more in the playing staff if anything. I don’t think the staff changes have affected us. ‘Danny (Donachie) had a terrific time with Everton and when you make your own decision you’re not pushed away. When you make your own decision it is probably the best for everyone as it means you are not enjoying what you do. I don’t think it has had an effect on the team at all, not on the performance of the team.’ David Moyes was renowned for his tough discipline during his time as Everton manager . And he might be right. It might be a wider issue. It might be a broad spectrum of issues that a manager encounters when he succeeds a long-serving, successful manager, in particular once he starts making changes to a professional environment that the players had grown used to. It might be that Martinez is now enduring the sort of difficulties Moyes encountered at Manchester United, and which Louis van Gaal is encountering now. It might be that not until Everton have emerged from transition, and Martinez has things exactly how he wants them, will they perform with the consistency they achieved under Moyes. When Martinez moved into Finch Farm he had a wall on one staircase decorated with photographs of the club’s glory days, leaving a blank space for what he hoped would be the second FA Cup triumph of his career. Now it seems likely to remain blank for a while, however clear an idea Martinez might have of what happens next.","Roberto Martinez is seen as a soft touch by the players .

"James Haskell celebrated his return to the England fold with a typical all-action display in their 21-16 win over Wales, but he ended up red-faced after running into the post instead of diving over for a certain try. The Wasps skipper has been in and out of the England side for years now, but with injuries piling up in the back row he was given the nod and certainly put his hand up to become a mainstay with a powerful performance at the Millennium Stadium. But England were 16-15 down and putting Wales under intense pressure when Haskell ran straight into the post in a slapstick moment amid the fury of battle in the RBS 6 Nations opener. James Haskell (centre) was denied a try during England's 21-16 victory over Wales on Friday night . Haskell (with the blue scrum cap) is tackled by Wales' Toby Faletau into the post protector in Cardiff . Haskell (blue scrum cap) bounced back off the post protector at the Millennium Stadium on Friday . 'I knew I wasn't going to get there so I tried to hit and bounce back out and I bounced back into the post unbelievably, but only I could do that,' he told BBC Sport. In the end it did not matter as fly-half George Ford booted England clear with two late penalties and that was a remarkable turnaround after Wales raced into a 10-0 lead after eight minutes. With the Cardiff crowd still dazzled by a fireworks and lights show beforehand, Warren Gatland's men caught England cold as Rhys Webb scampered over and Leigh Halfpenny added the extras and a penalty. But England built on some mighty work by their forwards as Bath backs and Six Nations debutants Anthony Watson and Jonathan Joseph both claimed touchdowns. Ford added three penalties and a conversion - his second strike after Wales wing Alex Cuthbert had been sin-binned - while Wales failed to score in the second period after another Halfpenny penalty and a Dan Biggar drop-goal had given them what appeared to be a solid advantage. Faletau (right) pushes Haskell into the post as he is prevented from scoring a try for England . Haskell (centre) is tackled by Wales' Alex Cuthbert (left) as he advances with the ball for England . Haskell said afterwards that Stuart Lancaster's men always believed they were capable of turning things round, adding: 'We've done a lot of work, there's a lot of talent in this group, and I think we felt if we stick in the game, keep our discipline and play in the right areas then we were going to get tries.' Ford once again showcased his talents, remaining cool under pressure to boot over the decisive penalty after England had given themselves an 18-16 lead, and he was just glad to give his side their just rewards for a stellar evening's work. 'I just wanted to knock it over for the lads really. The performance they put in, especially the pack again, was outstanding so it was the least I could do to kick that,' he said. 'We felt comfortable first half. We obviously had a bit of a poor start but to come out and score 13 points, the message at half-time was exactly the same as the messages before the game.' Faletau (obscured) tackles Haskell during England's famous victory at the Millennium Stadium . Wales boss Gatland paid tribute to England's second-half show, despite clear frustrations over his side throwing away the 16-8 advantage they held at half-time. 'Give England credit, I thought they played particularly well in the second half,' he said. 'I thought we started the game well and played pretty well in the first half, were reasonably comfortable at half-time, but we weren't able to score points in the second half and that sometimes happens at top-level sport.' There was a question mark afterwards over George North being allowed to play the whole game, despite picking up several heavy knocks, and some were questioning if he was showing signs of concussion. Gatland belayed those fears and backed his medical team, adding: 'Well that's part of the medical protocol. The medical team wouldn't have let him back on the field unless they felt 100 per cent confident that he was okay, so you've got to back your medical team and I haven't spoken to them about it. George seems fine.' Haskell (second right) celebrates with England team-mate Billy Vunipola (left) at the final whistle .","England beat Wales 21-16 at the Millennium Stadium on Friday night .
