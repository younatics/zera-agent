"Any moment now there will surely be a press release issued by the Tiger Woods camp in which the man himself reveals an online account was hacked and words purporting to come from him were actually a spoof. That can be the only rational response to an extraordinary over-reaction from Woods to a low-grade piece of parody in the latest issue of Golf Digest. In his take on an ‘interview’ in the magazine that makes clear in the headline it is fake and therefore satirical, Woods actually manages to come across as more deranged than the one parodied. Tiger Woods (right) took exception to a parody of the golf star in the latest issue of Golf Digest magazine . The article in question was penned by revered American golf writer Dan Jenkins . Talk about truth being stranger than fiction. In a blog on a website called The Players’ Tribune, Woods labels the piece a ‘grudge-fuelled piece of character assassination’ and follows it with an amazing statement: ‘Journalistically and ethically, can you sink any lower?’ Talk about losing the plot completely. Woods hits a shot on the 12th hole during the second round 96th at the PGA Championship in August . Let us emphasise the piece is wholly unfunny, drawing upon tired cliches about Woods — that he has no mates, does not like tipping — and mocks his scandal-ridden past ad nauseam. But not being very good is the worst charge you can make, given the lengths which the headline goes to stress the interview is not genuine. Ethically, it steps into no grey area whatsoever. Trouble is, it was written by Dan Jenkins, the most celebrated golf writer in America. Jenkins is 84 and has been to more than 220 major championships. He once failed to name Woods in his all-time top five, which might be why, in Tiger’s world, he suspects a ‘grudge’. But most people would consider it an opinion to which Jenkins is more than entitled. Woods  hits his tee shot on the 11th hole during the second round of the tournament in Valhalla . Golf Digest reacted the only way a proper magazine could to cries from the Woods camp for an apology. They promoted it to become the lead article on their website. This could now become the most read piece Jenkins has written for several decades — a shame, given the many brilliant ones he has penned. The vast majority of people, I predict, will get about halfway through and wonder what possessed Woods to react in the way he did. Or maybe that press release saying his account was hacked is still winging its way through the ether. Meanwhile, it is back down to Earth — the name of the course that will host the European Tour’s season finale, the DP World Tour Championship, starting on Thursday. The Race to Dubai might be run, but with the tour’s finest all in attendance, there’s no reason why the greatest season in the history of European golf should not get an appropriate send-off. For a start there are so many among the cast of 60 for whom a win in this event would change the entire complexion of their season. Ian Poulter plays a shot in the practice round ahead of the forthcoming DP World Tour Championship . Take Ian Poulter. Right now, he is looking at 2014 the way somebody does a bit of dog poo on the sole of their shoe. But a victory here and he would finish second behind the Race to Dubai winner Rory McIlroy with a seven-figure cheque in his pocket. It could happen, too. All those months of pent-up frustration have suddenly been eased by a couple of good tournaments in a row. Who knows what might happen following his conversation with the Australian legend Greg Norman on Tuesday night, about putting technique. Poulter should have won the Turkish Airlines Open last week, given he led by six shots at one stage. He even missed from 6ft on the final green to force a play-off. Poulter recently met with Australian legend Greg Norman, pictured with his wife Kirsten Kutner . Watching at home, Norman believed he knew why and tweeted as much. Naturally, Poulter followed that up with a phone call and spent much of yesterday on the practice putting green trying to work out if Norman was right. ‘It was really nice of Greg to reach out but I’ve been working hard on my putting and I feel like I’ve made good inroads,’ said Poulter. ‘Obviously a couple of key putts have slipped past but I’d like to review them myself as well as having a great opinion from Greg. So I will let you know what conclusion I reached on Sunday night. How about that?’ Poulter has a good record here, having lost a play-off in 2010 to Robert Karlsson, while he was pipped by another Swede, Henrik Stenson, last year. The man they will all have to beat, of course, is the one Stenson will accompany on the first tee just after High Noon here today. As Tiger descends beyond parody, we should be ever more thankful for the contrasting example set by his successor as the world’s best player, McIlroy.","Tiger Woods labels parody piece as a ‘grudge-fuelled piece of character assassination’

"American John Hahn produced the round of his life to shoot an incredible 58 in the fourth round of the European Tour's qualifying school in Spain. However, the 25-year-old will not be able to claim an official record as preferred lies were in place on the par-70 Tour Course at the PGA Catalunya Resort in Girona. Hahn recorded 12 birdies, which was perfectly timed as he leapt from six shots outside the cut mark to inside the top 15 with two days remaining. John Hahn poses with the ball he used to shoot his remarkable score of 58 on Tuesday . Hahn's stunning scorecard included 12 birdies over the famous course at PGA Catalunya . The American is no stranger to outrageous scoring this season, having carded an eventful 65 in the final round of the Italian Open, where he began eagle-birdie-birdie-birdie on his way to an outward 28, but despite getting to nine under through 10 holes he had a quadruple-bogey seven on the short 13th to derail any chance of a sub-60 round. There have been lower scores than Hahn's at European Tour events but they too did not qualify for an official record. Scotland's Scott Jamieson and South Africa Jaco van Zyl both carded a 57 at the 2013 Nelson Mandela Championship on a dramatically shortened course reduced to a par 65 after heavy rainfall affected the Royal Durban Golf Club.

"Scotland's Richie Ramsay made a flying start to set the early pace in the first round of the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai on Thursday. Ramsay took advantage of ideal conditions to birdie the first three holes on the Earth Course at Jumeirah Golf Estates, moving to three under par and into a one-shot lead over South African Thomas Aiken and England's Tyrrell Hatton. English trio Ross Fisher, David Howell and Oliver Wilson were a shot further back, with Wilson recovering from a bogey at the first with birdies from eight and three feet at the third and fifth respectively.

McIlroy has not played since finishing second to Wilson in the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship in the first week of October, the 25-year-old withdrawing from scheduled appearances in the first two Final Series events in China to prepare for his upcoming court case with a former management company. So it was perhaps no surprise that the four-time major winner had posted on Twitter: 'Just under 3 hours until I hit my first competitive golf shot in 6 weeks.

"They've all hit memorable shots at the climax to the Race to Dubai, but could any of them match - or even better - each other in a unique challenge on the Earth Course? That was the task for Rory McIlroy, Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson earlier this week when the trio warmed-up for the DP World Tour Championship by trying to recreate each other's famous shots on the 18th hole at the tournament. Stenson's effort - a stunning three wood approach to the green which won the European Tour's Shot of the Year award in 2013 - was first up for McIlroy and Rose.

McIlroy, who has already sealed victory in this year's Race to Dubai, came out on top though, with his attempt rolling to within a few feet of the pin. Next up was Rose's ridiculous putt from 2012, which seemed to take an eternity to trickle down one tier and end up agonisingly close to dropping straight in. Neither Stenson or world No 1 McIlroy could read it as well as the Englishman, who finished second two years ago, with both of their efforts finishing left and beyond the hole.

"Former European number one Henrik Stenson wants to rediscover the formula which saw him create history last year by successfully defending a tournament for the first time in his career. Stenson's last victory of a phenomenal 2013 came in the DP World Tour Championship and ensured he became the first man to win the FedEx Cup on the PGA Tour and the European Tour's Race to Dubai in the same year. Unsurprisingly the 38-year-old has been unable to reproduce such success this season, although he returns to Jumeirah Golf Estates in Dubai in second place on the money list behind world number one Rory McIlroy, whose four wins - including two majors - helped him wrap up the Race to Dubai title with a week to spare. Henrik Stenson won the FedEx Cup, PGA Tour and European Tour's Race to Dubai in 2013 . 'Last year was very special and I know it can't be as special this year because Rory has already won the overall race,' said Stenson, who was 25 under par in beating Ian Poulter by six shots here 12 months ago. 'But I can make it a very special week for myself by playing well here and hopefully give myself a chance to win. I haven't defended a title as of yet, so I couldn't think of a much better place to do it than here this week. 'I'm pretty pleased with the overall performance this year. It was always going to be a tough one and, especially early in the season, it was tough. I was battling a bit of fatigue and when you're tired you don't have the energy to practise and get going with the game and then it just becomes a bit of a bad cycle. Unsurprisingly, the 38-year-old Swede has struggled to replicate the same remarkable form in 2014 . 'From late spring onwards it's been quite all right and I contended in a few events and had a couple of strong results. Overall it's not a bad season by any means. I think I got close to 200 world ranking points on the board, which is always a good indicator for a strong season. It's a win that's missing and hopefully I can take the opportunity here.' Stenson was third in the Turkish Airlines Open on Sunday, his 26th event of a season which will end with the Hero World Challenge - hosted by Tiger Woods - from December 4-7. 'I'm excited about next year's schedule,' added the world number four, who won three points from four matches in Europe's Ryder Cup victory at Gleneagles in September. 'I kind of had a great formula from 2012 and into 2013, and then I felt like I slipped out of that one a little bit due to a lot of different reasons. 'I'm excited about trying to get back into that, because it was a pretty good recipe I had. I want to get back to doing all the little bits and pieces right and focus on all those processes, rather than trying to find your game and work on your game when you're out here. I'll do that away from the tournaments. When I'm out here, I'm here to be fresh and be ready to compete. 'I played 31 tournaments in 2013, 28 this year and would like to get down to 26.'

"Rory McIlroy could hardly contain his enthusiasm in the build-up to the first round of the DP World Tour Championship on Thursday – and it showed as he made a blistering start. The world No 1 had taken to social media to express his feelings. 'Just under 3 hours until I hit my first competitive golf shot in 6 weeks. To say I’m excited is an understatement,' he tweeted, complete with the hashtag: imready. Out on the course, the world No 1 looked more than ready, as he went round in a fabulous 66 to be tied for the lead with Irishman Shane Lowry and lower still further his staggering stroke average on an Earth course that most players consider rather difficult. VIDEO Scroll down to watch DP World Tour Championship day 1 highlights . Rory McIlroy has made a brilliant start to the DP World Tour Championship . In 21 rounds here, McIlroy is now a scarcely believable 80 under par, and he has never shot worse than the regulation figure of 72 – and there’s only been one of those. As for the other 20 rounds he has had: six 66s, five 67s, two 68s, two 69s and five 71s. His start in particular on Thursday was mesmerising. You might have thought there would be a touch of early rust after an extended period of inactivity but not a bit of it. One brilliant shot followed another and he stood on the sixth tee at four under par. Not just the Race to Dubai, but this tournament looked as if it was going to be all over bar the shouting long before the 72nd hole as well. Not getting the fairly routine birdie four at the long 7th stopped the momentum, as a string of prosaic pars followed. Indeed, McIlroy had to show off a touch of magic around the green at the difficult par four 12th to prevent registering his first dropped shot. McIlroy finished the first day tied for the lead with Irishman Shane Lowry on 66 . The crowd look on as the Northern Irishman takes his second short on the 12th hole . The 25-year-old returned to the birdie trail by rolling in a nice 12ft putt at the 15th before notching his sixth gain with a similar length putt at the next hole. Lowry is currently 52nd in the world and needs to break into the top 50 by the end of this event to secure a first appearance at the Masters. He has been on the cusp of making it for the last month but blew a great chance with a poor final round at the Turkish Airlines Open last week. ‘It has been on my mind for a while,’ he admitted. Lowry made his score with a wonderful finish that saw him birdie four of the last six holes. The pair finished one stroke ahead of exciting Dane Thobjorn Olesen and Scot Richie Ramsay, while in-form Henrik Stenson, playing alongside McIlroy, shot a fine 68.

Ian Poulter’s conversation about putting with Australian Greg Norman on Tuesday night produced no immediate dividend as he stumbled to a poor 75 – and his hopes of finishing the season with a first victory in two years are almost certainly over.

"Tiger Woods has lashed out at Golf Digest for a  'below-the-belt' fake interview with him, calling the article a 'grudge-fuelled piece of character assassination'. Woods, who is recovering from a back problem that has repeatedly hampered his progress this season, lists himself in each place when asked to name his top five golfers of all time in the parody interview. The 14-time major winner has written a blog post in response, revealing his anger at having to 'publicly deny he mistreats his friends and takes pleasure in firing people'. Tiger Woods was not left amused by Golf Digest's fake interview with him . Woods has not played competitive golf since the second round of the PGA Championship in August and has written an angry blog post about the non-interview, which was trailed on the cover (above) Woods in action during the second round of the PGA Championship in August . The article - entitled My (Fake) Interview With Tiger*, with the subtitle '(Or how it plays out in my mind) was written by respected golf journalist Dan Jenkins for the magazine's December 2014 issue. It includes segments where the fake voice of Woods waxes lyrical about his love of firing everybody close to him, and seems to have no idea who his longtime friend and ally Mark O'Meara even is. The comedy persona also takes on Woods's reputation for being a lousy tipper, and suggests waiters should 'get a better job'. Towards the end of the interview, pseudo-Woods also takes the unusual step of naming himself as all five entries in a list of the best golfers of all time. The character said: 'I rank me at Pebble Beach in 2000 first, me in the '97 Masters second, me at St Andrews in 2000 third, me at Hoylake in 2006 fourth, and me at Bay Hill, Firestone, Memorial and Torrey fifth ... pick a year.'

Woods won the British Open at St. Andrews in 2000 which the Golf Digest mock interview also mentioned .

'Because it wasn’t me. It was some jerk he created to pretend he was talking to me.' He continued: 'All athletes know that we will be under scrutiny from the media. But this concocted article was below the belt. 'Good-natured satire is one thing, but no fair-minded writer would put someone in the position of having to publicly deny that he mistreats his friends, takes pleasure in firing people, and stiffs on tips - and a lot of other slurs, too.' Woods added that he and his agent have written to Golf Digest demanding an explanation - though editors of the magazine have already responded by reiterating that their article is a clearly-marked parody.","Tiger Woods lashed out at article in latest issue of  magazine .

"It is estimated that one in five accidents on motorways are caused by people falling asleep at the wheel. But a new watch that vibrates to stop divers nodding off on long journeys – and people falling asleep during tedious meetings – could help to keep you alert and safer. The device, which is yet to be launched, looks like a normal wrist watch but features sensors that can tell if the wearer is awake. Scroll down for video . Wakey wakey! The Spark Watch (pictured) which has yet to be launched, looks like a normal wrist watch but features sensors that can tell if the wearer is awake . Spark will use two motion sensors to keep track of a wearer’s movement patterns throughout the day. Based on their unique patterns, the gadget will be able to detect when they are in the process of dozing off. If Spark detects that a person has fallen asleep, it will vibrate to wake them back up. Users will be able to adjust the intensity of the vibration to suit their own preferences. If wearers want to keep wearing the device over night, they can put the watch in ‘Time Mode’ to turn off the sensors. There is also a button to tell the time. If someone wearing the Spark Watch starts to nod off, the built-in motion detectors will activate a vibrating motor, which will start buzzing. The watch contains two motion sensors that detect movement velocity and frequency. The data collected is processed by a unique algorithm to judge the wearer’s conscious state. While the vibration generated when a wearer nods off is painless, it is persistent and will continue until the wearer of the watch is awake. The gadget runs on a lithium-ion battery and lasts between five to seven days on a single charge. It has a micro USB port for charging when needed. No more naps: If someone wearing the Spark Watch starts to nod off, the built-in motion detectors will activate a vibrating motor, which will start buzzing. It is designed to keep people alert on long car journeys (pictured) when accidents can occur from drivers nodding off, and during boring business meetings . As well as potentially preventing road accidents, the inventors of the watch suggest that it could be worn by students to stop them falling asleep during long revision sessions or by people trying to stay awake during boring business meetings. Writing on crowd funding website Kickstarter, where the gadget can be ordered, the inventors said: ‘We created Spark to help you overcome fatigue and drowsiness so that you can be as efficient and focused as possible. Eddy Zhong, 17, from Cambridge, Massachusetts, said: ‘Spark is a watch that keeps you awake by nudging you when you nod off. ‘The watch keeps track of your movement patterns and uses a unique algorithm to detect your conscious state. Always alert: The watch contains two motion sensors that detect movement velocity and frequency. The data collected is processed by a unique algorithm to judge the wearer's conscious state. If it suspects the wearer has fallen asleep, the watch vibrates . ‘Embedded are two custom motion sensors that keep track of movement velocity and movement frequency, respectively. If you doze off, it gently vibrates until you wake back up. ‘The watch keeps people awake during class, at work, or anything else important. You can't always have a cup of coffee, but you can always wear a watch.’ The invention has been launched on Kickstarter, where so far over $21,000 (£12,000) has been raised to put it into production, far exceeding its inventors’ $6,000 (£3,500) goal. It is available to pre-order for $49 (£29 plus shipping) with an estimated shipping date of November.

"Pitchforks at the ready! Behind the perfectly pruned hedgerows of Britain's gardening community people are whispering. And the hot topic is what will happen at this week's Chelsea Flower Show when the BBC's new presenter at Britain's most prestigious horticultural event bumps into his predecessor Alan Titchmarsh, who's exhibiting there for the first time in three decades. Alan, who until last year had hosted the event for almost 30 years, announced he was walking out six months ago because the BBC was talking to another presenter about hosting its coverage of Chelsea - two daily programmes, one on BBC1 and one on BBC2, during the five-day show - which he claimed was his 'chosen profession and area of expertise'. Monty Don ruffled a few feathers when it was revealed that he would be presenting this year's Chelsea Flower Show instead of Alan Titchmarsh . It turns out he was talking about Weekend's own gardening expert, Monty Don. Awkward. While Monty's appointment has pleased the millions of fans who adore his many gardening shows and columns in this magazine, there's a section of the horticultural community who aren't happy. They still regard him as an amateur despite his decades in the business. Alan, who's an ambassador for the Royal Horticultural Society and has certificates from the Hertfordshire College of Agriculture and Horticulture and Kew Gardens, is one of them. Monty, who has no qualifications in gardening, is one of us. Fortunately Monty, 58, has had enough brickbats thrown at him in his long career to be able to laugh them off. 'If people want to be snotty about me, that's their problem, not mine,' he shrugs. 'I'd love to say to them, ""Just get a life!"" If they don't accept me now, after all these years I've been gardening, well...' he tails off. 'I always say come and look at my garden. Is it beautiful? Yes. Does it give pleasure? Yes. There are a few people in the horticultural world who have this rigidity; they say there's only one way to do something and if you don't do it that way you're wrong. But for me the end is to have a beautiful garden and it doesn't matter how you get there. I don't make shows for professional gardeners; I make them for amateurs because I am one.' Monty will be presenting alongside  Sophie Raworth . Monty's been reporting on and writing about Chelsea for nearly 30 years. He hosted the show when Channel 4 had rights to the coverage for a few years in the late 90s. So he wasn't overly surprised when the BBC approached him about taking over shortly after last year's extravaganza finished, even if it has put certain noses out of joint. 'It was the BBC's decision to approach me,' says Monty. He also insists he's a huge fan of Alan's, even though they barely know each other despite their parallel careers. (Monty also took over Gardeners' World from Alan ten years ago.) 'I've only met him two or three times and he seems a very pleasant chap,' he says. 'You'll never find anyone who's worked with him to have a bad word to say about him. He seems a decent and hard-working man and I admire him. I know we're pitched as rivals but the way I see it there is room for the both of us.' Matter closed. Monty's just happy to be hosting the event, along with a true gardening novice, BBC newsreader Sophie Raworth. 'There's nothing like Chelsea anywhere else in the world,' he says, adding that the flower show does the two things it needs to do well brilliantly. 'For the industry, it's a benchmark, it's the gold standard that everything else is measured by. If you're a gold medallist at Chelsea you're the best. While for the public it's part of the British social calendar like Wimbledon and Ascot. 'The British are very good at this mixture of ceremony and love of the countryside, and it all comes together at Chelsea. Some American gardening friends who were here one year were staggered at how much attention is lavished on a show with flowers.' In all the time he's been covering Chelsea, Monty has seen big changes; in particular in the amount sponsors are prepared to pay. 'It's not unusual for people to spend hundreds of thousands on show gardens and a few years ago one show garden crossed the £1 million mark. Alan walked away from the programme that he had presented for 30 years after hearing rumours that Monty was tipped to takeover . The worry is that if Chelsea becomes too dominated by big money then you can lose the element of risk. People are afraid to try something new. 'But the people who run Chelsea are aware of that and a few years ago they introduced an area where young designers are given the chance to show off what they can do on smaller patches. We all know we need to encourage young people to come into this world.' Monty's been gardening since he was seven. His mother, who had five children and also looked after her own mother who was suffering from Alzheimer's, would send her children out into the garden to save her sanity and also to grow fruit and veg that would feed the family. His father, a soldier, was often not around. 'There was a lot of work to do; wood to chop, coal to get. Until the late 60s we had no central heating or freezer; none of the mod cons we take for granted. Life was busy but it taught us how important it is to work hard.' Gardening was always a hobby; in his teens he gardened for neighbours and worked his way through Cambridge University, where he read English. It never crossed his mind to take it up as a profession. Monty has no gardening qualifications but he has been reporting on Chelsea for 30 years so has lots of experience . 'If you're someone from my background, which is middle class, it's assumed you'll become a teacher or a doctor, or something like that. If I'd said I wanted to be a gardener it would have been seen as a wasted opportunity. Looking back, that's appalling.' At that point he and his wife Sarah - who he met at Cambridge - had seen their jewellery company collapse. They lost their home and Monty had to go on the dole to keep the family - by then they'd had their three children - afloat. 'I had to start again from scratch,' he says. He began writing about his first love, gardening, and then presenting. The jobs started rolling in and when he took over as the main host on Gardeners' World in 2003 he was the first amateur to do it. He worked as hard as he possibly could, waking up at 3.45am to fit everything in. 'Losing a house gives you a refugee mentality,' he says. 'You always think the rug is going to be pulled away from under your feet. There's a fine line between enjoying work and working hard and looking after your family and ensuring your family has everything they need; and overworking.' It's a lesson he learned the hard way. In 2008 he had a minor stroke. First he tried to shrug off the symptoms, and even after he was diagnosed he tried to go back to work almost immediately but realised he just couldn't do it and had to give up Gardeners' World. It's only in the last few years he's been able to get back to work properly; he started back on Gardeners' World in 2011, but only on the proviso that he could do it from his own garden, the glorious Longmeadow in Herefordshire. But now he seems to be working as hard as ever; as well as Gardeners' World, which continues until November, and Chelsea, he's been presenting a Channel 4 show called Real Craft and is also filming a new BBC show called Big Dreams, Small Spaces, creating gardens for people with little space. After that he'll make another BBC show, The Secret History Of Gardens, before a new series of his Radio 4 show Shared Planet, exploring the relationships between humans and wildlife. 'You always think the rug is going to be . pulled away from under your feet. There's a fine line between enjoying  and overworking.' 'I'm working harder than ever but now I've learned to pace myself,' he says. 'My stroke was a warning shot and I'm careful now. I don't do things that are too demanding. And I've learned to relax more; I've got better at taking time off and turning the phone off and not looking at the email. I do yoga every day which helps with the relaxation and I've also learned to just not care about certain things. I've realised there are more important things in life than being on TV.' The new relaxed Monty is a happier one. He's been plagued by depression since his 20s; describing it as 'great spans of muddy time' where he'd struggle to get out of bed. Gardening was his consolation, but not a cure. For that he needed pills, light boxes and therapy. He seems to surprise himself when he admits his depression has been almost non-existent in recent years. 'I think with age you learn to manage your resources,' he says. 'I think not getting over-tired is very important. If you're doing work you like that helps. And I have a very good support system. I'm lucky I adore my wife. Every year our relationship seems to get better. I also feel happier in myself.' A famously organic gardener - who often provokes anger from chemical companies when he suggests alternatives to pesticides in his Weekend column - he says he gets a lot of letters from readers terrified of plant diseases, but he advises them to ignore smaller problems and only worry about big ones. And that's how he now lives his life. 'In gardening, as in life, you should look at the bigger picture. It's all about balance. If you get the balance right, things will look after themselves.' The Chelsea Flower Show coverage starts on BBC1 tomorrow at 5.35pm, then runs daily until 25 May, on BBC1 from 3pm and BBC2 from 8pm.","Monty Don will be presenting this year's RHS Chelsea Flower Show .

"Gloucester have announced the signing of New Zealand international lock Jeremy Thrush. Thrush, who has won 11 caps for the All Blacks, will join Gloucester after the World Cup later this year. The 29-year-old will head to Kingsholm from Wellington-based Super Rugby side the Hurricanes. Gloucester have announced the signing of New Zealand international lock Jeremy Thrush . Thrush is expected to be part of the All Blacks squad that defends their world title in September and October. He toured Europe with the world champions earlier this season. Gloucester rugby director David Humphreys said: 'Signing a player of Jeremy's ability further highlights Gloucester's ambition to compete with the best clubs in Europe. 'He has been a stand-out performer in Super Rugby over a number of seasons, and the experience he has gained being part of a successful All Blacks squad will be a key element in establishing Gloucester as one of the dominant forward packs in England. 'His recent man-of-the-match performance against Scotland showed what Jeremy will bring to Gloucester in terms of his rugby ability, but he will also add huge value to the squad, both on and off the field, through his leadership abilities. 'As we continue to build our squad for the 2015/16 season, our initial focus was the retention of key players who were out of contract. Thrush, who has won 11 caps for the All Blacks, will join Gloucester after the World Cup later this year . 'This has now been done, and with Jeremy's announcement this morning, we will continue to add strength in depth to our squad over the next few weeks.' Under Humphreys' direction, Gloucester made a number of new signings for the current campaign, including half-backs Greig Laidlaw and James Hook, former New Zealand Test prop John Afoa and current Wales hooker Richard Hibbard. And Gloucester have pushed themselves closer to being in Aviva Premiership play-off contention after successive league victories over Exeter and Saracens. Gloucester chief executive Stephen Vaughan added: 'The addition of a top-quality All Black like Jeremy to our squad demonstrates our determination to keep building towards having a squad capable of consistently challenging for honours going forward. 'We began a rebuilding process this season by introducing a completely new coaching set-up and a host of new players, and we see this exciting announcement as further reinforcement of our total commitment to investing in the playing squad.'

"Hidden behind bamboo and hedges near Wimbledon Common lies an architectural gem - a futuristic house made of glass and yellow-painted steel, with Technicolor trimmings. Built by celebrated architect Richard Rogers in 1968 for his parents, the south-west London home has been in the family ever since. But now, for the first time, the single-storey property is going on the market and it could be yours... if you can afford the £3.2million asking price. 22 Parkside, in Wimbledon, south-west London, was designed by architect Richard Rogers for his parents in the 1960s . The Grade II*-listed property is on sale for the first time, with an asking price of £3.2m . Each end of the house has massive walls of glass looking out on to a courtyard and landscaped gardens . Lord Rogers, who designed some of the world's most iconic buildings, including London's Lloyd's building, Terminal Five at Heathrow Airport and the notorious Millennium Dome, once described the house as 'the most successful small project I have been involved in'. The Grade II*-listed building, known as Rogers House, has an open interior with very flexible partitions - if, for example, the new owner wishes to create another bedroom. It was this modernist project which inspired him to co-create one of his most famous buildings, the Pompidou centre in Paris, which opened its doors in 1977. Rogers House, as it is known, currently contains a large open-plan kitchen, living room and dining room, three bedrooms, a bathroom and utility room . Lord Rogers (above), who turned 80 today, said: 'The house was built for my parents, a potter and a physician, and designed by Su Rogers [his then wife] and me' Lord Rogers, who turned 80 today, said: 'Overlooking . Wimbledon Park, and yet invisible from the street, is a single-storey . modern house built for my parents, a potter and a physician, and . designed by Su Rogers [his then wife] and me. 'I was born in Italy and spent my . early life surrounded by beautiful, historic and modern architecture and . this has had an effect on all my work. 'My mother loved to cook and so the . open-plan kitchen is the heart of the house where family and friends . could gather, very much in the Italian way.' The freehold property, at 22 Parkside, is on the . market with estate agent The Modern House - and currently contains a large open-plan . kitchen, living room and dining room. It also has a main bedroom, two smaller bedrooms, a bathroom and utility room. Each end of the house has massive walls of glass looking out on to a courtyard and landscaped gardens. There is also a separate studio and housekeeper's flat. The property was granted heritage status in February - putting it in the top 8 per cent of all listed buildings in England. Lord Rogers added: 'The approach used to . design this building inspired much of my future work, including the . Centre Pompidou, designed with Renzo Piano, and Lloyd’s of London, which . has now been Grade I-listed. 'The house is made up of prefabricated . components, principally steel and glass, which can be adapted to . changing requirements. Today, my son Ab Rogers and his family live and . work in the house and have adapted it to suit their needs.' Lord Rogers, who designed some of the world's most iconic buildings, including London's Lloyd's building, Terminal Five at Heathrow Airport and the notorious Millennium Dome, once described the house as 'the most successful small project I have been involved in' The main house, designed to allow an entirely flexible internal space, represented British Architecture at the 1967 Paris Biennale . The sale of the house coincides with the Richard Rogers: Inside Out exhibition at the Royal Academy in London. The house is one of very few in Britain to stand comparison with the finest 20th-century houses in America and mainland Europe, and one of a very small number of modernist houses to have been given the Grade II* listing by English Heritage. Although the design is rooted in the classic Modern style - established by the likes of Mies van der Rohe and Richard Neutra - in terms of its construction, it represents a radical departure from what had come before. The main house, designed to allow an entirely flexible internal space, represented British Architecture at the 1967 Paris Biennale. It has been described as 'the most technically interesting and visually striking house in Europe' (Richard Einzig in Classic Modern Houses in Europe) and 'a masterpiece from one of the most imaginative and exciting periods in private house building', according to the Culture Minister Ed Vaizey.

"Not since Julie Andrews has a singing nun caused such a stir in the abbey. A Sicilian nun has become the fastest growing internet phenomenon of all time after performing on the Italian version of The Voice. Sister Cristina Scuccia, who stunned judges with her version of an Alicia Keys song, belted out in full habit, has racked up 30-million hits on YouTube in just seven days. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sister Act: Sister Cristina Scuccia stunned judges with her version of an Alicia Keys song which she belted out in full habit . Gift from above: When Sister Cristina gave her rendition of the U.S. star¿s hit No One the judges looked stunned . The starry eyed sister said she was now 'definitely expecting a call from Pope Francis' The previous record holder was the unforgettable Gangnam Style by Korean pop star Psy which racked up 10-million views in 18 days, before going on to reach almost 2-billion clicks. When Sister Cristina gave her rendition of the U.S. star’s hit No One the first judge to turn around was tattooed Italian rapper J-Ax. His jaw dropped when he saw where the heavenly voice had come from. He later joked: ‘If I'd had a nun like you at Sunday school I'd be pope now.’ The bad boy judge swiftly recruited her for his team saying: ‘We'd be unbeatable together, the Devil and Holy Water. ‘. 'Are you a real nun?', another visibly amazed judge asked Sister Cristina. She insisted: 'Very real indeed. I have a gift and I've come to give it to you.' Support: Sister Cristina Scuccia brought nuns from her convent who looked delighted at her performance . Hit: The first judge to turn around was tattooed Italian rapper J-Ax who couldn't believe his eyes when he realised the singer was a nun . Shock: 'Are you a real nun?', another visibly amazed judge asked Sister Cristina . The starry eyed sister said she was now 'definitely expecting a call from Pope Francis'. The idea is not as far fetched as one might think, given the pontiff’s habit for making phone calls to parishioners and nuns. Cristina, who grew up in a small town outside Palermo, got her first taste of stardom aged 17 when she was offered the starring role in a musical put on by an order of nuns about their founder St Ursula. The UK version of The Voice has the judges Ricky Wilson, Sir Tom Jones, Will.i.am and Kylie Minogue . 'It all started off as a bit of fun, getting into the role, but as every performance went by I realised that my life was changing,' she told an Italian magazine.The next year she became a novice and took her holy orders two years ago, while continuing to take signing and dancing classes. She also auditioned for X-factor. Sister Cristina claims that her musical antics are in line with Francis' pastoral recommendation for priests to reach out to people in the street. 'Who said that a nun cannot perform? It gives out a strong signal if a young woman who has consecrated her life to God continues to do things that any person of my age would do,' Cristina was quoted as saying by Italian newspaper La Repubblica. Heavenly: Not since Julie Andrews has a singing nun caused such a stir in the abbey . The audition, which aired a week ago, attracted 13 million views on the You Tube website in the first three days. Gangnam Style remains the most watched YouTube video ever. But when it was first published, it took 18 days - rather than three - to pass the 10-million-hits mark. The previous record holder was Gangnam Style by Korean pop star Psy . The unlikely TV contestant’s popularity has been boosted by Alicia Keys herself. 'Now, THAT'S what beautiful, pure energy looks like! Sing it, sister Christina!' the U.S. singer posted on Twitter, along with a link to the nun's video.Whoopi Goldberg, who played a pop star who seeks refuge by disguising herself a a nun in the film Sister Act, also lent her support tweeting the link to the video and writing: 'For when you want a taste of sister act!'","Sister Cristina Scuccia stunned judges on The Voice in Italy .

"Over the past four years David Bez has changed job, moved house, had a son, made over 1,000 salads - and had his first book published. He is the salad man, and he's determined to sex up its image. 'It upsets me that people overlook salads; they see them as an unsexy side dish when they can be a fantastic meal in their own right,' says David. 'Salads are amazing. They can be varied and creative. They can be light or heavy, hot or cold. It's a broad spectrum that I never get bored with.' Salad love: David Bez is determined to get the nation hooked on green stuff again . David, 40, a graphic designer, has had no cookery training and had never even considered himself to be a foodie until he moved to London from his native Milan in Italy seven years ago. With a busy job as head of design at the Discovery Channel, he depended on takeaways and ready meals at his desk for his lunches. But then he put on nearly 2st and began to feel tired and lethargic. Meanwhile, two close friends were diagnosed with cancer and David started to worry about his own health. 'I've never thought of myself as a foodie, I just knew I liked food like any Italian,' he says. 'In Italy people don't think about food and what is healthy because it's all there anyway,' he says. 'There aren't really any ready meals and most meals have fresh vegetables. But living in England helped me make the connection between food and health. My mother died of breast cancer a few years ago and when friends my age started to get really ill it made me think about the food I was eating.' David says that salads add a plethora of exciting combination options . He began to make his own meals for work. 'Initially I didn't call them salads, I just wanted to eat healthily. But then I realised that's what they were.' Then he started to take salad seriously, doing a big shop on a Monday and taking over the office fridge. In his drawer was a chopping board, knife, peeler and a variety of spices and seeds, while on the window near his desk he started to grow a selection of herbs. He also wanted to be creative; no boring salads for him. 'I knew a lot of people who ate the same salads all the time - I wanted to break away from that and create something colourful and incredible.' Not surprisingly he started to get attention from his colleagues. 'People in the office would stop and watch what I was doing. They definitely thought I was a bit eccentric, but I think they admired the way I did it every day. Some would say, ""What the hell is that?"" and tell me to come down to the pub with them, but others would say, ""That looks amazing!"" I'm a keen photographer so I started taking pictures just before I ate the salad, and that's when I decided to set myself a challenge and do a blog.' That was four years ago, and his challenge was '365 days of salads' in which he would make a salad every lunchtime in the office. His blog attracted attention from salad lovers, and though he finished the challenge - and lost that 2st - he still makes a salad every day. 'If it looks mouthwatering you've got them. Even if it is ""only"" a salad.' The blog now has more than 40,000 daily viewers and has been turned into a book, Salad Love, which is being serialised in Weekend over the next three weeks. The book features his favourite 260 salads from the blog, and the photos are the ones he took shortly before he started munching away. 'My aim is to create the perfect salad. The Japanese believe it takes eight years to master something, so maybe I'll have to do this for another four years,' he laughs. He's had a few disasters. 'Once I mixed black beans and beetroot and it was dreadful,' he says. 'And I tried adding chocolate - I won't be doing that again.' But trial and error have helped him fine-tune what he likes in a salad; not too many ingredients so that you can taste each one, plus plenty of vegetables, one or two types of protein, herbs and a dressing. His favourite in the book is a mixture of brown rice, black beans, tomato, avocado and chilli. 'It blew my mind in a way that I didn't expect,' he laughs. He tries to avoid buying veggies out of season, and compensates for the winter cold by adding hot couscous, rice or quinoa, and warming spices like ginger and chilli. He lives in east London with his wife Vera and three-year-old son Nico, and recently left his job at Discovery to work as a freelance designer while hoping his book will open further doors. 'A lot of people ask me on my blog when I'm going to open a restaurant and that's something I'd think about,' he says. 'Everything that's happened is amazing - I don't know what the future holds but I want to continue developing my knowledge of food and writing about it.' While he never had a mission in mind, he likes the idea of inspiring people to eat more healthily. 'I realised that if you want to appeal to everyone, then it should be through the beauty of it,' he says. 'If it looks mouthwatering you've got them. Even if it is ""only"" a salad.'

"Hugh Dennis has all the appearance of a grown-up: greying hair, deep and commanding voice, successful job. But there's more than a little bit of the child in the 52-year-old comedian and star of Outnumbered. 'I love rolling down hills,' he confesses. 'I do it whenever I can - though preferably not when people are watching. There's a bank in my garden on the South Downs that's very good for rolling down.' Hugh Dennis has launched a National Trust campaign to get 200,000 kids playing outside this summer . We're talking about the great outdoors because Hugh has just been unveiled as the new face of the National Trust's campaign to get children to enjoy the countryside more - and he's on a roll, as it were. 'There's another game I like to play where I pretend to be a stuntman. It's best if you're on a sand dune. You run along a sand dune, then pretend you've been hit by an arrow and tumble down the dune. You can't possibly hurt yourself - it's great. 'Oh, and I love trees too. We shot a film for the campaign the other day and I had to hide in a hollow tree. I could have stayed there for ages but the crew made me come out. I know I'm much happier outdoors than in. I like nothing more than standing on a hill in the middle of a gale. I love it.' The campaign, called 50 Things To Do Before You're 11¾, aims to get children playing outside after research suggested the time they spend outdoors has halved in a generation. Some 50 per cent of today's children spend less than an hour outside each day, compared to their parents' childhood average of 2½ hours. Among the activities on the list are flying kites, climbing trees and hunting for bugs, and the Trust is organising 1,000 events at its venues over the summer to get children connecting with nature. Unlike many proponents of the campaign, Hugh, who has a son Freddie, 17, and daughter Meg, 15, with his garden designer second wife Kate Abbot-Anderson, is no zealot. Hugh says he is far more fun than his on screen character Pete in Outnumbered . Ever reasonable, as you might expect from the man who played modern dad Pete Brockman to perfection in Outnumbered, he's realistic about the temptations of computer games that keep children indoors. 'The danger is you can get very negative about technology, but I wish I'd had an iPad when I was a kid. You need a balance. You don't want your children to be on their computers all the time just because you can't be bothered to take them somewhere interesting. They learn things by seeing what's out there. I've always tried to get my kids to enjoy nature, but I don't think I've been any more successful than anyone else.' Hugh had an idyllic if eccentric childhood growing up in east London, the son of a vicar (later a bishop) and a teacher. Although he was desperate for a dog, his parents bought a cat instead - but he insisted on pretending it was a dog and even took it for walks using a washing line as a lead. He remembers, more than anything, the freedom he had as a child. 'I was getting the bus to school from the age of five with my brother, who's two years older than me,' he recalls. 'I never had to tell my parents what time I was going to be home. I loved having time to wander about and nobody would worry. 'Our home was a big, dilapidated Victorian house. At the end of the garden was a bombsite and I remember digging for snails... actually I have great trouble resisting that kind of thing now. My parents were always very reasonable. Hugh first found fame with the BBC comedy, My Hero . 'When I was growing up there were discussions about whether certain things were good or bad, but I don't remember being told off. That's why I'm such a reasonable person. I try to be like my parents and I have these great waves of guilt when I don't quite manage it. It's very difficult, bringing up children.' He says he tries to be a different sort of dad from the ultimately self-defeating Pete in Outnumbered. 'I'd like to think I command a lot more respect than Pete,' he laughs. 'But I'm not sure that's true. Whenever I watch Outnumbered I do think Pete often behaves in exactly the opposite way to how I would.' Unusually - perhaps uniquely - for a celebrity, Hugh has no stories of angst, bullying or depression. The one regret in his life is that he wasn't able to make his first marriage - to childhood sweetheart Miranda Carroll - work, but then he's never been happier than he is with Kate and their children. He never harboured dreams of fame and fortune; although naturally witty, he only ever saw comedy as a hobby until it started taking over his life. Educated at the private University College School in London and then Cambridge, where he read geography, he only joined the Footlights drama club because it seemed like the thing to do. 'I'd only ever appeared in one play before and when I joined the Footlights it was never with the idea of making a career out of it,' he recalls. When he left Cambridge with a First MI5 tried to recruit him, but he turned them down because he 'didn't want to do people over'. Instead he worked in Unilever's marketing department and carried on with the comedy with writing partner Steve Punt, yet still saw it as a sideline when the pair started appearing on Jasper Carrott's BBC1 comedy shows. 'But then Steve and I were offered The Mary Whitehouse Experience and I knew I wouldn't be able to combine it with work,' he says. 'So I said to my boss, ""I don't know what to do. I've been offered this show on BBC2 and you're about to send me to Milan."" He said, ""What do mean you don't know what to do? Just go and do that."" They gave me a sabbatical so I could see how it worked out, but I never went back. 'My career was never a deliberate, terribly focused thing, I've just been tremendously lucky. I'm doing something I love and I'm lucky that my hobby - though I hate that word because it sounds like I'm doing miniature ship building - became my job.' Hugh regularly appears on the panel of Mock the Week . Fame came slowly, first with BBC1 comedy My Hero, then with Mock The Week and Outnumbered. The last series of Outnumbered finished earlier this year, though the hope is there'll be more stand-alone episodes. 'We're still all in touch and we're told there'll be specials,' he says. 'I don't think it ended because the kids are grown up and the stories aren't there. It's more because they're appearing in their own things. Trying to get everyone together is like trying to organise a family holiday when your children have left home.' He laughs about the fact that his fame has reached around the world. 'A man recently stopped me and said, ""Sir, you are a very big star in Zimbabwe,"" as My Hero is still being shown in his country. I still can't fathom it,' he shrugs. 'But I'm pleased people know my name rather than asking, ""You're, erm, erm, what's your name again?"" like they used to.' He says he regularly gets asked for his autograph in the street now - something that causes great embarrassment to his children. 'Oh, I embarrass them all the time,' he guffaws. 'Sometimes I'll find myself dancing in the kitchen and then I see them standing there with this very stern ""What are you doing?"" look on their faces. Kids are never gentle. They never take you in a corner and say, ""We'd prefer it if you didn't do that."" They just say, ""Dad, don't ever do that again."" But if you can't embarrass your children, what's the point of having them?' And then off this lovely, unassuming man skips - presumably looking for a hill to roll down.

"When she was the most famous hooker in showbusiness - thanks to career-defining roles in the 1986 film Mona Lisa and Kay Mellor's 90s TV hit Band Of Gold - Cathy Tyson had a reputation for being a bit chippy. She'd arrive late for interviews, answer questions dismissively and even turned Hollywood down after being told to lose weight. She's just returned to the acting world after a four-year break in which she went to university to study literature and drama, and how she's changed. Cathy Tyson alongside Bob Hoskins in Mona Lisa, she says Bob had a huge influence on her career . Cathy's now 48 and still has the perfectly sculpted cheekbones and feline eyes that made her one of Britain's most recognisable stars. Only now her corkscrew Afro hair is tinged with grey and, I'm relieved to see, she has a big smile on her face. She hooks her arm into mine as we search for somewhere to eat in the rundown south London suburb where she's rehearsing for her latest play. She's just thrown herself headlong into work; after finishing critically acclaimed play Snakes And Ladders she's about to start new show Stand - a play about people standing up for what they believe in - in Oxford. But there's a sad tinge when we meet, with the death from pneumonia of Bob Hoskins, with whom she co-starred in Mona Lisa. 'He was the most genial of men,' she recalls. 'Everyone loved working with him, and nobody had a bad word to say about him. He always gave advice freely and willingly, and with his help I became a better actress. 'Mona Lisa was my first film and I was extremely nervous. Bob made me instantly feel at ease. He invited me around to dinner before we started shooting the movie and from the beginning he was a lovely, encouraging man. He always had a big wide smile on his face and you could talk to him about anything. He was the first male actor I saw cry and that encouraged me to show my own emotions more while acting. I learnt so much from him; not only when it came to acting and how to be in front of cameras but even how to talk to the press. Cathy Tyson starring in her recent play about black hairdressers - Snakes and Ladders . 'We stayed in contact for a long time and I still have the postcard he sent me from Los Angeles when Mona Lisa first came out there. It was a huge billboard of us from the film and he wrote, ""Look at us!"" I last saw him about three or four years ago when he'd moved back to north London. 'We bumped into each other in the street and it was so nice to see him. He instantly invited me to a party at his house which I couldn't go to because of work. I'm still so sad and shocked that he died so young - to me 71 is young. I was sad I hadn't seen more of him over the past few years but I know he had a happy life. He was surrounded by family and people who loved him and he had a great body of work. He was someone who made Britain proud.' Cathy put her career - which had most recently included successful productions with the RSC and a spell in Emmerdale - on hold after growing 'jaded' with life. 'I'd lost my appetite for work,' she says. 'I didn't like the parts I was reading for. I've always wanted to study but as an actor you're always worried about missing that one big job. Finally I just thought, ""I'm going to risk it.""' 'I . wanted to be white. There was this fantasy that if I was white I'd have . no problems.' So she rented out her house and took a student loan, moved into digs at Brunel University and buried her head in her books. 'I'm delighted I did it because it's changed everything,' she beams. 'It's given me a confidence I never had before. I was so miserable in my own life. I didn't live outside of work. I didn't have a social life, or the social skills to meet people. It's shown me new things aren't just for the young. The only problem was, when I finished university I worried I was too content to act. I always did my best work when I was miserable. But I suppose there's always something to worry about,' she laughs. Cathy's always been a worrier. The only child of a Trinidadian barrister father who was largely absent during her childhood and a British social worker mother, she never had much time for school apart from drama lessons. She'd regularly play truant and when she was 13 ran away from home, finding a job as a chambermaid in London for a week before she was tracked down by the police and sent home. 'I was a . bit of a rebel and I found Liverpool totally uninspiring,' she says. 'I . knew I didn't want to stay there. We lived in a block of flats which was . mainly filled with single mothers. Many of them were nice but there . were lots of things that made me frightened to walk out the door. The . whole area was racist and there was a lot of joyriding and mugging.' Being . told 'go back to where you come from' was normal and she still recalls . being told that if she rubbed her skin enough it would turn white. 'I . wanted to be white. There was this fantasy that if I was white I'd have . no problems.' Cathy's most famous role was a prostitute in Band Of Gold, however she said this was the most miserable period of her life . For Cathy acting was a release, a way of coping with her emotions, and a way out of Liverpool. After a spell at Liverpool's Everyman Theatre - where the likes of Julie Walters, Pete Postlethwaite and Jonathan Pryce began their careers - she joined the RSC. By then she'd already met and married Red Dwarf actor Craig Charles (now mini-cab driver Lloyd in Coronation Street) after she saw him perform in Liverpool. 'He was one of the first men I really had a conversation with; he could speak,' she says. Within a month of being together she proposed. 'I was a feminist and he said yes. It was crazy, I didn't even know who I was, let alone who he was.' They married in 1984 when she was 19 and he was 20. Two years later she was thrust into the limelight with the success of Mona Lisa, in which she played a high-class prostitute with Bob Hoskins as her ex-con driver. Hollywood came calling but she was terrified when hints were dropped by agents that she needed to lose weight. 'I was frightened when people told me to . lose weight. I thought, ""I want people to . judge what's coming out of my mouth rather than what I look like. I've . got a brain.""' 'I turned down several auditions which was silly but I was frightened when people told me to lose weight because I was already skinny. I thought, ""I want people to judge what's coming out of my mouth rather than what I look like. I've got a brain.""' Her career was temporarily stalled by the birth of her son Jack in 1988. But by then her marriage was crumbling and they divorced when Jack was still a baby. Cathy's reluctant to talk about Craig's well-publicised drug problems but says the pair finally have 'a respectful relationship' because of their musician son. She's never married again; nor had a serious relationship. 'I suppose I need to be stimulated to stay with the same person.' In 1995 she took on her other most famous role; as another prostitute in Band Of Gold. Despite its success she says it was one of the most miserable periods of her life. 'I was still finding my feet and angry,' she says. 'My marriage had disintegrated and I felt shame. I don't think I was clinically depressed but I was very troubled.' Many older actresses insist they're happier to have left their nubile 20s behind, but I've never believed any of them as much as I believe Cathy. 'I'm so grateful to be older and be in the space I am now,' she says. 'If only I knew back then what I know now.' Cathy will be appearing in Stand at the Oxford Playhouse, from 29 May.

"She was once known as horticultural Viagra but now, at the age of 47, Charlie Dimmock says she's too old for marriage . Charlie Dimmock's smile is as wide as it ever was. It is the smile that, along with the scarlet Botticelli curls and penchant for not wearing a bra, made her the gardening world's most famous pin-up. But it's hard to know what is behind the smile. Time has moved on from when she was a huge TV star both here, thanks to the popularity of Ground Force which was watched by 12 million people when it moved from BBC2 to BBC1, and in the US where she hosted a gardening segment for CBS's breakfast show. Back then, nicknamed 'horticultural Viagra' she sold more calendars than top models and pop bands. The passage from there to here hasn't been kind. She still refuses to talk about the death of her mother and stepfather during the Boxing Day Tsunami a decade ago but it's clear its impact was huge. For two years after she lost her beloved mum she turned down all offers of work and retreated to the New Forest house she'd been left in the will. By the time she was ready to work again the ship had sailed in the fickle world of television. There were new earthy women like Kate Humble and Sarah Beeny to obsess over. But she insists that fame is something she's seen come and go with equanimity. 'It's quite nice to not have such a high profile although I am not sure my agent would agree,' she grins. 'I always found the fame thing a bit odd. I'd walk along the high street and find lots of people staring at me. It was intimidating; at first I would wonder whether I had left my flies undone. 'The sex symbol thing was the most surprising thing of all. It was silly, totally ridiculous. I started Ground Force when I was 33 and I hadn't been sexy until that point so I don't know how I would suddenly become sexy. So silly. 'Because of all the fuss I did get some dodgy letters. I had a marriage proposal from Australia, from some farmer in the middle of the outback. Now if people stop me in the street it's because they want to tell me, ""We'd love you to bring Ground Force back"". But I tell them, ""We're too old"". I think it's a show that was of its time; we had great fun doing it but it was a different era.' Charlie with her mother, Sue who tragically died in the Boxing Day Tsunami . Since then her career has veered off in all sorts of strange directions. She is still primarily a gardening expert and we are talking because she's hosting a series of presentations at the Blenheim Palace Flower Show later this month with her former Ground Force colleague Tommy Walsh, who was the construction expert on the programme. Until this year they hadn't worked together since Ground Force finished in 2005. 'We saw each other yesterday and within seconds I was nagging him and he was saying ""Bloody hell, I forgot what you were like,""' she giggles. Charlie Dimmock and Alan Titchmarsh on the set of Ground Force . Charlie can also now put actress down on her CV. She took a short role in the 2010 touring production of Calendar Girls, happily acknowledging 'they didn't ask me because of my acting ability'. In the show – as in the film about a group of WI activists who make a naked calendar for charity – she was forced to go nude. 'It's very well-choreographed so you can't see anything but it was still pretty nerve-racking,' she says. 'I got used to taking my clothes off – after about a month – but the acting was terrifying.' Since then she's become a panto regular. 'I lend myself to Jack And The Beanstalk very well,' she laughs. 'It's very silly but it's a good experience.' Charlie never expected to be famous; she had her career mapped out in a very different direction. The plan was to take over the Mill Water garden centre which she already managed, near the New Forest home where she grew up. When she was picked to be the water features expert on Ground Force, after being spotted at Mill Water by a producer, she was living with long term boyfriend John Mushet but the two split when she had a fling with the show's sound man Andy Simmonds. Mushet later said she had 'changed' after finding fame but she says now 'the relationship would never have lasted, it was already on its last legs'. That was followed by another short affair with a crew member, another sound technician called Barry Smith, but she has been pretty much single ever since. 'I'm too old now, certainly too old for marriage, there's no point,' she says. When I respond that 47 is not old – certainly not too old for love – she shakes her head. 'You're obviously too young to be cynical. I do think I'm too old now. I can't see anything happening when it comes to romance; somebody would have to really bowl me over. I am quite content without a man in my life. Charlie Dimmock is also an acclaimed actress, having appeared in the theatre production of Calendar Girls . 'I'm quite happy as I am with my cat, my dog and my horse. They're all the company I need. I think that if I did meet someone I'd prefer a partnership to marriage. That's terrible isn't it? Very selfish, that's what they say, isn't it? But I like being able to do what I want.' Sometimes that means going to the local pub after walking her dog, occasionally dinners with friends. But more often it's being on her own, in her garden, with only a radio for company. 'I'm a Radio 4 junkie,' she laughs. 'I don't really watch any TV; radio is so much more useful in the garden. On my ideal day I might spend three or four hours in the garden. And I'll often sit outside in the evenings too, watching the birds on the bird feeders and the different creatures in the pond. There are no streetlights where I live so when the stars are out it's very pretty, you can see all the bats. It makes me feel pretty content.'

"Living in the shadow of a legend isn't easy; just ask Frank Sinatra Jr. He's had 70 years to get used to being known as 'the son of', but there are still things that rankle - and supposedly long-lost brothers coming out of the woodwork is one of them. Six months ago Mia Farrow, who was Frank Sinatra Sr's third wife for just 18 months in the late 60s, claimed in Vanity Fair magazine that her 26-year-old son Ronan - presumed to be her ex-lover Woody Allen's son - could 'possibly' have been fathered by Sinatra Sr who, she said, she 'never really split up from'. Frank Sinatra Jr (left) with his father Frank Sinatra Sr in the 1960s . The story had credence as Ronan, a blue-eyed journalist and former US government adviser, looks more like Frank than Woody. 'No, he's not my half-brother,' says Frank Jr, whose mother Nancy Barbato was the crooner's first wife. 'They weren't in touch; he was remarried and so was she. It was a shock when I heard what Mia said but I've since learned she was being interviewed by somebody she regarded as an idiot and when that person made the suggestion about Ronan she flippantly said, ""Oh yes, of course."" It was a joke. I don't think Ronan looks like Sinatra; he looks like her. Thank God for him that he doesn't look like Woody! I've never met him but I've seen his photo. He's a handsome young man but he's not Sinatra's son.' However, there's no doubt about Frank Jr's parentage; he's the image of his father even if he has inherited his mother's brown eyes rather than Sinatra Sr's famous blue ones. Frank Sinatra Jr performing in Hollywood in 2008 . For most of his own singing career he tried to step away from his father and make his own music, but in recent years he's changed his tune. He now tours around the world with his jazz band; his act is Sinatra Sings Sinatra and he'll be crooning all the old classics in the UK next week at the Cheltenham Jazz Festival alongside Jamie Cullum and Jools Holland. 'I feel like the audience looks to me to keep Sinatra alive,' says Frank Jr, who always refers to his father by his surname. 'I've sung my own songs in the past but no one was interested. Now people say my voice is just like his. If you're going to be compared to someone, why not the best?' Frank Jr, whose big sister Nancy forged a singing career and little sister Tina is an actress-turned-TV producer, grew up in LA, where Ol' Blue Eyes was a loving but distant father. For Frank Jr that became more pronounced when his parents divorced when he was six after Sinatra fell in love with Ava Gardner. 'We didn't see much of him; sometimes only once a year. He was making movies, recording albums, doing concerts. Of course it affected us but we had to learn to live with it.' It soon became clear Frank Jr had a talent for music like his father. Aged 19 he went on tour with his band and that's when one of the most traumatic events of his life occurred. Two drifters, Barry Keenan and Joe Amsler, spotted his name on a theatre poster and plotted his kidnapping. 'They decided the best way to make a great deal of money in a short space of time was to hold a rich man's kid for a ransom,' he recalls. On the evening of 8 December, 1963, they knocked on the door of his hotel room. 'They pretended they were delivering a Christmas package. The next thing I knew this guy had a gun in my face.' Frank Sr immediately offered $1m (£5m today), though the not-terribly-bright kidnappers stuck with what they'd planned and demanded just $240,000 (£1m today). Six months ago Mia Farrow claimed in Vanity Fair magazine that her  son Ronan  could 'possibly' have been fathered by Sinatra Sr . 'I thought my life was over,' says Frank. 'I'd been blindfolded and held in a dirty house. It was like being in a movie. I knew they were in contact with Sinatra but I had no idea what was going to happen.' His ordeal lasted four days; the money was handed over and Frank Jr released. The kidnappers were caught when one of them boasted about what he'd got away with. Frank Jr was shaken but, in his eyes, worse was to come. 'The kidnappers made up a story there'd never been an abduction; that I'd planned it as a publicity stunt. This was much worse than the crime itself; I was made out to be a deceitful, despicable person. And the whole world thought it was true. It's hard to take when you've just turned 20.' Even though his kidnappers were jailed, Frank Jr says his reputation was ruined. 'It definitely affected my career. People didn't trust me; they thought there's no smoke without fire.' 'Apparently being frightened of the . shadow cast by your father is something people think about; I don't. My . attitude is to be what I am, not try to be what I'm not' Still, he carried on as a musician and in 1988 his father, who he now saw even more rarely, invited him to be musical director of his tour – a position he held until Frank Sr's final performance in 1995, three years before his death. 'Being his musical director enabled me to spend time in his life, which meant I could give something back to him. That gave me a deep personal satisfaction. He'd fed me and clothed me and educated me; I wanted to know that I could contribute as well as receive.' They were closer than ever; but it didn't mean they suddenly became best buddies. 'He always had so many people vying for his attention. I believed the more invisible I became, the better I was doing my job. But it was a happy time and when we came to the UK it was particularly exciting. I remember when we got to London I went into his dressing room at the Royal Albert Hall and damn near tripped over Sir Alec Guinness who was seated there with Richard Harris. 'When we got to Dublin Richard was there again and one morning he took me down to a pub on the dockside and he said, ""Let's sit down, you can meet some of my friends and let's have a couple of bottles of ink (Guinness)."" He got me zonked.' Frank has his own son now, Michael, 27, who has avoided showbusiness and lives in Japan. He tries to see him regularly. Meanwhile, he has accepted his legacy. 'Apparently being frightened of the shadow cast by your father is something people think about; I don't. My attitude is to be what I am, not try to be what I'm not. There's never going to be anyone like my father again and no one knows that more than me.'

"Lesley Nicol's role in Downton Abbey has made her extremely popular in the states . Downton Abbey has brought many things for actress Lesley Nicol: worldwide admiration after a long but unsung career in the business, the chance to spend half the year in a £2 million home in Los Angeles, and a string of rock stars and Hollywood  A-listers queuing up to talk to her. Perhaps the most incongruous is former Guns N' Roses drummer Matt Sorum, whom she met through their work with the charity Animals Asia. 'He came for lunch at my house in Los Angeles and I really didn't think we'd have two words to say to each other because we're from different ends of the planet,' says Lesley. 'He's a rocker and he's got more tattoos than David Beckham but he's gorgeous – and he's a Downton fan. So now I've been to see him play and we've become friendly. How bizarre is that?' she laughs. It's thanks to Downton's popularity in the US that Lesley now spends half her life in LA, where she rents a home in Beverly Hills. It's part work and part play. When she's not out hiking with her husband Da'aboth or having lunch with new friends like Bette Midler, she's auditioning for roles – she's recently had parts in hit shows Once Upon A Time and Raising Hope. Downton attracts its fair share of snipers over here, but in America it's a different story. 'They all love the show,' she says. 'Chelsea Clinton sent me a tweet saying the whole family love it, which was rather sweet. And someone told me Mike Tyson wants to be in it. Bette Midler first got in touch with me by Twitter and we've become friends, and even Harrison Ford said he'd like to be in it. 'But one of my favourite moments came when I met Richard Chamberlain. I was introduced and I told him I'd met him when I was 16 at the stage door when he was playing Hamlet in England. He told me he loved Downton. He was adorable.' In the flesh Lesley, 61, looks a decade younger and a hundred times more polished than Mrs Patmore. When she's filming Downton, which is now shooting its fifth series, she's not allowed to wear make-up, dye her hair, have a tan or even pluck her eyebrows, so she makes up for it when she takes off Mrs Patmore's apron. 'On the show, the ickier I look the better, so it's no surprise I pile the make-up on when I'm allowed to,' she laughs. 'When I met Shirley MacLaine [who plays Lord Grantham's mother-in-law Martha Levinson] in LA she said, ""You don't look like you at all"", because I was all dressed up. It doesn't half cheer you up.' Lesley says that on Downton Abbey, the ickier she looks the better . It's all a world away from the shy showbiz novice Lesley once was. She grew up just outside Manchester; her mother was an amateur actress while her father was a GP. 'I was painfully shy as a child,' she recalls. 'I never imagined I'd go into acting but I always loved drama and when I was 16 I discovered the Library Theatre up the road. So I plucked up courage and asked if I could watch rehearsals. It was like heaven. Then they asked if I wanted a part, and being on stage was like a bolt of lightning. My shyness disappeared. So I applied to the Guildhall drama school and I've been doing it ever since.' Overcoming her shyness has no doubt been helped by Da'aboth, who she married seven years ago. They were introduced by a friend who believed he could help her. Da'aboth, who was born David Keith Heald but changed his name to Da'aboth which means 'black bear', specialises in spiritual therapies. 'The more I got to know him it became clear he was for keeps,' she says. Lesley with one of the moon bears she has helped to free from the bile farm in Nanning, China whilst working with Animals Asia . 'You know when someone isn't around and you wish they were? One of the most immediate things was he took over in my kitchen, and I was deeply grateful. I'm not brilliant and he's a natural cook.' Which is ironic given the grand concoctions Mrs Patmore produces for the Granthams. Perhaps the most life-changing aspect of her Downton fame, she says, is her work with Animals Asia, which campaigns against the cruel practice of Chinese farmers keeping bears in cramped cages and extracting their bile for use in traditional medicines. Lesley got involved through fellow Downton actor Peter Egan, who plays Shrimpie, the Marquess of Flintshire. 'Peter said these bears get a hook into your heart, and it's true,' says Lesley. 'Thanks to Downton I got to go to a bear sanctuary. Even in rural China people watch the show and were excited to meet me, and that's a powerful position to be in. Women of a certain age say to me, ""So there's hope for me yet"", and I tell them, ""Abso-blimmin-lutely!"" People say you can't do this or that because you're too old, but I'm proof it's not true.'

There was huge relief for Gloucester on Saturday as they hung on to claim a vital 26-25 win against Exeter at Sandy Park — condemning the Chiefs to a third straight defeat in the process. The visitors were desperate to initiate a revival after losing five of their previous six league matches and tries by Tom Savage and England No 8 Ben Morgan, allied to 13 points from Greig Laidlaw, propelled them to victory at the end of a thrilling second half. David Humphreys, Gloucester’s director of rugby, said: ‘Today was all about the result. Today was an important start of a new year and it has given us hopefully the little bit of a kick-start to gain some momentum over the next few weeks.’ Gareth Steenson's usually reliable boot let him down on Saturday as Exeter lost to Gloucester by one point .

Surely it seems only about five minutes since Tyger Drew-Honey was the chubby-cheeked, pre-teen, sensible eldest son of the Brockman family in TV’s Outnumbered. But now here he is, aged 18 and all chiselled-features and startling blue eyes, and very much a young man with opinions. After six years of being one of Britain’s favourite sitcoms, Outnumbered may have finished but Tyger is still very much in demand. He’s still acting and recently completed a second series of BBC3’s Cuckoo, but in the meantime he’s turned into a teenage version of Louis Theroux. In his new documentary series, Tyger On . . ., he investigates what it’s like being a teenager in Britain today. Among the topics Tyger has picked are internet ­dating and body image — including the modern cult of the ‘selfie’. One of the most disturbing topics he tackles is pornography. And here Tyger has — somewhat shockingly — a very ­personal perspective on an industry ­ruthlessly targeting modern teens. His full name is Lindzi James Tyger Drew-Honey — an amalgamation of the names of his parents, who were both involved in the porn industry and, in fact, made a fortune from it. His father is Simon Honey, one of the porn industry’s most famous names both for starring in and producing porn films, while his mother Lindzi Drew was a ­glamour model, video porn star (she gave it up when Tyger was born) and the editor of porn magazine Penthouse. Before the internet, there was a lot of money to be made from porn videos; Tyger grew up in a £2 million house in Surrey and was sent to the best schools. Almost inevitably, at his private school, Epsom College, bullies would taunt him about what his parents did; he never showed them how much it hurt. ‘I didn’t react, I would laugh it off and they realised it wouldn’t work,’ he says defiantly. ‘I did get upset, not because of what they were saying but why they were saying it. ‘Why were they trying to hurt me? It made me think they didn’t like me. That’s what I couldn’t understand; I wouldn’t want to deliberately upset someone.’ He insists he was never embarrassed about how his parents made their living: it’s all he ever knew. ‘They were always very open with me,’ he says. Scroll down for video . Tyger is best known for his role in sitcom Outnumbered which recently came to an end . But things did get a bit embarrassing when his parents found him watching porn when he was 14 — he says he’d first found it on the internet after typing in ‘boobs’ when he was ‘eight or nine’. ‘There was no shouting or anything like that, but my dad was worried that I would find something with him in it,’ he says. He was forced to leave his private school after his GCSEs when his parents divorced after 30 years together, and suddenly the money — which had been dwindling due to the rise of free porn on the internet — ran out. He could have paid for the school fees ­himself with his earnings from Outnumbered, but preferred to save his money and taught himself his A-Levels in French, Spanish and psychology, while living in a small, rented house with his mother. He admits that until he made the new documentary — which features him interviewing his parents — he saw pornography only as harmless fun. It was a world he grew up in and his father, whose home is full of porn awards and sex toys, talks openly about it. But looking at the subject with an objective film-maker’s eye, and meeting young men addicted to porn and seeing how it affects all of today’s teenagers, has led to a Damascene-style conversion. ‘When it comes to porn, the internet has changed everything,’ he says. ‘You used to have to go to a shop and buy a DVD if you wanted to watch anything like that. But now all you have to do is type some words into Google and it’s all there for you — and it’s free. Porn baron: Simon Honey, also known as Ben Dover, is pictured with a model at a Big Brother party in 2009 . Tyger's parents Simon Honey who is also known as Ben Dover, left, and Lindzi Drew, right, pictured with her son were both involved in the porn industry . ‘There are not enough ­barriers to stop really young kids watching it. ‘It replaces sex education and there is a whole generation who are growing up with a really warped view about what sex should be about. It feels like this generation is an accident waiting to happen because of our easy access to porn from such a young age.’ What hit Tyger hardest about the dangers of sex films on the internet was when he interviewed a teenage girl whose boyfriend had become hooked on watching rape scenes on porn sites and then started acting out his fantasies without her consent. ‘She was traumatised, and it showed me that porn can ruin lives if it’s not used properly,’ he recalls. ‘It was a massive eye-opener. She was raped repeatedly by her boyfriend, but the interesting thing is she didn’t seem to have any real resentment towards him; she saw them both as victims of pornography.’ Tyger played the role of Jake in Outnumbered and still sees his on-screen siblings Daniel Roche and Romona Marquez . There is, indeed, a lot to worry about when it comes to the mental health of our teenagers. But as his critical judgments on the porn industry suggest, Tyger seems a well-balanced and thoughtful young man. He’s been in the public eye since winning the role of Jake in Outnumbered when he was 12 after being spotted during a school production of ­Treasure Island. The show ended earlier this year, mainly because Tyger and his on-screen siblings are now teenagers rather than cute kids saying funny little things. ‘I’m sad Outnumbered has come to an end, but it’s not the kind of sadness where I wish it had kept on going,’ he says. ‘When something is ready to finish — and this was — it would be detrimental to keep flogging it. With his Outnumbered days over, Tyger, centre, is planning on spending time in France to get to grips with the language . ‘It’s given me a brilliant start to my career, but I’m grown up now and this is my next venture. I feel like I’ve got interesting things to say and I would love to do more documentaries as well as carrying on acting.’ He still sees his on-screen siblings, Daniel Roche, 14, and Ramona Marquez, 13, who were the closest thing he’s ever had to a real brother and sister. He’s funny in an older-brother way when he talks about them. ‘We are close but our different ages makes it hard for us to do things together,’ Tyger says. ‘Ramona is hitting puberty, going to concerts and kissing boys and it’s weird, because that’s not a world I’m into any more. You don’t realise how 13-year-old-ish a 13-year-old is until they reach that age.’ He sighs. ‘When they were younger, I was more like a big brother and they were cute, but now they have become their own people and are very intelligent and argue with me. ‘We get invited to functions together, such as the fifth anniversary of the musical Wicked, and that’s always fun; but if we try to make our own arrangements it’s hard, because Ramona is sitting exams and Dan’s ­normally playing rugby.’ Tyger, meanwhile, is having to adjust to a life of no school and no Outnumbered. Later this year, after a spate of auditions for his next project, he wants to travel and have a period of not working, for the first time since he was 12. He is planning to spend time in France getting to grips with the language. ‘To me, language is the most  fascinating thing in the world,’ he says. ‘I love the way ­languages can mean the same thing but don’t translate ­completely into each other. If I never acted again, I would love to be a translator.’ It’s still hard being a teenager, but Tyger seems to be coping pretty well. ‘The most important thing is to be happy with who you are,’ he says. ‘And I am.’ Tyger On . . . begins on BBC3 on May 15 at 9pm.","Tyger Drew Honey has new documentary series of what it's like to be a teenager in Britain .

"John has won us over with his charm in BBC's Wimbledon commentary box . John McEnroe doesn't take long to list just some of the things that make him angry. 'Well, being in the car would be number one – there's quite a bit of yelling,' he says. 'And then I hate it when someone is not upfront. I'm a tell-it-like-it-is kind of person; I don't like being misled or someone not telling the truth. That upsets me.' His voice gets louder. 'And if people lie to me, especially my kids, well, I'm not big on that. And I also don't like it when people make rash decisions. If people do things without thinking them through, that rubs me up the wrong way.' Clearly, he's still a man you wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of, however charming he may seem in his job as a TV commentator. He may be one of the tennis greats, proud owner of seven Grand Slam singles titles, but he'll always be best known for his tantrums on court, the fury that would be vented at umpires, linesmen... and his racquets. He has a funny relationship with that side of his fame, or perhaps we should call it infamy. On the one hand he realises it made him stand out and got people interested in watching him. But the controversy that surrounded him still rankles. 'Some of it was deserved,' he concedes. 'But it did feel like some of it was completely overboard, particularly in the UK. The attention that's lavished on tennis, especially at Wimbledon, is greater than anything I've experienced. I felt like I was battling everybody. 'I'm 55 now and it would be amazing if a day went by where somebody didn't come up to me and say, ""You cannot be serious!"" But it never happens. That phrase, which I only really said once (at Wimbledon in 1981), is part of me now. It's crazy. When I play at a veterans' tournament – like the Masters Tennis at the Royal Albert Hall in December – if I don't say it people are disappointed. It's ironic – people used to want to suspend me and talk about how bad my behaviour was, but now they like it when I shout and scream.' So how does he sum up his relationship with the great British tennis-loving public? 'It's been a long run, and it's gone to every extreme, but as time marches on it seems like we've found inner peace,' he says. It's fair to say John is pretty much universally loved today as the BBC's charming and knowledgeable tennis commentator. He's also an ambassador for insurance company Aegon, the sponsor of British tennis. 'I'm having a lot more fun than I used to,' he says. 'Now my work is about entertainment rather than a battle to the end. I can appreciate the experience a lot more. The girls and boys out there playing have a much more difficult time than I do. John in one of his famous rages after an umpires call at Wimbledon in 1980 . 'When I was playing I was very serious about what I was trying to do. Often I was up against more intimidating, physical presences, so I had to get an edge through my intensity and my desire. I had to be super intense.' He's glad people like him now. 'It's been a pleasant surprise,' he says. 'I felt very misunderstood before but some of that was because I wasn't allowing people to see the whole package. Through commentating I can display a different side of my personality. I do have a sense of humour. I have more time to think about things and the way I behave.' He was particularly glad not to have been in Andy Murray's shoes just before Wimbledon last year. 'I never had as much attention as Andy gets but I think I understand what he was going through more than most. It's brilliant he broke the losing streak – and Britain finally had a Wimbledon champion. There won't be the same degree of pressure on him this year; but believe me, once you win it you want to win it again.' 'I congratulated Ivan when I saw him . because I thought it was a job well done. As much as we had . issues on the court, I think there's a mutual respect between us.' Murray was coached by John's on-and-off court rival Ivan Lendl; despite the derogatory comments traded between the two men in their heyday, he admits he admired the job Lendl did on the Scot. 'I congratulated Ivan when I saw him because I thought it was a job well done,' he says. 'As much as we had issues on the court, I think there's a mutual respect between us.' His other most famous court foe was Bjorn Borg; despite their rivalry they became friends and remain so, often meeting on the veteran pro circuit. John still plays tennis twice a week at his academy near his Manhattan home and goes to the gym three times. He's also an unlikely fan of gentle Pilates, which he does once a week. His hobby is playing the guitar and he's a keen collector of modern art. 'Artists and tennis players have a lot in common; you're out there, unarmoured, by yourself. I mainly buy; I enjoy waking up and seeing something that gives me pleasure.' Despite the list of things that still annoy him, John's clearly calmed down a little. He attributes that partly to being a father; he has five children. The eldest three, from his famously volatile first marriage to former drug-addict actress Tatum O'Neal, have all left home. But the younger two with his second wife, musician Patty Smyth – 15-year-old Ava and 18-year-old Anna – are still at home. 'My kids would tell you I still have a temper but I'm more even-keeled than I was,' he says. 'Being a father forces you to try and become steadier. If you're wildly inconsistent that's tough for kids to handle. 'It helps that I'm in a good situation with my wife; I try to be a good husband. I've had therapy and that can be helpful. My goal each year is to be one per cent better, more empathetic than I was. If I feel there's been a slight improvement then that's all the victory I need these days.' John is an Aegon Retiready brand ambassador and presents Wimbledon coverage on the BBC from Monday, see pages 16-17 for more details.","John has won everyone over with his commentary but is still not a man to be messed with .

"Simon Cowell told Lettice that she had both talent and personality . Bizarre, quirky but brilliantly entertaining, Britain's Got Talent has once again proved that no one does eccentricity quite like us. Now, after weeks of mesmerising magicians and dynamic dance troupes, hundreds of contestants have been whittled down to the last 45. So who will pick up the £250,000 prize and perform at the Royal Variety Performance? Weekend meets six of the hopefuls still in with a chance... THE HIPPY VIOLINIST . You can see why posh Lettice Rowbotham, 24, struggled with life in an orchestra. She can't keep still for a second. 'People think I'm drunk most of the time, even when I'm sober,' she says. She won a standing ovation from the judges a few weeks ago when Simon Cowell told her, 'Not only are you brilliant, but you have a fantastic personality as well.' And Lettice says that's driven her on. 'Being on BGT has given me so much encouragement. If I make it to the final I'm going to play my own stuff and really surprise people.' Surrey-born Lettice demanded a violin from her parents at the age of four after seeing buskers playing them and composed her first tune on it in a day. She won a scholarship to the prestigious Purcell School of music but left after a year. 'Musicians are very  competitive and focused while I just want to play because I love it,' she says. She moved to Greece to teach windsurfing and spent her winters in Switzerland skiing and playing her violin on the roof of a nightclub, clips of which were posted on YouTube. She claims she isn't after fame and fortune. 'I'm worried about the environment so I'd like to plant a tree for every gig I do,' she says airily. 'And I'd love to encourage kids to leave their laptops alone. Pick up an instrument instead!' THE GYRATING GRANNY . Dancer Paddy Jones, 79, says her life's been a whirlwind since her electrifying audition. In the early moments of her routine she was buzzed by Simon, but by the time her jaw-dropping performance with her Spanish dance partner Nico was over he'd repented, telling her, 'I apologise for buzzing a little early before all the crazy things happened - it went ballistic.' Amanda adored her so much she pressed the golden buzzer, sending her straight through to the semi-finals. 'It's been manic ever since,' says Paddy. 'I could do with putting a bag over my head because so many people are asking for my autograph.' Paddy was a professional dancer until . the age of 22 but gave it up to have a family. She started again a . decade ago after her husband David died of cancer 18 months after they'd . moved to Spain. Nico ran the local dance school and he and Paddy began . performing together. They've . already won one Spanish TV talent show, where she gave the Simon . Cowell-esque judge on that particular panel a piece of her mind. 'He . started having a go at Nico saying, ""What do you think you're doing . hauling that old lady around?"" So I said, ""Your mother would be ashamed . at what you're saying!""' she recalls. 'The . audience went bananas.' She and Nico then decided to  audition for BGT . in Britain. Now she's dreaming of performing at the Royal Variety, . especially if the Queen attends. 'I would die happy knowing I'd done . that,' she says with a smile. Paddy Jones, 79, shocked the audience when she performed some very daring dance moves . THE VENTRILOQUIST WITH TOURETTE'S . Sam Jones, 21, admits that ventriloquism is an odd choice of career - but it's the only thing that makes him happy. Sam, who's from Seaford in East Sussex, has suffered from Tourette's syndrome all his life. He's always come out with funny voices, and ventriloquism provides an outlet for them. 'I've always been obsessed with different characters and voices,' he says. 'What I love about ventriloquism is I can combine the two.' He taught himself from a library book when he was six, although as a keen magician too (he auditioned for BGT several years ago doing magic), ventriloquism was only a sideline at first. But it gradually took over and he now  has more than 20 puppets, although Baby Leo - with whom he auditioned on last week's show - has become his firm favourite. 'He's loveable but cheeky and mischievous. People seem to connect with him straight away,' says Sam. Sam still shows some signs of Tourette's and  hopes that he can help people be more sympathetic towards the condition. 'I was bullied at school and things felt  quite tough when I was growing up,' he says. 'But that's over now; I've learned to be proud of my Tourette's. A lot of people with Tourette's control it with creativity; they play the drums or piano. Mine has been through the puppets. You can still see it; my head moves, my eyes blink and I still tend to shout out, but I wouldn't be me without this condition.' REAformed have already earned a place in the semi-final after Alesha pressed her golden buzzer during their performance . THE GLAMOUR  GIRL GROUP . Girlie trio REAformed - Alexis Economou, 21, Renetta Eagle, 19, and Ebony Cantwell, 16 - told judge Alesha Dixon, who used to be in girl group Mis-Teeq, she was their inspiration at their audition. Alesha reciprocated  by pressing the golden buzzer. And now they're starting to think they have what it takes to be  successful. They've already had unwanted exposure when it was revealed that Alexis, from Pimlico in south-west London, was once caught smuggling drugs to a boyfriend in jail. 'That was a mistake I'm going to regret for the rest of my life,' she says. 'I know people will judge me by it but I hope they can forgive me.' All three of them come from single-parent homes and have been singing all their lives. Renetta and Ebony, who are both from Oxford, met on the local talent competition circuit. They were introduced to Alexis, who was desperate to get into a girl band, by her cousin and instantly hit it off. 'We've been together for six months now and we couldn't have asked for a better start,' says Renetta. At their audition, Simon told them to work on their harmonies if they wanted to live up to the potential Alesha saw in them. 'We've been practising like mad,' says Renetta. 'This is important for us; we want to be the next Destiny's Child.' Patsy won the audience (and Ant and Dec) over with her quick wit . THE BLUE-SKINNED DIVA . Fuzzy, pink-haired New Yorker Patsy May doesn't like to reveal her age. However, her friend (and, it has to be said, the woman behind her success) Laura Bacon from Cambridge reveals Patsy is 34. How would Patsy describe herself? 'My style is influenced by  the Muppets but I'm not affiliated to them.' Simon was so impressed with her audition he said he could see her in Amanda's chair on the judging panel next year, but like many in showbusiness she's an odd mixture of supreme confidence and crippling insecurity. The latter comes out when she wonders aloud whether she's in the show 'because I'm a token blue; I hope they haven't put me through just be-cause of my colour.' Although Patsy is a talented singer she'd quite like to find fame and fortune the easy way; by marrying into it. 'My favourite type of men are celebrities with money,' she trills. 'And they seem to like me. Did you see me on This Morning with Phillip Schofield? He went all shaky and stuttery.' She doesn't have a favourite male celebrity in mind but reveals she's already planning to drop Ant and Dec (or Anton Dec as she insists on calling them) from her act after they performed with her at her audition. 'I love them so much,' she gushes. 'But I'm going to have to move on. I hope performing with me gave their careers a much-needed boost, though.' James Smith, 15, ticked all of Simon Cowell's boxes . THE PINT-SIZED CROONER . Cute-as-a-cupcake with dimply cheeks and boyband hair, 15-year-old James Smith from Upminster in Essex surely ticks all the boxes for Simon Cowell. He sat his first GCSE the day before we meet yet he earned a standing ovation from both the audience and judges at his audition with his unbelievable rendition of Nina Simone's Feeling Good. Today he's hoping he not only does well in his exams, but can make the Britain's Got Talent final too. 'I believe I've got the potential to win it... maybe,' he says. 'The thing I'm most worried about is what Simon will say. He's the one I want to impress most. He knows everything and if he doesn't like me, I think I might just give it up.' Despite the reception he got at his audition his parents are determined to keep his feet on the ground. 'After I was on TV that first time my phone didn't stop ringing and I was looking at it constantly, so my mum took it away and told me it was all going to my head,' he shrugs. 'They're also making me work really hard on my GCSEs. If the music doesn't work out I need to be prepared to work in a bank or something boring.' With 30,000 new followers on Twitter and a school full of girls suddenly going giggly when they see him, that's looking highly unlikely.

"The mother and brother of the man nickname the 'Maimi Cannibal' said he would 'never' be capable of attacking another person and chewing his face off. Ruth Charles does not believe police accounts that her son Rudy Eugene assaulted Ronald Poppo and tore 70 percent of his face off with his teeth -- despite watching the horrifying surveillance video of the attack. Poppo, a homeless 65-year-old, survived the attack with little left of his face 'but a goatee.' Plastic surgery experts warn doctors will have to remove even more tissue before they can begin the lengthy, arduous process of rebuilding his face. Scroll down for video . Loved: The family of Rudy Eugene, 31, the . man who police say gnawed off a homeless man's face over Memorial Day . weekend, is speaking out about the man they knew and . loved, pictured as a boy . 'NEVER': Ruth Charles, Eugene's mother, refused to show her face on camera, but said her son is the victim in the cannibalism case . Ronald Poppo's daughter was shocked to learn it was her father the Miami cannibal had attacked. Janice Poppo DiBello told the NY Daily News that she was abandoned by her dad as a child. 'I’m really upset because I haven’t met my father,' the 44-year-old said. 'Since I was 2 years old, him and my . mum got divorced and there was no - like how normal divorces are, where . you see your father,' she said. 'Nobody ever heard anything . from him, so I’ve never met him. 'I didn’t know if he was alive or dead.' Poppo DiBello doesn't know whether she will travel from her home in New Jersey to Florida to visit her father in hospital. 'I’m still in shock about everything,' she said. 'It was a complete shock, because . like I said, I’ve never had a relationship with my biological father. I have never heard from him. I have no idea what . happened to him. 'Nothing ever came up, so I thought he was dead,' she said. 'I knew my son. Rudy will never, never do something like that,' Ms Charles told WPLG. 'He was a good kid. He gave me a nice . card on Mother’s Day. Everyone says he was a zombie. He was no zombie. That was my son,' she told WFOR. She, along with Eugene's girlfriend . and his brother have painted a radically different picture of the . 31-year-old than the naked man seen using his teeth to tear flesh from . another man's face for 18 minutes. Police say they were forced to shoot . Eugene multiple times after he growled at them and refused to stop . gnawing on Poppo's flesh. Ms Charles said she thinks her son was drugged and dumped along the MacArthur Causeway near Miami Beach. Confused and frightened in the 90-degree heat, Eugene only attacked Poppo after he felt threatened, Ms Charles claims. Police have a different story: They . believe he went into a rage-filled frenzy after snorting 'bath salts,' a . new synthetic drug. He walked several miles along the highway -- gradually stripping off his clothes -- after his car broke down, they say. Plastic surgery experts told ABC News . that Poppo, a New York City native who once went to a prestigious high . school and was a member of the Latin club, is still in dangerous . territory for his recovery. Fall from grace: Ronald Poppo when he was a star . student at Stuyvesant High School in New York, left, and as a . down-and-out in Florida . Lost: Mr Poppo had been living on the streets of Florida for the past 30 years, estranged from his family . They warned that human bite wounds often become infected and doctors must work now to ensure his injuries don't turn deadly. Poppo is currently in critical condition at Jackson Memorial Hospital. Once he is out of the danger zone, doctors will likely need to cut out even more of his face. Rescue: Paramedics tend to the victim, putting him on a stretcher and dressing his gruesome injuries . Still conscious: As he is transported from the walkway to the ambulance, Mr Poppo starts moving his arms around . Down: A side view shows the naked attacker shortly after he was shot dead by police . From there, doctors must begin evaluating how best to replace his eyes, nose and mouth, all of which were bitten off, along with the skin covering his face. Dr Song said surgeons could take a .

Caught: Surveillance footage shows the two naked men after the attacker was shot by police . Down: Surveillance footage shows the two naked men lying on the walkway next to the highway. Eugene is on the left and Poppo is on the right . Dr Song said Poppo might be a candidate for facial transplant, as well, but he cautioned that option is more complicate than it might seem. 'Although the face transplant patients may look good the downside is they will have to be on expensive immune suppressive medications so that his body does not reject another person's face for the rest of his life,' he said. 'The cost can be hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Someone is going to have to give him medication. He would also have to have good social support, psychiatric support.

"Yup, you could say that determined former model Jodie Kidd has put her heart and soul into trying to win tonight's Celebrity MasterChef Final. 'Oh my God!' she shrieks when she thinks about it. 'I went for it. I pushed myself so out of my comfort zone that I was out of control. And then, after two hours of cooking, I collapsed on the floor from exhaustion. Literally, fell in a heap. ' Jodie, 35, was the underdog in the show from the start. As a former waif like model who had not eaten puddings for 15 years, she only started cooking when she had son Indio nearly three years ago. Scroll down for video . Chef: Despite not eating puddings for 15 years, former model Jodie Kidd, 35, is in the Celebrity Masterchef final . Glamorous: Racing fan Jodie pictured with jockey Willie Carson at the Investec Derby last month . So she has no doubt about what got her into the final of the most prestigious of all celebrity reality shows.  'It is pure determination that got me to the final,' she says. 'I gave my heart, a hundred million percent.' That has meant practising dishes in the early hours of the morning - the only time she didn't have to film or be mummy - and then, a few hours later, cooking again in front of the cameras. 'For the first few weeks I was so insecure about the whole thing that I kept thinking to myself, 'oh my God, oh my God, why am I here? What am I doing? But slowly I started to believe in myself. I've never worked so hard but it has been the most incredible experience I have ever been through.' After the sad despatch of little perfectionist Wayne Sleep last night, the 20 original contestants have now been whittled down to three. Along with determined and competitive Jodie is her polar opposite - quiet but assured actress Sophie Thompson. And the final member of the trio to make it to the end is big meaty cooker, Alpha Male television presenter Charley Boorman. 'I didn't think I would ever get to the final but I dared to hope,' says Sophie, 52, little sister of Emma Thompson. 'It feels really special to have got this far and to have had the chance to work with so many brilliant and different people.' She says she entered because she thought it might be an adventure. And it has; all of the finalists describe it as a rollercoaster. 'One night as we watched the show years ago  one of my sons said to me, 'Ma, you should try this and I said something along the lines of, 'don't be ridiculous' only I was probably not that polite. Competition: Charley Boorman says being on the show has given him a real adrenaline rush . Fighting chance: Sophie Thompson, sister of actress Emma, is also in with a shout tonight . But somewhere in my head a wee thought piped up and whispered; actually perhaps I would like to try that. 'I feel so lucky to have been able to do it; to meet and work with such wonderful, funny, generous people. But while I knew it would be a challenge, I don't think I realised just how much of a challenge it would be.' Charley, 47, known for his thrill-seeking adventure programmes says being on the show has given him as much as of an adrenalin rush as any of his 'more stupid' - and dangerous - acts. 'Some of the challenges were brilliant fun,' he says. 'It has been a real emotional rollercoaster; from the week when I was too wildly ambitious and tried to make a meal from scratch including my own pasta to the joy of coming up with our own dishes at the Olympic park.' He says he was always quietly confident as a cook - until he started on the show. 'You quickly realise that even if you are a half decent cook your scope of food is actually quite narrow. 'Suddenly you are pushed to do things you have never done before and that's when you realise that you are not as good as you thought you were. It is a very steep learning curve and you either sink or swim.' In . tonight's show the contestants face their toughest challenge yet knowing . the stakes couldn't be higher. For their first challenge they have to . cook at top Italian restaurant L'Anima for London's Italian 'cooking . mafia' Antonio Carluccio, Giorgio Locatelli, Theo Randall and Aldo . Zilli. 'Cooking . for some of the top chefs in the land was scary,' admits Charley. 'It . was a terrifying prospect and slightly unfair. These people are the . crème de la crème of chefs and they have been cooking all their lives.' Sophie also admits she found the . challenge the most difficult yet.  'It was my hardest moment; I never . felt quite that I understood or connected to what I was making,' she . says. Battling it out: Charley Boorman, Jodie Kidd and Sophie Thompson will go head to head in tonight's final . 'I became very emotional because everybody was really helping me and wanting me to do better but I was really out of my depth. I was frustrated in myself as I had fallen so short of the excellence that was clearly required.' Even Jodie, who 'doesn't do blubbing', admits she couldn't help herself from crying like a baby after the challenge. Once she had picked herself off the floor, that is. 'I had a little blub when [Christopher] Biggins went because he is a good friend but generally I don't cry a lot. 'But in the final, when the chefs were tasting my food, I had a complete meltdown. I had given so much. I had very little left. I was a wreck.' The final challenge of the series was cooking a three course meal for the show's ever present hosts Gregg Wallace and John Torode. Jodie laughs when I bring up the duo's heart throb status, before adding 'really? They are really considered heart throbs?' But Sophie says she always enjoyed a hug with the duo. Good friends: The trio say they have enjoyed the experience, although Jodie says it was emotional at times . Terrifying: Judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace will decide which of the three goes home the winner . 'They are both, I think, so great at what they do and such enthusiasts, which is fantastically attractive,' she admits. 'I found them both very huggable.' Charley, meanwhile, admits to feeling a bit sorry for them. 'All the food they eat is cold, poor guys,' he says. 'After it is cooked it then has to be photographed and then they have to eat each dish in turn so it is always cold.' So what now for our MasterChef trio? Since the show finished filming all had a complete break from cooking. 'It was nice to just relax with some Indian takeaways and pizza for a week or so,' says Jodie. 'But now I love cooking and would love to do more of it.' Charley would quite like to incorporate it into his work as a travelogue presenter. 'And if they wanted to offer me a cookery book for Christmas, well I wouldn't say no,' he adds. While for Sophie sharing her new found knowledge will be a more private affair. 'It has really opened my head up to really using my kitchen again and celebrating and sharing the staff of life.'

"A Conservative MP has been dragged into a long-running legal dispute between one of her supporters and the founder of Fathers 4 Justice, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Caroline Nokes, MP for Romsey and Southampton North, has received a summons to appear at the High Court on Friday along with former Tory lobbyist Adrian Yalland, who is accused of harassment and assault in a civil claim. In the claim being brought by Matt O’Connor, who founded the father’s rights campaign group, and his wife Nadine, Mr Yalland is accused of assault, causing injury, unlawful trespass, breach of privacy, stalking and harassment. Caroline Nokes, MP for Romsey and Southampton North, has received a summons to appear at the High Court on Friday along with former Tory lobbyist Adrian Yalland in a civil claim brought by the Fathers 4 Justice founder . But it also names Miss Nokes as a defendant and suggests that she aided and abetted Mr Yalland. The O’Connors are seeking an injunction and compensation against the defendants. Miss Nokes and Mr Yalland last night said they would both be defending the claim, which follows an incident where Mr Yalland was held on suspicion of assault after apparently biting Matt O’Connor and his landlord in Stockbridge, Hampshire, on February 20, 2014. Mr Yalland, who was never charged with any offence, claimed he was trying to serve Mr O’Connor with a libel claim when the incident happened. Adrian Yalland (pictured) is accused of assault, causing injury, unlawful trespass, breach of privacy, stalking and harassment in claim brought to court . Court papers allege that Miss Nokes drove Mr Yalland to the O’Connors’ house, which she denies. Mr Yalland appears to have had a long-running dispute with the O’Connors. He claims he has previously sued the Fathers 4 Justice campaign director for defamation. On the day of the incident, Mr Yalland attempted to take a photograph as proof he had served his own legal papers. In an altercation that allegedly followed, Mr O’Connor said he was punched by Mr Yalland before he and the landlord were bitten. But Mr Yalland alleged the two men tried to snatch his mobile phone and said he only reacted proportionately in self-defence after being punched and pinned down. The case was dropped with police telling Mr Yalland he would face no further action. Mr Yalland described the latest allegations as ‘crazy… gross distortions or inventions’. He added: ‘I am sure the Court will conclude the same on Friday.’ Miss Nokes said last night: ‘I will be defending the claim, but I am not sure what I can do to prove a negative. 'I simply am not harassing them, and they will be unable to prove I am.’","Caroline Nokes, MP for Romsey and Southampton North, handed summons .

"'Trying to break  into the Treasury' If curiosity killed the cat, this  one is putting her nine lives on the line every day – and some suspect she’s not acting alone. George Osborne’s wandering pet Freya has sparked claims of dastardly foreign espionage tactics after breaching security at some of the Government’s most sensitive buildings. Senior figures have warned the Chancellor that his highly inquisitive feline may have developed 007-style leanings since she mysteriously reappeared in Downing Street after a curious two-year absence. The Chancellor bought the tabby as a present for his two children in 2009 when the Conservatives were still in opposition and the Osbornes were living in Notting Hill, West London. But within a few months, she went missing. Last year, having moved into Downing Street, Mr Osborne’s novelist wife Frances got an out-of-the-blue call telling her Freya had been found, apparently living as a stray and being ‘looked after’ by a ‘neighbour’. She was returned to the Osbornes thanks to a microchip under her skin carrying Mrs Osborne’s phone number. But there are some who are suspicious about Freya’s absence and wonder whether she might have been fitted with other electronic devices. ‘Some of us think the Chinese got her,’ said one Tory source. ‘She can get everywhere. You’d only have to bug her and you could find out half the Government’s secrets.’ With her ability to slip unnoticed past policemen, metal detectors and the protection squad, insiders say Freya may just be the ‘purr-fect spy’. Over the past few months, the crafty cat has been found in the most secure area of the Foreign Office, inside the  Cabinet room in Number 10 and even trying to break into the Treasury. On one occasion, she was spotted in . the command centre of a secret ‘war gaming’ exercise involving the Royal . Navy. When officials asked how she had got there, Mr Osborne’s advisers . replied: ‘She’s from the Treasury. She gets everywhere.’ On the prowl: Freya roams the streets of Whitehall . Concerns have been raised as Freya has gained access to some of the Government's most sensitive buildings . By contrast, David Cameron’s chief . mouser Larry prefers to spend his days sitting on a hot air vent next to . the famous door to Number 10. And he is unlikely to be the one to rein . in Freya since  she picked a dawn catfight with him shortly after her . return – and won. Like any good agent trying to pick up intelligence, she also likes to spend time in the bar. She can be found in Westminster’s . favourite watering hole, the Red Lion pub, on several evening a week – . despite having to cross four lanes of Whitehall traffic to get there. Barmaids regularly have  to escort her home to 11  Downing Street at the end of the evening. With a taste for the theatrical, Freya . has also had to be rescued from the dressing rooms behind the stage at . the Trafalgar Studio Theatre nearly half a mile away. As Chancellor and the Tories’ chief . political strategist, Mr Osborne knows more secrets than anyone else in . Government. ‘I said to George “are you sure she’s not a spy”,’ the . source said. ‘I mean, compared to Larry she’s certainly got a drive . about her.’ Freya is not the first political cat . to set tongues wagging. Long-term resident Humphrey mysteriously . disappeared from Number 10 shortly after Labour’s election win in 1997. Some blamed Tony Blair’s wife, Cherie, although officials insisted . Humphrey had simply retired from mousing duty due to health problems.","George Osborne's cat disappeared in 2009 but returned two years later .

"Actress Sian Phillips first turned down the role of Oscar Wilde’s imperious Lady Bracknell in The Importance Of Being Earnest 20 years ago because, aged 60 then, she thought she was too old to play the role of a 20-year-old girl’s mother. Now she has taken on the part at the age of 80 for the latest West End stage production. Nigel Havers, 62, is playing Algernon Moncrieff, who is meant to be in his late 20s, as is his friend John Worthing, played by 72-year-old Martin Jarvis. Lady Bracknell’s daughter, Gwendolen Fairfax, is played by 62-year-old Cherie Lunghi. From left, Martin Jarvis, Cherie Lunghi, Nigel Havers and Sian Philips have a combined age of 276, despite this, the cast of Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest are wowing audiences in the West End . Yes, this version of the play — described by Wilde himself as ‘a trivial comedy for serious people’ — is a little different. It has an older cast than you would traditionally see in this comedy of manners. Much older. The play is one of the most performed in British theatre. But few productions have divided critics like this one. The Mail’s Quentin Letts gave it five stars and said it made him fall in love with the play all over again. In contrast, another critic found it ‘a third-rate production . . . performed by arthritic actors’. He seemed to take particular objection to Havers’s ‘preposterously abundant hair’. Well-coiffed Nigel laughs when he thinks about how his hair has the power to offend. And then he shrugs: ‘But the whole thing was my idea, I’m afraid. I thought it was such a brilliant play that it could take doing something different with it. Not everyone agrees, but people hate change don’t they?’ Nigel fell in love with the play 32 years ago when he starred in a Peter Hall production as the charming rotter Algy — a part he feels was made for him — with Martin playing his friend, Jack. It starred Judi Dench as Lady Bracknell and was a huge success at the National Theatre. Martin Jarvis and Nigel Havers play two friends who are ordinarily in their late 20s or early 30s . Some of the backstage antics would have added to the acclaim — if the audiences had known about them. Havers suddenly appeared naked in the wings while Jarvis was on stage — causing him to explode with laughter. Jarvis, in retaliation, put Havers’s dressing room clock forward, and persuaded the staff to panic him into believing he had missed his cue. Havers and Jarvis have remained close friends and the show helped make both of them household names but they were never asked to work together again. So they decided to make it happen. ‘I saw Martin for breakfast and said: “You know how we always said we would do it again? Well let’s do it now,” recalls Nigel. ‘He said: “That’s ridiculous, we are far too old.” But then we talked about ways of making it work. ‘In my mind, these days if you are 60, it’s a bit like you were 30 a century ago. The way we age has changed. I thought that we could experiment with that and move the goal posts around.’ Martin came up with the idea of ‘framing’ the play within another. So the actors are also playing a group of amateur dramatic buffs called the Bunbury Players who are obsessed with the play. The performance of the show is depicted as their dress rehearsal. Playwright Simon Brett was brought in to write the ‘play around the play’ and Nigel gave him some hints about what old actors who love performing The Importance Of Being Earnest are like. ‘At the National, after about a month in, I winked at the audience after the first act and it got a huge laugh,’ recalls Nigel. ‘In the interval there was a bang on my dressing room door and it was Peter Hall who said: “I was watching tonight and don’t you dare do that again.” ‘So I said, “I’m so sorry,” and said I wouldn’t. But I carried on doing it, of course. It seemed the right thing to do. So I told Simon and he put it into his bit of the play.’ Then they looked around to see who else would join them: they didn’t have to look far. Martin’s wife, Rosalind Ayres, was brought in to play Miss Prism while Nigel’s long-time collaborator Christine Kavanagh takes the part of the sweet and slightly mad Cecily. For Gwendolen, Nigel immediately thought of Cherie Lunghi. The two were in the same class at the Arts Educational Theatre School in London, but had never worked together. She says: ‘Nigel and Martin explained their idea and I said, “I have a feeling it will be a terrific adventure” and it has been. The popular Oscar Wilde play is currently being performed at the Howard Pinter theatre in London . ‘Nigel is young for his age anyway; he has a sense of mischief. If I fluff on stage, he gives me this look as if to say, “Whoops-a-daisy, went wrong there, didn’t you?” which is extremely off-putting.’ Nigel laughs and then winks. She doesn’t think there is anything wrong with playing an innocent enjoying the first flush of love. ‘When I play Gwendolen, I instantly start to feel and act more girlishly. I’ve told Nigel I would like to do Romeo And Juliet next.’ She wouldn’t be the first older Juliet; Sian Phillips played her some years ago in Juliet And Her Romeo, which was based in an old people’s home. Sian agreed to play Lady Bracknell earlier this year in Washington DC, believing she could get away with it in America because there the role is often taken by men. ‘Apart from me playing the mother of a girl of 20, the production I did in America was more traditional, but both times the audience reaction has been the same,’ she says. ‘They laugh in the same places and when you reach the big denouement they shriek. It’s not us; it’s the play.’ But there are downsides to being in a play written for people 30 or 40 years younger. ‘It’s very physically demanding,’ admits Martin. He looks at Havers for confirmation. ‘Yes, this is taking it out of me a bit,’ agrees Nigel. ‘And Martin said last night: “Blimey, I feel a bit knackered. Being a 72-year-old playing a 28-year-old is very tiring.” We have to take care of ourselves a bit more than we used to. Normally, I can go all day without breakfast or lunch. I have to have them now, though, because I need all the energy I can muster.’ And then he sits down.","Sian Philips turned down the role 20 years ago because 60 was too old .

"They are the gruesome crimes that have appalled - and intrigued - the world. First came so-called Miami 'zombie', Rudy Eugene, who stripped his victim before savaging his face by the side of the road. Then, gay porn star Luka Magnotta allegedly murdered his former lover with an ice pick before dismembering him and devouring some of his flesh. As if this was not horrifying enough, he then apparently posted footage of the killing online. The pair are just the latest in a long and infamous line of cannibals whose exploits have broken one of the last taboos. Adventurer William Buehler . Seabrook wrote of his experiences with cannibalism in his 1931 book . Jungle Ways. He noted that human flesh actually tastes 'just like veal' Tribesmen in Papua New Guinea, where cannibalism is still practised . But back in the 1920s, one man set . out to provide a detailed record of the societies that devour human . flesh - and went so far as to taste it himself. American adventurer William Buehler . Seabrook wrote of his experiences in his book Jungle Ways, published in . 1931. He noted that human flesh actually tastes 'just like veal'. The account follows his travels in . West Africa, where he spent time with the Guero people, and joined them . as they feasted on human meat. The author observed that the raw flesh looked like beef but less red and with pale yellow fat. Once cooked it turned grey and smelled like beef. As for the taste, he wrote: 'It was so nearly like good, fully developed veal that I think no person . with a palate of ordinary, normal sensitiveness could distinguish it . from veal.' Modern day cannibals: Luka Magnotta (left) is . suspected of killing and eating his victim and sending body parts in the . post. Rudy Eugene (right) was shot dead while he ate the face of a . homeless man in Florida last month . Seabrook's account is regarded as . unreliable by many, because he later confessed Guero tribesmen refused . to let him take part in their tradition - bizarrely claiming he made up . for the disappointment by obtaining the body of a dead hospital patient . in France and cooking it on a spit. But experts regard his description as the most useful - because most commentaries on cannibalism come from the criminally insane and are often contradictory. German killer Armin Meiwes,insisted human flesh tastes like pork, 'but a little bit more bitter, stronger.' While Japanese cannibal Issei Sagawa described it as 'tender and soft' like tuna. The . survivors of the 1970 Andes plane crash, portrayed in the movie Alive, . were forced to eat their fellow passengers to survive - but insist in . their accounts the frozen flesh was flavourless. Cannibalism has recently been practised in several wars, specifically in Liberia and Congo. Cannibalism is rare and is not illegal in most countries. People who eat human flesh are usually charged with crimes not relating to cannibalism, such as murder or desecration of a body. The Korowai - an ethnic group of about 3,000 people in New Guinea - are one of very few tribes still believed to eat human flesh as a cultural practice. It is also still known to be practised as a ritual and in war in various Melanesian tribes. Melanesia is an island region immediately north and northeast of Australia. Survivor Nando Parrado recalled: 'When I ate my first piece, it had no taste. I forced myself to swallow - without guilt. I was eating to live.' Those . who have tried to unearth the truth about the taste of human flesh . point out the flavour is likely to vary - based on the age of the . victim, the body part eaten and the method of cooking. An article on Slate.com observed: 'Cannibals have told anthropologists that human meat is sweet, bitter, . tender, tough, and fatty. The variation may result from disparate styles . of cookery. 'Many tribes eat the meat of deceased humans only after it . has rotted slightly. Roasting and stewing seem to predominate, with many . tribes throwing in hot peppers or other seasonings. 'Rudy . Eugene, the attacker in Florida, ate his victim’s face.The Swedish . cannibal went for only the lips, while a Tokyo man reportedly cooked and . served his genitals to the highest bidders. 'Cannibalistic . tribes show a similar diversity. Seabrook’s West African cannibals . preferred the loin, rump, ribs, and palms, which were considered . especially tender. Cannibals in 19th-century Fiji reportedly preferred . the heart, thigh, and upper arm. Other tribes apparently held the . breasts of young women in high esteem.'

"On screen, Steve McQueen was the King of Cool. With his blond hair, blazing blue eyes and chiselled features, his face was more eloquent than any of the lines written for him in hit movies such as The Great Escape, Bullitt, Getaway and The Thomas Crown Affair. His tough, raw charisma appealed to male and female cinemagoers alike. He was seen as a romantic hero and an adventurer; uncompromisingly macho, yet with — his fans liked to believe — a gentle heart. No wonder he became the highest-paid movie star in the world until his death in 1980 at the age of 50, and no wonder his films live on. Scroll down for video . Steve McQueen was the world's highest paid movie star until his untimely death in 1980 aged just 50 . Away from the public eye, though, McQueen was a bully, riven with demons, deeply insecure because of a damaged childhood, paranoid, aggressive, arrogant, petty-minded, mean with money, contemptuous of women and often violent to them, and a heavy drinker and drug user. Now a TV documentary sets out to explain the upbringing that made him such a complicated man. It is produced by his son Chad, who knew him better than anyone. If McQueen’s three marriages were fraught, so were his relationships with his fellow Hollywood movers and shakers. A loner, he was well known for his rivalry with co-stars and would deliberately set out to steal scenes from them. ‘He was always worried about things being taken away from him,’ says Chad. ‘But if you look at where he came from, you can understand why.’ The tales are legendary. Appearing in The Towering Inferno in 1974 with Paul Newman, he insisted on being given 12 more lines of dialogue, so he and Newman would be equal. He also insisted that the final shot in the film belonged to him and asked the wardrobe department to have the brim of his fireman’s helmet cut back, as he didn’t want his eyes in shadow. They said if his was changed, they would have to change everyone’s. ‘Then change them,’ he said. When Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was being cast in the late Sixties, McQueen was offered the Sundance role. But when he found out that Newman — his keenest rival — had been cast as Cassidy, he insisted the title should be The Sundance Kid And Butch Cassidy, so his name came before Newman’s. His demand was turned down, and the role went to Robert Redford. Chad McQueen getting lifted into a Ford GT40 by his father who he said he idolised despite his faults . McQueen went on to demand $3 million for a brief cameo in A Bridge Too Far (1977), but received a polite refusal from director Richard Attenborough. He lost the starring role in Close Encounters Of The Third Kind because he wanted too much money, and Richard Dreyfuss stepped in. In 1979, he was offered Apocalypse Now, but would accept only if the location was moved from the Philippines to Hollywood. Martin Sheen got the role. Yet McQueen could sometimes turn his perfectionism into extra cash. Making the Thomas Crown Affair (1968), for which he was being paid $750,000, he tried on four expensive watches for one scene, but said they weren’t suitable. Instead he wore his own — and charged the producer $250 for ‘wristwatch rental’. Chad has heard them all and springs to his father’s defence. ‘People say how difficult he was, but that was because he wasn’t a sheep,’ he insists. ‘He knew what was right for him. He always did his homework and had a good idea about how he wanted to play a scene. He would fight to the death with directors to get his way, but that was how he was with everything. He lived on the edge.’ Chad idolised his father but saw how damaged he was. McQueen was the son of an alcoholic prostitute and was abandoned by both his mother and his father. Passed around family, then living on his wits on the streets, he seemed all set for a life of crime. ‘My dad had a horrible childhood,’ says Chad. ‘It made him the man he was. He fought like hell for what he believed in, but he had a very short temper; I saw that at home and in his work. He wasn’t opposed to knocking somebody out if they crossed him. ’ At 15, in trouble with the police for stealing and fighting, McQueen was sent to a reform school, the California Junior Boys Republic. ‘It was one step away from jail,’ says Chad. ‘For the first time, he felt some stability. His father had left before he was born, his mother had shunted him around, his stepfather had beaten him and he’d grown into his teens practically an orphan. When I was growing up, he never talked about his mother. ‘He always told me, “Son, Boys Republic turned my life around”. When he came out, he went into the Marines for three years, then drifted into acting.’ Chad adds: ‘If any good came out of him feeling so unwanted as a kid, it was that he always made sure me and my older sister, Terry, knew how much he loved us. He wanted to make up for what he never had.’ Steve McQueen, left, bought this Ferrari 275GTB/4 while he was filming Bullitt, the car recently sold for £6million . McQueen insisted his family came with him on long location shoots. ‘If he was our comfort blanket, we were his,’ Chad says. Chad and Terry may have been McQueen’s priority, but he made it clear that his marriage was to be conducted on his own terms. He began an affair within weeks of marrying his first wife, Neile Adams, in 1956 — and, as his career took off, he had dalliances with many others. ‘He made no secret of what was going on,’ Neile says in the documentary, ‘and I decided I would have to live with it. Once, he said: “Why do I have to work so hard for love at home when it’s free everywhere else?” ’ ‘We knew he loved the ladies,’ smiles Chad. ‘Women would hit on him constantly, even in front of Neile. He was cool about it.’ But there was one rule for McQueen and another for Neile. He became obsessively jealous, convinced she was having an affair, and held a gun to her head to make her confess. ‘He terrified me,’ Neile admits. When she admitted she’d had a romance with actor Maximilian Schell, McQueen beat her up. A few weeks later, she told McQueen she was pregnant and he made her fly to London for an abortion, saying he couldn’t be sure he was the father. The couple divorced in 1971. His next film was The Getaway, in which his co-star was Ali MacGraw. Her husband, Robert Evans, was the producer, but the pair had a torrid affair. ‘The attraction was scary,’ Ali reveals in the documentary. They married in 1973 but heaven soon turned to hell: ‘He was tremendously insecure and dangerous.’ McQueen told her she had to give up her career to look after their home — and he expected dinner at 6pm sharp every day. ‘When it was good it was very, very good, but when it was bad it was horrendous,’ she says. Steve McQueen, was diagnosed with cancer and died in November 1980, probably from breathing asbestos . She has previously told how once, on location, he went off partying with two local beauties, leaving MacGraw alone, and that night she could hear them all in the next room. In the morning, McQueen asked her to cook him breakfast and said nothing about the night before. It was typical of his attitude — he had already banned MacGraw from wearing heels and having long nails. As he once said: ‘They call me a chauvinist pig. I am and I don’t give a damn.’ ‘After five years Steve sort of checked out of the marriage,’ MacGraw says now. ‘Chad would come downstairs and find plates sailing past his head. It was a rotten family scenario.’ Steve’s stardom was consolidated with films including cult horror hit The Blob, The Magnificent Seven and The Great Escape. Yet even at the height of his fame, his insecurity surfaced. He always demanded bulk consignments of razors and jeans when he started on a movie — it was later discovered that he donated them to Boys Republic. He loved fast cars but was happiest on his motorbike and when there was a full moon — even in the middle of filming — he would vanish on it for a day or two. ‘It’s not like he was a werewolf, but it did make him go strange. Sometimes he would even bark and growl,’ laughs Chad. ‘He never explained where he went and we didn’t ask.’ After splitting with Ali, Steve grew a beard and travelled the country in a motorhome with his young model girlfriend, Barbara Minty, whom he later married, and Chad. ‘He’d had enough of fame,’ says Chad. ‘He wanted to stay at the beach; he wouldn’t let scripts be delivered to the house, so I’d have to pick them up at a gas station.’ He made only two movies in that period, and it was while filming The Hunter that he started to complain of chest pains. Doctors diagnosed cancer, probably caused by working with asbestos when he was in the Marines. He fought to the end but died on November 7, 1980. The McQueen name has lived on. Chad is an actor and also raced cars; his own son Steven is an actor in The Vampire Diaries. The legend, too, remains. ‘Thirty-four years after he died he is still well loved and respected for his work,’ says Chad. ‘My dad was proof that whatever doesn’t kill you, makes you stronger.’","Steve McQueen was the world's highest paid actor at the time of his death .

"The brothers' father, who was caught with 200 phones, was earlier cleared after prosecutors could find no evidence they were stolen . A family of Romanian pickpockets who stole from commuters to build palaces in their homeland were jailed yesterday by a judge who expressed his shock at the clan’s ‘deep-rooted criminality’. The Rostas family preyed on train passengers as they slept on late night trains going out of London, stealing hundreds of mobile phones and cash. The gipsy gang even used their children as ‘trainee pickpockets’, teaching them that theft is ‘not a serious crime’. Criminals: The thefts were carried out by the (clockwise from above left) Romulus, 18, Marin, 25, Cornell, 22  and Robert, 23, along with 17-year-old Govinder (not pictured) who was named for the first time today . The family, who were living on . benefits in Britain, pocketed hundreds of thousands of pounds by . stealing from at least 185 victims over two years, although police fear . the true number may be at least 1,000. The stolen phones were sold in Romania for huge profits. Earlier this year the Daily Mail . revealed how the gang enjoyed a life of luxury in Romania where they . built five mansions with the proceeds while they swaggered around in . designer clothing, gold jewellery and drove a fleet of luxury cars. Govinder Rostas, pictured here in 2009, was given a 12-month detention and training order . Yesterday five members of the family . were jailed for conspiracy to steal, but after an unusual plea bargain . in the middle of their trial at Blackfriars Crown Court, some could walk . free within weeks. Brothers Romulous Rostas, 18, Marin, . 25, their cousin by marriage Cornell Rostas, 22, and another cousin . Govinder, 17, changed their pleas to guilty midway through the trial . following a rare so-called ‘Goodyear’ hearing in which defence . barristers receive guidance from the judge about the sentence a . defendant would expect if he admitted his guilt. Another member of the family, Robert Rostas, 23, had earlier admitted the charges. Yesterday Cornell Rostas was jailed . for three years and three months, Marin for three years, Robert for 30 . months, Romulous for 18 months and Govinder was given a 12-month . detention and training order. Romulous will be free within five months, while Robert will serve less than a year. Judge Peter Clarke, QC, described . their racket as a ‘highly organised and regimented criminal enterprise’, . saying: ‘It’s depressing to see a family represented by so many members . showing such deep-rooted criminality.’ The court heard that Romulous, Marin, Cornell and Govinder all have previous convictions for theft.

After the hearing, Luminita Rostas, . the mother of Marin, Robert and Romulous, screamed abuse at detectives, . hammering her fists on a police officer’s chest. Marin’s wife, Andrea Ferencz, was arrested outside court for spitting at a photographer. Bad taste: The Rostas family built five gaudy mansions in their homeland financed by their racket here . The gang targeted late-night trains . running from Charing Cross to Gravesend in Kent, where the family live, . between June 2009 and August 2011. They were captured on CCTV boarding . the back of trains just before midnight, knowing that many of the . commuters would be drunk, dozing or distracted listening to music after . a  night out. They were brought to justice after British Transport Police launched an inquiry into a spike in thefts reported on the line. Police found 250 phones and 500 phone parts at the family’s homes. Mail, March 31, 2012 . David Hewitt, prosecuting, said: ‘It was a family affair. ‘They targeted vulnerable people who . were tired for various reasons, travelling home late at night. The . team’s motivation was to steal primarily mobile phones from these . people. ‘Other members of the family have been arrested for money laundering matters. ‘A not insignificant amount of money has been relocated from this country to Romania.’ Detective Constable Tim Weekes from . British Transport Police said: ‘These men are career criminals who have . all previously been arrested, charged or convicted for theft-related . matters. Mail, September 28, 2010 . ‘The items we found during house . searches, along with CCTV and mobile phone analysis, indicated that . these men were agents involved in a highly-organised conspiracy to . steal, aimed at generating as much money as possible to pass back to . other family members in Romania to buy land and property. ‘We know there were more than 180 . crimes – more than £60,000 worth of stolen property – linked to this . group, but these are minimum estimates and the true figure could have . been much higher because many thefts may have been reported as lost . property or not reported at all.’ Detectives are now investigating how huge wads of cash were transferred from Britain to Romania. Police hope to claw back the proceeds . of their crimes and last month they arrested other members of the family . on suspicion of money laundering following the Mail investigation. Mirela Rostas, Andrea Ferencz, . Luminata Rostas and Damian Rostas were held on suspicion of making . transfers of thousands of pounds to Romania to fund the family’s luxury . lifestyle. They are currently on bail. In Britain the gipsy gang lived on benefits, claiming to be homeless and destitute. Six adults and six children lived in squalor in a rundown and cramped three-bedroom terraced house in Northfleet, Kent. But earlier this year a Daily Mail investigation revealed how the Rostas family stole from hundreds of British commuters to fund a lavish lifestyle in Romania, where they built five palaces with the proceeds of their massive pickpocketing racket. The gang boasted of their riches in their homeland where they decorated their gaudy blue-roofed mansions with the Mercedes car emblem to denote their wealth. In the small town of Huedin, near Cluj in Transylvania, relatives of the clan were seen swaggering around dressed in shiny designer tracksuits and decked out in gold jewellery. Parked outside their 16-bedroom villas were Mercedes, Audis and BMWs with English and Irish number plates. The wealthy family also own two farms and recently bought another plot of land for 30,000 euros in nearby Calatele. Lavish display: The Mercedes symbols on the roof of one of their houses in Huedin, Transylvania, symbolise wealth . Dodgy: The family deliberately left windows unfinished on this five-storey building to avoid property taxes . Ostentatious: The distinctive luxury homes built by the the family - who admit to robbing sleeping commuters - tower over the town in north-west Romania . One relative said: ‘Yes, we are very, very rich family. We work in England, Spain and France. We make a lot of money.’ Police believe the family may be part of a wider organised criminal network spread across Europe, operating in Britain, Ireland, Spain and France, stealing valuable iPhone and BlackBerry handsets. Yesterday Blackfriars Crown Court was told that 17-year-old Govinder Rostas had been ‘groomed’ by his family to become a ‘trainee pickpocket’. Asking for him to be spared jail, his lawyer Rebecca Helliwell said: ‘This is how he has been brought into the world. This is his upbringing, his way of life. In his culture theft is not thought of as a serious crime.’","Brothers and cousin took cash and mobile phones from 'vulnerable' targets .

"The boarding house where Lee Harvey Oswald was staying at the time he assassinated President John F. Kennedy has gone on sale - and remains virtually untouched since that fateful day. His snug single bedroom at 1026 North Beckley in Dallas, Texas appears exactly as it did when he used an assumed name and stayed as a guest in November 1963 - bar a change of sheets. The home's owner, whose grandmother ran the boarding house 50 years ago, is selling the modest property for $500,000, and hopes it will be kept as a museum or used as a bed and breakfast. Oswald stayed in the 5-by-14 room for three weeks while working a new job at the Texas School Book Depository and he paid $8 each week for his room, the living room and refrigerator privileges. Scroll down for video . Frozen in time: Homeowner Patricia Hall holds a photograph of her grandmother, Gladys Johnson, while standing in the 5-by-14 room that Lee Harvey Oswald rented in 1963 at her family's boarding house in Dallas . Modest: CBS footage taken shortly after the assassination in 1963 shows the room where Oswald stayed . On the weekends he returned to Irving where his wife and young children lived. Owner Patricia Hall . was just 11 when Oswald lived at the house, but remembers his stay - . even though there was nothing very memorable about the man, she said. 'He was just a regular guy,' Hall told CBS News. 'My grandmother appreciated the fact that he kept his room neat and clean, that he didn't monopolize the bathroom.' After he assassinated the president, who was traveling by motorcade through the city on November 22, 1963, he reportedly ran to the home, grabbed some items and left without saying a word. When Hall's grandmother, Gladys Johnson, learned of his plot - and endured relentless door knocks from reporters and death threats in the aftermath - she scrubbed his name from the home's records. 'She was scared, humiliated,' Hall said. 'And, in . fact, she even destroyed the sign-in sheets showing that he had paid his . rent. She just wanted to erase him.' Moving on: Patricia Hall stands in front of 1026 North Beckley Avenue, which is up for sale for $500,000 . Back then: The house in 1963. Oswald had been staying there for around three weeks before his crime . Place to stay: Hall said she remembers Oswald as being a considerate boarder and an ordinary man . Hall said that her grandmother, who initially conducted interviews and posed in the sparse room for photographers, eventually refused to answer the door to reporters. But what irked her most was the police investigation, Hall said. She recounted how officers entered the home and tersely grabbed the sheets and other items before leaving. 'My grandmother harbored the fact that she never got her sheets back until the day she died,' Hall said. 'Seriously. Not because they were historic, but because those were fairly new sheets and she could have used those on other beds.' The family briefly relented to allow Oliver Stone to film scenes for his 1991 movie, JFK. Apart from the change of sheets, the small room is largely unchanged. The rest of the home also still bears fixtures and furniture that were at the home in the 1960s.

"A co-pilot who hijacked an Ethiopian Airlines plane before landing it in Geneva was in mourning for an uncle, it has been revealed. A relative of Hailemedhin Abera, 31, who seized control of Flight ET702 yesterday morning, has said Abera was in emotional distress for the past month after his uncle passed away. The news comes at the same time a harrowing account of the hijacking, from a man who claims to have been on board, was posted to social media site Reddit. Scroll down for video . Escape: A rope can be seen hanging from the window of the cockpit where the pilot fled yesterday after landing in Geneva airport after being escorted by fighter jets . Distressed: A family member of Hailemedhin Abera, 31, has said the co-pilot had been upset for the past month over the death of his uncle . Abera, who had worked for the airline for five years, locked the pilot out of the cockpit on the Rome-bound flight yesterday before diverting to Geneva, where he tried to claim asylum. According to Reddit user OK3n, Abera suddenly dropped the oxygen masks into the cabin, before threatening to turn the oxygen off. He said: 'I thought it was a simple technical glitch or somebody pressed the wrong button. Everybody looked at each other, thinking ""what’s going on?"" 'Suddenly, a deep and angry voice talked through the cabin radio: ""SIT DOWN, PUT YOUR MASKS ON, I'M CUTTING THE OXYGEN"", three times. 'At this point, I realised that the situation was serious: someone was in the pilot cabin and had hijacked the plane.' The unnamed man claims passengers then spent the next six hours wondering what was about to happen to them. In his account, he says the cabin crew handed out drinks and walked around the cabin reassuring people. When he spoke to one to ask what was going on, he was simply told that the pilot had cut communication with the crew, and that they didn't know what would happen next. He added: 'There was no sign of guards or anything in the cabin, apparently he was alone in the cockpit, locked. 'The stewardess were giving out water and saying safe words. However, you could see some of them were crying.' Reddit user OK3n has posted an account of the hijacking from inside the plane, in which he says Abera told passengers 'sit down, put your masks on, I'm cutting the oxygen' The passenger then says he was left for six hours to ponder his fate while cabin crew walked around giving out drinks and trying to keep everybody calm . He said the attendants didn't give out any information on what was happening, but could be seen crying . After six hours without any word of what was happening, the plane began circling, leaning one way then the other, at which point he was convinced they were about to crash. He said: 'I was thinking : that’s it, we’re crashing into something. Looking down to the window I see a light, two, three, I can’t see what’s ahead. 'It’s still dark. We’re going fast, we’re flying over many houses now. And suddenly, under us, the airport. Just thinking again about this moment makes me shiver. We are landing. WE, are LANDING. 'Is this true? Is this a miracle? We touched the ground, and the plane eventually stopped completely in a bit away from the plane entrance to the terminal. 'I remember crying, while most of the people were applauding.' He says they were then told about the co-pilot and warned that police would be boarding the plane shortly to evacuate them. He added: 'We were checked and accompanied very kindly by the Swiss. There were sandwiches, hot chocolate, and free wifi. 'My mother was there, we went for a walk along the Leman lake and she cooked some good meal. The psychological impact is not negligible, I'm still in a state of shock.' One of Abera's surviving uncles, Alemu Asmamaw, told the Associated Press that his nephew had been distressed over the death of another uncle. Geneva prosecutor Olivier Jornot said the co-pilot will be charged with taking hostages, a crime punishable by up to 20 years. Earlier today it was emerged that French . fighter jets had to accompany a hijacked Ethiopian Airlines plane into . Geneva airport because the Swiss air-force only work during regular . office hours. The Swiss pilots were alerted to the problem at 4.30am but are only operational in normal office hours - not before 8am. Precaution: Geneva Airport was temporarily closed when the hijacked plane landed . Unusual approach: A graphic from a tracking app showing how the plane circled over Geneva . An Ethiopian man smuggled a pistol onto a plane and hijacked a Lufthansa flight going from Frankfurt to Addis Ababa in 1993. He demanded it be flown to the U.S. because he was denied a visa. In June and April 1994, Ethiopian Airlines suffered two hijackings at the hands of passengers who demanded to be flown to Europe, according to the Aviation Safety Network, which tracks aviation hijackings and other incidents. In 1995, an Ethiopian man trying to avoid being sent back home used a knife from a food tray to commandeer an Olympic Airlines jet just before it landed in Athens, Greece. Police overpowered the hijacker with no injuries to any of the 114 people on board, according to AP reports. Also that year, five armed men seized an Ethiopian Airlines jetliner and demanded the plane be flown to Greece and then Sweden. It was instead diverted to Al Obeid, about 300 miles (480 kilometers) west of Khartoum, Sudan. In 1996 a flight from Ethiopia to Ivory Coast via Kenya was seized by hijackers who then demanded to be flown to Australia. That flight ran out fuel and crashed off the island nation of Comoros, killing 125 people, according to the Aviation Safety Network. In 2001, five military pilot trainees wrested control of a plane during a flight from Bahr Dar, in northwestern Ethiopia, to the capital Addis Ababa and demanded to be flown to Saudi Arabia. The plane didn't have enough fuel so it landed in neighboring Sudan, according to AP reports. In 2002 two passengers armed with small knives and an explosive device attempted to hijack a domestic flight but were shot and killed by in-flight security, the Aviation Safety Network reported. A Swiss airforce spokesman Laurent . Savary told AFP: 'Switzerland cannot intervene because its airbases are . closed at night and on the weekend. It's a question of budget and . staffing.' The Boeing 767-300 aircraft with 202 . passengers and crew on board had taken off from the Ethiopian capital, . Addis Ababa, and landed in Geneva at about 6am local time with just 20 . minutes of fuel remaining. The . plane circled around Geneva until the co-pilot, who had no criminal record and was declared . medically sane, heard a direct response about his requests for asylum, . it has been reported. Geneva airport chief executive Robert . Deillon told reporters that the co-pilot, . took control of the plane when the pilot left the cockpit. According to Sky News, passengers said . the pilot repeatedly demanded the co-pilot open the cockpit door but the . hijacker refused and threatened to crash the plane if the pilot carried . on. ‘The pilot went to the toilet and he (the co-pilot) locked himself in the cockpit,’ Mr Deillon said. The man 'wanted asylum in Switzerland',' he said. ‘That's the motivation of the hijacking.’ The . hijacking began over Italy, Switzerland's southern neighbour, and two . Italian fighter jets were scrambled to accompany the plane, Mr Deillon . said. The co-pilot himself . alerted authorities to the plane's hijacking, officials added - though . passengers on the plane were unaware it had been hijacked. After landing . in Geneva, the co-pilot exited the cockpit using a rope and turned . himself in to authorities. Police escorted passengers one by one, with their hands above their heads, from the taxied plane to waiting vehicles. Geneva . prosecutor Olivier Jornot said Swiss federal authorities were . investigating the hijacking and would press charges which could carry a . prison sentence of up to 20 years. Geneva airport was initially closed to other flights, but operations resumed around two hours after the hijacked plane landed. ‘We hope everything will return to normal in the afternoon,’ Mr Deillon added. The flight apparently began emitting a 'hijacking code' as it flew over Sudan and this was picked up by aviation site Airlinereporter.com. It tweeted in the early hours of Monday morning: 'Ethiopian Airlines’ Flight 702 Squawks “HiJacking” for Reasons Unknown.' It reported that this beacon, known as a '7500', cannot come from a glitch. The website said that the co-pilot kept the plane in the air over Switzerland and France until his asylum request was mentioned. Ethiopian Airlines is owned by Ethiopia's government, which has faced persistent criticism over its rights record and alleged intolerance for political dissent. Human Rights Watch says Ethiopia's human rights record 'has sharply deteriorated' over the years. The rights group says authorities severely restrict basic rights of freedom of expression, association, and assembly. The government has been accused of targeting journalists, opposition members, as well as the country's minority Muslim community.","Flight ET702 made an unscheduled landing in Geneva on Monday morning .

"Hailed a hero: Yussef Saleh al-Hotmani, agreed to guide Saif Gaddafi to safety over the Niger border, but instead directed him to an ambush in the desert . Colonel Gaddafi’s captured son Saif predicted Libya would slide back into conflict within weeks. The 39-year-old former playboy spoke out as the country unveiled its new government last night. The key job of defence minister went to an obscure army commander from Zintan – the remote mountain town where Saif was captured on Saturday. Leaders in the area had refused to hand over their trophy prisoner for trial unless they received a top post in the new cabinet. None of the cabinet positions announced last night went to prominent Islamists, which will come as a relief to David Cameron and his Western allies who helped oust Colonel Gaddafi. But the defence appointment of Osama Jueili from Zintan, a town with 16,000 inhabitants, was a major surprise. His appointment means Islamist Abdul Hakim Belhaj, the former Guantanamo Bay inmate who plans to sue MI6 over torture claims, has been cut out of the secularist government. Mr Jueili denied he won the job as a reward for catching Saif. He said: ‘It is an insult to suggest a deal was done.’ Saif remains at a secret location in custody in a private house in the town. In a ranting video message, he said that ‘in a couple of months or maximum one year’ regions that banded together to oust his family would turn on one another. He is wanted for war crimes by the International Criminal Court in The Hague, but the ICC conceded he would be tried in Libya. It means he will almost certainly face the death penalty if convicted. Tribesman Yussef Saleh al-Hotmani yesterday claimed he forsook a million euros to betray Saif. He says he was offered the cash to guide a ‘VIP’ across the remote border into Niger. Guessing who his secret client was, and fearing he would be shot rather than paid, he led Saif straight to the Zintan Brigade. Secret location: Saif Gaddafi, seated, shown in a released video with his Libyan captors. The son of former leader Muammar Gaddafi has been reportedly arguing with fighters loyal to the National Transitional Council . Injuries: The footage shows the bandages still on the thumb and two fingers of Saif's right hand - injuries that Saif claims were sustained during an allied attack . In pain: The footage shows Saif grimacing while sitting in his chair. It is unclear whether he is reactive from his injuries or his general predicament . Mr Hotmani said he had been offered . the money - the equivalent of more than 1.6million Lybian dinar - so . Saif and four companions could escape capture and possible execution at . the hands of troops loyal to the National Transitional Council. But . he said: 'I was offered millions but all the money they had would not . buy a pebble of our sand or one drop of our martyrs' blood.' It might have also been because Mr Hotmani had feared he would be killed after holding up his end of the bargain. Mr Hotmani was speaking to reporters in . Zintan, where Saif is being held at a secret location before . the details of his prosecution are finalised. The . news conference came on the same day video footage was released showing . Saif surrounded by Libyan revolutionary fighters shortly after his . capture on Saturday. The . video, allegedly taken at the Zintan safe house, shows Saif arguing . with his captors and admonishing them, saying the regions now united in . revolution would soon turn against each other rip the country apart. Mr Hotmani said he was hired as a guide to help Saif escape Libya but had instead contacted . revolutionary fighters in the country's south - informing them that a . two-car convoy carrying the wanted man would be passing near them on the . night of November 18. He said: 'I made Saif believe that I trusted him.' 'They were ready to execute me': Mr Hotmani, speaking at a news conference in Zintan, Libya, revealed he was offered one million euros to spirit Saif to safety . On the night of Saif's, Mr Hotmani said he was travelling with guards in the first car of their convoy. Ten . fighters from Zintan, in the Western mountains, and five from Hotmani's . own tribe, al-Hotman, were waiting at a pre-arranged section of the . desert. The National Transitional Council . (NTC) has appointed the local commander whose troops captured Saif Gaddafi as . the nation's new defence minister. Osama Al-Juwali, head of the military . council in Zintan, was given the defence job as part of a cabinet . line-up which has the tricky task of balancing rival regional factions . and ideological camps who are jockeying for influence. The new government line-up - which . will run the country until elections are held - was agreed at an NTC . meeting yesterday, a council source claims. But, in an indication of the tensions . around the cabinet composition, the source later said some NTC members . were not happy with the final decision. The anonymous source said: 'There are some people who do not accept some of the names.' In other appointments, Libya's . deputy envoy to the United Nations was named as foreign minister, an oil . company executive was made oil minister, and the finance minister in . the outgoing government was re-appointed, the source said. Mr Juwali is a former officer in the . Libyan military whose forces from Zintan also played a crucial role in . the offensive on Tripoli that ended Gaddafi's rule in August. He had not . previously been seen as a contender for the defence job. Mr Hotmani said: 'I had agreed with . the fighters that the best place for the ambush would be in a part of . desert that was surrounded by high ground. 'When we arrived at the dark, deep . hollow the gunfire was very precise, it only took about half a minute to . capture the first car.' He intentionally told Saif's convoy to have the vehicles spaced two miles apart to give the captors time to regroup. He said: 'When the second car arrived, we started to shoot very precisely, to damage the vehicle so he could not escape.' Saif, dressed in a long robe and a brown head scarf wrapped around his face, jumped out of the car and tried to run into the desert, but his fate was sealed. It is unclear whether Mr Hotmani had planned to ensnare Saif from the beginning, or whether he defected when he had doubts about his payment and feared that he might be killed.Mr Hotmani did admit: 'I'm sure were planning to execute me when we reached the border. They had two handguns, two grenades, a knife and handcuffs. They were ready to execute me if they had any doubt. 'I didn't ask for an advance payment or . anything. There was no money in the car. This proves that he . wanted to execute me at the border.' NTC fighters found about £3,000 in the two-car convoy. Nevertheless fighters allied to the NTC who caught Saif refer to Mr Hotmani as a 'hero'.Mr Hotmani said he believed Saif hired him as a guide because he thought he was well disguised - and that perhaps because he was delusional. Mr Hotmani said: 'Saif didn't think I knew it was him. Nobody told me it was him. Saif was dreaming of leaving Libya and then to eventually return.' The commander of the fighters that conducted the ambush, Al-Ajami Ali al-Ateri, said that on the plane after his capture, Saif had asked if it was Mr Hotmani who tipped them off. The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) said today that Libya could put Saif Gaddafi on trial at home, but that The Hague court's judges must be involved in the case.Luis Moreno-Ocampo was in Tripoli for talks with Libya's new leaders about their plans for Saif, who is charged with crimes against humanity by the ICC. Libya's new leaders want to see justice done in their own country, even though they have yet to set up a court system. Mr Moren-Ocampo said: 'Saif is captured so we are here to ensure cooperation. If they [Libyans] prosecute the case, we will discuss with them how to inform the judges, and they can do it... but our judges have to be involved.'","Former playboy, 39, speaks out as country unveils new government .

"Hundreds of thousands of mourners flooded the streets of Vietnam's capital today to bid a final farewell to legendary war hero General Vo Nguyen Giap. He is credited with leading his country to victory over the French and then the Americans. 'Long live General Vo Nguyen Giap,' people chanted, many in tears, as his flag-draped coffin passed by on a truck-drawn artillery carriage. Scroll down for video . Farewell: Vietnamese president Truong Tan Sang, left, Communist party chiefs and soldiers carry the coffin of General Vo Nguyen Giap to an artillery cart at the National Funeral House in Hanoi . People's champion: General Giap was sidelined by Communist party chiefs and later criticised the regime . Crowds of people, both young and old, lined the route, in places 10 deep, as the procession travelled along a 25-mile route from the national funeral house in Hanoi to the airport. Military legend: General Vo Nguyen Giap who died aged 102 . Giap, who died on October 4th aged 102, was revered in Vietnam only second to his mentor, former President Ho Chi Minh. Alongside the public outpouring of emotion, the government orchestrated an elaborate two-day state send-off for the general, seeking to use the moment to foster national unity at a time of discontent and economic problems. His coffin had been lying in state at the National Funeral Hall in Hanoi, draped in the national flag before soldiers in white uniforms removed the flag and carried the red coffin from the hall while other soldiers, bearing a photograph of the general went ahead of them. The coffin was then placed on a gun carriage, the flag replaced, and a glass canopy lifted on top of it. Gen Giap's family, wearing black, stood nearby as the procession began. After the war, Giap was sidelined by the Communist Party, and toward the end of his life emerged as something of a critic, shielded from consequence because of his popularity. State-controlled media has eulogised him since his death, but neglected to mention that chapter of his life. Hero: Soldiers carry a portrait of General Vo Nguyen Giap during the funeral procession in Hanoi . Send-off: Soldiers place the coffin of  General Vo Nguyen Giap on an artillery cart at the National Funeral House . Gun carriage salute: Soldiers place the glass cover on the general's coffin . Ritual: Soldiers prepare incenses before the general's funeral procession. He was credited with masterminding the deafeat of the French and the U.S. 'You, . comrade, have made a great and excellent contribution to the . revolutionary cause of our party and nation,' Communist Party chief . Nguyen Phu Trong said at the funeral house. 'Your personality and your great contribution were strongly imprinted in the heart of the people.' Following the state ceremony, Giap's body was . flown to his home province of Quang Binh in central Vietnam, with . hundreds of thousands of people lining the 43-mile route from the . airport to his burial site. Many held portraits, saying they wanted to bid the general farewell.

'It is our greatest happiness to be close to him,' he said. The ceremony was attended by President Truong Tan Sang and other top officials and broadcast live on state television. Giap was buried in Quang Binh instead . of the Mai Dich cemetery in Hanoi, where most high-ranking Vietnamese . officials are traditionally buried, in accordance with his and his . family's wishes. He is best remembered for leading Vietnamese forces to victory over the French at Dien Bien Phu in 1954. People hold up portraits of Vietnamese late Gen.

Flower power: Mourners hold flowers and pictures of the general as they gather at his burial site . In line: Scores of soldiers walk to the burial site in the general's home province . His Chinese advisers told him to . strike elite French forces fast and hard, but Giap changed plans at the . last minute and ordered his jungle troops, clad in sandals made of old . car tires, to besiege the French army. The . French were defeated after 56 days, and the unlikely victory led not . only to Vietnam's independence, but hastened the collapse of colonialism . across Indochina and beyond. 'No words can describe how much love and respect people reserve for Gen. Giap,"" 71-year-old Nguyen Thi Vi, from the central province of Ha Tinh, said as she waited in the crowd in Hanoi .

"Egyptians voted narrowly in favour of a controversial new constitution yesterday amid accusations of widespread ballot box violations. Rights groups today called for a repeat of the first round of the two-part referendum as Islamists, who back the disputed charter, claimed they were in the lead with a 56 per cent majority of ‘yes’ votes. Representatives of the seven groups charged that there was insufficient supervision by judges in Saturday's vote in 10 of Egypt's 27 provinces and independent monitors were prevented from witnessing vote counts. Count: Polling station officials count ballots at a polling station in Cairo, but rights groups have demanded a repeat of the first round . Controversial constitution: Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi, left, casts his vote on the disputed constitution that has polarized the nation . Opposition: Rival camps fear the constitution will divide the Arab world's biggest nation . The representatives told a news conference that they had reports of individuals falsely identifying themselves as judges, of women prevented from voting and that members of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood were allowed inside polling stations. They also complained that some polling centers closed earlier than scheduled and that Christians were denied entry to polling stations. ‘The vote counting took place in darkness,’ Negad Borai, the head of one of the groups, said. Next week’s second round is likely to give another ‘yes’ vote as it includes districts seen as more sympathetic towards Islamist President Mohammed Morsi’s Muslim Brotherhood - meaning the constitution would be approved. But a close win would give President Morsi only limited cause for celebration by showing the wide rifts in a country where he needs to build consensus on tough economic reforms. Mr Morsi and his backers say the constitution is vital to move Egypt’s democratic transition forward. Referendum: Polling station officials count ballots at a polling station in Cairo . On guard: Meanwhile Egyptian riot police cordon off all access to the road leading to the police station in Cairo's Doqqi neighbourhood . Tensions: Egyptian riot police walk past a military tank guarding the presidential palace in Cairo . But opponents say the basic law is too Islamist and tramples on minority rights, including those of Christians who make up 10 percent of the population. Deadly protests erupted ahead of the vote after Mr Morsi awarded himself extra powers on last month and then fast-tracked the constitution through an assembly dominated by his Islamist allies. Official results are not expected till after the next round. Unrest: A protester looks at graffiti on cement blocks in front of the presidential palace in Cairo . Concern: Barbed wire has been set up in Tahir Square, the focal point of the Egyptian uprising . Protest: Police walk past a  banner with a defaced photo of the Muslim Brotherhood's supreme guide, Mohamed Badie . The vote capped a near two-year struggle over Egypt's identity since the ouster of longtime leader Hosni Mubarak. The latest crisis over the charter evolved into a fight over whether Egypt should move toward a religious state under Morsi's Brotherhood and their ultraconservative Salafi allies, or one that retains secular traditions and an Islamic character. Underlining the tension, some 120,000 army troops were deployed to help the police protect polling stations and state institutions after clashes between Morsi's supporters and opponents over the past three weeks left at least 10 people dead and about 1,000 wounded. Military operation: Some 120,000 army troops have been deployed to help the police protect polling stations and state institutions . Residents: A total of ten of Egypt's 27 provinces took part in yesterday's referendum, while the rest will take part next week .","Muslim Brotherhood claims to be in lead with 56 per cent of 'yes' votes .

"Ferris wheel will measure nearly 300ft in height . Construction had to be stopped earlier this year over safety concerns . Originally intended to open to the public in June but will now open in October . China is close to completing construction of what will become the world’s largest spoke free Ferris wheel at nearly 300ft high. The shi lai yun zhuan,’ which means ‘turn of fortune’ Ferris wheel, currently under construction in the eastern China measures 89 metres (292ft) in height and has a diameter of 84 metres as well as weighing in at a whopping 3000 tonnes. Construction work on the Ferris wheel began in 2009 at a cost of $23.8million (£15.5million) but it has been dogged by delays including a six month lay off earlier this year while safety checks were carried out. Scroll down for video . World first: China has built the first spokeless ferris wheel measuring nearly 300 feet in height and weighing 89 tones. The wheel is being built in an . effort to boost tourism to the area. When complete . it will hold 24 cars each seating 5 people, according to Changzhou city’s . English language tourism website. The website says the Ferris wheel . will have a speed of 16.4 degrees per second, the outer ring turning 0.2 . m per second, so a round trip takes about 22 minutes. Currently, the largest Ferris wheel in the world is located in Singapore, which is 165 meters tall. Construction . of the Ferris wheel has not been without controversy however. The . Yangtze Evening Post reported in March that construction work had only just resumed after being suspended for six months while safety checks were carried out. Authorities were reported to be concerned following reports that . exposure to the elements had left parts of the wheel prone to rust. Spokeless wheels although striking in . appearance, have several practical disadvantages that have prevented their widespread use as an alternative to conventional wheels. Wheee . They are often difficult and . expensive to manufacture, requiring a great deal of precision machining, . and the design leaves the bearings and other mechanical parts largely . exposed to the elements. The drive system is especially . problematic since a conventional axle and CV joint cannot be used; . options include using chain or belt drive. Another option is to house . the entire propulsion system inside the wheel itself. Work on the Ferris wheel only started again after it . passed a safety assessment from the General Administration of Quality . Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, the newspaper reported. At the time an official with the . Changzhou Gardening and Landscape Architecture Bureau who gave his name . only as Tao denied construction had been suspended. ‘Workers have been making the . components of the Ferris wheel in factories, so there are few workers at . the construction site,’ he told them English language Chinese newspaper . Global Times. ‘By the end of next month, the construction workers will be back to finish the rest of the work.’ Nearly complete: the ferris wheel was due to open this month but has been delayed after a six month hiatus in construction earlier this year. He added the assessment and approval process for the spokeless wheel had hindered construction. ‘Authorities approved an . entertainment facility, but due to the complicated nature of this . structure, authorities thought it was necessary to reassess the . project,’ Tao said. Tao also predicted the spokeless . Ferris wheel would bring considerable revenue to the park and will cover . the $23million construction cost. China already has a poor safety record. Last summer a motorway bridge in Heilongjiang province in north east China collapsed sending four huge trucks crashing 100ft to the ground below and killing three people. The tragedy came just ten months after the multimillion pound roadway was constructed and was one of two transport disasters to hit the province this week, with a train crash at a railway station on Thursday also injuring at least 24 people. Among the top 10 highest Ferris . wheels in the world, seven of them are in China. The highest Ferris . wheel in the world is the Singapore Flyer at 165 metres (541ft) tall. The largest spokeless wheel is ""The Big O"" in Tokyo . which is around 60 meters (196ft) tall. The ‘turn of fortune’ will almost be 24 . meters taller. As China's Spokeless Wheel is almost . completing construction, New York is also sketching out an ambitious . plan of building a huge Ferris wheel on Staten Island. Russia is also reportedly considering construction of its own spokeless Ferris wheel with a moving rail or chain design. In March it published designs for a 722ft tall Ferris wheel to be built in the capital. Tentatively named Moscow View it will top the Singapore Flyer and the 443ft London Eye. Designed by US-based architecture firm Gensler, the Moscow View will be part of a larger complex with restaurants, shopping, galleries, and theatres in the base, that's expected to cost in the neighborhood of $300million.","Ferris wheel will measure nearly 300ft in height .

"A physicist's marriage proposal has gone viral after he asked his girlfriend to marry him by presenting her with a scientific paper on their relationship. The proposal from Australian physicist Brendan McMonigal comes in the form of a heart-warming mock academic study entitled 'Two Body Interactions: A Longitudinal Study'. The scientist explains the stages of the couple's relationship from their initial meeting at the University of Sydney seven years ago to the section titled 'Conclusions' offering Christie Nelan a Yes/No box to tick. A couple with chemistry: Brendan McMonigal's proposal to fellow physicist Christie Nelan went viral when she posted it online on Sunday . Physical attraction: The happy couple, pictured, will be married in May this year following Brendan McMonigal's unusual proposal . 'The summary of the findings of the study are presented in Figure 1 and that that the project happiness is upward with high confidence,' it says. 'Taking these results into account, the author proposes to Christie the indefinite continuation of the study. The subjects response to their proposal should be indicated below.' The paper features a 'happiness graph' and is littered with somewhat unromantic scientific terms such as 'optimal conditions' and 'high level of compatibility'. But luckily for Brendan his girlfriend, also a scientist, saw the funny side and loved his geeky proposal so decided to tick the 'Yes' box. Brendan proposed back in March 2012 but the couple are due to marry in May this year. Speaking to the University of Sydney website yesterday Brendan said: 'I wanted to do it in a unique way that would be special to us. 'I had asked her to read over 'a paper I had been having trouble understanding' a few days earlier, and after I lured her to the spot we were standing when we met, I got down on one knee to get the paper out of my bag and hand it to her, then I just stood up and waited.' Successful experiment: Physicists Brendan McMonigal and Christie Nelan, pictured, will get married in May this year after McMonigal proposed with a scientific paper . Positive reaction: Brendan McMonigal, left, proposed to Christie Nelan, right, with an academic paper. She said 'Yes' despite his unorthodox approach . Campus romance: Brendan McMonigal and Christie Nelan met while both studying physics at the University of Sydney, pictured . 'She didn't notice what was happening at all, but, as a typical physics grad, she read the abstract then skipped straight to the conclusion and quickly realized!' Christie posted the proposal to Reddit on Sunday and it has since spread like wildfire across the internet being read by thousands. The paper talks through the couple's relationship from their initial meeting. As it explains: 'This meeting would have been a fleeting interaction as so many two body interactions are, but a high level of compatibility coupled with a high rate of interaction due to similar timetables resulted in a local resonance and eventually a semi-bound state.' 'Over the course of this phase of the study, the locational dependence of the results was tested across two main long term locations as well as a multitude of short term locations local, interstate, and international.' 'Additional tests included a two week separation and a surprise (Project Valentine),' it adds. If at times the scientific proposal is hard to follow for the lay reader it made perfect sense to the two academics. The pair met in University where they both studied physics, Brendan majoring in Maths, Physics, Linguistics and Philosophy and Christie in Physics and Ancient Greek. Brendan is currently a PhD student working on 'galactic evolution' with a special interest in 'General Relativity' while Christie works with the Questacon Science Squad - a schools science program for children across Australia . Thousands have read the proposal online and more than one thousand joined in the fun, assessing the paper for its scientific merits. Others urged writers of The Big Bang Theory to adopt the proposal technique for its central character Sheldon Cooper. 'No control group, inadequate sample size, and unwarranted assumptions about future conditions ... but yeah, congratulations,' one Reddit user wrote. 'While innovative and emotionally appealing, the submitted paper fails to cite any of its sources and skims over its methodology,"" another added. 'As such, I cannot in good conscience recommend it for publication.' 'Has it been Peer-reviewed? If not, the results could be bogus. But seriously: congratulations :),' said another, while one fellow scientist added her appreciation: 'As a scientist and a lady, this is the cutest thing I've ever seen.

"The sister and niece of U.S. comedian Sarah Silverman have been detained in Jerusalem's Old City for wearing prayer shawls that tradition dictates are to be worn only by Orthodox Jewish men. Rabbi Susan Silverman and 17-year-old Hallel Silverman were among ten people detained at the Western Wall, one of the holiest sites in all of Judaism. Susan is from the Reform stream of Judaism and belong to ‘Women of the Wall,’ a liberal group that goes to the sacred site every month to worship and protest inequality for women in the religion. Women of the Wall: Susan Silverman, left, and her 17-year-old daughter, Hallel, were detained Monday at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem for wearing prayer shawls for Orthodox men . Detained: Wrapped in Jewish prayer shawls, Rabbi Susan Silverman, second left, Hallel, second right, are detained by police officers in Jerusalem's Old City . Defiance: Several women, including Hallel Silverman, sit down on the pavement in defiance of police attempting to make arrests . However, the Wailing Wall operates under the deeply conservative Orthodox ritual law and bars women from wearing prayer shawls, called tallits, or publically reading from the scriptures. Outspoken: Sarah Silverman, pictured Saturday at the BAFTA awards, tweeted her support for her sister's 'civil disobedience' She told the New York Daily News from Jerusalem that was ‘proud to take a stand for something I believe in,’ adding that there is a great inequality at the Jewish holy site, calling the rules banning women from wearing shawls and reading the Torah are ‘outdated.’ Sarah Silverman wrote on her Twitter page that she was 'SO proud' of her sister and niece for their 'civil disobedience,’ as well as more crass language typical of the outspoken comedian. Her niece Hallel cheekily tweeted back: ‘hey auntie, want a copy of my mugshot?’ She later said that the authorities ‘let us out after four hours or so,’ and that being detained ‘wasn’t too bad.’ The women were also banned from visiting the Wall for a fortnight. According to the Jerusalem Post, around 150 women and a few dozen men attended the monthly ceremony. Though guards confiscate any tallit from women entering the Wall at a security checkpoint, prayer shawls were smuggled in by men who supported the women’s cause. Susan Silverman told Haaretz in a 2010 profile that her sister’s dirty humor had something of a holy purpose, much like her own religious protests. ‘Sarah’s really calling out the ills of society. She’s saying: I’m not interested in your rituals, in what you pray and what you say. ‘I’m interested in the fact that we live in this really racist society, that we live in this really violent world. She’s interested in the things that God actually is interested in.’ Anat Hoffman, the founder of ‘Women of the Wall’ and one of the ten detained, told the Associated Press that they were stopped because of their choice of wardrobe. Ever eloquent: Silverman wrote that she was 'so proud' of her sister and niece, but also included some signature vulgarity . Detained: Israeli police arrest Rabbi Susan Silverman, left, sister of comedian Sarah Silverman, and her teenage daughter Hallel, center, after performing Rosh Hodesh prayers . Escorted: The mother and daughter were escorted out of the premises by Israeli police and were detained for several hours . The group conducts certain rituals, such as wearing prayer shawls and skullcaps and singing out loud, practices reserved for men under strict Orthodox interpretations of Judaism. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the women were detained because they acted against court-ordered regulations that bar women from wearing prayer shawls at the Western Wall so as not to offend Orthodox Jewish worshippers. The group has been gathering at the Western Wall for a quarter century, but in recent years its activists have been increasingly detained by police. Ms Hoffman, who chairs the group, said no woman detained has ever been formally charged with any crime. 'This is just attrition,' said Ms Hoffman. 'They want to the group to become frightened.' Comfort: Silverman hugs her daughter after her arrest; the prayer was organized by the Women of Wall, a group which calls for rights of women to pray at Judaism's holiest site without restriction . Beliefs: Police warned the women wearing prayer shawls and made 10 arrests as the women left the morning prayers session. Orthodox Jews traditionally believe that prayer shawls should only be should only be worn by men . The Monday detentions took place after about 300 people gathered at a prayer service at the Western Wall to protest Orthodox control of the site. Among the worshippers in the group, Ms Hoffman said, were about 100 male supporters, including veterans from the legendary Israeli paratroopers' battalion that captured Jerusalem's ancient walled Old City, including the Western Wall, in the 1967 Middle East War. In December, after Ms Hoffman was arrested under similar circumstances, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the head of the semi-governmental Jewish Agency to come up with solutions that would allow for non-Orthodox women to pray freely at the site. Ms Hoffman said two of the women held by police were American rabbis from the egalitarian Conservative Jewish movement who missed a scheduled meeting with the Jewish Agency chief to discuss the very issue that landed them in police custody.","Rabbi Susan Silverman and her daughter Hallel were detained at Jerusalem's Wailing Wall on Monday for wearing prayer shawls .

"Mystery: Sara Al Amoudi has won her battle after being sued for £14million by two London property developers . A mysterious ‘vamp in a veil’ who allegedly duped a couple out of flats worth £14million has been told she can keep the properties. The identity of the woman is still unclear and even the judge that ruled in her favour remains in the dark. Named as Sara Al-Amoudi in court, she was accused of being a penniless Ethiopian prostitute posing as an Arabian princess with limitless wealth. It was even suggested to the court that the woman, said to be between 30 and 43, was the secret fifth wife of 89-year-old King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, one of the richest men on earth. London property developers Amanda Clutterbuck and Ian Paton claimed they temporarily signed six flats in Knightsbridge over to Miss Al-Amoudi, but that no payment was forthcoming. In court they demanded the value of the apartments back. Their barrister Stuart Cakebread had described Miss Al-Amoudi’s case as ‘a farrago of lies’ and ‘the most preposterous nonsense’ and ridiculed her ‘absurd performance where she pretends to be a Saudi princess’. But a judge at London’s High Court has ruled that the couple were not tricked – and that mother-of-one Miss Al-Amoudi is the flats’ rightful owner. Mrs Justice Asplin accepted Miss Al-Amoudi’s claim that she was having a secret affair with Mr Paton, 45, behind the back of his long-term girlfriend, 56-year-old Miss Clutterbuck, and that the flats were repayment for millions she lent him. While Miss Al-Amoudi denied presenting herself as a princess as part of the scam, the judge noted that she has bodyguards and ‘travels in a black Range Rover, part of the registration number of which is “HRH”’. ‘Her evidence in relation to the registration number was that it was coincidence and then sought to deny knowledge of it,’ the judge said. ‘I found her evidence in this regard to be highly implausible and I reject it.’ But she added that it was ‘unnecessary to determine’ whether or not Miss Al-Amoudi was an imposter. Ms Al Amoudi maintained throughout a month-long High Court hearing that she was the runaway daughter of a billionaire Saudi sheik . Ms Al Amoudi, whose age is thought to be between 31 and 45, arrives at court ahead of the decision . She insisted she had received 'millions of pounds in suitcases' from her mother, whilst facing claims that she was in fact 'a penniless prostitute from the Yemen' masquerading as royalty . In court the mysterious woman made much play of her adherence to the . rules of Islam – even having to be persuaded to remove her veil. But the Daily Mail uncovered photographs of her in a London nightclub wearing a silky bodice and displaying her cleavage. A . previous criminal trial also heard claims that her un-Islamic . activities included swilling champagne and snorting cocaine and the . horse tranquilliser ketamine. Sara Al Amoudi dubbed the 'Vamp in the veil' was accused of being a one-time penniless Ethiopian prostitute who posed as a princess to swindle London property developers Amanda Clutterbuck, right, and Ian Paton, left, out of luxury flats worth £14million . Sara al Amoudi's property portfolio includes a flat in Hans Crescent,  Knightsbridge . Miss Al-Amoudi owns 13 apartments in exclusive London areas including Knightsbridge and Chelsea . The dispute over flats began during . the property boom at the start of the Millennium, when Mr Clutterbuck . and Mr Paton sought properties in Knightsbridge close to Harrods to . develop. They said Miss Al-Amoudi was introduced as a Saudi princess . whose family had ‘limitless wealth’, and they worked with her for years . towards a huge development. When they needed investment, they . said, she claimed to have access to £46million through an Islamic . ‘sharia loan’, but needed the six flats as securities to get the cash. She . then kept the apartments, they alleged, but no loan or development ever . materialised. Miss Al-Amoudi argued that she was ‘naïve and vulnerable’ and had a long affair with Mr Paton, but that it fell apart when his . debts to her reached £5million and she discovered he was a drug user. She claimed she never entered into business schemes with the two developers and vehemently denied being a prostitute. Above, from left: Maha Al-Mutawakel-Ramsden, a less-modestly dressed Sara Al Amoudi, former table dancer Diana Langer and Samera 'Amani' Al-Mutawakel, pictured at a Mayfair nightclub . Despite . finding for Miss Al-Amoudi, the judge said of her: ‘The majority of her . evidence was given in a highly emotional manner which verged on the . hysterical and barely made any sense. In cross-examination she was . reluctant to confirm whether she had been married to a member of the . Saudi royal family.’ Mrs Justice Asplin dismissed claims from . witness Negat Ali, an Ethiopian living in south London, that she knew . Miss Al-Amoudi as a prostitute in Dubai 25 years ago. Her evidence was . not accepted among claims she was paid to lie.

"Former Cuban president Fidel Castro's 88th birthday is being celebrated all over Cuba - but with there having been a rumoured 600-plus attempts of his life it is a miracle he has made it this far. His birthday is today, and it is being recognised with tributes in official media, a concert and a photo exhibit in the capital Havana and a newly inaugurated restoration of the home where he was born. Communist leader Castro is loathed by many exiles in Florida who say he ruled with an iron fist and stamped out civil liberties. He was celebrated on  Wednesday Island as a fighter for equality and social justice who defied the U.S. for five decades. A girl attends an exhibition of photographs of Fidel Castro by photographer Roberto Chile at the Jose Marti Memorial in Havana, Cuba. Castro celebrates his 88th birthday today . A concert of Cuban duet Buena Fe marks part of the celebration of Youth Day on the eve of the birthday of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro who has had a rumoured 638 attempts on his life . He ruled in Cuba from 1959 to 2008, when he retired following a near-fatal illness, ceding power to his younger brother Raul. Fabian Escalante, who protected Castro during his 49 years in power, claims that there were 638 CIA plots to assassinate him, ranging from an exploding cigar to a poisonous fountain pen, mostly during the first half of the 1960s. Some of these attempts were part of Operation Mongoose - a plan which aimed to take down the Cuban government. Castro made his first public appearance in months when he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin . An image of Fidel Castro painted by children with motifs of the revolution and scribbled with happy birthday messages at the Jose Marti Memorial . A child looks nervously at a photograph of the former Communist leader at the Havana photo exhibition . Some of the assassination plots were aired on Channel 4 in 2006, in a documentary called '638 Ways to Kill Castro'. One of the most famous came when the CIA hired his ex-mistress Marita Lorenz to feed him poisoned capsules. However, Castro found out about the attempt, and allegedly handed her a gun and told her to shoot him, which she said she could not. The concert to celebrate Castro's remarkable 88 years took place last night, and featured Cuban duet Buena Fe. The photographs at the exhibition were taken by Roberto Chile and were displayed at the Jose Marti Memorial. Meanwhile, an article in Communist Party newspaper Granma said 'paying homage to Fidel is a great party'. Earlier this year, a new book on the hidden life of  the Cuban leader claimed he lived in luxury on his own private island, which included a turtle farm. It was thought that Castro lived a simple, austere life similar to his fellow Cubans in the communist country. However, in the  book La Vie Cachée de Fidel Castro (Fidel Castro's Hidden Life), a former bodyguard says Castro never renounced 'capitalist comforts'. Juan Reinaldo Sánchez, who worked for the leader for 17 years and now lives in America, says that the vast majority of his countrymen weren't aware of their leader's lavish lifestyle, which is in stark comparison to normal Cubans. He claims that Castro had a private island, Cayo Piedra, south of the Bay of Pigs, describing it as a 'Garden of Eden', complete with a turtles and dolphin farm. Castro rarely appears in public these days, and in recent years has not taken part in official celebrations of his birthday.","Concert and art exhibition mark the communist leader's birthday .

"Australian golfer Robert Allenby has recalled his terrifying ordeal after he was kidnapped, beaten and robbed in Honolulu on Friday night, saying he feels lucky to be alive. Allenby was at the popular Amuse Wine Bar in the tourist-laden Waikiki with his close friend Anthony Puntoriero after missing the cut at the Sony Open. The 43-year-old believes the suspects may have drugged him before he was taken to an underground car park where he was knocked out, robbed and thrown into the boot of a car. Allenby has noticeable damage and lacerations to his nose and forehead. 'I didn't think I was going to survive this one,' Allenby told AAP. Scroll down for video . Australian golfer Robert Allenby was allegedly kidnapped from a bar, robbed and beaten up in Hawaii . Allenby, 43, was in the country playing the Sony Open, seen here taking a shot from the 17th tee in the second round of the competition . The golfer was drinking at Amuse Wine Bar about 8 kilometres (5.4 miles) from his hotel when he was kidnapped . 'I was separated from my friend in the bar after we had paid the tab at 10:48pm and he went to the bathroom and next thing you know I'm being dumped in a park miles away. 'I only know this part because a homeless woman found me and told me she saw a few guys pull up and throw me out of the car. That is where I got the scrapes above my eye from the sidewalk.' Shaken and in a bad way Allenby realised he was without his phone, wallet or any cash and was starting to be harassed by other homeless people in the park. 'The homeless woman got me away from the others and then a retired military guy walking past came to my aid,' he said. The Sony Open was held at the Waialae Country Club and Allenby was staying at the nearby Kahala Hotel . The Australian failed to make the cut after the first two days of play . 'He got me into a taxi and paid for me to get to my hotel and I called police from there. I have his details and will be getting back in touch with him for sure.' Born: 12 July, 1971 . Turned pro: 1992 . Joined PGA Tour: 1999 . Best major results: Equal seventh, U.S. Open (2004), The Open Championship (2008) Best Australian PGA result:2005 'triple crown', winning the Australian Masters, Open and PGA . Earnings: Allenby is 27th on the all-time list for the PGA Tour with $27,329,892 . The four-time PGA Tour winner has been assisting police and PGA Tour FBI officials with inquiries. 'We have some names and numbers and they have some leads to follow up, so I am confident they will get the guys,' Allenby said. 'With the FBI guys involved, they're the best, the guys on the tour are awesome, and they'll get to the bottom of it.' Allenby was most concerned about potentially not being able to call 13-year-old daughter Lily for her birthday, but scans have cleared him of any serious facial or head injuries and he is hopeful of being cleared to fly in the next day or two. 'She's really upset about it but at the end of the day it could have been a lot worse,' the Victorian said. The 43-year-old had been drinking with caddy Mick Middlemo and friend Anthony Punteriero . Allenby is the fourth-highest Australian money earner in the PGA Tour . Allenby was set to head back to the US on Saturday morning, but has stayed on to assist police with their investigations . 'I don't care about the money or my cards or anything like that. I am just glad I have survived this one.' Caddy Mick Maddlemo had been with Allenby earlier in the evening . According to The Golf Channel reporter Steve Sands who originally broke the story, Allenby was put into a car, woke up in a park 'groggy' and with no recollection of the events, before he was found by a retired military individual. The Australian golfer was then returned to the Kahala Hotel where he had spent the week while playing at the Sony Open held at the nearby Waialae Country Club - where Allenby failed to make the cut after the first two days of play. His friend Anthony Puntoriero - who was with Allenby earlier on the night - confirmed he was kidnapped. 'He's all right now but we are still talking to detectives,' Puntoriero told AAP. Puntoriero and Allenby's caddy were not with the four-time PGA Tour winner at the moment of the abduction. Allenby was set to head back to the US on Saturday morning, but has stayed on to assist police with their investigations. He reportedly managed to piece together some of the night after being reunited with Puntoriero and his caddy, and CCTV footage from the wine bar is being reviewed in an attempt to identify the perpetrators. The 43-year-old has been a professional golfer since 1992, and while a consistent performer on the PGA Tour for 15 years he has never won a major tournament. The golfer's friend Anthony Puntoriero, who was with him earlier in the night, confirmed he was kidnapped . This is the 17th time the Sony Open has been held at Waialae Country Club . Allenby's best result on at PGA Tour major was to finish equal seventh - which he achieved twice - at the 2004 U.S. Open and the 2008 Open Championship. He won Australia's 'triple crown' in 2005 - winning the Masters, Australian PGA and Australian Open. He's also been a regular in the Presidents Cup, representing the International team five times between 1993 and 2009. Allenby sits at 27th on the all-time list for the PGA Tour with $27,329,892 which makes him the fourth highest Australian money earner, behind Adam Scott (10th - $37.4m), Stuart Appleby (20th - $28.8m) and Geoff Ogilvy (21st - $28.5m). The Melbourne-born golfer now lives in the U.S. full time, in Jupiter, Florida.","Robert Allenby was allegedly kidnapped in Honolulu, Hawaii .

"Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal admitted he liked the way QPR played in defeat to his side at Loftus Road on Saturday. However, mistakenly calling Harry Redknapp's side 'Queens Park Raisins' in a post-match interview with Sky Sports slightly tarnished the Dutchman's sentiments. The Hoops’ ‘currant’ run of form sees them without a win in their previous five Premier League games.

"CLICK HERE to read Martin Samuel's match report of Arsenal's impressive victory at the Etihad Stadium. One of the many reasons for Arsenal's lean years in the Barclays Premier League is their failure to do well against the really big teams. As such, this impressive victory at the Etihad Stadium was one to buck a miserable trend. Prior to Sunday, Arsene Wenger's team had not beaten Manchester City in the league since April 2012. They have not overcome Chelsea since October 2011 while, in terms of Manchester United, they have won only once since November 2008. French striker Olivier Giroud celebrates heading in Arsenal's second at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday . Cazorla leads the Arsenal celebrations after the Spaniard kept his cool to fire home from the penalty spot . It is an astonishing record and says everything for the manner in which Arsenal have declined under Wenger over the last decade. Equally, however, it's a run of results that helps to put this one in to context. This was, in truth, as admirable as it was unexpected. Here in wintery Manchester, Arsenal managed to produce a performance that contained much of what we expect from them and, crucially, some elements that we no longer do. Wenger's team were as inventive in possession as ever. Santi Cazorla was the game's best player and, arguably, its most hard working. Equally, Arsenal were rapid on the counter attack. Giroud slides in jubilant celebration with Arsenal team-mate Alexis Sanchez on the way to three vital points . Here, though, we also witnessed a performance of tactical shrewdness – especially in the first-half – as well as some stout defending and a well-taken goal from a set piece. These are things that we don't always see from a team that doesn't always seem capable of learning essons. 'Time will tell how important this is for us,' said Wenger. 'But this win increases the level of belief and the five months that are ahead of us now are very important to the life span of the team.' The peculiar things about Wenger these days is that his rhetoric constantly sounds like that of the underdog. It's hard to think that this is the same coach who threatened to change the landscape of domestic English football when his team threatened the hegemony of United a little over ten years ago. Spaniard Cazorla kept his composure to fire Arsenal into a first-half lead from the penalty spot . Yesterday Arsenal were competitive in every way and deserved their victory, regardless of the validity of the penalty that edged them in to an important lead. When City had the ball Arsenal's midfield players closed the space in which the Premier League champions' more creative players like to work. Equally Arsenal were resolute at corners – City had sixteen – and the statistics show they won 61 per cent of the game's aerial contests. That in itself if a remarkable recovery by a team that defended so horribly in losing at Southampton on New Year's Day , for example. The obvious question now is whether Arsenal can maintain this. It is, after all, something that has proved elusive for a long time. The Arsenal defence was resolute throughout, defending well from set pieces and nullifying City's attack . 'It helps that we have players back and fit,' said Wenger. 'From that point of view, this has been a very important period.' As odd as it was to see Arsenal win with a degree of comfort, here, so it was to see City struggle. This was only the third time since November 2010 that City have failed to score in a home league game. Previously it happened against Stoke this season and Chelsea last. They did have opportunities and on other occasions one would probably have gone in. Having said that, it is not unusual to see them struggle for persistent and progressive possession against teams with centrally creative players. Manchester City manager, prowling the touchline on Sunday, failed to keep his side on the heels of Chelsea . In recent times, they have laboured here against Barcelona, Chelsea, Bayern Munich and even AS Roma, for example, and there are occasions when the Brazilian central duo of Fernandinho and Fernando look a little short. Certainly, it does not bode well for the resumption of their Champions League campaign next month. On Sunday, Cazorla and Aaron Ramsey passed the ball through the heart of the City midfield too easily. As such, Martin Demichelis and the returning Vincent Kompany found themselves exposed to Arsenal's runners. Both had rather uncomfortable afternoons. Last night Manuel Pellegrini and his squad flew to Abu Dhabi for a week of warm weather training and a friendly against Hamburg. Beyond that, though, the champions have a home FA Cup tie against Middlesbrough and then, ominously, a league encounter at Chelsea. Manchester City players look down beat during the comprehensive 2-0 home defeat to Arsenal on Sunday . Lose that one and City will have it all on to retain their title, regardless of the return of new signing Wilfried Bony later next month. City are well in this race and are the kind of team that are capable of winning game after game, as they showed in winning eleven out of twelve prior to their recent draw at Everton. One feels, though, that they must take a point from Chelsea at least to ensure two horses remain involved in this season's title race. That is a contest in which Arsenal were never likely to play a part, of course, but a place in the top four remains a feasible objective.","Arsenal beat Manchester City 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday .

"Photographs of British war hero Field Marshal Montgomery returning to the scene of his greatest victory 25 years later have emerged for sale. The candid images show Montgomery as an old man setting foot at El Alamein in Egypt to mark the anniversary of the Allies' first major triumph against Germans in World War Two. The famous British general, affectionately known as Monty, led an army of more than 200,000 in 1942 and emerged victorious. Historic trip: Field Marshal Montgomery, aged 80, climbs into a Wessex helicopter as he returns to El Alamein, in Egypt, in 1967, 25 years after the famous World War II battle . Famous return: Field Marshal Montgomery led an army of 200,000 in the battle in 1942. The pictures were taken by acclaimed war photographer Don McCullin . The victory marked a major turning point of the war as it revived moral in the flagging troops. In 1967 Montgomery, then aged 80, returned to the desert to visit the scene of the Battle of El Alamein and pay his respects to the thousands of men who died. His trip was covered in a magazine article at the time and appeared in a book about the battle. Decorated: Field Marshal Montgomery, who died in 1980 . A selection of the photos of him taken by acclaimed war photographer Don McCullin have surfaced 46 years after the moving visit. The . images portray Montgomery as an elderly man meeting the top brass of . the Egyptian Army while surrounded by a scrum of photographers. He is also seen having to be helped into a Wessex helicopter. The photos are part of an archive belonging to the late journalist Derek Jewell, organiser of the Alamein trip, which also includes a series of letters from the war general and a signed copy of his memoirs. In the correspondence, Montgomery thanks Jewell for organising the trip, stating 'the way you carried out the preliminary reconnaissance, and then organised and controlled the actual visit, was beyond all praise'. A personal note to Jewell in the front of Montgomery's memoirs said he was 'a chief of staff par excellence under such conditions' and is signed 'Montgomery of Alamein'. The collection was passed down through Jewell's family following his death in 1985. It is expected to fetch £8,000 when it goes under the hammer at auction tomorrow. John Black, of auctioneers Sworders of . Essex, said: 'To mark the 25th anniversary of the Battle of Alamein, . Derek Jewell organised for Field Marshal Montgomery to return to the . site of the battle. 'It was . no mean feat - by that point Monty was a frail old man. He was . incredibly stubborn and he always liked to have his own way. Battle: An explosion at El Alamein whiche ended in the victory of the British Eighth Army commanded by Montgomery over Rommel's Afrika Korps. It proved to be the turning point in the war in Africa . The Battle of El Alamein was widely hailed as one of the turning points in the Second World War. More than 4,000 Allied servicemen lost their lives and almost 9,000 were wounded in the combat that saw General Sir Bernard Montgomery's troops defeat German general Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps. Under the command of Montgomery, nearly 200,000 British, Australian, New Zealand, South African, British Indian, Free French and Greek forces defeated the Axis powers. At the time of the battle, which began on October 23, 1942 and ended on November 4, the Allies were fighting to keep their vital supply lines open from the Mediterranean to the East. Rommel had inflicted heavy defeats on Allied forces in Africa, forcing them back to the village of El Alamein, about 60 miles west of Alexandria. Finally, on October 23 General Montgomery ordered a counter-attack with almost 900 guns levelled at the German positions to be discharged at once. While previously the Suez Canal was threatened, and with it Allied access to the rich oilfields of the Middle East, now the Allies were able to press their advantage and eventually push the Germans and Italians out of Africa. Recalling the importance of the Allied victory at the Battle of El Alamein, Sir Winston Churchill said: 'Before Alamein we never had a victory. After Alamein we never had a defeat.' The Battle of Stalingrad between the Germans and the Soviets in 1942-43, and the Battle of Midway between the US and Japan, are also regarded as key turning points in the war.

"Accident: Clayton Butler died on Saturday after he crashed during a paraglide jump off Hawaii's Kaena Point and fell 50 feet . A 30-year-old extreme sports enthusiast who lost his new bride in a botched BASE jump has died nearly a year later in a paragliding accident. It was just two weeks after their wedding that Clayton Butler watched his wife Amber Bellows, 28, plummet 2,000 feet to her death after her parachute failed to deploy jumping off a famed peak in Utah's Zion National Park. On Saturday, Butler tragically joined his bride in death while on a vacation to Hawaii. The daredevil jumped off Kaena Point, on the island of Oahu, to paraglide, but crashed and fell about 50 feet. He was rushed to the hospital in critical condition where he later died. The medical examiner said he died due to 'blunt force injuries to the torso'. The accident is still under investigation. In a Facebook post about a week before the accident, Butler wrote that he was travelling to Hawaii to go 'Wingsuiting, speed flying and base jumpin. See if I can't find a snorkel and board for a few days too'. It's unclear if paragliding is allowed on Kaena Point. Butler's best friend Josh Lloyd said his death was 'a tragic accident and nothing more' and that the couple will be missed throughout their community in the Salt Lake City, Utah area. 'Clayton was one of the hardest working and most passionate extreme athletes I’ve ever worked with. As his friend, I can also tell you he was a very sincere and generous person,' Lloyd told KSL. The couple made headlines last year after Amber's premature death marked the first BASE jumping fatality for Zion National Park. Scroll down for video . Just newlyweds: Butler lost his wife Amber Bellows (right) in a similar accident nearly a year ago. The couple had only been married two weeks when they decided to BASE jump off Mount Kinesava in Utah's Zion National Park. Amber jumped first and died when her parachute failed to deploy. Pictured above in a photo posted to her husband's Facebook . Scene of the crash: Butler jumped off Kaena Point (pictured above) on Saturday. He was rushed to the hospital in critical condition where he later died . The newlyweds hiked up the park's Mount Kinesava  the morning of February 8 to jump off the staggering cliff, against park rules. In the wake of the tragedy, Butler appears to have posted pictures to his Facebook, showing their several hours hike up the mountain that day. It's unclear if the photos were taken from the same day she died, but one of the shows shows Mount Kinesava bathed in early morning light. Other photos in the same set uploaded four days after the tragedy shows Amber climbing up a rocky trail and posing against the scenic canyons of Zion. Adventurers: In pictured posted to Butler's facebook just four days after he died, his wife Amber is seen hiking up a rocky trail that appears to be Zion National Park  - where the fatal BASE jump happened . Mountain lovers: The jump happened just two weeks after Butler wed Amber (pictured in her wedding dress on the left) Their target: Mount Kinesava is seen in this picture Butler  posted to Facebook four days after his wife died jumping off the cliff . Amber was the first to jump  that afternoon, and her husband knew something was wrong when her parachute didn't deploy at the correct time. He immediately jumped after her but could not save her. Even more painfully, it took him four hours to hike out of the park to get help to retrieve her body. The National Park Service fined Butler $5,000 after the accident, for violating the park's prohibition on BASE jumping. Won't stop: Butler continued his life of extreme sports after his wife died.

"Incredible stories of bravery have emerged today after a devastating two-mile wide tornado decimated a small Oklahoma town, leaving at least 24 people dead including nine children. One heroic teacher who shielded students with her body from the ferocious winds said on Tuesday that one terrified child had cried: 'I love you, I love you, please don't die with me' as the building came down on top of them. Rhonda Crosswhite hurried her fourth-grade students into bathroom stalls at Plaza Towers Elementary in Moore, Oklahoma on Monday afternoon at 3pm (CST) as the giant twister bore down.

Then we heard the tornado, it sounded like a train coming by. 'Then . we were all in cover. A teacher took cover of us, Miss Crosswhite. She . was covering me and my friend Zachary. I told her we were fine because . we were holding on to something then she went over to my friend Antonio . and covered him. So she saved our lives.' At nearby Briarwood Elementary, students took shelter in hallways . and under their desks as the tornado headed straight for them. Miraculously, most escaped with minor injuries despite EF5 damage being reported nearby.  However first-grade teacher Suzanne Hale was impaled by a metal pole through her lower leg as she protected her students. A second-grade teacher Annette Brown told newsok.com . how she and students, including her son who attends the school, were pinned to the ground by a . collapsed roof.  She said that she held her son's hand for the entire . time despite losing feeling in her arms. David Wheeler told the New York Post that he drove at 100mph to reach his eight-year-old son Gabriel. He said he arrived to find the school completely gone but his son sitting with a teacher, bruised and with cuts, but otherwise okay. He said that Gabriel's teacher - who Mr Wheeler identified as Julie Simon - had saved her students' lives by putting them in the closet after thinking the hallway did not look safe. Relief: David Wheeler (pictured with his son Gabriel) said he drove at 100mph to rescue his son from Briarwood Elementary which was also hit by the tornado.

As she holds him tight, she tells him: 'I love you' Overwhelmed: One tearful rescuer said 'good job, teach' after he pulled a woman shielding three children with her body from under a car which had been tossed into the Tower Plaza school's hallway. Right, rescuers lift an injured person from the school into an ambulance . One . little girl, who was not identified, told News9 that she clung to her . desk when the tornado hit. She told the TV station that dirt got in her . eyes and desks piled up on top of each other. Another told how they were told to cover their heads with their arms as the ceiling tiles flew off. Plaza Towers, a one-story school,which was built 57 years ago and is made of cinder block, had its roof torn off in 200mph winds. Few homes in Oklahoma have basements, which means that many families instead rely on 'safe rooms' for shelter during a tornado. Basements . are rare in the state because of the damp soil, meaning water seeps . into storm cellars and basements, which leads to mold and fungus. Water . pressure can also build up due to the soaked soil, which puts pressure . on basement walls and the concrete can eventually give way. Much of Oklahoma is also built on bedrock, which can be hard to break down for the basement. Neither . Moore nor Oklahoma City have designated public storm shelters, and . residents are told to go to their basements or storm cellars if they . have them. If they do not, they are advised to go to interior hallways and to stay away from windows.. Another . Plaza teacher, Becky Jo Evans was hailed a hero after she also shielded . students with her body as the walls of the school crumbled around them, . according to the LA Times. One neighbor who had run to the school . for shelter said: 'They [students] crouched in hallways and bathrooms, . waiting, hoping and praying. Then the school started coming apart.' As remarkable stories of courage and survival emerged, the desperate search for missing people waned. Initial reports said as many as 91 people across the suburb south of Oklahoma City could have been killed in the tragedy, but officials confirmed on Tuesday morning that there have been 24 deaths. They explained that some had been counted twice amid the chaos. They now fear for as many as 40 . others and expect the death count to rise. At least 240 people are . injured, 60 of these children. Oklahoma hospitals are packed with people suffering head injuries and lacerations from flying debris. Parents . of missing children from Plaza Towers Elementary had waited at St Andrews United Methodist . Church nearby the school on Monday, some with nowhere else to go. The . names of those who were pulled alive from the wreckage were called out . with a bullhorn. For many parents, the agonizing wait continues. Another teacher who works at Plaza told of his heartbreak at what had happened to the little school with 500 students and around 50 teaching staff. Hayden Young wrote on his Facebook page: 'I . want everyone to know I am okay!  I am so broken from all I have . witnessed today and tonight helping out at Plaza. 'I don't know how to . describe it, but just tragic... And overwhelming..  We got a great . staff and brave people who work a Plaza. 'In the aftermath that I . witnessed helping families, my heart is truly overwhelmed and broken.... I am praying and believing God has a purpose in this.'

"Border officials have come up with a new way of encouraging illegal immigrants to go home: asking them nicely. A £10,000 advertising campaign designed to tempt illegal immigrants to leave the UK without facing arrest and deportation was launched yesterday – and immediately branded ‘breathtakingly stupid’. It is the latest attempt by the Home Office to target nearly 200,000 people thought to have stayed in Britain illegally after their visas expired. Ministers said the campaign offered migrants an ‘alternative to being led away in handcuffs’. The advert states: ‘In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest. Text HOME to 78070 for free advice, and help with travel documents. We can help you return home voluntarily without fear of arrest or detention.’ Advertisment: Vans bearing signs asking illegal immigrants to text the government are being driven around London . Vans carrying campaign posters will be driven around London over the coming days, carrying a warning message for illegal migrants. The advert calls for illegal immigrants to text ‘HOME’ to 78070. If they do, the Home Office will give them free advice on how to go home, and help getting a new passport if they need one. However the advert also comes with a warning – that anyone who refuses to go will face arrest. A source said it was ‘a lot cheaper getting them on an easyJet flight than spending £11,000 removing someone from the country’. Officials said the campaign, which cost £10,000, would pay for itself if just one migrant returned home. But Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘The breathtaking stupidity of the people in charge of our immigration system knows no bounds. Overstayed: The Home Office believes 200,000 people may still be in the UK after their visas have expired . ‘If they still made Monty Python, then Minister for Silly Walks would be proposing this. ‘It actually is an indication of a weakness that we’re having to implore people to leave the country. It’s pathetic. The fact is there is absolutely zero effort made by law enforcement agencies to get people out when they have come in to the country unlawfully.’ ‘It’s also a measure of their desperation.’ In addition to the advert, leaflets carrying the same message will be left in newsagents, money transfer shops and internet cafes migrants are known to go to, and adverts placed in local newspapers. Two vans will be driven around Hounslow, Barking & Dagenham, Ealing, Barnet, Brent and Redbridge this week showing the advert and displaying figures on how many illegal migrants have been arrested recently in each area. Help: Illegal immigrants who text the new number will be offered free advice on how to get back home . Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: ‘We are making it more difficult for people to live and work in the UK illegally. Every single day our enforcement officers are arresting, detaining and removing people with no right to be in the UK. ‘But there is an alternative to being led away in handcuffs. Help and advice can be provided to those who cooperate and return home voluntarily. ‘This pilot is just another part of the reforms of the immigration system that have cut out abuse and seen net migration drop to its lowest levels in nearly a decade. The Immigration Bill being introduced later this year will build on this work by restricting illegal migrants’ access to benefits and services.’ More than 28,000 illegal migrants returned home voluntarily last year – but official estimates suggest there are nearly 200,000 illegal overstayers still in the country after their visas have expired.","Border officials releasing advert asking illegal immigrants to text them .

"Bradford City's FA Cup third round replay against Millwall descended into chaos at Valley Parade in the first-half as their players and staff became embroiled in a mass brawl on the touchline. Millwall's Alan Dunne pushed Bradford's James Hanson, forcing the striker into the advertising hoardings. That sparked a touchline bust-up with almost the entire playing and coaching staff involved. Referee James Adcock  seemingly missed at least two punches from Millwall keeper David Forde who had sprinted 30 yards to get involved. Millwall keeper David Forde appears to punch Bradford striker Jon Stead during the feisty FA Cup clash . Forde is the centre of the mass touchline brawl between the Bradford and Millwall players at Valley Parade . Adcock eventually restored order and booked Forde, Dunne and Bradford's Billy Knott but also sent Bradford manager Phil Parkinson and his assistant Steve Parkin to the stands for their part in the trouble. After the match Parkinson said: 'The lad Dunne has pushed Hanson into the advertising boards and I thought it was a dangerous challenge because there’s a wall just behind there. 'Me and Steve have reacted and run down, as well as some of their coaching staff but the ref has decided to send me and Steve to the stands. ‘The ref said it was for leaving the technical area. I was trying to make sure there was no brawl but it certainly wasn’t to instigate anything. I know that you can’t leave the technical area but I thought being sent to the stands was a little bit harsh. Coaching staff intervened as both sets of players became embroiled in a nasty brawl in the first-half . Forde was hauled back after he got involved and appeared to land a punch on Stead . ‘You can get a yellow card for trying to injure an opposing player but me and Steve got sent to the stands. We’ll have to take that on the chin and I’m glad it hasn’t ruined a great night. ‘I said to the lads at half-time I’ve got to apologise for that because I ask the boys to keep their cool and stay on the pitch and in the heat of the moment I’ve reacted to a dangerous challenge.’ There had already been controversy at Valley Parade after Hanson got the wrong side of Millwall's Mark Beevers, who dragged him down and received a straight red within six minutes. It went from bad to worse for Ian Holloway's side, who thanks to goals from Hanson, Stead and Andy Halliday, went into the half-time break three down and eventually lost 4-0 thanks to a Billy Knott strike to exit the FA Cup on a sour note.

"He is known for handing out giftwrapped presents to team-mates. So it came as no surprise that Manchester United playmaker Juan Mata repeated the trick when he delivered dozens of toys to a primary school in one of the city's toughest areas. The Spain international, 26, teamed up with a pal who owns a toy brand to dish out gifts to youngsters at the school and across Greater Manchester. Juan Mata (right) handed out presents to youngsters at a school in Manchester . Manchester United star Mata teamed up with a friend who owns a toy brand to give out the presents . The children were all too happy to take advantage of Mata's visit and collect a late Christmas present . Mata's manager, Louis van Gaal, may also have been happy to see him following in his footsteps when he took a PE lesson. United's Dutch supremo was a PE teacher back in his homeland and will have been impressed by Mata's masterly skills when he put the four to six-year-olds through their paces at Wythenshawe's Button Lane Primary. In total Mata and his friend have donated 500 toys which will the club's charity arm, the Manchester United Foundation, will distribute to 49 schools. He explained: 'I have a good friend who owns a toy brand and we thought it would be nice to work together for the kids here in Manchester and in my hometown of Oviedo, to give these gifts to school children, but also for kids who are in hospital and kids who may not have had gifts from their parents this Christmas.' Mata, who missed three decent chances in United's 1-0 home defeat to Southampton on Sunday, soon had a smile back on his face. Mata (left) watches on as the children at the school he visited take part in a PE lesson . The deputy head at the school said Mata's visit was a pleasant surprise for the pupils . 'It’s been a very nice experience for me to come here today.' he said. 'The kids seem really happy with the gifts and I want to try and do this as much as I can, not only me but the other players as it can be easy for us to do something like this.' Tracey Palmer, deputy head at the school, revealed that the visit stunned her unknowing pupils. 'In assembly I explained someone famous was coming into school and the children have been intrigued all day. 'The fact that Juan has given up his own time to come along is wonderful. He’s a great inspiration and this visit will be life changing for some of these children as they never get to meet anybody famous and probably never will again.' Following United's defeat to Southampton, Mata vowed that the team will hit back during the season . Mata was praised by the teachers for giving up his spare time to visit the children at the school . Following the loss to Ronald Koeman's high-flying Saints, former Chelsea Mata vowed to come back stronger on his blog.

"Jonas Gutierrez is standing, shivering and bobble-hatted, outside a changing-room he has just shared with a team of teenagers at a ground which barely holds 500 spectators. The North Tyneside air is biting cold and rain spits through the steel staircase which doubles as shelter from these coarse climes. Gutierrez, though, is burning with passion and appreciation. It is the little things which matter most to him now. Like waking up every morning and driving to training. The promise of a kickabout with his pals. Sharing a cup of mate – Argentina's national tea drink - with best friend Fabricio Coloccini. Running naked around the corridors of Newcastle United's training ground, much to the amusement of team-mates and staff. Giving an interview as a footballer. Jonas Gutierrez brings the ball forwad for Newcastle's Under 21 side in a game against Bolton Wanderers . The midfielder scored his first goal since beating testicular cancer against the Trotters on Monday night . Gutierrez (hidden) is mobbed by his team-mates after finding the back of the net at Whitley Park . The little things matter when you've beaten something as big as cancer, a battle the 31-year-old has twice fought, and twice won. But the prospect of one special day still excites Gutierrez. 'Yes, I have played in a World Cup, but if I play again for Newcastle then that will be the best moment of my career,' he tells Sportsmail having earlier scored his first goal – a 20-yard beauty curled into the top corner – since returning to the north-east last month to build fitness as skipper of Peter Beardsley's Under 21 side. 'To get back after the cancer and chemotherapy, to put all of that behind me, would be a huge moment for me. It would be emotional. 'If I come back and play for Newcastle then for me it will be the best.' There have been reports that Gutierrez will never play for Newcastle again because one more appearance triggers an extension to his contract, which expires in the summer. This, however, is not true. Rather, it will take at least seven more games to activate that clause. Gutierrez has not played for the Magpies since October, 2013, the same month he was diagnosed with testicular cancer. A huge screen at St James' Park shows a 'United for Jonas' message during Newcastle's win over Liverpool . Former Mallorca man Gutierrez lost all of his hair after undergoing chemotherapy for testicular cancer . Gutierrez made his return to action in an Under 21 game against West Ham United on December 22 . Ex-Argentina midfielder Gutierrez drives forward during his country's World Cup clash with Mexico in 2010 . He returned to Argentina for treatment where he had a testicle removed and was given the all-clear. The cancer, however, returned in June of last year. This time, chemotherapy was necessary. The importance of football, he concedes, was soon relegated. 'There was a time when all I could think about was the treatment and I had to put myself in the hands of the doctors,' he recalls. 'I was always positive and I told my family and friends, ""Listen, the most important thing is to be healthy again"". I did not know what was going to happen in the future at that moment. 'All I wanted was to be healthy and come through all of my chemotherapy. But it was hard. When I was first told about the cancer I went home to my dad and cried. 'Then, it was hard to find my hair fall out. I did not want to cut it and I wanted to hold on. 'Fighting cancer makes the rest of the problems seem insignificant.' That, then, is why he now takes so much pleasure from what the majority of sportsmen – and the rest of us, for that matter – take for granted. 'Just waking up in the morning and knowing I can train after all of the treatment and chemotherapy, that is the most important,' he says, having been discharged from hospital in early November. The 31-year-old has become a favourite among fans since signing for Newcastle back in 2008 . Gutierrez (left) pulls off a sliding tackle during his first game back in the black and white stripes . Gutierrez discovered he had cancer after a foul by Bacary Sagna (right) in May 2013 left him needing a scan . Gutierrez, pictured in action during his first game back, has captained Peter Beardsley's Under 21 side . 'I love to do all of this – these are the types of things I have missed. All of these things during my treatment I was not allowed to do. I enjoy this now more than ever. 'If I remember what has happened to me then I assure you, I have enjoyed every day of training, every little thing. 'It is a pleasure to be with my team-mates every day.' Gutierrez has always been a favourite at St James' Park. He arrived from Real Mallorca in 2008 bearing the moniker 'Spiderman' – he once promised a young boy he met at the cinema that he would wear the superhero's mask in celebration of his next goal and that he duly did – and later donned his disguise in front of the Leazes End following a solo strike against Barnsley in the Championship-winning season. That the Argentina international stayed at the club following relegation from the Premier League in 2009 cemented his standing among the Toon Army. It was not forgotten. 'I was in tears when I heard my name sung on television,' says Gutierrez, remembering the moment he watched a Newcastle match from his home in Buenos Aries during his recovery and broke down upon hearing the terrace tribute. 'I say thank you to those fans. That has always been there with me, always. Through all of my treatment the messages and support from the Newcastle fans was special, it made me happy. 'To be at home in Argentina and hear my song and then the clapping in the 18th minute (in recognition of his squad number) was very emotional – I don't have the words to say what power that gave me. Gutierrez celebrates a goal against Barnsley in 2010 by putting on a Spiderman mask at St James' Park . Gutierrez winks at the camera as he leads out Newcastle's Under 21 side ahead of kick-off at Whitley Park . Gutierrez has now successfully beaten cancer on two occasions after getting the all-clear in early November . 'It is true that it gives you the strength to go forward.' Gutierrez, though, is not yet ready for a return to St James'. 'It is hard for me,' he says. 'For now, I prefer to be at home and watch on TV. It's hard to be in the changing-room at this moment.' Instead, Gutierrez wants to return as a player. 'I have been at this club and in this city for seven years. The welcome from the fans from the day I arrived has been special, I have always had a special relationship with them,' he adds. 'But I have to get fit and be right (before I return). Then we will speak about what happens next. 'If you watch all of the games I have played in since coming back then I have been improving in every one of them. 'Now, I feel really good. Maybe in two weeks I will be at 100 per cent. Maybe then I can sprint past someone in a one-on-one, but that is the last part of being ready to play, that is normal. 'I need to have that in my locker before I play, because that was always one of the most important parts on my game, playing on the wing and getting past players. 'I want to get back to that and I feel I am now close. Maybe now I will have to buy a new Spiderman mask!' Mask or no mask, when he eventually does run out in front of 52,000 Geordies he will receive a superhero's reception. For Gutierrez, that will be no small thing.","Jonas Gutierrez wants to play for Newcastle before the end of the season .

"Former Sweden and Leeds United forward Tomas Brolin may once have been voted runner-up in the 50 worst footballers to grace the Premier League, but he seems pretty chilled out about it.

"Cristiano Ronaldo returned to training at Real Madrid a hero after winning the Ballon d'Or award for a second successive year. The Portuguese superstar showed off the shiny golden award to coach Carlo Ancelotti and his team-mates after seeing off competition from Lionel Messi and Manuel Neuer to win the world's best player crown for a third time. He was joined by James Rodriguez, Toni Kroos and Sergio Ramos, who also had silverware to show off after Monday night's glittering ceremony in Zurich, Switzerland.

Ramos and Kroos, meanwhile, were named in the FIFA FIFPro World XI for 2014 along with Angel di Maria, who moved from Real to Manchester United over the summer. Despite leading Real to their elusive 10th European Cup success, Ancelotti missed out on the coach of the year award which went to German World Cup-winner Joachim Low.

Ronaldo, 29, was the hot favourite to claim the main prize after an outstanding 2014 that saw him score 61 goals for club and country, provid 22 assists and claim nine club and individual honours. He played an integral part as Real won the Champions League, rounding off a 4-1 win over city rivals Atletico Madrid in May's Lisbon final. Real also won the Copa del Rey, UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup. Averaging a goal every 62 minutes in La Liga during the calendar year of 2014, Ronaldo also claimed the top scorer trophy.

Ronaldo scored a remarkable 61 goals for club and country Portugal during the calendar year of 2014 . Among the many medals acquired by Ronaldo in 2014 was the UEFA Super Cup in August . Ronaldo was a clear winner with 37.66 per cent of total votes cast by a panel made up of captains, coaches and media members from all FIFA affiliate associations. Messi took second with 15.76 per cent, just ahead of Neuer on 15.72. Ronaldo said: 'I am extremely happy and proud to receive this award and I want to keep challenging myself every day.

Ramos and Kroos took their place in the World XI alongside Neuer, David Luiz, Thiago Silva, Philipp Lahm, Di Maria, Andres Iniesta, Messi, Ronaldo and Arjen Robben. February 11 - Getting straight back to record-breaking business after clinching his second Ballon d'Or a month earlier, Ronaldo surpassed Luis Aragones' achievements in the history of Copa del Rey games between Real and Atletico Madrid by scoring a brace against the Rojiblancos. Aragones had scored five goals for Atleti but his record had remained unchallenged since the 1970s. More intriguingly Ronaldo's first goal in the derby, a penalty in the seventh minute, meant the Portuguese had scored in every possible minute of a 90-minute game. May 24 - Ronaldo had been conspicuous by his absence from the scoresheet but it looked like Real had managed to do enough to thwart city rivals Atletico at the end of a dramatic Champions League final in Lisbon. However, he would make his mark in the 121st minute of play, scoring the penalty that made it 4-1 and rubber-stamped 'La Decima'. It was also his 17th goal in that season's tournament, a new record. October 25 - An opening goal against title rivals Barcelona was Ronaldo's 15th in his last seven league games and broke a Real record set by Hungary great Ferenc Puskas in both the 1959-60 and 1960-61 campaigns. Puskas had scored 13 times through seven consecutive league games. December 6 - Ronaldo's 23rd hat-trick in Real colours, this time plundered at the expense of Celta Vigo, was not only a Primera Division record but meant the Portuguese had become the fastest player in La Liga history to score 200 goals. December 20 - His Barcelona rival Lionel Messi might have beaten him to the title of all-time Champions League goalscorer, but Ronaldo was hardly complaining when his 72nd Champions League goal - scored in a 4-0 thumping of Ludogorets - boosted him beyond Real stalwart Raul's previous competition record. He is three goals behind Messi, but now only one Ballon d'Or behind the Argentinian.

"Boxing legend Muhammad Ali has been pictured with his family on his birthday following his latest spell in hospital. Ali, who turned 73 on Saturday, was shown  with his daughter Maryum Ali, who uploaded a picture of the pair to Twitter. The snap, apparently taken at his home in Scottsdale, Arizona, showed the athlete, who has Parkinson's disease, in a chair with his daughter standing behind him. Muhammad Ali, who was 73 on Saturday, posed for this picture with his daughter, Maryum . She wrote: 'My father, aka. Muhammad Ali, is at home and looking forward to celebrating his 73rd Birthday tomorrow.' He had been admitted to the hospital earlier this week as follow-up to a problem that surfaced last month. A family spokesman said: 'He's home and resting and glad to be out of the hospital. He added that Ali family 'greatly appreciates the outpouring of support and continued well wishes.' The former three-time heavyweight world champion has been hospitalized twice in the past month. Ali was first admitted on December 20 with what was believed to be a mild case of pneumonia. Ali, a three-time world champion, is seen above knocking Chuck Wepner against the ropes at a 1975 bout i . Ali, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, retired in 1981 after a phenomenal career . But doctors later determined he was actually suffering from a urinary tract infection. Ali, who is nicknamed The Greatest and the Louisville Lip, retired from boxing in 1981 with a 56-5 record. He had not been pictured for months until the birthday photograph. His public appearances have diminished in recent years due to his illness, but he still enjoys getting out and watching sports and visiting friends. Ali appeared in public in September at a ceremony in his hometown of Louisville for the Muhammad Ali Humanitarian Awards. He did not speak to the crowd but posed for photos with award winners, including former NFL great Jim Brown. Brown leaned over and whispered to the seated Ali during the photo session. Later, Brown said he told Ali: 'You're the greatest of all time.'

"A child who was suspected to have been infected with Ebola has been cleared of the illness in a Melbourne hospital on Sunday. The one-year-old Nigerian baby was rushed to the Royal Children's Hospital on Friday after presenting symptoms similar to those experienced by Ebola patients. It was understood that the child had arrived in Australia after being in a West African nation where the disease is known to be prevalent. Scroll down for video . A one-year-old Nigerian baby was rushed to Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital after presenting Ebola symptoms on Friday . Paramedics donning full protective suits transferred the baby to an isolation room according to the Herald Sun. The Ebola scare would have been the first real test of Victoria's Ebola Virus Disease Response Plan which was rolled out across metropolitan and regional health services following a scare in Brisbane earlier this month. Victorian health minister David Davis issued a statement on Thursday outlined the details of the Response Plan. 'The plan outlines the exact actions that will be taken by the Department of Health, Commonwealth border agencies, Ambulance Victoria, any health service and in particular the two hospitals that will receive a suspected case,'the statement said. Pictured: An official health checkpoint for Ebola in Nigeria. Earlier this month, a Brisbane man was feared to have Ebola after returning from a trip to the Congo . 'The Royal Melbourne Hospital is the designated facility for assessment and management of patients suspected to have a Viral Haemorrhagic Fever such as Ebola virus disease and is fully prepared. 'The plan requires the patient to be isolated in a single occupancy negative pressure room. Treatment and care would be provided by staff trained to use infection control precautions including specific personal protective equipment.' Boarder control measures have also been put into place, according to Victoria's Chief Health Officer, Dr Rosemary Lester, including questionnaires for people arriving from affected countries. 'All people returning from affected countries are given a card telling them to look out for symptoms for 21 days and to attend an emergency department or GP if they do become unwell,' she said. The Nigerian baby incident is the second scare involving Ebola on Australian shores this month. It comes shortly after a Brisbane man was feared to have been infected with the disease following his return from a trip to the Congo in August.","The baby was rushed to the Royal Children's Hospital on Friday .

"Federal Treasurer Joe Hockey has made another political gaffe, claiming a child born today is going to live to 150 to justify his cuts to Medicare. Mr Hockey was speaking on Fairfax Radio on Monday morning and was trying to convince Australians that they should pay for their health care. 'It's kind of remarkable that somewhere in the world today, it's highly probable that a child is being born that is going to live to 150,' Mr Hockey was reported as saying by the Sydney Morning Herald. Scroll down for video . The treasurer also refused to address reports he and Prime Minister Tony Abbott argued over a scuttled $20 Medicare rebate cut, labelling the rumours as 'gossip' He continued: 'How do we ensure that we have good quality of life the whole way through? This is the conversation we are going to be having with the Australian people over the next few months.' The treasurer also refused to address reports he and Prime Minister Tony Abbott argued over a scuttled $20 Medicare rebate cut, labelling the rumours as 'gossip'. This comes after it was reported by News Corp Mr Abbott pushed on with the $20 cut despite heated opposition from Mr Hockey, and former health minister Peter Dutton, before it was ultimately scrapped amid a public and doctor backlash. When asked if the report was wrong, Mr Hockey refused to comment. 'I'm not going to engage in discussion on gossip,' Mr Hockey said. 'Sometimes it's better to reverse a position than continue with a decision that's going to have bad ramifications.' Mr Hockey said 2015 would be about 'jobs and families', and said lower petrol prices had put money back in family pockets. He also said changes to the GST were unlikely without agreement from Labor and state governments. 'In relation to the GST it is our very strong view you've got to have unanimous agreement,' Mr Hockey said. Before this gaffe, Mr Hockey also caused embarrassment to the Prime Minister after declaring Mr Abbott had sought advice from News Corp boss Rupert Murdoch on paid parental leave before consulting his colleagues . This latest incident comes after the treasurer said poor people did not drive cars. He made the comments while the government was looking to reintroduce twice-yearly indexation of the fuel excise, a budget measure opposed by both Labor and the Greens who said it would hit low-income families the hardest. 'The poorest people either don't have cars or actually don't drive very far in many cases,' he told ABC Radio. Before this gaffe, Mr Hockey also caused embarrassment to the Prime Minister after declaring Mr Abbott had sought advice from News Corp boss Rupert Murdoch on paid parental leave before consulting his colleagues. The treasurer revealed details of the private meeting in his book, Hockey: Not Your Average Joe. It is claimed by Mr Hockey that Mr Abbott only mentioned the paid parental scheme to him as 'a brief add-on in a telephone conversation, with no specific date or details attached', before it was announced. 'They were encouraged to support it [Murdoch's editors], notwithstanding that it represented a tax impost and was skewed to be of most benefit to parents outside their middle-Australian readership,' Mr Hockey said in the book.","Federal Treasurer made the claim on Fairfax Radio on Monday morning .

"A father who killed his eight-year-old . daughter after mercilessly torturing her with stun guns and hot irons . has been sentenced to death in Dubai, it emerged today. Wadeema al Sherawi had been deprived of food and locked up as punishment for being 'naughty' on the night she died. In desperation, she ate her own faeces . before vomiting and later dying. Her body was found in the desert, but was so badly decomposed, forensic experts could not tell how she had died. Her father Hamad Saoud al Sherawi, . 29, and his mistress Al Anood al Ameri, 27, were found guilty of . torturing and imprisoning Wadeema and her seven-year-old sister Mira, . who escaped death but suffered severe burns and injuries. Horrific abuse: Wadeema al Sherawi and her sister Mira were tortured with hot irons and stun guns by their brutal father. Wadeema was forced to eat her own faeces after being locked in a toilet on the night she died . Following a seven-month trial, the Dubai Court of First Instance sentenced to Al Sherawi to death by firing squad and Al Ameri to life imprisonment, it was reported by Gulf News. The court heard the Emirati couple . beat the girls with electrical wires and metal bars, poured boiling . water on them and burned them with hot irons and cigarettes. Wadeema and Mira, who was left with a permanent disability, were often left unfed and sometimes ate their own faeces. Police corporal Mubarak Ahmed Taleb, . 34, told the trial that the studio apartment where the couple lived with . the two girls was filthy and 'not fit for humans to live in'. He told the court it reeked of stale . urine: 'It smelled really bad and was dirty. There was only one bed and . the furniture was turned upside down. The girls' clothes stank and there . was mess everywhere. 'The fridge was full of food which was out of date. No one could live in it.' Close to death: Mira survived the repeated attacks, but suffered horrific injuries as a result of the torture . Recovering: Mira plays with some toys in hospital. A forensics expert told the trial she was lucky to survive . He said when his investigation team . searched the flat, they found two irons with brown marks on them and . said: 'They had used them to burn the girls.' He added they found some of the implements of torture, including metal bars, sticks and stun guns. During the trial, Al Ameri clutched the couple's sleeping newborn baby to her chest as they heard the case against them. The pair were arrested after the girls' uncle visited the flat in International City, Dubai, and was told by Mira of the abuse. He initially blamed both of them for . Wadeema's death but later changed his story, saying Al Sherawi was 'a . great father who loved his children'. Emirati police officer Essam Obaid told the trial: 'When I questioned Al Ameri, she . claimed she saw Wadeema vomiting heavily and was very sick that evening . so she called Hamad and asked him to come to the flat. Justice: The girls' father, Hamad Saoud al Sherawi, has been sentenced to death, while his mistress Al Anood al Ameri, has been jailed for life over the abuse at their home in International City, Dubai . 'They left her until 5am in the . toilet and when they went to check on her, she was dead. She vomited . because she ate her own excrement. 'Al Ameri admitted heating the irons . and torturing the girls. She said Wadeema was tortured because she did . not listen and was disobedient.' Al Sherawi said he did not mean to kill his daughter, but didn't deny beating or torturing them whenever they turned disobedient. Al Ameri . initially pleaded not guilty, but later told the court that she claimed . full responsibility for the crime and deserved the death penalty. She claimed Al Sherawi wasn't involved. The girls' natural mother Salma Obaid . had to give them up in November 2011 after losing custody and had not . seen them for six months when Wadeema died. She married Al Sherawi in 2002 and . divorced him in 2006. She previously told the court she tried to . convince him to let her see the girls but was forbidden contact with . them. A forensics expert said Mira had been lucky not to die from her injuries. Al Sherawi, who was 15 days to . appeal, will be put to death when the capital punishment becomes . irrevocable and is endorsed by the ruler. The girl's death has since inspired new child-protection legislation, known as Wadeema's law.","Wadeema al Sherawi ate her faeces after being starved and locked in toilet .

"Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan are bribing starving children as young as eight years old to plant deadly roadside booby traps, be decoys in ambushes and even act as suicide bombers. Despite the Islamic fundamentalists’ claim they have no children in their ranks, extremists have been actively recruiting orphaned and homeless young boys and training them to use guns, improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and suicide vests. In return, they ply the desperate youngsters with sweets and chocolate, an investigation for Channel 4’s Dispatches programme has learned. Future threat: Taliban children aged five are pictured being trained to fire guns by extremists in Afghanistan . Afghan orphan Neaz told how he was just eight when he was promised a handful of coins by Taliban fighters to convert him to their cause. The boy had been tending his father’s flock of sheep when coalition forces bombed his village. ‘The Taliban were hiding in our house when a helicopter came and bombed us,’ he said. ‘My father was hit in his heart and his head, he was torn apart. My mother was hit in the chest and died. I have no one.’ In the immediate aftermath of the raid, Neaz was kidnapped by Taliban leaders and taken to a nearby town and shown how to use guns and make IEDs. They plied him with sweets and he was initially delighted when they said they planned to bring him an extra-special gift – a suicide vest packed with bullets and grenades. ‘They made me try it on. The grenades went all around my body and then they offered me the coins [50 Afghanis – about 60p],’ he said. ‘They told me to blow myself up at a checkpoint. I asked what I’d do with the money if I had to blow myself up. But they kept encouraging me, telling me that if I did it I would go to heaven.’ New recruit: A young boy named only as Neaz told investigators how he was just eight-years-old when he was promised a handful of coins, worth about 60p, if he joined their cause . Targeted: Taliban insurgents made Neaz, pictured, try on a suicide vest packed with bullets and grenades before trying to convince him to blow himself up at a checkpoint . On the run: When Neaz realised what the extremists wanted him to do, he escaped and walked nine miles to turn himself in at a police station . He finally escaped and walked nine miles to turn himself in at a police station. Now aged ten, Neaz lives in an orphanage in Lashkar Gah. Other children are less fortunate. There are 224 children in prisons in Helmand and Ghazni, arrested by government forces for planning or carrying out attacks. Film-maker Najibullah Quraishi said: ‘Thousands of children are being recruited and taught to make bombs or become suicide bombers. It is common for 13-year-olds to carry guns. Less than ten per cent of the population is educated so these children don’t have their own minds, they only have what the mullahs are telling them in the mosques.’ Najibullah was given unprecedented access to a £500,000 British-built prison in Helmand, where the cells each hold 20 boys. One, Hannan, was 12 when he joined the Taliban following his father’s death in a US air strike. ‘My father was in the Taliban. When he used a rocket-propelled grenade, I would ask him how it worked. This is how he taught me.’ Orphan: Another boy Hannan, pictured at a British-built prison in Helmand, was 12 when he joined the Taliban after his father was killed in a US air strike . Down the generations: Hannan was taught to use rocket-propelled grenades by his father who was also a member of the Taliban . Behind bars: Hannan, who says he wants revenge for his father's death, was arrested during an ambush he organised and the 15-year-old is now being held at a prison in Helmand . After a year the youngster set up his own military cell with five friends, staging ambushes at night on remote roads. It was during one attack that he was arrested, and he has so far spent two years in prison. Now aged 15, he says: ‘I am not looking for revenge for my father, I want to do Jihad for the sake of  God. It is written in the Koran that you are allowed to kill infidels as you would kill a dog.’ Najibullah added: ‘I felt incredibly sad listening to Hannan and others. They are already dangerous men. When they leave prison they will be recruited for other campaigns. They are determined fighters.’ Most Afghans do not know their date of birth and the Taliban – whose code of conduct allows any male with facial hair to become a fighter – use the uncertainty to insist they don’t use children to fight. Najibullah said: ‘Many believe there will be civil war and it won’t just be the Taliban recruiting children – all groups will target them. They are the fighters of the future and that is a problem not just for Afghanistan but for the world.’","Islamic fundamentalists have claimed they have no children in their ranks .

"Champion boxer Joseph Selkirk has escaped jail after admitting assaulting his girlfriend . Champion boxer Joseph Selkirk has escaped jail after admitting assaulting his girlfriend - Bollywood actress Amy Jackson. The European light-middleweight title holder, 28, originally denied pushing the Bollywood superstar to the ground during a row at the Malmaison hotel in Liverpool on November 8 2013. He vowed to fight any allegations after being charged but pleaded guilty on the first day of his trial at Liverpool Magistrates' Court on March 17. The court heard Malmaison staff became concerned when the couple pulled up in silver Mercedes car and appeared to be having a heated row. Selkirk had been celebrating a win at a boxing match that night and they’d both been drinking. The hotel night porter revealed he saw Selkirk push Ms Jackson, 23, as she tried to get out of the car. The argument continued as the pair entered the hotel. The porter also said he heard Selkirk referred to his model and actress girlfriend as a 'skank', and as the couple left, the porter saw Selkirk use his open palm to push Ms Jackson causing her to stumble on the hotel steps. When the police were called Ms Jackson was said to be holding her jaw and wincing in pain. Selkirk, who is said to now be living in Spain, has been given a 12-month community order and ordered to pay £300 costs.

"Is Yaya right to be angry over birthday snub? Manchester City will block any attempt by Yaya Toure to force a transfer following bizarre claims that the new Premier League champions failed to celebrate his 31st birthday properly. Toure’s agent Dimitry Seluk has warned that the £200,000-a-week Ivory Coast star could quit City this summer, accusing the club of treating him like ‘a nobody’ at a party attended by owner Sheik Mansour and other dignitaries in Abu Dhabi last Tuesday. It emerged on Tuesday that Toure was, in fact, presented with two birthday cakes, on the flight to Abu Dhabi and at the team hotel, and a message on the club’s official Facebook page wishing him a happy birthday received 250,000 ‘likes’ — the most of any post ever on the website. This was not enough for Seluk, however, who drew comparisons with Russian club Anzhi Makhachkala buying Brazilian defender Roberto Carlos a £800,000 Bugatti car for his 38th birthday in 2011.

But when you have a big party to celebrate the title and no one comes to Yaya to say happy birthday, what more do you want? ‘He got a cake but when it was Roberto Carlos’s birthday, the president of Anzhi gave him a Bugatti. ‘The club’s owners ate a 100kg cake after winning the Premier League but when they and the players were all together, none of them shook his hand on his birthday. It shows they don’t care about him. This isn’t about a new contract — it’s about human relationships and City have shown they don’t respect him. ‘If a player like Yaya went to Liverpool and they won the league for the first time in 24 years, Yaya would be a god in Liverpool. But at City Yaya is no hero. He’s nobody. That’s how the club make him feel. ‘He’s very upset and he started thinking about leaving the club. And he will if things carry on like this. If you ask 100 per cent or 50-50, better 50-50 than 100. This is not about money. In fact, he would take less to return to Barcelona. All the staff at Barcelona, and players, liked him. He felt like Barcelona was his home.’ Happy birthday to you! City posted this on their Twitter on May 13 . Size matters! Part of Dimitry Seluk's unhapiness is apparently down to the 1000kg cake enjoyed by City's owners . Winning drive: Dimitry Seluk is also miffed that Roberto Carlos was given a Bugatti Veyron by Anzhi's owner . Toure has been a key figure in helping City win the Premier League and Capital One Cup this season, scoring 24 goals in 49 appearances from midfield. But the controversy comes a year after he threatened to leave because there were not enough shirts bearing his name on sale in the club shop or posters of him around the Etihad Stadium. On that occasion, City placated him with a new four-year contract until 2017 and increased his salary to £10m a year, but there are unlikely to be any concessions this time. Although there is a desire within the club to remain on amicable terms with one of their biggest stars, sources insist Toure will not be sold and there will be no more re-negotiations for a player who has three years left on his contract. One insider dismissed the latest claims yesterday, insisting that Toure is ‘loved at every level of the club’. City gave the player considerable backing when he was the victim of racist abuse during a Champions League tie away to CSKA Moscow in October. Got previous: Yaya Toure was also annoyed when not enough shirts bearing his name were in the club shop . No loyalty! Yay Toure was also backed to the hilt after suffereing racist abuse against CSKA Moscow . The player later tweeted to tell his followers not to believe anything that did not come from him personally, but then made a bizarre U-turn. Toure wrote: ‘Thanks for all the birthday messages today. Card from City just arrived... Must have got lost in the post. Haha.’ He then tweeted: ‘Jokes aside. Please do not take words that do not come out of MY mouth seriously’ before posting: ‘Everything dimitry said is true. He speaks for me. I will give an interview after world cup to explain.’ Please: @BeardedGenius struck up a tongue-in-cheek appeal for clubs to show Yaya Toure some love .","Manchester City will block Yaya Toure from moving over birthday snub .

"Control of a Baltimore prison was effectively handed over to a group of gang member inmates who seduced and bribed the female guards. Federal prosecutors say 13 female correctional officers, seven inmates and five others with gang ties have been charged with plotting to smuggle drugs, cellphones and other contraband into the Baltimore jail and other corrections facilities. An indictment unsealed Tuesday said the ring also involved sex between inmates and guards that led to four of the officers becoming pregnant by Tavon White, leader of a jailhouse gang called the Black Guerrilla Family. BUSY MAN: Convict Tavon White has impregnated four female guards at his prison . Under gang control: The Baltimore City Detention Center (pictured) was reportedly run by the gang-member inmates who seduced female prison guards who they felt had 'low self-esteem' He is held at the Baltimore City Detention Center, awaiting trial on a charge of attempted murder. 'The inmates literally took over ""the asylum,"" and the detention centers became safe havens for BGF,' FBI Special Agent in Charge Stephen Vogt said. White, 36, allegedly fathered five . children with the four female guards, who were identified as Jennifer . Owens, 31, Katera Stevenson, 24, Chania Brooks, 27, and Tiffany Linder, . 27. The request for search warrants to allow . investigators to visit the homes of the female guards says that the . prisoners, many of whom were connected to the Black Guerrilla Family . gang, chose their targets strategically. 'The inmates literally took over ¿the asylum,¿ and the detention centers became safe havens for BGF,' FBI Special Agent in Charge Stephen Vogt said . The officers that they focused on were ones that they believed had 'low self-esteem and insecurities'. The Washington Post reports that two of the officers in question got tattoos of White's name, one on one officer's neck and the second officer on her wrist. The indictment claims the gang ran the scheme from inside the detention center and charges gang members and corrections officers with conspiracy, drug possession and distribution and money laundering. A telephone call seeking comment from White's attorney was not immediately returned Tuesday. The Washington Post reports that during a wiretapped cellphone call made by White in January, he told a friend: 'This is my jail. You understand that? I’m dead serious. I make every final call in this jail.' The guards helped the gang leaders smuggle cell phones and drugs into the prison. The arrangement was apparently profitable: one gang leader bought two luxury cars- a BMW and a Mercedes- with the profits from his contraband sales within the prison. He then allowed some of the officers to drive the cars in return for their cooperation. 'Correctional officers were in bed with BGF inmates,' Maryland U.S. Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein said. 'We need to be able to rely on people within law enforcement — to make sure they are on our side.'","Federal investigators say 13 female guards were in on the scheme at Baltimore City Detention Center .

"A town has filed suit against a group that walks around refilled the parking meters of strangers in an activity they call Robin Hooding. Named for the classic do-gooder and their town of residence, Keene, New Hampsire, members of 'Robin Hood of Keene' are accused of harassing the city’s parking enforcement officers in a civil suit filed May 2. The group denies this, however. They say the city is just mad because of lost revenue from parking tickets. Not too keen: The Robin Hoods of Keene New Hampshire are being sued by their town for feeding expired meters and harassing parking officers . When the group, which is also goes by Robin Hood and His Merry Men, finds an expired meter they refill it with change and then place a card notifying the car’s own what has happened. ‘Your meter expired,’ read the notes. ‘However, we saved you from the king’s tariffs, Robin Hood and his Merry Men. Please consider paying it forward.’ Also on the note is an address where those inclined can send money to the ‘Robin Hooders.’ The city of Keene’s lawsuit alleges the group has ‘regularly, repeatedly, and intentionally taunted, interfered with, harassed, and intimidated the PEOs [parking enforcement officers] in the performance of their employment.’ Generous? The leaves a signature note telling drivers what has happened. 'Your meter expired,' it begins. The suit names six members of the group and formally requests the court bar them from coming within 50 feet of the PEOs while they are on duty. ‘Besides following me,’ writes PEO Linda Desruisseaux in the suit, ‘crowding around me, making video recordings of my activities, and placing coins in expired meters to prevent me from writing tickets, these individuals repeatedly taunt and harass me.’ The Robin Hooders, of course, disagree. Harassing? The Robin Hoods' videos show them following and interacting with parking officers as well as filling expired meters . Suit: The group stalks downtown Keene in one of its videos. The City of Keene is suing to keep the group's members at least 50 feet away from on-duty parking officers at all times . ‘Robin Hooding is about saving people from getting parking tickets,’ writes member James Cleaveland (aka James Robin Hood) on a website associated with the group called FreeKeene.com. ‘The city has resorted to a civil case against me and others instead of a criminal one providing more evidence that no criminal actions were committed.’ Cleaveland claims the group has stopped the city from issuing 4,000 tickets. Youtube videos of the group’s activities posted show members approaching and speaking to several parking officers. In most cases the officers try to avoid or ignore the Robin Hooders.","Robin Hood and his Merry Men appear alive and well in Keene, New Hampshire but city officials hope to put a stop to their rapscallion ways ."

Police say a homeless man set the 63-year-old California man on fire outside a 7-Eleven store by throwing a flammable substance inside the man's parked SUV. The unidentified victim is said to have walked past the panhandler as he requested money, according to ABC. As he got in the car, the man threw a flammable liquid into the vehicle and set it alight.

"A shocking video that appears to show three gay men being harassed by New York police officers has sparked outrage in the city. The three-minute long clip shows a trio of men being shouted at police, before one is allegedly put into a police car and driven away. The officers and the men exchange a stream of shouts and abuse at each other, apparently prompted by officers accusing one of the group of urinating outside police property. Late night row: A man and an officer can be seen confronting each other during the incident . The incident was partially caught on camera by one of of the roommates of Josh Williams, who claims he was badly injured during the row .

"A group of Russian MPs have called for former leader Mikhail Gorbachev to be prosecuted fro the breakup of the Soviet Union 23 years ago . Russian MPs are making an extraordinary bid to have Mikhail Gorbachev prosecuted for the 'illegal' collapse of the Soviet Union more than two decades ago. They are calling for a criminal probe into the last leader of the USSR, a man widely respected around the world for ending the Cold War. One MP in Vladimir Putin's United Russia Party even branded 83-year-old Gorbachev a 'US spy' for the break-up of the Communist state 23 years ago. He also argued that the legal move would offer succour to pro-Moscow groups in other states seeking to revert to Kremlin rule. Gorbachev today called the MPs' move 'sheer stupidity', adding: 'These people just do not have shame. 'I do not react to such statements. I am doing my business and taking care of my health.' The legal demand from a multi-party group in the Russian parliament comes after Moscow has annexed its former territory of Crimea including naval port Sevastopol, and amid fears that its massing troops could lead to a new land grab in ex-Soviet neighbour Ukraine. The group has petitioned Russian prosecutor general Yury Chaika with a view to criminal cases against those responsible for allowing the Baltic States of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to secure independence and the later break-up of the remaining republics of the USSR. 'The MPs are hoping for opening criminal cases in future based on results of this prosecutor's investigation, one of such cases would be against the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev,' reported Russian daily paper Izvestia. MP Evgeniy Fedorov, of United Russia who claims Gorbachev is currently in Germany, said: 'We need a full and reliable legal analysis of the event in 1991. We must consider the fact of deliberate liquidation of power institutions.' Gorbachev (pictured on a visit to Downing Street in 1991) is widely credited with ending the Cold War. His resignation on Christmas Day 1991 symbolised the decision to break up the Soviet Union . 'I do not think Germany will extradite him if the investigation proves his guilt in the collapse of the country and his status of a US spy, according to which he was forming all his policy in those days.' The legal probe was needed to 'draw the right historic and political picture which would let us make straight conclusions. And after all, it would encourage national liberation movements in former Soviet territories.' Liberal Democrat MP Mikhail Dyagterev said: 'So far there has been no legal opinion on the fact of tearing states to pieces. But everything supports the idea that it was a pre-planned action, and those guilty must be made responsible, including Gorbachev. 'We are still experiencing the consequences of the event in 1991. People in Kiev are dying and will keep dying because those in the Kremlin many years ago have decided to break down the country.' The MPs, including Communists, complained that the decision to end the Soviet Union - symbolised by Gorbachev's resignation on Christmas Day 1991 - was taken despite a referendum which opposed a break-up. Current Russian President Vladimir Putin (pictured talking to Gorbachev in 2004) has called the breakup of the Union the 'greatest geopolitical tragedy of the 20th century' The latest move appears to be inspired by Putin's view that 'the collapse of the Soviet Union was a major geopolitical disaster of the century. As for the Russian nation, it became a genuine drama. 'Tens of millions of our co-citizens and co-patriots found themselves outside Russian territory. Moreover, the epidemic of disintegration infected Russia itself.' NATO General Secretary Anders Fogh Rasmussen has today told Russia to withdraw its troops from the Ukrainian border . Marina Bobkova, the head of Historic Knowledge Centre of the History Institute of Russian Academy of Science, said the matter needed a judicial decision. 'Putin was the first to give the right evaluation of this event. He called it the largest geopolitical catastrophe. 'All of us can have different opinions but we cannot argue with this statement. It was an unprecedented case - the state liquidated itself. 'It is good that this matter is raised again. And lawyers should deal with it, not politicians or historians. She stated: 'Many participants of those days events are peacefully living at the territory of Russia and in other countries now. 'If their guilt is proved by evidence, I think it is fair to initiate sanctions against them.' Gorbachev claimed the MPs wanted 'to PR themselves', arguing: 'The appeal is not well thought through, and from the view of historic facts - it is absolute groundless.' Protesters in eastern Ukraine have this week called on Putin to intervene to guarantee their rights, despite warnings from NATO of further sanctions if they intervene. NATO General Secretary Anders Fogh Rasmussen said today that any further military action by Russia would lead to grave consequences and severe economic sanctions. He said: 'From Prague, I have this message to Russia: You have a choice to stop blaming others for your own actions, to stop massing your troops, to stop escalating this crisis and start engaging in a genuine dialogue. 'If Russia is serious about a dialogue, the first step should be to pull back its troops.' Russia has roughly 40,000 troops stationed along the Ukrainian border and has threatened to act to protect its citizens inside the country. today pro-Russian activists have been demonstrating in the eastern city of Luhansk . Ukrainian leaders claim the trouble in its Russian-speaking regions has been fomented by Moscow's secret services. Russia, the United States, Ukraine and the European Union will hold talks next Thursday in Geneva to try to negotiate an end to the crisis in Ukraine, EU diplomats said on Thursday. Rasmussen said earlier this week NATO was reviewing a 1997 co-operation agreement with Russia and subsequent Rome declaration of 2002 that prevented NATO setting up bases in eastern and central Europe .","Soviet Union was dismantled under leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev .

The prisoners had been mistreated, Marri said, adding that police had also seized a truck filled with ammunition and weapons at the premises. Khetran told local reporters the arrests were politically motivated and that it was illegal for police to enter his house. Khetran, whose wife is also a politician, is an MP for Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, a conservative religious party, and a former provincial minister for special education.

"Boston bomb suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev faces charges that could lead to the death penalty.

Investigators plan to first question him . without informing him of his legal rights to remain silent and have an . attorney present.

Critical: Tsarnaev, who was arrested Friday night, remains in critical condition under heavy guard after he was apprehended in Watertown . The High-Value Detainee Interrogation . Team was set up in 2009 to extract information from suspects as quickly . as possible after their capture when they are at their most vulnerable. Several Republican lawmakers on Saturday criticised the administration's approach because they said it would afford Tsarnaev more rights than he deserves. The federal public defender for Massachusetts called for the quick appointment of a lawyer to represent Tsarnaev because of serious issues involving his interrogation in the absence of a lawyer. Prosecution of Tsarnaev in federal court would seem a natural course for an administration that previously won a life sentence against Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab of Nigeria for trying to blow up a packed jetliner using a bomb sewn into his underwear on Christmas Day 2009. Death penalty? The Obama administration has a range of legal options in the Boston Marathon bombings, and they could include seeking the death penalty against the 19-year-old suspect in the case . Instead of reading Tsarnaev his Miranda rights, prosecutors planned to invoke a public safety exception created by the need to protect police and the public from immediate danger . The administration also will put . Osama bin Laden's son-in-law on trial in January on charges that he . conspired to kill Americans in his role as al-Qaida's chief spokesman. As . a U.S. citizen, Tsarnaev could not be tried by a military commission . under current law; the only option for prosecuting an American is in . civilian courts. A federal official with knowledge of the case said Tsarnaev was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in September 2012. The official was not authorized to speak publicly about details of the case and requested anonymity. Tsarnaev . was under armed guard at a Boston hospital and was reported in serious . condition and unable to be interrogated Saturday. He has yet to be charged but prosecutors appear to have no shortage of federal laws at their disposal. The . most serious charge would be the use of a weapon of mass destruction to . kill people, which carries a possible death sentence. Three people died in the twin explosions in Boston and more than 180 were injured. Massachusetts does not have the death penalty, and it remains to be seen whether the administration would try to persuade a jury to sentence Tsarnaev to death. Outspoken: Sens. John McCain, R-Arizona, and . Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, are part of a group of four lawmakers . demanding not to read the teenager his Miranda rights . The state could try to bring charges . against him, including for the death of Sean Collier, the Massachusetts . Institute of Technology police officer who authorities say was killed by . Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan. An early question that arose after Tsarnaev's capture on Friday was how to conduct his initial interrogation. The administration said it would not immediately inform him of legal protections known as the Miranda rights. Instead, . prosecutors planned to invoke a public safety exception created by the . need to protect police and the public from immediate danger. The . American Civil Liberties Union's executive director, Anthony Romero, . said the exception applies only when there's a continued threat to . public safety, like whether there is imminent danger from other bombs, . and is ‘not an open-ended exception’ to the Miranda rule. The . federal public defender for Massachusetts, Miriam Conrad, said her . office expects to represent Tsarnaev after he is charged and that he . needs a lawyer appointed as soon as possible because there are ‘serious . issues regarding possible interrogation.’ But several congressional Republicans said Tsarnaev's rights should be even more restricted than the administration intends. ‘I . am disappointed that it appears this administration is once again . relying on Miranda's public safety exception to gather intelligence . which only allows at best a 48-hour waiting period that may expire since . the suspect has been critically wounded,’ Senator Saxby Chambliss of . Georgia, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said . in a statement hours after Tsarnaev was captured. Joint statement: Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New . Hampshire, left, as well as Rep. Peter King, New York, right, both . signed the statement saying there were valuable things that the suspect . could reveal . Chambliss' concerns were echoed by Senators John McCain, R-Ariz., Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., as well as Representative Peter King, R-N.Y. ‘A decision to not read Miranda rights to the suspect was sound and in our national security interests,’ the four said in a statement. ‘However, we have concerns that limiting this investigation to 48 hours and exclusively relying on the public safety exception to Miranda, could very well be a national security mistake. It could severely limit our ability to gather critical information about future attacks from this suspect.’ But Representative Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a former federal prosecutor and member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the administration should ignore ‘hasty calls to treat the suspect as an enemy combatant.’ ‘This is not a foreign national caught on an enemy battlefield, but an American citizen arrested on American soil,’ Schiff said. ‘The Justice Department has demonstrated a far greater ability to successfully prosecute suspected terrorists in federal courts than the military commissions have thus far been able to show. Nothing must be done to compromise the public safety, the ability of prosecutors to seek justice for the victims or our constitutional principles.’ While the Republicans asserted that Tsarnaev can be held as an enemy combatant, the Supreme Court has never resolved whether citizens or foreign nationals arrested on U.S. soil can be held by the military, as opposed to civilian authorities. The court twice was prepared to take up that question in recent years, once while George W. Bush was president and once since Barack Obama became took office. Both times, the administration moved the suspected terrorists, U.S. citizen Jose Padilla and graduate student Ali al-Marri, from a military brig to civilian confinement to head off the high court case.

"A Texas Army veteran is being questioned . in connection with poison letters sent to President Obama and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg after his wife found a container in their refrigerator filled with what appeared to be ricin. The man, who neighbors identified to KSLA as father-of-five Nathaniel Richardson, is a civilian employee of the Department of Defense who works at the Red River Army Depot. Sources said he is being treated as a person of interest. His wife, actress Shannon Glass, told officers that as well as the container in the fridge, she also found internet searches related to ricin production, Obama and Bloomberg on their computer. The development comes two days after it emerged that Bloomberg and his anti-gun group were sent two ricin-laced letters. On Thursday, it was revealed that another, identical letter was sent to Obama.

Questions: A man identified by neighbors as Nathaniel Richardson is being questioned in connection to ricin-laced letters sent to Mayor Bloomberg after his wife, right, found a suspicious liquid in their fridge . Couple: His wife also allegedly found searches for Obama, Bloomberg and ricin production on their computer . Richardson, 37, was taken into police custody but has not been arrested. He is not considered a suspect at this time, reports the New York Post. Neighbors said he worked at the Red River Army Depot, which was once used as an ammunition storage facility, and which now repairs Humvees and other military vehicles. His wife Shannon, 35, is a model and actress who has had small roles in The Vampire Diaries and The Walking Dead. She is pregnant with her sixth child.

Sources said that Richardson has connections to Shreveport. The city's postal center handles mail from Louisiana, Texas and Arkansas, KSLA reported. The envelope that contained the ricin-tainted letter sent to Mayor Michael Bloomberg has been pictured for the first time, with some of the text of the letter pictured inset . Scene: Authorities are seen outside the home where Shannon and Nathan Richardson live on Friday . One of the ricin-tainted letters sent to Bloomberg has been pictured. It reads: . 'You will have to kill me and my family before you get my guns. 'Anyone . wants to come to my house will be shot in the face. 'The right to bear . arms is my constitutional God-given right and I will exercise that right . 'til the day I die. 'What's in this letter is nothing compared to what I've got planned for you.' The typed threat in the letter, . splattered with the poisonous substance, is also shown. It tells the . pro-gun control mayor: 'You will have to kill me and my family before . you get my guns. 'What's in this letter is nothing compared to what I've got planned for you.' The letter sent to President Obama contained the same chilling text, sources said on Thursday. The letter to the president was received at a mail screening facility and did not reach the White House, law enforcement sources told NBC4. One of the letters sent to Bloomberg was retrieved at the City Hall, and the second arrived at the headquarters of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which Bloomberg . operates and personally finances. They contained threats warning him to . stay away from the gun laws debate, authorities said. NYPD officials said . the threatening letters were opened on Friday in New York at the . city's mail facility and on Sunday in Washington at the headquarters of . the nonprofit. Three . members of the NYPD fell ill after being exposed to the letters, which . contained a 'pink, orange oily substance', authorities said. Their . symptoms have since subsided. In custody: A KSLA video shows Mrs Richardson being driven away from her home by police on May 30th for questioning . Search: Authorities are seen taking computers away from the New Boston home on Thursday night . Probe: Mrs Richardson contacted authorities after finding the substance in a Tupperware in her fridge . Protection: Authorities search the home, but no arrests have yet been made in the case . Bloomberg, speaking Friday on his weekly WOR Radio show, shrugged off any specter of danger. 'There's always threats, . unfortunately. That comes with the job,' he said. 'I trust the police . department and I feel perfectly safe. I've got more danger from . lightning than from anything else and I'll go about my business.' On Wednesday, he said it would not scare him away from . engaging in the debate over gun laws. 'There's 12,000 people that are going . to get killed this year with guns and 19,000 that are going to commit . suicide with guns, and we're not going to walk away from those efforts,' he said. 'And I know I . speak for all of the close to 1,000 mayors,' in Mayors Against Illegal . Guns, he said. 'This is a scourge on the country that we just have to . make sure that we get under control and eliminate.' Targeted: Mayor Michael Bloomberg, pictured at the Real Estate Board of New York on May 30th, was sent two letters laced with the poison ricin. The attack left three members of the NYPD ill . Under threat? A threatening letter sent to President Barack Obama is being tested for ricin after New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was sent two similar letters laced with the poison . Ricin is a poison found naturally in castor beans. The beans can be safely made in to castor oil, but ricin is a part of the waste 'mash' from the oil production. It can be made into a powder, a mist or a pellet and is poisonous if inhaled, injected, or ingested. Chewing the beans can also release the harmful substance. For ricin to poison people, it would have to be a deliberate act, according to the CDC. The only accidental injuries could come through ingesting castor beans. Ricin gets inside the cells of a person’s body and prevents the cells from making proteins they need. Without the proteins, cells die. It can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal and circulatory symptoms and can lead to death 36 to 72 hours after exposure. In 1978, Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian writer and journalist living in London, died after he was attacked by a man with an umbrella which had been rigged to inject a poison ricin pellet under Markov's skin. It is not yet known why it took the FBI and the NYPD five days to announce the discovery. The matter is being investigated by . the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force which said that the letter sent to . Manhattan for billionaire Bloomberg arrived at 100 Gold Street - the . home of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. Both . the New York and Washington D.C. notes were addressed to Bloomberg and . contained threats referencing the debate on gun laws. The second letter to the mayor was . opened by Mark Glaze, director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, who has . not been reported to have fallen ill. The NYPD confirmed preliminary testing indicated the presence of ricin. 'The FBI has an investigation ongoing and so things like the exact . wording and the postmarks, etc. we’re not going to disclose,' NYPD . deputy commissioner Paul Browne told WCBS 880. 'It was a pink-orange . oily substance that subsequently, in the preliminary tests, indicate the . presence of ricin.' Ricin is a poison found naturally in castor beans. It's not clear if the letters were related to other threatening, ricin-laced letters sent to other lawmakers recently. Authorities are now 'in the process of searching to determine if there may be additional letters,' according to the statement. Destination: The letter containing ricin addressed to New York City Mayor Bloomberg arrived here at 100 Gold Street - it was also where three members of the NYPD were exposed to the poison . Mayor . Bloomberg is an outspoken critic of current gun laws and has campaigned . nationally and on Capitol Hill for stricter gun legislation - using his . own considerable wealth to fund commercials. The . confirmation of ricin present in both letters came through on Wednesday . from the National Bioforensic Analysis Center in Maryland. Ricin symptoms depend on the amount . of exposure and dose received, but within a few hours lead to cough, . fever, nausea, tightness in the chest and heavy breathing. Death follows through fluid build up in the lungs. Deadly: This stock picture shows a sample of deadly ricin - which kills through causing a lethal build up of fluid on the lungs . Several . ricin-laced letters have been sent to U.S. politicians over the past . few months - including one addressed to President Obama in mid-April.

Mississippi man, James Everett Duschke stands accused of making the . poison ricin and sending those letters - which also went to Senator . Roger Wicker and a Mississippi judge.

"Bernie Madoff's last surviving son, who died last week, left his $16 million fortune to both his estranged wife and his newer fiancee, Manhattan court documents revealed Thursday. The will of Andrew Madoff, who succumbed to cancer last Wednesday, provides that his legal wife Deborah West will get one third of his assets while Caroline Hooper--whom he described as a 'fiancee'--will get $50,000 per month through a trust. The 48-year-old financier also provided trusts for his two children, who'll also receive all Madoff's personal property. Scroll down for video . Revealed: The late Andrew Madoff left his fiancee Catherine Hooper a trust of $50,000 per month in the Bernie Madoff's son's will revealed Thursday . Everyone gets a piece: Andrew Madoff's estranged wife Deborah West (right) was left one-third of the millionaire financier's estate. Their children, including daughter Emily Madoff (left) will receive trusts and all of Madoff's personal property . 'I request my executor to pay to Catherine Hooper, so long as she is living, the sum of $50,000 on the first day of each month, commencing 30 days after the admission of this will to probate, for her support until the administration of my estate is completed,' reads the July 8 will, obtained by the New York Daily News. For those who know the back-story between Madoff and his wife West, her inclusion in the will may come as a surprise. West, the mother of Madoff's children and his wife at the time for around 16 years, filed for divorce the same day her father-in-law was arrested in December 2008. Hooper moved in with Andy just three days after the senior Madoff's arrest. It was all too much: Andrew Madoff suffered from multiple bouts with a rare lymphoma and after an initial remission, he would blame his father for the cancer's return . Andrew Madoff and his brother, Mark Madoff, worked on the legitimate trading side of their father's Manhattan firm, two floors removed from the private investment business where Bernard Madoff carried out his $65 billion Ponzi scheme over several decades. Bernard Madoff, 76, was arrested in December 2008. He pleaded guilty to fraud charges months later and is serving a 150-year sentence at a federal prison in North Carolina. Two years after the father's arrest, Mark Madoff hanged himself in his Manhattan loft apartment as his 2-year-old son slept in another room. 'One way to think of this is the scandal and everything that happened killed my brother very quickly,' Andrew Madoff told People magazine last year. 'And it's killing me slowly.' Andrew Madoff was diagnosed with the rare form of cancer in 2003 but went into remission. He blamed the relapse on the stress of living with his father's scam. The disease returned in October 2012, and he told People magazine he felt 'blindsided.' Andrew Madoff had served as the chairman of the Lymphoma Research Foundation's board of directors until his father's scheme was revealed. Flumenbaum said Andrew Madoff had 'lost his courageous battle' with the disease. He said funeral arrangements will be private. The death came as authorities continue to investigate what role, if any, close family members and others linked to the Madoff business had in the fraud. Sentencings are scheduled in several weeks for five former high-level Madoff firm employees convicted of helping carry out the fraud by conspiring to defraud clients and falsifying books and records. While heading up Madoff Energy, an entity of his father's firm, Andy shared in more than $31 million in so-called 'loans' doled out to family members by his crooked father, seemingly another effort to hide the billions looted from trusting investors. As a veteran of the Madoff firm told me for my 2009 book, the family had 'so much money coming in and out of their accounts they needed five people to keep track of it. There was a Disneyland atmosphere. Money meant nothing to the Madoffs.' In an interview with People Magazine, Andy Madoff (center) pleaded his innocence and declared he felt 'horrible for the people whose lives have been destroyed by my father's crimes.' Mark Madoff (left) killed himself in 2010. At rigth is patriarch Bernie Madoff . Carolina Hooper was once a covergirl for Fish & Fly magazine. She moved in with Andrew Madoff just days after his wife announced her plans to divorce Madoff . The Madoff veteran recalled the bonuses and gifts that were doled out around the holidays by.Andy's always coiffed and catered to mother, Ruth. 'We used to call it 'Ruth's Twelve Days of Christmas.' Beginning in the early '90s she'd spend at least $150,000 a day, give or take, during the holidays, buying gifts and who knows what else.' When Bernie's accountant pleaded guilty to fraud in the case last July, Andy and Mark Madoff were named by prosecutors as 'co-conspirators,' according to news accounts. Andy and other members of the family had been using the ill-gotten funds from the scheme as their 'personal piggy bank,' according to the court-appointed trustee given the mammoth job of liquidating the Madoff business, a task that included seeking a whopping $153 million from the estates of the Madoff brothers, Andy and Mark. In an interview with People Magazine, Andy Madoff pleaded his innocence and declared he felt 'horrible for the people whose lives have been destroyed by my father's crimes.'

"Almost 30-years-ago, William Potts hijacked a passenger airliner bound for Miami to fly him to Cuba where the Black Panther hoped he would be welcomed with open arms by fellow Marxist revolutionaries. Instead, the New York native was sentenced to 15-years hard labor by Fidel Castro's government and now the man described as the 'homesick hijacker' wants to return to the United States to apologize to the people who he terrorized back in 1984. However, it seems the U.S. government wants nothing to do with the man who still considers himself a revolutionary and who also believes his time in Cuban prison should override the indictment he would surely face back in America for airplane hijacking. Scroll Down for Video . William Potts calls himself the 'Homesick Hijacker': Almost 25 years ago, he smuggled a pistol onto a commercial flight, diverted the plane to Havana, and spent 13 1/2 years in a Cuban prison for air piracy . In 1984, Potts' radical political ideology left him convinced he needed to leave the United States for Cuba - but then, as now, American citizen's travel to the Caribbean island was limited because the U.S. government considers Cuba a sponsor of terrorism. Putting his plan into action, Potts disguised a .25-caliber pistol inside a fake cast in his arm and walked through security at Newark Airport. As the plane took off, Potts entered the bathroom and changed into his 'Black Panther costume' of dark clothes and combat boots - walking out with the pistol in his hand. Potts pushed his call button and gave the flight attendant a note saying he had two accomplices aboard with explosives. He now says he told the lie to 'avoid confrontations.' Praying: In March 1984, on a Miami-bound Piedmont Airlines flight that originated in Newark, N.J., Potts pushed his call button and gave the flight attendant a note saying he had two accomplices aboard with explosives . He claimed to be Lt. Spartacus, a soldier in the Black Liberation Army. But now he says he was never actually a formal member of the violent Marxist group, and that he knew the hijacking would be nonviolent. Cuban leader Fidel Castro caused Potts to become so infatuated with Cuba's communist way of life that he was willing to hijack a plane, even though he spoke no Spanish, knew no one on the island and expected to go to prison . He was so infatuated with Cuba's communist way of life that he was willing to hijack a plane, even though he spoke no Spanish and knew no one on the island. While the pilot tried to talk him around, Potts used his weapon to his advantage. 'I had to be forceful with him,' Potts remembered during an interview with CNN. 'I tell him, if we don't go to Cuba, this plane is going down. We are going to hell or Cuba.' As the plane came into land hours later, Potts said that he checked out the window for McDonald's and Coca Cola signs to make sure he was definitely about to set foot in the Communist country. However, on landing, he ended up in the fearsome Combinado del Este prison just outside Havana. Now 55, he argues he has paid his debt — and that prison time-served in Cuba should allow him to head back to America a free man. Incredibly, authorities in Cuba had offered to let him return with the plane at the time - but he believed his revolutionary brothers would treat him well - even as his sentence for air piracy was read out. 'I thought I had won the case, and they gave me 15 years,' Potts said to CNN, recalling his brief court proceedings in Cuba. 'I didn't even know what 15 was in Spanish. And they said 'quince.' I said, what is 'quince?' and my translator said 15 years. 'And I said, '15 years for who?' And they said, '15 years for you.' Potts served 13-and-half years. Communist Hangover: Cuba has struggled to develop since Fidel Castro's revolution in the 1950s . He still faces an indictment for air piracy in Florida federal district court that could carry a 20-year prison sentence. Potts married twice since his release and has two daughters from his second marriage called Ntann, 7, and Assata Shakur, 11, named after Assata Shakur, aunt of slain rapper Tupac Shakur. A black separatist, she was sentenced to life imprisonment for the 1973 killing of a New Jersey police officer and had ties to former Weather Underground radical Bill Ayers, who became a campaign issue for President Obama in 2008 because he and Ayers served on the same Chicago community board. Now, Potts works on a farm eeking out a meagre existence, trying to find a way home. He told CNN that raising his daughters made him realize that they needed to see the country of his birth and to see their American family. His four year campaign to return home saw him write to President Obama in 2009, to request a pardon for the hijacking - however, he heard nothing back. Then he wrote to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami to request a plea deal for the outstanding charges - again he heard nothing back. 'I regret taking the plane and putting those people's lives in jeopardy,' he said to CNN. 'I didn't have that perspective at the time, but I have it now and will have it until the day I die. I would have been responsible for all those people dying.' William Potts sits in his home during an interview with Associated Press in Havana, in 2008.  In 1984, Potts hijacked a commercial flight to Miami, diverted it to Havana and spent nearly 14 years in a Cuban prison for air piracy . In the meantime, his daughter's were handed U.S. citizenship and passports and returned to live his relatives in December, while Potts still waits for news from the U.S. Attorney's office in Miami. The issue of why his own government will not respond to Potts dates back to the tensions that have existed between the United States and Cuba since Fidel Castro's revolution in 1958. In the 1960s and early '70s, there were dozens of American hijackings to Cuba — so many that they became fodder for standup comedians. As a way of discouraging them, both sides signed a 1971 agreement under which each government agreed to prosecute hijackers or return them to the other country. Still, periodic tensions with Washington often pushed Cuba to suspend the deal, and many fugitives reaching Cuba got asylum — bank robbery suspects, Puerto Rican independence fighters, Black Panthers leaders such as Eldridge Cleaver. They were treated as political refugees — a key reason why the U.S. still labels Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism. Revolutionary Times: Armed members of the Black Panther Party leave the Capitol in Sacramento May 2nd, 1967 . The U.S. has no extradition treaty with this country, and in some ways, they have become wanted Americans whom no one is after. Washington can't even provide updated information on who is believed to be in Cuba, referring The Associated Press to an outdated FBI list of 78 U.S. fugitives — at least four of whom are known to be dead. Cuba stopped giving new arrivals sanctuary in 2006, so far returning four wanted Americans who recently had fled to avoid prosecution. But some famous ones are thought to remain, such as Assata Shakur and Victor Gerena, a Puerto Rican separatist. He is still on the FBI's 'Ten Most Wanted' fugitive list for a 1983 armed robbery of an armored car company in Connecticut. Shakur escaped from prison and made it to Cuba. Though she remains underground, Potts says he ran into her at a Havana book fair last year. Gerena and Shakur still have $1 million bounties for their arrest. As recently as 2005, Fidel Castro said U.S. racism made Shakur a 'true political prisoner.'","William Potts calls himself the 'Homesick Hijacker'

"A football press conference is not the usual place to witness a moment of heartfelt compassion. Yet Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho stunned onlookers when he halted one of his pre-match briefings to welcome back ITV journalist Rags Martel. Rags had recently recovered from thyroid cancer, and the press conference in January was his first  day back at work. Fighting on: ITV sports journalist Rags Martel, 37, from London, was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in August 2013, after a friend spotted a lump on his neck . Mourinho was delighted to see him again, and quickly made his way  out from behind his desk to shake hands with the sports reporter while asking him: ‘All good?’ ‘All good,’ replied Rags, 37, before adding: ‘It’s good to see you back,’  in reference to the Portuguese manager’s return to the Premier League club during the summer. Speaking today for the first time about his illness and his subsequent return to health, Rags explains how the pair had become acquainted months earlier when he asked Mourinho a series of difficult questions at a previous press conference. During Rags’s recuperation, Mourinho sent him a get-well card saying: ‘I miss a difficult question.’ The journalist reveals: ‘Being welcomed back by Mourinho was  a sweet moment, and as I’m a Chelsea supporter, when I got the card  I said, “This is almost worth getting cancer for.” I was being ironic, of course.’ He also found comfort in the  words of fellow sports reporter Clare Balding, who underwent surgery for the same kind of cancer in 2009. Letting them know: Rags Martell told his colleagues, and the world, that he was suffering from thyroid cancer via social media . ‘I heard her on Desert Island Discs discussing her own thyroid cancer,’ he explains. ‘I welled up and cried. She was talking about her treatment – which was very similar to mine – and the worry  of who you tell. ‘It happened so fast with me I didn’t have time to think. You’re told you have cancer, you get a date for the operation, and then the radiotherapy. Hearing Clare Balding on the radio was the first  time I had heard someone talking about surviving it and it struck a nerve with me. ‘I’ve never met her but I’ve met other people who have suddenly showed me their own surgery scars. That’s the thing with cancer – one in three of us will get it. I was perhaps slightly younger than most but it’s on the cards for a lot of us.’ Rags was diagnosed in August 2013. He says: ‘I was at a railway station early one morning when a friend of mine spotted the lump by the right side of my Adam’s apple and asked, “What’s that?” ‘I had never noticed it before but I saw a doctor straight away and he said it had been growing for many months. It baffles me that I didn’t spot it earlier because the lump  was the size of a small plum, but I suppose you don’t look at that part of your neck much. ‘The GP seemed concerned. He said it could be a cyst and sent me  to hospital for tests.’ However, a week later Rags was told his lump was cancerous and that he needed surgery to remove his thyroid. The butterfly-shaped gland is located in the neck, sitting around the trachea and just below the voice box. It is responsible for producing the hormone thyroxine, which regulates the body’s metabolism – including how fast the heart beats and how much sleep we need. Once the gland is removed, patients have to take a synthetic form of the hormone in a daily drug dose. ‘I was in disbelief,’ says Rags of his initial diagnosis. ‘The bad thing is you turn to Google for answers and you end up assuming the worst will happen. ‘I had a type of thyroid cancer which has a 90 per cent survival rate – but that still means one in ten people will die.’ Rags, who lives with his partner, fellow TV reporter Ria Chatterjee, says his first concern was how to tell his 11-year-old daughter Roxie, his child from a previous relationship. ‘I was very open with her,’ he says. ‘I showed her the lump and told her it was something called cancer. There was a lot of not knowing what was going to happen –  I didn’t want to worry her but I wanted to be honest with her too.  I had that worry of, “Will I leave my daughter without a father?” ’ Rags had surgery to remove the cancerous lump in his neck on October 14 last year. ‘Basically they slit my throat at the base of my neck,’ he says cheerfully. ‘I now have a 3in scar. ‘They removed my entire thyroid in an operation lasting about 90 minutes. I felt pretty rotten when I came around – very nauseous, and doped up on morphine – but then  felt better hour by hour.’ After three days in hospital, he went home and he says he felt completely recovered about three weeks later. Show of support: When Rags returned to his job as a sports reporter for ITV, Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho stunned onlookers when he halted one of his pre-match briefings to welcome him back . However, one of his big concerns was . how to tell friends and colleagues he had cancer. ‘You get those emails . at work saying, “Hi, I’ve had a baby,” but it didn’t seem right to do it . about cancer,’ he says. Instead, . while he was in his hospital bed recovering from surgery, Rags took a . picture of himself and uploaded it to social media  site Instagram. ‘It . got the job done but I was probably a bit out of it on painkilling . medication at the time and didn’t consider what I was doing. I was . fortunate enough to receive a lot  of supportive comments.’ As a follow-up to the surgery, Rags then received iodine radiotherapy treatment. Professor Christopher Nutting, consultant clinical oncologist at the Royal Marsden Hospital, who treated him, explains: ‘The thyroid gland absorbs iodine which you get from eating seafood and then converts it into thyroxin, which regulates body function. ‘By giving the patient a radioactive type of iodine in the form of a tablet, if there are any thyroid cancer cells left after surgery, they will absorb the radiation and die. ‘No other organ in the body is interested in iodine so it’s an effective targeted treatment.’ Rags needed only one dose of iodine treatment, although sometimes patients need more. An MRI scan is also given to see if the  cancer has spread to other parts  of the body. He took the tablet in an isolated room in a London clinic and remained there for 24 hours as patients are left radioactive afterwards. ‘Then staff said I could go home but not to be in contact with children or pregnant women, because I was technically radioactive,’ he adds. Rags returned to work in January, when he had that encounter with Mourinho, and is upbeat about the future. The prognosis for those who have been effectively treated for differentiated thyroid cancer is good – but they will need to be tested for the rest of their lives as there is a possibility the cancer will recur. ‘I have seen a patient where it has returned after 20 years but that’s rare,’ says Prof Nutting. ‘It’s a cancer that can be cured but may still show up further down the line, and for that reason patients need lifelong follow-up.’ Rags is still getting used to his new medication. At first his dosage needed to be adjusted as he was getting by on just three hours’ sleep a night. ‘I still think it’s all going  to be over but then I realise I’ll be  on those pills until the day I die. I forgot to take them one morning recently and was I falling asleep  by midday.’ Thyroid cancer has changed his outlook on life. ‘I’m more spontaneous now,’ he admits. ‘I’d always wanted to go sky-diving so I’ll do that soon. I don’t want to delay things because I’ve realised I’m not going to be here for ever. ‘Cancer is a way of telling you you’re not immortal and your body can give up on you and you will die. It’s given me a new appreciation of life. You just want to live life and tell your family and friends how much you love them. I have a more positive outlook now.’","Rags Martel, 37, was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in August last year .

"Ronny Deila has admitted he would prefer to have Gary Mackay-Steven on board before the end of the month to boost Celtic’s title challenge. The Parkhead boss confirmed he hopes the Dundee United winger will soon agree to a pre-contract that would initially secure a summer switch to Glasgow. If that happens, then Deila is set to ask chief executive Peter Lawwell to try to strike a deal with United —who are thought to be seeking a £250,000 fee — that would bring forward the move. Dundee United winger Gary Mackay-Steven is expected to sign a pre-contract agreement with Celtc . The 24-year-old scores against Hamilton during a Scottish Premiership match . ‘That is the best situation but again it’s about money,’ said Deila. ‘First he has to say yes. ‘I think that’s the way you have to do it. If you don’t know if the players wants it then it’s harder to agree between the clubs. ‘When you have the opportunity, you go for the player and see what can be arranged.’ Sheffield United are also keen on Mackay-Steven and have seen a bid in the region of £100,000 rejected by the Tannadice outfit. However, the 24-year-old isn’t thought to be keen on the prospect of playing in League One and that could leave Celtic in pole position unless higher-placed English opposition emerges. Manager Ronny Deila is hoping that the Celtic board will pay to bring in the winger in January . Asked when he expected to speak with Mackay-Steven over the pre-contract, Deila added: ‘We will see, hopefully in a couple of days something will be arranged. ‘We have sent a letter to Dundee United saying we want to look at him. First of all we have to get him to sign and then we’ll take it from there.’ While Deila hopes to add Mackay-Steven, he remains adamant he doesn’t want to Kris Commons to depart. Neil Lennon has stated that Bolton Wanderers were likely to face competition from other clubs in any move to lure Commons away during the current window. Deila does not want veteran Kris Commons to leave, despite reported interest from clubs like Bolton . Deila, however, insisted he wasn’t aware of any approaches and stressed that he expected the 31-year-old to see out the campaign with Celtic – regardless of his contract impasse. ‘We’ve had nothing from no-one and our process with Kris is going on,’ said Deila. ‘But he is going to stay until the end of the season. ‘It’s longer-term we have to think about with Kris because we are going to have him until the summer. ‘His focus looked good last Monday [against Kilmarnock] and if he keeps on like that, things are going to be good for both of us.’ Asked about the possibility of a fee for Commons being dangled before the club, Deila replied: ‘If it makes the team worse, then we won’t do it. ‘Again everything has a price and you never know in football, but we have to have a better squad on February 1 than we have right now.’","Gary Mackay-Steven is expected to sign pre-season contract with Celtic .

"Richard Ramirez, the demonic serial killer who left satanic signs at murder scenes and mutilated victims' bodies during a reign of terror in the 1980s, died early Friday in a hospital, a prison official said. Ramirez, 53, had been taken from San Quentin's death row to a hospital where authorities said he died of liver failure. He had been housed on death row for decades and was awaiting execution, even though it has been years since anyone has been put to death in California. He was convicted in 1989 of 13 murders, five . attempted murders, 11 sexual assaults and 14 burglaries, which . terrorized Southern California in 1984 and 1985. His charges included . rape, sodomy and oral copulation. Richard Ramirez, center, with attorneys, Randall Martin, right and Daro Inouye, left in a San Francisco courtroom Oct. 5, 1990.

At his first court appearance, Ramirez raised a hand with a pentagram drawn on it and yelled, 'Hail, Satan.' His marathon trial, which ended in . 1989, was a horror show in which jurors heard about one victim's eyes . being gouged out and another's head being nearly severed. Courtroom . observers wept when survivors of some of the attacks testified. Satanic symbols were left at murder . scenes and some victims were forced to 'swear to Satan' by the killer, . who entered homes through unlocked windows and doors. Ramirez was finally run down and . beaten in 1985 by residents of an East Los Angeles neighborhood while . attempting a carjacking. They recognized him because his picture had . appeared that day in the news media.

The trial of Ramirez took a year, but . the entire case which was bogged down in pretrial motions and appeals . lasted four years, one of the longest criminal cases in U.S. history. Because of the notoriety of the case, more than 1600 prospective jurors were called. After his conviction, Ramirez flashed a two-fingered 'devil sign' to photographers and muttered a single word: 'Evil.' On his way to a jail bus, he sneered . in reaction to the verdict, muttering: 'Big deal. Death always went with . the territory. See you in Disneyland.'

"Derby president Sam Rush has condemned the actions of some Rams supporters following the defeat to rivals Nottingham Forest, saying the post-match events have 'brought shame on our club.' Saturday's game at the iPro Stadium, which ended in dramatic fashion with Derby-born midfielder Ben Osborne scoring in injury-time to snatch a 2-1 victory for Forest, was marred by an incident immediately after the final whistle when a fan got on to the pitch and tried to throw a punch at Reds defender Kelvin Wilson, before confronting a handful of other visiting players. The supporter, who ran on from a Derby section of the stadium and through a line of stewards, appeared to swing for Wilson and was then tackled to the ground by the defender's team-mates. A Derby fan swung a punch at Nottingham Forest defender Kelvin Wilson, who moved out out of the way . The fan was restrained after running onto the pitch at full-time to confront Forest's Kelvin Wilson . He was then surrounded by stewards and dragged away from the Forest players, who were celebrating their comeback victory at the home of their fiercest rivals. In another incident, Forest owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi claimed that a club car had been vandalised, with two tyres deflated, windscreen wipers broken and a personalised number plate wrenched off. The Kuwaiti businessman tweeted pictures of the Mercedes-Benz Viano with the words: 'Very professional! But in the end I don't mind at all! The three points are more important!' In a statement on Derby's official website Rush said: 'It is just over two years since I joined Derby County and I am proud of the progress that we have made during this time.

We are aiming to be successful but we will do it the right way and act with class at all times. 'Our success is very much influenced by our style.

"The Dutch amateur leagues look a frightening place to play if the Topklasse game between Barendrecht and Scheveningen is anything to go buy. During the latter stages of the clash, Barendrecht midfielder Mitchell van Gastel was stretchered off the pitch with a broken and bloody nose after suffering a nasty whack to the face. However, the injury didn't come from a flailing arm from an opposition player, instead it came from referee Wim Bronsvoort.

"A duo of bumbling hamburglars have been collared after a Burger King employee made off with their getaway car as they robbed the restaurant, police say - giving new meaning to the phrase 'home of the whopper.' The mishap began when two men allegedly stormed the Burger King in Stockton, California on Thursday with guns blazing and demanded cash. But while the suspects focused on emptying the register and a safe, a valiant employee was able to sneak out the fast food joint’s back door and found their car - and it was running. Have it your way: A duo of thieves tried to rob this Burger King in Stockton, California, but were thwarted when an employee turned the tables on them by stealing their getaway car, police say . The employee then got behind the wheel and drove off, hiding the vehicle around the block, CBS Sacramento reported. The worker's efforts successfully turned the tables on the slow-witted hooligans, who rushed out of the Burger King to find that someone had thrown a monkey wrench into their clean getaway plans. Choiceless, the alleged thieves decided to make a break for it - on foot. As they tried to make their escape through the high grass of a nearby field, police responded to the the scene and slapped cuffs on 23-year-old Jeremy Lovitt and 19-year-old Gabriel Gonzales.

All of the money that was taken in the heist was recovered and brought back to the Burger King. Fox40 reported that Lovitt and Gonzales were booked into the San Joaquin County Jail, where they rejected an interview request.

"Pope Francis (left) with Jorge Videla, head of the Argentine Junta, responsible for the death, disappearance and torture of tens of thousands of Argentines in its so-called Dirty War . The Pope has been accused of failing to stand up to the brutal military junta that slaughtered tens of thousands of Argentines in its so-called Dirty War. Critics say Jorge Mario Bergoglio did little to help those who disappeared when the country was under right-wing military rule – and too much to criticise the left-wing opponents of the generals. He has even been accused of turning a blind eye to the rounding up and torturing of his own Jesuit priests, something he strongly denies. The baggage of Argentine history also means potential diplomatic difficulties for Britain over the Falkland Islands. At a mass in Buenos Aires last year, on the 30th anniversary of the invasion of the Falklands, the Pope referred to the British as ‘usurpers’ and called for the Argentine dead to be thanked. He said: ‘We come to pray for all who have fallen, sons of the Homeland who went out to defend their mother, the Homeland, and to reclaim what is theirs, that is of the Homeland, and it was usurped.’ ‘The Homeland cannot exclude from its memory, anyone who was called; it has to take charge of so many hearts with scars, and say thank you to them, to those who stayed on the island or those submerged in the water, to all of them.’ At another anniversary service in 2008, he referred to those who sought to ‘de-Malvinise history and reality’. Bergoglio was the rector of an Argentine seminary at the time of the Falklands War in 1982. However the most damning criticism of the new Pope comes from the Argentine human rights lawyer Myriam Bregman, who has accused him of allowing his own Jesuit priests to be rounded up and tortured by the junta death squads, and of failing to intervene when families begged him to help find babies kidnapped by the regime. Bergoglio was head of the Jesuits in Argentina in the 1970s as the Dirty War began, first under the ageing Juan Peron and later under the military junta. Miss Bregman said that church leaders knew what was happening in the Dirty War, yet backed the regime. ‘The dictatorship could not have operated this way without this key support,’ she said. The Pope has been charged by critics with failure to confront a regime that killed its opponents, including not only left-wing guerillas but thousands of students and others considered ‘politically unacceptable’. Newly elected Pope Francis I appears on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica after being elected by the conclave of cardinals, at the Vatican . Argentine soldiers, still with their weapons, waiting to be moved from Port Stanley airport shortly after the surrender of the Falkland Islands to the British forces . The period became a by-word for brutality, with thousands of families suffering the disappearance of loved ones and the adoption by the armed forces of murder methods such as throwing detainees out of aeroplanes. One form of torture for families was the kidnapping of babies of mothers murdered as enemies of the regime and their adoption by families approved by the military dictatorship. The bishops of Argentina, led by Bergoglio, published an apology in October last year in which they acknowledged that the church had not protected its faithful. However the statement still blamed leftists as well as the junta for the killings. Pope Francis I, seen here conducting a mass in honour of Pope John Paul II in Buenos Aires cathedral in 2005, denies turning a blind eye to the torturing of Jesuit priests . The bishops appealed for information about where bodies had been buried or knew identities of stolen babies to come forward. However the apology came too late for liberal and left critics. They point to Bergoglio’s refusal to give evidence in open court on the events of the 1970s until 2010, when his answers were considered evasive by some. He is also accused of failing to prevent the torture of two of his own Jesuit priests, Orlando Yorio and Francisco Jalics, both supporters of left-wing liberations theology who were seized by the regime in 1976. However supporters of Bergoglio say he took risks behind the scenes, including visiting the home of dictator Jorge Videla to say mass and appeal for mercy. The two men were released and Bergoglio did not discuss the incident until 2010. The new Pope is said by supporters to have worked regularly and at some danger to himself to curb the excesses of the military. Bergoglio is also accused of failing to help a family whose baby was stolen despite appeals to do so from Rome. The family have called his attitude ‘cowardly’. Estela de la Cuadra, whose family helped launch the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo in the final years of the junta, said: ‘He doesn’t face this reality and it doesn’t bother him. The question is how to save his name, save himself. But he can’t keep these allegations from reaching the public. The people know how he is.’ Bergoglio has stood out strongly against the current government of Cristina Fernandez, saying last year that Argentina was suffering from demagoguery, corruption and efforts to re-establish authoritarianism.

"Ten months after clinching his third PGA Tour title and declaring he was among the game's top five players, Patrick Reed enhanced his golfing status by winning the Hyundai Tournament of Champions. Never short of confidence - notably shown when he shushed the home crowd at the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles - the 24-year-old American produced a stellar display of shot-making over the closing holes at the Kapalua Resort before beating compatriot Jimmy Walker in a playoff to earn the winner's cheque for £755,000. A birdie at the 15th was followed by a stunning eagle at the par-four 16th, where he holed out from the fairway. Though Reed lipped out from four feet to bogey the 17th, he birdied the par-five last, and again in the playoff, to seal victory.

'Early on I seemed to leave a lot of putts short, just didn't get them to the hole. It all kind of just turned around when I hit a really good three-wood on the fifth hole, the par-five.' Reed's eagle at the 16th, where his ball landed to the right of the hole before spinning sharply sideways and disappearing into the cup, lifted him into a tie for the lead. 'I heard the applause,' he smiled. 'I didn't really see it but I was able to see the highlights. I think it spiked pretty hard ... luckily I made that there.'

Reed had booked his place in the elite winners-only field at Kapalua with victory at the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral last March, where he brashly claimed he was 'one of the top five players in the world', though his form since has been erratic. 'My game was still there,' he explained. 'I just never put anything together. There was always one piece that would be missing. But I felt like I was improving, my stats were improving. Things in my swing were improving. 'Later on in the year it started to show again ... hopefully it will continue the good play that we have now.' Reed was specific with his goals for 2015. 'One of them is a multi-win year,' he said.

"Viktor Troicki ruthlessly dismantled ailing Kazakh qualifier Mikhail Kukushkin 6-2 6-3 to win the Sydney International for his second career ATP title on Saturday. The 28-year-old Serb won the last four games of the first set and was 4-1 up in the second when Kukushkin took a medical timeout to have treatment on his left thigh. The Kazakh rallied to win the next two games for his first break of serve in the match but Troicki was just too strong and broke back before serving out the match and claiming the title with his 13th ace. Viktor Troicki dismantled ailing Kazakh qualifier Mikhail Kukushkin 6-2 6-3 to win the Sydney International . The 28-year-old Serb won in straight sets to pick up his second career ATP title victory . Once ranked 12th in the world, Troicki is working his way back up the rankings after a doping ban that took a year out of his career. His first-round opponent at the Australian Open will be Jiri Vesely, who won his first ATP open title after a 6-3 6-2 victory over Frenchman Adrian Mannarino at the Auckland Open. A day after stunning world number 16 Kevin Anderson in the semi-finals, the big-serving 21-year-old sent down 11 aces in the 67 minute contest to become the first qualifier in more than three decades to win New Zealand's most prestigious title. Mannarino had started the match in fine fashion by breaking his opponent's serve in the first game but the powerful Vesely broke back and grabbed a second when the Frenchman double faulted before serving out the set with a searing ace. The second set started with a Mannarino double fault and things rarely looked up for the world number 44 afterwards with only the rain clouds gathering over Auckland looking likely to stop Vesely. A downpour came with the Czech 5-1 up but the players were able to resume without too much delay and the world number 63 wrapped up victory with another huge ace.

"Shashi Obhrai threatened to kill the woman and bury her in the garden after she contacted police and was taken to hospital . An Indian woman who was kept as a slave and passed between three middle class families has spoken of her traumatic ordeal where she was beaten, burned and raped. The 40-year-old Indian woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was kept prisoner for six months by the Obhrai family on their £2million estate in Middlesex. She was passed between two other . families - who cannot be named for legal reasons - where she was forced . to work for £2 an hour and raped several times by butcher Enkarta . Balapovi. Her passport was taken away and she was forced to work 17-hour shifts seven days a week, fed only on out-of-date food and the chewed leftovers of their three children. When the woman, who could only speak Hindi, tried to contact police on multiple occasions but she was returned to her abusers and they were used as interpreters. The woman, who is illiterate, came to Britain in 2005 in search of a better life, but was left wheelchair-bound after being injured so badly by her 'employers' over a three-year period. Shashi Obhrai acted as the woman's . master and on one occasion beat her with a rolling pin because she did . not like the way she made chapattis. The victim was left with scars on her body from the fingernails of Obhrai, who also dragged her down stairs, burned her with an iron and threatened to stab her with insulin needles. On another occasion the victim was too dizzy to cook because she was so underfed, so her masters beat her until she was sick and made her clear up the vomit with her own clothes. 'They have made my life hell. I have suffered with depression and sleepless nights for a very long time. I have to take medication so that I can sleep. 'They have treated me so badly that I . worry at night that they will come for me. Shashi Obhrai put a hot iron . on my arm when I asked her for my earnings to be paid,' The Independent . reported. Over the three years she was kept as a slave, she was paid just £2,000, which she sent back to her family in Hyderabad. Authorities estimate that she should have earned £170,000 during that time, considering the long hours she was forced to work. She . was first taken to hospital in 2006 when her then 'employer' Shamina . Yousuf, 33, hurled a cup at her and slashed open her foot. The woman did not know how to call 999 until 2007, but faced language barriers when she did. She made repeated calls on one day, but by the time Hertfordshire . Police arrived the Obhrais were home and she could not speak to them. Another time she showed police a jar of unrecognisable slop she had been given to eat, and she was taken to hospital. Enkarta Balapove (left) was convicted of rape and Shamina Yousef was convcited of assaulting the woman . But after being discharged from hospital she was returend to Obhrai, who acted as her interpreter, took her home in tears, and then threatened to kill her. Obhrai held a knife to her neck and told her she had spolied the family name and would be buried in the garden and no one would ever know. She attempted to contact police and other organisations at least a dozen times but her pleas were ignored, Croydon Crown Court heard. On one occasion a professional interpreter . told police she was telling lies, and that this was common in India. Prosecuting, Caroline Haughley said: 'Various state agencies failed her… . ignoring her repeated pleas for help, not adhering to their own . investigative practice and it could be said ignoring the obvious.' Obhrai, 54, of Moor Park, Middlesex and Yousuf, 33, of Edgware, north London, were both convicted yesterday of assault. Obhrai, an optician, was additionally convicted of threats to kill. Balapovi, 54, of St John's Wood, northwest London, was convicted of rape by a jury at Croydon Crown Court. They will be sentenced next month. Two other defendants were acquitted. The victim is suing the Hertfordshire force which initially investigated the case. Corinna Ferguson, legal Officer for Liberty, told The Independent: 'This trial may not have taken place at all had Liberty not reminded the police of their obligations towards victims under the Human Rights Act.' Hertfordshire police said it would be 'inappropriate to comment' while aspects of the case were still subject to criminal and civil process.","Indian woman was raped several times by one of her abusers .

"Andy Murray was delighted to welcome a third British male entrant into the Australian Open singles when Kyle Edmund came through the qualifying event to make the main draw. Murray, 27, is increasingly taking on a mentoring role when it comes to his younger compatriots but when the main action begins he will need to focus exclusively on himself. And according to former British No 1 Greg Rusedski, who had a spell coaching Yorkshire’s Edmund last year, the stakes could hardly be higher this season for the Scot. Greg Rusedski believes Andy Murray will need to display attacking intent in order to win a major in 2015 . Kyle Edmund qualified for the main draw and become the third British male entrant into the Australian Open . Murray (left) pictured in training ahead of the Australian Open as coach Amelie Mauresmo (right) watches on . ‘This year will be the defining year for Andy. I think 2015 will tell us if he will ever win a major again,’ said Rusedski, who described the scheduled run here of Murray facing Grigor Dimitrov in the fourth round and Roger Federer in the quarter-finals as a ‘brutal draw’. While believing he can negotiate it, Rusedski — commentating for Eurosport on the event — believes he will need to display attacking intent all the way. ‘If he’s going to come out and win this tournament, he needs to be aggressive on the second serve, take on the forehand when it’s there to be hit and use the backhand up the line. ‘If he does those things he has a real shot. Andy has an incredible sense of what he needs to do at the big moments in the big matches, which is so important. Amelie Mauresmo [his coach] would have had all of the off-season to work on the areas of Murray’s game that needed working on and physically he looks very, very well. Last year was a season of change for Andy Murray (left), who parted ways with trainer Jez Green (right) Murray also split with another of his coaching staff in Dani Vallverdu (right) last November . The Scot has taken to mentoring young British talent but Greg Rusedski says he must focus on himself . ‘His performance in Abu Dhabi [earlier this month], where he absolutely destroyed Rafael Nadal in two sets, was the best I’ve seen him play in a long time and he played well in the Hopman Cup, too. It’s a good opportunity to see where Andy really is at the moment.’ Murray certainly looks primed for a decent run at a tournament where his record is admirably consistent. Prior to his quarter-final loss 12 months ago to Roger Federer, not long after returning from back surgery, he had reached three finals and a semi-final in four years. He will kick off his campaign on the opening day of the tournament — the early hours of Monday morning UK time — with a match on the newly enhanced Margaret Court Arena, which now has a sliding roof and can house 7,500 spectators. His opponent will be Indian qualifier Yuki Bhambri, 22, the world No 314, who has a nice feel for the ball and won the junior Australian Open six years ago. He will have nothing to lose after coming through three preliminary rounds and the same can be said of Edmund, who won his final eliminator on Saturday with a gutsy 6-7, 6-4, 9-7 win over Dane Propoggia in two hours and 23 minutes. Him making the main draw by right just a week after his 20th birthday gave something of a feelgood factor to the British game, with Heather Watson winning the women’s title in Hobart. The only disappointment was that Liam Broady could not join them in the main draw, falling 7-5, 6-3 to the 36-year-old Michael Russell. Like James Ward, who will face Fernando Verdasco on Tuesday, Edmund was a visitor to Murray’s December training camp in Miami and managed to impress his host. The 27-year-old is tipped for a decent run in Melbourne where his record is admirably consistent . ‘Kyle has a good attitude, very calm with his feet on the ground,’ said Murray. ‘Liam got to the last round, Heather has won and my brother and Jonny Marray both won doubles events last week. It would be nice to have a good year for all the British players. I’m pleased for Kyle and it’s good to see Liam doing well. They both work very hard and, when you see someone putting in the effort, it’s nice to see them get the rewards.’ Edmund has long been identified as the leading British prospect of his generation but, as with most players trying to make the transition to the top level, progress has not been entirely smooth. Last year he finished with his long-time coach Colin Beecher and then had two mentors in Rusedski and James Trotman before opting to go with the latter full-time. He won a Challenger level event in Japan late last season and now his renewed progression will get a good test from world No 39 Steve Johnson, the Californian who enjoyed a breakthrough season in 2014. Against local hope Propoggia, the fair-skinned Edmund’s phlegmatic temperament was stretched by the home crowd, who repeatedly suggested that he needed to get the sunscreen out in the heat. Edmund said: ‘I wasn’t playing 10 out of 10 tennis but I needed to be a 10 out of 10 competitor.’","Greg Rusedski believes this will be a defining season for Andy Murray .

"Stuart Lancaster will make 'no guarantees' in his bid to dissuade Danny Cipriani from moving to France, according to former England fly-half Toby Flood. England head coach Lancaster met Cipriani earlier this week and will on Wednesday announce his senior and Saxons squads ahead of the RBS Six Nations. Cipriani is expected to be named in the Saxons group in a move that could lead the Sale fly-half to join French Top 14 champions Toulon in the summer. Former England fly-half, now with Tolouse, says that Danny Cipriani is the master of his own England future . Cipriani has been capped for the national side nine times since 2008, scoring 52 points . England refuse to select overseas-based players, save for 'exceptional circumstances' - a policy that ended Flood's Test career when he left Leicester last year. Flood revealed sympathy for Cipriani's position, should he be deemed England's fourth-choice fly-half in Lancaster's updated squads. 'Stuart can't guarantee someone a position - he can't guarantee anything,' Flood told Press Association Sport. 'He's a bright guy, he won't sit there and say either 'actually you know what, you're fourth choice', or 'you're going to play'. Cipriani has played himself back into contention for an England recall with outstanding displays for Sale . 'He's smart enough to realise he will say 'you're in the mix, and you're in a position where we do believe you can add to the side'. And that decision then falls on that player to make the call. 'And that is true from Stuart - I think he's going to say 'you've got an opportunity to fight it out, but at the same time it's your decision'. And that's all Stuart can do - he will make no guarantees, because he can't. You can't hedge on England. You either get in or you don't. 'And the difference in that only comes down to form and timing, and Stuart can't control either of those for someone. He will always be honest and say 'you're in the mix' and that's probably as far as he can go.' Cipriani is considering a move to French club Toulon ahead of the announcement of the Six Nations squad . He continued: 'The hard thing is, if you keep hearing 'you're in the top three' or 'you're in the top four', it doesn't really sell it to you. 'It's fantastic to be in the top four in England, of course - that's a huge honour. But at the same time maybe you can go somewhere else and be number one and do something completely different. 'Third or fourth choice means if everyone's fit and well you don't play for your country. You come in for two or three days a week every so often, but then you go back to your club to play. 'That's a tough position to be in: you can feel as though you're always dipping your toe in the water but it's never quite yours.' At 27, the Sale star will be hoping that his England career is not over yet . Former Newcastle playmaker Flood is now settled and thriving at Toulouse after his summer switch from Leicester. The 29-year-old will face his ex-Tigers team-mate and England incumbent George Ford when Bath pitch camp at the Stade Ernest Wallon on Sunday. Flood believes Ford can 'nail down' England's fly-half berth with 'another big performance' when the Six Nations opens next month with an intimidating trip to Wales. Toulouse's 60-cap pivot also expects a stern challenge from Bath's increasingly potent midfield. 'I think George will be number one in the Six Nations - certainly for the first couple of games,' said Flood, speaking on behalf of Land Rover, official vehicle of Premiership Rugby and a Rugby World Cup 2015 partner. The fly-half breaks past Shane Horgan of Ireland during the RBS Six Nations match back in 2008 . 'But he needs another big performance in there, really, to nail that down. 'England have five guys chomping at the bit, with Owen Farrell, Stephen Myler, Cipriani and Freddie Burns too. 'That's the Jonny Wilkinson effect: every young kid wanted to emulate Jonny and drop that goal, so now you've got five guys of a similar age here who are desperate to get involved. 'There's a lot of layers to Bath's attack, with George, Sam Burgess, Kyle Eastmond and Jonathan Joseph all options in midfield. 'George comes to the line really well, waits for a defence to make a decision and then usually chooses the right option. Kyle is another pair of hands and Burgess can cause absolute mayhem. They are willing to take risks, play with flair and take things on. 'It's nice to see an English team with almost carte blanche.' Cipriani had a meeting with Stuart Lancaster earlier this week and is set for further talks on Wednesday .","Danny Cipriani could play for England in the RBS Six Nations .

"It should come as no surprise that Joe Simpson appears wise beyond his years. The 26-year-old Wasps scrum-half speaks with the air of a man twice his age after a year of ‘emotional turmoil’ following the tragically premature death of his 58-year-old mother Brigid, who passed away last January after a six-month battle with skin cancer. That Simpson has come through as a calm and reflective man, and happens to be playing the best rugby of his life,  is testament to him and the club. ‘Last season was tough,’ Simpson said. ‘It was an emotionally draining year. She sacrificed so much for me, driving me all over the country from the age of 10, to club games and to England camps. Some of the locations were far from glamorous and I remember her standing watching in the pouring rain, all wrapped up. My family have always been incredibly supportive.’ Wasps scrum half Joe Simpson (left) tries to evade the tackle of Bath fly half George Ford at The Rec . Simpson (left) puts his body on the line to halt Matt Banahan as the Bath winger powers over for a try . Simpson has been in superb form for a rejuvenated Wasps outfit this season . After his mum died, Simpson was grateful for the presence of rugby in his life. ‘Rugby was a brilliant distraction for me,’ he said. ‘The coaches, the owner and every single member of staff were magnificent. They let me take as much time off as I wanted after Mum died but I didn’t want to take time off. I’m a rugby player. It’s what I do. ‘Being around the guys, I could temporarily forget things out on the training pitch. The support I received will stay with me. It meant a lot to me at a time when I was feeling pretty low. ‘I’ve come back feeling fresh and I’m loving my rugby and being part of the rejuvenation of this club on and off the pitch. I’m over the moon with how things are going for me.’ Danny Care (Harlequins) Age: 28 . Height: 5ft 7in . Weight:13st 4lb . 2014-15 games: 15; Points: 21 . Ben Youngs (Leicester) Age: 25 . Height: 5ft 10in . Weight: 13st 9lb . 2014-15 games: 14; Points: 5 . Richard Wigglesworth (Saracens) Age: 31 . Height:5ft 9in . Weight:13st 6lb . 2014-15 games: 14; Points: 22 . Simpson, one of a core group of Wasps players who refused to jump ship when the club went through financial instability two seasons ago, was owed some loyalty from the side he supported as a lad growing up near their Acton training ground in West London. With huge investment, a move to Coventry’s Ricoh Arena and an ambitious recruitment drive under way, Simpson’s outstanding form at No 9 is a reflection of the club’s health. ‘The players that (director of rugby) Dai Young has brought in have gelled with the existing players and you’re able to see that in the results,’ Simpson added. ‘We’re not the finished product, we still have a way to go, but it’s a very healthy place to play, train and be part of. I’m playing the best rugby of my career. ‘I’m bossing the matches more effectively without losing that dangerous edge with the ability to snap up tries here and there and utilise my finishing and my pace. That’s something I love to bring to the game because it sets me apart from other No 9s.’ On Saturday night at The Stoop, Simpson goes head to head with England scrum-half Danny Care, the man he replaced in the 2011 World Cup squad after Care suffered a foot injury in the warm-up game against Wales. Simpson’s solitary cap in the pool win over Georgia seems a long time ago. Wasps coach Dai Young has overseen a difficult period for the club following their move to Coventry . It is not inconceivable that his club form could see a return in time for this year’s World Cup. A strong show against Care in a must-win European game for both clubs would do his chances no harm, four days before Stuart Lancaster names his Six Nations squad. ‘Playing for England is why you play rugby,’ said Simpson, who racked up his 150th game for Wasps against Bath last Saturday. ‘I’ve already had the experience of being around the squad for a few years and being in autumn and Six Nations squads. I’ve been capped and been to a World Cup and that’s where I want to be. There’s no bigger stage. ‘I haven’t spoken to the England coaches. I’m just trying to keep my head down here and carry on doing what I’m doing. Simpson (left) replaced Danny Care in the 2011 World Cup squad following the Harlequins scrum half's injury . ‘My all-round game is at a peak and I want to keep improving until my mid-30s. I feel like I can offer something to England and I’d love to be given the opportunity. It’s about me maintaining my form and the club maintaining its form. ‘I always set my targets as high as possible while trying to stay realistic. But my ambition has to be to break into that England squad. I would love to be capped in the World Cup. First and foremost, I’d love to be part of the World Cup squad in the summer. That would give me a shot and then it would be down to me to take my opportunity.’ Following the personal tragedy of last season, few would begrudge Simpson a break.","Joe Simpson has been outstanding for Wasps this season .

"The Youngs brothers did enough to fill another family album at Welford Road on Friday night as the Tigers stormed to a bonus-point victory which just about keeps their European campaign alive. Leicester had taken care of business by the 53rd minute of this Pool 3 encounter. That was when they claimed the crucial fourth try which put them temporarily level on points with pool leaders Toulon. Richard Cockerill’s side must somehow exorcise their ghosts at Ravenhill next weekend by beating Ulster with another four-try haul if they are to give themselves even a faint chance of reaching the quarter-finals, but they are still in the mix. Leicester Tigers fly half Freddie Burns fires over a conversion during his side's victory at Welford Road . Leicester centre Seremaia Bai has his progress halted by Scarlets winger Hadleigh Parkes . Jordan Crane (far left) emerges from a powerful Tigers rolling maul to score his side's second try . Leicester hooker Tom Youngs scores the first of his two tries after coming on as a replacement . For that, they owe a lot to their super siblings. Ben Youngs inspired the Tigers with a vintage, vibrant performance which enhances his prospects of retaining his England scrum-half place next month, and brother Tom came off the bench to score two second-half tries. The Scarlets arrived at Welford Road without Wales trio Ken Owens, Samson Lee and Liam Williams, and the absence of these key men left the visitors vulnerable, especially up front. Bath-bound No 10 Rhys Priestland put them ahead with a sixth-minute penalty, only for Leicester to seize the initiative with two tries in five minutes. Leicester and England lock Geoff Parling rises high to claim a lineout as his pack get ready for another drive . From an attacking lineout, Samoan prop Lugovi’i Mulipola marked his comeback from injury with an explosive burst over the gainline. The ball was deftly transferred via Adam Thompstone and Mathew Tait to Miles Benjamin, and the wing touched down on the left. Freddie Burns added the wide conversion and was on target again shortly afterwards, following a staple try from the Tigers repertoire. Again, Tom Croft caught the ball at a lineout in the Scarlets’ 22 and the pack drove over for Jordan Crane to score. It appeared the writing was on the wall for the visitors, but whenever they had possession they looked threatening. Harry Robinson crosses for a well-executed Scarlets try but Leicester were far too good for the Welsh side . Priestland narrowed the gap with a penalty and after Leicester lock Graham Kitchener was sin-binned for a ruck offence, the Scarlets hit back, as the forwards rumbled through the 22 from a lineout drive and prop Rob Evans peeled off the maul to force his way over. Yet the contest became a procession after the break. Ben Youngs and Tait cleared the way for Thompstone to score in the 47th minute and Tom Youngs’ try from a lineout drive brought the bonus, before the England hooker struck after his brother carved into the 22. Harry Robinson went over twice at the other end but Leicester kept swarming forward and Sam Harrison scored their sixth try from Robert Barbieri’s superb drive and off-load.","Leicester score tries through Miles Benjamin, Jordan Crane, Adam Thompstone, Tom Youngs (two) and Sam Harrison .

"Andrew Flintoff was once the king of cricket - now it appears he may fancy himself as 'The King'. The former England all-rounder was in fine voice as he treated TV viewers around the world to an impressive Elvis Presley impersonation during his latest appearance in Australia's Big Bash League. The 37-year-old's live on-mic observations during his high-profile stint Down Under have been a huge hit and he again did not let fans down, after some mild encouragement from former England coach David Lloyd.

The Brisbane Heat star belted out a near-perfect rendition of The King's smash hit 'In the Ghetto' Flintoff was interrupted when he was beaten for six at long on by Hobart Hurricane's Ben Hilfenhaus . As Flintoff fielded during Brisbane Heat's victory over Hobart Hurricanes at The Gabba, Lloyd tweeted to TV commentators urging them to ask the Ashes hero to get 'singing ELVIS!!!!!!'. When the message was relayed, Flintoff duly obliged, bursting into a rendition of 'In the Ghetto' for more than a minute in a plausible imitation of the American rocker. He was interrupted when tail-end batsman Ben Hilfenhaus launched a six over his head at long on. Heat won the match by 18 runs after a highly-entertaining 81 from 35 balls by Chris Lynn, but afterwards it was Flintoff's star turn that commanded the social media attention. 'Hope my Elvis impersonation didn't offend any viewers @tensporttv !! £myherotheking,' Flintoff later tweeted.

"It was always a case of tough love when it came to Alan Pardew and Sammy Ameobi. The former Newcastle manager would openly air his reluctance to sanction a new deal for the Geordie winger, preferring instead to keep him hungry with the threat of being released by his hometown club. It was a bait Ameobi took, winning a regular starting place having been on the periphery for the best part of three seasons. Sammy Ameobi admits he is fighting for his Newcastle future following the departure of Alan Pardew . Pardew handed Ameobi his first-team debut at Newcastle but left St James Park for Crystal Palace this month . But with Pardew now gone, it’s more a case of tough luck for the 22-year-old, whose contract expires in the summer. Ameobi's Newcastle deal runs out in the summer . ‘When the next manager comes in, if there is one, I need to prove myself all over again,’ Ameobi told Sportsmail. ‘I’m obviously playing for my career, essentially, but it is something I’m looking forward to. I’m very confident in my own ability. I have every opportunity to start for Newcastle every week. Hopefully I can do that, whoever comes in.’ Ameobi - who was loaned out to Middlesbrough in 2013 - believes he had won Pardew over with his performances this season. ‘I think I did prove I was worth my place, yes,’ he added, ahead of his anticipated return from a knee injury against Southampton this evening. ‘That’s what I always wanted to do really. It’s my last season here so I need to prove myself if I want to stay and get a new contract. ‘That’s what I did but there is still a long way to go. There is a lot of hard work ahead and I am just looking forward to each game and to try and prove myself to whoever comes in. ‘Of course, the ultimate aim is to get a new deal and stay here. I really want to stay. It’s my hometown, I’m happy and I love it here. ‘It is just a privilege to play for Newcastle United. It is my dream club. I have supported them since I was a kid. Every week, I don’t take anything for granted and it’s a real blessing to be playing here.’ John Carver remains in caretaker charge of the Magpies. He brought Ameobi’s older brother, Shola, through the academy at the club and knows the family well. And Ameobi Jnr added: ‘Obviously he has been here a long time and I know him well. He’s always looked after me, so hopefully he can get me a new contract!’ Sammy's brother Shola, pictured celebrating against Sunderland in 2012, also came through the  academy . Ameobi, meanwhile, was part of the Newcastle squad humiliated during the 4-0 defeat at Southampton in September, a result which left them bottom of the Premier League. ‘We want to put that right,’ he said. ‘We can’t let them walk all over us like they did at their place. ‘The defeat there was one of those days. It happens to every team. Everyone has had it at some point in their career. Everything went against us, they played really good football and they took us to the cleaners really. ‘We’ve got to make up for that now.’","Sammy Ameobi's contract at Newcastle expires in the summer .

"John Carver admits he feared for his own future and Newcastle’s season after he rowed with supporters ahead of their 4-0 humiliation at Southampton, labelling the day ‘one of the darkest of my life’. This evening, caretaker boss Carver and his players will be bidding for revenge against a Saints side who played their part in one of the worst days in United’ s recent history. Carver, then assistant to Alan Pardew, got involved in an expletive-laden altercation with fans before the game when he objected to a ‘Pardew Out’ banner in the away end. Newcastle caretaker manager John Carver regrets his involvement in a row with supporters in September . Carver (second left) argued with fans before Newcastle were beaten 4-0 by Southampton . Newcastle fans hold a banner revealing their frustration at former manager Alan Pardew during that game . What followed on the pitch was a comprehensive drubbing to leave the Magpies bottom of the Premier League as the Toon Army turned on the team and their manager. And Carver – who was a teenage player at St James’ Park before returning as a coach in 1992 - says that September afternoon ranks as the lowest of his time at the club. ‘It was absolutely the worst day of my time here – it was one of the darkest days of my life to be honest,’ he said. ‘I was embarrassed to be part of Newcastle United coaching staff. I feared the worst for the season that night. It stayed with me for a long time. ‘Yes, we played against a good team but we created nothing on the day and they could have won it by six or seven, and that's not right. I'll be telling the guys at the team meeting that we've got a point to prove.’ Carver later issued an apology for the clash with fans, as did goalkeeping coach Andy Woodman, who got involved in a Twitter row with another supporter. And Carver reflected: ‘It started badly even before kick-off. I have to go on record to say I didn't have a problem with the fans protesting, but when Tim Krul said to me he was a bit disappointed with the banners being raised before kick-off, that was the only thing that upset me. Graziano Pelle (centre) scored twice for Southampton against Newcastle and Carver will need to stop him . Former Lyon manager Remi Garde has been linked with the permanent manager's vacancy at Newcastle . ‘People who know me know that I'm never going to walk away from a situation like that. I was trying to do the best for the team and all I was saying was telling them not to put the banners up there and then. Then he came back at me a couple of times and unfortunately I reacted the wrong way. ‘You know what I'm like, I'm not a shrinking violet, am I? I apologised afterwards, absolutely, and rightly so, but there wasn't one that came the other way.’ Carver, though, says he was concerned about the reaction towards him in the following game at home to Hull. ‘I do care and I'd realised I made a mistake,’ said Carver, who celebrated his 50th birthday yesterday. ‘I realised how bad we'd been during the game. The fans were right to be unhappy with the way we'd played. I made that situation even worse and going into the Hull game straight after, I did feel uncomfortable for the first time ever when we were doing the warm-up. ‘I wasn't quite sure of the reaction I'd get from people but I have to say it was very good. That surprised me a bit to be honest. ‘Then we went on a winning run and the reaction from the fans was brilliant, that helped and made us stronger.’ Carver could remain at the helm at Newcastle until the summer, when Garde could take the job . Carver, meanwhile, will sit down with managing director Lee Charnley after today's game to discuss the club's search for a new head coach. The squad fly to Dubai tomorrow for a four-day break and do not play again until the trip to Hull on January 31. It is expected that an announcement will be made before the end of the month, with former Lyon boss Remi Garde the favourite to be installed. He, though, would prefer to wait until the summer and there is a strong possibility that Carver will be put in charge until May.","John Carver argued with Newcastle supporters before emphatic defeat .

"Gus Poyet says there can be no more excuses for the shortcomings of his Sunderland side after signing Jermain Defoe from Toronto FC. The Black Cats head coach has repeatedly bemoaned the attacking personnel available to him at the Stadium of Light. Indeed, Sunderland are the Premier League’s second-lowest scorers with just 18, but Poyet said: ‘There is no doubt we all needed a lift, and the club is a different club today. I’ve got no doubts about that. Sunderland boss Gus Poyet has told his players 'there are no excuses' after the signing of Jermain Defoe . Defoe is in contention to face former side Tottenham at White Hart Lane on the weekend . Black Cats manager Poyet said he was thrilled to have signed the former Tottenham striker . 11 - Aston Villa . 18 - Sunderland . 19 - Burnley . 20 - West Brom, Hull, Leicester . 22 - Crystal Palace, Stoke . ‘It doesn’t happen that way very often, and it’s not very often we’re in a position where we can bring in a player of the quality of Jermain Defoe. ‘But we’ve got him here, and we have to use him in the right way now. There are no excuses now. I am responsible, and I’m telling you there are no excuses now, so whatever happens from this point onwards is down to me. ‘I cannot say one thing one day and then change when it suits me. We were missing something in front of goal, but now we’ve got Jermain. Now I need to keep him fit and playing, and find a way with Jermain on the pitch to make him score goals. That’s my challenge now.’ Poyet has revealed that he used his friendship with Defoe – who he worked with at Spurs - to get the deal started, before handing over to sporting director Lee Congerton to thrash out the terms of his £80,000-per-week contract. Poyet was pleased with how quickly Sunderland moved to sign Defoe ahead of their league rivals . The Uruguayan – who could now start Defoe at White Hart Lane – explained: ‘When the club was happy to start finding out about the possibility, I talked to Jermain. Simple. ‘I knew that Jermain would tell me the truth. He wouldn’t say, “Let me wait and see, and maybe I’ll give you an answer next week or in another week’s time”. It was straightforward. ‘When I knew what Jermain told me, I went back to Lee and said, “Now the ball is on your side of the court”. As soon as I spoke to Jermain, I knew we had a chance, and that was the main thing. We had a proper chance, and it proved right, so credit to Jermain. ‘Then all the rest of the deal was tough, there were so many things involved, but that is credit to the club.’","Gus Poyet has stated his delight at being able to sign Jermain Defoe .

"The Rangers Supporters Trust have issued a rallying call to fans ahead of the club's forthcoming extraordinary general meeting called to implement boardroom change. However, the supporters' body was dealt a blow when they were informed they could not take any legal proceedings against shareholder Mike Ashley following his reported bid to get security over Ibrox and Murray Park. The Newcastle United owner filed documents notifying land registry he plans to add his company, Sports Direct, to the title deeds of the club's stadium and training ground, with the thought that he is about to offer the cash-strapped Govan club a loan. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Rangers fans break into Ibrox in protest against the board . Mike Ashley reportedly attempted to get security over Rangers' stadium and training ground . Rangers fans stormed an entrance at Ibrox to  voice their feelings against the board on Friday night . The Ibrox soap opera took another twist on Friday when Rangers' largest shareholder Dave King called for an EGM. Later in the evening Gers fans demonstrated outside the ground against Ashley and the board before the game against Hearts, which was abandoned due to freezing conditions. South African-based businessman King wants Ashley's allies Derek Llambias and Barry Leach, as well as chairman David Somers and non-executive director James Easdale, removed from the board with immediate effect. While the future of the Scottish Championship club remains up in the air, the RST issued a statement outlining their position. The statement read: 'The Rangers Supporters Trust has, at considerable time and expense over the past two days, taken detailed legal advice over the recent move by the Rangers board to give notice of intention to grant security over Ibrox to Sports Direct. Supporters swarmed the entrance after the clash with Hearts was called off due to the weather . Mounted police stood guard in front of the entrance to the stadium before the match against Hearts . One of the supporter's flags read: 'Rangers F.C. supported by fans, directed by parasites' 'It is the opinion of both our senior counsel, junior counsel and solicitors that we can take no further action at this time. 'It is quite clear from their detailed examination of statements made by the board regarding Ibrox that, whilst giving the impression to fans and shareholders that they were making a commitment not to grant security over Ibrox, the board was in fact meticulously careful not to stray into language which would actually give such a legal commitment. 'We believe the effect of those statements was to be deliberately misleading. 'We have however been advised of various possible remedies, including those against individual directors, which may be available to us should the board actually go ahead and grant the security. We will continue to monitor this very, very closely. 'We are extremely angry that we are in a position where we are having to explore legal remedies in order to try to stop Rangers directors from acting in their own interests and those of Mr Ashley, rather than the shareholders and fans of Rangers.

'We hope the vast majority of shareholders and fans will back us in this endeavour and we have to ask for their help. 'An EGM has now been called by Dave King.

"Tillakaratne Dilshan eased to his 19th one-day international century to anchor his side to a six-wicket victory over New Zealand in the second game of their seven-match series at Seddon Park in Hamilton on Thursday. Dilshan scored 116 from 127 balls in Sri Lanka's 252-4 as the visitors levelled the series at 1-1 after New Zealand won the first game at Hagley Oval in Christchurch on Sunday. Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews was 39 not out with Lahiru Thirimanne on two as the visitors chased down New Zealand's 248 all out in 47.4 overs. Tillakaratne Dilshan blasted 116 from 127 deliveries in Sri Lanka's victory against New Zealand . Dilshan's century helped him to level the series 1-1 against New Zealand with five games remaining . Dilshan's century was his 19th for Sri Lanka in the one-day format of the game . Dilshan was the key for the visitors, combining with fellow opener Dimuth Karunaratne (21) in a 64-run opening stand before he scored 52 runs with Kumar Sangakkara (38), 47 with Mahela Jayawardene (27) and 74 with Mathews to keep the scoreboard ticking over at almost a run a ball. The right hander brought up his century with a wonderful cover drive for his 13th boundary and let out an almighty bellow and then set about finishing the game in a hurry, belting Adam Milne for three boundaries in the 45th over. He was dismissed in the next over when pace bowler Matt Henry, who is not in the World Cup squad, had him caught by wicketkeeper Luke Ronchi from a short ball. Henry finished with 2-34 from 9.4 overs. New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum had earlier blasted 12 boundaries and five sixes to score 117, his fifth one-day international century, the only other bright spot in a otherwise poor performance from the hosts.

"Jermain Defoe has touched down in Sunderland head of his move to the Black Cats, and says he can't wait to start scoring goals. Defoe has been in the North East tying up a deal, and underwent a medical at the Academy of Light on Thursday. The former England striker only joined MLS side Toronto during the summer, but, despite having scored 11 goals in 16 league appearances after signing a four-year deal, he has not settled and has been courted by a series of Premier League clubs. Jermain Defoe smiles for photographers as he leaves the Academy of Light in Sunderland on Thursday . Defoe (right) is poised to sign for Sunderland from Major League Soccer side Toronto . Sunderland boss Gus Poyet won the race to sign the 32-year old striker who he hopes will fire the Black Cats clear of relegation. Defoe told The Mirror: ‘I felt so sharp. All that hard work has paid off. I can’t wait to start scoring goals for Sunderland. ‘Everybody knows how much I love English football and I still feel that I have a lot to offer. ‘People might look at my age, but I have always looked after myself and I hope I can show that with my performances.’ Defoe was holding a pair of trainers as he headed from the Academy of Light to a vehicle on Thursday . The Londoner, who worked briefly with Sunderland boss Poyet during his time at Tottenham, has scored goals throughout his club career and has 19 in 55 appearances for England. He has netted 123 Premier League goals for three different clubs during his career in English top-flight football. Sunderland are 16th in the Premier League, just one point above the relegation zone, and Poyet will hope that Defoe will hit the ground running and start scoring immediately and help the Black Cats climb the table. Defoe has an excellent record of starting quickly and has scored on his debut for every club he has played for. Having started his youth career at Charlton Athletic, Defoe was snapped up by West Ham United at the age of just 16 before being loaned out to south coast side Bournemouth for one season, where he netted 19 times in 31 appearances. Gus Poyet (left) worked with Defoe (centre) at Tottenham and is good friends with the striker . Defoe (right) has scored 11 goals in 16 league appearances for Toronto FC since joining the club . Upon his return to Upton Park, Defoe eventually broke into the Hammers side during the 2001-02 season - scoring 14 goals in 31 games. His time at West Ham was extremely successful, with the striker returning 41 goals in all competitions before moving to Tottenham in 2004 for £6million. During his first spell at White Hart Lane between 2004 and 2008, Defoe netted 61 goals in 170 appearances. He then moved to Portsmouth, where he managed 17 goals in 36 matches before returning to Spurs in 2009. A further 76 goals followed for Tottenham before his move to the MLS last year - and Defoe will be looking to add to that tally at the Stadium of Light.

Defoe, 32, has completed a medical and will sign a two-and-a-half-year deal worth £70,000 a week at the Stadium of Light.

"Angel di Maria does not believe that Cristiano Ronaldo would make a sensational return to Manchester United. Ronaldo made a devastating impact at Old Trafford during his six years at the club between 2003 and 2009 and his game has scaled new heights at Real Madrid. However, speculation persists that he could yet be tempted to return to Manchester one day. Angel di Maria says Cristiano Ronaldo is enjoying himself at Real Madrid and won't sign for Man United . The duo played together at the Bernabeu until Di Maria left for United last summer in a £60m move . Di Maria told Radio America: 'I don't think he will come back to Manchester. It is difficult to leave Madrid. It can happen, but I think that he is having a great time and I don't get the feeling that he wants a change. The Argentine winger, who swapped Madrid for Manchester United in a club record £59.7m deal last summer, has also been taken aback by the quality of Wayne Rooney. 'Rooney is an impressive player,' Di Maria added, 'He has this quality, mentality and this hunger to play every game that is incomparable. He plays 90 minutes in every game. 'He is always committed, giving everything in every match. It is he that has surprised me the most, with his hunger and how he commits to every game. He is a player that deserves to be here.'

"Radamel Falcao’s agent has cast fresh doubt on the striker’s Manchester United future by insisting he should play every week. Falcao was left out of the United squad by Louis van Gaal for the Barclays Premier League defeat at home by Southampton on Sunday and Sportsmail  revealed on Monday that the 28-year-old loanee has serious doubts about whether he will be offered a permanent contract at the end of the season. Now Falcao’s representative Jorge Mendes has suggested the Colombia star, who has started just eight games under Van Gaal, would play regularly for any other team and admitted he may leave United in the summer. VIDEO Scroll down to see Louis van Gaal discuss the permanent signing of Falcao . Radamel Falcao has struggled at Man United and there are doubts the striker will remain at Old Trafford .

He is a fantastic player and I think it’s very difficult for Manchester United fans — they have an absolutely brilliant player, one of the very best in the world, who would without any doubt play 90 minutes, every time, with any other club. ‘The truth is, now, we don’t know what will happen. What we do know is that he will play for one of the very best clubs in the world next season, whether that is Manchester United or not. I am 100 per cent sure of that. But you know how football works — we’ll see what happens.’ United have a close relationship with Mendes. He brought them Cristiano Ronaldo 10 years ago and currently represents stars such as goalkeeper David de Gea. Understandably, the Old Trafford hierarchy would like to maintain that relationship but at the moment the benefits of paying £43million to keep Falcao beyond this season do not look obvious. Falcao, pictured against Yeovil in the FA Cup, has only scored three goals since his move to United . The former Atletico Madrid striker has scored only three goals for United and Mendes has revealed there is already interest from Italy, particularly Juventus. Falcao is likely to be back in Van Gaal’s team this Saturday when United face QPR in London. Fellow striker Robin van Persie is struggling with an ankle injury and Falcao is the natural replacement. Another United forward who is finding it difficult to get a look-in under Van Gaal is Adnan Januzaj — and the Belgian is expecting to be loaned out later this transfer window. Last season he was courted by top clubs across Europe and, indeed, the England national team, after breaking through under previous boss David Moyes.","Radamel Falcao was left out of the Manchester United squad on Sunday .

"Xherdan Shaqiri is confident he has made the right decision to join Inter Milan after turning down offers to join the Barclays Premier League in the January transfer window. The Switzerland international joined Inter from Bayern Munich last week and has signed a contract that will keep him at San Siro until June 2019. The 23-year-old midfielder had been strongly linked with a move to England, where Everton, Liverpool and Stoke were reportedly keen to acquire his services. Xherdan Shaqiri has revealed he rejected interest from England to join Roberto Mancini's Inter Milan . Shaqiri was linked with a move to Everton, Liverpool and Stoke but had his heart set on a move to Inter . Inter unveiled Shaqiri on Wednesday and he told the Italian press: 'I had offers from England and Germany but my wish was to join Inter. 'Juventus was also an option but I wanted Inter. 'I spoke to (Inter coach Roberto) Mancini on the phone and he explained the project to me and it really had an impact. 'The choice was very clear. Moreover, the idea to play in a new league fascinated me.' Shaqiri joined Bayern from Basle in 2012 and won two Bundesliga medals and the 2013 Champions League with the German club, but he struggled to establish himself in the first team. The 23-year-old, pictured with fellow new boy Lukas Podolski, could make his Inter debut at the weekend . 'I wan't totally happy at Bayern,' he said. 'I didn't have much playing time. 'But I've learned a lot at Bayern and I will try to make the most of my time at Inter. I need to play consistently in order to prove how much I'm worth. 'I am hungry for success. I can't wait to get started. 'I want to help Inter return to be at the top in Italy and in Europe. I hope that with this jersey I can return to win titles.' Shaqiri could make his Inter debut on Saturday when Inter face Empoli in Tuscany. Inter, who are currently ninth in Serie A, are still alive in both the Coppa Italia and the Europa League, where they will face Celtic in last 32.","Inter Milan signed Swiss playmaker Xherdan Shaqiri from Bayern Munich .

"Roberto Mancini has warned Mario Balotelli he is in danger of wasting his career. The Liverpool striker has scored twice since his £16million summer move from AC Milan and has been linked with a move away from Merseyside during the transfer window. Mancini managed Balotelli at Manchester City and has urged the 24-year-old to get back on track and not become like former Inter Milan striker Adriano, who faded away after a promising start to his career in Italy. Mario Balotelli has struggled since moving to Liverpool for £16million last summer . Roberto Mancini and Balotelli had a bust-up at Manchester City training in 2013 . Mancini has urged Balotelli to realise he is wasting his talent . 'I have not heard from Mario since we worked together at Manchester City,' he told Corriere della Sera. 'He was still a kid when we were together at Inter. He would do anything I asked him and he also behaved well at City. 'It has all gone downward a bit since he left City. I thought he would do well at Milan, but it didn't happen. 'Mario is at risk of following the same path as Adriano.

"Wilfried Bony brought a smile to the face of one young Manchester City fan ahead of his imminent arrival to the club.

And the chance encounter saw March grinning from ear-to-ear as he met up with one of the Premier League's deadliest marksmen. March, who plays for City's academy, could be coming up close and personal with the striker more often in the future after Swansea accepted the Etihad Stadium's outfit for their star asset. Sportsmail understands the initial fee is £25m up front, plus a further £3m if City win the Barclays Premier League, Champions League or FA Cup, though Bony would have to figure in 60 per cent of games in those competitions. Swansea had been locked in talks with the Premier League champions over the structuring of the transfer, with City having to satisfy Financial Fair Play criteria to enable a move for the prolific 26-year-old. But after those issues were resolved, City will now wrap up their move for the striker, who will not be available for selection until he returns from the Africa Cup of Nations. Bony, who has scored 34 goals in 70 games for the Swans, is understood to have agreed personal terms of £100,000 a week on a four-year contract.

"Mats Hummels has told Borussia Dortmund that his loyalty to the Bundesliga club does not rule out a move to Manchester United in future. United want Hummels to shore up their shaky defence and would have to pay around £30million to sign the German World Cup centre-back if he decides to leave Dortmund. The 26-year-old former Bayern Munich player has indicated that joining Louis van Gaal’s side in this transfer window is highly unlikely, but left the door open to a move to Old Trafford. Mats Hummels has warned his Borussia Dortmund loyalty does not rule out a move to Manchester United . ‘I will stick to my way of not promising anything and maybe leave some day, instead of saying I’ll stay forever and then leave all of a sudden,’ said Hummels, who was speaking after Dortmund’s victory over FC Sion on the club’s warm-weather training camp in Spain. ‘I have never said I will stay until 2024 or 2030 or whenever, but I have stayed until today. ‘I'm not really known as someone who travels. I've only been with two clubs in 26 years so loyalty is important to me. Louis van Gaal would jump at the chance to sign Germany defender Hummels if he ever came up for sale .

"Ralph Ellis runs you through what we've learned this weekend, from Emre Can's new deeper role for Liverpool, to the telepathic partnership between Diego Costa and Oscar at Chelsea while Mesut Ozil’s bright cameo against Stoke may be a sign of better things to come from the German star. Elsewhere, Martin Kelly is quietly rediscovering his form at Crystal Palace while Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink is making great strides as manager of Burton. 1. Moving Emre Can into a back three has made a major difference for Liverpool as he gets the scope to start attacks from deep. The 20-year-old, originally signed from Bayer Leverkusen for nearly £10million as a midfielder, frequently stepped forward from the back at Sunderland. With the confidence of two other centre backs to protect him he found a team-mate with 47 of his 51 passes. Emre Can (left) was deployed in a defensive role by Brendan Rodgers against Sunderland . 2. Diego Costa must love working alongside Oscar – Chelsea’s Brazilian playmaker supplied the striker with 10 passes during the 78 minutes both were on the pitch against Newcastle, including the brilliant backheel that set up Costa’s 15th goal of the season. No other Chelsea player gave Costa the ball so many times – but the partnership is a bit of a one-way affair. Costa found Oscar just once. Oscar celebrates giving Chelsea the lead in their Premier League game against Newcastle United on Saturday . Diego Costa added a second for Chelsea just before the hour mark against the Magpies . Costa and Oscar forged a devastating partnership during Chelsea's 2-0 victory against Newcastle . 3. It can’t help Queens Park Rangers in their quest for a first away point of a troubled season on the road that they are continually out worked by opponents.To be fair to Joey Barton, he covered 7.2 miles at Burnley, but next best in terms of distance run was the 6.5 miles of centre half Steven Caulker. Sean Dyche’s side, for whom the ever energetic George Boyd inevitably went furthest with 8.0 miles, had six players in all who beat Caulker’s total. QPR centre half Steven Caulker (left) covered 6.5 miles at Turf Moor, but six Burnley players eclipsed his total . 4. Arsene Wenger will be hoping Mesut Ozil’s bright cameo display against Stoke proves he’s benefited from the enforced rest caused by knee ligament problems that have kept him out since October. The German World Cup winner got on the ball 22 times in a busy 17 minutes after replacing Olivier Giroud and gave it away only twice. Mesut Ozil was full of energy during his 17-minute cameo as Arsenal cruised to a 3-0 victory against Stoke . 5. Marvin Emnes might be the only man at Swansea delighted to see the back of Wilfried Bony as the Ivory Coast striker disappears first to the Africa Cup of Nations and then to Manchester City. The 26-year-old Dutch striker has started just three games in nearly a year since moving to the Liberty Stadium and his handful of appearances off the bench total just 143 minutes. He’s capable of more though – his arrival as a sub against West Ham saw him create the Swans equaliser which the dubious goals committee will award either to Bafetimbi Gomis or as a Mark Noble own goal. Swansea's Marvin Emnes (left) skips past the tackle of West Ham defender Carl Jenkinson . 6. Claudio Yacob could be the big winner from the arrival of Tony Pulis as the new manager at West Brom. The Argentine midfield enforcer was always one of the first names on the team sheet when Steve Clarke was in charge, but had started only once in the Premier League all season before Pulis put him into the team against Hull. The 27-year-old made a difference, only giving the ball away four times as his ability to protect the defence saw Albion keep a clean sheet in a home Premier League game for only the third time all season. Claudio Yacob (left) looks set to benefit from the arrival of Tony Pulis as the new manager of the Baggies . 7. Martin Kelly is quietly rediscovering the form that when he was at Liverpool earned him a solitary England cap. At 24 the Crystal Palace defender is benefiting from playing regular Premier League football for the first time since his breakthrough season at Anfield in 2010-11. Switched to left back against Spurs from his more natural role on the right, he snuffed out the threat of Andros Townsend – winning every one of his six tackles. Martin Kelly (right) is beginning to rediscover the form that earned him a solitary England cap in 2012 . 8. Tottenham youngster Alex Pritchard will be watching the breakthroughs made by Harry Kane and Ryan Mason at White Hart Lane while he spends the season on loan at Brentford. The 21-year-old, among the nominations for League One player of the year when he spent the last campaign with Swindon, has looked equally assured in the Championship and gave another outstanding display in the 1-0 win over Rotherham that kept Mark Warburton’s side in the play-off places. Attacking midfielder Pritchard has played just seven minutes in the Premier League for Spurs, but Mauricio Pochettino’s fondness for promoting homegrown kids might offer him fresh chances when his loan is over in the summer. Tottenham youngster Alex Pritchard has been outstanding for Brentford during his loan spell at the club . 9. Dean Saunders had been gaining a solid reputation in management in the lower leagues until he went to Wolves and everything went wrong. Some 18 months later he’s taken charge of Crawley Town in League One on an interim basis while John Gregory undergoes heart surgery. There are promising signs that Saunders can rebuild his career – the 2-2 draw with high-flying MK Dons made it two games without defeat for a side that had lost three in a row before Deano took charge. 10. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink’s first venture into being a boss in England has started well – a 2-1 win over Mansfield moved his Burton side into second place in League Two with 20 points from the nine games since he took over. The former Chelsea star is encouraging attacking play from all over his team – when right back Kelvin Maynard got the second goal he became the 15th player to score for the Brewers this season. Burton have gained 20 points from their last nine games since Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink took over as boss .","Oscar and Diego Costa combined brilliantly against Newcastle .

"Losing one striker looks unavoidable but the prospect of Wilfried Bony’s understudy also leaving Swansea is a headache Garry Monk could do without. A season that began with a pair of impressive leading men could stutter if Bafetimbi Gomis’ representatives move beyond talking in their courtship of other clubs. The striker revealed on Friday that ‘my agent has been speaking to one very big club’ and ‘it is nice to hear’ of outside interest, with Crystal Palace especially keen on the 29-year-old. Gomis played a key role in Swansea’s equaliser on Saturday but those comments will have concerned Monk after Manchester City on Sunday agreed the £30million transfer fee for Bony.

He has looked sharp, he has looked bright and you can see there is desire and a work ethic. ‘He is my No 1 striker . . . even if Wilfried stays, this is Bafe’s chance to stake a claim for that shirt and if he does well enough he will keep it.’","Bafetimbi Gomis was on target as Swansea drew 1-1 at home to West Ham .

"Gary Neville doubts whether Swansea's powerhouse striker Wilfried Bony is the right fit for title chasing Manchester City. Manuel Pellegrini's side are closing in on a £30million deal to sign the Ivory Coast international, who is currently away at the Africa Cup of Nations. Bony top scored in the Premier League through 2014, beating Wayne Rooney and possible future City team mates Sergio Aguero and Yaya Toure. Bony, who is wanted by Manchester City, and his  team-mates celebrate his goal at Anfield against Liverpool . 'I worry about the purchase of Wilfried Bony, who is a very fine centre-forward but is not certain to add the kind of intricacy and ferocious intensity they found in the Sergio Aguero and Carlos Tevez partnership,' Neville told The Telegraph. Neville added that City, who are unbeaten in the Premier League since the end of October, need greater consistency across all competitions to land titles year on year. 'The owners will want sustained success: back to back titles and a serious challenge for the Champions League. The quality to go again, go again and again,' said Neville. 'There is no doubt City are a good Premier League team. However, for them to be an outstanding team they will have to acquire the consistent intensity you see at the two Madrid clubs or Bayern Munich.' Manchester City look set to sign Wilfried Bony after ongoing talks with Swansea City over a £30million deal . The former Manchester United right back also claims that City, who play Everton on Saturday afternoon, are not at the level from when they won the Premier League in 2012 as they look to outgun table-toppers Chelsea. 'To my eyes they are not as good as when they first won the Premier League. The big question remains: can they handle success the season following a title win. 'The next two months will tell us whether Mourinho can get Chelsea back into the habit of killing teams off, and whether City can win year on year.'

"From a bootless young parent in the Ivory Coast to a £30million target for one of European football’s biggest clubs, via the Czech Republic, Holland and Wales. Wilfried Bony’s career path is one less travelled, but then this is a man who does nothing in a conventional manner. That extends to his dress sense, nightclub conversations and sneezes, which his former Swansea colleague Michel Vorm recalled as being so loud they briefly halted work in the Liberty Stadium reception one day. Vorm added that when ‘he gives you a play punch, he doesn’t realise that it really does hurt’. That’s the powerhouse of a striker who has made a far bigger mark on English football and who will soon achieve the dream he has long held of joining a Champions League club. Swansea striker Wilfried Bony turned up in a rather unique outfit for an interview with Sportsmail last year . Manchester City look set to sign Bony after opening talks with Swansea over a £30million deal for the striker . Bony celebrates after scoring for Swansea against QPR during the 1-1 draw at Loftus Road on New Year's Day . It’s the ambition that he has stated in numerous text messages to his countryman, friend and confidant, Didier Drogba; one that has driven him since he went eyeball to eyeball with his father as a 14-year-old to spell out his own plans for life. Bony grew up as the eldest of three children in the Plateau area of Abidjan, in the south of the Ivory Coast. His father was a teacher and his mother, a black belt in judo, worked in administration. They weren’t poor but they didn’t have much, which is why it was significant when, aged 14, Bony quit the expensive school in which his father had enrolled him two months earlier. In an interview with Sportsmail a year ago - Bony’s first with a British newspaper after his £12m move to Swansea in 2013 - the striker explained how badly the news went down. He said: ‘My father paid for me to go to this school for a year but I said, “I don’t want that, I want to play football. Don’t pay anything”. ‘He would say, “Go to school and after that you can play. There are other people, like doctors, who play football”. But I said, “Dad, no. Everyone has a destiny”. Man, he went ******* crazy. My mum helped me. She bought me boots, black boots, because I used to play without shoes. I used to hurt my feet.’ Former Swansea goalkeeper Michel Vorm admitted to Sportsmail that Bony's playful punches really hurt . After falling out with his father, Bony joined an academy set up by Cyrille Domoraud, the former Ivory Coast defender who played for Inter and AC Milan. Bony is anything but laidback and admits he always has to be in control . Bony used to be a defender, but during one game the academy’s striker was injured and he took his place. Two goals gave Bony’s coach a brainwave. ‘He came up to me and said, “You’re not a stopper any more”,’ Bony recalled. In 2006, aged 17, Bony joined his first professional club, Issia Wazi in the Ivory Coast, and a few months later was invited for a trial at Rafa Benitez’s Liverpool. They liked him but wanted to monitor him rather than offer a contract. Having just had the second of his two sons - they and their mother live with him in Swansea - and with only a few more coins to his name, his instincts were finely tuned to providing instead of waiting. An offer was available to join Sparta Prague there and then, so Bony took it. When he arrived, he saw snow for the first time and thought, ‘What the f*** is that?’ By the time he left in 2008, Bony had learned fluent Czech, could ski and had scored 30 goals in 75 games. He moved to Holland, where he hit 53 in 73 games for Vitesse Arnhem, and then he joined Swansea for an initial £12m and has scored 34 goals in 70 games. Sportsmail understands there was a clash last summer between Bony’s representative and Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins, such was the former’s desire to capitalise on a 25-goal debut season with a transfer. Liverpool were keen. Bony scores past Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart in November as Swansea lost 2-1 at the Etihad . Bony could have forced the issue but he has largely kept faith that Swansea would not stand in his way if a top club made an acceptable offer. That time is approaching, with a £100,000-a-week salary believed to have been agreed. Certainly, Bony will not have sold himself short. But the greatest incentive, he has long claimed, is the desire ‘to show what I am’. That person is a 26-year-old of huge intensity, who once told Sportsmail: ‘I have to be in control - at the end of the season I want to do this, after next season I want to do that. Goals, objectives. Bony, pictured climbing above the Arsenal defence in March, says he always tries to be in the right place . ‘I know who can help me, who can’t help me. The people who can help, from the beginning I talk to them. “If you help me, I help you”. ‘I am quite an intelligent guy and I like to use my power. In the disco or anywhere, I tell my team-mates, “If you have time to put in a cross do it because you know I am good with my head. If I head the ball one time it can be a goal. If I am not there, it is my mistake”. I have absolute belief in myself.’ That extends to believing he can play for the best clubs in Europe. ‘Every player wants to play Champions League football,’ said Bony last night. ‘When you get that opportunity you go on, or not.’ Drogba reinforces the message with texts that read: ‘Don’t let anyone destroy your objectives.’ Bony tends to reply: ‘I will never let anyone destroy my objectives.’ So far he has been true to his word.

"Manchester City have finally welcomed top-scorer Sergio Aguero back to training as they look to increase the pressure on Chelsea. The Barclays Premier League champions have already had a good few weeks, clawing back Chelsea’s lead at the top of the table, signing Frank Lampard until the end of the season and opening talks with Swansea City over the proposed transfer of Ivory Coast striker Wilfried Bony. Now, as revealed in Thursday’s Sportsmail, Aguero has taken his next step towards fitness by returning to full training ahead of this weekend’s trip to Everton. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero plays a pass during a training session on Thursday afternoon . Aguero, with his knee heavily strapped, gets involved in his first full session since being injured in December . Aguero was left in tears after damaging his knee ligaments against Everton in early December . Aguero may well be held back for the Arsenal game a week on Sunday but is pushing hard for a place on the bench on Saturday. Fellow striker Edin Dzeko - recovered from a calf strain - has a better chance of starting, as does captain Vincent Kompany who had a hamstring injury. Meanwhile, the Premier League has confirmed that Lampard is registered solely with City after he reneged on an agreement to join New York City FC in America’s MLS this month. The league is also satisfied that the Premier League champions have not broken any rules over the signing. A Premier League statement read: ‘The Premier League has sought and received assurances from Manchester City that there is no agreement in place between the club or City Football Group with New York City FC relating to the player.'

"Super-agent Jorge Mendes has heaped praise on Cristiano Ronaldo by claiming the Ballon d'Or winner is a great role model for kids. Ronaldo picked up yet another award on Monday when he beat off competition from Lionel Messi and Manuel Neuer to win the prestigious title for the third time. Mendes, who helped Ronaldo seal moves to Manchester United and Real Madrid in 2003 and 2009 respectively, believes the 29-year-old's ambition to reach the top will have a positive influence on youngsters. Cristiano Ronaldo - pictured with his son  - is a great role model, according to his agent Jorge Mendes . The 29-year-old superstar gives his son Cristiano Ronaldo Jnr a kiss during the Ballon d'Or Gala . Speaking after the Ballon d'Or ceremony, Mendes said: 'He is a great professional and that is fundamental today for a player to perform better on the pitch. Cristiano is a professor. 'Cristiano is an example for the boys who want to triumph, who want to go on to become the best in the world. He is also a great example for our society and our country, to make us more determined, more ambitious. He is an example for the youngsters and the adults. 'He has never stood with his arms folded. He always wanted to be better and he has that same ambition today.' Portuguese football agent Mendes, who advises the likes of Angel di Maria, James Rodriguez and David de Gea, insists fellow countryman Ronaldo is the 'best player in history'. 'At the age of 16, he was the best in the world for his age. At 17, too. He has always been the best,' added Mendes. 'People say he is so good because he is strong now physically but, at the age of 16, he was already doing all those amazing dribbles he does, taking on players. He had so much quality. 'He is the best player in history and there will never be another one like him.'

"Each summer Manchester City’s football hierarchy sit down to map out transfer targets for the following 12 months. Back in August, the name of Wilfried Bony was not on the list. That less than five months later the Barclays Premier League champions are now on the verge of signing the Swansea City centre forward says much about how the ebb and flow of a football season can change things but also the enduring financial might of the world’s richest club. It is understood the decision by football director Txiki Begiristain and manager Manuel Pellegrini to pursue Bony was taken just 10 days ago and has been driven less by injury concerns over marquee centre forward Sergio Aguero and more by a growing feeling that third-choice striker Stevan Jovetic may be sold this month. Wilfried Bony scores past Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart in November as Swansea City lost 2-1 . Bony, pictured climbing above the Arsenal defence in March, says he always tries to be in the right place . Stevan Jovetic could be allowed to leave the Etihad this January, paving the way for Bony's arrival . Bony was pictured at the airport on Wednesday as he headed for the Africa Cup of Nations . He was pictured with his agent (right) as he prepared to head out and represent the Ivory Coast . Nevertheless, a mid-season commitment to a £30million outlay on a player who will be away at the Africa Cup of Nations for the rest of this month is remarkable and points once again to just how powerful City can be in the market when they feel the need. One of City’s most prominent objectives in recent times has been to ease themselves away from the image of a club prepared to throw money at everything, that of an organisation hard-pressed to get their heads round what is value for money and what isn’t. Failing UEFA’s financial fair play test last year didn’t help but City’s £200m investment in a new training ground was supposed to help the club draw a line in the sand. This, they told us, is where many of City’s future first-team players will originate. City mean this, too. The club’s owners knew their early habit of cherry-picking players from across the world - often at over-the-odds prices - had a limited shelf life and have actively moved away from such scattergun spending. Sergio Aguero's (left) injury has been one of the factors that have forced City into the transfer market . Edin Dzeko (left), talking to Aguero during City training, has also been out injured . Nevertheless, City’s plans to grow ‘organically’ in the future have been put into realistic context by issues surrounding Frank Lampard and now Bony in the past week. Pellegrini’s desire for Lampard to stay at City longer than was first intended was as clear as it was understandable. The club’s decision to then pull the rug from under the feet of its feeder club New York City FC was therefore something of a no-brainer. To work against the wishes of a coach trying to retain a league title under enormous pressure from Chelsea would have been self-defeating. City, though, will be picking up the pieces of that decision in America for some time to come. The club have spent millions attempting to win friends - and customers - on the other side of the Atlantic, and the Lampard fiasco may well have swept away that goodwill in a single stroke. Yet City clearly felt it was a price worth paying and their attitude reminds their rivals at home and in Europe that the single most important component of their business is winning football matches in England and the Champions League. Stevan Jovetic (left) could be sold this January, paving the way for Bony to arrive while Frank Lampard (right) will stay at City until the end of the season . Bony has interested a number of clubs having scored the most Premier League goals in the calendar yea . Certainly, Bony will help. Strong, powerful and muscular, the Ivory Coast international is similar to Aguero in style and - if he signs - will provide Pellegrini with a like-for-like replacement for the South American when he is missing and a rather impressive partner when Pellegrini decides to play them both. Pellegrini’s current second-string striker Edin Dzeko has his qualities but a consistent goalscorer he is not. By signing Bony, City will bring depth to their striking options that even Chelsea would envy. For all Diego Costa’s excellence so far this season, Chelsea look short when the Spaniard does not play. City, on the other hand, have managed to close the gap on Jose Mourinho’s team in the weeks that Aguero has been injured and if February begins with the Argentinian lining up alongside a new partner, then perhaps the holders may begin to look upon themselves as title favourites for the first time since the season started. Alvaro Negredo (left) was allowed to leave the club at the start of the season to join Valencia on loan . Bony and his  team-mates celebrate his goal at Anfield against Liverpool, who opted against signing the striker . On Wednesday, Aguero was back at Manchester’s Bridgewater Hospital for a check-up on his knee; he may well be on the bench for the game against Everton this weekend, while Dzeko is set to return after calf trouble. With Bony in the ranks, City will have to lose one player from a Champions League roster restricted by UEFA to 21 as punishment for breaching FFP guidelines. That player may well be Jovetic, who is attracting offers the club may well find hard to resist in the current transfer window. UEFA’s punishment for City’s FFP breach also restricted spending to £49m net over this transfer window and the last. However, with UEFA allowing City to take an agreed £25m fee from Valencia for striker Alvaro Negredo, payable this coming summer, into account, they are comfortably within that margin. Bony, therefore, will become the club’s 11th centre forward signed at a combined cost of about £275m since the takeover of August 2008. Proof, perhaps, that the more some things change, the more they stay the same. Manchester City look set to sign Bony after opening talks with Swansea over a £30million deal for the striker .

"Oussama Assaidi's forgettable spell at Liverpool has ended with a move to Dubai side Al Ahli, the Barclays Premier League club have announced. The 26-year-old signed from Heerenveen in 2012 but made only 12 appearances for the Reds, spending time on loan at Stoke last season and this. The highlight of the Moroccan's Premier League career came in December 2013 when his ferocious last-minute strike earned the Potters a dramatic 3-2 win over Chelsea. Oussama Assaidi (right) is leaving Liverpool for Dubai club Al Ahli for a reported £4.7million . The Moroccan winger has failed to make an impact since arriving at Anfield from Heerenveen in 2012 . Assaidi ended his loan deal with Mark Hughes' side ahead of schedule to complete the move to the Middle East for an undisclosed fee, reported to be in the region of £4.7million. The Reds accepted the offer of making a profit on the player they bought for £2.4million and the deal is expected to be completed in the next 24-hours. Meanwhile, the Anfield club is yet to receive an offer for holding midfielder Lucas Leiva who has been linked with Roberto Mancini's Inter Milan during the January window. Despite falling out of favour at the start of the season, the Brazil international has been integral to Liverpool's recent resurgence - leaving the club reluctant to sell him for a proposed £7million.

"The derby clash between Everton and Liverpool next month will kick-off at 5.30pm as scheduled despite opposition from Merseyside Police and the local council, the Premier League has confirmed. The fixture on Saturday, February 7 at Goodison Park, was moved to a tea-time start in order to be televised by Sky Sports - leading to objections from the police, who decided to elevate the game to a Category C fixture, with reference to there being a high risk of disorder. The police, supported by Liverpool City Council's Licensing Committee, wanted the match to kick-off no later than 1.30pm. The kick-off time of the Merseyside derby between Everton and Liverpool remains unchanged - 5.30pm . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard scored as the Merseyside rivals drew 1-1 at Anfield earlier this season . Everton informed the Premier League on December 9 of the police's objections and the issue was then discussed by the council's licensing committee, which initially said it would 'take legal advice on all appropriate options to enforce the position' in the event of no change of kick-off time being determined. However, only if there are concerns over a safety certificate being issued could a change be viable, and that was not a consideration as Everton have confirmed they are in a position to stage the game. And the Premier League confirmed to Mailonline Sport on Monday that the derby will go ahead at the 5.30pm start. Merseyside Police's report last month stressed there was no specific intelligence indicating any organised disorder is planned but stated the wider implications of a late kick-off meant they had to take action.

"The Ballon d'Or may be the most prestigious individual prize a footballer can win, but a deeper look at the voting leaves a feeling of bemusement and frustration. Cristiano Ronaldo may have quite rightly been voted the world's best player on Monday night - his second consecutive win and third overall - and gushed about  Lionel Messi, hailing his great rival for helping him become a better player. But the Real Madrid superstar could not bring himself to include Messi in his top three players in the world, instead choosing to opt for team-mates Sergio Ramos, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema. Cristiano Ronaldo (left) and Lionel Messi did not deem each other in the world's best three players . Ronaldo and Messi (right) spoke positively about each other after the former was crowned the winner .

Ronaldo celebrated with his son Cristiano Jnr on stage after winning the FIFA Ballon d'Or 2014 . FIFA have published the full list of votes from each national captain, manager and media representative . Equally Messi, despite saying Ronaldo deserved to win, voted for Argentina team-mates Angel di Maria and Javier Mascherano and Barcelona buddy Andres Iniesta. Are the world's two best players really that petty that they can't recognise the other's achievements on paper? But let's be clear, Ronaldo and Messi are not the only ones who simply 'vote for the boys'. Vincent Kompany, captain of Belgium, deemed international team-mates Thibaut Courtois and Eden Hazard as the world's two best players with Arjen Robben third. No Ronaldo, no Messi, no Manuel Neuer. Really, Vincent? Ronaldo voted for Real Madrid team-mate Sergio Ramos (centre) as the best player in the world . Messi had Argetina team-mate Angel di Maria (centre) in his top three players in the world . Bastian Schweinsteigher (second, right) included Germany and Bayern team-mate Philipp Lahm in his three . Robin van Persie (No 9) selected Holland pal Arjen Robben (No 11) as the world's best player . Diego Godin, the Uruguay captain, opted for former Atletico Madrid team-mates Diego Costa and Courtois ahead of Robben. Again, no sign of the eventual top three. Germany captain Bastian Schweinsteigher went a step further, picking international and Bayern Munich team-mates Manuel Neuer, Philipp Lahm and Thomas Muller. The trio of course won a Bundesliga title and a World Cup, but did all three really outshine Ronaldo and Messi? Unfortunately, the list goes on. Radamel Falcao, captain of Colombia, put above everyone else James Rodriguez - of, yes, you guessed it, Colombia. Wales captain Ashley Williams opted for Gareth Bale, Robin van Persie went for Robben and Hugo Lloris deemed French team-mate Benzema the world's second-best player. Lionel Messi (Argentina) – 1. Angel di Maria 2. Andres Iniesta 3. Javier Mascherano . Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal) – 1. Sergio Ramos 2. Gareth Bale 3. Karim Benzema . Iker Casillas (Spain) – 1. Cristiano Ronaldo 2.

Gareth Bale 2. Cristiano Ronaldo 3. Bastian Schweinsteiger . *Underlined players are national players . Ultimately what Monday night proved is that football is full of politicking of the highest order, arguably as bad as that seen in Eurovision. Robert Lewandowski, for example, decided to announce on Monday that he regretted voting for Ronaldo ahead of his Bayern team-mate Neuer. 'Voting for Ronaldo instead of Neuer was a mistake,' he told German newspaper Welt. 'I would clearly vote for Neuer now if I had the chance. But I already cast my vote back in August or something. I would vote different now. 'I am sorry for Manu. I am really surprised that he did not even come in second and the big gap to Ronaldo also baffles me. Manuel is an amazing goalkeeper and person.' We can only presume that Lewandowski had seen that his team-mate Schweinsteigher had voted for Neuer and lacked the conviction to stand by his view that Ronaldo is in fact the better player. He offers no reason as to why he had this sudden change of heart, and may be it is as simple as wanting to save face in the dressing room. Let's not forget that men like Lewandowski are leaders of their national teams, yet they act like teenagers voting for the prom king or queen. Radamel Falcao (right) picked his Colombian team-mate James Rodriguez (centre) as the world's best player . Rodriguez was also picked as the top player by Colombia coach Jose Pekerman . Rodriguez won the Puskas Award for the best goal of 2014 at Monday evening's ceremony . Vincent Kompany (right) picked Thibaut Courtois (centre) as the world's best player . Sadly, this trend extends to the managers of national teams too. Gerardo Martino went for an Argentine 1-2-3 of Messi, Di Maria and Mascherano. Yes, they reached a World Cup final but do Di Maria and Mascherano really deserve to be there? Colombia's Jose Pekerman picked as his No 1 player Rodriguez, Belgium coach Marc Wilmots chucked in Courtous at No 3, Deschamps gave his final spot to France striker Benzema and Holland's Guus Hiddink gave the top honour to Robben. Frankly, it is enough to make the stomach churn. Surely, the managers and captains of national teams should be strong enough to pick the best three players in the world regardless of nationality and friendship? And those that did, deserve special praise. Neymar put aside rivalries to pick Ronaldo behind his Barcelona team-mate Messi. By contrast Real's Iker Casillas found no place for Messi but had team-mate Ramos splitting Ronaldo and Mueller. This is no new trend and has been the norm for several years now and all it serves to do is take some of the gloss off what should be a night of celebration for football. Away from the political and tactical voting, there were some eyebrow-raising decisions by certain managers and captains. Here we look at the more questionable voting. Roy Hodgson (England coach) – 1.

The 54-year-old helped end the country's eighteen-year wait for silverware as Germany beat Argentina in the World Cup final courtesy of Mario Gotze's extra-time strike.

'This is not considered to me to be my property but I am just taking it on behalf of the others.' Ancelotti, who arrived at the ceremony with his wife Luisa, had been nominated after achieving 'La Decima' with Real Madrid. In 2014, the Italian helped the Spanish giants win the Champions League, Copa del Rey, Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup. Simeone, meanwhile, guided Atletico Madrid to their first La Liga title in 18 years and also masterminded the club's route to last season's Champions League final in Lisbon.

"James Rodriguez (42%) Stephanie Roche (33%) Robin van Persie (11%) Stephanie Roche has missed out on becoming the first woman to win the FIFA Puskas Award for goal of the year. Colombia's James Rodriguez was declared the winner from a three-strong shortlist including Republic of Ireland international Roche and Dutch striker Robin van Persie.

FIFA presidential award: Hiroshi Kagawa . FIFA fair play award: FIFA volunteers . Over six million fans viewed the goal on Youtube and sparked hopes Roche could become the first woman to claim the coveted award at FIFA's Ballon d'Or ceremony. But despite a concerted campaign Roche was beaten in the public vote by Rodriguez's stunning effort against Uruguay in the 2014 World Cup. Unlike her two rivals for the award, Roche's goal was watched by just 95 spectators and was filmed on a camcorder by Wexford coach John Flood. Roche collected a short cross from the right on her right instep, flicked it over bemused defender Laura Heffernan with her other boot and from 25 yards magicked up a left-footed missile of a volley that found the top-right corner. Following her nomination, Roche left Ireland to join ASPTT Albi in the south of France - though she is soon to leave the club after struggling with the language barrier. Van Persie missed the bash as he stay behind in England to have a scan on a damaged ankle sustained in Sunday's 1-0 defeat to Southampton.

James Rodriguez was this year's World Cup top scorer and this strike illustrates why. Facing their South American rivals in the last 16, the Colombia playmaker collected team-mate Abel Aguilar's looping header on his chest from 25-yards out. One touch later the ball is in the back of the net as the 23-year-old swiveled and hit a venomous, dipping volley which crashed in off the underside of the crossbar.

"Sandefjord will occasionally wear a camouflage-patterned kit they say will show their fighting spirit when the club return to the Norwegian top-flight this year for the first time since 2010. 'It's special. We want to show that we are ready for the battle,' marketing manager Frank Lindahl told the local newspaper Sandefjords Blad. It will be the club's third-choice kit. They will wear a new blue and red design for home matches, and white for most of their away games. Norwegian side Sandefjord have unveiled a camouflage third kit ahead of their top flight return . Not all fans are happy with the choices and some have taken to the Facebook page of kit manufacturer Macron to express their reservations about the military kit, as well as the change from traditional blue to blue and red. 'Military pattern on a football jersey? No thanks, it's really tacky,' posted one irate supporter. Managed by former Blackburn Rovers and Derby County midfielder Lars Bohinen, Sandefjord kick off their campaign at home to Bodo/Glimt on April 6.","Sandefjord have released  a camouflage kit for the new Norwegian season .

"There were plenty of laughs thrown up by this year’s Ballon d’Or gala. There was the look on Lionel Messi’s face when he had to sit through a tribute from coach Luis Enrique, there was the look on Thierry Henry’s face when Cristiano Ronaldo let out his primal scream, and there was the moment when FIFA named the FIFPro team of the year and David Luiz was in ahead of Diego Godin. The battle-worn Uruguayan who failed to make the team of the year despite and incredible 2014 might be overlooked on the world stage but no one at Atletico Madrid is held in higher esteem by coach Diego Simeone. Last year when he knew he was going to lose players from his league winning squad he accepted it. There was only one condition – Godin must not be sold.

Back row from left: Arjen Robben, Angel di Maria, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo were in FIFA's Team of the Year . He marshalled one of the meanest defences in Europe last season, showing the sort of leadership his coach demands from his most experienced players and he scored one of the most important goals in Atletico Madrid’s history. On the last day of last season when Barcelona took the lead against Atletico to move ahead of them in the title race it was Godin who rose unmarked to head home a corner at the start of the second half to put Simeone's side level. He wheeled away in celebration – kissing the badge in front of celebrating supporters – and made sure that the team did not concede in what was left of the game. It was the sixth time Barcelona had played Atletico in what was to be their league-winning campaign and Barcelona's Messi-led forward line had failed to get the better of Simeone’s team on any of the previous occasions. That was largely down to Godin and now they had won the league because of his goal. He scored again in the Champions League final although ultimately it was not enough to see them lift the European Cup. He then went off to Brazil and got the goal against Italy that made sure Uruguay qualified for the last 16. All that apparently doesn’t carry much weight with FIFPro. They preferred Luiz, who was part of a defence that shipped seven goals against Germany. There is no accounting for some people’s tastes.

"Despite the individual honours and the England highs, this ranks as one of the best days in the career of Stuart Pearce. As Ben Osborn rattled in a stunning injury-time winner, the ecstatic Nottingham Forest manager ran onto the pitch. Think that penalty against Spain in Euro 96; think typical Pearce. ‘Psycho is back’, the Forest fans roared in one corner of the iPro Stadium. Pearce threw out his chest, raising an arm high in the air to let them know they are in this together. He has suffered a fortnight from hell but there are signs of life. He looked like his old self.

To come back from a goal down with 15 minutes remaining against a team who had conceded just two home goals since early November is one thing but to do it in your arch-rivals’ back yard is another. These are only three points but the way in which they were earned is rather more important. It appeared more than good enough when Britt Assombalonga swivelled inside the six-yard box to scramble in an equaliser. Pearce spun round to the bench to perform his legendary punching celebration and it got better when 20-year-old Osborn scored his first professional goal. What a place to get it. ‘All my mates are Derby fans, I was getting messages from them last night saying don’t score the winner,’ Osborn, an academy product, beamed. He has bought his boss plenty more time now. And Pearce knows it. ‘I’m entrenched in Nottingham,’ he said. ‘This is more than just a job for me, let’s be honest. I enjoy football at the all-or-nothing end of it. ‘The players realised there’s nothing to fear here, gentlemen.

Attendance: 32,705 (2,645 away) A Derby supporter confronted Forest centre-back Kelvin Wilson at full time, failing to land two punches before being rugby tackled to the ground by Jamaal Lascelles, but nothing could ruin Forest’s day. Oddly, it could all have been very different. Pearce might have found himself staring down the barrel. Danny Mills, who played under him at Manchester City, said yesterday morning that players are not stupid; that they suss his faux motivation early on. The reply was measured: ‘I’m not interested in what Danny’s had to say,’ said Pearce. ‘I do apologise to him for putting Micah Richards in his place at Man City. ‘I know my limitations, as a man, I know my limitations as a coach. I think I’m improving, I’ve got a continual mentality to want to improve game by game and I’m pretty unshakeable in terms of criticism.’ Mills was later proved wrong after Forest had held a pre-match Churchillian team meeting. It looked bad when Henri Lansbury got them off to a torrid start by inexplicably diverting the ball into his own net unchallenged from a corner in the 16th minute. From then until half-time, Forest were a mess. They were nervous, the occasion clearly getting to them. The manager was jittery on the touchline, unable to stand still, and was angered by referee Andy Madley’s refusal to award a penalty when Jake Buxton held Michail Antonio’s shirt at a corner.

But, as so often happens in the Championship, the landscape changed in a flash, leaving Derby manager Steve McClaren fuming: ‘We showed our total immaturity in this game — we got overexcited and lost our shape.’ Derby had been incapable of clearing a routine free-kick and £5.5miilion signing Assombalonga stabbed the ball home inside the six-yard box, sparking delirium. Pearce became even more excited when Osborn waltzed untracked to smash the winner in stoppage time. As the manager ran onto the pitch, he might just have been thinking that this was the moment his career changes for the better.

Here is all the information you need for Manchester City's home clash with Arsenal... Manchester City vs Arsenal (Etihad Stadium) Team news . Manchester City . Manchester City playmaker Samir Nasri faces three to four weeks on the sidelines after suffering a calf injury in training this week. The problem will rule the Frenchman out of Sunday's Barclays Premier League clash with his former club Arsenal at the Etihad Stadium. Midfielder Yaya Toure is on international duty at the African Nations Cup but manager Manuel Pellegrini has declared all other players fit and in contention, including captain Vincent Kompany and strikers Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko.

Fernandinho, celebrating with Sergio Aguero, put Manchester City in front at Goodison Park on Saturday . Arsenal . Arsenal defender Kieran Gibbs is likely to return for the Gunners' visit to reigning Barclays Premier League champions Manchester City on Sunday. Gibbs has been suffering with a heel problem but is expected to be passed fit, while Theo Walcott and Mesut Ozil are also in contention after coming off the bench against Stoke last Sunday.

Alexis Sanchez has been involved in more goals (19 – 12 goals and seven assists) than any other player in the Premier League this season. There have been six red cards in the last nine Premier League matches between these two sides. Arsenal’s away form this season is patchy with four wins, four defeats and three draws in their 11 Premier League road trips. In contrast, City’s home form under Manuel Pellegrini has been impressive with 25 wins from 29 Premier League games under his stewardship at the Etihad Stadium (W25 D2 L2). Arsenal are the only team to score three goals at the Etihad in a Premier League game during Manuel Pellegrini’s reign – but this was in a 3-6 defeat. Only Chelsea (11) have won more Premier League games away at Manchester City than Arsenal (10). Manchester City are unbeaten in their last 12 Premier League matches (W9 D3 L0). Only West Ham (14) have scored more headed goals than the Gunners this season (8). Manchester City have conceded at least two goals in each of their last two Premier League home games. They haven’t shipped two or more goals in three consecutive home Premier League games since October 2002.","Samir Nasri faces three to four weeks out injured with calf problem .

"They came for the Fernando Torres dream debut, they gladly settled for the Sergio Ramos nightmare. The Atletico Madrid striker did not score on his return to the Vicente Calderon but a senseless foul in the area from Ramos gave Raul Garcia the perfect chance to score from the spot and give his side the first leg advantage. Jose Gimenez then rose to head a Gabi corner home doubling Atletico’s first-leg lead in this last-16 Copa del Rey match and deal Real Madrid their second defeat in four days.

Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti brought on the rested Cristiano Ronaldo but he could not rescue Real who conceded again from a corner and could now be heading out of the cup at their hands of their City neighbours having already lost to them in the league and in the Spanish Super Cup this season. They will need a big result next Thursday in the Santiago Bernabeu and Ronaldo will surely start after watching the first half of the first leg from the bench. He saw Real Madrid almost take the lead in the first minute when Ramos got his head to a James Rodriguez corner but headed straight at Jan Oblak. It was Real’s last clear-cut chance of the first half as Gareth Bale endured a frustrating night and Ronaldo was sorely missed alongside him. For Atletico, Torres was full of running and the Calderon roared every time he touched the ball. He was too keen on several occasions racing clear into an offside position as Real’s central defensive partnership of Rafael Varane and Ramos played with a high line despite ‘El Nino’s’ presence and the lightning pace of his strike partner Antoine Greizmann. It was the Frenchman who gave Atletico their first scare when he robbed Varane. As he honed in on goal his France World Cup team-mate Varane recovered brilliant and slid in to dispossess him clearing for a corner. Torres was kicked by Khedira and the German was booked. But the debutant might have gone into the book himself after clashing with Marcelo under the nose of the linesman. He shouted down the same linesman when the flag was raised for another offside. He was as animated as the 46,800 inside willing him to return with a goal. The second half started with Real going close first through James Rodriguez wrongly flagged offside receiving the ball on the edge of the six-yard box and then with Bale running onto a long cross field pass from Marcelo but trying to pass it into the far corner of Oblak’s net and sending it just wide.

It might have been Torres’ magic moment but instead Raul Garcia stepped up and with almost no run up rifled the spot-kick past Navas. The Calderon erupted, and Diego Simeone’s youngest son Giuliano jumped into his arms to celebrate. In the pandemonium the Argentine coach brought on Koke for Torres. The former Liverpool and Chelsea striker had toiled for an hour. He hadn’t scored but he helped create the atmosphere that now looked like carrying Atletico Madrid over the line. Carlo Ancelotti responded by bringing on Ronaldo but a mishit free-kick was the closest he came and with 15 minutes left Giminez rose to make it two and Simeone’s son was back in Simeone’s arms. It was a night for favourite returning sons and for another famous win for Atletico over their neighbours Real Madrid. It was the first time Torres had ever beaten Real Madrid as an Atletico Madrid player and he said: 'There was plenty to celebrate. The atmosphere was great and so was the performance but we know that taking a 2-0 to the Bernabeu is not enough to mean the tie is over. We will have to play just as well there to finish the job.'

"Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino hailed Christian Eriksen's 'big, big potential' after the Dane's late winner sealed a 2-1 victory against Sunderland. Jan Vertonghen's deflected shot gave the hosts a third-minute lead, but the visitors equalised through Sebastian Larsson's superb free-kick, won by former Spurs man Jermain Defoe on his Black Cats debut. Larsson's strike looked to have earned the Black Cats a valuable point, but Eriksen added a late twist when his placed shot from edge of the area went in off the post with two minutes remaining. Christian Eriksen scores a late winner to help Tottenham secure a 2-1 victory over Sunderland . Eriksen was recently named Danish Player of the Year for the second consecutive year . It was the 22-year-old's eighth goal in the Premier League this season. 'I am happy for Christian,' Pochettino said. 'He is still young, but he has big, big potential. He improves every day. I am happy for his performance. 'His contribution is clear. I am happy because he is a very good guy, a good professional and a great player.' Mauricio Pochettino hailed Eriksen's 'big, big potential' after the Dane's goal sealed a 2-1 win . Eriksen battles for the ball with Sunderland winger Adam Johnson who surges forward . Tottenham, who climbed to fifth after the result, should have had a third goal in injury-time, but Vertonghen's effort was wrongly ruled out for offside. Sunderland goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon had gone up for a corner and, as Tottenham broke with speed, Vertonghen was still in his own half when the ball was played to him. 'I think the referee and the linesman were a little bit confused about the rule,' Pochettino said. 'When the pass went to Jan, it was before he had got into the opponents' half. 'It was a quick action, maybe the referee was focusing on another part of the game, sometimes it happens to me. 'It was difficult though because it was 2-1 and it could have decided the game. Maybe I can be in a different mood about it now.' Black Cats debutant Jermain Defoe chases Tottenham centre back Jan Vertonghen . Vertonghen rises highest to pip Sunderland striker Connor Wickham to the ball . Pochettino added: 'Jan is upset because he does not have many opportunities to score and the action was like that of a striker. 'It is difficult to understand why, but we are all human and we can all make mistakes.' Tottenham have earned 10 points this season with goals in the 88th minute or later and Pochettino believes those returns are down to his players' fitness and never-say-die mentality. 'Our fitness is very good,' Pochettino said. 'The club believes that is very important - the sports science and medical staff have done a great job so far. 'And also our mentality. In football you always need to believe. You need to be strong in your mind and you have to always believe it is possible to win the game.' Defoe signed for Sunderland from MLS side Toronto FC on a three-and-a-half-year-deal earlier this month . Gus Poyet speaks to his new signing, who has 19 goals from 55 England caps . Eriksen's decisive contribution ensured an unhappy return to White Hart Lane for Defoe, who had previously scored on each of his club debuts. Defoe struggled to make an impact against his former club before being substituted in the 74th minute, although the 32-year-old could have won a penalty when he tumbled over Vertonghen's planted leg in the first half. 'He started brightly, he was sharp,' Sunderland manager Gus Poyet said. 'If he got the penalty and he scores we're talking about a great debut. 'The referee, though, didn't see what everybody else saw clearly. 'He was looking for his chance and I played him a bit longer than expected. 'He will get better and better and when he gets that first chance he will put the ball in the back of the net. 'It was a good start and a great place for him to start playing for us.' Sunderland's free-kick specialist Sebastian Larsson scores his side's opening goal at White Hart Lane . Hugo Lloris is powerless to stop the perfectly angled strike . Sunderland remain 16th in the table, one point above 18th-placed Hull, who play West Ham on Sunday. 'When the winning goal is so late, it hurts,' Poyet added. 'But it is part of football, you have to be good until the last minute, not the 88th or the 89th.' Sunderland striker Danny Graham sees a late shot saved by Lloris .

"Australia and India players alike embraced the 'Pink Test' on Thursday - an annual event when cricketers celebrate the life of Glenn McGrath's late wife. Jane McGrath died of breast cancer in 2008 and her husband, an Australian cricket legend, has celebrated her life on an annual basis since by wearing pink and encouraging his fellow professionals to sport the bright colour as well. Spectators at the Sydney Cricket Ground also wore pink during the third day of the fourth Test between Australia and India, with McGrath  wearing a pink jacket.

"Danny Murphy thinks Liverpool's treatment of Steven Gerrard 'stinks' and believes the club were keen to get rid of the 34-year-old. The Liverpool captain's July move to LA Galaxy was confirmed on Wednesday by coach Bruce Arena in an interview with the LA Times. But Gerrard revealed he would have committed his future to Liverpool had they offered to extend his terms when he retired from England. Steven Gerrard will become an LA Galaxy player in July, the MLS side's coach Bruce Arena has confirmed . Gerrard's departure from Liverpool 'stinks' according to former Anfield midfielder Danny Murphy . Gerrard was pictured out in Liverpool on Tuesday night to celebrate team-mate Martin Skrtel's 30th birthday . However, having been one of Liverpool's star performers as Brendan Rodgers' side finished second in the Premier League last season, the midfielder was only offered a new deal in November. Gerrard's former Anfield team-mate Murphy believes Liverpool always intended to move their skipper on. Co-hosting the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast, Murphy said: 'You can only be judged on the season you've just played and, last season, he was terrific. He probably felt he'd warranted a new contract at that point. Murphy (right) spent six years playing with Gerrard in the Liverpool midfield  before joining Charlton . 'Liverpool let it get to November or December before they offered him anything. In fact, that offer was only triggered by Stevie going out in the press and saying he hadn't been offered a new deal yet. That says to me that the club, and Brendan [Rodgers], were already thinking about him moving on. 'Each manager has his own opinion and Brendan is not going to come out and say, ""that was my decision"". 'It stinks a bit for me though that they treat a player like that. We saw the same thing with Chelsea and Frank Lampard. Clubs say, ""we have offered him a new deal"" but it's always on reduced wages. 'It's not how you should treat someone who's put their all into a club.'","Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard will join LA Galaxy in January .

"Arsene Wenger has urged star man Alexis Sanchez to produce a big performance away from the Emirates Stadium in his battle with Sergio Aguero on Sunday. Two of the deadliest attacking threats in the Barclays Premier League go head-to-head when Arsenal travel to Manchester City. Sanchez has been a revelation since joining from Barcelona in a £30million summer move, scoring 18 goals for the Gunners. However, only four of those have come away from home, while he was not quite up to his usual high standards in the matches at top-four rivals Liverpool and Chelsea. Alexis Sanchez, pictured after scoring against Sunderland, has found the net just four times away from home . The Arsenal frontman has been urged to produce a big performance away at Manchester City on Sunday . Sanchez (left) and his Arsenal team-mates look dejected after conceding away to Swansea in November . ‘Yes, at Chelsea and Liverpool he wasn’t at his best,’ admitted Wenger. ‘It’s maybe because the team has not been as effective away from home, because when you are a striker you depend a little bit on how much your team pushes forward. ‘But he can use that as a motivation to play well on Sunday. As a team we didn’t play well as we would like (against Liverpool and Chelsea) and it was difficult for the strikers to get good balls. But he has had some good away games, too.’ Arsenal legend Thierry Henry — who will make his debut as a Sky Sports pundit for the clash at the Etihad Stadium — said this week that Sanchez has the potential to be Wenger’s best ever signing. Producing a match-winning display against Manuel Pellegrini’s side on Sunday would further those claims. Sanchez celebrates by punching the air after scoring during Arsenal's home victory against Stoke on Sunday . ‘It’s difficult to compare Laurent Koscielny, for example, with Sanchez,’ said Wenger. ‘All the signings we made this year were good. Sanchez is one of the better ones, but you have to consider the price you pay as well to decide that because we paid good money for him. ‘But whichever way you look at it, he is good value for money. He is one of the fastest to adapt to the Premier League. I believe it’s because he feels accepted by the other players, that he feels he is an important player.’ Victory against the champions will provide Wenger’s men with a huge confidence boost in their attempts to finish in the top-four. Per Mertesacker has a word with Mesut Ozil following Arsenal's 6-3 defeat at the Etihad in December 2013 . Their record against English football’s elite remains a concern for Wenger, who admits three points over City could be a pivotal moment in their season. ‘We are going through a period where confidence is important,’ said the Frenchman. ‘So a big performance could be decisive. I feel we have to play with a bit more freedom. From every big game you gain confidence when the result is good. Let’s focus on going there and giving ourselves a chance to win by putting a great performance in. ‘We want to have a good balance between attacking and defending because we know that City attack very well.’ Arsene Wenger believes victory over Man City would prove to be a pivotal point in Arsenal's season . Meanwhile, Wenger confirmed the signing of Legia Warsaw midfielder Krystian Bielik, pending a successful medical. Bielik arrived in London on Friday to complete his move. Wenger insists the fee for the 17-year-old is less than the £2m that has been touted — but admitted it was a hefty sum to fork out for one so young. ‘It’s an awful lot of money for a player if he doesn’t succeed,’ said Wenger. ‘If he does succeed then it’s cheap. He’s a defensive midfielder, 6ft 2in, he has a good energy level and technical level. It’s a gamble. But on what we saw it’s worth to take the gamble. He will go straight into the first-team squad.’","Alexis Sanchez has scored just four times away from home this season .

Forward Podolski is set to join the Serie A side on a temporary deal after falling out of favour with Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger. And Matthaus, who led West Germany to World Cup glory in 1990, believes the 29-year-old must devote more time to football and less to social media if he is to get his career back on track in Italy.

Speaking to Sky Germany, Matthaus said: 'Lukas has his qualities; now he must prove them by bringing them back to the pitch. 'In the past we heard how he tweets more than he plays. He needs to concentrate on football.' Podolski decided to respond to Matthaus - via Twitter - choosing to make reference to the 53-year-old's five marriages - four of which failed.

"For professional sportsman, there is not much worse than the serious injury. It makes defeats and mistakes on the field of play seem as trivial as, in the wider context, they often are. What is often overlooked, however, is the daunting nature of the recovery period. The hours of lonely rehab, the moments when competitive action seems as far away as ever and – worst of all – the often unspoken fear that the body may never quite work in the same way again. There is only cure, of course, and that is time spent back in the arena, on the field of play, in combat. Only time back in the thick of it clears the doubts from the mind and allows sporting instinct to return. On a cold night at Turf Moor, Sam Vokes took an enormous step forward with a goal that will have finally helped him feel like a footballer again. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats as Burnley force FA Cup replay with Tottenham . Burnley's Sam Vokes jumps in the air after scoring his side's equaliser against Tottenham . Tottenham goalkeeper Michel Vorm looks behind him to see Vokes' shot hit the back of the net . Kieran Trippier congratulates Vokes after the striker scores past Tottenham's Vorm . BURNLEY: (4-4-2) Heaton 6; Trippier 6, Keane 6, Mee 6.5, Laffery 6.5; Kightly 6, Marney 5, Arfield 5, Boyd 6 (Wallace 78mins 6); Barnes 5.5 (Vokes 60mins 7), Ings 6 (Sordell 78mins 6) Subs not used: Gilks, Jutkiewicz, Reid, O'Neill .

Subs not used: Friedel, Dier, Naughton, Capoue, Onomah . Goal: Chadli 56 . Booked: Stambouli . MOTM: Sam Vokes . Referee: Roger East 6 . Attendance: 9,348 . For the uninitiated, Vokes was one half of the centre forward partnership that propelled Burnley towards promotion from the Championship last season. While the other half, England's Danny Ings, has been busy cementing his reputation in the Barclays Premier League recently, Vokes has been recovering from a cruciate knee injury suffered last March. The Welshman's contribution this season had been 10 unremarkable minutes as a substitute in the home defeat by Liverpool on Boxing Day. Burnley manager Sean Dyche, aware of the dangers associated with the specific injury, had been holding back a player who had started to strain at his leash. Vokes was given another opportunity as his team trailed to Tottenham and, only 13 minutes after coming on, he watched a cross arrive from the right side and then simply let instinct take over, swivelling naturally to sweep the ball right-footed across goalkeeper Michel Vorm and in to the far corner of the goal. For Vokes it was a landmark moment and it may well transpire to be so for Burnley, too. For parts of this season so far, Dyche's team have looked a little short of goal scoring threat and, despite the recent efforts of Ashley Barnes, the sight of Vokes and Ings back in harness can only brighten the mood in this part of Lancashire. 'When someone has waited that long to come back from a very serious injury, this is fantastic,' said Dyche. 'We are delighted to see him back. It's very important we look after his recovery but this is a huge step on his journey.' For the neutrals, it was just good to have a story, something to talk about. For almost an hour, this was perhaps one of the worst games of football this stadium has ever witnessed. Is it possible for nothing to happen in a whole half of professional football? Perhaps not. But certainly there was nothing of significance. No shots on target, no saves (obviously) and nothing that remotely resembled progressive intelligent football. Tottenham goalscorer Nacer Chadli celebrates with Harry Kane and Mousa Dembele after opening the scoring . Chadli celebrates with his Tottenham team-mates after scoring the first goal of the match . Both managers had picked strong teams and deserve credit for that. Not until the start of the second half, though, did either team begin to do justice to the decision to take the game, and the competition, seriously. It was Tottenham who showed first after the interval and their improvement owed something to the half-time introduction of their latest hero Harry Kane. The young striker’s evening was to end badly but initially he was influential, his energy and direct running threatening to bring the best – if such a thing exists – out of the lumbering Roberto Soldado. Soldado fluffed two chances before Tottenham took a lead they perhaps deserved through Nacer Chadli in the 56th minute. Ben Davies did well down the left side and when his cross found Chadli in a yard or two of space, the Tottenham midfielder was able to take a touch before finishing powerfully and accurately from 12 yards. At that point, Burnley had shown nothing to suggest they would get back in to the game and had Kane not seen a low shot rebound back from the knees of Burnley ‘keeper Tom Heaton shortly after Chadli’s goal then that probably would have been the end of the game. As it was, Burnley sensed opportunity as the game drew on and Ings had already brought a save from Vorm prior to Vokes’ equaliser. Before the end Kane had an opportunity to add to his reputation but skewed his shot dreadfully across goal in added time. This time it was somebody else’s night.

"Gary Anderson might have just defeated the best arrow thrower in the sport’s history and landed a £250,000 cheque but he plans to celebrate with nothing more extravagant than a day of home improvements. ‘I’ll be getting some sleep and then I’ll get my tool belt on at home to do some DIY,’ he said, ‘There’s always something that needs doing around the house.’ The heavy hitter from Eyemouth in the Scottish borders came from behind to beat Phil Taylor and become his country’s first world darts champion since Les Wallace 18 years ago.

Lady luck was not on his side as his darts bounced out of the board repeatedly and he was embroiled in a dispute with a member of the crowd. But he regained his composure to clinch the biggest win of his career, beating 16-time champion Taylor 7-6 with a double 12 finish. ‘I’m proud to be a Scotsman,’ said Anderson, ‘I live in Somerset now but it makes it a bit more special to win for my home country. It hasn’t really sunk in yet. Maybe by about Wednesday or Thursday I’ll have realised what I’ve done.’ The atmosphere was electric when Anderson was introduced but it paled in comparison to the wall of noise that greeted Taylor’s arrival on the giant blue Alexandra Palace stage. His signature tune The Power rang out as he applauded his adoring audience. The song by German group Snap! was released just days before Taylor won his first world title 25 years ago. His cheque for that victory was £12,000. The prince of the Potteries uncharacteristically missed 55 shots at doubles but he believes he can disprove the doubters. ‘I’m going to get better next year and that’s a promise,’ said Taylor, ‘I’ll put things right.

Anderson, competing in only his second PDC World Championship final, betrayed no sign of nerves, starting the set with 120 and hitting the bullseye for a 121 finish. Like all great champions, Taylor raised his performance when on the ropes. A set and two legs down, he held his nerve to win the second set. Celebrating by giving Anderson a playful tickle on the chin was perhaps not befitting such a champion. It was the sort of immature provocation that, in reverse, Taylor has been known to fume over but the Scotsman simply grinned. Anderson raced to a 3-1 lead but Taylor responded with a masterful display of throwing and nerveless finishing to comfortably take the fifth and sixth set and draw level. The momentum seemed to swing behind the Englishman, who won the seventh set. Anderson fought back to level at four sets apiece then somehow managed to win a drama-filled ninth set. First he went from 180 to zero in less than a second, knocking out his first two darts with his third. Then came the dispute with a member of the crowd that saw Anderson gesturing angrily towards the individual who was whistling at him as he was on the oche.

I think he got his just reward by being asked to go home early so he missed the rest of the match.’ Anderson composed himself and got back in front. Then, playing on a new board after tournament director Tommy Cox ordered a replacement, he went two sets clear with a 98 checkout. Gesturing towards Rachel, who gave birth to his third son nine months ago, he seemed to signal that he had the win sewn up. That appeared to spur Taylor into action as the 54-year-old raced to victory in the 11th set. Taylor played the sort of supreme pressure darts which have seen him amass career earnings of more than £6million to take them into a deciding set but even his greatness could not stop Anderson rolling on to lift the trophy .

"In one of those Sliding Doors scenarios, Kieffer Moore would awake on Monday morning as the newest FA Cup hero. He would survey the empty champagne bottles, the booty of a rollicking night before, while his mobile telephone beeped urgently with missed messages. Every media outlet would want him, and every available parking space in his street would be occupied by outside broadcast vehicles. His head would be hurting, as much from his hangover as the whack he received in the first half. The bandaging would still be on, but askew, and as he opened the door to fetch in the milk, a barrage of flashbulbs would explode before his furiously blinking eyes.

Here he is, the man who dumped Manchester United out of the FA Cup; the striker who stunned the wealthiest club in the land. The bandaged bandito, the fastest gun in the west. From Truro City to Wembley Way. Kieffer Roberto Francisco Moore. Late of Dorchester Town, now the talk of Yeovil Town - and many points beyond. Not. For, back in the real world, it doesn't happen like that. Not at all. In the 55th minute, when Samuel Foley's cross falls to Moore in front of Manchester United's goal, he does not finish like a Ronnie Radford or Ray Crawford. He panics, he snatches at it, he scuffs his shot. The ball rolls harmlessly to goalkeeper David de Gea, with all the venom of a back-pass. Moore is 22 and has only recently returned from injury. He is a tireless worker, but not the most clinical presence in the penalty box. 'He gave it a go,' said his manager Gary Johnson, sympathetically. 'There was nothing more to give.' And so the best team win. Not the best team on the day, necessarily, because Yeovil's battling qualities should not be underestimated, and the scoreline flatters Manchester United a little; but the best team, because United were the only ones that looked like scoring and when Moore missed that chance the occasion assumed an air of inevitability. The players that Louis van Gaal has assembled were bound to break through sooner or later. Sooner, as it transpired. Just nine minutes after Moore's fluff, Ander Herrera provided a lesson in the taking of opportunities. Of course that is the difference between shopping for players with a budget of £30,000 at Dorchester - as Johnson did when buying Moore - and purchasing one of the finest young midfield players in Europe for £29million from Athletic Bilbao. Wayne Rooney played the ball square to Darren Fletcher and his pass to Herrera was cut out by the extraordinarily hard-working Simon Gillett, the pick of Yeovil's tenacious midfield. Unfortunately, this intervention only succeeded in teeing the ball up for Herrera. It sat nicely before him and he struck a first-time shot that dipped and flew into the top corner, leaving goalkeeper Jed Steer with no chance. It is testament to Yeovil that, despite this setback, and the overwhelming odds, they refused to lie down.

Moore and McNair sport bandages during the FA Cup third round ficture following a sickening clash of heads . In the 72nd minute, a header from captain Joseph Edwards — a Manchester United fan, he got Rooney’s shirt at the end — needed to be cleared from the line by Angel di Maria. That name alone shows what Yeovil were up against. Di Maria did not start the game, but came on as a second-half substitute for Radamel Falcao. Yeovil are bottom of League One. You do the maths. So it was one of those rare occasions: credit to all and everyone home happy. The locals know they had a fair and courageous swing at it, but didn’t expect to win anyway; the travellers from Manchester knew their millionaires had been in a game but rose to the challenge. Van Gaal later said that Rafael and Luke Shaw had suffered significant injuries early in the game, but soldiered on to half-time. Fans respect that. Of course, a 2-0 win at Yeovil is no less than is expected, but the FA Cup finds out the fainthearted soon enough — just look at Queens Park Rangers’ result on Sunday — and United treated Yeovil with the respect they, and the competition, deserved. From the first minute when Moore gave De Gea a clump to see if he fancied the physical challenge — he did, although his kicking was poor — it was clear that Yeovil were up for the scrap. A brutal 21st-minute clash of heads ended with Moore and Paddy McNair patched up by bandages and staples, and in the first half United were never allowed to settle. Their opportunities were greatly limited, a Rooney shot after 15 minutes, one from James Wilson that required a save 17 minutes later.

Simon Gillet attempts to hold off the challenge of Luke Shaw as Yeovil looked to attack Van Gaal's side . United had more control after half-time, but without creating a great number of chances. It was only when Yeovil pressed for an equaliser that United added emphasis to the scoreline with a second, scored by Di Maria on the break. Yeovil lobbed a free-kick into the area, it was cleared and Rooney played a quite lovely pass out to the flank that Di Maria seized on breaking down the left. He drew Steer and then lifted the ball over him perfectly. They won’t have seen too many finishes like that in League One and for good reason: Di Maria’s £60m transfer fee probably amounts to more than the total expenditure of every League One club combined. Yeovil’s total budget is £1m and that doesn’t buy goals. This much was plainly obvious on Sunday. They have scored on just five occasions in the league at Huish Park and while United’s back line can be unconvincing they are still a considerable step up from the sort of defences that have held strong down here. In the 73rd minute, Edwards fed Moore, but his shot deflected wide. It wasn’t his day. As Johnson spoke about the bravery of his players, his words were momentarily drowned out by Sir Alex Ferguson’s helicopter taking off from a nearby field.

"Fernando Torres is much-maligned for his poor scoring record at Chelsea, where his 46 goals cost more than £1million per strike. Now he has returned to his boyhood club Atletico Madrid, surely his fortunes will improve, right? Well if his first training session on loan from AC Milan is anything to go by, perhaps not. In front of the cameras in Majadahonda, at Atletico's training ground, Torres struggled to hit the target - scoring just one of his five headed attempts in a shooting drill. Fernando Torres sprinted through hoops before directing five headers at goal, unfortunately only one went in .

The Spaniard connects well with the header, as two Atletico Madrid coaches watch on from the side . Unfortunately, the ball ends up wide of the target, leaving the coach stretching to receive it . Fernando Torres' goalscoring record at Chelsea does not look good: . Premier League: 20 goals in 110 games . Domestic cups: 7 goals in 19 games . European competitions: 19 goals in 43 games . Total: 46 goals in 172 games . The clip will fuel Chelsea fans' views that ridding themselves of 'El Nino' was the right decision, while Atletico coach Diego Simeone will have a tough job on his hands instilling confidence back to the Spanish striker. At Liverpool he was prolific, proving himself worthy of a £50million move to west London in 2011. He scored 65 goals in 102 appearances at Anfield, and became a fans favourite in his three-and-a-half years there. But where did it all go wrong? Simeone will, of course, be hoping that a return to the club where it all began and where he scored 84 goals in 214 matches will ignite something in Torres, a passion that will inspire him to score plenty in La Liga. But, for now, it seems Torres is still unable to find the back of the net. Torres started his career at Atletico Madrid, where he is pictured coming up against Real Madrid's Raul Bravo .

"Ahead of this weekend's Premier League action, Sportsmail will be providing you with all you need to know about every fixture, with team news, provisional squads, betting odds and Opta stats. Here is all the information you need for Tottenham's home clash with Sunderland... Tottenham vs Sunderland (White Hart Lane) Team news . Tottenham . Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino is likely to welcome back a host of first-team regulars for Saturday's visit of Sunderland. Spurs made seven changes for their FA Cup third-round replay win over Burnley on Wednesday night and the likes of Harry Kane, Federico Fazio, Christian Eriksen and Hugo Lloris should all return against the Black Cats. Pochettino also confirmed Emmanuel Adebayor will be in his squad having not played since November whilst Erik Lamela (calf) and Ryan Mason (hamstring) are doubtful with Nabil Bentaleb away on international duty with Algeria. Provisional squad: Lloris, Vorm, Friedel, Walker, Naughton, Rose, Davies, Dier, Fazio, Kaboul, Yedlin, Vertonghen, Chiriches, Stambouli, Dembele, Paulinho, Capoue, Eriksen, Chadli, Lennon, Townsend, Soldado, Adebayor, Kane. Harry Kane was yet again on target for Tottenham as the north London side lost against Crystal Palace . Sunderland . Jermain Defoe could be handed a Sunderland debut at former club Tottenham on Saturday after completing his move from Toronto. The 32-year-old England international is included in the squad after signing a three-and-a-half year deal with Jozy Altidore heading in the opposite direction, and will be joined by fit-again frontman Steven Fletcher following his recovery from a groin problem. However, central midfielder Liam Bridcutt is suspended after his sending-off against Liverpool last weekend and natural replacement Lee Cattermole is still out with a groin injury, as is full-back Anthony Reveillere, who needs another week to shake off an Achilles problem. Provisional squad: Pantilimon, Mannone, Jones, Van Aanholt, O'Shea, Brown, Vergini, Coates, Rodwell, Gomez, Larsson, Johnson, Buckley, Alvarez, Mavrias, Giaccherini, Wickham, Fletcher, Defoe.

Sunderland managed to net two goals despite only having one shot on target in the reverse fixture at the Stadium of Light earlier this season against the Londoners. Tottenham are unbeaten in their last nine Premier League games against the Black Cats (W6 D3). Defeat last time out against Manchester City (2-3) ended a run of five on the road without loss for the Black Cats in the Premier League (W3 D2). It also ended a run of four consecutive clean sheets away from home. Jermain Defoe is all smiles during his first training session as a Sunderland player .

"Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino insists once again relegating Roberto Soldado to the bench will not break the misfiring striker's confidence. The £26million forward has scored just once in the Premier League this season and has lost his place in the first team to in-form Harry Kane. Soldado returned to the side for Tottenham's FA Cup third-round replay against Burnley on Wednesday but missed a golden opportunity to notch just his fifth goal in all competitions since the start of the campaign. Tottenham striker Roberto Soldado (right) missed a chance to score with the goal gaping against Burnley . The Spain international reacts to the miss by dropping to his knees as White Hart Lane . The Spain international is likely to find himself among the substitutes for the league visit of Sunderland on Saturday and Pochettino has no qualms about dropping the 29-year-old. 'It's always hard for the player when he misses this chance,' he said. 'It's okay because he feels that his team-mates, the club and us (the coaching staff) support him. Maybe he will have another opportunity to score? We have no worries about him because he showed after 90 minutes that he played very good for the team. 'He knows that there are opportunities for everyone (to play). We have a lot of games ahead and it's not a question if you miss a chance whether you play or not play. If I decide tomorrow he will go to the bench it will not affect his confidence.' The forward is likely to start on the bench on Saturday having managed just one league goal this season . Pochettino scoffed at suggestions bringing in a psychologist could help Soldado's current mindset and believes the framework is already in place at the club to support the player. 'It's not about psychology,' the Argentinian added. 'We see the player and the people and the holistic situation. It's about all. It's not a case to fix to bring in a psychologist from outside. 'The better psychology for him is from us; we are the people with him all of the time. In football, sometimes there is a good chance to score, but it's not a psychology problem.' Mauricio Pochettino scoffed at suggestions bringing in a psychologist could help Soldado's current mindset . Jermain Defoe is likely to feature against his former club after completing a deal to join Sunderland on Friday. The 32-year-old enjoyed two spells at White Hart Lane and remains a favourite among supporters but was not considered for a return to north London, with Pochettino pleased with his striking options. 'I am happy with Harry Kane because he scores,' said the Spurs manager. 'I am happy with Soldado, he didn't score but I am happy too. I am happy with (Emmanuel) Adebayor and all players. After I need to pick the best players for each game.' Ex-Tottenham striker Jermain Defoe signed for Sunderland on Friday and is set to face his former club . Adebayor has not featured for Spurs since a 2-1 defeat to Stoke on November 9 and has also spent time in Africa having been granted compassionate leave in December. But Pochettino rubbished claims the striker has fallen out of favour and insists he can play a part, starting against the Black Cats. 'I explained before, the relationship is good and that is why I pick him tomorrow,' Pochettino said. 'He has been training (since coming back from Africa). We train very hard and sometimes we play with the Under-21 players and have games and try to re-produce the same situation as a game. 'When we have players who come back from injury that have not played we analyse the game so we can re-produce the same intensity and the same distance.'","Roberto Soldado has scored just one Premier League goal this season .

"An 23-year-old 'Russian spy' has been detained in Ukraine amid claims Vladimir Putin is seeking to destabilise the country. Ukrainian authorities say Maria Koleda was on her ninth mission to the ex-Soviet state, wounding three people with firearms and training two armed subversive groups. The detention comes on the fourth day of a stand-off in two cities, as Ukraine's government warned it was prepared to use force against pro-Russian activists who barricaded themselves inside government buildings and begged Vladimir Putin for back-up. 'Spy': Ukraine has accused 23-year-old Russian social worker Maria Koleda of working for Moscow. Photos have emerged of her holding a rocket-propelled grenade launcher in a floral dress and stroking a kitten . Accusations: Koleda has been nicknamed Bagheera after the cunning panther in The Jungle Book . Authorities say Koleda, who was detained in the Kherson region bordering Crimea, was involved in a plot to 'capture sensitive facilities' including a hydropower plant. Photos of emerged of her in camouflage clothes stroking a kitten and in a floral dress clutching a rocket-propelled grenade launcher. Russia annexed Crimea last month and the U.S. has accused the Kremlin of trying to do the same thing in eastern Ukraine by funding 'provocateurs' to stir unrest so it can invade. Moscow has been accused before of using young female agents - notably the glamorous Anna Chapman, formerly married to a British man before being unmasked by the FBI in New York - in frontline intelligence operations. Koleda uses the nickname Bagheera online - thought to be based on the cunning black panther in Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book. She used firearms during unrest outside Mykolaiv Regional State Administration in southern Ukraine, in which she admitted 'that she wounded three people', said the SBU  (Ukraine's secret service) in a lengthy statement naming Koleda. Kiev claimed she had orders from Russian intelligence to check places where Russian troops could penetrate from Crimea onto Ukraine's mainland, 'bypassing the checkpoints'. Russia has been accused before of using glamorous female agents, notably Anna Chapman, pictured . Ukraine's secret service claimed Koleda, pictured, used firearms and wounded three people . Detained: Ukrainian authorities claimed Maria Koleda was on her ninth fact-finding mission to the country . When she was detained she carried 'a traumatic pistol' with live ammunition and 'guidelines for training subversive groups'. 'She said this was her ninth trip to Ukraine,' said an SBU statement which claimed to have evidence of her reporting to her spymaster in Russia about pro-Moscow activists equipped with 'unlimited supplies of explosives'. The 23-year-old graduated as a social worker from a Moscow university. 'What we see from Russia is an illegal, . illegitimate effort to destroy a sovereign state and create a contrived . crisis with paid operatives' - U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry . Like Katia Zatuliveter, suspected by MI5 of working for Russian intelligence after securing a job with MP Mike Hancock, she had lived in St Petersburg. Russia's FSB - part of the former Soviet-era KGB - did not comment on Koleda's detention. Ukraine presidential candidate Yulia Tymoshenko warned Moscow is deploying tightly-knit agent provocateur groups to control protests which have no popular legitimacy. 'The techniques are absolutely the same,' said the ex-premier. 'Out of 250 people, there are groups of three-to-four FSB representatives, then foremen, who obey them. 'They do not rely on support from the people at all' The development came as masked pro-Russians who stormed Ukrainian state buildings and declared a new 'People's Republic' called on Vladimir Putin for help. The U.S. has accused the Russian administration of funding the 'illegal' unrest which is ongoing in the cities of Donetsk and Luhansk. 'What we see from Russia is an illegal, illegitimate effort to destroy a sovereign state and create a contrived crisis with paid operatives', U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said yesterday. And Ukraine's government warns it is prepared to use force against the activists, who reinforced barricades using sandbags, razor wire and car bumpers and declared a sovereign 'People's Republic'.

East v West: Unrest has flared in eastern Ukraine, whose residents have strong ethnic ties to Russia. Last month Russia annexed Crimea - and now separatists in Moldova say they want to join Russia too . 'Of course we must ask Russia to take . us in because I don't see an alternative,' said a man who claimed he . was the 'commandant' of the seized ex-KGB building in Luhansk. He shouted: 'Putin help us!' Last . night 56 'hostages' were allowed to leave the building amid claims they . had been held against their will and the building had been rigged with . explosives. There was later confusion as to whether there had been any . hostages at all. Today, some of the activists were in talks with the Ukrainian authorities on how to dispel the tension. Serhiy Tyhipko, a figure with the previous Ukraine government, urged authorities not to storm the building in Luhansk but negotiate a peaceful solution instead. Tyhipko said the protesters wanted to turn Ukraine into a federal state with broad regional autonomy, not join Russia. 'Putin help us!' This pro-Russian activist in Luhansk said his name was Vasily and he was the 'commandant' Hostilities: In Luhansk it was claimed up to 60 hostages were taken and the building was rigged with explosives. Conflicting reports said the 'hostages' were released and that there had never been any at all . Prepare for battle: Molotov cocktails are lined up next to the barricades in Luhansk. Force could soon be used . 'The people are not bringing up the . issue of breaking off from Ukraine and are not calling for the help of . foreign countries,' Tyhipko said. Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said the standoffs must be resolved within the next two days. 'I want to repeat that there are two options: political settlement through negotiations and the use of force,' he said. 'We are ready for both options.' Yesterday 70 activists were arrested in a third city, Kharkiv, after Ukrainian special forces stormed their barricades and cleared the building. But the move led to a punch-up in the Ukrainian Parliament in Kiev after one politician accused the government of being too 'heavy-handed'. The views by a communist leader infuriated two nationalists, who marched across the chamber and grabbed him mid-speech prompting several other politicians to trade blows.

"Noel Hunt's first-half double helped Ipswich climb back into the Sky Bet Championship automatic promotion places with a 3-1 victory over relegation-threatened Millwall. The Irish striker notched twice in the first 14 minutes and, after Magaye Gueye's effort at the end of the first half had halved the deficit, substitute Jonathan Parr wrapped up the win late on for the Tractor Boys - who moved up to second in the table. Millwall began brightly as new signing Diego Fabbrini, on loan from Watford, dragged the ball wide of the left post from inside the box after his initial shot was blocked. Noel Hunt's two first half goals for Ipswich put them on the road to victory in their encounter with Millwall . Ian Holloway's struggling Millwall side have won just once in their last eight games in all competitions . But less than 90 seconds later Stephen Hunt lobbed the ball over the defence allowing Noel Hunt, who signed a permanent deal with the club this month, to latch onto the loose ball and finish under David Forde from close range. Hunt tapped in for his second of the game eight minutes later after a dangerous cross found its way to Kevin Bru. Bru saw his shot parried straight into the path of the Ipswich forward who gladly helped himself to his third Championship goal of the season. Millwall's new-look defence - containing debutant Shaun Cummings and 19-year-old academy graduate, and captain for the day, Sid Nelson - looked shaky as the visitors peppered the box with testing crosses. The hosts did eventually play their way into the game but Jimmy Abdou screwed his shot horribly wide after Gueye's lay-off on the edge of the area. And the struggling Lions grabbed a lifeline on 42 minutes when Stefan Maierhofer flicked on for Gueye, who saw his shot creep in off the post. Millwall's Stefan Maierhofer (right) fouls Ipswich defender Tyrone Mings in Saturday's clash at the Den . Millwall began the second half with the crowd behind them as they looked to earn their first win at The Den since a 1-0 triumph against Cardiff on October 25. And they continued to threaten. On 57 minutes Gueye put in a dangerous corner towards centre-back Byron Webster, who could only direct his header narrowly wide. The Ipswich squad had been hit by illness and it looked like the home team would take advantage. Gueye was proving the main threat for Ian Holloway's men and the French winger saw his 20-yard free-kick go narrowly over Bartosz Bialkowski's crossbar. Mick McCarthy's men moved up to second in the Championship table after their victory against the Lions . Ipswich tried to counter Millwall's second-half superiority and Tractor Boys manager Mick McCarthy sent on new signing Freddie Sears. The striker almost made an immediate impact as he broke away from the Millwall defence, but he saw his shot bravely blocked by Nelson. Sears did make a decisive contribution on 75 minutes, though, as his pass set fellow substitute Parr free to comfortably slot past a helpless Forde - extending Ipswich's unbeaten away record to seven games in all competitions.","Mick McCarthy's men moved up to second in the Championship after win .

"Bournemouth moved a point clear at the top of the Sky Bet Championship table thanks to a 2-0 win at Rotherham after Derby had tasted defeat at home to Nottingham Forest. Tommy Elphick and Callum Wilson were on target as the Cherries bounced back from last week's loss against Norwich to make it six wins from their last seven league games. Derby went into the early match joint top and took the lead through a Henri Lansbury own goal, but Britt Assombalonga levelled for Forest and Ben Osborn's stoppage-time strike gave the visitors a 2-1 victory.

Ipswich moved up to second thanks to a 3-1 success at Millwall, with Noel Hunt bagging a brace for the Tractor Boys and Jonathan Parr also netting, while the Lions could only reply through Magaye Gueye. Lee Tomlin struck both goals as Middlesbrough beat Huddersfield 2-0, while Andre Gray scored as Brentford prevailed 1-0 at Brighton, who had Lewis Dunk dismissed. There was no dream start for new Charlton boss Guy Luzon as the Addicks were thrashed 5-0 at Watford, with Odion Ighalo hitting a double for the Hornets and Craig Cathcart, Troy Deeney and Daniel Tozser also on the scoresheet.

However, Alex Neil's honeymoon period at Norwich continued as they survived a Cardiff fightback to win 3-2 at Carrow Road, with Gary Hooper, Kyle Lafferty and Cameron Jerome putting the Canaries in control before the Bluebirds rallied through Alex Revell and Kadeem Harris. Bryan Ruiz bagged a stoppage-time winner as Fulham edged out Reading 2-1, with Pavel Pogrebnyak having earlier equalised Alex Kacaniklic's opener. Fulham attacker Bryan Ruiz (right) celebrates his match-winning goal with teammate Cauley Woodrow . Leeds claimed a late point in a 1-1 draw with Birmingham, with a Paul Caddis penalty putting the Blues ahead early on at Elland Road before Luke Murphy levelled on 86 minutes. Sheffield Wednesday had substitute Sam Hutchinson sent off as they went down 2-1 at home to Bolton, with Liam Freeney and Darren Pratley on target for Wanderers before Chris Maguire pulled one back for the Owls from the spot. Dave Edwards and new signing Benik Afobe struck late on as Wolves beat Blackpool 2-0, while Wigan and Blackburn shared the spoils in a 1-1 Lancashire derby draw, with James McClean equalising for the Latics after Corry Evans had put Rovers ahead.

"The cash controversy that disrupted Ghana's 2014 World Cup is set to be made into a film where 'someone like Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson' saves the day by delivering money to the unhappy players in Brazil. The Ghana squad, including former Chelsea midfielder Michael Essien, were close to boycotting their final Group G match against Portugal over a row about appearance money. Ghana President John Dramani Mahama intervened by flying in £1.8million in cash to pay the team the night before their clash with Portugal and Bugeater Films, an American production company, have decided to turn the dispute into a movie. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sulley Muntari hand out money to the needy in Brazil . The cash controversy that disrupted Ghana's 2014 World Cup during the summer is set to be made into a film . Former Sunderland striker Asamoah Gyan celebrates scoring Ghana's second goal against Germany . Screenwriter Darryl Wharton-Rigby admits 'someone like Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson' should save the day . 'Football and the players needing the money is kind of the backdrop to the story,' screenwriter Darryl Wharton-Rigby told the BBC. 'But it's really about the journey of the guy who actually is entrusted to deliver the money and what happens if he doesn't get it there in time. 'I actually want the guy who's the hero of the story to be from Ghana. I think there should be a hero who is African telling the story.' The players reportedly received about £60,000 after refusing to train and Wharton-Rigby is keen to make the film as realistic as possible. Ghana's Christian Atsu during a press conference on the eve of their Group G match against Portugal . 'It's very much truth stranger than fiction,' he added. 'I saw footage of the police cars taking the money on the highway and you can just see that scene playing out in your mind with someone like Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as the guy having to save the day. You can see all kinds of mayhem happening on the highway. 'It's 50-50 as to whether it will get made, we're still at the early stages so we're going to take it one step at a time. Hopefully we can write a great script and get someone who is attached to it. It's a fascinating story and I think audiences internationally would really take to it.

"Marco Fu lit up the Alexandra Palace with a sparkling 147 maximum break on the first night of the Dafabet Masters. The 37-year-old from Hong Kong fired in the third perfect break of his career as he beat Stuart Bingham at the historic London venue. Fu moved 3-1 ahead with his magnificent clearance and went on to triumph 6-3, setting up a possible shot at Ronnie O'Sullivan in the quarter-finals. Marcu Fu made a maximum 147 break during his 6-3 victory over Stuart Bingham at the Masters on Sunday . The only previous Masters maximums had been posted by Canadian Kirk Stevens, against Jimmy White in 1984, and China's Ding Junhui, in his match with Anthony Hamilton in 2007. World number 10 Fu completed the overseas hat-trick, and there was scarcely a moment in the break when he looked troubled. He celebrated with a fist pump, handshakes for referee Brendan Moore and Bingham, and a wave to the crowd, before walking off for the mid-match interval. Fu returned to fire in two more centuries, both more modest runs of 103, on his way to a classy victory. Fu's previous maximums came against Ken Doherty at the Scottish Masters in 2000 and in World Open qualifying in January 2012, when Matt Selt was his opponent. The latest feat will earn him a £10,000 reward unless it is matched during the tournament, which runs until next Sunday, in which case Fu will have to share the bounty. Bingham was knocked out of the Masters on Sunday by Fu in the round of 16 . Fu will tackle defending champion Ronnie O'Sullivan on Thursday if the 39-year-old world number three sees off Ricky Walden on Tuesday. Shaun Murphy earlier booked his place in the last eight by holding off a Mark Selby fightback to take a 6-5 victory from a gripping match. Murphy, world champion in 2005, had led the reigning Crucible king 5-1, despite an opening 100 from his opponent. He was shaken when Selby roared back to level, aided by breaks of 120, 54 and 92. Selby toppled Murphy 6-1 in the semi-finals at Alexandra Palace last year, but this would be Murphy's day in the capital. New father Selby, whose wife Vikki gave birth to their first child Sofia in November, has won three previous Masters titles, in 2008, 2010 and 2013. Shaun Murphy reached the quarter-finals of the Masters after a thrilling 6-5 victory on Sunday . Yet when the 31-year-old from Leicester could not sink a black in the decider he offered Murphy the big opportunity he was longing for. The Sale-based potter suddenly looked sharp and a snappy break of 40 put him 51 points ahead with 35 left on, with Selby left to scratch around for a handful of snookers. They would not come and Selby's race was run when Murphy knocked in the final red. Murphy said: 'At 5-1 I knew it wasn't over because I've seen Mark come back so many times. He's the worst player on tour to have a lead against, because he relaxes and goes for his shots, and most of them go in.' Murphy beat 2014 world champion Mark Selby to ensure his place in the last eight of the tournament . The 32-year-old added, according to worldsnooker.com: 'Apart from missing a black at 5-3, I didn't feel as if I did that much wrong. The balls went messy in the last frame and when I got a chance I felt as if I had one arm tied behind my back. Snooker can be like that sometimes.' Beaten Selby said: 'I dug in and turned it around and I was confident at 5-5. But every credit to Shaun because he made a good break in the last frame.' Monday's Masters schedule sees Judd Trump and Stephen Maguire go head to head in the afternoon and former champion Neil Robertson tackle Robert Milkins in the evening.","Marcu Fu beat Stuart Bingham 6-3 at the Dafabet Masters on Sunday .

"'Private army'? Ukrainian forces in Kharkiv today. Russia has accused a U.S. firm of providing help . Russia claims 150 Americans have been sent to Ukraine by a U.S. firm with historic links to Blackwater - the private security contractor which made headlines after a mass shooting in Iraq. The Foreign Ministry in Moscow today condemned the use of a supposed private army by Greystone Ltd 'disguised' as local forces. Greystone, which claims it recruits from the world's top armies and police forces, was founded in 2004 as an affiliate of Blackwater before breaking away to become a standalone firm in 2010. Four former Blackwater security guards are . facing trial in the U.S. over a 2007 shooting which killed 14 people in . Baghdad. The statement by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs came as the Kremlin - which is facing international condemnation for sending troops into Crimea - warned 'civil war' could be looming in eastern Ukraine. It condemned the arrest today of 70 pro-Russian activists who stormed a government building in Kharkiv, just 25 miles from the Russian border. Russia, which has 40,000 troops on its side of the border, claimed the 'crackdown' was 'against the policies of the current government in Kiev'. The statement then added: 'Of particular concern is the fact that in this operation are about 150 American specialists from the private military organization ""Greystone"", disguised in the form of units of the ""Falcon"". 'Organizers and participants of this provocation are taking on a huge responsibility to create threats to the rights, freedoms and lives of civilians and for the stability of the Ukrainian State. 'We call for the immediate cessation of any military preparations, which could lead to the outbreak of civil war.' Scroll down for video . Escalation: The statement made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Moscow (pictured) was widely reported . East v West: Unrest has flared in eastern Ukraine, whose residents have strong ethnic ties to Russia. Last month Russia annexed Crimea - and now separatists in Moldova say they want to join Russia too . The Wall Street Journal . reported Greystone had categorically denied deploying anyone in . Ukraine. An article quoted representative Coreena Taylor saying: 'We do . not have anyone working in Ukraine nor do we have any plans to deploy . anyone to the region.' However, Greystone gave no comment when contacted by MailOnline today at its head office in Chesapeake, Virginia. Blackwater was controversial after it received public money to protect U.S. officials in Iraq. But it made headlines globally in 2007 for a shooting which killed 14 people in Baghdad. Four former Blackwater security guards are . facing trial in the U.S. accused of manslaughter, attempted manslaughter . and gun violations. Prosecutors are due to claim they held 'deep hostility' towards Iraqi civilians and did not act reasonably in the heat of the moment. A U.S. Justice Department filing said the guards' views were 'openly . expressed to other Blackwater personnel and exhibited through their . deliberately reckless actions'. The guards' defence is expected to state that they believed they were under hostile fire. The trial is due to begin in June. Pressed . on whether the comments reported by the Wall Street Journal was . accurate or officially sanctioned, a representative replied: 'This is officially . sanctioned: We have no comment.' A U.S. State Department spokesman said it could not answer for a private company, but added: 'We do not have any U.S. military units in Ukraine.' Greystone started work in 2004 'as an affiliate of what is now Xe Services,' according to its website. Xe . Services was a new name for Blackwater, which was founded in 1997 but . changed its name in 2009. It has since changed its name again to . Academi. Greystone broke away from Xe Services in 2010, and set up as a standalone firm. Last month MailOnline reported videos which had surfaced on Youtube - with Russian language descriptions - which claimed to show 'Blackwater' soldiers roaming the eastern city of Donetsk. Asked whether the men seen in the videos could be Academi employees, Dr . Nafeez Ahmed, a security expert with the Institute for Policy Research . & Development, said: ‘Difficult to say really. It's certainly not . beyond the realm of possibility - Academi have been deployed in all . sorts of theatres.' Analysts fear that if an American . firm did have direct involvement in Ukraine, it could give the Kremlin . justification for sending in its troops. But Dr Ahmed added: ‘Of course the other possibility is it's all Russian propaganda.’ Armed and masked: A Ukrainian policeman stands guard in the country's second-largest city Kharkiv, where special forces ousted activists from a government building (pictured) and arrested 70 people today . Today Dr Ahmed, who is employed by a not-for-profit organisation studying global conflict, told MailOnline: 'It's impossible for outside observers to determine the veracity of Russian claims about Greystone mercenaries. 'The problem is that no independent sources are corroborating this narrative which is either coming directly from the Kremlin, or being promoted by Russian news agencies which we know have been used as propaganda tools before. 'It's impossible to determine the veracity of the claims... The problem is that no independent . sources are corroborating this narrative which is either coming directly . from the Kremlin, or being promoted by Russian news agencies which we . know have been used as propaganda tools before' - Dr Nafeez Ahmed, Institute for Policy Research & Development . 'However, what's clear is that both Russia and the United States have been interfering in Ukraine over the last decade as they compete for geopolitical influence in one of the most critical energy crossroads in the region, if not the world. 'The war of words we now see between Russia and the US over the Greystone allegations could be a disturbing prelude to the escalating destabilisation of Ukraine.' Today . British Foreign Secretary William Hague fired a broadside at statements . by the Kremlin - saying the unrest in Ukraine has 'all the hallmarks' of a Russian campaign. He told Parliament: 'There can be no . justification for this action, which bears all the hallmarks of a . Russian strategy to destabilise Ukraine. 'Russia should be clear that the deliberate escalation of this crisis will bring serious political and economic consequences.' NATO has also stepped up its rhetoric against Russia. Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told a press conference today: 'If Russia were to intervene further in Ukraine it would be a historic mistake. 'It would have grave consequences for our relationship with Russia and would further isolate Russia internationally.'","Russian Foreign Ministry said there were around '150 American specialists'

"Jimmy Walker has a two-shot advantage at the top of the leaderboard going into the final day of the Sony Open in Hawaii. The 36-year-old, who triumphed at the Waialae Country Club last year, made his move by carding a fine 62 on day three to become the first outright overnight leader of the weekend. Walker recovered from a bogey on his second hole of the day to register four birdies on the front nine, before really finding his form after the turn.

"Emily Scarratt has won the prestigious Rugby Union Writers' Club Pat Marshall Memorial Award as the sport's personality of the year for 2014. Jonny Wilkinson and Brian O'Driscoll have also been honoured, receiving the RUWC's discretionary Special Award for their services to rugby during distinguished careers. Emily Scarratt is recognised after playing a key role in England's World Cup triumph in France . The awards will be presented to Scarratt and Wilkinson at a gala ceremony in central London on Monday night, with O'Driscoll unable to attend due to family commitments. Scarratt is recognised after playing a key role in England's World Cup triumph in France last summer that saw her contribute 16 points in the final as Canada were dispatched 21-9, a haul that included a dazzling solo try. The 24-year-old from Lichfield, who can play outside centre or full-back, finished as the tournament's top points scorer with 70 and has amassed 55 caps since making her debut against the United States in 2008. Wilkinson won the The Special Award after retiring from rugby at the the end of the 2013-14 season . She becomes the second woman to win the award after England team-mate Maggie Alphonsi was honoured in 2010. Scarratt was joined on the four-strong shortlist by World Cup captain Katie McLean. Completing the quartet were Wilkinson and Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt, who steered the Irish to the 2014 RBS 6 Nations title and a clean sweep of autumn victories over South Africa, Georgia and Australia in his first full year in charge. The Special Award has been won by Wilkinson and O'Driscoll to mark the end of two outstanding playing careers after the British and Irish Lions duo chose the end of the 2013-14 season to retire. England's World Cup-winning fly-half Wilkinson and Ireland's all-time great O'Driscoll were named personality of the year in 2002 and 2009 respectively and now follow in the footsteps of Lawrence Dallaglio, the only other player to have won both awards.","Emily Scarratt named the sport's personality of the year for 2014 .

"Sam Burgess delivered his most impressive performance so far in rugby union, as the code-switcher scored his first senior try and was named man of the match in Bath’s powerful victory over Wasps. The Yorkshireman, starting at inside centre, crashed over early in the second half at The Rec, helping his side wash out the bitter taste left by last week’s defeat at Leicester. Tries from Francois Louw, Semesa Rokoduguni, Matt Banahan and Ollie Devoto completed the rout but Burgess was the name on everyone’s lips, as the rookie continues to develop his embryonic game under the world’s eye.

The former rugby league superstar's rugby development is taking place in the spotlight . ‘Sam played his best game but he’s still a long way from where he needs to be,’ said Bath director of rugby Mike Ford. ‘He didn’t do everything right but it’s still early days. Straight away he came up and talked about how he needs to get better defensively.’ It was the Burgess show in the opening quarter.

And in the 52nd minute he got his try. Running a line off George Ford, he evaded Jacobs, escaped the clutches of Alapati Leiua and Rob Miller and wriggled under the posts. ‘I was glad to get the monkey off my back,’ he said. ‘To slide over the line in front of the crowd was pretty good. 'We spoke in the changing rooms that I might pop up on a wide haul and George managed to find me with a great pass. ‘The game wasn’t as slow as last week and I think that suited not only myself but the team as well.

"Jonathan Trott completed his tour-de-force double-century in England Lions' run-drenched stalemate with South Africa A in the first unofficial Test at Paarl. Trott (211no) batted almost 11 hours, hitting 17 fours from 403 balls, as his team established a first-innings lead before eventually declaring on 624 for eight in reply 504 for eight in late morning on the fourth and final day. A fourth career double-hundred was a personal triumph for the painstaking Trott, South Africa-born and back on the ground where he made his first-class debut as a teenager 15 years ago. Jonathan Trott drives the ball during his impressive unbeaten 11-hour knock of 211 runs off 403 balls . Trott's knock helped to lead the Lions to 624-8 declared in a match against South Africa A . His efforts helped the Lions out of a spot of bother too, from 67 for three at one stage, as he and a succession of partners piled on the runs. James Vince played an important part with the first of five half-centuries from number five downwards, to complement Trott's immovability at number four. The captain was therefore able to resume on 176 out of a day-three stumps total of 507 for six alongside Liam Plunkett. The fast bowler duly became the third of four Yorkshire players to pass 50, reaching his milestone before mishooking Chris Morris to long-leg to end a stand of 106. Young Durham seamer Mark Wood made only five, but number 10 Jack Brooks joined in with a career-best 53 not out - only his second first-class 50, from just 37 balls and containing five fours and two sixes - before Trott called time to see if his bowlers could make any inroads in just over two sessions remaining. On a stubbornly docile surface, they could not. Trott made only his fourth career double-hundred in the match against South Africa A . First-innings centurion Gihahn Cloete was undone by marginal low bounce to go lbw to Boyd Rankin, and his fellow opener Stiaan van Zyl was caught behind by Jonny Bairstow off the leg-spin of his Yorkshire team-mate Adil Rashid. But after the hosts reached 92 for two at tea, Trott and his opposite number Rory Kleinveldt agreed a draw.

"Sam Burgess scored his first Aviva Premiership try for Bath as the title contenders brushed off Recreation Ground visitors Wasps in bonus point fashion. Former rugby league star Burgess struck 45 minutes into the contest, which highlighted his most effective performance since he entered the union code as a second-half substitute against Harlequins six weeks ago. The high-profile union convert proved a prominent figure in attack and defence as Bath triumphed 39-26 on the back of further tries from flanker Francois Louw, wings Semesa Rokoduguni and Matt Banahan, plus substitute Ollie Devoto, while fly-half George Ford kicked 14 points.

Play-off challengers Wasps collected a losing bonus point, which had looked unlikely when they trailed 39-12. Late scores by Ben Jacobs and Alex Lozowski added to earlier touchdowns from Alapati Leiua and number eight Nathan Hughes, while Lozowski booted two conversions and Andy Goode one. Bath's latest league win meant they moved just one point behind leaders Northampton following Saints' 20-7 loss against Sale Sharks on Saturday. And it gave them just the lift they required after last Sunday's defeat at Leicester before resuming European Champions Cup business with a crunch pool clash in Toulouse next weekend. Bath showed a number of changes from the side beaten by Leicester at Welford Road six days ago, including starts for centre Jonathan Joseph, prop Nick Auterac and number eight Leroy Houston. Semesa Rokoduguni (left) speeds away from Wasps' Josh Bassett to run in Bath's  opening try at The Rec . Rokoduguni's fellow winger also got on the board with this try which Joe Simpson couldn't prevent . Wasps were forced into a late switch when wing Sailosi Tagicakibau was sidelined by a strained hamstring, so Josh Bassett was promoted to the starting line-up. Burgess was prominent during the initial flurries, twice making ground in midfield as the home side looked to start strongly against opponents who had moved impressively into play-off contention. Burgess also shone through a couple of crunching early tackles, announcing his presence in no uncertain terms just three weeks before a possible run-out for England Saxons against Irish Wolfhounds in Cork. And Bath's momentum was rewarded after 11 minutes when they breached Wasps' defence following sustained pressure, with Louw bouncing off a would-be tackler and touching down bethween the posts for a try that Ford converted. Wasps' early problems were not helped by flanker Sam Jones going off injured - he was replaced by Ashley Johnson - and Bath continued to dominate the territorial battle, helped chiefly by centre Jonathan Joseph's creativity. England fly-half George Ford kicked 14 points as Bath went within one point of the Premiership lead . Bath secure an uncontested line-out in their high-scoring victory over Wasps on Saturday . But Wasps pounced from their first notable attack after Jacobs' strong midfield run left the Bath defence in disarray, and he linked impressively with Hughes, who delivered a scoring pass to Leiua. It was a wake-up call for the home side, yet they responded through a Ford penalty 12 minutes before half-time, and then delivered a stunning try from deep inside their own half. Turnover possession found its way to full-back Anthony Watson, whose angled run stretched Wasps, and then Ford sent Rokoduguni sprinting away on a 50-metre break. Rokoduguni just made it to the line, appearing to suffer a hamstring injury as he neared Wasps' line. Ford converted, but the England wing was then forced off and Olly Woodburn took over from him as the interval approached. Alapati Leuia scored the first of Wasps' four tries to earn the now Coventry based side a losing bonus point . Wasps could not establish any momentum following Leiua's try and a second Ford penalty opened up a 15-point advantage at the break, leaving Bath firmly in charge of the contest. Bath were in no mood to take their foot off the accelerator immediately after half-time, and more sustained pressure resulted in the impressive Ford sending Burgess over from close range. Hughes replied with a try for Wasps shortly afterwards, yet Bath were not to be diverted from their quest for a five-point maximum, which arrived midway through the second period through a trademark power-packed Banahan score. Wasps just could not cope with wave after wave of Bath attacks, and Devoto added another touchdown - Ford converted from the touchline - but the visitors finished strongly through tries Jacobs and Lozowski that said a great deal about their character.","Rugby league convert Sam Burgess gave best performance so far .

"England Lions remain on course to begin their tour of South Africa with victory after closing day two of their tour match with a Gauteng Invitation XI 307 runs ahead in Soweto. On a day where 19 wickets fell, the tourists built on the platform they had been given by centuries from Sam Robson and Adam Lyth on Monday to move to 443 all out in their first innings. In reply, Gauteng were dismissed for a paltry 179 inside 50 overs, with Durham seamer Mark Wood taking four for 29, and although England stuttered to 43 for three second time around, they are still firmly on top in this tour opener. Jonny Bairstow reaches his half century as England Lions take a commanding lead against a Gauteng XI . Alex Lees failed to become England's third centurion of the innings on Tuesday morning, dismissed for 85 in the second over of the day after edging Keith Dudgeon to second slip. Jonny Bairstow batted well with the lower order, bringing up his half-century shortly before fellow Yorkshireman Adil Rashid edged behind off Nono Pongolo for 11. Bairstow eventually retired out for 62, with five fours and a six, before England were all out for a commanding total. Gauteng limped to 46 for four in reply as Liam Plunkett, Jack Brooks, Boyd Rankin and Wood each took a wicket. Adil Rashid drives straight during day 2 of the England Lions' tour of South Africa . Bradley Dial and Sizwe Masondo showed some backbone, but just as they were settling into their stride, the former was bowled by Brooks for 23 and after the tea interval the hosts' captain fell for 27 after flashing Plunkett to gully. That left Gauteng on 104 for six and in serious arrears, but Brian Barnard and Pongolo staged a mini-recovery in the final session. Barnard thumped Rashid over long-on twice for back-to-back sixes and crashed a four back over the bowler's head for good measure off the next delivery. But the leg-spinner would have his revenge by bowling the batsman, who top-scored for Gauteng with 39, while Pongolo was on his way soon after for 36 when he was clean bowled by Wood, who ran through the tail with three wickets in nine balls to dismiss the hosts in 49.3 overs. England captain Jonathan Trott had decided against an earlier follow-on to give his batsmen more practice . That left the Lions with a sizeable advantage of 264, although captain Jonathan Trott opted against the follow-on preferring to give further practice to his batsmen. That backfired slightly as Robson was dismissed for one, while James Vince added just six before he fell to the last ball of the day. In-between, Lyth contributed 25 from 29 balls and although he too was back in the pavilion before the close, Trott, playing in England colours for the first time since the 2013 Brisbane Ashes Test, was unbeaten on 10.","England Lions are 307 runs ahead of a Gauteng Invitation XI on day two .

"England batsman Jonathan Trott will continue to try to revive his Test career on his first overseas tour since leaving the Ashes in Australia with stress issues just over a year ago. The 33-year-old is captain of a 15-man England Lions squad, which begins a month-long tour of South Africa on Monday. Trott will lead the team in a three-day warm-up match against an invitation side in Soweto and two four-day games against South Africa A this month. He is not in the squad for the five one-day games that follow. Warwickshire batsman Jonathan Trott will captain England Lions during their tour of Australia . Trott, pictured at his home in Birmingham, left last winter's Ashes Tour with a stress-related illness . The South African-born batsman has said his selection for the Lions squad would help his bid to return to England's test team. 'I am like everyone else playing county cricket in that I have aspirations to play for England,' he said. 'I remember going on previous Lions trips in 2007 and 2008 and having to do my time on those and prove myself. That is something that I need to do again.' Trott returned to cricket last year after months of therapy following his decision to leave the 2013-2104 England tour to Australia, saying he was 'emotionally and mentally spent'. He departed the tour after the first test in Brisbane in November 2013, returning briefly to the game with Warwickshire at the start of the last county season, only take another break.

'I had a ""situational anxiety"". It is pretty common with regard to everyday life, but when played out in front of the world media and press it is quite a big thing,' Trott said. 'Cricket is cruel and kind to you at the same time. It is a game you definitely love, but sometimes you question why you do it. I have found myself in a situation where I am enjoying it again.' Trott was back among the runs after his second comeback but, despite strong performances in the limited-overs matches as well, did not make England's provisional squad for the World Cup next month.

"Joe Hockey is sticking by his comments that rich people spend more on fuel than poor households. The government wants to reintroduce twice-yearly indexation of the fuel excise, a budget measure opposed by both Labor and the Greens who say it will hit low-income families the hardest. But the treasurer disagrees, saying there there was a clear trend that showed the higher the household income, the more fuel taxes were paid. Scroll down for video . Joe Hockey said rich people spent more on fuel than poor households and poor people don't drive cars . 'The poorest people either don't have cars or actually don't drive very far in many cases,' he told ABC Radio in Brisbane on Wednesday. That comment drew a rebuke from Labor leader Bill Shorten and some welfare groups. 'Are you serious, Joe Hockey? Are you really the cigar chomping, Foghorn Leghorn of Australian politics where you're saying that poor people don't drive cars?' Mr Shorten told reporters in Perth. St Vincent de Paul Society chief executive John Falzon said the treasurer was making a massive assumption. 'In fact many low-income households are heavily dependent on quite old motor vehicles that are not terribly fuel efficient as their only means of transport,' he told Fairfax Media. The Federal Government wants to reintroduce twice-yearly indexation of the fuel excise . On Wednesday, Joe Hockey brushed off the controversy surrounding his comments . Cheaper housing was also often located in areas that were poorly served by transport, but far from jobs, so they have to travel long distances at times. When quizzed by reporters in Perth later on Wednesday, Mr Hockey was unrepentant, labelling the reaction to his comments as 'hysteria'. 'The fact is that there is a clear trend in Australia - the higher the household income the more fuel taxes are paid by the household,' he said. His office also released figures that showed average weekly expenditure on petrol ranges from $16.36 for those on the lowest income to $53.87 among the highest incomes. Households in relatively disadvantaged areas were also less likely to own motor vehicles than those in relatively advantaged areas. Where motor vehicles were owned, households in relatively disadvantaged areas were most likely to own only one car whereas households in relatively advantaged areas were more likely to have two or more motor vehicles.","Joe Hockey made the comments on ABC Radio in Brisbane on Wednesday .

"For a truly breathtaking sight, just look to the skies above Utrecht in the Netherlands.

'[Before] it was too dark already or there were too many buildings or trees in the frame,' Van Stijn told MailOnline. 'Many times the starlings just flew as a flock and didn't show the dancing. 'This time I finally got everything right - and even better, it was just five minutes from my home.' The nature-lover had been visiting the site for three years in hopes of recording a good video of the birds . 'This time, I got everything right,' he says. 'And even better, it was just five minutes from my home.' 'Every year the birds flock somewhere else,' he explains. 'This suburb has a flock every year, but normally smaller flocks. 'This flock is really amazing: huge and not that common.' While it is common to see starlings in the Netherlands, it's rare to see this many all in one place .

"News Corp chief executive Rupert Murdoch saw Tony Abbott's proposed $5.5 billion paid parental leave scheme before his fellow Coalition members. A month before the plan was announced in 2010 without the consultation of his party colleagues, the Prime Minister sought out the advice of Mr Murdoch on the controversial policy. The consultation took place at a dinner while Mr Murdoch was in Australia and allowed the magnate to drum up support among his Australian-based editors. The book claims Mr Murdoch considered paid parental leave to be a 'visionary' plan which would even help his own employees at his Australian-based operations, reported The Australian Financial Review. Scroll down for video . Tony Abbott (above) turned to Mr Murdoch before his own colleagues for advice on whether to introduce his paid parental leave scheme while opposition leader in 2010 . Rupert Murdoch (left), was told about Tony Abbott's paid maternity leave plans so he could gather support among his Australian-based editors. The meeting happened over dinner while the U.S. based mogul was in Australia, according to Treasurer Joe Hockey (right) in the biography, 'Hockey: Not Your Average Joe' Details of the private meeting are revealed in a biography of Treasurer Joe Hockey 'Hockey: Not Your Average Joe'. Mr Hockey claims in the book that Mr Abbott only mentioned the scheme to him as 'a brief add-on in a telephone conversation, with no specific date or details attached', before it was announced. 'They were encouraged to support it (Murdoch's editors), notwithstanding that it represented a tax impost and was skewed to be of most benefit to parents outside their middle-Australian readership,' he says in the book. 'This fact was unknown to members in the party room, who condemned Abbott’s solo policymaking on such a fundamental issue.' Despite Mr Hockey's claims he was not given specific details of the scheme, the book's author Madonna King writes that the Prime Minister recalled a far more thorough conversation between himself and Mr Hockey . 'Joe was one of the very few colleagues whom I discussed the paid parental leave proposal with ... I don’t want to verbal Joe but he certainly saw the merit in it – that's not quite the same as saying he enthusiastically supported it,' Mr Abbott is quoted in the book as saying. Tony Abbott is believed to have proposed his $5.5 billion paid maternity leave scheme in a bid to improve his image among female voters. The plan has proved controversial with his party because of a proposed tax on big business to pay for it . However, Mr Abbott's decision to announce the plan resulted in a showdown with Mr Hockey saw the Prime Minister after the announcement on International Women's Day on March 2010. Mr Hockey said he was left 'irked' and 'offended' that although Mr Abbott had given him the Treasury portfolio, he had not been consulted on the massive $5.5 billion spending commitment to introduce the policy. Yet resolving the issue and talking it out like 'two old mates', Mr Hockey says in the book that the pair 'sort of had a heart-to-heart', where he told the then Opposition leader: 'We can't do this. It's not the way'. The conversation ensured a commitment between the two to support each other publicly, yet just one-year later, the Treasure was not supported by the Prime Minister when he suggested family trusts should be taxed the same way as companies. The paid parental leave scheme was considered by many to be a ploy to attract female voters, with Mr Hockey not initially sold on and threats at the time that MPs and senators could cross the floor to vote against it. Previously the scheme was to see six months paid leave at full salary up to $150,000 a year funded by a 1.7 per cent levy on company tax above $5 million to controversially cover the costs. Since first announced, Mr Hockey's stance has swayed and he stated he would support the scheme if the Coalition could assure its funding. Speaking after the launch of the book on Thursday morning, Mr Hockey did not answer questions regarding the fact Mr Murdoch was approached about the policy before he was. But he said Prime Minister Tony Abbott was an 'outstanding individual' who he got on well with. 'I think what's disappointing some commentators [about the book] is that we are are quite close,' he said. 'And that's a welcome change between a Treasurer and Prime Minister.'","Rupert Murdoch saw PM's paid parental leave scheme before Liberal and National Coalition members, a new book reveals .

"Cyber bullying and ‘sexting’ could be to blame for a surge in cases of anxiety in children, MPs warn. Some NHS trusts have reported a 25 per cent increase in the number of young people needing treatment for depression and self-harm in the past 12 months. MPs say the popularity of websites such as Facebook means bullying ‘follows children home’. Scroll down for video . Always connected: A report by the health select committee highlights figures from the charity Childline showing that there had been an 87 per cent increase in the numbers of calls from children about online bullying . They also warn that in some schools it is normal for boys to circulate sexual images of female classmates by text – known as sexting. This can be deeply upsetting for the young girls and lead to cruel remarks about their weight or breast size. MPs on the health select committee are urging the Government to launch an investigation into the extent of which the internet and text messages are harming children’s health. In a report today they highlight figures from some NHS trusts including Cornwall where referrals to clinics have increased by between 20 and 25 per cent since last year. These are for conditions including depression, anxiety, self-harming, eating disorders and attempted suicide. Whilst the MPs cannot say for sure that the internet and texting is to blame, they have created an environment where bullying is ‘there all the time.’ Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, chair of the Health Select Committee, said: ‘What children face now is that the bullying follows them way beyond the walk home from school. ‘For some young people it’s clearly a new source of distress.’ ‘Young women are finding they have shared an image in good faith but then it widely distributed online by young men in the classroom . ‘It’s become normalised within some school environments.’ The report highlights figures from the charity Childline showing that there had been an 87 per cent increase in the numbers of calls from children about online bullying. And the manager of one clinic in Northamptonshire said two thirds of children admitted in the past five years had been bullied online or via text messages. One psychiatrist who gave evidence to the MPs, Dr Sebastian Kramer, from the Whittington Hospital in North London said: ‘You can be teased in the playground and it is gone with the wind, but if you have got your photograph on Facebook it is there forever. He added that he had treated some girls who had been bullied online or by text to a ‘state of despair.’ Mental health epidemic: Some NHS trusts have reported a 25 per cent increase in the number of young people needing treatment for depression and self-harm in the past 12 months . The report also warns that more than half of boys and a fifth of girls spend two hours a night or more playing computer games. These can lead to loneliness and depression as they become progressively more withdrawn from family and friends. The MPs want schools to ensure that children are properly taught about the potential pitfalls of mobile phones, computer games and websites. These include Facebook and Ask.fm – whereby users post their pictures online and ask each other to answer highly personal questions. Overall the report warns that there are ‘serious’ and ‘ingrained’ problems in the NHS’s care for children and teenagers with psychological problems. This includes a severe lack of beds – one young girl with anorexia lost ten per cent of her body weight waiting for one to become available.","Internet and texting mean bullying is ‘there all the time', say MPs .

"Older adolescent girls across the world are increasingly experiencing severe anxiety and depression, a new Australian study has found. The review, which has been published in the in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, looked at 19 extensive studies conducted across 12 countries and found that teenage girls in Northern Europe, the UK and China are specifically experiencing an increase in mental health problems. The studies leader, Dr William Bor from the University of Queensland, told the Daily Mail Australia that a combination of cultural, schooling and economic factors are most likely to be leading to the growing problem.

The review looked at 19 studies conducted across 12 countries and found that teenage girls in Australia, Northern Europe, the UK and China are experiencing an increase in anxiety and depression . 'There appears to be increasing school distress amongst girls as they negotiate their way through the last parts of their school careers,' Dr Bor said. 'They face difficult choices and pressures and the modern education system appears to be more problematic for girls – so the issue there is the stress of making future decisions and how they cope with them.' However culture is also believed to have a significant impact on mental health issues within young women, who are well known to struggle with identity and appearance issues. 'Culture has high expectation on girls in terms of appearance and weight,' Dr Bor said. 'There's a lot of speculation about the pressure on girls in terms of early sexualization and concerns they have about body image. 'However, there is also  a third factor around increasing economic inequality, and that may be increasing pressures at school as well.' The studies leader, Dr William Bor from the University of Queensland said that a combination of cultural, schooling and economic factors are most likely to be the cause for the growing trend . Due to the data coming from an array of countries, Dr Bor said the exact reasons for the difference in results across genders was not entirely clear, but are most likely tied in with education and cultural pressures. 'Boys are also affected but they're not as affected,' he said. 'You can see in the results that the trend in boys and girls is going up, but what is very clear is that girls have almost double the anxiety and worries as boys. 'We don't yet know all the answers here – each country has different pressures on their young people – and one of the odd things is that America isn't showing this increasing trend. 'We also have to account for why we are seeing a rise in China –so it's clearly not just a western phenomenon.' Dr Bor recommended that parents, peers and medical professionals receive more education about depression and anxiety, including prevention programs being placed in high schools . 'The school factor is the common denominator and the most likely factor across the multiple countries.' Dr Bor recommended that parents, peers and medical professionals receive more education about depression and anxiety, including prevention programs being placed in high schools, to increase the chances of successful prevention and early intervention. 'One of the greatest issues is that  it could lead to higher rates of attempted and successful suicide - that's the greatest risk with anxiety and depression,' Dr Bor said. 'But having severe depression and anxiety in adolescence is also a predictor of having it in future life – about a quarter of kids go on to get the illnesses as adults so it is a risk factor for the future, and it also increases the likelihood of drug and alcohol abuse in adulthood.' Although the study has no conclusive figures on the number of youth suffering from anxiety and depression in Australia, a population survey will be releases in 2015 with extensive figures.

"Shocking failings in NHS care for diabetes patients are today exposed by figures revealing that 120 amputations take place every week. Officials say GPs are not monitoring patients properly or giving them vital advice on how to keep their condition under control. And each week, diabetes leads to a staggering 268 heart attacks, 325 strokes, 143 cases of kidney failure and 385 early deaths, according to other figures in the report. Scroll down to watch video . Officials say GPs are not monitoring patients with diabetes properly or giving them vital advice on how to keep their condition under control, leading to 120 amputations being carried out every week . The number of Britons with the condition has doubled in 20 years mainly due to obesity, causing an increase in people developing type 2 diabetes, and today it affects 3.8million. One in seven patients in hospital has the illness, and it costs the NHS £14billion a year. Nearly 90 per cent of patients with the condition have type 2 diabetes, which is usually caused by obesity. Yet the report by Public Health England warns that GP surgeries are not doing enough to help combat the condition. On average, just 36 per cent of diabetes patients are keeping their blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol at safe levels. All of this can be regulated by insulin injections, other medication or through simple lifestyle advice on weight loss, diet and exercise. But in some areas – including  West Suffolk – the proportion of patients who have their diabetes under control falls to 28 per cent. The number of Britons with the condition has doubled in 20 years due to obesity, and today it affects 3.8million . John Newton of Public Health England, the agency responsible for tackling health issues such as diabetes, said: ‘We need to create a sense of urgency in dealing with these future health problems which are facing our communities. Some practices are achieving good control but there is too much variation. ‘Practices are not being systematic enough about bringing patients in regularly and recording what investigations they’ve had done.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘We know that diabetes can have a devastating impact on people and we want everybody to get excellent care and support, regardless of where they live.’ They do not produce enough insulin and this causes their blood sugar to rise, leading to nerve damage. This can result in foot sores and amputations, blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks and strokes. The report shows that last year diabetes led to 6,298 amputations, 13,947 heart attacks, 16,910 strokes and 7,447 patients needing kidney dialysis or transplant. Barbara Young, chief executive of charity Diabetes UK, said: ‘This is just the latest in a long line of statistics that show that diabetes healthcare is hugely geographically variable and in many places is not good enough. ‘The public deserve more than politicians and NHS leaders wringing their hands about it but then failing to do anything meaningful to try to fix it.’ Martin McShane, of NHS England, which runs the health service, said: ‘A healthy lifestyle in adults at high risk of diabetes can halve the likelihood of suffering from the condition, but there is also a need for NHS England to support evidence-based treatment shaped to support individuals.’","The number of Britons with diabetes has doubled in 20 years mainly due to obesity .

"Scientists have revealed the first ever 3D map of bizarre astronomical phenomenon that has baffled scientists for nearly a century. The new map could help scientists explain what makes up the material that creates 'diffuse interstellar bands' or Dibs. These are dark lines in space that hide in the light. Scientists have known they exist since 1922, but they still don't know much about them. Scroll down for video . Scientists hope to use the map to explain what makes up the material that creates 'diffuse interstellar bands'. These maps show the amount of light absorbed by the DIB (left) and dust (right). Red shows more absorbed light than blue. Top maps are for northern Galactic hemisphere and bottom for southern Galactic hemisphere . Scientists believe cracking the mystery surrounding Dibs could arm them with valuable information on how stars and galaxies are created. To create the map, scientists focused on the single Dib 8620, one of over 400 absorption lines, with the goal of narrowing down its source. 'Dib 8620 does not seem special compared to other Dibs,' lead author Janez Kos, of the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, told Space.com. But, as a spectral feature often used to measure stellar motion, it is 'the most observed DIB.' Dibs are absorption lines that appear throughout the electromagnetic spectrum. They are caused by the absorption of light by matter in space. Four hundred Dibs have been seen - in ultraviolet, visible and infrared wavelengths - throughout space. Researchers have speculated that the absorption of starlight that creates these dark bands points to the presence of unusually large complex molecules, but proof of this has remained elusive. 'Diffuse interstellar bands' or Dibs are dark lines in space that hide in the light. A student who photographed the light from distant stars discovered these bands in 1922. Analysing rainbow-colour bands of starlight that have passed through space gives astronomers important information about the make-up of the space materials that the light has encountered. But in 1922, the student's photographs yielded some dark lines indicating that some starlight was 'missing'' and that something in the interstellar medium between Earth and the star was absorbing the light. Since then, scientists have identified more than 400 of these diffuse interstellar bands, but the materials that cause the bands to appear and their precise location have remained a mystery. Researchers have speculated that the absorption of starlight that creates these dark bands points to the presence of unusually large complex molecules, but proof of this has remained elusive. The nature of this puzzling material is important to astronomers because it could provide clues about the physical conditions and chemistry of these regions between stars. Such details serve as critical components in theories as to how stars and galaxies formed. Atoms in molecules give off light when their electrons change from one orbit to another. When the atoms crowd close to each other, one atom interferes with the spectrum of another. But as yet, nobody has found which molecules and atoms exactly correspond to the Dibs. The nature of this puzzling material is important to astronomers because it could provide clues about the physical conditions and chemistry of these regions between stars. In order to investigate Dib 8620, astronomers used the Radial Velocity Experiment (Rave) survey of stars in the Milky Way. Rave has the spectra of almost half a million stars across the galaxy, all located in the southern sky. The large size of the sample allowed mapmakers to determine the distances of the material that causes the Dibs, and how the material is distributed throughout space. The resulting maps showed the intriguing result that the complex molecules thought to be responsible for the Dibs are distributed differently than another known component of the interstellar medium - the solid particles known as dust. Future studies can use the techniques outlined in the new paper to assemble other maps that should further solve the mysteries surrounding where Dibs are located, and what materials cause them. 'To figure out what something is, you first have to figure out where it is, and that is what this paper does,' said Professor Rosemary Wyse, who is a professor of physics and astronomy at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. 'Larger surveys will provide more details in the future. This paper has demonstrated how to do that.' The nature of this puzzling material is important to astronomers because it could provide clues about the physical conditions and chemistry of these regions between stars. Such details serve as critical components in theories as to how stars (pictured) and galaxies formed .","Map could help scientists explain origin of diffuse interstellar bands (Dibs)
